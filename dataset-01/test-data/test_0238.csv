4,Who would believe this?!,"This book, based on facts is a real eye-opener. I was stunned at events that took place in the late 1890's as Chicago was preparing for the World's Fair. From a cunning maniacal murderer to architecture that influenced Frank Lloyd Wright and creativity that influenced Disney - at every turn, something was being created or destroyed. This book was educational and fascinating. I recommend this book to readers from mature teens, to all adults."
3,A Little of This a Little of That,"Book generally interesting but material regarding the serial killer and the fair not fully integrated, not that I could possibly make a constructive suggestion in this regard. Information concerning both the murders and the fair well and informatively written, especially the murders. If anything the material about the men directly and indirectly involved in the creation of the fair a bit forced, especially the occasional reference to Louis Henry Sullivan.I look forward to seeing a couple of documentaries about the ""White City"" to get a better overall take on the appearance of the fair. Paper back edition I purchased should have included a map and a few photos."
2,Not what I expected,"This was not what I expected. It was recommended as a great book. I guess if you are interested in architecture, it would be. I myself, like mysteries and thrillers, and thought there would be more intrique. Although I do like historical novels, this was very difficult to get through."
5,interesting - couldnt put it down,"this book is great history, thriller, fiction and non-fiction in one!"
2,I really wanted to like this book,"I bought this after reading the reviews and wanted something more suspenseful to read. I have tried and tried to read this book, but just cannot get into it. I will try again after a break (actually many breaks, I think I have read 3-4 books while trying to read this one) and see if the pace picks up. I just cannot recommend this one. I didn't feel it has mass appeal, if my opinion counts. Sorry - I really wanted to like it."
2,Did not live up to the hype,"Usually it takes me 3-5 days to read a book, after the 4th week I finally finished. Two stories that had a great premise never reach their potential."
4,The Devile in The White City,A good read. Historically very informative and entertaining. Made me want to find out more about the history of the Chicago fair and the protagonist.
3,Juxtaposition,"The clever literary device of linking construction of buildings with destruction of life worked only to a limited extent. I enjoyed the detailed history of the conception, design and construction of the World Expo far more than the rather murky and distasteful murders by the doctor. It's worth a read, but don't start with high expectations of riveting suspense."
5,Fabulous book for history of technology fans.,"Spell-binding book. Non-fiction at its best. Plenty of detail about all the new technology that appeared at the Fair, e.g. electric launches, colossal Ferris Wheel, electric lighting and more. Forms a perfect trilogy withEiffel's TowerandEmpires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World, both by Jill Jonnes."
4,The Part Dealing With the Fair is a Classic,"Larson's account of the fevered rush to put on the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 is more suspenseful than any mystery thriller. It's FASCINATING--a truly classic piece of writing.And the idea of contrasting the history of the Fair with a biography of serial killer Herman W. Mudgett (AKA H. H. Holmes) is a brilliant idea.But there is plenty of fascinating detail about Mudgett/Holmes. Why, then, did Larson feel the need to fictionalize the sections of his book dealing with Holmes?This isn't a fatal flaw, but it does detract from the book's overall impact."
2,Disappointing and slow moving,I bought this book because of the great reviews and also because I liked the authors other book 'In the Garden of Beasts'. Reading this book was like pushing mud uphill because it was such slow going. In excrutiating detail it describes the evolution of the Chicago World Expo in the late 1900's. There are endless boring details that drag on for whole chapters about meetings and infighting with the fairs organizers. The subplot about a serial killer seems like an afterthought to sell the book.I would not recommend this book unless you are fascinated by fairs and what goes into building and organizing them.
5,Power Cards- What a strategy!,"I am a special eduacation teacher in Illinois and work with children with autism spectrum disorder. I mainly work with children with high functioning autism and Asperger Syndrome. I have used the Power Card book several times and my district is adapting the strategy as one that really works with this population. My students can relate to their ""obsessions"" while learning rules- it's perfect! I have seen a significant increase in several target (preferred) behaviors with many students with autism and AS after the Power Card stratedy was implemented. I am big fan of this book. It's easy for anyone to use and I highly recommend it to parents and professionals."
2,Review,This book is for higher functioning individuals on the spectrum. It is for kids with very high coginitive abilities and comunication skills. The idea behind this book is to use the sometimes rigid interests of kids on the spectrum and teach them socially appropriate skills.
2,Recommended only if you don't need it!!,"The book has some fine features. But it doesn't explain anything. So, if you already know about chaos and want to read a brief review then probably it is ok (but read ahead). If you don't know about chaos you'll get lost.The book is too expensive for what it offers!!."
3,Ok but not the best,Ok I liked this book but I didn't love it. I just can't like Windhawk. He is loving in parts but for the most part he is a very violent man with anger issues who can't accecpt when he is wrong. He always thinks the worst of Joanna and caused her to become temporarly blinded because of his anger issues. Much of the misunderstanding between him and Joanna could have been resolved quickly if he had just told her he didn't attack the wagon train instead of being angry with her for not trusting him. I loved Joanna and Tag. I thought they were the best characters in the book. All in all the book wasn't bad but its a one or two time read. nothing more.
4,Does what it's supposed to,"This is a very small mortar and pestle, but it does what it's supposed to. I've used it twice with no problems."
4,A Beginners Guide To...,"This compilation of La Castañeda songs is very good. As it is it appeals to fans of the band and new listeners. 30 seconds is all you need to get hooked on them.This is a rollercoaster ride of a record. It will take you low and high several times before ending on a pretty mellow song with some very dramatic vocals.Some of the best songs in this album are la fiebre the norma, transfucion, noches de tu piel, sueños, la ultima noche, el loco, el hilo, and last but not least tumba matriz.Over all this is a great collection of songs from a superb band and a good alternative to the now hard to find, discography. I recommend this album if you like latin infused rock with some traces of jazz here and there. And if you dont, you will probably still like it if you give it a listen.And if you did like it... It's been my pleasure."
4,Lexar Jumpdrive is pretty nice,"This is in reference to the ""Horrible customer service, August 19, 2004 by SPM"" It is a USB flash drive!!If it needs reformatting, Format it!! To call Live support for a USB flash drive is overkill.Ok back to MY review, I already had a 256 flash drive from PNY, works fine but it seems a lil slow. Not USB1 slow but slower than other cards. that position was bolstered when I got this Lexar media drive. I copied a 115meg file fromt he same USB port and the tranfer for the Lexar was a lot smoother. the time started at 50 seconds and quickly progressed.. My other Card showed 2 minutes, then went to 60 secs and counted down. The Lexar has a speed advantage.ALso, Walmart is a selling an Impact 256 meg drive for $30. it has clear plastic and u can see the Lexar chip inside and when u plug it to ur comp, it shows Lexar.. worth the check out.."
5,great toy,This toy is one of the best toy in my collection I been looking for this toy for a long time
5,Eloquent and accessible,"Crossing Over teaches us about the migrant trail by sharing -- with great sensitivity -- how the participants themselves experience its tragedies while searching for hope and better lives for their children. Though a true story, it reads like a novel. Both eloquent and accessible, the book would make a great teaching text for a wide range of courses, at both the high school and college levels.Jonathan FoxProfessor and Department ChairLatin American and Latino StudiesUniversity of California, Santa Cruz"
1,Forget it....,Save your time and money....another diet book filled with so much nonsense it makes eating a chore. Make up your own way of eating and be happy. Avoid this one like a plague!!!
3,Almost fit,"There is a built in stop inside my 1 1/4 inch receiver hitch that prevented inserting the adapter far enough to align the holes for the hitch pin to be inserted. I was able to saw a 1/4 inch notch in the end of the adapter to allow it to work. After that, it worked as expected. I would have expected there to be standards for hitches and acessories to allow them to fit without modification. Other acessories such as my bumper tray fit without modification into the same hitch."
2,"I like Kurt Elling, I think!","I had not heard of Kurt Elling until I saw him on a TV special I think it was ""Live at Newport"" and he knocked me out. But then I went to a local store and listened to each of his albums and I went for Wow to MY GOD! I bought The Messenger which I like but something about Kurt Elling keeps eluding me - I can't figure out if he is the best singer I've ever heard or the worst singer! I don't go by the awards people win because in the Downbeat Poll years ago a bass player named Stubby Jackson kept winning for best bass player year after year mainly because nobody seemed to know anyone else to vote for. It is true that there are not many good jazz singer's around these days so perhaps Elling will grow on me?"
5,A constant pick-me-up (in both senses of the phrase),"This book is filled with hundreds of vignettes--some funny and some moving, but almost every one interesting (and NOT saccharine as I sort of expected them to be). I pick it up when I walk by it, read one, and feel re-connected and less numb. Give this to someone you know who's tired (it's easy reading) or sad or disconnected from daily reading or daily life. It revives the reader. Great stories. I hope NPR does another one."
4,NOT Chicken,"This is definitely not Chicken Soup and i couldn't be happier. I'm forcing myself to read this book slowly so the stories can soak in. These are REAL stories written by REAL people, not cheesy forwarded email drivel. The texture of so many voices, so many perspectives, so many characters is just wonderful. Anyone looking for fairytale endings is going to be disappointed, but if you're interested in hearing what touches the minds and lives of your fellow humans, this is a treasure trove."
4,The Touch of the Editor's Hand,"Like all anthologies, this one has pieces both strong and weak. Nevertheless, there were enough striking stories to carry me through the book. Auster's hand is sometimes perceptible, smoothing and refining these tales, but his presence is even more evident in the similar feel of the stories chosen. For instance, many blend irony and chance; a number emphasize shame for youthful prejudice; and over almost all hangs an indefinite non-theistic spirituality intended to strike a cord with the post-modern reader. I wonder what a similar anthology from 1900 or 1950 would have sounded like?"
1,Not even a Minor talent,"I'll keep this review short and simple: avoid this album! He is the most faceless and bland Country singer I've ever heard. Also, repeating ""I think you're beautiful"" in songs doesn't say much."
1,It's a good thing I'm respectful,"Slave to the habit? This is more like a slave to the all powerful dollar. This uninspired, lackluster, and boring lounge music is exactly what is wrong with Nashville. Has Shane Minor ever heard a country album? I'm willing to bet that the closest thing to country he's heard is Neil Diamond. No wonder a real talent like Robbie Fulks has trouble making it."
2,Nothing New,"Eh. This pretty much lists the most common games that 99% of us have played as kids. No real new or interesting games, unless you've never heard of Freeze Tag or Hide and Seek."
4,Interesting read,"I knew nothing about the USS Indianapolis except the short little reference to it in the JAWS movie, until now. The first 100 pages or so are the preliminary events that led up to the disaster with some terms and references that I am not familiar with, but they were not so complicated that I couldn't follow the story. After that ""all hell broke loose"".I found out, I think in necessary detail, just some of what these men endured during their 4 long days in the water. These men struggled for days to keep themselves and each other alive. Some were attacked by sharks, some drank the salt water, and some died from plain exposure to the elements. I had no idea what salt water could do to the human body and these men could not escape it.It's an amazing story."
5,IN HARM'S WAY,"My husband was given this book and after he read it I couldn't put it down, I was mesmerized by the book and the writing and all the things we haven't heard about this particular incident in World War II....I have now bought two more books to give as presents for Xmas and another three books will be purchased for my son in laws and son to keep and read and pass on to their friends. Don't miss reading this one....Doug Stanton gave me the chance to read and visualize every heartbreaking moment in the life of the men that served on the USS Indianapolis...Its not just for men, ladies just pick it up and see for yourself. Barb Frick"
4,A triumph of the human spirit,"The sinking of the USS Indianapolis, and the harrowing account of how its survivors fared while stranded at sea, is the subject of In Harm's Way by Doug Stanton. It is an often terrifying look at the ordeal these men underwent, first to survive an enemy attack only to then be forced to contend against starvation, dehydration, sunstroke, and shark attack. Often heart-wrenching, but ultimately an amazing true story of the tenacity and triumph of the human spirit."
2,beware,"This product is a disappointment and more so the company I purchased it from. Requested to change phone to more coasty one, but didn't get responce. And I now have it sitting in a draw."
1,bad....,"Bought Motorola v220 . After 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden. Heard it's a common problem for v220. Everything else was good..."
2,This phone won't last,"I bought 2 of these phones @ the same time. My son abused his while I took very good care of mine. In less than one year neither would work unless it was on speaker phone, I was told by someone @the phone store that this was a common problem.Nearly impossible to see display in sunlight. On the plus side,I found this phone very easy to use ,including using it for text messaging."
1,3 phones all died!,"I had this phone for about 6 months and the screen went black, so I couldn't use it anymore. I got a new one free... 3 months later I start hearing static all the time even when I have fine service... two weeks later the screen goes black again. I get a new one, it's just now now starting to break. When I open it up it takes the screen a long time before it will come up and then it flicks off and comes up again. Motorola should send me a new phone that works.DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!"
1,Not the full version of WP 10!,"This package states that it comes with WordPerfect 10 and nowhere does it say that it is anything but the FULL version. But it is NOT! After installing, I was astounded to learn that there is NO search function (Quickfinder)! I don't consider searching files to be some ""full featured professional"" function that can just be dropped from a ""home"" version-- it's pretty basic stuff. How Corel can just drop it is beyond me. Oh sure, it may be some third-party software that would have additional licensing fees, but give me a break! What good is a word processor without the ability to search its own files?!?! Shame on COREL!"
1,Just not worth it,"I was disappointed with this product--thankfully I didn't pay much for it. I had difficulty importing files from other word processors, and it locked up on me several times. Seems to me a lot of features are missing that are available in other word processors, too. Anyways, I uninstalled it and bought a Microsoft product. The incompatibilty issues of WordPerfect Family Pack were just too bothersome to deal with.I can't recommend this to anyone (unless you need a word processor to design birthday banners)."
1,no suction cups!!,i bought this item thinking it would come with suction cups to use to hang from my car window. it didn't. i couldn't hang it from my car window like it suggests because my windows are too thick!
3,Don't Buy,"Had I known that this ""reference"" book was published back in 1991 I never would have bought it. Much too out of date. I believe I was deceived by the Amazon bookseller."
5,A must-have home reference book,"This book has been an invaluable reference many times-relieving pain and discomfort more than a few times--and leaving me fuming that the doctors I visited didn't bother to provide information that could have been helpful. It has made me realize just how many doctors work with blinders on--hand the patient a prescription or tell them to ""live with it"" if the prescription doesn't work. This book does offer more--it explains why certain health problems arise and provides research and various alternative remedies--the ones the doctor didn't tell you about because they don't involve prescriptions. The book has in-depth topic discussions, provides the reader with the trade-offs involved in various remedies, and all-in-all, is simply a wonderful reference book that pays for itself many times over. It's all about what you can do to help yourself. NOTE: If they truly want to help patients, all doctors should read this book!!!"
4,Everyone should have this just for alternatives,"Are you beginning to think that society is becoming over-medicated? Do you pop an aspirin or pain reliever every time you get a muscle ache or headache? How about dropping a quick $25 for your co-pay to your doctor that tells you ""Can't really do anything for you. It just needs to run it's course"". Next time, save that co-pay and spend it right here. Great suggestions for ""alternative"" (I use that loosely. Nothing ""freaky"" in this book) ways to help with your ailment. Great suggestions that work with your body and not against it; which requires more pills to offset the side affects of the pills you are taking. Sound familiar?"
2,Arrived damaged - lacks enough in-depth info about each remedy/condition,"The copy I purchased from Bargain Books was listed as in ""good"" condition. It was actually in very poor condition. Several sections of pages had fallen out at some point and had been re-glued into the spine... out of order.The content of the book is OK - a decent introduction to homeopathic remedies, but there is not nearly enough in-depth information about how to produce/administer the remedies... or maybe those sections were just glued somewhere else in the Franken-copy I received.If I could, I'd give 1 star for the seller and 3 stars for the content, so I'll settle on 2 for this item."
3,Could Have Been Great,The plot fits the known facts. The love story of Charles Brandon and Mary Tudor was well-imagined and plausible. It is a fast read and leaves one satisfied at an average level.What then was wrong? The facts were there--the great love story of Charles and Mary. A marriage that was treason. A dowry that was released by the new King of France after only a three-month marriage. An enraged Henry but one who succumbed--although he extracted a high financial price that was paid by Charles and Mary for years.Mary was a beautiful and charming woman....but how did she handle power and how did she charm such powerful men? This power was certainly later seen in Elizabeth I. The love between Charles and Mary was there in the writing but seemed to lack the great passion that fits the known facts.The book was good...but could have been great.
3,Very Nice!!! Could have been a bit better!,"This Movie was preaty ok but it was that very long! I wached that is a little bit longer then 17 minutes long and the actuall Time on the box that says ""35"" Minutes (I'm not totally sure!) But Still prehaps they re-do it and sell it again!"
2,just ok,"This video is just ok, it is very short and does not have a lot on it. We also have Kids Favorite Songs Two which my daughter loves and thought she would like this too, but not so much. Really it is just a bunch of older Sesame Street songs from various episodes put together. Get the 2nd one instead."
1,I really wanted to like this,"Come on, who doesn't want to like Big Bird? In the end, this just fell short. Way, way short! The movie is way way too short, for starters. My little ones LOVE their Trebellina DVD, nothing else I have tried has come close to getting the mileage that one has. Educational and entertaining AND 30 full minutes."
5,Its great!!!,"I brought this video for my 1 and 3 year old. They love it! They like to sing along with the songs and dance. It is very entertaining. This is one I dont mind seeing over and over again. I would also recommend Kids Favorite Songs 2. I think the first one is a little better, but the second one is great also."
5,The ABC Song,"This video taught my 20 month old daughter how to sing the alphabet song! She marches around the house singing her ABC's, thanks to Telly. The rest of the songs are non-annoying; I would highly recommend this video."
3,Pretty Annoying,"This one's pretty bad. Features 10 songs, including three to the same tune (ABC, Baa baa Black Sheep, and Twinkle Twinkle). They are all sung screechily by Sesame Street characters. The one upside, both my 18 mnther and 3 yr old learned to count backwards from 10 from this movie. There are better ones out there."
3,"Interesting, but neutral and some what sympathetic","To begin with this was a very interesting book, however it glosses over and is neutral when it comes to discussing the atrocities and policies that Mao pioneered and carried out. I would recommend that anyone who is interested in Modern Chinese history read this. However I woul also recommend, and for me a far more insightful biography is the one written by Jung Chang, the unknown Mao. Prehaps it is a cultural problem, Philip Short was not directly affected by Mao Jung Chang was. I have been living, studying and working in China for over 8 years and this is helping me understand more about chinese history, from a chinese point of view, rather than from a western point of view."
5,EXCELLENT SELF HELP GUIDE,"UPON READING THIS BOOK I WAS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE ADULT PROBLEMS I WAS HAVING FROM INCEST. PREVIOUS TO READING THIS GUIDE I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND MY INABILITY TO SLEEP AT NIGHT, OR TO STAY FOCUSED ON TASKS,DEPRESSION. THIS BOOK HAS HELPED TO UNDERSTAND MANY EFFECTS I HAVE HAD AS AN ADULT BUT NEVER NEW COULD BE THE RESULT OF INCEST. IF YOU ARE AN INCEST SURVIVOR I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO YOU."
5,Unknown Wonder!,"Having been recommended this film by numerous friends, I broke down and saw it. I was astonished that I had not heard alot of hype about it, because its that good. Buy it!"
2,snooze,"This movie was recommended to me by a friend who said it was ""better than American Beauty"" but I completely disagree. It was boring and really went nowhere. The characters were uninteresting, beyond the first 30 minutes. I lost all interest in the story and I am a movie buff and particularly a fan of quirky flicks like this *seemed* to be."
2,Promising but dissatisfying...,"This movie starts out pretty well, as a spoof of suburban life. The friendship between Devon, the girl, and Trent, the lawn mower guy, is well portrayed and touching at times. But the movie's tone is inconsistent, and many situations end abruptly. The final sequence is a very strange choice; it just doesn't fit in with the rest of the story. Not highly recommended."
3,"Not bad, but nothing new","After having read New England Comics's Tales Too Terrible To Tell collection, and a lot of the wonderful EC reprints from Russ Cochran/Gemstone, I have to reassess this book. While Sennitt keeps the book moving, his work is extremely derivative. His anti-EC bias is also way off base, and just plain old tiresome after a while. I did enjoy his stuff on Warren and Skywald, but he's no athority on pre-code.For that, the above-mentioned TTTTT, and Mike Bentons Illustrated History of Horror Comics (if you can find it cheap) are recommended."
1,Beware,"Purchase 200GB unit, two went bad within weeks and Maxtor will only keep exchanging. Lost alot of time and data, unit kept wanting to be formated. NO solution from Maxtor support. Don't buy these units if info is important."
4,Jeff Dunham,Jeff Dunham in his younger years are OK but not as funny as the more mature years. The current shows are greater than the previous one. Jeff Dunham is great and getting better than previous years.
2,Too early in his career,This tape was early in Jeff's career. He has gotten better over the years. someone who is familiar with his current level of work would be disappointed.
2,"""Back to my roots"" comeback attempt.","Apparently trying to save face after the disappointing sales of his 1994 pop album ""Gracias Por Esperar,"" Gabriel borrowed a page from Hank Williams Jr.'s playbook and tried to cash in on wrapping himself in the (Mexican) flag with a CD replete with nostalgia, pastoral romanticism and a little xenophobia. Though Gabriel claimed to really believe his I-can't-stand-gringos rhetoric, it's important to remember he'd had troubles with the IRS not too long before. His subsequent willingness to accept corporate sponsorship from Sears Roebuck also raised questions about his sincerity."
5,Can't Wait for the Next One!!!,"Just finished this, and all I can say is that I certainly wasn't disappointed. The usual cast of characters is back (Smithback, et al) and the story just rolls along. We are left hanging - but wasn't that the way Brimstone ended? Not scary as some of these guys' previous books, but definitely worth turning off the phone and sending the family away for."
2,"Diluted...Diluted...Diluted...and, yet, Diluted AGAIN!!","Ok, this is ridiculous! These guys had to work with an excellent character (refined, rich, supersmart special agent Pendergast), his mirror-image villain (true, a little too mirror image for my taste...) and a decent story - and, yet, managed to ruin the whole thing by turning a one-book-story into a trilogy!There are chapters and whole subplots with only marginal impact on the storytelling - chapters that could had been easily ommitted.For example (no spoiler, not to worry): Smithback gets committed to an insane asylum, attempts to escape, manages to do so so easily he could be simply exiting a ...hotel! Value added to the story: zero.They most probably did not telephone this one in, yet there are plot corners left unfinished. Diogene's motive is at best shallow and unworthy of his intellect for example...OK for a gloomy weekend, but definitely NOT ONE OF THEIR GOOD ONES!"
2,I even named my cat Smithback,"I'm afraid to read this one because I hated, hated, hated Brimstone, I thought it was garbage. It was jarring to read a bad book by these guys. (Yeah, what *does* Pendergast see in Vinnie anyhow?)I used to love Preston/Childs, counted on them for wonderful reads and I'm so sad about the direction their stuff has taken, it's like an old friend is suddenly dead."
4,People like Us,Inthought it was a very good movie although it was not the besy movie. Like the title it was about everyday people like us
2,"overacted. good story, poor acting","The storyline was good but was ""overacted"". i expected more from a movie with Michelle Pfeifer. The director dragged the movie at times as if he was running out of material. The movie could have been completed in 30 minutes. I wonder how many pages the original book is; probably no more than 50 pages."
3,"Weird and uncomfortable, but ended well.","This show took awhile to really get going. A lot of angry reflecting on the guys part about his dad that could have been cut. The acting was great applause for Michelle Phifer who played a supporting role. The whole Brother- sister thing tho was very distracting to the good story. I don't understand why he didn't tell her when it was obvious she was falling in love with him. It just got more and more uncomfortable until the major fight scene. I just don't see how you could then say ""oh hey I see you as a brother now"". Just odd. But the end of the movie really brought the whole story full circle. I wish it would have just left out the insest love story:}~Sex- One scene where she attacks a neighbor, very short and no nudity. Flirting and cleavage.Language- Some, sparse no F word.Violence-A fight between her and him, she hits him.Alcohol and pot."
3,"""Not My Thing""","Don't care to leave a review!It is just not my kind of movie.Sorry.My wife liked it,but even she said she has seen better."
4,Good Chick Flick,"I'm a dude, however I like a good chick flick when it's presents itself. I thought the acting was good and the story believable."
2,5 Star reviewers work for Gentle Air,"I find it highly odd that all of these 5 star reviewers only have 2 reviews each, both for ""Gentle Air"" products.I don't own it. I found the product amusing and was reading the reviews out of curiosity when I noticed they all must work for Gentle Air.Just a bit of buyer-beware from a bored shopper."
3,Only Okay,"I guess I was expecting something better, but I should have realized for the price it wasn't the quality I wanted. I'll be using this as a spare until I find where I miss placed my good one.It is better than the really cheap ones, but not as good as the ones that cost around $30. If you only need one ocassionally, this will work."
1,It's a piece of junk on a Mac too,"The Maxtor OneTouch 250 GB Firewire for Mac drive that I bought causes system freezes on our PowerBook and twin processor G4.It is unreliable and owning it has been a nightmare.The power supply went out in the first week and the replacement drive refuses to mount most of the time.In other words what the PC users report goes for the Mac version too.If you're looking to buy peace of mind by getting a backup drive, don't buy a Maxtor."
1,DOA from the Box...,"I bought this product from CompUSA thinking what a great idea to have so much more storage.Unfortunately, it was DOA. I plugged in the power supply and nothing. There is a small, green LED on the power supply transformer block that's supposed to light up when you plug it into a circuit. No green light meant I didn't even get a chance to turn it on!The instructions say to plug the HD end first, then the transformer block into the wall. Does the order matter that much?The green light never turned on! I'll be taking it back to CompUSA tomorrow and return home with another. We shall see what happens.Another issue is that the autorun ""launch.exe"" (the software installation CD) pops up quickly in XP Pro, but then disappears! Yes, even when I double-click that file, the installer does not come up! WTF?"
1,DRIVE FAILED. 18 Months old.,"Here's my review: I won't be buying Maxtor again.The drive failed within 18 months. Not sure if I'll recover the lost data. I've never had a drive fail, so this is very disappointing.Moral of story: Find a better external hard drive company. It seems there are too many similar stories to convince me to buy Maxtor again."
2,Nice idea - questionable reliability,"I'm dealing with mysterious system hangs and a ""Onetouch"" process that seems to launch randomly and take all my system CPU cycles so everything runs really slow. Killing the process fixes the problem until I reboot. But the hangs seem to be getting worse."
5,"Very, very funny",Excellent read. Understated and wry sense of humor. A must-read for people on both sides of the border who enjoy good writing.
4,"Good results, Fast, Inks Cheap :)","My HP 882C was still working great, kinda slow and it was really buggin me the way ink refills were almost $50. Time to get something that doesn't cost nearly $100 for both colour/black ink at the same time. Enter the Canon i560. This baby's fast, more quiet, inks about $20 for black and $20 for each of the 3 colour tanks. This is cool because you can just buy the colour that ran out instead of a complete tri-colour cartridge like my old HP.Borderless printing on prints with Canon's Easy Photo Print software. Easy web page printing with Canon's Easy Web Print software that intergrates itself with IE.4x6 prints turned out awesome in less than 30 secs, text came out crisp and black. Only con was the printer is a bit expensive at $149. When all was done and said...tax and extended warrenty that gives me free replacement for 2yrs the whole deal was just shy of $200cdn."
4,"Great printers, consumes ink quickly","I've had a canon 500 series for a while and its a very solid printer. Not a speedster at all, but the print quality is great, reliability has been perfect, and software support is very solid (e.g., t-shirt transfers which need to be inverted were included via one choice in print setup).The issue with this (and probably other color inkjets) is that the price is very misleading. It's the cost of ink that will really be the cost, they run out pretty quickly, and the replacement cartridges are very expensive. If you don't mind that aspect, its a great printer."
5,Best printer,This was my best purchase so far. The printer is fast and very quiet. Ink consumption is low and color are bright.
3,Good printer,Well I have had it now for 2 years its a good black and white printer and yes a good color printer for now color photos. I would not recommend this printer for photos and it can become expensive if you buy the cannon catridges for the $120 I paid should have been a bit cheaper and you can get the catridges on a auction site for a ton cheaper I got 5 black and white for $13 so I still use it for general printing clear printing but use it often so not to clog the heads now I would reccomend taking a look out there see if the technology has gotten better and cheaper if you get a deal on it go for it if not keep looking for now.
1,A lemon i560 or shall I say a piece of junk!,"After reading all those excellent reviews and the $30 rebate convinced me to get this printer. On arrival I excitedly followed all the instructions, putting in the print head and color ink tanks. Installed the softwares and I proceed to make my 1st print, guess what the print head moved back and forth but only white paper spitted out. Nothing was printed. Called the Canon support who was very helpful. Walked me through and did a dozen deep cleaning and other dianostics. Still it doesn't print. What a piece of junk this is. Don't buy this printer is my advice. Now I have to send this back for replacement and its bulky too. The $30 rebate is just not worth the trouble."
5,I love this printer!,"I bought this printer over 5 years ago because it was cheap and I needed something to print work documents. I have now printed THOUSANDS of pictures on it and have never had an issue!I love how it nestles many sizes of paperI love the speed of printing, especially document printing.I love that the ink doesn't cost more than the printerThe quality of the printed page depends on what you send to the printer. Coupled with a good camera, there's no difference in the pictures I print and the pictures I have developed at the drug store. If you're a beginner who's looking to start printing your own pictures, don't get rooked into buying an expensive printer. This is the perfect option for you!I also have no issues with printing on plain paper or cardstock. This is the ultimate scrapbooking tool!When this one goes bad, I'll be buying another one. Even after 5 years of use, I have no desire to upgrade to anything else."
5,Great Bang for Your Buck,I owned an Epson printer that went out. I came back to Canon and am much happier. The Photo quality is unbelievable. the printer is reasonably quiet and very fast. The best thing is that the replacement cartridges (something most dont think about) are very inexpensive. Overall the best deal you can get for a Great Home Printer. You will never need to get pictures developed at the store again. Yeah Canon
5,What a great printer!,This printer is a gem. I upgraded from a Lexmark Z12 (my first printer) and I could not be happier with the quality of prints and the operation. I use it for my online business and my other job. The four ink cartridge system lets me print for months before having to replace any of them. Call me 'Happy'.
4,Good printer for many years,"First of all, since when does a $100 printer become $230 5 years after is was released.Ok, now the review. When I got this printer with my Dell Dimension in 2003 it was top of the line. It was my family printer until 2007 when I decided I needed a scanner printer combo with networking compatibility. While I was waiting for a good deal on such a printer this printer when crazy. First it printed in only purple, then blue, then blue and black. After going through $40 worth of Cyan ink cartridges I shoveled out money for a new printer.All in all this was an excellent printer for many years but they're are now better things on the market.I am now selling my old Canon i550 for a reasonable $25 dollars. If you can fix it please buy."
3,"Great Band, Great Performance, Horrible Sound Quality","When it come to the Aces, ""the WORST I ever had was wonderful"". I have all their LPs, except the live one, so was pleased to find this release. The performance is great, just as Aces' live performances are, but the CD really sounds as though it was made from an old recording that was cleaned up with filters. Clearly, someone wanted to capitalize on the lack of Aces' material on CD. Absolute fans will want it, but others, probably not. Get ""Out of the Blue"" and ""Ride Again"" instead. Out of the Blue is one of the finest LPs I have purchased in the last few years."
1,What a disppointment,"I was thrilled when they came out with ""Ride Again"". It was the Aces from the old days. And ""Out Of The Blue"" gave us some good new material. But this one was a real disappointment. I should have guess by the title that it was a live album - recorded in concert, and it sounds like it. Not only does the music sound dead, and sometimes muffled, but the group sounds tired. I was way excited about hearing some of my old favorites in CD quality, but no such luck. Come on guys, do another ""Ride Again"". You can do so much better than this."
3,Not bad for the price,"Not as comfortable as I would have hoped, but for the price, it's a good quality shirt. The fabric is a little heavier, so wearing it in the summer time was a little uncomfortable, but otherwise it was a good buy."
1,2nd Maxtor Drive Failed in 2 Years,"I bought this drive in Feb of 2005. Five months later, it crapped out. Maxtor sent me another one and I was able to recover nearly everything with the assistance of some great computer people. Not even a year after receiving the new drive, it failed today! It's clicking and squeaking. Not the sound you want from your hard drive. I am terrified to buy a Seagate drive now that they have acquired/bought Maxtor. I am not sure where I will turn from here, but I will NEVER buy another Maxtor product -- waranteed or not. My data is too valuable to trust to this company."
1,Frustrated,I attempted to install this drive 2 days ago. Following the instructions exactly resulted in corruption of my primary drive and eventually I had to reinstall the operating system loosing the very data I purchased this drive to protect.Once the OS was reinstalled the Maxtor drive installed fine .. too late!
4,All 250 gigs are there,"In a previous post a customer complained that the whole 250 gigabytes of drive space are not available for use. The whole 250 gigs ARE there. They just do not show up in windows as that. ALL hard drives are like that. For instance I have a 200 gig drive that shows up as 186. I have another 120 gig drive that shows up as 111 , etc. SO, there is nothing wrong with the drive. That is just how it shows up in windows. If you look at the startup screen before windows loads, (the first screen that lists all the drives detected) It will show the full 250 gigs!If you are still curious why, research it! There are plenty of soiurces out there that will go into more detail."
1,does not work with Panther osX,Those guys don't know anything about Apple. This product does not work with Panther. It is also amazingly slow under XP
3,Alman Mulo Band - 'Afrodiziac Dream Time' (Taste),"Early '90's Harvey Bainbridge effort, have to admit that I've really never been much of a fan of this Hawkwind related band - but this CD is okay I guess. Believe this is the second Alman Mulo Band title I'ver ever heard. Tunes that I was semi-impressed with were ""It Could Be Day"", ""What's In It For Me"", the eight-minute ""All At See"" and the rocking ""Warriors Of Ancient Times"". Think he has like five other titles out and the only one I've heard before is 'Orisha'."
4,Pretty practical,"My only complaint is that there is not a big enough pocket accessible without lifting the big flap (other than the main compartment). My phone, wallet, keys don't fit into the only small pocket on the front which is a bit annoying. Other than that i like it. Big enough to get everything in and comfortable to carry. I like the different straps."
5,Better than five stars,"This is a fantastic performance of one of Handel's greatest operas. How can you go wrong? This work stars four of the greatest German singers of the 20th century--Walter Berry as Caesar, Christa Ludwig as Cornelia, Fritz Wunderlich as Sextus and Lucia Popp as Cleopatra, not to mention that the Munich Philharmonic is conducted by Ferdinand Leitner. In a word this work is fantastic. For an Opera D'Oro the sound is first-rate. I think the fact that it is sung in German adds authenticity to the music. But the clincher is having these four absolutely outstanding singers together in this work. If you love the music of Handel (is there someone in the world who does not?) buy this today."
5,Best 'little crab in the brook'! Krebs organ works complete,This is part of a set of six CDs of the Complete J L Krebs Organ Works. Priory should be very proud of their contribution to the recording world. The American recording industry can learn a superb lesson from them. Priory is unafraid to tackle a project and complete it. It has one of the best libraries of Organ CDs and Choral CDs with topnotch performers. At present I have over 150 of their CDs and am very happy with all of them. Take time to search out their Catalog and get their CDs. Lovers of Choirs and the Organ will not be disappointed.
1,Fact or Fiction?,"I'm in this book and know many of the pro-life activists described. If the accuracy of the episode involving me is any judge, the book is more fiction than fact.Painting this episode as a cloak and dagger conspiracy illustrates the bias of these authors, which is amply demonstrated throughout the book, as well as in the title itself.My advice to potential buyers? Don't waste your time or money."
5,Reader,This was a great book this is my fav out of all 15 of them. I like the part when ty asks amy to dance at the grants christmas party.I also liked it at the end when ty kisses Amy.
5,An excellent read,"Earthquake Weather is the final book in Powers Fisher King trilogy, which begins with Last Call and continues in Expiration Date. Earthquake Weather is a very satisfying and totally gripping conclusion to the story, with a wide scope, ranging with Powers' usual eclecticism, from ghosts to winemaking to electroshock therapy. His fully believable characters include a 14-year old boy destined to be the next Fisher King and a woman with multiple personalities. He intertwines a complex plot, supernatural events, and historical background in a thoroughly satisfying structure, keeping the reader in suspense and caring about the characters throughout the novel."
4,Fun music,"Lindley's version of ""Mercury Blues"" ROCKS! It left me wanting more. The musicianship is excellent. The songs choices are fun. What's not to like? I highly recommend this album!"
4,"""El Rayo-X"" is a party record...","""El Rayo-X"" can't disappoint that many people. If you need steady music at the party for all ages - this is it! David Lindley has splendid style, a tremendous musician who can really grab you and take you for a ride. This is a rare mix of cool Reggae/Ska, Rock and everything in between... To pick out a favorite song or anything like that is futile, I'll suggest you put this record on and boogie all night."
3,Fast Break,"This light-hearted story uses the basketball court of a small unknown southern university to depict the struggle of a group of talented individuals who come together to escape the poverty which surrounds them and the society which has forgotten them. Taken from the inner-city, each player, some reluctantly, join Gabe Kaplin as he travels across the county in an effort to produce something that the university has never had before, a winning basketball team. Paid only for each game he wins, Kaplin's original motivation seems to be a financial one. As time passes however, this set of individuals learn to overcome their differences to become a winning team... both on and off the court. In short a simplistic, enjoyable, and romantic comedy."
2,Bad Instructions,"I'd say this product was bad for a non-techie user. There were no instructions and, even though there was a graphic that showed my computer was ""clean,"" I never was totally sure that it had done what I wanted it to. I'm assuming it did and I gave away my PC but I'm still not 100% comfortable."
1,Dont buy from Ireland,"this was a wast of money for me as it would not work on my computer, I also bought another Cd rom from the USA and that would not work either, the format is different but your not told this when you but from the states, expensive to ship also."
2,This dreadful-sounding Elektra should be passed up...,".. in favor of the much better sounding Orfeo reissue. Opera lovers have waited decades for the Salzburg Festival to release the official tapes of this legendary live Elektra from 1957, and until they obliged finally, one had to make do with various horrible sounding pirates, of which this home-radio version, with its bad pitch and wobble, must be the worst. (I review the performance under the Orfeo listing)."
4,Bruce covers a handful of moods very effectively,"I agree with Glenn J Wiener, with the music fan from Minneapolis, and with any others who say that this album is underrated. It is! I liked it a lot when it was released, and I still do. The songs are strong and the playing, while perhaps lacking some of the personality of the E Street band, is nevertheless workman-like and effective enough. And Bruce, who was obviously in a restless state when this (and Human Touch) was released, is in very good voice. Speaking personally, my wife and I used the beautiful If I Should Fall on a wedding mix CD we made to give to our guests. It's a gorgeous tune, as is Beautiful Reward. And songs like Better Days, Lucky Town and Leap of Faith sound triumphant. So it's a record that covers a handful of moods, but covers them very effectively, something Bruce Springsteen can do so very well."
1,Good Riddance!,"I'm so glad that this weasel's 15 minutes of fame have come to an end. He seemed more like a circus act than an R&B singer. Anyway, ""Thong Song"" is revolting and I prefer listening to the instrumental version. Who wants to hear someone singing about women's draws?"
5,Thong Song,I like the way the video was created and the way you sing in the song. Please write me back Sisqo I will alwaysb be your #1.P.S. If you have a concert please hold some tickets in the front row. Thank You!

1,terrible,"Will somebody please explain to me the way in which religious people are 'sheep'? Fine, the whole evangelical movement is just whacked up, but it's no more pathetic than a bunch of juvenile minds walking around like they're better than everybody else because they read a book by a guy who obviously knew how to exploit the adolescent need to rebel (and his ability to do that so well has earned him that one star). Oh, will some satanists PLEASE e-mail me and tell me how much of a 'sheep' I am and how much of a 'great man' LaVey is so I can absolutely tear them to shreds? Com'on, if you think yer 'ard enough!"
4,Condition and Context,"Overall the condition was near-perfection and the content of this book is interesting to say the least, I strongly recommend it to anyone"
3,Not a perfect book,"When I was younger I was influenced by anything dark or Gothic. I decided to purchase the Satanic bible by Anton Lavey. Yes, the book is plagiarized by other authors and their works. But I did enjoy what the author wrote about being a your own individual. This book is not the best choice to learn about individualism. I would like to say Ayn Rand's works are very influential and a lot her material influenced the Satanic bible text."
5,The Satanic Bible,"Well, as Peter H. Gilmore said in the Introduction to the newest edition of this book, it has changed my life. If you're a Satanist you know that after reading this is when you took upon that title. You won't find Satanic Priests going about handing these out: you have to find it. The basic philosophy of Satanism is written herein, and with it you will have concrete evidence of a tool you can use to get the absolute most out of life."
1,"Good basis, but idk if this ever had to go on paper...","But he made a load of money off of it didnt he!! This book was just the begining of a huge joke which is modern satanism. He took what had been a brutal cult ritualistic religon, and toned it down for the avg. 13 yr old into the 'evils' of rock and roll to grab on to, and now its a big buisness between their corny web page and huge web store w/ everything from pins to cups they are makin a bucketload. What a load of crap, dont bother with this garbage, even if the logic makes sence. The logic in this book is natural type logic, satanism was never meant to be published."
3,Fun,"I thought the book a refreshing morsel, however I cannot wholy ascribe to its tenets; the lusty hedonist in all of us would agree, what a great read! However, that the book supports independent, intelligent evaluation of religious doctrine is meritable.The Enochian Prayer Keys are very interesting, but as far as angelology goes, I'm certainly no expert.If nothing else, this book is a great template for anyone wanting a fresh perspective, but could easily have been extrapolated from a basic college course in philosophy."
3,Overrated,"This is a great simplification of ideas from Ayn Rand and Epicurus. Nothing new here, except a lot of anti-Christian rhetoric. Ok, Anton, we get it, you don't like Christianity, now can you tell us what you do believe? And I really don't see the point of dressing up like Satan and having rituals. It all seems very childish to me. In conclusion, this is a fun book for teenagers to read who are exploring new concepts. But educated adults will not be able to take it very seriously."
3,Satanic Bible,"The product itself was in excellent condition upon arrival, but the book left somewhat to be desired. It's basically a composite of information from several different resources including Anton LaVey's own opinions on the subject matter. There is some material from Aleister Crowley, John Dee, and others that has been distorted (or plagiarized) and presented as LaVey's work, and some of the material contradicts LaVey's ideas and statements in other sources such as his book, ""Satan Speaks"". In this reviewer's opinion, the text of the Satanic Bible should be studied only in the light of context information from the prior sources mentioned as well as information available from former and present members of the Church of Satan, founded by the Black Pope himself.SHEMHAMFORASH"
4,well its like this,"well i should start by not biting anyones heads off, as ive seen people do when reviewing this book, however this book asks many questions and makes you think about your spirituality. I did in fact enjoy this book as it validated itself very well. This book is surely misunderstood but without it what would christianity be- nothing, I think that all christians should read this book. also Mr. LaVey reveals how christianity warped the identity of many pagan gods making them out to be evil when thats just nonsense-----This is a great read!!!!!"
3,really? a Bible?,I got this book for research on religions. This book is about psychology and human behavior then a religion. If you want to know about either psychology or human behavior I would recamend this book.
1,The Full Truth about The Satanic Bible,"The Satanic Bible written by Lavey, who dropped out of high school in his junior year, is foul. Lavey complains about other religions' hypocrisy, all the while this book is filled with it. Lavey only tells what intelligent and wise people already know about humans. The rituals leave much to be disired. All in all, I was extremely disapointed I wasted money on this book, even if it was only seven dollars. The only book written by Lavey I would recommend is The Satanic Rituals, because it contains rituals from orders the likes of the Illuminati, and the Freemasons."
3,Good for what it is,"Good book, but too self-indulgent for my taste. I give it three just for the unique read and interesting view points, but I couldn't live this way. After all, at some point in our lives, we are all weak, so should we be taken advantage of??? For a more balanced view of satanism/luciferianism, check out geocities.com/church_of_the_fallen666It's a group that started a religion around The Devil's Apocrypha."
2,Another Hypocritical Religion,"Yes, some people should educate themselves since true Satanists do not believe there is a Satan. They use Satan as a representation. This book is not really about a religion, but about one man's bitter opinion on the world and its religions."
5,Satanism=Christianity,"I have read this book. LA Vey attempts to show satanism as a philosophy, which is completely inaccurate. PAGANISM is the true philosophical religion. Infact, Christians modeled their 'Satan' after the Pagan religion. By practicing satanism, you are also practicing christianity--because satanism is a part of christians' beliefs, they accept the fact that an immmortal sadist exists. Do not confuse satanism and paganism; Paganism is a nature-worship religion and is ultimately non-sadistic. Satanism is a religion which is completely sadistic and sacraficial. If you are non-sadistic, worship nature and call yourself a 'satanist,' you are *NOT* a Satanist...you are a PAGAN.-D.G. Wells, Ph.D, Theologist"
5,best ever,"I use this once or twice a day. doesn't sting, doesn't leave you feeling sticky and it works! i refuse to live without it."
4,Smells devine.,"I love the scent of this witch hazel, and so far it isn't making my face break out, like witch hazel with alcohol does."
2,Asperger Syndrome?,"This is a very personal story of a family dealing with the struggles of a teen/young adult who does not quite fit the definition of ""normal"". For any family dealing with this in their lives, this book is a good read. However, the descriptions of the teen in the book did not lead me to believe that he has Asperger Syndrome. This is somewhat addressed in the book in the early chapters while the parents were trying to find an appropriate label for their child. If your looking for something specific to Asperger Syndrome, I would look elsewhere. If, however, you would like to share in the experiences of a family who struggle and want the best for their child, this is a good read."
3,Fits Well but...,"I just bought this cover for my pearl and it fits very well. All the buttons are accessible. However, the quality of the skin has a smooth rubber feeling and is not that great. It attracts A LOT of dust, dirt, etc. In a couple of hours it went from looking new to pretty dirty. It may provide the protection for the pearl but so far it looks to make it less attractive because of the material of the cover."
3,Holes do not line up,This wrap fits my BlackBerry 8100 Pearl just fine but the holes on the side do not line up as they should. Otherwise it is fine.
3,Under-evaluated Japanese pop stars,"Since too much time I got sick of Western popular music, so I enjoy looking for new sounds around the world. And Sophia are certainly one of my favourite Japanese rock bands.This new CD (the second one in their five-years career) contains a part of the singles they published before that, plus new songs. All the album is full of cheerful sounds and ironic and funny lyrics. Especially I recommend the following songs ""OAR"" and ""Walk"" to hear at."
5,GOOD SHOW,"This may be better than the studio session Freddie and Harold Land did- BORN TO BE BLUE- right around the same time. The congo player from the studio session doesn't show up, and they repeat two of the tunes live. Billy Childs still leads the rhythm section on keyboards. Harold's solos are berift of his usual cliques as he tightens it up and plays normal sideman tenor."
5,Sea green quilt,Our old quilt - exactly the same as the new one - was tattered. It was nice to be able to find a replacement.
3,A good mystery,The book was good. I liked the characters and the good they tried to do for their neighborhood.
5,WOW!!!!,"Todd Crow provides a bravura recording of the Liszt piano transcription of Berlioz' ""Symphonie Fantastique"". Hard to believe that only one pianist is playing! If you love this Berlioz masterwork in it's orchestral version, you'll be blown away by this CD. Todd Crow is a virtuoso pianist and brings out every nuance of Berlioz' incredible score. There are other piano versions available, but this one is tops. Grab it and enjoy!"
2,TOO MANY NAMES!!,"Believe it or not, we found this book actually had too many names. It sounds bizarre but it's true."
5,"Music for working, dreaming, relaxing, loving, getting away","I have many CD's, of many genres, but this is one of the few I can listen to over and over. It immediately resets my mood with the very first title track. I first heard it in a lovely, old restored mansion in Duluth, now a B&B. It set such a wonderful mood for exploring the richness of the past, it became a must have - I only wish Jim Wilson had more CDs. There is great variety and yet not a single track that destroys the mood laid down by the first track. Exquisite!"
1,Not worth the money,I bought this for my 20yr old son and believe me if I had my way I'd send it back. Very poor reception and he can hardly use it. I paid $83.00 for nothing.
4,Hand Held Cobra CB RAdio,Has been good for me. Enjoyed it very much. Serves the purpose I needd it for.
2,Not much range,"I am a little disappointed in the range these cover. I use it with a magnetic roof top antenna, and sometimes have problems talking on it just a couple of blocks away."
5,Furious Beauty,"This is an AMAZING cd. Garmarna fuse sonic noise with quiet Swedish folksong in a way I would not have imagined possible. The fusion of techno and folk often seems to lack emotion, often merely adding an akward beat to a folk tune or a traditional element to a techno track. Garmarna has joined them seemlessly and created music that is furious in its emotion. The songs are often dark and the swirling combination of keyboards, fiddle and distorted guitar sounds like a dark Wagnerian rave. The title track hits hard. The vocals are quiet and gentle amid the turgid chaos of the band. Imagine Enya singing a duet with Rage Against the Machine, but a million times better. This is absolutely wonderful and innovative stuff. Truly a masterpiece."
5,This is why I explore world music,"Who cares if you can't speak Swedish? You'll have no trouble feeling the ancient stories and deep emotional resonance of this exceptional, splendid, wonderful CD. I'm an unabashed fan.From the heart-pounding opening track to the off-kilter rhythms of ""Stomped Bread"" to the lushly evocative tone of ""Herr Holkin"", ""Vengeance"" presents a beautifully rounded portrait by musicians who successfully bridge some of the oldest poetry around (including a stop in the 11th century to scoop up Hildegard von Bingen's spare verse) with modern instrumentation. This is not easy listening music, by any means. The drums are tribal, the rhythms industrial, and the direct, clear voice of Emma Hardelin drives all of it with a beauty that is fierce, but never harsh. Please make room in your collection for this CD!"
3,Poor copy of good show,"I enjoyed the movie, particularly the songs; however, this DVD from Passion Productions is very poor quality. Pictures are not clear; the sound is low; and at times there are skips in the sound track. Amazon refunded my money. Would be happy to have a good version, if it's available."
3,"a fascinating artifact but PLEEEEEZ find a restorer, ok?","forget the surrounding story with ronald reagan (what a maroon!). the reason to see this is the recreations of the actual army show which toured the united states in the early days after americas entry into ww2. what might strike us today as a combo of vaudeville and burlesque was from all ive ever read a great show, and its corn factor is part of its charm. plus, of course, theres the sequence of corporal irving berlin singing ""oh how i hate to get up in the morning"" much as he had 25 years before. that said, the quality of the print on this dvd is godawful! i only hope that this is not the only negative, as a major restoration needs to be done of this important historical record."
1,Poor Quality Picture,The picture on the cover of this DVD gave us the impression that the quality would be better than it turned out to be. This was extremely disappointing!
5,this is the army,"Well, know wonder we won the war with songs like "" This Time "", and ""Head in the clouds "". Sgt Robt Shanley is the most underated singer, and in this he does a great job.What can you say about Kate Smith and God Bless America, one of the all time greats.If you have at least one patriotic bone in your body then this cd is a must have. I have listened to this cd many times and it still gives me goosebumbs every time I here it. Personally I miss the Irving berlins, and the George M. Cohans. The greatest music ever written. Phil James"
2,hate it,this phone is really bad as a WALL phone. the hand set BARELY stays on. its not secure at all. a strong breeze will knock the hand set over. but its good for a desk top because u wont have that issue. the phone sounds clear.
2,?????,"This was advertised as 18/8 stainless steel but when it arrived, the package was marked 18/0 stainless..."
3,Age Has Been kind,"The years haven't been kind to STAGECOACH, and it has little to do with the fact that so many westerns borrowed from it. The expository dialogue and character set-ups are ponderous, and they were ponderous from the beginning. And John Wayne was simply unable to impart much depth to his character, he was still doing b-westerns and it wouldn't be until THEY WERE EXPENDABLE, RED RIVER and SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON that he'd begin to show some acting chops. What remains wonderful is John Ford's panoramic sweep, Yakima Canutt's stunt work and the rich score. Compare this to William Wyler's THE WESTERNER, a mere year later, to see how one film has aged beautifully (THE WESTERNER) and one hasn't. Of course, John Ford is a darling of the auteurist cult, and William Wyler isn't, so STAGECOACH is still heralded as classic. Incidentally, why didn't the Indians just shoot the horses pulling the stagecoach? End of chase, end of passengers ... hmmmmm."
1,Criterion Movies have no closed captioning!,Mostly old people want to watch old movies. It is a crime to put out new releases without closed captioning!
3,"Great plot, poor characters.","I loved the overall plot of this book, but felt that the flimsy characters dragged the book down. I spent the entire story trying to figure out the ""mystery"" and that is what drove me to finish it. I was moderately rewarded at the end of the novel with the typical ""there'll be a sequel"" ending.The characters are what killed this book. Brianna, the ""damsel in distress"" was rude, abrasive and spoiled to the point of being irrational. I didn't want to see her saved at all.Tavis, the main character, irked me because he was doing everything he could to save a character who wasn't worth saving.The verbal and emotional interaction between characters was forced and stilted at best. Dialogue was campy when the characters were discussing feelings and thoughts.Overall, I won't be picking up the second of the series."
2,Sad To See The End Has Come For This Group,"BTW Im 34 and haved lived through alot of the 80's rock and metal scene. And Ratt and Crue was some of my favs.But then it seems like the ""GRUNGE"" came along and took all of that away.But back to my review. I will say that for me this was the last attempt for a comeback for the band even though some of the key members are missing that made up alot of Ratts sound.As for Pearcy's other groups ""Arcade"" thier first release was the only good one. Im not even going to say what my views are on his solo project.It makes me sick to see someone make a mockery of the songs that was remembered by all us ""Old School Rockers"" and i think he should just hang up preforming and maybe go into produceing."
2,I can't hold back,"I am trying very hard to find the original album title I can't hold back ( i think this is the title)to no avail. This album has white line, misery train,can't hold back etc. I am not sure I like the concert classics vol. version. Can anyone help me ?"
3,"If your a reader, buy the book!","As a lawyer and someone who read the book before seeing the movie, I highly recommend that you buy the book rather than this movie. While the movie does somewhat accurately depict what happened, it really minimizes the serious and close relationships that Jan Schl..(travolta's character)developed with his clients, and also barely gets into how much time Jan spent researching and developing this case."
4,A Mother's Love,"I fell in love with Miranda Otto in Danny Deck Chair and will watch her in anything.This movie was, at times, a little all over the place, but definitely worth watching for all of the performances, especially Otto's and the child actors.Otto gives a gripping peformance as a mother willing to do anything to save her child's life, even when no one else believes what she's doing is right.Lothaire Bluteau as Aleksi is terrific in a fairly brief, but important role.The film touches on ideas of faith versus science, but doesn't explore them fully. Still, there are highly charged performances from everyone involved and The Healer is a highly watchable film."
3,candlelight piano,I should have listened -if I could to selections from this disc. It was not what I wanted - I had heard a selection from evidently another disc of Doys- this was not the one!
4,It was a good buy!,"Doy is an excellent pianist. Unfortunately, he has a ways to go toequal Roger Williams or even Richard Clayderman which I thought he might when I heard the first piece on the album! But, after I received the disc and played it through, I still felt he is excellent but not yet in their class!!"
3,Not as easy to use as you hope.,"Either you know exactly what you are getting, in which case grab these, they're fine, or you think you can save money framing at home....good luck"
2,certainly not memorable,"I watched this movie three weekends ago, and already I can't remember much of anything about it. I guess that about sums it up."
1,"""Do It"" packing tape","I purchased a roll of ""Do it"" packing tape and it's the most awful tape I've ever used. It's extremely thin, tears easily and I actually have the roll coming up and over the top of the tape cutter in order to use it. Frugal person that I am, I am determined to use it up and I can't wait for that to happen. I'll be more careful the next time I purchase packing tape to check what brand it is. I do not recommend this tape at all."
5,Ernie Ball Fraiiling Strings,I bought a used banjo that had very old rusty strings. Replaced them with the Ernie Ball 2061 Earthwood Frailing Strings. Very nice sounding and easy to play. I'm very pleased!
1,Price,Why does Amazon have this at such a high price? I paid $20.00 two years ago for the same thing.
4,Great gizmo to have!,"I work for a company where our field technicians constantly have to transfer data from one place to another. They no longer have to carry portable zip drives or hope that there's a CD burner somewhere for them to copy data. With this JumpDrive, transferring and copying data is a cinch!!"
3,Solid Power Metal,"""Sons of society"" is in the same musical vein as Riot's ""Inishmore"" and ""Through the storm"" - It's so called Power Metal. The music is usually fast and well performed with great vocals, melodic arrangements and good guitar playing. Even `tho it's good, it would be better if Riot would go for a little more variation in their material (and not only on this release...).I have said it before and I'll say it again - if you like this type of heavy metal you should absolutely get Pretty Maids' ""Red, hot and heavy"", and why not Rondinelli's ""Our cross, our sins"", and Dario Mollo/Tony Martin ""The cage II"". This is what metal should be about!"
3,"Hurried, choppy and sketchy","There seems to be a fly-over tone and quality to this book. It lacks flow and cohesion. The photo quality is indeed poor. Lucas also mis-cites Henry Fairfield Osborn's theorizing -- the citation should be to Osborn's article in Science (April 13, 1900), particularly at p. 567, not his later 1910 book publication. As to recounting the Central Asiatic Expeditions, the treatment is uneven and somewhat speculative. Also, some spellings are inconsistent: eg., ""Granter"" (caption Figure 2-10) vs. ""Granger"" (text, p. 24), and neither is found in the Index; ""William Morris"" (p. 24) actually was ""Frederick B. Morris,"" and, again, neither is found in the Index; the expedition sequence on p. 24 is muddled (incorrect use of ""First,"" ""Second,"" etc.) and also ignores those made in China beginning in 1921; and etc."
3,Disappointing quality,"I have been a collector of Chinese fossils for several years and was interested in purchasing a book on the subject. This book is very informative, but the pictures are of such low quality that some of them cannot even be made out. In other cases, the fossil specimen is described with no photograph or drawing at all. All in all, this book is not worth the money for those who enjoy collecting and understanding Chinese fossils."
3,Not goth-punk band Bauhaus,"Bauhaus ""Stairway to Escher"" was recorded in 1974 in Rome. It is a completely different band then the goth-punk band Bauhaus, which was formed in 1978. This ""Stairway to Escher"" is a live recording of the Italian jazz-rock band Bauhaus. Just so you know.. The page, I thought, was a bit misleading since it provided a link to the Bauhaus goth-punk store, which honestly has nothing to do with the album ""Stairway to Escher""."
4,great for ideas,"i actually like this book, but i expected more info in canning. i mean actual cannning recipes not just recipes.....not sure if i am making myself clear but i did expect a simpler way of explaining and more recipes. but still good and informative."
3,Anne,Is helps me a little more in the art of preserving. I am sure it will come in handy next summer.
5,Excellent!,We purchased this dvd to complete our K9 collection. The movie is really goodand we received it very quickly after ordering!
4,Brant,"This is a great book all the suspense you could want.SHE must be obeyed,a classic with all the mystery, There have been several movies made about this book you will want to read."
5,still one of my favorites,I have seen many animation movies and series. this is still one of my favorites. Do not hesitate to buy.
2,Count me out,"Well, I like fantasy, and I love cats, and I still think that the premise of this book sounds creative and rather clever. But when I tried to actually read the book, I couldn't get past the first chapter. It just didn't hook me. Something seemed off.I put it aside for a month and then tried again. This time I got past the first chapter, but barely.So I gave it to my sister, because she likes cats as much as I do, and is even more of a fantasy fan. She couldn't get into it either. Perhaps it's genetic."
1,Terrible,"I purchased this book because I was under the impression it would be similar to ""The Ghatti's Tale"". This book was very hard to read and I didn't even finish it. It jumped around and didn't seem to have any point. Not only did I buy this book that was such a disappointment, I also bought the second book and now I have two books that I won't read and wasted my money on. While I did not read the second book, I have no doubt it is as bad as the first."
5,A beautiful book,"It was a beautiful book, yet sad and realistic. The characters all had well written, with pasts. Gabriel King took alot of time to give each character personalities an pasts. A good plot, an open ending."
5,My favorite book,"I read this book about a year ago, but I still love it. After reading nothing but horrible required books in school for about a month, I really feel like reading this again. Unlike some books I've read this is a real page-turner. I couldn't put it down the first or second time I read it. The Golden Cat, the sequel was just as good (if not better). Contrary to what other people have said about this book, the author developed the characters well without rambling, which is almost impossible for most authors to do. I give this book 4 paws up. It may not be 50 years old and written by a recluse, but it's definitely a classic in my opinion."
1,Excuse me while I cough up a hairball,"I am a cat lover and a lover of good fiction. This book fails to do justice to either subject. King gives us no reason to care about his flat, uninvolving and derivative characters. There is nothing new in this so-called tale and it appears King felt compelled to repeatedly reach for a thesaurus to pad out the gruel-thin narrative. No discernable threat or villain is made clear within the first few chapters. If the so-called protagonists's mission is ever explained, it must be past the first few chapters I managed to wade through. Tell us who the ""King and Queen"" are and why they are so important, for instance. Nothing any of the characters do within the first 60 pages shows any sign of backbone or heart, nor compelled me to care. Comparisons to Richard Adams or Paul Gallico here are just plain pompous. The author earns one star for finding someone willing to publish this tedious morass."
2,Not for young kids,"I purchased this book for my daughter who is a lover of all things Cat! The book was supposed to be for the nine to twelve age range (my daughter is nine and an advanced reader) so I felt it would be a good choice based on many positive reviews. However, about a quarter the way through the book, my daughter brought it to me and said she was uncomfortable reading any further because a cat was going to be raped! I assumed she was incorrect, but after reading the page she was at, there was indeed a potential cat-on-cat rape scene being set up. Although the character does not actually get raped, the word ""rape"" is used, and I don't feel this is the most appropriate subject matter for a little girl. This may very well be a great book, but parents of younger readers should be aware that there is some fairly heavy subject matter in this story."
2,Shower with more than one sprayer,"After a few months of owning it I found that it breaks easily along the line. I know get a full body shower, which is great, except, I don't want one this way. If you never remove it from its hanger, then its ok."
1,Not worth the money,"This book is more of a reference guide of compiled thoughts. it follows the DRII practices pretty closely. I remember it was VERY expensive, it should be priced around $15, if that is what you are paying then it's OK. My apologies to the authors but it is not a well written book. The only reason it sells is that there is very little about business continuity planning. Save your money and go take a BCP course someplace or attend a conference instead, you'll get a lot more out of it."
5,wholistic approach - VERY GOOD!,"This book is comprehensive and covers all the bases. No matter the size of your organizatrion, this book will give you solid guidelines and examples of starting a Business Continuity Program, managing it and performing all the other functions needed to help protect your company in the event of any sort of disruption or disaster."
1,"BETTE DAVIS, ONE LAST TIME, THAT'S ALL!","This film is nothing, except for BETTE DAVIS. You get to see her one last time. She's old now and looks weak, but she still SHINES! She steals every scene that she's in. Unfortunately, she's not in very much, she quit the movie after only one week of filming. Once she saw how she looked on film, she was very unhappy and did not want to go on with it, she just walked off the set and never returned. If you are a fan of Bette Davis, i would say, go ahead, buy this film, just to see and have it, because it is her last film and the little bit that she is in it, she still SHINES! After she turns into the cat, though, i would say, turn it off, the movie makes no sense. Just buy it to get to see BETTE DAVIS in her last film!"
5,Protecting your Family,An amazing book. I enjoyed it so much I ordered more and sent them to a few of my friends.
2,Aimless sludge.,"Well, I'm going to be different and say that I loathe this record with a vengeance.It's pretentious, the tunes go nowhere and the guy's technique is nothing to write home about. It's wimpy. It's opaque. It's just flat out boring. Ry Cooder did this stuff much, much better nearly twenty years before with his ""Paris, Texas"" soundtrack.How else can I describe this record? Plodding? Aimless? Bah... it's not worth wasting adjectives on this."
3,Could Be Much Better,"I am a big Firefall fan. I am also spoiled rotten that they are local in the Denver area, and I get to see them regularly in small pubs. Quite often The Little Bear in Evergreen. What kills me is this..... They are the most phenominal band to see live. They jam out on their songs like you can't even imagine! Some of the best gutar solo's I have ever seen come from Jock Bartly. Unfortunately this CD doesn't give the seeker of those jams what they are after. I have even mentioned that to the band after their small venue shows......and they agree there is nothing out there that we all are seeking. Who knows if it will ever come. But!!! See them LIVE ! They are amazing! PLEASE GUYS !! Give us one of those Little Bear or Patrick's Pub shows on a CD..... PLEASE !......... Jim, Pine Colorado"
5,Great composers need great performers,"Chopin is one of the brightest composers for solo piano works. Unfortunately, only a handful of performers are able to do justice to his music, bright, deep and heroic, in contrast with an undeserved reputation of lightness. Berezovski's performance is fascinating from beginning to end. His impeccable technique is only used to enhance the brilliance of these Studies, presumably written after Chopin's encounter with Paganini and only played by virtuosos. When I start playing this CD, I have to listen till the end because this is breathtaking."
5,Good product for the price,"This product seems like a perfect balance between cost, taste, quantity, and protein/nutrient content. I recommend this product to people all the time."
1,Another waste of time,Vincent should have just stayed in retirement since his acting only got worse over time. The story line was worthless and of course there were no decent effects. Don't waste your time unless you're just a big Vincent fan for some crazy reason.
2,Tedious,"This book took forever to get to the point of things. I found that very frustrating. Leah seemed lovely, but like the hero, it was hard to get to know her well."
4,Great bed - excellent value,"I got this bed for my little son. Bed arrived on time wih all parts. Instructions are not difficult, but you will need a second person to put it together. Overall it took me about an hour. Quality of the bed is good. Some parts are solid wood, some are particle board, however for the price is great. Standard toddler mattress fitted without problems and my little kid likes the bed. So far so good."
2,Not as sturdy as I thought,"I bought this bed for my two year old child, when it first came a piece of wood that was to be placed in the middle to set up the bed was found broken. When the bed was finally set up another smaller piece of middle wood was found broken again. I will not advise anyone to buy this bed because if you have a jumping toddler all the wood that makes up the middle compartment will soon be broken. Cute but not sturdy.CR M.D"
5,Very Very Good!!!!,"First I would like to say that I wasn't expecting for this CD to be this good, I said to myself let me listen to it out of curiosity, when I heard the songs I was so impressed how good it was. Jordan did an amazing job on this solid project , the songs touches you ""Broken by you"" ""Seperate ways"" and I could go on and on. This is not you typical pop music album that you hear on the market these days. This is a mixture of R&B,with some great funky songs that has definitely some great style, I got the CD today and I just can't stop play it. Jordan if you ever read this I want to tell this CD is slamming and I wished you success with it. you out there reading this I encourage you to go get it, you won't regret it."
5,you've changed the world!!,"Hey jordan!! This album was one of the best album's of all time!! Can you cool it down a bit. Singers can't sing like you we wouldn't want to make anyone quit the business!! A+(...).!!! Love always, Without you i won't be ""lonely""!! christy."
5,This album is amazing...Jordan proved his talent ONCE again,"My! I had the wonderful opportunity to listen to his album during an in-store. There's not enough words to describe how incredible it is. We have waited his return for 5 years and I must say it's been worth. His album is wonderful. I personally LOVE a different party. Most of the songs have slow tempos but when the boy picks it he rocks the house! All in all, it is a MUST get! You may wanna also check out the remix version of GIVE IT TO YOU"
3,disappointed,"After buying ""Unfinished"" by Jordan Knight, I was excited to see what other albums he did on his own after his departure (turns out it was only temporary) from NKOTB. I was not a NKOTB fan growing up, but their music definitely was a part of every teenager's life in my childhood.I was disappointed with this album. Though Jordan Knight's vocal talents cannot be denied, the music was nothing special. There are a couple of good tracks on it, so I recommend listening to them and just getting the tracks you want. Having said that, I bought this entire CD used for only $3 with shipping and handling, and I can find at least 3 songs I like on it, so I think I got the better deal.I highly recommend ""Unfinished"" by Jordan Knight. THAT is the album that really promotes what Knight can do vocally."
5,Great debut solo album with a funky beat,"I haven't heard a song that has stayed in my head and made me sing it over and over for sooooo long. ""Give it to you"" is a great dance song to listen to in your car while you're driving with your honey."
2,I'm returning for different book on type,"This book seems to give a good history of type, but was hard to read for me. Pages were very busy with lots of sidebars, making it difficult to read, and many good layout examples were small and in black and white. I'm returning this book. If you want one good, easy to read book on type, get Ellen Lupton's ""Thinking with Type."" Less information, but much easier on the eyes to read, concise and clear."
5,A NON-REVIEWER FINALLY SPEAKS,"This is my favorite and perhaps the best Meat Puppets album for this simple reason: It rocks. Not only that, but it rocks in a fun and sexy way (unlike the heavy-handed ""Monsters"" followup disc). Some of the best interactions in rock have occurred in the trio setting, and this disc shows how three guys can cruise to the outer reaches of musical creativity together. There are no weak tracks here, the musical interaction is uncanny, and each of these guys is a virtuoso of groove on these tunes. Curt's guitar fills in particular are awe-inspiring. Supposedly this was a low-key, hasty effort after the ""Mirage"" disc, but you wouldn't guess that from the deft performances and uniformly creative compositions. Yeah, yeah ""MP-2"" is quirkier, and ""Up On The Sun"" is pretty good, but ""Huevos"" kicks tuchas!"
5,Took my breath away!,"This is a truly STUNNING piece of work. It absolutely took my breath away! I'm sure it will do the same for you. The settings are magnificent and various enough that each will hold your fascination for well more than a month. I keep one copy of this calendar in my kitchen and one in my dining room. I also have one tacked to the wall over my bed that I see first of all upon waking. The fecal selections are impeccable, reflecting a fine sense of form and connoiseurship. Kudos!"
4,Love authentic performances,"I like to see the Egyptian bellydancers do authentic bellydance. Its great to compare the difference. Now American bellydancer though to me are so much more perfected in their movements. Also, the facial expression we use are more natural in my opinion, since we dont have to beg people to accept our dance. Interesting documentation."
5,Delicious!,"Oh wow... I have to say that this product is very delicious! I purchased it along with Act II popcorn salt and Wabash Valley Farms popcorn topping... I didnt get the salt or the topping yet, so I tried this with some sea salt....YUMMY! It has a wonderful flavor and I actully doubled what my machine calls for in oil and it definately resembled the base taste of movie popcorn to me...and did I mention it's healthy? WIN WIN for me!"
2,leaves you wondering,I just finished this book and after about the 10th time of hearing about there not being enough girls to match the quota of young men in China I began to wonder if the author was for or against adoption from China. According to her there will be a war breaking out when these boys grow up and have no girls to marry. I really liked the book at first - but the repetition got old and harder to read about midway through.
3,"Adequate, but somewhat disappointing","Adoptive parents of girls from China are so hungry for informationthat they have seized on this book as if it were their Bible. Am I theonly one who found it disappointing? (I have two daughters fromChina.) It's an odd blend of memoir, fact, and speculation that doesnot after all tell us much about these girls' ""missingpast."" I don't need to read afictional account of the feelings that may have gone through mychildren's birthmothers' minds as they left their babies behind; I canconjure that for myself.This book has a place on adoptive parents' bookshelves,but it is *not* the definitive book on adoption from China. That bookhas yet to be written."
5,Excellent Series,"This is a wonderful, brief history told through the perspective of a very insightful writer."
3,Civilisation: The Complete Series (DVD),"The programme is, of course, as good as it ever was. 5 stars.But what's up with the delamination of disk #2. I've purchased 3 sets and returned them all because of this problem. 1 star.Do all the sets have the same problem? Can anyone add to this?"
2,A tad disappointed,"I wanted to like this book. Started it with a lot of anticipation. But was rather disappointed.Somehow the characters of the three strong women - Victory, Wendy and esp. Nico are nice in the beginning. They are strong independent women who are doing well in their careers. Great - we get that. But beyond that, the only thing the book tries to do is preach that women have it tough in the corporate world and that they should stick together and encourage other women.Not too bad but just bland is what I thought this book was. Maybe the series is better."
1,Highly disappointed,"I couldn't wait to read this book what with all the hype surrounding it. It was very promising in the first chapter.......I guess I should have read the first chapter over and over because the rest of the book was terribly boring. Toward the middle of the book I couldn't wait to finish it not because it was so interesting but because it had no substance at all. Given this is chick-lit but the characters were boring and underdeveloped. The story line was ""surface only"" meaning you get a peek at what could be a good read but it falls off without any development. Borrow it from your local library. Don't spend the money on this one."
1,Never Received it,"I ordered this book a month ago, and I still have never received it. I am very disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"For the most part, I found this novel to be lacking in character development and devoid of any significant themes."
1,Terrible. Awful.,"Bushnell parenthetically inserts herself three times in this book to explain various trite phrases this way: ""It was a cliche, but it was true."" This whole book is a cliche. And it might be true. But by the time it's over, you won't care. You'll just be glad to be free of these half-inch-deep characters.Sure, there's the average writing. And the unbelievably obtrusively contrived ""twists"". And the way that you can look across the book to see the ending the way you can look across Texas to the horizon. But mostly I was overcome with feeling very sorry for Bushnell, if ""Trading Up"" and this book represent the way she views people. And I felt horrified for her husband, to whom the book is dedicated, because there's only one male (man or boy) in the book who isn't a cuckold and/or a complete jerk, and that one is a cardboard cutout.That was the last book of hers that I'll ever read."
3,No Sex and the City!,"This is a long, drawn-out book about three very successful women and their struggles to the top. I think Bushnell focuses too much on their messed up relationships and work struggles that the relationships between the three women. I never truly felt the bond that they shared until the last few pages.IT takes place over a year in the lives of Nico, a top New York City editor of the most popular magazine, Wendy, the Head of a huge production company, and Victory, an up and coming designer. All of who are on their way to the very top and this book follows them through the struggle of being a successful woman in NY and the breadwinner of their families.It was a little drawn out and sometimes hard to follow as Bushnell skips from one person to the other and all over the place through out their year....before you know it, it's summer then fall, then winter!"
4,NOT SO MUCH A LOVESTORY AS A STORY OF FRIENDSHIP....,"CANDACE BUSHNELL IS ONE OF THE BEST CONTEMPORARY ROMANCE NOVELISTS OF OUR TIME. THAT SAID, THIS STORY WAS MORE ONE OF FRIENDSHIP THAN OF ROMANCE. THE THREE WOMEN BOND EARLY AND OFTEN. THEY SHARE A LOVE FOR ONE ANOTHER THAT OUTLASTS THEIR THROWAWAY LOVES FOR THEIR SIGNIFIGANT OTHERS. I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE READ MORE ABOUT THEIR FRIENDSHIP THRU THE YEARS, INSTEAD OF THEIR THROWAWAY RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE MEN IN THEIR LIVES."
3,Brain Candy,"This was a fun chic-lit novel. Candace Bushnell created Sex in the City so if you're familiar with the show you have a pretty good idea what this novel is like. Despite it's length, this is a two-day read at most. It's brainless and fun and provided a welcome respite for my overtaxed brain. There's nothing wrong with a little brain candy now and then!"
5,The real stuff,"Caroline Paul is an excellent writer with a riveting first-person tale to tell. I was involved in the 89 earthquake in San Francisco and later interviewed members of the SF Fire Department about the time she was joining its ranks. What she writes rings absolutely true. I don't usually choke up reading books, but she got me four times. The reason I'm writing this review is because I'm back to buy two more copies for friends."
4,And Then There Were None.,"A mesmerizing look at Muslim Spain during the Reconquest, from the perspective of the re-conquered. The disconnect between Ferdinand and Isabella's actual orders and the way they were implemented by the local Spanish Inquisition is fascinating. The idyllic home life of the Muslim village nobility is enchanting. The brutality of the Catholic violence is appalling. And the one-page epilogue is tantalizing. A book to include in any curriculum of wars from the perspective of the attacked...."
3,Gordon Ramsay Cookbook,"This cookbook was just a little over my head. I guess I am not into so much gourmet, not sure I would ever attempt what is in the book."
4,Dinette TV,"This was purchased to replace an old 13"" TV I was using in the dinette. It fits nicely on the counter. I have a raised 24"" cabinet in the center and it fits the width and height nicely. It has a great picture and the audio is ok. I'm happy with it for the price. Amazon was right on time with the two day delivery. This would also make a good TV for a bedroom. Lot's of connections and could easily be hooked up to a surround sound system. Includes an optical audio out. Some reviewers complained about a difficult set up with the menu's. I did not find it particularly difficult. If you can program an old VCR you can handle this."
4,Value for money!,"This is an good product for the price I paid, manny features an settings, works with laptops also flawlessly, good no. of I/O ports.One thing wished was capavnility of taking PAL and SECAM inputs also. THese days lots of ppl travel around the world and TV should take these input type.Picture and sound is good for the 23"". Overall happy with it."
1,"""New' versions of the classics you love. But Best of ARS.","Recently I heard an ARS song on the radio, and I thought, I have to get one of their albums. I found this one.. I popped it into my cd player and was stunned. It was NOT the versions I loved to hear while growing up. It was some lame re-recording of the great ARS songs. However.. it does have some of the original artists.Since these are NOT the songs you probably want to hear, I cannot reccommend this album. If you want to hear the great original recordings, you want to purchase BEST OF ATLANTIC RHYTHM SECTION, (June 11, 1991). FOrtunately, this too is available on Amazon."
2,"Annoying sound, Fun for short periods of time.","This toy makes the most annoying chirping/squeaking penguin sound when turned on. You can't turn the sound off. So it makes the annoyance factor of this toy very high.That aside, this toy consists of three little plastic penguins 'climb' a staircase, then slide down the slide and end up at the stairs again to repeat the process... over and over and over and over again. There are only so many times you can watch this before it gets old. Even kids get bored eventually. Mine has more fun just playing with the penguins separately. I am amazed none have gotten lost yet as they are only 2 inches tall if that.This toy doesn't have much going for it in my book. It isn't educational and it doesn't inspire much creative play, plus the annoying sounds it makes are enough to make one go batty. There isn't much you can do with it. The penguins are cute I guess, but I think you could find a better toy."
4,kids like it,grandkids are 2 & 4...they seem to like it but I cant say too much since we saw them play with it for a few mins. Its just something for them to watch since they dont really do anything with it !
3,Penguin Race,"The kids love the Penguin Race but it has an annoying continious sqeaking sound when it is turned on. I suppose it's meant to mimic the sound of penguins. Either way, I took the toy appart and cut the sound box out. Now everyone in the family can enjoy the toy."
4,squeeky noise,"I got this toy for my son and he loves it! watching the penguins go down the slide is fun.the only thing is that i almost grabbed it and stamped it against the wall due to the annoying squeek sound that makes when you turn it on.. but i followed the steps on one of these reviews and took the pump out (what a relief!) and now its pleasant to turn it on and watch the little penguins go up and down again and again, even the cat likes it now.Overall.. its a nice toy and i will recommend it"
4,Fun for the little ones,This toy caught the imagination of every youngster who saw it and brought giggles and smiles to them. I'm very pleased with it and find them still turning it on after weeks of use. They truly enjoy the penquins.
4,Her Reflection In Chrome,"I'll never forget the day I heard that song. I was on lunch and browsing through the local radio stations. When I heard it I stopped scanning and took a good listen. This song puts you in such a mellow mood. It's something for those who like non-mainstream, alternative. I certainly would recommend this CD."
1,A Suprise,"I read the first volume of the Hazard series and found it very enjoyable. I ordered The Brave Captains and was looking forward to it. I then read a review that panned the book and called it a mess. I thought that was unlikely, given how everything else I had read by Vivian Stuart was first rate and I just put it down as a poor review. I started into The Brave Captains and the review was right - tough slogging. It is a dreary list of dates and brief engagements and who was appointed where and when.I managed to finish it, skipping whole pages. I then read volume 3 and the rest of the series and they are all excellent books. The only bright thing about this book is that it provides a bridge in the series to the next and much better volume 3.Just a word on Vivian Stuart. I have read some references to the author as a female. Vivian was a man's name which has now become mainly a woman's name. Vivian Stuart was a man who wrote from a man's perspective."
2,Looks good for a while. Works fine. But then.,"Well, I ended up sitting on this thing in the box for a year before I installed and used it. Once installed the paint started coming off within a matter of 6 or 7 months. As it stands now, the handle for the water is basically all brass in color.Function wise it works great and I have no complaints as to that. It's simply the finish which has failed to meet any expectations."
5,Amazing,"A classic work of the Quikster. This album shows Quiks work at his roots...the old school funk, yet able to throw in that ""gangsta"" feel along with it. Every track has a catchy tune and clever lyrics. A must have for any true hip hop fan out there."
5,America's most complete artist,"DJ Quik has got to be one of the best DJ's and westcoast hiphop-artists of all time. He does everything by himself. He plays all the instruments, does all the scratches and he is also an MC. Quik is an incredible artist. This album is a perfect example of his work. One of the best ever released. Definetely my biggest inspiration as a DJ. Bottom line."
1,Double-dose of crapola,"No knocks on the two British-era Hitchcock movies-- they're both worth seeing.The issue here is the product itself.MADACY's double-dip gray box VHS series is one to be avoided.Recorded at SLP speed, each VHS contains a smidgen of tape. Transfer quality of stressed film stock is pretty bad, so is tracking, and when you factor in the space wasted by these two-tape sets, it all adds up to junk bin rejects.Not worth it!Best advice to anyone still purchasing videotape: try to locate studio releases or at very least labels that you are certain record at the SP mode."
2,If you really like the color teal....,"Quality of this item is high, without a doubt. However, the balls are a true teal color, so if you're looking for Christmas green, look elsewhere.Also, as a warning: this supply company has the strictest return policy I've ever seen--you literally have 72 hours to return something you don't want or you're stuck with it. I personally think Amazon should print this somewhere to warn people before they buy from them. If you're on vacation and have it delivered, you're out of luck."
2,"Wordy, too little finance","Someone recommended this as a taut financial thriller. Well at over 500 pages it's NOT taut! I realize people reading financial thrillers envy their protagonists (the ""wannabe"" effect), but the portrayal of the protagonist here is annoyingly silly and shallow: keeps gloating about his Ivy education, berating everyone else, travelling the world etc etc etc.As a result the FEW chunks of financial and political plot (the dynamics of distressed debt default in syndicated loans, elasticity of oil with other markets, the details of algorithmic trading by what is known today as VWAP, TWAP etc.) are watered down with too much annoying, long winded, completely inconsequential tripe pertaining to the ""high culture"" of the protagonist. You get the idea. Bleah. The tripe to plot ratio in this book is over 60%. This book could be a ""good"" 200 page read. Instead we are treated to the author's diarrhea."
4,Cheap but get the job done,Standard cheap Chinese product that I dont expect to last but is good for the random fix it/weekend handyman type job. Not something you want if you job depends on it but hey what do you expect for 5 bucks.
5,Both SAE & Metric and Great Quality,Having a full set of nut drivers [handles attached] is expensive and bulky. These are great to keep with a multi-screwdriver that can hold these nut drivers. The holder is great quality also! Something that everyone need a set for home and to keep in their car.
3,Nut Drivers,"I like this item a lot. However, I found out that this item gets rusty after a little while. I don't mind paying double the money IF it was made of stainless steel."
5,Mountain Boy sled,"I ordered the Mountain Boy sled for an adult son who, last winter when it snowed, wished he had a sled. He's difficult to buy gifts for, and this was a huge success. He says it's a ""work of art,"" and can hardly wait for one of Western Washington's infrequent snows to try it out."
5,I just taught this book to a group of 8 kids!,"I teach 5th and 6th grade students. I read this book as a boy, and wanted to introduce it to kids today. This is the 5th or 6th time that I have taught it to a group. The class rated it overall with a 3.9375 out of 5 stars, a bit lower than the average on Amazon. Some kids didn't like the fast pace of the book (interesting), others were not interested in magic. Several, however, rated it either 4 or 5 stars. I would definitely teach it again."
3,This book is good read despite bad ending,"I think this book was good because it painted a picture in the readers mind and it was very descriptive.I think that this book is good except for the last chapter. I did not like the last chapter because it was not as descriptive as some of the other parts of the book like in chapter eight when the author describes Lewis's Aunt Mattie, who is dead."
5,Great!,"this was a sick key chain, cant ask for any better, I will buy from them, they are very countable(:"
1,Pure Dribble,This may be the worse book ever written on handicapping.The author is definitely not a a horse player.Good title for a book that does not live up to the hype.
1,"Creative & entertaining, but big-picture history sacrificed.","If creative entertainment and technical production proficiency are your primary standards for selecting a videotape, try this one. But, if you are seeking a balanced and representative big-picture review of the cultural history of Puritan New England's real-world history, by-pass this one. The most unrepresentative characters receive disproportionate attention; -- the most impacting contributions of mainstream Puritan New England lives, literature, industrial and cultural heroes (e.g., Winthrop, Mather, Bradstreet, Bradford, Adams, cod-fishermen, etc.) are too quickly sacrificed for limelighting the quasi-exotic. The video should be re-named to fit this historical imbalance."
2,Hard to get the light to shine where you want it,"This is a nice concept, but it doesn't work well in practice. The clip doesn't open very wide, and only has a little piece of rubber to help it maintain it's grip. The only thing I can get it to hold onto is a book. That would be okay, except the neck is too short to get it pointed so that the light actually shines on the pages."
3,Decent book light,The book light I received works very well but like other reviewer's stated it is a little too bright. Also it's kind of heavy so you can't clip it to just the front cover or the back cover of a soft cover book so you have to keep un-clipping and re-clipping the book light everytime you need to turn the page but I assume those are common problems when it comes to book lights so overall I would say it's a good book light at a decent price.
1,Does not work!,This was a total waste of money! It doesn't even give out enough light for you to see the book. So it's useless
1,fail....,"This clip light is hopeless....When we got it the batteries were dead, or at least we hope it's just the batteries that are keeping it from working. And to make it worse you have to take the thing completely apart to replace the batteries. Very user UN-friendly."
5,"Bright, Holds up",The clip holds sturdy onto the book. The neck stays put where you want it. The light is bright- great for reading in the dark. Overall happy with the purchase.
1,A Flickering Mess,From day one this light would flicker and only stop when you fiddled around with it. Total waste of money.
4,"Bright, light weight","I love this light. It is bright and focused. The clip is good, and it is very flexable. I wish it took AAA bat and not a button ones."
5,Great small light source,I've been looking for a small flex light like this for some time. Being used next to my LP turntable to see the LPs in low light and get the stylus on the right track. Cool item at a good price.
1,book light review,"The light is very good with this book light; however, mine has quit working, and it isn't 6 months old. I assumed the batteries needed to be replaced, but that didn't work either."
4,Works great,"The light now allows me to read in bed comfortably. It is easy to use and shines a great focused light. It's also rather attractive. It is, however, a bit bigger than I expected it to be."
2,White Mother of Pearl Angel Pendant on Sterling Silver Chain,It was nice and in good shape. Not as large as I felt it should have been according to the picture advertised. The chain was a very thin and I would say cheapened the product. The delivery was prompt and I suppose I got what I paid for.
4,Great end to a great series,"Yes, this book was pretty much the same as the first two installments. Which makes it a pretty darn good book.The problem which keeps this one at 4 stars, was it was just a bit too... long. While the other books, especially the second, had passages that waxed into long descriptions and technical natured discussion (in this book, it is lengthy passages relating to working at a bell foundry) in this novel they were just far too long and far too plentiful.I could have done with a much lesser amount of the dry ""every day working"" bits in this story.They made this book drag a little, where the first two flew by for me.However, the end of the story was all I could have hoped for and more. Not at all predictable, much is explained, and much of it shocked me quite a bit!All in all an excellent series, and quite not what I expected."
4,Really nice,This product is really nice because it has the basic functions used for sport and spare time.And the watch is comfortable (small and with rubber belt).
1,Not worth it,"This was my first purchase of an airsoft gun. The gun seemed fine but i quickly learned that the hop-up feature made it very inaccurate and worse, the sight on the gun fell apart within a week. So i can't really recommend this product. But even more disappointing was the interaction with the seller. They were willing to take the gun back for a replacement but i had to pay return shipping; it took almost a month for them to ship the replacement item and then that item never arrived and they claim it was lost by UPS and they would not ship another gun until they resolved matters with UPS. They simply have no concept of customer service. Thank god for Amazon who are exactly the opposite and have helped me every step of the way. Ended up buying a new gun from a different seller.Update: the missing gun showed up so now i'm stuck with 2 guns because i already bought a replacement... still not happy with their gun quality or service so keeping my one star rating."
2,Publishers who fail to mention,"This is not a review of this book since there already is a review here whether I agree with it or not. However, I would like to bring to anyone's attention who may want to buy this book that this book is merely a reprint of the author's ""An Intelligent Person's Guide to Philosophy"" under a different title. If publishers are going to reprint under a different title, they should make that clear so readers do not buy a book thinking it is different from something they already have."
3,Love in every state...,"WEST VIRGINIA MOUNTAIN MAN...When Kelly McGraw threw open her door one morning, she didn't expect to find tall, virile Dan Marquette.Dan knew Kelly's wily son had seduced his little angel, while Kelly believed Dan's teenage temptress had trapped her perfect boy. But when both parents realized that their children had fallen in love, they were helpless to change the course of nature.Then a quirk of fate brought Kelly and Dan together amid the wondrous backdrop of West Virginia, discovering what their children had already found. But could they keep the power of love all in the family?"
3,It's just ok,"I didn't know Michael's carry stretcher bars so I ordered this. After I received this and went and bought more at Michael's and found out the one at Michael's store is much better quality. Not all Michael's are carry the stretcher so if you can find one at near your house, it's much better to go with that then this. Plus it's much cheaper at Michael's too, you don't have to pay for shipping cost."
4,Nice disc,I'm not a fan of pop culture Christmas music. To me this is how Christmas music should be. A nice disc.
4,One of the Classic Gospel groups,Wonderful stuff but give a pre-purchase listen to find out if it's your cup of tea.
3,MRF-100 Base Station,"As promised, the unit was easy to install and worked well, until it went South. The unit started changing channels and other functions on it's own. Tech Support responded in a timely manner stating that the unit was experiencing RF interference and needed to be moved around until I found a spot that worked well. I have yet to find that spot. I live 10 miles from the nearest town and a mile from the nearest corner. I'm not sure where the RF interference would come from.When it works, it works well. The sporatic changing of functions are becoming farther apart. Maybe it will fix itself."
1,Save your money,The plot is ridiculous. And the writing appears to be done by a teenager. This book did not make any sense. I kept reading hoping it would get better. It didn't. I skimmed most of it just to get through it.
5,Great!,This book was just exciting and fun. You feel like you have just traveled in time and are right there. Great read!
5,A sure hit fest!,"After hearing an advance release of this CD, I can hardly wait to own the album. Don't be fooled by the cowboy title -- this is not your daddy's country music but an amazing fusion of Latin/Cubano riffs and rhythms with some of the best dance rock tunes in American music."
1,If there were less than 5 stars that is what I would rate this.....,This stuff is horrible. I have to cover my face while using it and still taste it for like a half-hour after I use it. People who weren't in the room when I used it and come in after can even smell and taste it. Not worth it.
1,CAUTION - HORRIBLE SMELL & TASTE,"These cans contain a bittering agent in them that you will breath in and be able to smell and taste for 20 minutes after use! I initially thought that the can of air was 'bad' or something had gone wrong during its making, but after reading the front label 3M has put a bittering agent in it to prevent huffing. When I called the 3M hotline they said not to shake or tip the can at all and the agent would not come out. They also said that you should keep 'dairy' products on hand in case the smell/taste bothers you. WHAT???? Seriously? Some areas where dust resides requires you to tip the can and I can't keep 'dairy' in my office fridge. This product is a good idea, but it punishes people who aren't intending to use it incorrectly. I'd recommend you buy another dust remover without the agent, because its a lot of money to spend to punish yourself with the smell!!!"
3,What a life!,"Charlotte Charke led an amazing life in eighteenth-century England. Often in debt, cast out by much of her comfortably-off family, partly for her habit of wearing men's clothes, she tried her hand at inn keeping, pie making, doctoring, waiting at table, gentleman's gentleman, and most successfully (tho that's not saying much) as a strolling player. Her words tumble out just like someone speaking, she doesn't always stick to the point but she brings her times and surroundings vividly to life as she junkets about the country with Mrs Brown, her Friend, living from hand to mouth."
2,Are you serious?,"This ""comeback"" album by Bo Diddley was a big disappointment. They tried to update Bo's sound, so the album ended up sounding nothing like a Bo Diddley album. That wouldn't be so bad if it was actually a good album, but it's not. A must to avoid."
2,"Nice, until it broke","At first glance I'd give this 4 Stars, and the chain was very nice too. All in all it is a lovely piece but all that goes for naught if it isnt durable enough to be worn. My Girl friend wore hers for a matter of days and the chain separated from the pendant (no, the chain did not snap, the ring thats attached to the pendant actualy came apart, almost like it wasn't ""soldered"" on properly. Either way, I can't imagine how to fix it myself and with no where to attach a chain on the one side, its basicly usless. Thus, 2 stars."
4,"A ""Rosie"" Christmas Indeed","The voice of Christmas is indeed alive with this warm and wonderful CD. True, Rosemary Clooney was far past her prime as a vocalist by the time she recorded this album, yet her performances remain sparklingly bright and resonant in the true tradition of smoky jazz trilling."
1,would not buy again,"Found the face scratched very easily but EVEN MORE ANNOYING was the buttons are abit to sensitive. I find the useage of them not intuitive at all, and more often then not I look down to check the time and find I am in lap mode or some other screen."
3,Cheaper at Walmart.com,"I know there is no price match, but Walmart.com is advertising the same watch for under $40."
2,How Many Times Are They Going To Sell Me The Same Material??,"Once again the Jimi Hendrix legacy has been tarnished. This CD features one previously unreleased song. All the others have been either released on the latest box set titled ""The Jimi Hendrix Experience"" or the Reprise and Polydor reissues of the late 80's and early 90's. All of these EXACT songs have been previously released on LP, cassette and CD except for ""Foxey Lady"". If memory serves correctly, the song was acually released on the ""Rainbow Bridge"" DVD making this release 100% exploitation. Also note that most copies come packaged with a sticker stating ""As Seen On TV""! I do give it 2 stars for sound quality and layout. If you have the Reprise and Polydor editions coupled with the latest box set you are simply wasting your money unless you are a completest such as myself."
5,Willie Nelson's Pretty Paper Christmas Album,"This CD is my favorite Christmas CD. Along with the title song, there are nice traditional songs. Worth every penny and a small price."
2,Segovia was right,Andrés Segovia was right when he told Mr. Shearer that his books were useless. I already read part one and I feel like I haven't started yet.
4,Good tactics book,"Tactics books are necessary to read if you want to improve. Its my belief what you are looking for is something that covers a broad range of typical motifs and a lot of problems that aren't to difficult. What we are looking for in a tactics book is drilling into your brain standard patterns so you can see tactics just on your move but at the end of a series of forced moves. I've lost and won many games because a series of exchanges that started off looking safe ended up bad because that rook actually couldn't retake because if it left the back rank it was mate.This book gives a good coverage of typical tactical situations, and clear explanations. Despite the book saying its for intermediate to advanced - I would say its for beginning to intermediate players. A good book for anyone of this level who wants to sharpen their tactical ability."
5,Xmas Present,"I bought this as a gift for the lady this last Xmas. It installed easily (though the chains that came with it were PATHETICALLY short. I bought some longer ones at the local HW store) and sits nice and level. The only real complaint I have other than the chains is that it's nowhere near as black as the pictures indicate. Still, it looks nice and does the job, and easily carries 100s of pounds in cast iron and assorted pots/pans with ease."
2,I'm online looking for a replacement!,"I bought this item about 10 days ago. I like the look of it and the feel in my hand. However, the first time I dropped it, the side of it shattered into glass-like shards. It also comes with holes in it that trap water inside, and mine never drained or dried properly (until it was broken.)I'm looking for the replacement. I think this is the item I had and loved until I left it in a hotel. It's ugly, but it works the best of anything I've ever tried:Marvy Shampoo Brush"
3,digital on the go.,"small, compact, cute, puts your favorite songs from cd's and cassettes, that i have alot of. great for traveling. easy to use. well made product. cool blue screen. all around good product."
4,"good product, with difficult menus","The RipFlash is a good product with a confusing interface.pros:* standard interfaces- native MP3 support- Flash memory- Smart Media Card expansion- USB- standard jacks for ear phone & line-in* good sound quality with the built-in microphone,especially for meetings/interviews* simple (very basic) softwarecons:* AAA batteries- I use rechargables and I wish this devicehad a recharging/docking station like my Palm.* confusing menus (see below)* poor documentationFor the most part, this is a very good device, but the menus are difficult to understand and navigate. The font is the worst device font I've seen in years. But if you can struggle through its basic operation, then you've got a pretty useful device.I do hope they have a ROM upgrade that fixes some of these UI issues and new manual would help too.I would buy this product for someone who's resourceful, but not for someone who needs something very simple to use."
4,Good device,"The ripflash is a good device. you get two gadgets for the price of one. It is a Descent MP3 Player and a very good recorder. I was able to make clear 192kbps recordings right out of the box. The MP3 software was easy and simple to use, just click on the song you want and upload. The only complaints I do have is, the MP3 options. There is no mute option or a pause option (maybe I didn't figure it out yet, just got it) also the Menu display is poor, it doesn't tell you the name of the song just the lenght and track number, but these minor issues aside this is a very good device. I would recommend this to everyone."
2,finicky and unreliable,"Having owned one for several months, I can't recommend it. I use it as a recorder, mostly with a line-in jack from a telephone. The audio volume on playback is low (and yes, I do have it turned all the way up!). The software for transfering files to PCs is clunky - a real Windows 3.1 feel about it.Worst however is that if the battery runs down while recording, it will trash not only the file you have been recording, but every other file. Even with recharged batteries, the unit is completely unuseable until it's been reformatted. There is a battery indicator, but it doesn't give you very much advance warning. The 10 hours playback time may or may not be accurate, but it certainly does not translate to anything like 10 hours of recording time."
1,Beyond Falling to Sleep,i saw the first 10 min and i felt sleephow can anyone act like that ???nothing i can say1 star is a way too much for it
3,1 star movie - 5 star commentary,"I would encourage you to rent this movie, but watch it with the commentary. The commentary by the film makers is hilarious! The movie commentary transformed what could have been a waste of time for the evening into a fun and quite enjoyable affair. The film makers definitely have a sense of humor about their work (and more than one vodka while creating the commentary, I suspect) so you get uninhibited flowing humorous commentary throughout the whole thing. Plus, it did increase my empathy for low budget film makers and the problems they face.1 star movie -- 5 star commentary -- I'll give it a 3 star for average. Definitely fun and enjoyable to watch with commentary."
5,terrible acting...but no worse than twilight,Ok this movie's acting is bad but I find this movie amazing. I am a major b movie fan and this was seriously under budget. The gore wasn't good but if u have a twisted mind like mine the plot makes thorough sense. I will say unlike a lot of the decent reviews I am not a HPL reader never had the privilege. This however is a good movie held together with crazy editing and bad acting. The bad acting I think makes the movie it makes u kinda question sanity which sounds dumb but if you like b rated movies watch it and if you like it good for you. Oh and btw I hate twilight I find it's acting worse.
1,A complete rancid disaster!,"From Savini's stilted cameo, to the amatuer special make-up effects, to the bad early 80's style video effects, this ""film"" is a complete waste of time.While I fully understand all beginning film-makers need to start somewhere, and that most of their first attempts are painfully bad, this one really takes the cake!To say this was LOOSELY based on a HP Lovecraft, is an understatement. Sadly, there are extremely few films that stay true to Lovecraft's writings. And, this one is a prime example. It starts out with a few incoherant murmurs of the original story, then quickly devolves into a mess of self-agrandizing scene-chewing.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!! It has next to nothing to do with Lovecraft, except the title. Even if you are a complete masochist and JUST HAVE TO SEE IT, sucker the local village idiot to rent it for you. DO NOT BUY IT."
1,Watchable?,"Horrible acting and an attempt to shock us with bad camera work leaves us wondering if there was a budget to this. Even Ed Wood would have passed this one up. H. P. Lovecraft's work would be hard to capture on film, but this doesn't qualify."
5,Great shape!,"The movie came in earlier than expected and was in great shape. The movie itself was a little hard to understand, but anyone who loves things out of the ordinary would find it interesting."
5,Fun no matter how many times they make you read it!,"This book was a delightful surprise of a gift for us. You know how you get really tired of reading that same favorite book that your liitle monkeys want to hear, over and over and over...Well, we are NOT sick of this one! They love the interactive approach in which they are encouraged to yell back at the pigeon. They feel good about it, because they are doing what the bus driver asked them to do. We love it, the 3 and 4 year olds, as well as the parents! Thank you MO!"
4,As a teacher . . .,"I love this book. I read it to every young child I can. Everytime without fail the child becomes engaged in the dialouge. They howl and scream and promise that they will not let the pigeon drive the bus. Mo Williams has created a wonderfully precocious main character that has a good solid handle on five-year-old logic. I also loved the firm teaching that ""no"" is an important word to know."
2,Not crazy about the behavior in the book for my toddler,"Not sure that this books is a great example of behavior I want my toddler emulating, it seemed like reading a book about a bird throwing a temper tantrum. . . maybe we're still a bit young at almost 2, I think we'll put it up till my child is a bit older."
1,NOT for littlest ones,"Everyone (or nearly everyone) seems to love this book. So, we tried it - and had a visceral negative reaction. We read to our daughter every day. I try hard to stop what I am doing and read to her when she comes toddling up with a book in her hands. For the sake of sanity, we've experimented with picture books, particularly rhyming picture books, but really anything with very brief text so we don't go completely mad with repetition. This is NOT behavior we wanted to introduce to our toddler daughter. That said, when she's older and able to understand that the pigeon's behavior is not to be emulated, we might give this another try. maybe."
3,Review for spongebob colgate toothpaste for kids,"I used this product for my kids aged 5 and 2 years old. The paste was ok, but I found Kids crest better than this product."
5,Wonderful! My boys love it!,"My sons are 2 and 4 and this is one of their favorite books. It discusses so much that is mysterious to kids, and in an entertaining way. One of their favorite parts is the see-through page section. This section illustrates many body systems: the muscles, the nervous system, the circulatory system. The reproductive organs may not be shown, but how babies are conceived is handled in a very thoughtful way. My boys love to talk about how they were once inside of me!"
2,"Great on the outside, deficient on the inside!","Beautifully crafted leather, but the comments are too simplistic and vague. The commentators seem inept at explaining things in depth. Not a good study Bible at all. Get the NIV version!"
1,Buena traduccion pero manipulación en comentarios y subtitulos,"Los comentarios y subtitulo en cada capitulo desvían la interpretación del lector a las creencias de los editores y comentaristas que demuestran poca investigación y estudio en pleno Siglo 21 donde la información esta a la mano.Pareciera que las explicaciones son sesgadas, se debe tener cuidado porque una equivocada interpretación de la Palabra de Dios podría destruir al mundo (recuerdan las matanzas de las Cruzadas, la ""santa"" inquisición?). También Hitler manipulo la fe de los hombres, proclamo el antisemitismo, el odio al prójimo, a Israel y los judíos(hermanos de Jesús de Nazaret).Recomiendo que busque una biblia que contenga 100% la Palabra de Dios y no palabra de hombres. Busque fuentes limpias de sabiduría en la propia raíz de la fe."
4,"Same bag, cheaper price.","This is the same model sold in the camera dept. It's just sold at a cheaper price in Health and Beauty. I can't explain it, but order this one and not the other! A good bag, too."
3,Judaism and Christianity: the Differences,Enlightening book about the differences between Judaism and Christianity and why the jews do not accept Christ.
2,Had to modify one of the mounting holes,"I had to modify one of the 3 mounting holes because bolt would not go through it. I used a round file to enlarge one of the holes. Maybe 1/16"" bigger on one side of the holes. If you want a drop-in replacement, look elsewhere. Of course, no big deal in enlargening a hole, but I didn't bring my file set with me to my friends house (where I was doing the repair). It was a shorter drive to buy a file from O'Reillys rather than driving all the way back home."
5,"Haunting, Beautiful and Just Perfect...","Where do I start? This cd is arguably on of the best instrumentals I have ever heard, each track is wonderfully arranged; harmonising the piano and cello flawlessly. Mehdi has definitely created a masterpiece. Each track flows to the next like a changing season. I especially like listening to it in the car, when the traffic gets hectic I throw it on and feels the stress melt away. If you like music that creates an image in your mind's eye, then this is the cd for you."
3,For girls only.,"I thought this would be a cool anime, but in the end it was way too girly for me. It seems like the same old events happen over and over again through each episode. I sold this back on amazon right after i watched it."
2,OK,I like the workout part of the dvd. Donna Richardson does a good job with working you out. It is a little difficult if you have not taken any prior dance instruction. The company that is putting out this dvd has produced a poor quality item. The volume continuously goes up and down. Other than that it gives you a pretty good workout.
2,Just ok,I am used to Leslie Sansone who keeps your heart rate up with simple easy to follow steps. This video has better music than Sansones' but the stopping and starting was bugging me.Not for me.
2,Star In Wachovia by Charles Crossfield Ware,I bought Star In Wachovia from the Friends of the Northboro Library and they wanted me to comment on it after I received it. I really wanted the book becasue it was from an area that I live in but when I got it some of the pictures had been cut out and those pictures are some of the contents that I wanted. I was not very please with that at all. For the price I paid it should have all been in the book.Reba Jones
4,Wonderful Book,"I borrowed this book from the Library last year. The story is magnificent. The best part of the book though are the illustrastions. If you enjoy the play Cats and ohter T.S. Eliot poems, i highly suggest this book."
2,Very outdated,I shudder to think of all the inexperienced dog owners out there who are now doing alpha rolls for ordinary dog behavior. I have herad this book quoted for years so when I finally got around to reading it I was highly disappointed. There's actually a section in the book that teaches you how to hit your dog. Twenty years ago I'm sure that it was a great book but a lot of the theories have since been disproved. I would read the book for reference and then find a book with a more positive approach.
3,a bit disappointing,"Perhaps at one time this was one of the definitive dog training books, but it's seriously outdated. It also reflects -- far too well -- the times in which it was written.Here is an actual quote from the book (page 74): ""The old dichotomies of good and evil, body and spirit, animal and man, are still played out dramatically in pet-owner relationships."""
1,Disappointing book,"I was very anxious to receive this book as it had been very highly rated. I never got past the discipline portion. The Monks recommend that when a dog misbehaves, you should hit him under the chin........and if he doesn't ""yelp"" you didn't hit him hard enough. THIS IS TRAINING????????? I was looking for a training book on positive reinforcement, not beating and abusing a dog to train him. Now I'm back at Amazon looking for a better training book."
2,Completely the wrong book for my dog!,"A friend recommended this book to me highly, and she could not have been more wrong. I had a small rescued terrier who had been abused, and the techniques in this book made things far, far worse. German sheperds are one thing; small terrified dogs are quite another. They should make that crystal clear in the text. I spent months with a behaviorist, in part undoing the damage this book did."
1,Rehash makes Krugman RICHER,"Book is basically a rehash of Krugman's op-eds from the newspaper that brought us JAYSON BLAIR. He is seething with hate, which clouds his judgement and credibility. Sad."
2,Pre-determined philosophy disguised as factual discourse,"Interesting read but too much self-fulfilling rationalizations, disguised as analysis, of a pre-disposed socialisticeconomic orientation."
4,"""Just say no"" to Krugman's detractors - please read the book","One of the reviewers further down this page sums it up perfectly: ""..while the third of the nation that is close-minded and ideologically-blindered on the right may give the author short shrift, the other two thirds .... should take Krugman very seriously.""Furthermore, I'd encourage you to keep on reading through ALL the reader reviews of this book - there's presently another 63 below this one - because you'll see just HOW close-minded (and hateful!) many of Krugman's detractors are. The idiotic 'reviews' from these people reinforce what huge trouble America is getting itself into."
1,Krugman Is A Very Stupid Guy,"Krugman is a very stupid guy but he is no centrist. He is a leftist. He opposes the Bush administration because he knows what they're doing will be good for the country, not because he is a principled man; even his own mother thought very little of him according to family and friends. His columns speak to the unreality of today's America with the disdain and arrogance of a Princeton economics professor.His thesis, which appears to derive from an excess of prescription medications, is that the Bush Administration seeks to basically eliminate the 20th century--get rid of social security, medicare, unions, all of FDR's New Deal, etc., etc. If you are prepared to believe that load of crap, then you probably will like this book; it'll make you mad and your head will explode. On the other hand, if you possess even a scintilla of intelligence, then you will know that former Enron advisor, Paul Krugman, is a bloody fool and a true moron."
4,Explains a lot.,"We went from a half trillion dollar surplus to an almost trillion dollar deficit in the span of 3 years. I picked up the book solely on the hopes of a half near cohesive explanation.What I got was a bunch of op-ed pieces but when taken in context of one followed by the other, followed by the other, it gives a great detailed account of where this country is going economically. Scary stuff let me tell you."
1,Ex-Enron Consultant fails to come clean,When will Krugman talk about how he was a (well) paid for Enron as they were scamming investors and Enron employees who lost their life savings. Come clean Krugman!
2,There's No Crying In Baseball.,"Having disgraced itself the NEW YORK TIMES wants us to forgive and forget. Krugman's role is pitch man, which means he is supposed to be a stuffed shirt. He says whatever come into his head. Did we lose our way? Define ""way.""America was on top but fell off. Sensible people like Chinese, Koreans and Japanese hold most dollars. Texans can't fight their way out of a paper bag. American morals make the world cringe. If you travel you will deny your citizenship. We can't sell bonds or buy oil.Honesty demands that we respect hegemony of the Asian axis and the late arival of Germany-Russia. That's our world now - watching from the sidelines. If Krugman were a useful economist he would not mince words about it. America has no reason to be great and nothing to be great with. The New York Times is not a great newspaper because we are not a great nation. All the op-ed prose in the world won't get us back in the game.Of course, writhing is inevitable and so are tears."
1,Please Read The Book,"To all you Krugman fans and would-be fans....I urge you to read the book. Unlike the dim bulb from Chicago, an ACTUAL reading of the book by someone with an intelligent an objective mind will find that it is mostly a collection of modified press releases and fleshed-out talking point memos distributed by the Democratic National Committee.On those infrequent occasions when the former Enron advisor actually writes a column on the subject of his alleged ""expertise,"" it takes a veritable army of real economists to follow along behind and correct the numerous errors and misstatement of facts....sort of like the people in the circus with the brooms trailing behind the elephants."
1,How can a Free Market economist be socialist like Krugman?,"In this book, Krugman seems to lack a basic understanding of market economics. Wasteful spending is what causes deficits Krugman! Tax cuts to both corporations and individuals can and have under both the JFK and Reagan administrations raised revenue coming into the treasury. That is because tax cuts increase the revenue needed for capital investment. It is investment in new ideas that keeps the economy going and creates more jobs. Under Bush, we have increases in spending across the board which makes Bush a fiscally moderate Republican not a Reagan Republican (Krugman thinks your a radical if you want to let people keep a little more of the money they earn) Finally, when a liberal like Krugman starts talking about free market economic policy you have to laugh because Marxism is his religion - there was no free market in the U.S.S.R."
5,Brilliant Economic Analysis of What Ails Our Goverment,"This collection of columns written by Paul Krugman with some material to tie them together deliver a hard-hitting condemnation of the misguided economic and political ways of our current federal government. In some ways, this book is depressing because how time and time again the current administration has shown itself to be anything but fiscal conservatives. For 3+ years, the government has waddled from the bad policy of tax cuts as a cure for surpluses, deficits, war, you name it. Krugman addresses these issues from an economists view and delivers insights that cut through the political jargons to the heart of the matters. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to see spelled out how utterly bad and utterly corrupt Bush's policies are."
5,Thorough and very clear,"I teach Cisco Academy Courses. I've looked at many RAS books and I never liked any of them. This book is a stand out. It is accurate, it does not ""wave hands"" like most RAS books, and the explanations are crispy."
3,worthwhile,"This is a book by a very conventional trainer about the training and care of Unbridled to win the Derby and Breeder's Cup. Mr. Nafzger sets out the training program of Unbridled, and for his stable, and as such the book gives a valuable insight into the methods of one successful trainer. I think Mr.Nafzger is to be congratulated and thanked for putting all this in writing. If you want to know how the majority of your trainers at the race track operate, this book is most instructive."
4,Very informative and easy to understand,Carl Nafzger goes a great job going over the aspects of race horse training in a manor even a person not involved in racing can follow. Great Book for all horseman and wanna be horseman
1,2 Or Less,"Everything about this production is 2nd rate-or worse. Not only don't we have any of the important members of the original cast, we also don't get the writing, the pacing, or the production values-some of the animal characters appear to be done with plastic simulacrums! This is really painful to look at-I got through about 30 minutes and I rarely turn off a film. This isn't even good enough for afternoon television-junk cartoon fare. I'm amazed Disney would release this piece of tripe under their banner."
4,Death Riders,"I liked most, but not all of the movies in this set. I really liked the Death Riders documentary a lot. It alone was worth the price I paid for the set. I've gotten other sets with large collections of movies like this but many of those other sets were disappointing. This one has some good stuff on it."
5,Great flavor and low caloric with lots of protein.,"This product has great flavor, is low caloric (90), and has 23 grams of protein per scoop. It tastes even better mixed with fruits like a piece of banana, mango, and even prunes and bran cereal. A serving for breakfast fills you up all morning and takes away your appetite. The ""Magic Bullet"" blender mixes it very well and conveniently. Highly recommend."
3,An introduction to complexity theory and the Santa Fe group,"Although I am personally not a fan of the author's screenplay/journalistic writing style (the focus of the book is not complexity theory, but the lives of a few scientists in the context of the Santa Fe research group), this book introduced me to the very interesting studies of the Santa Fe institute and their focus on the science of complexity. I particularly valued the easily digestible introduction to the economic theory of increasing returns.Stefania LucchettiAuthor of ""The Principle of Relevance""The Principle of Relevance"
1,Good for Science groupies - no description of theory here!,"I found it impossible to tolerate the hundreds and hundreds of pages of oggeling the great men of science and the mundane minutia of thier careers, personalities and personal lives. There's not a single equation or chart in the whole book.Look elsewhere if you want to get up to speed on the ""new science""."
2,uuuuuuuuuuggggghhhhhh,The most boring book I have read in a long time. Cut the biography crap. The majority of the book is the history of a few guys involved in the study of complexity. Actual information on complexity is scarce and it is very hard to get through the first hundred pages. After that the book is quasai readable but still cut the history junk and delve into the subject everyone paid money to read! I can sum up almost all of the first hundred pages in a single sentence. At Sante Fe University the various groups of scientist faced money problems but end up dedicating themselves to Complexity.
1,World's worst rip-off.,"This is the worst rip-off of a game made off a such a wonderful movie. If you could get through being able to understands the horrific instructions, you would then identify how terrible the game is. It was just slapped together sponging off the movie. This game is going in the trash as it's not worth the space in my house. Many other reviews go into more detail how bad this game really is.Luckily is was bought in a discount store for $2.49 (yes two dollars and 49 cents)- which was $2.49 too much."
2,Christmas Story Board Game,Very disappointed in this game. The rules are hard to understand and there are not enough questions.
5,Magic when these foks get together,"This CD was so much better than I thought it would be. I'm a huge Bill frisell fan but haven't heard too much Jerry granelli that I care for. This CD is lush, gorgeous, funky and and it just plain cooks. The dueling guitars approach completely works with each guitarist ofering their strengths into the unique blend of New Orleans funky, chet baker-esque slow numbers. Highly recommended. One of my favorite Bill Frisell records."
5,A must have for a hypnotherapist,This book which gives some fundamental insights into the ego-state therapy. It is essential to have read this one for every hypnotherapist.
2,Bowl,Very flimsy dents easily very light and thin not to be used for heavy mixing and stirring should only be used for storing.
4,Interesting,"Very interesting, fairly well written book. But, I think the author needs to invest in a thesaurus. She kept repeating the same words over & over ad nauseum (example for law enforcement officers, she kept using ""the lawmen."")"
5,mostly great fun,"I can hardly add much to Jennifer's review, except that this got a little gratuitously explicit in one scene. By the way, has Myrna Mackenzie been peeking over Day Leclaire's shoulder? Jackson bears a striking resemblance to Mathias Blackstone, and Helena's brothers will have you remembering Hanna Salvatore's stepsons . . ."
2,not really what i thought it would be.,"this is not that smooth nice...crunk album,that lil jhon really makes....if you cop...you might be shock!!!!"
5,LOVE DAVID as POIROT,"Poirot has been so entertaining for me-I just retired & discovered the series & simply had to have all of the DVD's. He is also in a play in London this fall & I am planning to attend & see my favorite actor. I rented his old movies from the past & he is fantastic.The sets of another era are so romantic & by owning the DVD's I can rerun them & see things I failed to see the first time around. What luxury to have them in my library for easy viewing. Last summer they were on Digital TV and now I can hardly find them so glad I have them when I need a ""Poirot Fix""!!"
5,WOW!,"This is a great album! The more I listen, the more I like. All three players are astounding, the sound is superb, and the music covers everything from blues to funk to rock to Weather Report, to... This is a recording that deserves some quality listening time and is well worth it."
1,Messy Product,Jerome Russell Spary On Hair Color is messy and comes out of spray can too heavy. It got on my clothes and bedding. The dark brown has too much red in it. I would never order this product again and don't recommend it.
5,Easy to use,Easy to use. I was able to roll it into a ball with one hand and put it into my baby's ear without much difficulty. And they stayed in quite well.
2,Too simple,This little book doesn't contain enough of the facts needed for one to truly investigate Mormonism. It has been around a long time. There are better books available.
2,Lame,"The hippies are pissed off because ""the man"" makes them wear clothes and shower, and won't let them smoke dope, so ""the man"" puts a fence around the hippies to keep them away from the public, and the hippies break down the fence and go skinny dipping. There is a good deal of hippie nudity, and the music is pretty good, but the acting, story, dialogue, direction, and editing, are all pitiful. I found the whole mess painfully boring, I wish I could go back in time and slap whoever is responsible for producing this heap of nonsensical garbage, or at least get my money and time I wasted on it back."
1,bad news,"this is NOT sampler 10I've been trying to get it for months - ended up with thismight be good, but it's not sampler 10"
5,Second Kiss,"I read Nakoa's Woman about 25 years ago, and have never forgotten it, especially the haunting ending. I just reread it under a dif. title, SECOND KISS. This books speaks of the continuation of the soul, about us being on this Earth to love and grow. The poignant and heart wrenching love between Nakoa and Maria is so well written and lyrical, that joy and tears are elicited. The author deeply understands the struggles and the rapture of finding one's self, surrender and acceptance. The American Indian culture is authentically portrayed, and contrasted against the white man's world. You must treat your mind and heart to reading this book. Gayle Rogers, if you read this please mail me. Thank you for writing such a wonderful book that touched my soul."
5,Le Fanu's First Gothic Novel,"Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu is studied today as Victorian gothic writer. Although he wrote several gothic mystery novels, some of his best work, however, may be discovered within his shorter tales such as ""Green Tea,"" ""Carmilla,"" etc. The House by the Churchyard was his first gothic novel, but it was unlike his other gothic novels due to the comical nature of the work. Although the gothic elements are indeed present, the humor which is found within this text is truly delightful; I could not help but to chuckle at a few select scenes. Unfortunately, this work seems to be falling out of print. Therefore, I would recommend to the literary student, who may be trying to acquire Le Fanu's work, to locate a good used copy on Amazon. This particular edition (Pocket Classics) is a good copy with a thick and durable paperback cover."
3,Better than usual DTV fodder,"I was expecting pure crap when I first saw this but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. Decent acting, good cinematography, good camera work, good stunts, and Jake Busey seems to be having the time of his life. Too bad his role isn't better written and is just given the usual psycho-guy-making-wisecracks part. All in all, a harmless way to kill a rainy Saturday afternoon."
5,Celeste,"Celeste's voice can put you in a trance! I enjoy all her music, all her cd's are awsome. Her songs have such meaning that anyone can relate to, I have been listening to her music for years, it is great to see her music is becoming available on Amazon, way to go!"
4,Start reading... and sailing right,"Start Sailing right has all the right features for the beginning sailor. The simplified language and detailede illustrations make it a beginners textbook, but an old timer's great review. My wife is a novice and is learning a lot quickly... I like it!"
2,Disappointing!,"I was so excited to get this boombox to use the c.d. player. There is NO bass. The volume control is manual, and it doesn't get very loud. Finally, the remote doesn't even have a volume control on it.It is lightweight and it does have a c.d. player, cassette, and radio for such a small unit. However, I really was counting on it being louder and to use the remote.Disappointing to say the least. It's been less than 6 mos. I've had it and the manual volume control is already giving me that static sound when I move it around - uggh.Buy something else - this isn't worth the money!"
2,Not For Music Lovers,"If you are looking for a rich dynamic sound, then you need to spend more money and look for something else. This boombox is the lightest unit that I have ever seen (for it's size), so that should help to explain the weak sound quality. The CD player locked up one time and had to be shut down and restarted a few times in order to get it to play. I purchased this unit for my mother-in-law so she could listen to bible CD's...I guess it's ok for that purpose though.I would suggest a person look at the Sony ZS-X10 boombox instead...It has great sound quality and the price is right too."
3,Not bad for the money but there are better,"This JVC is a very simple design and so is the remote control. The remote control should control the power on/off feature but it does not! It does not even control the volume or mute, it just controls the CD operation and that's it. Very disappointed with this so called remote. The sound is just okay, it does not have a bass, treble or even super bass option. This unit is the BARE BASICS, nothing more - nothing less...It will be good for kids or for the job site..."
3,not as cushy as I'd hoped,"Bought these for work. Standing and walking for 6+ hours. Did make a difference, but not as cushy as I'd hoped."
5,Standard deviants physics parts 1 and 2,The DVD's were better than I had expected with such a diverse subject as physics.
3,"I should hate the book, but I still want to read the next one.","The premise is interesting (and would make for a great Disney Channel movie). I've worked in the Magic Kingdom and it holds a special place in my heart. The story was good until the end where it was rushed and fell apart a little bit and became a tad tacky. The writing isn't the greatest, and is tedious at times. The locations and logic has gaping holes in it, and the characters are incredibly flat. Despite all this, somehow I still can't say I don't like it. I think it could have been written better, even edited better, but by the end the book sets up the next part to well. After thinking about it, that's all that saves this book from being horrible is how it has a video game sense and the prologue sense. It's a prologue stretched out and that's the root of the problems.However if you can get through poor writing, (subpar even for teen and children's lit standards) it's a fun read that can only get better with the sequel."
2,Not good reading for girls,"Although I thought this book was entertaining I was very disappointed by the way the female characters were portrayed.2 of the girls were very shallow and stupid sounding (extemely annoying) seemingly unconcerned with the task at hand. The others were evil.In the end the boys were the heros, rescuing one of the helpless girls from an evil witch woman.The girls were also describe in terms of their level of physical attractiveness, beauty, sexuality. The boys weren't.I hate to be so picky, but it was sort of disappointing to see this level of passive sexism in a book for younger teens."
3,'Kingdom Keepers',"While 'Kingdom Keepers'has a creative storyline and the quick-moving plot keeps you reading, Pearson leaves lots of loose ends and doesn't develope his characters very thoroughly. The whole thing seems like an add for Dinsney! Also, Pearson writes like he's planning on having the book made into a movie, which is extremely obnoxious."
2,uggg,my friend told me tbis book was good read the first few chapters n realized it was really boring and i love reading. not a book i woud recomend
4,My son likes it,"My eight year old says this was a good book. He hasn't asked me for any other books in the series, so I'm not sure if he loved it. He loves Percy Jackson, spider-wick chronicles and 39 clues!"
4,Good or Disney fanatics,"First let me start with we are complete Disney fanatics. I also love other Ridley Pearson books. It caught my eye when we were on vacation at Disney World. That all said, this was an entertaining book. I really enjoyed some of the ins and outs of the parks. It was fun to read while we were vacationing there. The concept of virtual guides is also very interesting. It is a good read for the average Joe but if you are Disney junkies, it is a must."
3,book on disney fiction kingdom keepers,"Gave as a gift so don't know yet, I think it sound like it's interesting to a child of 8 to 10 years of age."
4,Reflects impact of celebrity on intimate family life,"John Wayne: A Novel was beautifully done. Simple language exposes the intricate layers of influence between a Hollywood Legend and an American family. Lillian Barden is particularly moving as a woman struggling to surface in a marriage which has foundered. Her husband, Frank Barden's best ambition is to love her. He stumbles onto John Wayne as guide with somewhat disasterous results. But the disaster is in the heart of the Barden Family. John Wayne remains both human and icon, unscathed."
5,Get cooking!,I saw this book on my best friends kitchen shelf. Every time I'm in her kitchen I look for a recipe to add to my long list of recipes. I've finally decided to buy my own copy. I like the fact that I don't need a massive list of ingredients to create really tasty food. I defy anyone not to find this book a revolution in gourmet cooking.
5,Love this Presto Fryer .,"I have used cheep fryers for years . They just don't do it . I help out in the kitchen at the American Legion, Post 135 Florida . We have a double Deep fryer , with the heating elements down in the oil . When you put the food in , the temp does not drop . Thats why I like this Presto fryer . It maintanes the temp when the food is put in the oil . This maks for crispy food , not oil soaked . I am super happy with it . What more can I say . Anyone who buys one of these will love the way it works . Thank you . Dave C ."
1,Detachable magnetic plug is a bad idea,The magnetic plug does not connect tightly to the heating element. I bought 2 of these and both have the same problem. Until this problem is addressed. I cannot advise getting this product.
5,Usage,"We use this maybe a couple time a month, holidays it works fine warms up nice not to quick but just like everything has has hot oil your going to get splatter, so keeps some paper towels around common sense"
5,"A fun, easy-to-read Trollope","Not as much politics as in most Trollope books, so an easy, fast read, and immensely entertaining and satisfying."
3,Good slowly rcounted love story.,"This an old school love story, vey old school:Victorian Era. The book moves slowly, however it is a very good love story."
5,The New American Bible,This Bible is easy to use. The price is afordable and many people recomend it.
1,Deceptive,This is a poorly written book that is deceptive and contains many untruths.It changes the true Word of God.
3,FAMILY DINNING & ITALIAN COOKING,"THE BOOK WAS FINE, I WAS UPSET, HOWEVER, WHEN I BOUGHT ONE BOOK, THE OFFER CAME UP TO PURCHSE THE SECOND ONE WITH FREE SHIPPING IF DONE WITHING THE NEXT FIVE MINUTS. I DID THIS, BUT THE BOOKS CAME SEPERATE AND I PAID SHIPPING ON BOTH. AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE NO PHONE # TO CONTACT YOU GUYS. DON'T APPRECIATE PAYING DOUBLE FOR SHIPPING. I HAVE MY PRINTED RECEIPTS WHICH SHOW THE ORDERS BEING DONE BACK TO BACK.RENE"
5,Perfect!,"I LOVE this book! I'm a married college student with very little time to cook. My husband and I are both pretty health-concious, so when I do cook, I try to be careful.Giada's recipes are so easy to follow. At first, I had to head to the grocery store because her recipes required a lot of ingredients I didn't have. But now that I've stocked up, I'm one happy cook.The meals I've made so far are delicious--and easy to make!I love Everyday Italian and watch it when I can. This book is an excellent addition to any Italian food-lover's collection."
1,Sophomoric,"Some funny bits. Largely junior high humor. Maybe if one was drunk ... (As it happens, the copy I got is also unpleasant to read since it's a musty, old used version.)"
2,Unhappy Mom,"We ordered several dragonball z toys; however, this one arm keeps coming off. This one is poorly made. We hope to exchange for another."
5,Strategies for using technology in special education.,"This book describes how technology is an important ally toeducation leaders who aid students who have learning problems, majorcognitive disabilities, or physical disabilities. It offers strategies for technology implementation to improve curriculum, assessment, and administration. Readers learn to assess their needs; choose and fund technology; and create policy frameworks, long-range technology plans, and due process procedures. An extensive resource list provides contact information and describes individuals and local organizations that offer asistance. Published by NSBA and the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Special Education Programs."
4,"New Blue Dog Art Included, But Quality Not the Same","I collect the Blue Dog Calendars for the art (a Blue Dog for every week of the year!). Rodrigue now has a new publisher/printer and the change is very noticable. The calendar for 2004 looks more childlike, with a garish bright yellow background on the cover and bright yellow plastic spiral spine (don't know what else to call it). The print quality is not as good as past calendars either. However, it is a great deal for the price. I LOVE the page with Louis Armstrong and Blue Dog. I've only seen this print in expensive Jazz Fest posters."
4,Nothing but blue...,"I picked up Blue Dog on a whim the other day, and sat down to read it alone in my room. It offered a fresh look at love, and its continuance through and beyond death. Tiffany's (Blue Dog) life and death influenced Rodrigue to a very great extent. Yet he did not realize the impact she had until after she passed. I would recommend this book to anyone in need of an hour of thought or, in particular, an hour of true unconditional love."
5,Observant Adventurer,"Powerful lessons, yet enjoyable to read. Through the words of the native inhabitants Mr. Tayler provides eye-opening insight into religious fundamentalism, American Foreign Policy and how people who inhabit one of the poorest and most desolate areas on Earth must approach their everyday lives. Although it might actually discourage you from wanting to visit the region, it helps explain in a big way why Africa continues to be a tortured continent. It should be required reading for everyone over the age of 15 especially if you hail from a first world country."
1,Lives of the Pretentious and Fermented,"Whining pretentious ""special"" child of insufferable ugly american francophiles, (names dropped here), fails utterly at journalism career, but goes home to write book (more names dropped here) supposedly about the life in a vineyard/winery. Between the descriptions of her cool clothes and wonderful parties she finds a little time to run to the chais to ask her wine maker husband basic questions about wine making, that she then inserts into her partylogue as if she knows which end of a corkscrew is up. For pure unadulterated masochism try reading this out loud, preferably to someone who loves you and has a black sense of humor. If an editor has ever seen this book, I would be highly surprised."
4,Good Old Alan Jackson,Can never get fedup of listening to Alan Jackson. Love the song Tropical Depression.
2,HP TC1100 Docking Station lacks CD or DVD unit,"I am in Baghdad, Iraq and we ordered 10 HP tablet TC1100's plus docking stations. I didn't even think to search through all the detailed info on another providers website to determine if it came with a CD or DVD unit. IT DOES NOT. NEITHER DOES THE DOCKING STATION. This means you have to spend another $180 for a ""multibay"" CD unit to insert into the empty ""multibay"" drawer in the base of the docking station. AND, since the tablet doesn't have any place for a cd dvd unit, I would suggest skip the docking station and just get an external usb driven cd/dvd unit for about $180 - get some other brand just to get even with HP for not making it clear anywhere that a CD unit is OPTIONAL. Just like this posting on Amazon - no details at all about what you get. Go to the hp.com website and research the details."
5,Loved the first one so much I bought a second for my wife,"Got screaming good deals both times on Amazon. Great for those who wear eyeglasses. Amazingly small. Sound is probably 8 out of 10, which is fine for the majority of my calls. Plenty loud but doesn't seem to have the noise cancellation features that more expensive units have."
3,Average product,The product is ok for the price. Fairly light and easy to use.The ear hanging hook is quite brittle and broke off in about 3 weeks. However the product can still be used.
2,It does not work with Blackberry cell phone,I got one blackberry curve. But this bluetooth wireless headset did not work with it.
2,Some bad comments,"I had LG Black chocolate since last year, I did decent research before the purchase. After reviewing and getting recommendation from friends, I finally decide to get this one. But the earpiece somehow doesn't fit my ear at all. I have to hold it while listening. Also, the sounds quality is not good, it is noisy while I am driving and talking. I tried to use it often, but I really need to buy a new one.The lesson is, always try the actually product before the purchase if possible."
2,Reluctantly Returing It,"This is a great headset. Good range. Wonderful audio quality on both ends of a call. Like the idea of the in the ear design.Unfortunately, I couldn't get a satisfactory fit. I tried all their ear size pieces and couldn't get a good fit with my particular ear. It wasn't bad when I was stationary. However, once I started walking it would literally fall out of my ear no matter which of the three earsize pieces I was using.So, back it goes. It may work great for some people and not so good for others depending on their particular ear geometry, size and shape. I really wish they had some type of removable/optional over-the-ear attachment option so I could make this work."
4,Comes with ear hook,"I was hesitant to purchase this product based on other reviewers. Everyone's chief complaint was that the ear piece didn't fit. I almost bought an additional ear hook based on those reviews. Well there was no need. The headset I got today came with an ear hook and additionally sized rubber covers. It fits in my ear and stays there with no problemsFor the price -- on sale at $23.00 -- this headset can not be beat. It's easy to sync, has a great range of reception and is really sleek."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this primarily because of new laws in Washington punishing people who hold cell phones up to their heads while driving. I rarely call anyone on the road, but sometimes I get calls and I don't want to get a ticket. This little puppy was easy to get working with my Samsung cell phone, but it seems like I get a lot of distortion, even with the volume set to its lowest level. I can't understand people who are speaking to me about half the time. I have decided to shop for another unit. It may be my own fault. Perhaps I have failed to make some critical adjustment. Or it may be I am talking to people who are using cheap phones. Like I said, I don't use it much. I don't think driving and talking on the phone is either safe, or a good idea. I hope your experience is better than mine."
5,Great item !!!!!!!!!!!!,nothing have to say.. just buy and try it!You will love it....One thing I don't like it catch small noise too.
1,Samsung WEP200,this is not original samsung WEP200 I owen one that right i know I purchase at FRy compare the one I buy in Fry and amazon is total different.
2,a lot in a little package,This is my first bluetooth device and so far I love it. It is very small and fits easily into my ear. I liked it so much that I ordered one for my son. He uses it a lot more than I do and he likes the sound quality and function but says it keeps falling out of his ear (which is why I didn't give it 5 stars). I would definitely recommend this product.I've downgraded my review because it stopped working within months of getting it.
3,SERVICEABLE!!!,This product does exactly what it says it does. I am satisfied with it and it is exactly what I needed.
3,Good Overall,This is a nice small unit. It does have tendency to fallout. It fits OK in one ear and not in the other. I also find I can not use the retainer device as it is big for my ears.
3,Compact. Not the best,"It's 2nd headset I had. I used to have Moto HS850. WEP200 is better as far as connection; way to operate it. Easy to carry it around. It doesn't solid stay in my ear even I used the largest loop. So I won't always put it in my ear, only when there is a call. The voice is clear in in-door or inside the car with windows up. Noise cancelling is not as good as HS850. When I walk on the street in a little windy climate, the other party start complaining the noise. This is what Samsung needs to find the way to improve it."
5,Great buy...,"Small, convenient, elegant, excellent reception and the best of all, fabulous price, I saw the same Bluetooth at T-mobile store and it was $89.00 if you buy this that will be a smart decision you won't be disappointed."
3,Well...,"This was my second one. That's how much I like this model. The problem with my last one is that I work outside and sweat a bit, so it didn't stay in my ear quite as well as I'd liked and didn't come with a hook. This time, I ordered this one due to it coming with a hook, only to have the hook break after 5 uses. The problem is that you have to remove the hook in order to charge. So the constant removing and re-attaching is what caused the break."
1,Doesn't anyone make a decent bluetooth?,"This is my second attempt at buying a bluetooth device and both were terrible. The Samsung is constantly falling out of my ear, even with the optional behind the ear hook. Reception is terrible and full of static. I would definately not recommend this item to anyone."
4,WEP200 Bluetooth Headset Kit,"I was amazed at the small size and the overall performance of this device, I purchased this for my wife and have expirienced excellent call quality after trying many other devices which had much worse performance of sound and noise rejection. Occasionally there are disturbances due to road noise but, overall this has been the best headset wired or wireless that she has used. I would give it a thumbs up."
3,WEP200 with the Treo 650 Palm phone,"I don't recommend any Treo 650/700 users trying to sync the WEP200 with this phone. It seems to work fine when your making a call and the clarity is great. Unfortunately when receiving a call or switching to another call causes the WEP200 to either go into mute mode or hangs up completely. It's very comfortable to wear and virtually static free, but I should have spent the money and purchased the Palm Bluetooth head set."
4,Samsung Earpiece,"The WEP200 I bought is a back-up for the one I already own. I lost the charger/carry case, so it was cheaper to buy another unit than to get just the charger. I had 3 Motorolas & 2 Plantronics before this one, and I am happy with the reliability of the Samsung. Sometimes I have trouble keeping it in my ear, but switching ears is as simple as twisting the ear loop. Plus with 3 different sizes of loops, its easy to find the perfect fit. The Samsung website had these units for more money than Amazon.com. E-Bay is cheaper, but when you buy cheap, you get cheap! Plus, I've had nothing but trouble with E-Bay. Amazon.com is great, especially when they offer free shipping on some items. i'll be back for future purchases."
1,Not for Iphone,"I Initially like it for the size and price, pairing with a Iphone was absolutely easy. I have a 3G and this thing is horible when paired up.1) Picks a ton of background noise and everything else except my voice.2) Doesnt stay in the ear, had to pick it up multiple times from ground when walking.3) People at the other end of the line can barely hear me when am at the top of my voice.4) Seems to have been good and went to worse.5) Unusable at this point, i have to use the wired heasset or phone directly.Will pay for shipping and returned even if i get couple bucks back for this."
3,Be cautious,"I purchased this headset for use with my N900 and on the first day of use I was disappointed. It's light-weight, fits perfect without the external hook but, after pairing it to the phone I was unable communicate using the set for some unknown reason. Eventually I had to pair it again.It appears when there is long periods of inactivity the headset ""disconnects"" electronically, yet it says connected to the phone. Though I am able to use this device you have to regularly pair the device to the phone.I love to read reviews and I am taking the time to write this review in an effort to guide future shoppers who are looking for guidance before purchasing.I like the package and every other thing except the frequency with which one has to reconnect this device to the phone.If SAMSUNG can rectify the problem with this device ""dropping"" after being paired then I will certainly recommend it. Oh, the LED light can certainly be much smaller."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,I BOUGHT TWO JUST TO HAVE ONE CHARGING WHILE I USE THE OTHER ONE.BIG MISTAKE!!! BOTH STOP CHARGING WITH NO REASONSIT WORKS OK JUST FOR A FEW MONTHS.
3,"bad, bad,bad,bad,bad!!!!","I was applying for my new T Mobile account. I got this, and i was thrilled, never thought i would get a Bluetooth headset. when i came home i was unhappy. it works good when charged, but to charge it is like wrestling a grizzly bear. you put it into the charging case, only to come back 1 minute later seeing it not charging. the case is to loose! exchanged for another one, still no good. 3 stars was for when it was good. change it, samsung!ps. it also looks very cheap."
4,Good,"This is nice. I really like having this, especially when working. Sometimes the reception can be a little fuzzy, but nothing bad. Great deal for the price!"
3,Horrible!,"Bad product, never liked. Too much room for road noise and no one could ever hear me talking. Would not recommend this to anyone!"
2,Total waste of time,"I have a Samsung M610 phone and purchased the WEP200 soley based on the manufacturer. I recently tried the Plantronics 655 and it didn't pair well with my phone, so I thought I would try a device from Samsung. Unfortunately, it didn't make a difference. I still only had a range of a couple of feet from my phone and everyone I spoke with said I sounded muffled. I am guessing it is because the mic is so far from my mouth and rests against my cheek.I ended up sending this unit back."
4,Great Product! Just not what I needed.,"Bought it for my girlfriend. Didn't fit her ear so I had to return it. It fit mine fine and sounded great, I already have a bluetooth though, so I'd fare better with the cash back rather than 2 of em lol. The return went way better than I expected. Full refund in less than a week. I just had to pay to ship it back, and I added signature confirmation for additional measures. Great product, wish I coulda kept it. It's fit has nothing to do with ear canal size as it's not an earbud, it fits in the larger groove of the ear. So those with small to average sized ears, enjoy!"
4,good product,"It has good reception and fits nicely in your year - without the need for ear loops. Its also one of the smallest ear sets around. On the down side, its one of a kind charging mechanism (not compatible with other devices) makes it a throw away if the housing or charger gets lost or broken. Battery life is average"
5,Great little headset!!!,"I shopped a while to find and affordable, reliable BT headset. I wanted a Jawbone, but they are just too expensive. Plus I wouldn't use it enough to warrant spending the money. I found this one and like the fact that you can use it without the earhook and it's compact design. It is roughly the size of the top half of a normal person's thumb. It really pics up sound wonderfully and is very easy to use. I recommend this to a first time bluetooth user to someine who is used to using bluetooth and wants a better set. The mic is good, but will pic up some noise. I was using it while I was raking leaves and the person I was talking to said it was very lousd. So it is sensitive, but pics up voice crystal clear."
2,Worked for about 2 weeks..,"This product has bad craftmanship.. I read the negative and positives about the product and figured that some people just didn't know how to use it. I purchased this item for my wife and it worked just fine for the first 2 weeks. Then it started turning off by itself about 2 minutes after she powered it up. Once, she even let it charge overnite to be certain it had a full charge. Still the same results. Just bad craftmanship I figure. Returned it and Amazon understood and was great as usual with their customer service. (Gotta love these guys)"
4,My first bluetooth,"This is a nice product for the price. Works well. I broke the piece that connect to the ear (flimsy plastic and hard to put on/take off to charge) but fits fine in my ear without. For a first time user that doesn't use a bluetooth a lot, I would recommend it for the price. If you plan on using your bluetooth a lot, get one that fits the ear more securely."
3,good quality but short battery life,"I received this product quickly in the mail and charged it right away. The sound quality is good and clear and my phone found it and synced immediately. I am a little annoyed at the short battery life, after wearing it for a day I find I have to charge it at night. Expect to charge the ear piece every day. The only other minor problem with it is that it can sometimes leave your inner ear sore from prolonged use. After a few days though, my ear got used to it. Overall I like the small size and good quality of this product. I won't be replacing it anytime soon."
1,Disappointed,I had a Samsung WEP200 that I lost so i looked on line to get the same one. The orginal one I bought from a T-Mobil store. This is not the same quality nor it it a Samsung. When it connects to your phone it says WEP not Samsung. The other one I had said Samsung when it connected and on the front. It is a fake with poor quality. I bought 2 of them and they are not clear and one of them does not even say Samsung on it.
1,No good,"This is my third samsung bluetooth. I order the same one each time. I've never had a problem with them until now. there's a lot of static. When I talk to someone, I can hear the person but they can't hear me. I'm extremely dissatisfied."
2,Not quite good enough,"Even though this is a top rated bluetooth earpiece by consumer reports, I couldn't get it to stay in my ear. I thought about using the Jabra ear gels but the reviews on those were not all that great. I returned the WEP200 and purchased the Plantronics Explorer 340 instead. I'm very happy with the Plantronics which has a small loop to fit over the ear, the sound quality is excellent, and it is not much larger than the WEP200."
4,Samsung WEP200,"I must say I am very pleased, the headset is very small along with the volume being good as well. The clearity is good and you can even put it in your top pocket until your phone ring and it won't bother your at all. Surprisingly I have no problems with the headset staying in my ear. The one negative thing that I would say about this product is outside it picks up all the wind, but if it's not a windy day it's no problem but I think the pros far exceed the cons."
3,Dumb of me to assume it charges via a USB port,I'm sure its great in every other way but requiring a proprietary charger and charging case is a deal killer for me. This device is specifically for travelling. This is a lot of extra junk to carry around with me when there are headsets out there that take a USB charger.
5,TEST YOURSELF.,"I REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY SOME PEOPLE TALK BAD THINGS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT.MAYBE THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR EARS. THIS PRODUCT IS NEAR TO EXCELENT.EXCELENT SOUND, ONLY ONE BUTTON FOR ALL FUNCTIONS, WORKS GREAT WITH SMART PHONES WITH VOICE RECOGNITION AND THE MOST IMPORTANT FIT PERFECTLY IN YOUR EAR. I HAVE TRIED TO JUMP AND SHAKE MY HEAD WITH IT IN, AND IT IS VERY DIFICULT, IT DROP OFF.I ORDERED TO AMAZON THE WEP200 AND LATER I READ ONLY THE BAD OPINIONS. I WAS WORRY BECAUSE I FELT I BOUGTH A BAD PRODUCT. THANKS GOD I DID NOT READ THE BAD OPINION BEFORE GET THIS FANTASTIC HEADSET.THANKS YOU"
4,good product,"It is very easy to pair with my samsung cell, sound quality is great, I havn't experienced any background noises as described by some previous reviewers. I havn't tried use it in public places though, not sure how it behaves in such places as noisy street.overall, it is great for its price."
1,Did not work,"I was unable to connect the Samsung Bluetooth to my Blackberry World Edition, I kept getting error messages ""could not find device""."
3,OK product. Not as good as the Cingular model.,"I bought this product and then had to send it back because it was defective. Amazon.com was amazing and quickly sent me a replacement. The replacement is better, but still not as good as the similar Cingular model. Sometimes my calls transfer from the headset to my cell automatically and randomly, even if I don't press any buttons. Kinda strange. Otherwise, I'm happy with the product. I wish it was a little more reliable."
1,Was not worth it!!,I only had it for a few days and the hook that goes behind the ear broke now the ear piece falls out. You should get more than one ear hook.
5,Use This For PS3 Online,"This little thing works great! I have no complaints at all except that it takes too long to turn on and off (5ish seconds). I use it with my PS3, so I'm not moving much and it stays in my ear nice and tight. You just have to find a way for it to fit and once you get it right, you'll love it. Battery life is big, charge time is small. Does a great job for online play, and I highly recommend it to any online gamer.EDIT: I got this for $11.95 just a few months back. Just about $16 including shipping. It's probably still worth the $23.50. It's a nice headset."
2,"Headset Ok, Ear loop defective",The head set ear piece seems to work well so far. Needs the special little case to recharge batteries which is not a plus. Main complaint is that the plastic ear loop hanger broke after the second or third use. Cheap plastice but I was able to substitute a silicone ear bud tip from another headset which works well. Headset will not stay in ear very well without the loop or something similar.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GAO9T2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
4,Samsung Bluetooth headset,"The size, sound is great,and it is compact. However, this style did not fit well in my ear and constantly dropped while driving. Bought two, lost two."
2,Espresso is not black,"The add says espresso. The phone box says espresso. The phone is black. Called J&R. All phones that are marked espresso are black. I have not used the phone so I can't evaluate the quality but, for reasons on my own I needed a brown phone. J&R were fair in handling the matter. J&R said that they are changing the ad."
1,Too complex for words,"This book along with others by the author are extremely complex and confusing to a student who does not have a working knowledge of this subject. It is as if she went through the dictonary to see how hard of words she could use to make herself look ""super dooper"" smart. You would have to be a medical student to even get the gist of what she is saying. This book's lack of color and understandable diagrams makes it even harder to follow. I would not recommend this book to anyone but PhDs, MDs, and someone who enjoys being utterly confused."
3,Not 1.5 Quart Bowl,"Received the stainless steel mixing bowl. It appeared small for a 1.5 quart size. Ran both water and flour test to ascertain correct size . It is not a 1 1/2 quart, but only 1 quart. - returning it !"
3,Basics covered,"While this book is well written, I did purchase it hoping that it would include more about women with Aspergers who have a neurotypical partner. I struggled with the fact that I identified more with the author's said issues with her Partner with AS, than i did with her explanations for the partner with AS. I was disappointed that her experience only included two women with AS. Having said that, i still think that it is a good book for my partner as he still has to come to terms with my being on the Autistic Spectrum."
2,too vague and short...,"I liked this book, but I think it was too vague and not enough details to really help anything. I was somewhat disappointed."
3,"pretty meh, was expecting more.","It's just plastic/ or whatever plasticy stuff its made out of so it flops around on your head. vision is very poor out of the lenses. ive found it works best when you put a tshirt around your head so it stays put. Overall, its good for show, but not for function or wearing for long periods of time. such as Halloween."
4,nothing new under the sun,"I always thought that the problems Jewish men and Jewish women had with each other were unique to our time. Not so! Prell examines the Jewish press of the early 20th century to show that Jewish men and Jewish women have (mis)understood each other ever since the 19th century mass migration to America. Women generally want good providers, and Jews are no exceptions. I would have devoted a bit more space to the problems caused by prosperity--for example, that as American Jews become more prosperous, women raise their economic standards and less successful Jewish males effectively drop out of the marriage market, thus spurring intermarriage. But well done on what it does cover."
5,MSIA Zeon Kampfer,"Very good articulation and durability. Well done paint job. Basically a copy of its american counter part, just painted a hell of alot better."
2,Not up to her standards,"Although I've read all her books, this is absolutely the worst of the lot. Her previous works were quick, flashy, and entertaining. Chaos Come Again is slow, perplexing and vague. Any concepts and thoughts Baird is trying to convey are lost on me."
1,Ridiculous New Age Fluff,"If you believe that mother earth and the moon have the power to heal you, than this is the book for you. Just empower your feminine nature, and heck, you'll feel better. This is your typical new age opinionated .... Too bad the author is passing off this book as medical advice for women.There's nothing in this book that could be described as ""ground breaking"" information. I'm glad I got this from the library and didn't waste money on this."
3,"Ok, but....","There are some cute ideas in this book, but I have yet to make anything. Bliss' yarn is so overpriced. While I realize you do not have to use her yarn, it makes all the patterns way over the top- If I had taken a second look before buying, I would have left it on the shelf."
4,Mine worked fine . . .,"I'm an intermediate-level knitter and have enjoyed this book for its simple, monochromatic designs and what have been (for me, at least) clear instructions. My daughter is nearly two, and I've made for her a shawl-colored jacket, a dress, and a boat-necked sweater from this book, all of which were simple to create and which compliment her toddler cuteness with their clean lines and clear colors.My only complaint, actually, has to do with the Debbie Bliss yarns themselves. I bought a fuschia wool/cotton for one pattern, and found that it bled when I hand-washed it, which isn't something I'm accustomed to with my handknits."
4,"Finally no more lacy, frilly baby knits!","I've gotten to that time in my life where everyone around me is having babies. I bought this book so that I could have a variety of things to choose from. I've made the boatneck sweater and the raglan cardigan with excellent results! They look very special and very professional, especially when made with the recommended yarn. Yes, it is more expensive, but in most cases you only require 3 or so skeins. So much of what is available for babies is so frilly and fussy. These patterns are much more ""trendy"" - like a smaller version of what an adult would wear. I made the boatneck in a lime green that looks beautiful on my brunette niece! Be careful of pattern typos, a full erratum of all Debbie Bliss's books is available on her web site."
1,Disappointing and Confusing,"The projects in this book are adorable! Sadly the title of this book is very misleading.I have some knitting experience but thought this would be a great way to start on garments that need to fit.A baby sweater?! I thought it would be a quicker, less expensive way to learn to make a sweater.The patterns seem almost cryptic. At first I thought maybe they would make sense to only experienced knitters but have found that is not the case. Even the most experienced knitters seem to ""guess"" at an interpretation.Unfortunately I have purchased a couple of Debbie Bliss books before trying a pattern out. Big mistake.I would recommend really looking over a pattern before buying the book.Good luck!"
5,Baby Knits,This is a very good book. The patterns are simple but stylish and timeless. The instructions are clear. The photos are beautiful and helpful in choosing a pattern and the knitting work as well.
5,Great learning tool,"This book allows you to progress step by step from beginner to fairly expert, garment by garment. The explanations and pictures are very helpful. The patterns and gauges are given for Debbie Bliss's own line of cotton yarn - I used another brand of washable baby wool yarn and it came out beautifully. The baby models in this book are adorable."
3,Didn't really love,"Kind of disappointed with this, there aren't a ton of easy patterns and the ones that are in the book are pretty basic and not very creative. There are cute sweater patterns but I don't think I am there yet, so we'll see. Left wanting more."
3,"Cute pix, difficult patterns","The pattern instructions are not for beginners. I tried 2 projects, 1 completed, 1 pending. I have to go to the local yarn store for help. Even when I did, the woman (who has been knitting her entire life) was confused by the directions. not for a beginner, IMO."
3,An enchanting story...,"In the Unicorn's Creed, Maggie Brown the hearthcrafter witch has once agian found herself in the midst of yet another adventure. Declared a princess at her niece's christening (for acts of bravery in Song of Sorcery), maggie finds herself forced to choose a husband. With the help of the minstrle Colin, her dear friend, MAggie escapes into the forests, where a way to avoid marriage becomes a quest to help Moonshine the unicorn learn the laws of his people, which then becomes a quest to save all unicorns from maggie's dreaded uncle Fearchar. Taunted by werewolves & hampered by Zombies, not to mention the want to get rid of her crown, will maggie be able to cope with the situation at hand? Or will she, Colin, and Moonshine perish at the hands of Maggie's evil Uncle? You'll just have to read this book and find out! I loved the adventure and humor incorperated in the tale."
3,Fairly good sequel,"After I read the first novel in the series, ""Don't Point That Thing at Me,"" and really enjoyed it, I was looking forward to the further adventures of C. Mortdecai. I wasn't disappointed. While not as tight or well designed as the first novel, the central character Charlie uses the same ironic, charming banter that makes these books unique.Since the author was an art dealer, there are several fascinating descriptions of art restoration and forgery techniques. Many have compared the Bonfiglioli writing to P.G. Wodehouse. As a nod of acknowledgement, Mortdecai mentions Wodehouse a couple of times in the novel.If you liked the first one, be sure to pick this one up as well."
5,juicy at a great price,"This was a GREAT deal for a HUGE bottle of Juicy perfume. My sister wanted it but it is so expensive in the store. I would highly recommend buying this product on Amazon because it's the same thing, just for a great price!"
2,"Review on Juicy Couture purchased through Amazon, 3.4 oz","I love the smell of Juicy Couture so I thought I would order it. It was $50 for 3.4 oz and I thought, wow, what a good deal!! But I should have known better. When I received it, I was so anxious to use it and bring it to school. But I noticed after a few uses, the scent faded a little quickly, leading me to think that it might be fake. I can't return it now or ask for a refund because it's been opened and used. But next time I would just rather spend a few $$ extra at the department store so I can ensure that it's real. I am disappointed. One time my mom bought fake Dolce Gabbana off the street in Chinatown, and a few weeks later the top smelt musty, and the scent faded away after a few moments. Therefore, I figured it must it be fake, so I hope the same thing doesn't happen my perfume now. I am really disappointed, but at least my bottle of Juicy Couture doesn't smell musty (yet)....I hope it won't."
1,Diluted,"I was excited to get such a big bottle for such a low price but now I'm upset. Usually when I wear Juicy, the perfume stays on my body/clothes for hours and I ever use a lot. With this product however, I have to basically shower in the perfume and the smell is nonexistent after two hours. I am very disappointed with this product."
4,Love it!,Love the fragrance. Lasts without the fragrance altering or going stale all day. Didn't realize the size was quite so large. The only problem is just to spray a tiny whiff; luckily the scent is delicious.
5,Juicy Coture EAU PARFUM SPRAY,"BEAUTIFUL, LASTING SCENT. GREAT FOR ALL AGES. NOT TOO SWEEY, NOT TO FRUITY OR FLOWERY. VERY CLEAN FRANGRANCE."
4,Great Fragrance!,"Definitely a great fragrance! I love its fruity smell. I received many compliments, even from a few women, something I didn't expect! I would definitely recommend this product!"
5,Perfect Present for Your Wife,"My wife had been bugging me for weeks to get her some perfume for her next present. She showed me all these different brands, different kinds in the brands, etc. One of them was Couture Couture. When it came to be time to buy her a present, my thought immediately went back to the great fragrances of this perfume. I bought it right then and there, and gave it to her when it came in.All I'm saying is that my wife smells great, she's thrilled, and I got a whole heap of brownie points."
4,Get yo Laugh on!,"This is a clean set. Mr. Rice is funny. Good, clean family fun that the whole family can watch."
4,After first listen...,"With some bands, there's an intrinsic, indefinable quality that draws me to their music. King's X is one of those bands. I have all of theirs but Silent Planet and Tape Head, and love them all like children!! :) heh heh...yes. This album has so much grunt and overall beefiness! I'll have to agree with a couple of reviewers and say that (especially being a drummer myself) Jerry's sound and playing on this one just shows a little bit more of what he can do. 10/10 on the new snare sound, too. Cuts through anything! As far as the songs go, business as usual, with a little something different. There are, of course, the great melodies and harmonies. They also seem to have embraced some of the new metal that's out there at the moment, Doug's bass being that little bit lower, and the deviations in the melodies calling to mind bands like Sevendust and Filter.Love it, and I'm sure it'll grow on me even more."
3,a tame film with a misleading title.,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.The film ""The Pornographers"" known in Japan as ""Jinruigaku Nyumon"" literally translates as ""Anthropology Introduction""While the movie is about a group who makes pornographic films, the movie itself is very tame in terms of the explicitness of the conduct portrayed. It would most likely get a PG-13 rating today. However there is a theme of incest which I think should be R-rated material.The story is about a group of men who make pornographic films for a living and to support his landlady's family. He is also trying to avoid the police and the Yakuza (Japanese mafia.) When he falls in love with his step-daughter things get out of hand.The DVD only has a theatrical trailer as a special feature which is disappointing as I thing that they could have added information on events surrounding th controversey of this film."
3,Ming Xia Is the man!!!!!!!,"OK, here it is. if you are buying this cd because you heard the song ""Things I've seen"" then save your money. This is by far the finest track featuring the angelic voice of Ming Xia. The rest of the CD is ok. If you have heard Ming Xia and you are enthralled by her voice as am I, just pray that the band breaks up quickly so that she can launch her solo career. If you are into hip hop, this is your album. It is very smoothe and refreshing. I am not a fan of hip hop, but I love this womans voice; it is truly spectacular."
3,Challenging but potentially engaging,"You will get to know some members of a small mining town in New Brunswick, all struggling to figure themselves out, find love, and place themselves in a difficult world.I had some trouble getting used to his unique style of writing - David Adams Richards writes as if observing his characters and describing their actions and thoughts as if he's from another land altogether. This was very distracting for me, and tended to take away my flow of reading. On the other hand, it was also challenging, in that it made me think about the characters and what their words and actions meant.The last 20-30 pages are by far the best of the entire novel and well worth the read."
1,what a waste of money,"I have bought this book thinking it would give information, beyond the most known facts and also instructions on how to deal with credit problems. I could fix little error on my credit history before reading this book. it is totally waste of money"
2,"old plot, sorry folks.","I have read only a couple chapters, but I am taking it back to the store. Her first few books were FANTASTIC, but save your time and money. This one is so predictable. Two people who grew up together, finally realize that the other is ""the one."" Just too common for such a marvelous author. Try again, Geralyn. You are so good."
2,Elevated or Elevator?,"The production values are good, the choice of material is unassailable, but there doesn't appear to be any intensity or freshness in these recordings. There's plenty of opportunity in Becker/Fagen's music for interpretation, improvisation and play, but I found almost every cut just too safe, disappearing into mere background music. This unfortunately leaves me wanting the originals rather than being engaged by the new interpretations. This isn't a tribute, because it lacks any passion. Even static raises an emotion. This doesn't even irritate. Listening or party music? No. At the Bar, Mall or Hotel, sure, why not. If you're not just the biggest SD fan, pass on this and get the real deal in a greatest hits compilation."
1,"Music for supermarkets, dentists, elevators","For those who might not know it, The Wave radio format was commercially developed by a large corporation. This CD will fit right in: soulless, formulaic saccharine for the mindless masses. Also available in drip-injection format for euthanasia."
1,Missing chapters,"The write up (and .99 cent price) convinced me to buy this book.... but the missing chapter kept me from pushing the purchase button. Sorry amazon, no sale"
1,not what I'd hoped for,"The charactors did not capture my attention. I did not find it funny, nor engaging, certainly not worth my time. The overview caption for the book was far more interesting and intriguing than the first few chapters I read before calling it quits."
2,I tried,"But this is too much like reading old Soviet era novels -- Sologub springs to mind -- where everything is a gloomy farcical tangle that means one thing, or maybe another thing. Whew."
1,good info but not useful / lacks depth,First the pages will fall out after reading it for a while. I felt the info didn't explain the subject at hand.
3,easy to read review,I enjoy the book but the binding fell apart when I was on page 60. This wont hold up in my toolbox
4,A Typically Victorian Erotic Novel,"Yet it stands out from all the other similar books by the sheer heat that radiates from the writing. Emily is promised in marriage to a man she does not desire, so she runs away and ends up at the house of an hospitable couple who engage in sexual daliances with their staff as well as guests. Emily and her sister decide to stay and do their best to keep Emily's finace away from her. (plot summary #10)This is a book worth reading if you can find it... hot eroticism in true victorian style!"
2,only a slight improvement above Kickboxer 4,"Kickboxer and/or Mark Dacascos fans may want to look elsewhere. While Kickboxer 5 is a bit better than the fourth, that's about it. There are a few good fight scenes halfway through the movie but then it goes downhill from there. Kickboxer 5 starts off with David Sloan getting murdered by some crimeboss in South Africa. Mark's character declares vengence (what a surprise!) and he goes off to find the crimeboss responsible for David's death with the help of an escaped convict. The final fight scene with Mark Dacascos and the crimeboss is just as ridiculous as the final fight scene in Kickboxer 4. As most direct to video films go, this one doesn't deliver overall so if you are one who wants to see the Kickboxer series than just stick with the first three movies. Trust me on this one!"
5,Extremely fun and entertaining,I didn't think much of this game when it first came out and then when I seen it for the price on Amazon I figured I'd give a try and glad I did. It was a very fun game to play and was very entertaining. I especially loved the slow down bullet time to get an accurate shot on an enemy and also the Max Payne type slown down to shot swarming enmeies. It was also nice that you don't have to take time to reload your weapons. The only gripe that I have was the lack of different weapons but that is a minor flaw!
3,Not worth it,This game looks like it was made back in 2000. This game does not even compare to any of the games made these past two years. The graphics are bad and the gameplay is terrible too.
5,Marty Redux,"This is one of the sweetest, most intelligent, authentic films of the decade: perfectly acted, beautifully directed. It's one of the first films I've seen in a long time that gives the story time to breathe. It's a pleasure to see the Sopranos cast giving this simple story their best attention. In a better world TWO FAMILY HOUSE would have gotten the Oscar. It's like MARTY but with more grit, and deserves a wide audience."
3,Some favorites on this one,"I do like her music, especially Only a Shadow. As far as worship music goes, I thoroughly enjoy it, but don't like to ""camp out"" on one song for too long. She does a nice job on this CD."
4,"great show""original thunderbirds""","great dvd of a show by the original thunderbirds,recently i went to a local free concert advertising the fabulous thunderbirds only to find out the band had different people,this dvd has the original line up,nice show. danny"
4,Good,"I had a problem with my roland hd 1, double note when you play hit hat and snare and others combinations , i read that this cable maybe could solve the problem, but the the problem continuous, i think is not the cable problem, is a problem with the v drums, maybe a recording interface with a real cable midi works fine, i give 4 stars beacause is a good service"
3,Great for overall tune-ups and troubleshooting,"Good diagrams and pictures, however not model specific. Detailed troubleshooting is difficult since book is geared to all models in these years. Great for finding part numbers, however I found 1 or 2 conflicting part #'s in the book."
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought this arm because it was very affordable and it's weight limit was well above the weight of my LCD. Out of the box one of the adjusting screws was so tight I twisted the metal wrench included trying to loosen it and stripped out the screw head when I tried loosening it with a power screwdriver. It was still usable so I decided to keep itAfter only 2 weeks of use it could no longer sustain the weight of my LCD screen no matter how much I tightened it, and my screen is is a full 5 pounds less than the advertised weight limit!!"
2,solid but useless,"I bought this arm extension to be able to adjust the monitor in a proper position and to move it out of my way if I don't need it. The device is made out of solid metal and looks nice. However if you are planing to have an arm extension that allows you to move the monitor around, this is not for you. I think it is intend to be in a fixed position and then it is fine.For me it is not working. After a half week of using this extension moving the monitor in and out my way several times the day the screws are getting more and more loose and it's just a matter of time till this thing falls apart.Also one of the plastic cable fixer broke the very first day. Regarding the extension height, I had set it to max to adjust it properly to my height. I mounted this device on my desk."
4,Exactly what I needed,This arm was exactly what I needed. It came pre-assmebled and all I had to do was connect it to my desk and monitor. It allows me to move my monitor with ease anywhere I prefer.
5,Love it!,My husbands loves this! It saves him desk top space. He plans to get a second one for his second monitor soon.
4,Excellent Product,"This is an incredibly well-built product. There are two minor issues: (1) one of the aesthetic coverings at a major joint is glued on and mine came off and (2) flexibility of the major joint is limited. Other than that, this holds a monitor well and looks wonderful."
4,Terrific and well constructed,"I looked at a number of support arms for my monitor but went with this one because it both elevates and extends the monitor forward and back. Very well made, heavy construction, and feels very sturdy. I wish it could move without having to loosen and then retighten things but I couldn't find one that would do that. I had hoped to find one that moved like a spring arm lamp but couldn't. This as as close as I came and it is very good."
2,Won't go low enough to use for notebook PC,Only 2 stars because will not work as a laptop stand with the Neo-flex laptop holder.I have other Neo-Flex products. They have great quality. But this one will not articulate low enough to use with a notebook PC. But it would probably be good for use with a monitor.
2,Petty Sniping,"The author has an axe to grind. This is a petty analysis of John Paul's term. Cornwell is looking for fault with everything the Pope has done. He starts from that premise. The Pope did or said this. How can I find fault?I suspect the petty sniping comes from the author's fundamental issues with papal infallibility. Cornwell seems to be under some delusion that the doctrines of the faith should be openly debated rather than derive their authority from 2000 years of collected prayer, reflection and study."
1,SPEWING FORTH,This book is a hateful diatribe. I cannot help but wonder what the author was thinking in writing this book. It was not worth my time or my money.
5,You MUST see this film to get to the TRUTH!,"This film really shows the true Tammy Faye Bakker. She lets go of her guard to explain what happened to her and her ex-husband during the TBN scandal.She shows her sensitivity and vulnerability in this documentary. This is not any boring documentary. It is engaging and honest.You owe it to yourself to see this film! Find out what kind of Christians Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and the Crouches REALLY are! You've judged her before. Now you can take back everything you ever thought about her. I did."
3,It's a good book for a laugh or two.,"This book is NOT a ""how to"" guide for guys, but that's not what I expected anyway based on the previous reviews. This book is meant to be a joke, and it's funny because it is based on elements of truth. It pokes fun at both the tendency of women to desire jerks as well as the tendency for ""nice guys"" to be complete saps. Unfortunately, some of the humor is overdone and/or of poor quality. So, it's good, but it's not great."
3,Grand Mom's IDE and SCSI?,"Because of the rapidly revised specification and tons of legacy issues, it's not easy for a book to cover the latest technologies as well as the former ones. This book isn't quite up to date especially in IDE. If you want to know what is UDMA or Tailgate, they are not in this book.For a beginner that is about to implement devices or program drivers, this book should be a good entry, but not enough. If you have already know how hard drives work, save your money and download the newest spec."
3,Worth a look for fans of off-beat cinema,"The film is strange...it's best to watch it having no concept of what's going to happen, so I'm certainly not going to spill the beans, suffice to say it's a film sure to attract a cult following."
1,A worthy and kind FICTIONAL interpretation of an account.,"What goes against my conviction of her account is her ability to remember such precise and defined details years after it actually happened. How many of us can remember what we dreamed last week, or last night for that matter? And, how conscious are we of that experience - whether it were reality or a creation of the conditioned mind? Her interpretation was too detailed, but again, most importantly, too consciously focused to be dismised as an unconscious creation of the mind.I'm sure she meant well by painting a picture of the afterlife for people who have lost loved ones in the past. But credibility of remembrance of details after such a long time - and - with the conscious of the unconscious is just not believable in the reality of mind.Read this fictional account for entertainment, but don't believe everything you read; just like this post. Make up your own mind.In the end, it is really just a question of faith in her experience."
3,Not What I Was Expecting,"Despite the generally good reviews, I found that while it was a very easy read, it seemed to unreal to me. Of course, I have never had a near death experience, so take it for what its worth. Some may find great comfort in it, and for those, I'm happy. For me, it did not quite provide the answers or the comfort I was looking for. The search goes on."
5,Love this book...,"GREAT book!! Warms the heart, lifts the spirit, good for EVERYONE. I bought a copy to share, and one to keep (after not getting the first copy back when I loaned it out). My copy is for me to underline and highlight the things I want to remember the most."
1,Creative embelishment,"I had hoped to find the words of a fellow experiencer, when I found this book. I was so saddened when I found what this woman wrote. It was a mish-mosh of beliefs + Mormon folklore. I wept with saddness because she has no idea of the impacts of her creative storytelling on honest, sincere, searching souls or she would not have written this. If one wants to know about really connecting, I would recomment searching elsewhere (an honorable source is a three time fellow tunnel traveler P.M.H. Atwater) I had so hoped that this book would have helped the world remember the Christ love, as it really is."
5,"Great, Great Book!","Everyone should read this book! I can't keep them around...someone either needs to read it or WANTS to read it! It is the most comforting thing for someone that has lost a loved one...or even a pet! (They DO go to Heaven!) You will never fear passing from this world after reading this book! Please, Please, Read it!"
3,Embraced,Ok I thought this would be more informative but end up being more like a story about what happened to her. Still ok but was looking for a book more like Courageous souls
1,"Embraced by the ""light"" of Mormonism","For those who have been embraced by the ""light"" of Betty Eadie's ""experiences"", I urge you to take a close, critical look at the theology/cult of Mormonism and you will see her ""visions"" in a very different ""light""."
1,"Embellished, At Best","I have read EVERYTHING I can get my hands on about the life after this one, and feel that, after years of study, I know it as well as I can without actually experiencing it myself, but this one just didn't mesh with all the others. I'm not saying that the author didn't have an experience; I am saying that I feel very strongly that her story is GREATLY embellished for entertainment value--and very entertaining it is. However, I feel that having an especially sacred experience such as this is treated as such by those who have such an honor, and not exploited. Yes, these experiences are shared and written, but carefully and guarded. Like I said, this book was very entertaining, but from someone who has studied the topic for years--it just didn't ""scrub"". I wouldn't recommend it, except as an easy, fictional read."
1,Read the Book but....,I read both books by Betty Eadie. I really fell for the first one-Embraced by the Light-until I read the second book. I felt like I fool. I realized I had been totally duped by her. I don't recommend either book. I think it's all a fake.
3,"Flimsy, uncoated cards","I would categorize these cards as ""for mediation only; not reading."" For the simple reason that after 100 shuffles, there would probably be nothing left of them. Surprising for U. S. Games."
5,Ethiopian history,"I have not read this yet, but have heard about it. We are glad to find any product that can help us understand our children's Ethiopian history and share with them as they get older."
2,Sophomore Jinx,"This CD is so disappointing. I thought it was going to be alot better. There is only a few good songs and way to many filler. Thug Mentality is so much better. Know I am thinking of a way to sell this. If you don't want to be disappointed, DON'T BUY THIS."
3,Yea man Krayzie Cd is ight!,"I'm sayin off da back it's not a good follow up from Thugmentality cuz it was an all around album and this album is bascially jus an soft side of Krayzie and he got to many sorry kneight riduz on the cd and that sond ""Keight riduz wuz here"" is corny jus like the one on Thug Mentatlity. ""Time after time"" is denfityly tight and ""Hard time huslting"" 19 is tight even though it's to short nah sayin but bone fans pick it up anyway if it was a double cd dis sorry i would say it's not worth it but it's good enuff to go scoop up"
5,Krayzie and his crew are Krayzie hot!,"Krayzie Bone is simply incredible. The hits just don't stop! His voice, style, abilities, creativity, etc., are exceptional. This is a fabulous work of art. Krayzie has his own unique sound that you know is not copied. He sends out some positive messages and doesn't boast about being better than anyone else or being ""the greatest"" unlike a lot of rapper/MCs out there. Now that's a smart man. He knows there is other talent besides himself. And his crew rocks the house too. This is easily one of my favortie cds. The beats, rythms, and all the accompaniment are polished and accomplished, like the sound of a true music veteran. It is a mature, well-grounded and established sound. There is nothing weak about it. Krayzie and crew, EXCELLENT WORK! IT IS FANTASTIC! And thank-you greatly for a clean/edited version."
3,I just watched this on cinemax,"It was okay. Cute in some parts. I even chuckled a little. But I wasn't expecting much. And not much is what I got. I did however enjoy the end. If you're bored on a friday night, I'd recommend watching this movie."
2,Occasional fun... but it tries way too hard,"This movie had a very fun idea for a plot. And it wasn't the outlandish proportions that made it unenjoyable. It was that the lines were unoriginal, the plot highly predictable in an annoying way, and the ending far to fast and cheesy. All the actors tried too hard to be funny, although Fonda was certainly the more experienced one, occasionally delivering humorous scenes. The cliches were the most grating thing about the movie. The excentric gay friend. The nasty and aggressive blonde who loves the leading man. The hot doctor who is over the top cheesy (NO guy could EVER describe a girl's eyes like that). The sassy african-american assistant (think Miss Congeniality 2 but not as funny). But J-Lo is beautiful and sports many cute outfits, and her leading man isn't at all hard to look at - thats one star. The second? The one scene where I actually DID laugh, when Fonda tries to put nuts in Lopez's food and gets in a fight with her assistant."
1,ABSOLUTLEY THE WORST,"this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. No one in their right mind would think this movie was even acceptable. Not only is the ""Mother"" completely crazy and needing of mental health but J Lo just can't act. If you want a complete was of a couple hours of ur life.. then watch this movie."
2,Spoilt by over the top performances,"I liked the idea surrounding this film before I saw it. However, after viewing it there are so many problems with this film that I am surprised they even bothered releasing it. It could have done with more test audiences beforehand perhaps to get it right.The first problem is the unconvincing and too fast relationship between Lopez and her boyfriend. There is nothing special enough between them to believe that they could get together that fast and move in together.The second big problem is the embarrassing overacting from Jane Fonda. Frankly, Jane should have known better, and avoided this film at all costs. No mother in law would carry on the way she has. I realise this is supposed to be a comedy of sorts, but her weird performance was uncalled for.The third big problem is that the viewer does not care for any of the characters.A huge disappointment! Why does Lopez keep getting offered roles? BIzarre."
1,Never received the DVD Monster in Law,"I don't understand why we haven't received this DVD yet. We ordered it May 17th '09. No correspondence what so ever, after repeatedly sending inquiries as where the DVD is. We were also charged, and have nothing to show for it. I can't even bring myself to give a one star rating. Very poor customer service.Darlene Rosalie"
1,Wanda Sykes is the ONLY good thing about this movie,"My wife wanted to rent this movie, so my review is written on her behalf.According to her, the ONLY time she ever laughed or chuckled thru the whole film was when Wanda Sykes (RUBY) was on the screen.Everything else was a drag !So Wanda Sykes was a five (5)The rest of the film was FLAT, FLAT, FLAT !My wife kept yelling at the screen...... ""Where is the humor, where is the comedy ?"""
5,Watch this movie,"dont listen to these other people watch this movie. This movie is funny. J-lo has to meet her boyfriends mom who is a whack job, i think everyone has been there, where someones mom didnt like something you done. Whether is was she didnt like the way you cleaned or something. I thought this movie was lol funny"
5,JENNIFER AND JANE MADE THE MOVIE!!!!!!!!,"When i saw Monster in Law what can i say,but funny,funny, and of course funny!!!!!! Jennifer Lopez meets the man of her dreams one day on the beach and then she meets his mother played by Jane Fonda!!!!!! Jane and Jennifer made this movie and if you haven't seen it yet then you really need to!!!!!! For all your dvd movie buffs this movie is a must comedy in any dvd collection!!!!!!"
3,Better than I thought,"Monster in Law is better than I thought it would be. There are funny moments (mainly with Sykes), and Fonda has some good moments. Even Lopez who I hate is managable in this movie."
5,Hilarious!,"Look, I`m not a comedy guy. I love movies in general, but comedies is the one genre I usually stay away from. However, this movie, along with Ghost, made me laugh my behind off. Jane Fonda is a riot. And what about Wanda Sykes? She`s a gem. I bought this DVD and have watched it over and over and I have a blast every time. Even Jennifer Lopez is good in it. Highly recommended."
2,Not Great...,"I think the plot of this movie is okay, and it is predictable like another reviewer alread said. Anyway, one thing i notice about this movie that i highly dislike was Jennifer Lopez's acting skill (i mean I will give her credit for trying), but i don't think she can act (not in this movie or Gigli). I think this movie would of been funnier if Sandra bullock or someone plays Charlize."
4,Hilarious,"If you need a light , big hearted movie, please see this. I wasn't expecting a lot, but I was very happy with what I got. Also I must say that Jane Fonda really absolutely had me amazed, she had perfect comedic timing, excellent movie!"
5,Hilarious,"I had no intentions of going to see this movie at the show nor was I going to rent it. It looked corny. I couldn't have been more wrong. I borrowed the movie from my mother and cried laughing, especially with the mother's hair sticking up in the middle of her head. I'm laughing now while I type this e-mail. That was the craziest movie about a very COLORFUL mother and a very SWEET, SPACEY woman who both love the same man. Some of the tricks they pulled were great and Wanda Sykes definitely complimented the movie."
4,Funny and cute,"I loved it. I wasn't sure what type of romantic comedy this one was but I am glad I watched it. This movie is not your typical cheesy chick movie. It actually has a good point to it.So you got my review, now you tell me... what the heck happened with Jennifer Lopez's hair in this film? Looks awful."
1,"AWFUL, JUST AWFUL !","This movie is just as bad as you've probably heard. After decades out of movies, this is the best Jane Fonda could get ?!?!? J-Lo shows no talent and ultimately, not even the good looks you'd expect from a Hollywood superstar.My in-laws invited me to watch this movie and, well, I may never forgive them !"
4,Good Film,This was a truely good enjoyable film. Jane Fonda and Jennifer Lopez held their own with a lukewarm script. The groom seemed more like a prop than a character and the women's antics did get a little outrageous...but it was all in good fun. I agree with other reviewers: Wanda Sykes had the best lines and managed to steal a few scenes from the great Ms. Fonda. All in all a good rental.
3,predictable fluff,"This film was at least entertaining. I had some misgivings about patronizing a film featuring Hanoi Jane, but went anyway.The male lead sported a three day growth of stubble throughout the film, which is somewhat improbable for a Doctor, not to mention a bit difficult to maintain.J-lo was her usual radiant self, and you have to give Fonda credit for having the guts to allow so much of her sixty year old body to be displayed on the screen."
1,Horrible movie!,"First of all, let me say how happy I was not to pay for this movie. It is horrible! The script laughable. People did not say ""hi"" in mid 18th century Turkey. I could write a better script. This movie was so bad, I fast-forwarded it to the end, couldn't stand to watch the whole thing. The costumes were silly and looked like something you could by at K-Mart. Which is a shame, because this could have been a great movie. Aimee's story deserves so much better than this. Also, why was this rated ""R?"" No erotcism, no nudity, no chemistry between the actors. Do yourself a favor and skip this in favor of ""Kama Sutra; A Tale of Love."""
2,"Lame entry in the ""harem"" genre","Intimate Power is quite simply a waste of film. While the sets and costumes were appropriate, the two principals simply have zero on screen chemistry. Abraham is seemingly too young looking for the part of the sultan. And Amber O'Shea seems absolutley terrified of baring her body. Come on this is an R rated film. The whole purpose of her being sold into sexual slavery, is to have sex. The love scene in the movie is beyond lame. I have seen more eroticism on the morning soaps. The rest of the movie moves very slowly. Omar Sharif and perhaps Heather Locklear would have been better cast as the two leads. Someday someone is going to tell this story right."
2,chevy emblem,"I had ordered the chevy emblem, but sorry to say I purchased the wrong emblem, I needed a smaller emblem for my car. I returned it with no problem, and was refunded my money. Thank you, Millie Durgan"
2,Another Liberal Manifesto,"Conservatives will probably dislike it. Liberals will find it a good, fresh rally 'round the liberal flagpole. I'm a liberal, so it was fun for me. But have you noticed how the word ""community"" is becoming the new flashword among liberals? ""We are all in this together,"" says Mario, so we had better take care of ourselves. Like Hillary Clinton's ""It Takes a Village."" The use of ""community"" is like the use of ""opportunity"" by the conservatives. Both are code words for points of view that, taken to their extremes, can be far more detrimental than helpful. Americans ultimately prefer the middle. Just remember that, folks, and no one will get hurt."
2,Skechers Loafer,The shoe itself is very stylish. I thought they were a little narrow and would break in. I was wrong. They are a little tight but more annoying is that they squeak when you walk. It started after 2 weeks of wear.
2,Disappointing,"Hyboria's Fiercest (and the other's in these series) are basically divided into three parts:Guidelins to describing stereotypical character's for the classes broken down by each race. It contains some specific rules. This part is pretty useful, especially if you're not immersed in Conan-lore.Special rules and feats. This part is useful, but hardly essential to playing the game.Cross-classes for Barbarians, Borderers and Nomads. As far as I can see these cross-classes are pretty weak, given how flexible Conan is about switiching classes as you progress. All the cross-classes are worse than you could achieve by multi-classing freely.While the book contains some good stuff for playing the game, I don't think it's worth the money."
5,Inspiration for Creativity,"In an age of ready made entertainment where children are taught to be couch potatoes, here is a book that will inspire them to new heights of creative (and active) play. The children in this book have taken what materials were at hand and created a magical world of their own making in which to spend the long summer days. My own children loved the book."
1,Book is not well researched,"Although this book is easy to read and understand, there is a plethera of incorrect information about various breeds in the book. It is quite obvious that the author either did little to no research of the breeds or wrote about personal experience with a very small sampling (perhaps only one) of dogs in the breed.[...]"
1,Breed prejudice...,"I recently acquired the book ""The Good, the Bad and the Furry."" I was very surprised at some of the things Stall said:American Staffordshire Terrier""Poorly bred AmStaffs (including their no-good, half-breed cousin the pit bull)...""""But do you really want your kids' best buddy to be a bear trap with legs? Get the family a Labrador retriever instead.""Doberman""A well-trained Doberman can be a devoted friend - a friend who's indifferent to physical pain...""I read these things and immediately wanted to shred the book.I have worked for various animal shelters and run my own dog rescue. If Stall knew anything about dogs,he would know that not all of the breeds that get a bad rap act as he says they do. People like Sam Stall are the reason that there is breed prejudice.What an idiot..."
3,Fascinating flashback,"If you like your documentaries raw, this one is for you. The telling of a seminal time in the history of gay culture very wisely resists a flash and sizzle style that could so easily have led this down the wrong path. Instead you have a good balance of interviews and flashback archival footage. The interviews are pretty much exclusive to the rare few who were actually there and are still here to tell the tale, recounting a time that helped define what the word liberation meant to thousands of gay men during the heyday of Gay Liberation. Sandwhiched between the repression of pre-Stonewall 60's and the devastation of the AIDS crisis in the 80's, this is a great look at a halcyon period in our history with multiple repercussions which will still be felt in decades to come."
4,JL Ponty Jazz Violin,"When I think about my ""younger days"" in college during the early 70's I often remember what music I was discovering. Going to Austin was a big change from the small high school I graduated from. Music was the revelation that influenced my life from that point on, specifically modern jazz (Al Dimeola,Weather Report, Stanley Clarke ) and Jean Luc Ponty. I had not heard this music and specifically the ""Aurora"" album for over 25 years. Thanks to Amazon.com I was reunited with JLP about a week ago and I was in a time travel-like state back to my college days. Thank you Amazon.com for helping me remember one of the most happy times of my life!"
1,TINY!,"This coffee press looks like a childs toy! i dont understand how it was ever named a 3-cup press. It looks fine for backpacking, but would not work for any more than 1 person!"
3,Hand Wash,"This product is okay as a starter press if you only plan on making coffee for one, occasionally, and are very gentle with it. The glass is very thin and although the product says it is dishwasher safe, it did not look the same after the first wash and cracked on the second.Since I paid almost $20 for it and used it twice I contacted the company and asked for a replacement. They sent the glass beaker only. Since the base and handle are all one piece, getting the broken glass out without losing a finger was tricky. Getting the new glass in without breaking it was also not easy.I still use the press and it does make very good coffee, but will probably look at buying a larger, hopefully higher quality, model. If you buy this product I would definitely recommend hand washing it."
1,Not what I ordered,I orderded this item and was sent a smaller version which holds approximately 1 1/2 cups max. I purchased it as a gift and failed to check it was the correct item until 30days had elapsed. I now am finding no method to even contact a live person to request a partial refund or exchange.
3,Size is important!,"The French press works as advertised, but I was caught off guard by the size. Most coffee cans tout 6 0z. cups, so a 3 cup press should just about fill our mug. Surprized to find that these were 4 oz. cups, so doesn't quite make a full mug."
3,smaller then you think,"functionality wise, this is a great product. 3 cups translates to literally one mug full of coffee. This thing is much smaller then it looks. Its a personal one cup of coffee, if thats what you are looking for then buy this."
4,Excelelnt product!,"I did some research on Uniden phones and chose this one... The only thing I don't like is there is no universal delete button for caller I.D. To erase them I have to manually delete them from both phones. Besides that, no problems what so ever!"
4,Great phone!,"Pros:Clear sound,easy to use,lots of featuresCons:Base phone ringer overpowers handset ring."
2,Be careful of static electricity,"I live in an area of the country that has very low humidity during the winter and so there is a great deal of static electricity. I have owned this phone for about a year and now that winter is here I am noticing a major engineering flaw and that is with static shocks. Even if the handset is in the base unit, any static shock will cause the handset to perform either a complete power-on reset or just interfere with the connection enough so that I cannot answer the phone and miss the call. I have tried to remove the built up static charge on myself before touching the phone but that doesn't work all of the time. No other device I own does this. Perhaps the next model will perform better in this regard?"
4,Good phones,"I bought these because I needed a true 5.8 transmission to stop interference with my wLan and microwave. It eliminated my problems, however, these phones have more of an echoey sound to them. The handsets are a little larger than my old uniden 2.4 set. Also, the belt clips actually help act as a neck support when talking without a headset. My range seems to be decent, I have a 1800 sq ft, 2.5 story house and have had no problems. Overall a decent phone."
3,"Good system, but range is limited","I bought this as a replacement for a Panasonic system that went through batteries faster than I was willing to replace.A selling point for me was that you can connect up to 10 phones to the system (although only 2 at a time can be active on a call). Very convenient for houses with multiple ""living"" areas, and studies; as you don't have to continually run to get to the phone that always seems to be on the other side of the house!The phones work well, and I like the features, but the range of the handsets is somewhat limited - more in some parts of the house than in others (of equal distance from the base unit). I often experience dropouts from the conversations when in my study."
5,"so far, its all good","After an exhaustive search and a horrible experience with the much lauded and very disappointing Vtech I5871 (looks cool, bad reception, died completely a convenient 1 year and 1 month [read: 30 days outside of warranty coverage] after purchase for no apparent reason!) I finally settled on this model of Uniden. So far, its worked like a charm and has great reception on all 3 levels of my house. The second handset has been bug-free and the sound quality is great. Highly recommended!"
1,"Defective LED light on main base, Poor replacement policy","The first day after receiving this phone, the LED light on the main base went out,therefore the handset was not charging. After contacting Uniden, they said to exchange the two handsets between the two base units, wait a couple of days and if the light still goes out for no reason, to call them back. Well, it happened 3 more times and so I called them. They said that they would replace the base unit only after me faxing them the original bill and charging me a $10 shipping fee. Also they informed me that the replacement base would not be a new unit but a refurbished one, even though what I ordered was brand new. This is an unacceptable way to handle a defective product, by penalizing the customer. I can only hope that the replacement will work correctly."
3,uniden phone,"I love the phone but have had a lot of trouble finding batteries for it. The base unit doesn't come with a battery, you only get batteries for the two handsets. I tried many places and nobody carried them. Uniden's web site also didn't have any."
2,VOICEMAIL,THIS UNIT DOES NOT HAVE AN ANSWERING SYSTEM--YOU NEED TO HAVE VOICE MAIL--MY 85 YR OLD MOTHER CANNOT USE THIS--WHAT CAN WE DO??
4,Roses are Red!!,"Serrani or Icilyn's (same author) book was very good. This was my second book by her and she really lived up to her work. If you liked this one you might want to read about Kendra's troubled little sister in ""Violets are Blue."" If you get confused like I did she did that novel along with another book called ""Island Romace"" by the name of Sonia Icilyn. Enjoy!!"
4,Read the first half only,Gripping first half of the book. A dramatic look into the origins of Soviet cardiac surgery -- Amosoff was a general surgeon who learned how to perform open heart surgery on his own using cadavers and hopeless patients. The book provides a great insight into the tension and the uncertainty behind the facade of one of the premier Soviet surgeons. The theorizing on cybernetics in the second half of the book was rather dull and disappointing but obviously very interesting to the author.
5,Ce much better than the original,I know this game has been beaten up from the beginning and i feel dreamcatcher totally mishandled the release and response to the consumers. I decided to give the Ce a try and have had a good time playing this game. It still has some bugs but nothing to really take away from the game. This game had alot of potential and sadly was not given the time to be developed. I feel this game should be given another chance for anyone looking to by the CE edition only. I hope the expansion packand Dungeon Lords 2 will be handled differently and that Bradley will make sure these games are not released before they are perfected
2,Starts good but palls quickly,"So I made the mistake of buying this game without checking it out first. Big mistake. It does start out good with an interesting storyline, but after running around the bland repetitive country side and running into the 58th random encounter and listening to the bad acting and watching the painted on armor instead of it being modeled, well, it just gets really old. I didn't try the original one, so I can't compare it with this version, but from what I've read, it's even worse than this. If you want a really good RPG, try Gothic. That one is Awesome! This one is...well...boring."
3,constant fighting,"This game, like the game sacred spawns monsters like crazy. Seems like you're fighting almost all the time. Sometimes I can't even go anywhere on the map and have to spend 5-10 minutes fighting new monsters that keep on popping up in one area. Luckily, you usually have plenty of healing potions on your. You probably want to read the on-line walkthough if you take this game seriously. This game doesn't do a good job of where you are supposed to go sometimes."
4,SSshhhAAAaaZZZzzzzAAAaaaMMMmmm!!!,"My My My.... this game has captured my senses... well done fighting system! I had purchased the CE a while back (Like 3 months ago)... stuck it on the shelf after not getting much into it. I thought the AI was pretty lame and the spawning baddies system was just plain whacked.... but the more I got into it, gaining experience, and also deciding to upgrade my video card..... whoaaa.... now this is impressive technology! Yeah, bugs are around and soooo many things can be better but the possibilities are wonderous! Bravo! I come from an IT background among other ventures, like film making, and I got to say hats off to the designers for making my keyboard and mouse sing to me like this! Control your camera, ya Dungeon Lords, ya mesmerized freaks!!!! Slash, dodge, magic blast, suck on a drink cause you knows your health will be off towards the pink!"
1,"of limited value, authentic or not","This book is definitely old school. Most of it features very simple cooking very heavy on egg, sour cream, butter and/or meat. If you eat this way or would like to, you probably don't need this cookbook to tell you how to do it! Venturing away from these types of dishes, for a number of the recipes the instructions and/or ingredient amounts don't really make sense or don't include enough detail. Proceed with caution and use your common sense. (I think some things got lost in translation--through time, place and/or language.) There are a few interesting ideas and combinations, some of them more appealing than others. e.g. Beets with cloves worked for me. Potato with prunes, and kidney beans with poppy seeds not so much. Are the recipes ""authentic""? I wouldn't know, and the book offers no supporting information. Either way, I think the book requires far too much filtering and deciphering to be of much use, however."
5,Applause for love!,"I had read Gilbert Adair's novel of ""Love and Death on Long Island"" a few years ago and was so impressed that I not only introduced it to my Book Group but also wrote to the man himself. He agreed that a writer's audience is so far away from the writer that he never hears even the echo of the applause. I was unsure whether this tender love story would transfer to the cinema having seen so many travesties recently of good books brought to the screen. I was wrong to worry as the sensitivity of the director and the two key actors, John Hurt and Jason Preistley brought more than just visual representation to the book they found a way of showing love on the screen between two men that was neither salacious nor mocking. I can not rate this movie too highly - it has the strength of theatre combined with the magic of film. Watch and enjoy"
3,Not the first book you should read on Madison,"This book is not for someone who is looking for a little light reading on the Father of the Constitution. Ketchum has written an incredibly detailed book with tons of information on our smallest president. However, the book is quite dull. Ketchum writes it in such a way that the books seems to drag on. The information is interesting but Ketchum seems to take too much time examining things during Madison's life that really aren't that important.If you want a book that attacks you with information on Madison, this is your book. If you are looking for something fun to read, find another book."
1,Terrible,What multiple artists? The orchestra? There is one singer for most/all songs and he is no great shakes...only good point is that some of these songs seem unavailable elsewhere..
5,Pretty good.,"Good documented book in very good shape. Looks like new. Not outdated, because it gives tendencies and political remarks. Passed through my son in the States to Belgium."
5,Extremely Fun Cult Classic,"Island Warriors is an incredible movie... not because it's good... but because it's fun.It starts before you even get it out of the box. Those two guys fighting on the cover? Yeah - They're not in the movie... Those four guys fighting on the back cover? Not in the movie either...This is a movie where everything is 'over the top' - from looped kung-fu jump kicks, costumes, sets, plywood pirate ships, and even acting.... and especially the giant naked statue.This is not a low budget flick with a small cast. This is a lot of people spending a lot of time and money making a bad movie as best they can. Interestingly the script actually holds together better than many movies, and all of the basic questions you would have about an island populated by women kung-fu masters are addressed.Some of the things that make this movie great are the sexist comments that fly both ways making it a fun flick for couples."
1,Dissssapointing,"This cd is not good. I bought it as an add on to get free shipping, but I should have just paid for my shipping. It's got a ton of songs on it - unfortunately I haven't found a good one yet. I used to be a hiero fan and now I think that era is over."
1,Garbage,"I just received my 622 about 2 weeks ago and the HDMI died already and this is Dec 2009. Please don't comment that receiver is good if you have no experience with the HDMI port. At first the picture will drop out for a second every now and then and you pay it no mind because you think it's the broadcast station. The next time you turn it on there's no picture. The componant side works but I want to use the HDMI.In short, 4 years since this problem started it's still happening. Don't get this receiver."
1,BEWARE: Refurbished units sold as NEW by Dish Network,"If you are ordering this receiver from Dish Network, beware that they are selling refurbished units as NEW units without telling customers. I confirmed this today after spending 2 hours on the phone with their tech support. While pokeing around in the back checking connections per their support person, I noticed a sticker that said ""Remanufactured."" I asked why their installer gave me a reman receiver instead of New like I was told when ordering their service. Their answer? ""When we run low on New stock we just give people Refurbished units."" WHAT? Without even telling them? YEP! I have had this receiver for a week and it has worked a total of 3 hours in that time. JUNK!"
4,So Far So Good,"I was concerned about getting this unit based on other's negative experiences, but after a month of use I would say I am a satisfied customer. As with any hard drive you have your occasional glitches, but fortunately it's rare enough to not interfere with the viewing pleasure.I did have to disconnect the UHF antenna in the back and reprogram my remote because the thing was picking up stray signals from the next town. For a while I thought the unit had a mind of its own changing channels, turning off and on and recording random shows at will. Problem was easily fixed. Being able to record HD shows is what I like best with this unit.Hopefully it will hold up with as hot as it runs, but so far so good even during the summer heat. I keep it off when I am not using it."
1,non-responsive seller,"I placed an order for a DISH Network ViP622 DVR on December 14, 2010 and have not received the merchandise as of January 21,2011. I would have thought the order would have been fulfilled by now. I have attempted to contact the seller on 2 separate occasions to determine status of the order but have not received a response. My credit card has been charged so I will file a claim in 3 business days if I do not receive a response.At this point I would definitely not recommend this seller. Amazon will be alerted so the seller's star rating can be lowered and/or request the seller be removed from their list."
1,UMVD...,"...must stand for ""Useless Marred & Vandalized Dvd"". Botching studios who are mistaking 'Fool Screen' for 'Full release' should get some attention from those who like to be regarded as the protectors for the Intellecual & Artistic Property. Full Screen without any other option should be treated as a violation of this Property!!!!!Of course, the '1 star' (should be less than 0) is only for the studio's crap, not for the movie itself."
4,Light and Entertaining,"Good, clean and entertainig comedy. Pretty typical Alan Alda in a comedic role. Lillian Gish is outstanding"
3,Some endearing moments,"Don't let the Marx Brothers-look of the SWEET LIBERTY poster (Writer/Director/Star Alan Alda with his pants off) fool you. SWEET LIBERTY's more endearing moments feature Alda, playing a history writer whose book is to be a motion picture, interacting with the Hollywood people he meets. Michelle Pfeiffer and the great Michael Caine shine as the actors; Bob Hoskins, as the screen writer, and Saul Rubinek, as the director, light up the screen as well. Extra credit to Alda for not writing his part as the total good guy; you will see what I mean when our small-town history buff tries to play a romantic lead."
3,Needed to be more direct.,"I read this book in 1997 and as I recall it was very informative. Lots of illustrations, notes, and an indepth bibliography. However it may be a deep read for someone not use to the subject matter."
2,Adequate,Ok guide. Kind of boring with not a lot of high-quality visuals. Bad sound too. All the other reviews sound like they were written by the company that makes them.
1,Pretty Cool,"Not really that interesting, there are no actual ""climbing"" shots at all, it's mostly a mish mosh of approach footage and a small amount of slogging on a glacier.BORING!"
3,"Awakening Young Minds, Perspectives on Education",I am a college student who chose this book for a report. I did not enjoy this book as much as I thought I would. The title really pulls you in while the chapters someone let you down. There are fourteen chapters of many professionals ideological beliefs of education. My favorite chapter was by John Taylor Gatto who told about the nine myths of schooling. Along with these myths are twenty-one facts that are very helpful. Each chapter gives an opinion of these professionals and their views on education.
5,Hours of Fun,"I bought this for my grandson's 6th birthday. Even though he does not read, he was able to follow the instructions for building the castle by looking at the pictures and diagrams. He needed a little help at times in identifying pieces by their length. Since I have read the first two Harry Potter books to him, he was very interested in the Lego castle. He spent two days engrossed in the building of the castle. There were many small details that made the castle worth the extra cost, and the figures of the Harry Potter character's were also a plus. After it was together, he really didn't do much with it, but the assembly, for him, made this his favorite gift."
2,Very dry book,"Not satisfied, very simple sketches, it is more like refresher book with all latin names. No concepts, no functions, no color, no shading,"
4,"Superb Errol Morris film, more than about Capitol Punishment","Yankee Tinkerer Fred A. Leuchter, Jr., whowas the number one manufacturer of executionequipment, stumbled upon something more thanhe bargained for when the courts in Torontohad him go to Poland and take samples of thealledged 'gas chambers' at the Osweiseim StateMuseum (formerly known as Auschwitz during WWII).The world finally got to see Historical Revision-ists for what they are; normal people taking an-other look at historical epochs and giving a moresensible opinion about them. There were no 'gaschambers', folkes. This is a very bitter pill forsome to swallow, but the truth hurts. Thanks,Fred!"
3,HDMI connection issue with satellite HD boxes,"The HDMI connection issue isn't limited to DirectTV receivers. I just got the top of the line Dish Network HD receiver and I get the same ""unsupported video format"" problem and the cyclical picture drops (.5 second picture then black screen - repeats over and over). I reported this to Philips tech support and they said to use the component video connections. I told the guy I already am, that is how I can see any kind of picture at all... just wanted them to be aware this is more widespread problem than they think (their FAQ's page for this TV indicates it is for a particular DirectTV receiver - not the case).Other than that, I like the TV a lot - very good picture, sound quality in stereo mode is good (I didn't care for the surround sound option)."
2,Decent picture but doesn't work well,"Decent picture as long as you're not trying to see it via DirectTV's HDMI. We have DirectTV and tried to hook this unit up via HDMI cable but, like one of other reviewers said, we keep getting ""Unsupported Video Format"" for this. I talked to a manager at Philips and he said this was a compatibility issue with the DirectTV. However, when googling this issue it only comes up with this TV as a problem. If this was a compatibility issue why don't other TVs have the same problem?So, all in all , two stars..."
4,ok,"I was a little concerned at first because I had heard several mixed reviews, but I haven't had any problems with it in my Dell Axim x51v."
3,A mediocre book.,"I used this book in studying for the AP US History exam. It really did not cover everything I needed to know for the exam, so I probably got a 3 or 4 on it. Overall, I guess I would say that the review in the book was too basic. The multiple choice practice exams were too easy. Also, my teacher told us that the College Board was creating more and more DBQs that were based on culture (and the Exam's DBQ this year was about women's culture from the post-American Revolution to the beginning of the Civil War), but this book didn't really reflect that change with its practice and test DBQs.I guess this book's alright if you'll accept a 3 or 4 on the exam, which was alright for me."
2,Good music bad vocals,"I bought this CD because I wanted to hear some good experimental music. There is some very good music on here but the vocals are very distracting. I have heard a number of bands with mediocre 'untrained' vocalists which have not had too much of an influence on the overall sound, but with this band I feel the vocals take away from the overall sound. If you want to hear a good experimental band which offers some good vocals I would recommend Broadcast. If you don't mind the singing, then by all means get this CD it has some very interesting music."
4,Was really good for about a half hour and the climax.,"This film was fast paced and gory for about the first half hour. However, the pace then slows dramatically and it began to get a little boring. Not much happens then until the climax of the film. In fact, the gore that was shown during that first half hour (a gore sequence on a ship and another gore sequence that takes place in a warehouse) ceases to exist until the climax; there's no more gore until the ending portion of the film. Towards the end, a cyclops creature is revealed to be the creator of the eggs; he's got some hypnotic powers and just sits there and doesn't move except for his tentacles that he uses to eat people. The film also has some good soundtracks and I like that cyclops creature. I'm still giving it four stars because I really liked the first half hour and the climax. It's too bad that the middle portion of the film isn't better because then this film would've been a classic."
3,Alien Contamination (1982),"brief synopsis: A cargo ship from South America drifts into New York City harbor and the police board the vessel to discover what happened to the crew. They find the crew dead, apparently from their internal organs bursting out of their bodies."
3,Not the product pictured,"Kool Stop pads have a good name for a reason, and I'm sure they're fine. But the pads Amazon shipped are not the pads in the picture -- they're flat graphite gray, not red and black."
4,BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF POLISH STONEWARE,VERY PLEASED WITH THE PURCHASE OF THIS POLISH STONEWARE PIECE. BEAUTIFUL PATTERN AND WHAT A GREAT PRICE.
1,Give me a break!,"I find it hard to believe that any experienced roleplayer would find this boxed set challenging. It has no new monsters and no surprises. What it has, in spades, is one of the cheapest and weakest monsters in the genre: the kobold: poor cousin of the goblin. Sure, maybe they can cast spells or gang up on you, but face it: They are physically weak. Easy to defeat. Especially against a group of seasoned players. I was highly disappointed. I do not recommend that you buy this product. It is a waste of time and money."
3,Rigged,"Kobalds, that'll be easy. The dragon here only has like 34 hit points. It's to level to your guy up. I snuck in and got to the dragon right away. Surprisingly easy level up adventure for levels 6 to 14 or 15, 16."
3,Transformers Ultimate Bumblebee,"Overall this transformers toy that I bought for my 6 years is very neat. He enjoys it alot, but I have to change it from Robot to Vehicle everytime. Even for myself, the pieces are hard to put together and take apart to change back and forth. My son has many tansmformers and this so far is the one most complicated. He does however enjoy it very much. Thanks.John R."
4,pretty good!,"The watch was everything i was spectting, but the box was a little broke. Pretty nice watch, im happy with it."
5,Nice Watch with Classic look.,Received the product and it was quite as i expected. No problem with the product till now and looks great on hand.
5,EXCELLENT,"It was beautifully packaged, received fast. Can't wait to see my grandson face on Christmas Day.I am so very happy"
3,"cute, but lacks quality","the side and back doors open, but fall off a lot. they go bac on, but afraid we are going to loose the pieces"
5,Grandson loves his bus.,My grandson was very happy receiving this toy for Christmas. His big sister rides the bus and now he can see what fun she has on the bus. I only wish it played 'the wheels on the bus' as that is one of his favorite songs.The little people are a perfect fit for his little hands and they are interchangeable with the rest of the Little People sets that he owns.
5,Loves it!,Would recommend this to everyone. My grandson loves it.It is everything that I expected it to be. The sound is a plus!@
3,Not many features,Just ok. Wish the bus made more noises. Only the drivers seat makes noises when you push down the seat. Dont feel it was worth the money I paid for it.
5,Great for young kids,"I purchased this for a friend's child who just turned two. He's a very rough child, so I was worried how it would handle. However, his mom says its his new favorite toy! He's constantly playing with it, and surprisingly, it is still in one piece."
2,Good but...,"This book can only be read if you have a very strong background in mathematics. Adaptive filter design is a career on its own, you need a good instructor in order to understand it. If your math is moderate, this book will not help and you will be wasting your money but If your math is great then you might consider buying it."
5,Simple Pleasure,"This bath product is a real treat for the senses.It feels soft and smooth to the touch, the lavender smell is not too overpowering and relaxing, and it looks so inviting in the tub.I have used this for a few years, and I don't like to be without."
2,"Novel idea, but save your money...","not really that great, I was hoping for some unique workshop tool produced music, but sampling it here is good enough."
2,"Don't Be Fooled; Promising Jazz Guitarist ""raps"" up Career","Tinsel Town is the reason I bought this CD, believing (mistakenly) that the artist capable of producing such a delightful jazz melody must have a few more decent tunes to his credit. He doesn't; at least not on this CD. Unbelievably, the CD is ruined by rap tunes (sacrilege!), with those characteristic annoying rhythms and low-life machismo vocals. Save your money."
2,music to have your teeth filled to.,"Pure mind spackle. It isn't unpleasant, but it isn't anything that great either. I was hoping for a little more 'acid' from the so-called pioneer of acid jazz. This stuff is more like the smooth jazz your dentist plays you. John Tesh woulda been proud of this album, or maybe that funkmaster Pat Metheny.There's some forgettable flows on the first few tracks. The only track that stands out is 'The Jackal;' campy fun. The others are studied mid-tempo 1970's fusion. Big yawn."
5,yeah,this toy is awsam. it can move its arms.and it can throe a plastic fire.i also have the exodia.i like black skull dragon more. i would highly recomend this toy
3,"Ok, but not what was expected","I bought this album on a whim. I'd heard a ton of great feedback about this band. I guess I was expecting more interesting and hard hitting music. What I got was much more mellow and boring. It is still a good album, but I think i'll listen to the music next time before I buy another one. I'm sure if you are into Gaelic Storm you'd like this."
1,B O M B BOMB,"THIS MOVIE IS A 1 STAR FICK BECAUSE EVEYBODY IS GETTING SHOTUP,SHOT IN THE HEAD.CUTTING PEOPLE UP IN THERE CHESTS AND ROBO COP ACTING LIKE A MORERON AND ACTING LIKE HE'S GOT ANTS IN HIS BEHIND.PS GET THE FRIST ROBO COP FILM FROM 1987."
3,The Last Great Stop-Motion Action Sequence,"Robocop 2 is a wan, joyless follow-up to the original... until the last 20 minutes or so. From the moment Robocop yells, ""CAIN! Let's step outside!"" the movie shucks off all the detritus it has accumulated over the previous hour and launches into what I believe to be the last, and best, modern stop-motion action scene. For the triumph of the finale, I am willing to give this three stars. If you can fidget your way through the first 2/3 of this movie, you will be well rewarded at the end. Overall, though, this is everything that can go wrong when making a sequel to a great original movie."
3,Robocop 2 REVIEW,"Worthwhile sequel to Verhoven's smash hit, ""Robocop"" has Weller reprising his role of Alex Murphy, a deceased cop brought back as a machine to fight crime in futuristic Detriot. This time around, Motor City is at war as a dictator-like drug dealer is using his new designer drug, ""Nuke"" to gather a group of followers. Meanwhile, most of the police force is on strike while Robo's manufacturing company, OCP, wants to take over the bankrupt city. OCP decides to create a newer more stronger ""Robocop"" but rather than use an actual field officer like they did with Murphy, they turn to the very drug dealer who has turned the city into a war zone. The usual violent mayhem ensues before the two Robocops battle their way through the city in an anti-climatic grudge match. ""Robocop 2"" is even more violent than the original but it does still feature a lot of the over-the-top humor displayed in its predecessor as well. Fans of the first will enjoy but most others will proably be unimpressed."
1,Bad,"Unoriginal, uninteresting, uninformative (even at the level of the esthetics, ie. only the most common piercings are featured, and I can't find the jewelry that beautiful either, at all), predictable, shallow. I looked through the book when I received it and, sorely disappointed, returned the book within the hour."
5,SO WELL DONE!,"this book is absolutely gorgeous, the photography is very creative and well done, a very sophisticated look at body piercing."
2,Oldies for Kids,"My kids prefer the ""real"" versions of these because we also have them on CDs, but this isn't bad as far as remakes aimed at kids go. At least it beats Kids Bop."
5,Best Splinter Cell Yet,"The play control is very similar to the previous games in the series. The biggest improvement in my opinion is in the depth of the plot. In this installment Fisher infiltrates a domestic terrorist organization. He has to gain the trust of the terrorists but if he's too loyal he will lose the trust of the NSA. This plot twist means that as a player you have to think before you make decisions because there will be consequences based on your decisions, both good and bad.I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who's into espionage style adventure games."
1,Crap Graphics,"I'm a big fan of Splinter Cell games and how well the games look, especially the newer ones like Double Agent and Conviction. My computer could hardly run the game because of how high end the graphics were, so I elected to buy the game for PS3 in hopes it the graphics would run smoothly and still be high quality. However, the graphics looked like early PS2 quality, and I just can't get past that. I'm better off just buying a better PC."
2,Too General. Test questions were not similar to the AP test.,"I took the AP History exam on May 3, 2006. The book is too general. The practice test questions were not helpful. Friends of mine who had the AP History exam prep book by Barron's said there were questions on the AP exam that were very similar to the practice tests in the Barron's AP History test prep book. There were none in this book. I do not recommend this book."
2,Confusing?,"I have to say, the book really does give vary valueble information when it comes to how to execute the multiple choice section of the AP exam, but when it comes to instructions for the dbg, compare and contrast, and for the change over time, It is hard to get individual infor out of the book. The only examples of DBQ's in the prep section on dbqs consists of dbqs they tried to make into compare and contrast questions. Also, they should be a little more up front abotu what you have to do, and make sure there is some seperation when it comes to knowing what you have to do for each seperate essay. It also does a vary bad job of explaining the importance of grouping when it comes to the dbq. But the cover is water resistent. My friend spilled water on it and nothing bad happend."
3,Not Detailed. Very Conceptual,"It depends on what type of review you are looking for. If you have forgotten all the facts from the earlier part of the history course and want to actually re-study, get the Barron's. Barron's will tell you all the details and facts so you don't have to reread the whole textbook. Personally, I recommend the Barron's because by AP time in May, most students do not remember even half of the material. However, if you want do get a general feel of world history and want easy reading, I guess princeton is the right way to go. But I am warning you...this is only for students who are already pretty familiar with the facts."
1,"If you are looking for left-wing propaganda, this is it!","However, if you are looking for a factual documentary try the National Geographics ""21 Days to Baghdad"" or wait for a Foxnews release. I was very disappointed with this CNN one. Totally politically motivated rather than reporting the real story. At least the National Geographics one provides a balanced view - plus it has better material. This one went in my garbage can. I should have listened to the other reviews. I'm serious, don't buy it or you will be disappointed. Don't say I didn't warn you!"
2,Broken pieces,"I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my son. The small pieces were broken. He opened it and said ""Santa gave me broken junk."" I just wish the discription would have said ""broken"" I would not have purchased it. However it did arrive as scheduled."
4,Very comfortable for a not too very good fit.,"This has been a very comfortable bra for me, other than feeling like I'm going to fall out every time I bend over. I have been meaning to alter the straps to shorten them more and I think that will help."
4,The Good & The Bad Side,"This is the best album from Crucial Conflict. The beats are a lot tighter than The Final Tic anf their flows are tighter also. I don't skip any song other than ""Like This"" ""Swing It Over Here"" & ""Pump It Up."" It's a real tight album and you won't be dissapointed."
3,Fast Rap from the Chi-town,"Confict's new album ""Good Side/Bad Side."" A follow up to ""The Final Tic."" Releases that fast rap that Chicago is know for. I my eyes this CD is not near as good as the first. But in all a good album if you like the swaw flowing raps."
3,Replacement product,This is a replacement for the exact same product. The center button that lets you select different items on the screen like CID and setup items failed in about 1 1/2 years. I had to replace this unit or the whole system. I hope this unit lasts a little longer.
4,Uniden TCX905 required for Packet8,"I just signed up for Packet8 VOIP service, which comes with a Uniden VOIP device (router) with a cordless phone. The only way to extend the cordless phones thru your house is to buy another Uniden - the TCX905 - is compatible with their system. The phone works fine and was easy to register to the base."
1,uniden cordless phone,got this phone as an extra handset and it does not work properly. the sound fades in and out and you cant hear the other person talking.
3,Two chargers DOA,"We purchased 5 extra handsets for other rooms in the home. The phone itself is great, has great features, sound quality, speaker phone, etc. HOWEVER, two of the handsets we purchased had dead chargers, that is, they won't charge the phones. So, now we have two phones who don't have their own charger which means we have to switch and swap the phones in other rooms before the charges run out. We are in contact with Customer Service to see if we can resolve this, but I did want to warn would be purchasers of this possible problem.UPDATE: We contacted customer service and they sent us two new chargers via Fed Ex."
4,"Good phone, but the manual is ""not quite right""","I bought this accessory phone to go with the Uniden TRU8866 base setUniden TRU8866 5.8 GHz Digital Expandable 2-Line Cordless Speakerphone with Dual Keypads (Black). The instruction manual tells you, for each model base set you are using, how to ""register"" your accessory phone with the base set so that it can be used. Unfortunately, the instructions for this phone don't work when applied to the 8866 base! After some time with a mystified Uniden person on the phone, they gave me the correct instructions: slide the battery cover off the phone (without removing the battery); then place it in the base set socket (while the base set is not being used to make a call); then it is registered. Replace the battery cover and voila! It works. (The reason to remove the battery cover is so that the accessory phone will fit into the base set socket, which is not really designed to fit it.) A slight setup annoyance, but otherwise the phone works great."
1,model TRU9488-3,The base is great but the expandable phones go bad quickly. It's no use if you have no handsets. I love the phone because it has many great features but I can't use them!!!!!!!!!
4,Cordless Phone,"I purchased a total of 5 handsets. Minor set up for each one, then you can globally adjust.The only negative, is you have to delete messages and CID numbers from each handset. I would have preferred it globally once deleted."
4,Unidex Extension Phones,"Got the base station with 3 handsets included at a B&M store. Ordered 2 additional from Amazon. As described, very happy."
5,Uniden TCX905 Handset -- A great prodcut,"I'm very pleased with this handset. I liked it so much I bought extras for my phone and for my daughter's phone as well. Buttons on the handset are well laid out, the screen is easy to read, the unit is light weight and fits the hand nicely, and it easily fits into a shirt pocket if you want to take it outside while doing yard-work. The speech-quality is excellent. It is a pleasure to use. All this at a reasonable price."
5,Great for kids,"My granddaughter loved the explanations about autism in this book. She is 9, and it is written where she can understand more about the behaviors of her brother with autism. She was even going to take it to school for her teacher to read, and some of her classmates. Many adults would benefit from reading it also."
5,Great camera bag,No complaints from my son who received this for a Christmas gift along with the Canon powershot camera.
3,wrong color,"Bought this for my sister. I ordered the blue one, but I've received the red one. It's not the first time I have received something that's not exactly what I have ordered. Sometimes a substitute was sent without prior notice... Amazon needs to keep a better track of the order fulfillment."
2,Piece of junk--get Sergeant!,"This Cadogan edition of Morphy's games is very badly made. The binding falls apart and the pages come out. Ward only annotates a few of the games, and his annotations are beneath his normal level. The classic Dover collection by Sergeant is available again and is by FAR the better book. Avoid this one."
5,for what it is...,"right up front, the film is a total stinker, very hard to watch the story line, if ya can call it that. it gets five stars from here because of the martial arts scenes at the top of Patrick's career. As a practitioner of martial arts and dance for 40 years, this film is as muc a testament to his star character at it's peak as 'one last dance' is to the final curtain. I bought the VHS in the old days and cut/edited out all the fight scenes onto another VHS. We wore out the tape! sure he did other good work, roadhouse, blue-grey, etc., but particularly, sword and staff work in this film is hallmark. Compare to asian 'true MA' tapes, the man was a total perfectionist, and he gave us everything he had, then some. I bought this copy this month just to show my kids, and like one guy said, 'late at night, review perfection'."
2,"No sizes listed for the ""7"" metric hex head sockets","I believe that 9mm is not included in this set. Its really hard to tell because the packaging and description leave this information out. The biggest problem with this set is the poor labeling for size on the sockets themselves. It would be an easy fix for Stanley to make these modest improvements. Even Stanley's own web site does not specify which sizes are included. Disappointing.However, given the low price these are probably not so bad and will get you out of a pinch."
3,Disturbing,"This movie starts out as quaint and awkward and goes to bloody disturbance. Even though I felt gross after it, I still thought it was good. More original than the Hollywood slashers."
1,May: Total deception,"I'm a horror film fan, so based in the rating gave to this movie I rented it. Don't waste your time and money, there's no horror, is more a romantic movie with a kind of morbid end than anything else. The plot needs to be remake. However, the acting was very good, but it doesn't change anything."
1,Ummm....,"Okay, so my friend and I rented this movie tonight. I dont even know how to describe it. Some parts literally left me staring at the screen with my mouth open, either out of disgust or amazement that someone could actually think up something like that. Some parts made me squirm. These are not good qualities of the movie by the way. I do want to say though, that Angela Bettis did an EXTREME acting job. Her character was unbelievable. But, I'm glad I didn't spend $9 on that movie in the theater, because most of the time, I was laughing because it was INSANE. It's kinda scary the ideas that people come up with....whatever floats your boat I guess."
1,Not Good,"Too many holes in the entire move. Not worth the 1.99.... save your time too. Maybe FREE on netflix, don't pay too see it."
4,Creepy and unexpected,"The Bottom Line:A horror film about a disaffected, morbid young woman and her attempts to connect with something (or anything) in her life, May is not always easy to watch but if you like disturbing films then you should check it out; it's a polarizing motion picture but it's different enough to be worth watching."
1,"May is a horrible, slow boring film. The worst movie of all time.","I don't think many women will sit through this movie and feel it was a good horror movie. This movie is of a person with mental issues (who should have been institutionalized a long time ago). It lacks horror or even common sense. I seriously do not get the number of positive reviews for this movie. I started making this review 20 minutes before this half-baked production ended - which was about when the mentally unstable main character goes on a killing spree. I did not even bother with the volume towards the end. This movie is just an alltime classic hogwash - a senseless waste of time, effort and money. Worth skipping.I am actually annoyed with myself for having wasted my money on this one based on the positive reviews."
5,Find a friend...FREAK,"I absolutely loved this movie. Ever wonder what those Columbine kids would have done if they would not have shot up the school? Watch May and you will see. This movie proves why you should be kind to others...regardless of their looks and/or quirks. May's mother told her, ""If you can't find a friend...make one."" After watching this movie you will say, ""It's better to be a found friend than a made one!"""
5,Truly engrossing movie (and I mean a pun ...),"This is a great character study. It is highly disturbing and mildy scary. It is not scary in the sense that you are scared of things jumping out at you, but how scary of a person that May turns out to be. It is a bit slow in the beginning, but once May gets started cuttin and stabbin, it doesn't let go. It does require you to think. You are not just given the cookie and set free to eat it, you must find out how it is made as well.The acting is all top notch as well. An all to often ingredient lacking in other horror movies. Any fan of the horror genre will not be disappointed. Neither will most fans of any genre. This is one that will disturb all people. And that is a good thing."
2,Disappointment. Not Scary and Too Obvious,"Was really looking forward to this one and finally caught it thisweekend and was bummed that I didn't like it. It wasn't at all scary,some of it was even unintentionally funny, and I thought the leadperformance was self-conscious and mannered . And I don't know if the ending wassupposed to be a surprise but it sure was telegraphed way in advance. The supporting characters are all one-dimensional."
4,odd movie,I liked it and had to buy it for my collection. Samantha Adam's is so strange in this movie. If you want to see something different here it is.
4,Wonderful Horror Movie,"I loved the pacing, and the adorable creepiness of May. I felt at some points the film could stand to be more subtle, and that Anna Faris's character was over-the-top and distorted the tone of the film a bit. But I adored, adored, adored May. I was rooting for her to the very end. This is the first horror movie that has ever made me cry."
5,Gift,We have a relative who collects this genre of movies and they were thrilled toobtain their own copy of this movie.
4,Like it,"Although this book is sexually graphic, i loved the realism of the period piece. The point of view, that of a narrator leading the reader into the story by literally introducing characters and places, keeps it interesting. The characters are the most fascinating people. I saw the movie on TV and wanted to read the book, which did not disappoint me at all. A book to cozy up to."
4,Peep in on Victorian London . . .,"Faber's invites our voyeur inclinations to go back in time to Victorian London and experience the unfolding saga of his wonderful book of social and religious hypocrisy. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star was because I honestly think with some minor editing this book could really have excelled itself. Irrespective it is a time warp experience, is beautifully written with some tremendously funny moments. What more can a fussy reader like you and I ask for?"
2,Think about it before beginning,"Lured by the settting--promises of a novel about Victorian England and a saucy theme--a prostitiute's life, I tried not to let the autor's annoying first person intrussions at the beginning of the book dissuade me as his writing and descriptions are very good. The book's plot draws you in. But halfway through, it lost me, although I still wanted to know what happened to the main character, so skipping some pages, I continued. After reading 894 pages, a reader deserves to know what happens, yet Mr. Faber doesn't know how to end this book and leaves the ending inconclusive. I would have thrown the weighty volume at his head had he been near!"
4,The Crimson Petal and the White,"This is a very interesting book about an educated prostitute in the mid 1800's who is working to raise her status by being the mistress of a prominent man. It is definitely not a ""romantic"" historical novel. Sugar is a real person and her ""man"" is not some gorgeous creature, but she works to be indispensable to him by helping him in his work. She does not want to go back to her old life, and she's a totally sympathetic character who uses her wiles but not in a deceitful way. Her way ""out"" is engaging and memorable. Sugar is a loving person and her story is a good read."
2,The ending ruined it.,"Like some of the reviewers below I found the book held my attention, but was unworthy of it. Crimson is rich in detail, but lacking in character development. The ending, if you could even call it that, was awful. There is no conclusion. It was as if the author simply stopped writing--literally.I would not recommend this book, even to fans of the genre, unless you don't mind being left hanging."
1,complete disappointment,"This book was a complete disappointment. The first few chapters were great, with an intriguing way of narrating this book the author makes the reader experience the characters life. However, this style is abandoned, and instead the author adopts the use of coarse language, which adds nothing to the essence of the book. Additionally by the end of the book it is completely obvious what is going to happen. I think the excerpt has all that the book has to offer - don't spend money on it."
2,SOOO BORING,"Where is the story? The plot? The emotional depth? The ending? If you want to know how the street stank in London during this time period, read this book, because Faber describes every little detail of the scenary, fashion, etc. He is obviously quite knowledgeable, but as for a story, I tortured myself for nothing. I kept thinking ""but, it has to get better."" No such luck."
2,"reads well, but empty","This book has no point. It's like watching a soap opera where the characters are not doing anything interesing. It reads well, moves well, but you get absolutely nothing from it."
1,Trash,This book is trash!I wouldn't recommend anyone I knowto read it .The ending is stupid . Its incomplete .
4,Standard reading for any historical fiction lover,"This book is looooooooonng but satisfies the historical fiction lover. It's written oddly as if there is some unseen, unheard narrator introducing the characters and circumstances which is very distracting at first. Once you get used to it, though, it actually lends a uniqueness to this novel that you don't feel reading other works of the same genre. All in all, a great summer read. Make sure you have a sturdy bookmark :)"
1,gives one reason to ignore the hoopla of critics,"Others have outlined the plot of this novel far better than I can. I abandoned the book after 100 pages. Though hardly a prude, I found the overabundant descriptions of sexual acts initially offensive and then simply dull. The book struck me as verbal pornography for men. I did not survey all reviews, but I tend to suspect far fewer women would like the novel. For characters to engage me, I need more than extensive descriptions of their sexual preferences. A dreadful book (though the cover is certainly pretty). I feel resentful for having given it even 100 pages. I would never waste my time reading another word by this author."
1,What are those positive reviews all about?!!,"I bought this book based on all the wonderful review ""blurbs"" - from the NYT, to Publisher's Review, and even more low-brow People Mag etc.I looked forward to reading it over a long weekend -800 plus pages! yay!However, I could not ""get into"" this book at all. I finally gave up at the 100 or so page mark. Characters not likeable or interesting, no compelling story line, frankly a chore to read.After having ""quit this book"", I decided to check the real people reviews on Amazon and see if others had the same negative response (as compared to the professional reviewers on staff at mags/newspapers) and I see real people had a much more mixed response.In particular, I saw lots of complaints about the ending (which wasn't one?!). Am I glad I gave up at the hundred page mark!"
3,it started out good....,"I am an avid reader and looked foward to this great big book. But I thought that Sugar became weaker as the book went on and after days of reading - to come to that abrupt ending! I was very disappointed. It didn't have to have a pretty ending, but I thought it would be nice to at least have an idea that Agnes found her place in the world and even if Sugar and Sophie got away."
2,"I'm glad I read it, but...","... there are other books I would recommend before this one. On a good note, the author did a wonderful job at setting the time and place, and the descriptions and writing were masterful. I was eager to read this each night to see what would happen to the characters. The problem was that nothing really ever did. I neither liked nor disliked the characters, nor felt they were good or bad people. I just felt sorry for them all. In the end, I'm glad I read it, but this one will sit on my bookshelf rather than being passed around to family and friends."
2,Everyone believes in one rule of literature,"It's not always the same rule, or set of rules, but everyone has at least one.For me, it's: respect your audience enough to give your story an end. A hint of one would do, or, sure, a selection of possibilities. But this novel just sort of -"
2,"Painstakingly ponderous, disappointing","Reasons I didn't like this book: 1)Painfully long and often boring -- should have been cut in half by an editor; 2)The woman bashing got tedious after awhile (even if the author was trying to make a point); 3)The conclusion is a big disppointment -- the book jacket leads you to believe far more is going to happen in the story.Still, the book is cleverly written and some of the prose is quite beautiful. Perhaps because I read it while in Europe I got sucked in by the book at times and felt like I was living in 1870s London."
3,"Not a bad read, really","I agree with a lot of the other sentiments expressed here--the constant use of the second person was annoying. It onlt served to alienate me: If someone tells me, ""You do this."" Well, perhaps I wouldn't do that! How dare they tell me what I do.But if you can get beyond that, as I managed to do (eventually) there lies a beautifully woven story. I came to care for all of the characters, each of them sad in their own way. I wouldn't want to trade places with any of them, but it is intriguing to be a part of their lives.My biggest complaint was the ending. In that there really wasn't one. I know the book was founded on the premise ""Let's give you a little taste of this world,"" but to have it end so abruptly without any resolution was a bit maddening. If it had a more satisfying ending, perhaps it would have gotten a better rating. I found it quite absorbing, however, and not a bit too long as others contend. Of course, I am a fan of epic-type novels."
2,Boring,"After reading all of the other customer reviews on this book, I thought it would be a book I would really enjoy, but after trying to plod through it for three weeks, I couldn't think of any reason to continue. I didn't care about the characters. The story didn't seem to have any point and wasn't very interesting. The sex scenes were not at all erotic. I was so bored by it, I finally gave up, which I rarely do with a book."
3,Not what I expected,"Under the Skin was one of the most gripping and unusual books I have ever read. I was looking forward in great anticipation to the latest from Michel Faber. I have to say that although it was well written in parts, I found The Crimson Petal and the White to be cliche and almost ordinary compared to Under the Skin. The characters were interesting and the time period was well researched, but the ending was a big disappointment after investing 800 pages."
4,The point...,"I've read a lot of complaints about the legnth and lack of ""point"" of this book (that would be the dumbing down of Americans, who want everything served on a platter with an explicitly stated purpose).Yes, the books is over 800 pages, and yes it doesn't have the normal climatic crecendo. That's what one calls life. This book makes no bones about it; you are a VOYER in the life of the characters. People come in and out for no rhyme nor reason but for the purpose of having existed in the city at that time.You are taken from the lowest of the low (St Giles) to well-to-do society by the interactions of these characters. Each of the main characters link in one way or another.If you can take the time and appreciate a work for just being, then you will probably enjoy this book. If you're of the fast food, fast cars, education for dummies variety, please avoid even trying."
1,Stinks,The book is tedious. Do not care for the voice it was written in. Boring. Rambling. Slow. A waste of money.
2,Sex and the City--The Prequel,"I was soooo disappointed by this book. It changes voices, reaches no satisfying conclusion, and seems to rely on sexual titilation to carry the reader through. It may have worked with real Victorians, but sex isn't novel anymore. Don't bother."
2,Disappointing,"This book got such rave reviews and sounded so intriguing, I immediately picked it up. I couldn't even finish it. I'm so glad to see other reviews that matched how I felt about the book.The first chapters suck you in and Faber's descriptions are brilliant. But nothing ever happens! Filthy details does not a story make. (Not a book for the easily offended.) It just drags on and on. I flipped ahead to see if it got any more exciting and when it was obvious that it never did, I gave up. There's too many other books to read--and better historical fiction--to waste your time with this."
3,"Fine Narrative, Big Letdown","This book is an enthralling look at Victorian England, exposing the class system, the lives and choices of women, and the politics of sex and power at the end of the 19th century. For this, it is worth the read. I understand, I suppose, the purpose of leaving the fates of the characters open-ended. After all, we have been permitted to view their lives as voyeurs. We come in, medias res, and so shall we leave them.But the final third of the book feels rushed and unfinished. I felt very let down at the end. Not because there are so many questions left unanswered--I can work with the supposed intention of that--but because it seemed so shallow. Characters, and their relationships, simply fall apart.So, yes, it is worth reading. And yes, be prepared to be let down in the end."
2,Ultimately Disappointing,"The problem with this book is that it takes you on a wild ride and then ends nowhere almost as if the author ran out of energy and imagination. The blurbs at the back will tell you that this is an updated version of a Victorian novel. No, Victorian publisher would have permitted a loose plot structure like this with so many loose ends at the end - it reads like a serial novel whose author died before finishing the story.A compelling read - but ultimately a waste of time."
5,The Crimson Petal and the White,"If you like Victoriana, read this book. I read all the reviews and didn't think I would like it. Then one review sent me to the computer and Amazon.com. I read the first page and I was hooked; it's been a long, long time since a book did that for me. It is a book for long, cold winter evenings, but I couldn't wait. Over 800 pages and I finished it in less than a week. (I love retirement.) I won't say the ending disappointed me, but I'm not a very imaginative person. That's why I read novels. But again, READ THIS BOOK! And if anyone can recommend good Victorian novels for me, please do so. Thanks."
3,Too much Sugar,"When I first started reading this book, I was drawn in completely. I wanted to follow the trails of all the characters...and I thought 800+ pages would allow me to do that. Not so. The story settled on Sugar and William-Bore-me-to-Tears-Rackham. I wanted to follow Emmeline Fox...what did she do all day huddled amongst those stacks of books...why did she sleep all day/was she up all night...how did she get well...what did she really have...how come no one could enter her house? She was interesting - Sugar was just doing whatever she could to stay off the streets - no story here.And if the author is going to use big words like lugubrious...perhaps he should limit it to once every 400 pages, not once every 20. I found the word to be quite lugubrious after awhile. It made me wonder if anyone proof read the final draft."
2,too much spunk,"I hunkered down to read this blimp of a book with great expectations {(no)pun intended}. However, so many words and then pages turned out to be gratuitous. Somewhere in the process of putting so much down, the art of the thing was lost. The story and the characters became secondary to the graphics of bodily functions - of spunk, mucous, urine, feces, bile. Victorians went out of their way to create an illusion that such biological processes did not exist. It is like Faber is saying, ""Look, here I have a Victorian who ejaculates. Here, is one who takes a pooh. And another who menustrates. This one has phlegm. Can you believe it?"" Victorians would have been shocked, scandalized, revolted. The only problem is that his audience is not a Victorian audience. These details are repeated and emphasized far too much. I had to call it quits at page 500 or so."
4,Loved it--read it twice,Great book about late Victorian England. Read it twice for the nuances contained wherein; Sugar reigns despite the male supremacy around her; a must read for anyone who is interested in late 1900's Victorian society
1,What's the point?,"I read and read, not wanting to put it down, waiting to get to the point. The author could certainly write. However, my true test of a book is, when it is all said and done, am I happy I read it or do I feel cheated?I felt cheated. The ending killed the book. I wish I had not spent so much time on this one."
3,Left intrigued ... yet lost,"I agree this is a great book filled with sex, history, love & tragedy. However I was left unsure what actually happened. I honestly though William was mistaken in identifying a dead body and the body was safe hiding in a convent (trying not to give spoilers)- my own imagination or was it simply not clear enough?And I truly was left haning on the main heroines ending. Did she use her letter of recommendation, did she prosper?When I read a book I like for there to be a beginning, middle & end - & after almost 1000 pages, I didn't get that. It reeled me in & then dropped me."
5,What a Delight!,"This is simply one of the best historical novels I've read in a long time. Sugar is an absolutely delightful character, and the portrayal of William is masterful. The book was beautiful, despite the intimate details about anything foul and dirty you can possibly imagine!"
2,Didn't Feel Great Right Out of the Package,"It is probably my fault because the title does say ""sateen,"" but as a fan of crisp sheets I do not enjoy using this very limp bedding. It feels and looks very cheap. If you are looking for the kind of bedding you find in good hotels, this is definitely not it. It covers a comforter that is over a sheet and hidden under another comforter or I would replace it. I have never used the shams. They are not appealing. I've read that the advertised thread counts (1000?! in this case) are fictitious and somewhat irrelevant. After seeing this bedding and comparing it to other bedding I have, I can believe that. On the positive side, it hasn't torn or sustained any other damage."
5,The Goodness,"This CD is like a testimonial. There is a saying that everybody's got a story, well Melky Sedeck are wonderful narrators and tell their story with such lyrical styling. Songs like ""Lady"" the words in the song should be a national anthem for young ladies....""I man will be a man, that I know....Just because he slept in your bed last night doesnt mean he's yours for life"". A Woman is sexy and classy, works seven days a week so the kids can eat. ""Paradise"" makes you feel just that...on an island sippin' tropical punch aspiring for that paradise right here at home with your significant other.Rather than give a description of every track on the hot album.....Check it out for yourself.By the way, its nothing like the style of older brother Wyclef.....Melky Sedeck surpass the mediocre style of there brother with a depth in lyrics and a smoothness in musical style that is demonstrative of what should be in soul music and not what sells."
4,Nice Departure,"This CD is a great departure from the mainstream music. I stumbled on the CD by accident. Melky Sedeck has a song on the Disappearing Acts soundtrack that I loved, so I checked this CD out. I am glad I made this purchase. My favorite track is the last one, Paradise."
3,Needs better proofreader,"This book has some great history and wonderful array of recipes from all over the india and 3 stars because of that. I learned lot about different cuisines of india.. I must say this book requies detailed proof reading and editing. I tried two curries - Chicken Stylet and Cauliflower Kasi Curry from Maglore region and both are wrong either with the recipe steps or pictures. Ingredients and steps doesn't match. Its sad that potentially masterpiece work is getting wasted because of incorrect editing of recipes. Camelia, if you are reading this, check these two recipes and do corrections..Nik"
4,Jay-Jay Johanson - Whiskey,"Jay-Jay Johanson's first album, WHISKEY, is certainly a product of its time: when Portishead-style Bristol trip-hop ruled the earth. Even so, Johanson's plaintive vocals still soar above the scratches and vinyl crackles of ""It Hurts Me So"" or the more pared-down ""The Girl I Love Is Gone."" ""I'm Older Now"" takes a slow, semi-martial beat and backs it with some long horns before Johanson's voice beckons a more skittery rhythm to take over in the ""Extended Beats"" section. The bizarre country sound of ""Tell Me Like It Is"" defies Bristol, however, as does the sexy-making ""I Fantasize of You."" But the obvious standout is ""So Tell the Girls That I Am Back in Town,"" which could almost givce the Rat Pack a run for its money. For pop-trip-hop, Johanson makes a strong, sincere effort."
5,Highly moving.,The music moves the spirit. You can almost feel what Easy Company must have felt. Stirs the emotions.
3,Not original but a fine listening experience...,"Another composer who has borrowed from his own work, to be more specific, Michael Kamen has taken his orchestral music to the fine cable series From the Earth to the Moon and rehashed the score to the work we have here. Its basically the same music, nothing original.*sigh*"
4,the headphones broke,"a owner-the headphones broke, the top screen preceptor works good, bottom screen preceptor does not work well (it is plastic film) but it is better to use it than nothing, car charger is good.all a round a good product but the headphones are fragile can i get a exchange/refund on this (only the headphones)? i like the nintendo ds it fun get 1 (or 10:) if u can i heard 90% sold out on opining day i couldn't buy mine on amazon.com sadly but i got 1 $100 more than retail tho ,i wanted it badly. i 1-click ordered it on nov-21 from amzon.com but i gees it didn't process. ata at wal-mart Jan. IF you see it (the nintendo ds) buy it ."
1,,what the heck is this piece of crap? Amazon needs rating lower then 1. The screen protectors stink! air bubbles everywhere and all that sticky mess if u try to take it off. The earphones work okay but some 99 cent earphones may work better. The car adapter works but i wouldnt recommend a car adapter...geez just charge it at home. Hey if u really are a starter go ahead and buy the thing...suckers
1,BAD PRODUCT,The only good review of the product itself (and not actually the DS) is from somebody who gave a postitive review to almost every Intec product on eBay... suspicious at best.
4,Great for t-ball,Perfect for my 5 year who has trouble keeping her helment on in t-ball. Later I discovered these much cheaper at a mass retailer though.
3,Zuni Myth,I found this to be a very good myth. it goes well with my collection of indian myths and legends.
4,Strong Set Matches Subject,"The thought occured to me whilst listening to this CD that Mr. Johnson and Mr. Marsalis share some common denomonators. Not the obvious comparisions of race and rise to the top of their respective crafts, mind you. But an inner drive and ability to enthral the masses regardless of the situation.I admit this CD was approached with apprehension. I mean, Miles did the ultimate ""Tribute to Jack Johnson"" decades ago. And anyone who follows jazz in the least realizes the friction between Miles and Wynton. Why would Mr. Marsalis take such a chellenge.Therein is the similarlity I see between him and his subject. Both men seem to perform best under the stress of a high-profile assignment. And, not dissimilar, both rose to the challenge and shine brighter than could be imagined."
5,"good quality parts, good price","as someone else said, moog makes good stuff. i agree.these fit perfectly on my 2003 subaru impreza wrx.(getting the old ones out is another story entirely! lol)"
3,Fun,Got this game as a Today's Deal for the Wii. Didn't do any research on it and I probably should have. This is a game for mature audiances. There is quite a bit of foul language right from the time you but the disk in the machine. The game controls are very sensative. My husband and I end up crashing the car more than we do driving it. I would recommend doing your research before buying any of the games.
5,This is for my Mom.,I cannot find this in the store anymore. But my mom kept telling me how she loves White Linen. I found this to be the best price. It was delivered quickly and in great shape.
4,IT'S ALL GOOD,"LET'S HOPE THE MOVIE IS JUST AS HYPE AS THE SOUNDTRACK IS THAT NOT ALWAYS THE CASE .. HOWEVER THIS IS PRETTY TIGHT ENSEMBLED SOME OF THE HOTTEST R& B ACTS AND HIP HOP ACTS ..THERE ARE SERVERAL HIT AND MISSES BUT OVER ALL THIS STILL A GOOD CDTHE HITS :WILD WILD WEST( WILL SMITH), GETTIN CLOSER ( TATYANA ALI), BAD GUYS ALWAYS DIE( DR. DRE & ENIMEN) MAIL MAN( FAITH EVANS) 8 MINUTES TO SUNRISE (COMMON)THE MISSES : BAILMOS( ENRIQUE IGLESIAS), CONFUSED( BLACKSTREET), KEEP IT MOVING ( MC LYTE) THE BEST( GUY) THESE TRACKS ARE AWFULTHE WHATEVER : I'M WANTED( KEL SPENCER) HERO( BREEZE) I SPARKLE ( SLICK RICK ), STICK UP( LIL BOW WOW)"
3,"Some songs are okay,but most are rap.","This CD was okay.My favorite songs from it were: #1)Balamos-BY Enrique Iglesias #2)Getting Closer-BY Tatyana Ali & Kel Spencer #3)Wild Wild West-BY Will Smith,Dru Hill,& Kool Mo Dee If you're a really big fan of rap,this CD is for you! But I'm personally not a big rap person,so,this isn't my fave CD.That's why I gave it only 3 stars."
4,pretty good,"It is a good CD. I think ""stick up"" by Lil'Bow Wow is a great song as well as Wild Wild West by Willy and the Eminem/Dre song. But most of the songs are not very good. I think its worth the money."
4,"small town punk captures a scene, a time...","Set against this backdrop (the Everycity is, in fact, Sarasota in the 80's), Sheppard paints a cast of disillusioned, angst-filled, bored youth that are so unique, so unlike anyone else, that they are every teen in every city trapped smack-dab in the midst of their own quest for meaning in a drab, adult-filled world.When I used to teach, I'd often tell my students that I knew the one thing they hated hearing more than anything from the adults of the world was the one thing that would ring most true, the phrase that would make everything better and everything worse: ""everyone feels the same when they're a teenager"". It's a teen's job to rebel, to hate their parents, to carve out their own identity-and Sheppard captures this, the angst, music, the ennui and the frustration, perfectly.[...]"
5,it was so great,I may not know much of anything but I do know this was one of the best books i have ever read. His odd life kept you wanting to read more and more. You found yourself becoming sad when it was getting near the end. This book is not a pick-me-up kinda thing but you will surely love it.
1,head-first into the rarefied....,"If you adore the intellect and see in it the only way to the highest, purest, and most divine knowledge, than this is your book--but it isn't mine. Page after page of speculation about the higher realms open only to a mind freed from the crude considerations of the flesh....I kept hoping that Plotinus would realize his vision and disappear before finishing, but it didn't happen."
3,"Keep in mind this is 80's ""Blue-eyed Sou;""!","I had this album when it first came out, and I honestly JAMMED it! I actually began looking for it again and couldn't find it, hence why I am here now. Overall, it is some pretty good stuff, but as the titlw says, just keep it in perspective."
2,Don't bother...,"I see a second edition has been published, and the author says that they reworked pretty much the whole thing. Considering that the business he started based on the principles in this book went bell-up, I'd say that's a good thing.I haven't read the second edition, so I can't speak to it.The examples in this edition are weak. It's a very dry and boring read. There were no startling revelations in this book - nor was there a ""roadmap"" to success.While I give this book a poor rating - I must say that haven't found any good books out there for piloting the ebusiness world. It's still probably too early in the game to nail down a true framework to go by. If you absolutely *must* have a book to sit on your shelf and gather dust on this subject - this book is as good as any other."
1,Boring book on integration of legacy systems,"This is not E-Business, this is just ""how to make money fast with companies who are not ready for the Internet""."
4,Explaining the backend and the infrastructure,Very good book putting the backend and the infrastructure in context. A more general view of the Internet would be great.
3,A big SAP commercial!,"This book has a main thesis: ERP-type software is the answer to E-commerce problems!This book has a secondary thesis: SAP IS the ERP of choice. The abundant amount of references to SAP border on the shameful...SAP could not have paid for a better advertisement.Ravi is a good writer. He weaves good points all throughout the book. However, he just talks about SAP so often that it is difficult to see him as objective.The best audience for this book is a beginning consultant at a Big 5 (or other) Consulting firm."
3,General overview on back-end systems,"Although it provides a good overview on back-end systems, it does not cover the full range of e-business. A bit disappointing."
5,"A great ""how-to"" for e-business strategy and applications","This is one of the best books on e-business strategy and design that I have read. It is must reading for contemporary managers and e-business consultants alike! I especially liked the seamless interface between the sections on strategy, applications, and implementation. Also the book was based on reality and not hype, and I appreciated that orientation. Enjoy!"
2,Too basic for the knowledged CRM or Internet Dude.,"This book provided an ebusiness bend on things that many traditional business consultants already know (CRM, Supply Chain, ERP, Fulfillment, etc.) It contained a lot of detail information to the point of nausea. I would not recommend this to the well read or well educated executive. It would be a good introduction if you are just trying to get a broad view of how big ecommerce projects can get."
2,Not So Great...,"I purchased this as my first guitar slide. I loved it for about one month, then it fell off my finger and shattered into tiny pieces. I almost cut myself! I will never buy a glass slide again, I recently bought a Dunlop brass slide and love it. The difference between glass and metal is that glass is a muddier, mellow tone, and glass is crisper, louder, and does not break. I would not suggest this to anyone. The metal ones are about the same price, they don't break, and sound way better. There's a reason ALL pros use metal! The review below is wrong. Slides are meant to cover your ENTIrE finger, all the way to the tip. You don't bend your finger to play slide. You retune your guitar to an open tuning. Just thought I would point that out."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I purchased this case because it was the only one I could find during the Christmas season. This turned out to be a total waste of money. This case is only big enough for the DS, that is it. There is no room for games or the charger. It actually has 2 openings on the bottom where my son's games have fallen out. Save your money for a better case."
3,"Of Value, for a Specialized Audience","This slender book has an excellent first chapter that does an good job of describing the Romantic era mythos of the visionary artist, who attains wisdom by excess, by disordering the senses, and by breaking through conventional barriers. Chouda shows how this image of the artist continued throught he Surrealist period, and was congenial to an interest in magic and the occult. Subsequent chapters cover a lot of ground quickly, and presuppose a certain familiarity with both major and minor Surrealist artists. The style of these chapters reads like an Ph.D. thesis. More illustrations of actual artwork would have been helpful, but would've driven up the cost of the book."
1,"diamonds, lying, b-movie, lost plot....ec..","Although I am not a fan of any of the actors involved with this movie I have been spending alot of time trying to find it. I was looking for a telly savalas movie from 1975 called ""Diamond Mercenaries"" and the reason was that I own a landrover and they destroy many series landrovers in this film. Like I said it was a b-movie although an allstar cast but without the plot to match"
1,Racing wheel attachment,"Poor product overall. This attachment is supposed to allow lap placement, which it does, but moves around far too much when manipulating the pedals and turning sharply. You find yourself squeezing your thighs together to keep the wheel steady. I cannot recommend this product."
3,"Potentially useful book, but problems with the answer key","I bought this book before beginning a government internship in Spain. It is potentially valuable to those who wish to be reacquainted with the fundamentals of Spanish grammar, particularly those of us who studied Spanish in high school but have not dealt with it since.The problem is the answer key. The Revised Edition has one, but with countless errors and misprints.My advice is to wait for yet another edition to appear which addresses these problems--until then spend your $15 elsewhere."
2,Bad Karas option with bad sound quality,I bought this CD and also The Third Man Theme & Other Viennese Favorites. There is NO COMPARISON in the sound quality between the two - this one sucks! I NEVER play this CD as it sounds terrible and also has a much worse compilation of songs. Scroll down and purchase The Third Man Theme & Other Viennese Favorites instead!
1,English cheese,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Man this album is so bad i can't see why anyone would take these guys seriously. They can't write songs to save there life. I'm not even going to say anything else about it. All I can say is this is some of the worst metal I have ever heard. They should put this crap out of print. This is so bad it really deserves no stars but amazon is making me give it at most one. (...)
5,been there....in person,"I've lived this book. I'm the daughter of the author and ate these things that she made. I was a teenager and picky as most. My mom made these things appealing to not ONE, but 3 teenagers and a elementary school age kid. Even tho I'm not a vegetarian any longer, I still find myself using my mom's book even now for those things that are comfort foods to myself.All recipes are tried and true, and taste REAL."
2,Think twice,"This is not the original Stormy Weather that lit up Northwest Indiana back in the 1970's. People from East Chicago Indiana, remember the groups that sang by Sardi's on Main and 139th. Acappella music was not meant to be sung with musical instruments, and revolves around pure vocal harmony. It seems the group has transformed over the years, and my opinion is they should go back to the pure sound of Acappellic music. There are few good tracts on this cd, but I'd personally save my money on this one. The ducktails of EC are washing their hairout after they listen to this album. The Ghost's of Main Street and Euclid Ave are heading for the Steel Mills just to be alone, so they could harmonize in the locker rooms and showers."
3,pretty shoes,"This is a very pretty shoe. The heel is higher than I expected, and not comfortable for standing long periods of time. A good going out to dinner and sitting down shoe."
5,Great!,"This is great book. It gives the real story behind brown vs the board of education. Also, it gives a lot of history relating to the struggles of black people in the last 100 years."
5,Must have.,"For people who like the bid older country music, Tanya Tucker 1972-97 is a must have. This CD has all the great songs on it. Cool CD. Glad I purchased it. Thanks."
2,Ordinarily Messy,"I picked up this book after finishing a thriller, merely looking to read something easy and soothing after a never-ending story. Next time I will be more careful.The repeated mentions of various food and drinks made me hungry. That was fine as they also presented ideas for scrumptious dinners. The whole story, though, was banal.I missed it completely that it was titled a ""low-carbohydrate"" novel. Popular diets especially that stress on low-carb meaning plenty of protein are not my preference. In fact, not one diet regime can be categorized as my favorite.Consuming food moderately is the best policy but apparently Harry, the troubled main character had a problem doing just that. A lot of people might share his dilemma. A few families might be experiencing the same quandary dealing with obesity. Some individuals might empathize with the family's difficulty. Many spouses might identify with the marriage mess.Not me; not yet maybe."
2,Yuck!,"First let me say that I can be very finicky about some things...and this seems to be one of them! I initially added 1 TBSP Flax Seed Oil and 1/4 tsp. cinnamon to my Zone Perfect Chocolate Shake Mix. The taste was still too strong so I am now adding only 1 tsp. I have yet to try this in salads, on veggies...which might be a better way to go with this oil which also includes rosemary and other proprietery antioxidant blend.Serving Size: 1 TBSP (1/2 Oz.)Servings per container: 32Calories: 120 per servingI have since purchased whole Flax Seeds and will probably not buy the oil again. 3 TBSP Flax Seeds has 140 calories and 7g / 29% of daily fiber!"
4,Monster cable surge protector,"Excellent product. Easy to install and works as advertised. The coax cables are a bit hard to get on (space considerations), but I do not anticipate taking them off and on."
1,BAD DEAL - SELLER NOT RECOMMENDED,"Seller sent a used item, but it was advertised as new.Product does not work.Would not buy from this seller again."
2,bad gasket,"We bought this blender a few years ago, but just recently started using it regularly to blend nutritional smoothies. Although it blends things very well and fast; for the cost of this product, I expected it to last a lot longer. The gasket around the bearing simply shredded and is not available to replace unless you purchase a new carafe altogether for $60! Not happy after spending nearly $500 on the blender to begin with. I thought the entire product was guaranteed for life, but not the case...just the blade & bearing itself is covered."
4,move over adam sandler!,"a unique blend of MUSIC, COMEDY, and WEIRDNESS. an acquired taste? but then again so is caviar! give it a try... you'll be pleasantly surprised!"
2,An amusing distraction,"This game is pretty short and goofy, to be sure. Winning overall hasn't been too tough, as the AI seems to pull punches a lot. Multiple difficulty levels would probably have been a good idea.But it's kinda fun. It's basically a series of mini-games which involve reflexes, coordination, or quick thinking tacked on to a simple strategy game of troops and resources.If I had paid real money for it I'd probably be disappointed, but as I picked if up for chunk change it's been a fun few hours. I never saw the original in its heyday, so I had no particular expectations."
4,The Last One,"Katharine Parr just wanted to marry Thomas Seymour and live a happy life. Unfortunately for her life didn't turn out like the fairy tale she had in her head. Parr was Henry VIII's last wife and the ""lucky"" one of the bunch, as she outlived him, but barely. After her stressful days as Henry's wife she was supposed to go on to her life with Thomas, and for a while did. But the ending is tragic, like all the wives Henry acquired.Overall this is a good book about a woman I've not read much on before. However I felt the book sort of stagnated in some places and in others felt very rushed. I wonder why more hasn't been written about Katharine Parr as she's the one to outlive him as a wife. I guess I got this feeling because some parts of her marriage to Henry where very stressful and others probably very pleasant. If this was the affect Plaidy was going for she achieved it."
4,"Not bad, but disappointing after the book.","I purchased this movie to go along with my sixth-grade Holocaust unit, in which we read the Jane Yolen novel on which the movie is based. The changes were a disappointment to both me and my students. In fact, of my 60 students, 59 wrote they were disappointed with the movie version after reading the book (they enjoyed the book a great deal). While the movie is not poor, it doesn't measure up to the book, but that seems to be the norm. It provided a great assignment of comparison/contrast, as mentioned by J. Potter ""Teacher with a Mission""."
5,Excellent teaching tool,"I recently saw this video on tv and can't wait to use it in my jr. high classroom. My students will identify with the character of Hannah and will gain insight into a time in history that many of them cannot fathom. The touch of fantasy will intrigue them and capture their interest. They will be as spellbound as I, even when they become aware of the outcome of the video."
4,The Devil's Arithmetic,"It is an interesting premise: modern girl meets history in a Dorothy (Wizard of Oz) meets the Holocaust kind of way, and learns about her family's history.This is a great film to teach about the horrors of the Holocaust to teens and adults."
3,I'm waiting..,I hope another set can be released with all episodes season by season box sets!!! PRETTY PLEASE UNIVERSAL!!I'll be waiting and yes willing to purchase them all...You know how to contact me :-)
3,why i aint getting it,"okay I have the pilot on dvd and the return of the hulk and the trail on dvd as well and going to get the death. the reason im not getting it is because its not all the episodes its just the favorites. now if they came out with one that has EVERY SINGLE EPISODE id probley get it. another way id get it is they came out with season 1 season 2,3,4 and so on.if you look at the bouns features youll see. THE EPISODES ARE PROBLEY BUTCHERED ANYWAY."
1,"Release ALL seasons, please","Rating this a 1 is not because Hulk is good or bad, but because whoever decided to release only these ""teasers"" deserves a ZERO rating, but Amazon doesn't allow anything less than 1. This being said, why release this ""ultimate"" thing? What's the ultimate about a small percentage of what exits and should be out on DVD? That's the Ultimate Insult to fans..."
4,Great DVD set for Hulk fans!!,"I just picked up this set today and it is impressive. It has most of the best episodes from the series.My only complaints:1. Discs aren't labeled with what episodes are on them2. ""The Snare"" and ""The Slam"" would have been nice additions3. No extrasJust minor things that prevented a 5 star rating. Still definitely worth the purchase!"
4,UNSATISFIED!!!,"That's right...I was unsatisfied! But not with this set, but with the fact that the rest of the episodes are not available!!! This set was awesome! But dissatisfying because it's missing all the rest of the best stuff!!! It's incomplete! UNIVERSAL HOME ENT: PLEASE RELEASE ALL THE SEASONS WITH REMASTERED PIC & SOUND! If they do, I'm positive they will all sell out the first day!!! I know I'll buy all the seasons!!! And the same goes for the ""Six-Million-Dollar Man"" !!!"
4,"Maybe the best mini-system around, but...","...believe it or not, my displays on the RX-E810 reciever and the DVD-E810 media player do not perfectly match. Though were are not talking about the difference between, for example, red and blue LCD displays; my RX-E810 reciever display is noticeably blue-hued, while the DVD-E810 media player is noticeably green-hued. That said, the exteriors of the two components are identical, and the sound of this system is so good (especially with the addition of the subwoofer) that it will bring tears to your eyes. Oh, and for a perfect match on the subwoofer, make sure you get the one with the ""piano finish;"" it best compliments the mini-system speakers."
3,Its OK,"I own the Celtic Mysteries disc in this series and its is brilliant, This one sad to say is just more New Age music. Shame they couldnt keep the spirit and quality as the other one. Not Bad but it doesnt live up to the other volume,"
4,Great sub for the price!!!,YOU CAN NOT BEAT THIS SUB FOR THE PRICE AND BASS.I HAVE ONE 10 IN MY TRUCK HIT LIKE A 12.
3,I've heard this much rumble and clatter from under the hood of a '76 Mustang,"Way too noisy. It DOES kinda work if you flip it ""logo-side down"". Anyways, spend the extra $15 and upgrade to something better. you won't regret it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"I have never written a review before, and generally balance out the positive and negative reviews when considering a purchase. But this laptop cooling pad just arrived today, and I am AMAZED at how awful it is.First, the unit is covered in scratches, the top half is almost unglued from the bottom half and one of the LED lights in the USB hub does not work. The supplied AC adapter does not fit the unit either, and it is not quiet in the least. And the real kicker -- when I connect the pad to my laptop with a USB cable, my laptop immediately turns off and will not turn on until I unplug the USB cable! Wow.I knew it was cheap, but I mainly ordered because it was small enough to fit under my macbook. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra $10 for a legit cooling pad."
4,Really enjoyed it,"I really enjoyed ""It Happened One Autumn"" I think it is really romantic and cute It's the first book of its kind that I ever read and I really Loved it."
3,An average book,"I found this second installment of the Wallflower stories pretty bland. It wasn't bad, by any means, but nor was it shatteringly good. Lillian Bowman is the feisty American heiress destined to shake up and melt the heart of the deceptively stodgy, proper British aristocrat, Marcus Westcliff. Their romance is predictable, and I ended up skimming a lot - a bad sign. I'm beginning to become more familiar than I would like with what is rapidly cementing into a formula for Kleypas - the tone of the stories, the characters, and the events (the author seems partial to final climactic scenes in which either the hero or heroine is placed in and saved from grave danger) all are blurring together for me after reading a few of her books. Mine Till Midnight is still my favorite (mostly for Cam), but these others are sadly nondescript."
5,One of the best.,"This CD gives praise and connection from Ancient African Wisdom to Current day Hip-Hop Music. Even though this, Professor-X, The X-Clan, and Brother-J, are not out there now, their musical genius extends throughout time."
4,A terrific observer of the human condition,"A great read , especially when Michael jump's to what he really is thinking , his personal insights into cultures and the differences between them . Though I have to admit his section on India was by far the most intresting read for me as I was familiar with the content he wrote about, therefore it does enhance the read if you have visited or had some experience with some of these cultures.."
3,"Not bad, not great","I have struggled with finding a good chest radiography book and had my hopes pinned on this one. The good is that it is well-organized and the chapters are of a manageable length. The end-of-chapter summaries are great and the charts with differential diagnoses are comprehensive yet not intimidating. The bad is that the images, particularly the radiographs, are of suboptimal quality. Not infrequently, I would struggle to even see the obvious finding in the figure. ""Fine reticular opacities"" look not much different from ""coarse reticular opacities."" While it is convenient that the book is rather small in dimension, the images are likewise small, too small. This book succeeds in explaining how to differentiate rather nonspecific findings in chest radiography (a major plus). It falls short in reproducing those findings visually. You can't do that in radiology."
4,No random hair pulls....,"The brush is a one piece construction, which means there is nothing that will randomly grab and pull your hair. I have a conair brush, but it's a two piece construction. I have long hair and my hair always got caught and wrapped up in the conair brush. Very frustrating. The brush is great for the ends of my hair, or just basic styling - however, it doesn't exactly grab your hair enough to do just a basic brush out and that's the only reason I gave it 4 stars. It is very gently on your hair, one piece wooden construction is perfect...but I do have to have a different brush to make sure my hair is brushed out and ready for styling"
5,High quality Torx set,"Well, the review has to contain 20 words, so this sentence should help. This is a high quality Torx set. Got it for my Jeep hardtop, works great, and will come in handy for other uses and last a lifetime."
1,defective receiver,"Yamaha 6090 received recieved but will not power on, returned item to seller.Seller confirmed receiver was received.Looking for credit for the received that was paid for."
1,example pages,I am interested in Foundations of Music but I'm not going to purchase it without being able to look at a few pages.
5,Another Winner for Lorrie,"Lorrie Morgan's 1997 album SHAKIN' THINGS UP is a great album, and usually overlooked. It includes the hit ""Go Away"", which is one of her most compelling singles in the past 5 years. The album features a good mixture of uptempo songs, and ballads. Some of the best uptempo songs include ""Finishing Touch"", ""One Of Those Nights Tonight"", and ""I'm Not That Easy To Forget"". The best ballads include ""In A Perfect World"", ""Crazy From The Heat"", ""You Cant Take That"" and her version of ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow"". Overall this is a great album that no fan should be without, and country music fans might want to look into this to see what they are missing out on!"
4,Is there an assassin's retirement home?,"The Matador was a surprisingly funny, R-rated comedy that makes the viewer feel sorry for a paid assassin.As a ""facilitator of fatalities,"" Pierce Brosnan is the perfect actor. He demonstrates great breath and ability in this movie. He is still that ""James Bond"" ladies man, but it has to be because of his smooth talking (and his bankroll).My complaint is the ending. I don't want to write anything here to ruin it for you, but there is something placed under a window wiper. It has significance. Is it something the assassin is giving up? Is it the equivalent of a business card? If it was spontaneous, is it one t***** or two? What did I miss here? What? Not even my viewing buddies could help me with this one.The scene of Pierce walking through the hotel lobby in his bathing suit and ankle high boots has been seared in my memory."
4,"A Very Funny, Quirky Film -- Much Better Than Expected","Pierce Brosnan as a top assassin who is burned out and undergoing a psychological meltdown -- very funny stuff. I particularly liked it because it's not AT ALL what one would expect from ""James Bond.""As for the acting, Brosnan is perfect -- completely amoral and tasteless when he needs to be, uncontrollably anxiety-prone when he shouldn't be. Greg Kinnear is very good, although it's a role that a lot of other actors could have done at least as well. Hope Davis is also good, but again vastly overshadowed by Brosnan's appropriately over-the-top performance.My only warning is to parents -- take the R rating seriously. Part of being an amoral, hired killer who chases (and catches) girls in every country is that there is a lot of language that's perfect for the character but probably not so perfect for your kids."
2,not my type,"For some reason, i liked the first half, but then the second half lost me... i just could not say interested."
4,brosnan is top notch,"I can't say much more than what hasn't already been said . I pretty much agree with all the previous reviews , even some of the ones that are critical . Bottom line , Brosnan is amazing here . It is more comedic than anything else but his character is so believable I can't even describe how much so . Bravo to him ."
5,A wonderful surprise!,"I was not a Pierce Brosnan fan before this movie, but I am now! Greg Kinnear is terrific in this quirky movie, too. The plot line of the movie was not at all what I expected. There were twists and turns that kept me interested from start to finish. Don't pass on this movie because you think it's just another violent, ""Hit-Man"" flick- because it's not. There's more to it than that. I ventured out of my comfort zone to watch this movie and I'm glad I did."
5,Just perfect.,"You can get deep into this movie or just veg on it, either way, it's perfect. A favorite of all time."
4,Hilarious!,I thought this movie was just hilarious the first time I saw it. Pierce Brosnan shines and shows that he is more than just 007. He was hilarious as the sleazy assassin going thru a midlife crisis.I recommend this movie to just about any adult that likes good slighty naughty humor.
4,A good comedy,"Pierce Brosnan is a lonely but likeable, if foul-mouthed, assassin who forms an unlikely friendship with a rather unsuccessful businessman. The whole thing is very amusing and there are several unexpected twists in the tail. I enjoyed it very much."
1,Absolute Drivel,Unbeliveable drivel from 2 fabulous actors. I couldn't even finish the film. Contrived and riduculous attempts at humor. I couldn't stop from cringing. What a disapointment after Brosnan in Thomas Crown and Kinnear in many great films. Total waste of time.
4,"She's sweet, 16, & simply loves her daddy...She'll slaughter you if you love him too!","A suprisingly good (& undeservingly obscure) B-movie gem. Underated canadian actress Isabelle Mejias dominates this thriller as a disturbed young lady who loves her dad a little to much, and will do anything to keep him all to herself. Sybil Danning plays her stepmother & Anthony Fransciosa play her dad. Also known as Bad Blood & Daughter Of Death, and directed by Paul Nicolas (Chained Heat, The Naked Cage) this is far less exploitive than you might think, sort of an '80's ""Bad Seed"". This DVD is only okay, the movie is not remastered, the sound is murky, & no special features, but still worth getting (Cheap!). A lost classic."
3,The LSO ain't a great jazz ensemble,"If this is the only rendition of these Gerswhin pieces you've heard, then you'll probably be satisfied; however if you have a copy of Jeffrey Siegel with Leonard Slatkin and the Saint Louis Symphony, then you might be less charmed by Previn's approach and you could well be downright disappointed by some of the orchestral playing, particularly the brass and woodwinds. The sound quality is not ideal either, the piano relentlessly dominant, and the orchestral details indistinct, and despite the very recent remastering there is an edginess to the sound that is unnatural and distracting. For mine, definitely not one of the great recordings of the century."
2,Not Like Before,I used Jade East for years starting in 1965. A few years ago I found it again and it wasn't quite as good as before. This time I find it to not even be close to the way it was before. It's a Very Weak quality. Not sure I will ever buy again.
5,Old School II,"On par with the cologne, this is the real thing from years gone by. Light enough for daily wear."
4,VANtastic HALEN show !!!,"This is Van Halen at the pinnacle of their musical prowess. No explosions, no massive light show, no Vegas showroom clown, just Van Halen doing what they do best. A must for any Van Halen, a must for any rock fan, if you don't have it-get it!"
3,"Gay sci-fi ""classic"" by a Hollywood actor pal of Rock Hudson","If you like your male characters steaming-hot and hunky, this odd, one-of-a-kind (?) science fiction thriller by actor George Nader is for you. Evey encounter between the two heroes of this dystopian tale, set in the future, is filled with eroticism of the male-to-male kind. Vivid, highly-charged, (and sometimes, downright silly), descriptions of characters and locales.Definitely not for all tastes, but a sincere effort by a gay Hollywood actor who never achieved real stardom, but was a reliably masculine, (read ""hot""), Hollywood icon. Too bad his ""tell-all"" book on Hollywood was never published."
1,Doesn't even deserve that star!,This is the worst book I have ever read. Which must mean it's pretty bad because I read constantly. I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone.
1,This book was the biggest joke,Had to give it a star and I really wish I didn't have to and this is why.This was the worst book I have ever read and if you think it was any good you must have been paid to do so. I heard that there unfortunately be a sequel to this garbage if there is any justice maybe the character will die that way we will no longer have to read the garbage. This is just your typical loser who makes it big in his own mind. What a waste.
1,beyond reason,Irony: looking to the Roman Catholic Church for advice on how to not be gay. This is like getting parenting advice from Michael Jackson. I don't think so.
1,Horrid,"I bought this game way back and recently played it again.. well..the game was easy to beat when i was 6 and its still as easy.Well, my problem(s)?Not enough characters and its just not very fun and.. yeah that makes it boring.. but if ur a fan of the older games ( like me ) you may like this game ( unlike me )It's cheap now so, I guess it wouldn't hurt to pick it up.. it costs as much cash as to rent a game at the videostore..so do what you want with it."
2,"Good Idea, But Doesn't Work for One Year Old","There are some good qualities to the blocks. The blocks are colorful and durable, although the clear plastic ones are not waterproof and cannot be submerged for cleaning or bath time. The blocks stick together very well, although they are a bit too difficult to separate for my son. They work well only when aligned in one direction; all the vehicles facing up or all facing down when stacking all 5. If you have a combination of up and down they won't line up and fall over easily. Forget about trying to stack them on their sides because the plastic is too slippery. These may work out better once my son is older and understands that they should face one direction, but at 14 months he's still having trouble. Regular wooden blocks work better for him to stack. Also, the blue plastic base is a good idea and adds stability when playing on a flat surface or rug. However, it's a bit too small and is not stable if playing on more uneven surfaces."
3,Un-pleasurable Reading,I found this book to be rather boring. It feels as if the author repeats the same thought over and over again until it fill up the whole book. In a way it's like chanting if you are into that sort of thing. My own pleasure prescription is to read something more pleasurable.
4,Native American Legend,The legend of the origin of the beautiful Texas flower called the Indian Paintbrush. A good addition to Native American studies.
3,not user friendly,The techniques are good. The videography is one dimensional. Cannot see all the techniques. No distinct muscles are addressed in the menu of this dvd so... I have a cllent coming in with specific needs. In order for me to find the stretches specific to this clients needs one must watch the entire video! This is not a user friendly dvd. Also the therapist does not verbalize what muscles he is addressing. over all its okay.
5,license plate frame,"As advertised. I used it for a pop up trailer. It holds a license plate, which is what it is intended to do. Its zinc plated steel, so it should last a while. 5 stars because..well, why not? It works!"
5,Wonderful book!,Abbie returns to her hometown to recover from a failed love affair and becomes enamored with the town's handsome new minister.
2,It's a Flat version. Does not have the UMPH!!! Of Live shows,"I expected the strong Version of Wild Horses and Black Cars, but it's more of a tranquil Sunday Evening Friends get together than a Live show."
2,WHAT?,"I am glad JLA:TAS finally got a line. I was dissapointed at the fact that there were no villans. Also what in the heck is the deal with these stands. I don't care what the letters spell. Why are the figures in a 4.5"" scale? Not even the first toy biz Marvel SuperHeroes were that small. To quote The Hurricane: ""Wassup wit dat?"" The figures themselves look like they came right from an old N64 game. These figures do not give their cartoon counterparts justice at all. It' true, it's true.Plus the don't have much posability to them. They should have a long shelf life as well as a long clearance life."
2,Not a book I would want to read again,"I read this book many years ago and remember it as a story about an ambitious, self-seeking, ego-driven young vicar who alientates his wife and causes trouble all around, from which he has to be rescued by an enemy.I don't recall any pleasure in reading it."
3,"Iron Man - Armored Adventures, Vol. 2",Tony Stark is a teenager in High School...My son enjoyed that whole concept and it was a good intro to the adult Tony Stark. Not bad if you're a kid:)
3,Scott's Review,All of the books I ordered have arrived and I would like to thank everyone for their efforts.
2,Sloppy,"This book is not completely useless. It does tell you something about models that are used in finance. But the title misleads: there is a lot of description of models, but not much on estimation and inference procedures.There is a general air of editorial sloppiness in a combination of factual errors, grammatical slips, awkward language and inscrutable logic. For example, on p.36 a process is defined to be I(1) iff its first difference is a weak white noise. And on p.172 there is this: ""It is likely the asset prices to [sic] follow a nonstationary process, whereas the dividends and the excess gains are stationary processes."" Huh? In the discussion of the consumption-based CAPM money and a price level are inexplicably included. Things of this kind recur through out."
4,Totally Worth It!,"For some reason, my youngest adores this movie (Ashley Tisdale annoys me). Couldn't find it anywhere (that I cared to look). It arrived on time, as advertised, and he loves it!"
4,Enteraining kids movie,I enjoyed the movie very much and enjoyed watching with my daughter. I enjoyed the movie and especailly enjoyed the fight between grandma and whats his name. It fit and was wonderful.
3,Good movie but it wont be watched several times.,Its basically as the previews set it out to be. Aliens in the attic. Not as funny as I thought it would be and my kids seemed to like it but it definitely isnt a repeat movie like Monsters Inc.
4,Better than I expected,I was prepared for a B or C grade kids vs aliens. But the story was interesting and the kids were not morons. I liked the hints at ET and other sci-fi movies. It kept my interest and I liked the McGiver style innovations to battle the aliens.
4,YES-Now THAT'S What I'm Talkin' About!!!!!,"Actually, I give this one 4.5 stars. I think it is a sexy blend of up tempo and slow songs. Soulful and bluesy, but urban and gritty, too-southern gentility well-combined with the raw sensuality and vulnerability that makes you want to know more-just like those bad boys you see walking around. This is a wonderful showcase of the Hailey brothers' ability to harmonize and compliment each other artistically and emotionally I own all 4 K-Ci and Jojo CD's and this is, by far, the best. As time went on, they seemed to have forgotten the things that make us love them so much-like the emotions they can stir with their sincerity and the freakiness that makes us ladies swoon. Perhaps they were experimenting on the later efforts. Or maybe they were trying to distance themselves from their youthful raunchiness, in an effort to be taken more seriously-but I say if it ain't broke don't fix it. This is some good stuff, right here."
2,Not what I expected,"I had heard so many good things about ""Love Always"", and I never bought it. So when ""It's Real"" came out, I went and bought it. I am disappointed. There are only four tracks on here that I like, and my favorite one is the last one, Momma's Song, written by their mother. So I guess if U want to waste UR money on a CD, U should buy this one. Other than that, leave it alone!"
1,STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN HORRIBLE,They are the worst pair of voices on radio today. Someone should reclaim these fools record contracts.
5,Check this out!,I accidentally ran across this CD and it is great! I am really excited to find something like this especially since I had never heard of Love Riot before. So Beautiful is a great song and the music rocks.
4,Perfect for the starting musician,"I got this for my brother as a gift. He's just starting to play the guitar and is taking lessons so he needed a case. Not only was it a great price but it's also a really nice soft case that has a pouch for all his knickknacks. The only thing is if he gets a bigger guitar, not sure it's going to fit, but I will definitely checkout more World Tour items when that day comes."
2,this movie should never have existed,Not even the same team is used from the first two movies. Most of the original actors no better than to go anywhere near this awful third installment. If you want to see a good baseball movie watch the first two but avoid this movie at all costs.
3,Great clips.... little else,It is a book companion not a text or reference. Good clips are present for example of common U/S situations......
3,Good on technique but that's only 1/3 of book.,"The section on technique is quite good and helpful, but this comprises only about 60 pages of the 190-page book. The bulk of the book is on Themes (e.g. portraits, landscapes, animals, etc.) and this section doesn't offer much more than some pretty pictures and a few comments about each theme."
5,Again..A MUST HAVE!!!!,"One of a few Pastel books that include Oil Pastels. Even though it is not 'comprehensive,' there is enough little pointers scattered about the book to be a worthwhile read and reference."
5,THE Airwar story of World War 2,"I have read this book two to three times a year since 1968, and just finished it again. The one copy I have had over the years has fallen apart, and the book is rubber banded together.This title should be required reading in Jr Hi to teach children what americans have been through to become the people we are today,as will as to salute this ""Greatest Generation"". The characters are three dimentional, and touch you like no others will again. When I read this book, it is like sitting down and visiting with an old friend. I will never get tired of this tale. This story is one that will live forever in your heart."
1,Pastiche With Panaceas,"The author seems to have taken whatever she found attractive from many psychological theories and cobbled them together. Judgments are pronounced and sweeping generalizations issued without factual support. For example, persons who decide to leave an abusive relationship are determined to live their lives in guilt, and are condescendingly referred to as having done what they needed to do to survive. Apparently staying in the abusive relationship, armed with positive affirmations and deep breathing, is the nobler course. It is unfortunate that this topic has been neglected by the social services community. It would be very helpful to see a peer reviewed work, but this is not it."
4,Dark Transfer secret,"Like other customers, I was frustrated by trying to separate the transfer from the backing. I found a video from England that suggested a different process. Print the transfer. BUT, before you trim it, pull the backing down to the point where the design begins. (This is much easier because the transfer is looser, and it's easier to pull up an edge. Then, put the transfer back and trim. I think the trimming process really binds the two surfaces together. I even took a small piece of the ironing paper in between the two surfaces before trimming. The rest is easy. It's a good idea to wash the shirt first if it's a dark color so the color doesn't bleed through to the transfer."
5,Saved my Halloween costume!,"I was dressing as a 90's grunge/alternative guy, and the finishing touch I needed for my costume was a T-Shirt from some long gone 90's band. I went to every thrift store I could find and not a single band shirt was to be found. Finally while driving home in defeat, I realized I might be able to just make my own T-Shirt. I stopped by the store on the way home to see what they had, and I grabbed a pack of these transfers and some new black T shirts. I had never made my own shirt in the past, but 20 easy minutes later, VOILA! I had a brand new Candlebox t-shirt! And it looks surprisingly good! I highly recommend this product."
4,Avery T-shirt transfers are great!!,Before buying Avery brand I have bought cheaper T-shirt iron-transfers only to be woefully disappointed. Since sticking with Avery I have had 10 perfect T-shirt projects completed. This specific brand is great since you do not have to print in reverse. The trick though is (1) Follow their directions carefully and (2) Patience in peeling off the transfer from the paper backing. If Avery made a tiny little tab like point where it would be simpler to peel off the transfer this product would be perfect.
1,Don't waste your money on this product,"If the words DISAPPOINTING and DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, (appearing in all caps) encourage you to not buy this product, then I have done a good deed.I thought these looked promising. After all, I have used many traditional iron-on transfers created by ink-jet printers. I thought these would be good, too.They did not work.Printing was fine, trimming was fine, separating the adhesive backing from the art work was a disaster. The process bordered on stripping wall paper and we had similar results. The art work tore, the backing paper would start to peel, and then it would come apart and stick to the art work. We searched in vain for a good way to get the two pieces apart and finally, the only satisfying option was wadding up the three (YES THREE) pages and dropping them unceremoniously in the trash.Perhaps in a few more years, Avery will fix this product. For now, don't waste your money."
1,Color Bleeding on Dark Shirts,"I've printed about 10 shirts using Avery's Dark Shirt Transfers. I have been disappointed in every single one. The shirt color bleeds through any light colored part of the design making the end product look washed-out and dingy. I've talked to Avery about the problem but they offer no solution other than sending me more paper to offset the paper I've used. I have tried every trick I know of to get it right: Shortening ironing time, less pressure, washing or not washing the shirts first but every result is the same. Avery products work great on light colored fabrics but are terrible on dark colors. A red shirt with any white in the design and you wind up with a pink design and so on and so on. Perhaps other brands won't have this problem but I have not checked them out. It gets too expensive to keep buying shirts and paper just to have another disappointing end product."
1,Couldn't separate backing - threw it out!,"My paper was over a year old, and maybe that had something to do with it, when I tried to use it - I couldn't get the transfer paper off either."
2,Won't last in the dryer; peels and cracks,"After several washings and spins in the dryer, the iron-ons will peel and crack on the clothing. You might still get decent results with pre-shrunk clothes (wash & dry first) and then always plan to hang dry them after the artwork has been applied. Don't dry Avery iron-ons in the dryer; they will be destroyed in no time."
2,HER VOICE IS NOT ALL THAT !,"After watching Grenique video and hearing her song should I, I thought that her voice was good, but after buying her CD and listening to her I was not impress with her singing. I think she has the voice but need a song writer. Her songs were boring. If you want to be annoyed listen to her cd."
2,Not much there besides the promise it fails to live up to,"Not really a novel, more a collection thoughts that are all too often repetitive. How often can we read this monk berate himself for being afraid to travel? Cut out all the redundancies and you end up with a pleasant, quirky short story. It does not live up to its promise because it is never more than superficial about the knowledge it purports and the philosophy it would have the reader believe it is pondering."
3,"great sound, poor packaging","excelent quality and sound, but really poor packaging, the strings dindt came in the usuall ernie ball's aluminium bag so they will rust in a few weeks..."
5,Excellent,"Everything submitted about this book is right on point. I just received it and it is a beautiful publication.It must also be mentioned that besides all of the fantastic photography and art direction overall, the words on idealism contributed by such illustrious thinkers and revolutionaries as Ralph Nader, Cornel West, Ian MacKaye, Al Sharpton, and Ian Svenonius, truly emphasize the viewpoint of the author Friedman as eloquently and as insightfully as you can imagine. Simply inspiring words to pepper this incredibly colorful book."
3,Dry reading,"I found this book going into detail I didn't find all that interesting. I was looking for an overview, sort like flying over the country, and this book kept landing a small airports. If you are really interested in the nitty gritty I guess it would be a good addition to a library."
1,Extremely Bias and Ignorant !!!,A blind(ignorant) fundamentalist christian trying to lead other people.The author of this book seems to be a republican or member of a right wingconservative organization. The scary thing about my previous comments isMs Elreta Dodds is African American. The enemies of progress must love herdearly.
5,she keeps getting better,"Kristin Hersh has dug deep and managed to combine the best of the Throwing Muses and her solo work in one album. As a longtime fan who was slightly disappointed with her last solo release (Strange Angels), this album definitely did not let me down. Intoxicating."
1,Unpleasant Buying Experience,"This has been a very unpleasant e-commerce buying experience. It has changed my mind about purchasing some items on line. I ordered some Roper boots from Bargain Outfitters. They came in a timely manner, when I tried them on they did not fit me. I decided to send them back immediately and because there was no address other than the one on the box and it was the same on the paper insert that was given to me, that is where I sent it back. I sent it UPS ground and it was delivered the next day. That was 3 weeks ago. I am still waiting for my refund because they are busy and can't get around to finding this box and refunding my money. I am wondering if I will ever receive a refund and what my recourse is going to be."
3,pretty good!,"""The Last of Mohicans"" bu James Cooper was an interesting novel, about French-Indian war. It kind of reminded me of Pocahontas, but yet this is much more interesting. One of the parts that kept me on reading were when Duncan, a major in the English army who had to guard the daughters of his enemies, goes on to save Alice, who was kidnapped. He finally manages to escape and still has to fight. Eventually there is more conflict going with a suprising ending. Kind of made me sad, 'cause I didn't want it to end like that.I would definitely recommend it for those who like legend stories, fightings and battles in the war."
3,Works but is poorly made,"I just got this product and for the price I am not pleased. The back swivel piece was already separating apart, upon further inspection it just looks cheaply put together and sounds like it too. Overall, I have been using it for a day and it does the job but as other reviews suggest, its not worth the money."
1,Terrible laptop stand,I bought this as a Christmas present. It will NOT stay together. The laptop pad comes apart from the stand every time you move. I wish I had saved my receipt. I would demand a refund.
5,What a simple little item!!!,"I was hesitant to pay $45 for this piece of aluminum with two cushions. However, let me say it is well worth the price. Such a simple little contraption that makes a world of difference when typing. Whether I place it on my lap, whether it is on a table, if I'm reclining in my bed, it makes a world of difference in my typing, with my wrists and really does absorb the heat from my MacBook Pro. The person who came up with this idea must be raking in the dough, but God bless him/her! Unless you ONLY type on a desk, this item is a must have!"
3,"Sturdy, attractive, but not height adjustable",Very nice looking. Perfectly fit for the 15inch mac. I only use it on the desk and removed the front pad. I just wish I could raise it to higher degrees of elevation at times.
3,Does not work well with the MacBook Air,"I used an iLap with my 12"" PB and loved it but unfortunately I have not had the same experience with the combination of this iLap model and my MacBook Air. It just doesn't fit the Air well. With the front, round pad in place, your wrists are forced into an uncomfortable arch over the pad to reach the Air keyboard. WIthout the pad, the tilt of the iLap is too great and the lid of the Air cannot be opened far enough to get a good viewing angle. In addition, I don't know why they got rid of the velcro attachment for the removable front pad. Now there is an inscrutable grooved plastic attachment that takes forever to connect. The velcro was noisy but effective."
1,Broken and refurb looking,"Only one side of the LED's worked, looked used. Package was taped up. Also didn't come with the correct powercord to plug into my xbox 360 on the motherboard. Garbage."
2,aurora blue-blue is right,thinking that this would make the xbox 360 cool looking only to find out that it requires the opening of the xbox!
4,good book,"its informative,not as informative as i thought it would be,but still a good book for an apprentice,has most of the basics in it"
5,Rock N' Roll! Good thing you can't wear out CD's!,"I've been a Quo fan since the beginning of their illustrious career. Of all the albums they've put out, this is the best! My personal favorites are Keep 'Em Coming, Making Waves and Round and Round. These songs are 100% pure adreniline Status Quo. Makes you want to pick up a guitar, bang on some drums or get to tapping your feet at the very least. Little White Lies is as catchy a tune as Quo have done. Tracks like Twenty Wild Horses, Under The Influence, and Little Me and You would be standouts on most Quo albums, if not for the spectacular songs I've already mentioned. Fans of Quo will love it and those who don't know about Status Quo should give it a try. You will not be disappointed!"
3,Where's the beef?,"I purchased this book in the digital version, being too impatient to wait for delivery. I soon found that supreme patience was required to ferret out the information I was looking for.First the good news: the (e)book is thorough and structured. A lot of valuable details are brought to focus. If you are seeking information on the mechanics of organizing and running a focus group, I think this would be a good start.However, I also want to know how to collect data from a Focus Group, and how to interpret the data. This it turns out is a research project in and of itself, since this information is scattered in various chapters, and the formal discussion only begins on page 87.I eventually found the information I was looking for, although the level of detail was a bit thin. I just find it fascinating that a book intended to serve the advertising industry has it's punchline on page 87."
5,Yummy,"This is SPARKLY stuff! I actually think it is a bit too sparkly, but it is pretty, just definitely noticeable. The scent is not as strong as I expected, but nice nonetheless. My husband says it tastes good, which was an issue with the honey dust I had tried to use in the past. Will definitely recommend to anyone who likes to smell and taste yummy."
1,Horrible,This is the second worst CD I have ever purchased the only redeeming Charecteristics is the free CD and the Free video tape of Pras video which i have already recorded over. NO lyrics NO beats NO Good.If your wondering which CD was worse it was Freestlye fellowships album.
1,Save Your Cash This CD Sucks,"I downloaded this album for free on Mp3 and I don't normally bother to dis wack albums but this s*** is wack as hell... there is not one solid track on the album... If you like the Fugees... buy the Lauryn Hill album it's much better... As for Pras, don't even bother. In case you are one of those Ghetto Superstar nuts... just buy the bullworth soundtrack it has the same joint. Personally I think Ghetto Superstar is wack, yet sadly... it is probably the best track on this album... I give this album 1 star cuz 0 stars wasn't an option !!"
5,one of my favorite cds,"if you liked ghetto supastar, the song, then definitly buy this album, its chock fulla energy filled beats and outta all my cds, my hard core, my shameless sell outs, and just bizarre albums, this is one of my top 5 favorite albums"
3,mmmmmm..........,"This c.d. is okay. I only like one song which is ""Ghetto Supastar."" This c.d. is not that great."
1,Just Awful,This CD is just awful. What a letdown. The music sounds as though it was composed on an 80's Casio keyboard (I'll apologize to Casio)and the vocals are pure hack. There is no emotion and the singers sound as though they are reading from the songbook. I'll usually give anything with the Buffett name a chance but this is pure trash. I only hope that this doesn't stop someone else from putting together a proper Buffett cover album because it would be a great idea.
1,Horrible Horrible Horrible - What a Bummer!,"I love reggae and I love Buffett. What a disapointment. There is so much potential for a good Reggae cover album but this is just cruise ship garbage. No, it's not even that good, it's worse than the guy pool side playing his casio keyboard to a boring drum track - STAY AWAY!!!!"
2,Pass it by...,"I am a huge Parrot Head. This year will mark my 22nd year of concert attendance. But, this CD just doesn't cut it. You may need it for that completist CD collection, but you probably will never listen to it."
2,Unreadable,"I have read this book in both English and Spanish translations. The English version is almost unreadable. The author should have employed an English speaking editor. Sometimes it is hard to figure out what the author is trying to say. Because of the difficulty finding books with Santeria myths in English, this book might be of value to someone very curious about that religion. But, be warned, it is not well written."
3,Nice Picture...,"This TV has a good picture. Good color and nice an bright. You can see some light around the edges of the screen, especially on dark pictures. The remote is awful. The layout is bad and the keys are tiny. The sound is a little tinny and doesn't have much bass."
4,Pretty good,"Nice picture (not HD). The menus are rather limited, and the remote is very basic and feels cheaply made.After a while, I decided to hang the set on a wall. It was a big hassle to remove the base, but then it was easy to mount to a wall bracket."
3,OK MOVIE FOR THOSE COMING OF THAT AGE,Maybe I was expecting something else. This movie I gave away after watching it. Perhaps becuase I'm over 40 I simply was not moved by it. But for those who are approaching that societal age of 30 I imagine it would be enjoyable.
2,Really disappointing,"I actually got this movie when it came out and I paid like $20 something for it. When I watched it I was very disappointed. I really got it to see all the good actors in it. It goes to show just because there is good actors in a movie doesn't mean it will be a good script or movie because of that fact. I thought it would be more in-depth with the characters but it wasn't. You have Tracy Morgan as a struggling comedian who is a promiscuous person who brings no real depth to the story, although he was funny. Then you have the sexy Allen Payne who plays a pretty boy who sleeps with a lot of women but no depth. See where I'm going here? Out of the whole movie I only believed Erika Alexander's character. It just looks like a movie that was put together without much thought to a real plot. I didn't get it, not one of the best movies, needless to say I took the movie back and got a credit for the amount I paid for it. I gave it 2 stars because sexy Allen Payne was in it."
2,"Great Geographer, Mediocre Book","There is no doubt that Mercator was a great geographer. Among his achievements were: the projection bearing his name, the first modern Atlas, and even the naming of North America. He played an important role in the amazing successes and adventures of the Age of Discovery. He truly was an amazing man.Having said this, I found Crane's book to be lacking. I thought that the book was well researched and well grounded, but the delivery was poor. When buying a popular history book, in addition to the facts I expect a gripping story, masterfully told. However, Crane's writing style is dry and while the book is filled with names, dates, facts and figures the story telling is simply not there. Crane often gets bogged down in minute details that are distracting, dry and are simply not important to the story he is trying to tell.In short, this may be a good history book, but it is not a book that I would recommend for the typical reader of POPULAR history."
3,Mercator el Hombre,"Interesante y constructiva visión del hombre que dío las bases de la cartografía mundial, una muy buena y completa biografía de un geografo mundial"
1,THE WORST!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"Saw this last night on Encore Family..3 1/2 hours I will never get back.You will not need sleeping pills if you try and watch this.. Save your money and your time...watch the original ""THE WIZARD OF OZ"""
1,Give me my time back,"Had the mischance of seeing this film, hoping it was based on one of the many OZ books. Nope. It's a cheezy, poorly written exploitation of the OZ series. While Dorothy is very pretty, everyone's acting is painful, the makeup and special effects below par and the plot.... plot?There are so many good films out there and better yet, a LOT of OZ books to read. Time is better spent elsewhere"
4,The very first album!,"This is actually a re-release of the first ever Golden Earring(s) album, released somewhere in 1964/65.Although I actually don't enjoy this vintage Earring stuff that much I can really recommend it to any Earring completist. My favourite periods of Earring music are early seventies, late seventies/early 80s and all of their 90s output up til now.The sound on this first album is similar to the first British Invasion bands, including Beatles, Searchers and Hollies.The bonus tracks are a mix of early singles & b-sides but very representative for that period of time.The line up of the group already included George Kooymans and Rinus Gerritsen. Lead singer Frans Krassenburg left early 1967 and was replaced by Barry Hay and Cesar Zuiderwijk joined the Earring in 1970."
2,Not recommended.,My wife has MS and uses a walker on Tile floor in the house. These wheels stick when she tries to slide the walker sideways and almost made here fall. They are too narrow. Get fater wheels.
3,dumond facts,"after reading others reviews i thought i needed to say some things are correct and others not. for example wayne dumond did not live in a trailer he lived in a 3 br red home. how do i know? well, i am married to his son."
3,Good Info,"If you already have read a thick TCP/IP study guide, then this book is perfect as a review the day before the test. It covers all the exam objectives clearly. But again, don't depend only on this book to pass the test."
3,Vague,"First off, I purchased this book based upon reading ""MCSE Exam Notes Networking Essentials"" by Madow/Chellis, which was an excellent review book that only covered areas on the exam. The Enterprise book covered every objective/topic but was vague on what you would actually see on the exam. I purchased the book to ""review"" the testable topics on the MCSE exam not to learn it for the first time. On a positive note, I really like the format that Sybex has come up with... the detail-review-test method really works for me."
5,Organizing from the Right Side of the Brain,"This book is AWESOME. I didn't realize that there were ""certain characteristics"" that we Right Brainers have in common. It was a very interesting and insightful book. It makes me wonder how much of my issues are really ADD or just perhaps Right Brained features. Book written so you can jump around and read chapters in different order than written."
5,Super deal on a good quality mortar and pestle set,"My daughter needed a mortar and pestle set to grind up large pills for her big dogs, and I needed one as well for preparing herbs. I researched what was available online and was delighted to find this grouping of three sets in graduated sizes for about half the cost of other single sets of similar or lesser quality. We split the sets between us and they more than meet our needs."
5,It perfect!,The product was exactly as represented to be. It was shipped super fast. Altogether a great place to shop!!!
1,Mortar & Pestle for a Child,"I grind various size pills daily from 1/2 baby aspirin to large, hard caplets. I have used the standard marbel mortar & pestle for 10+ years but it can hurt your hands with the large pills and the small pills get lost in the bottom. I read all the reviews & selected these to grind the small pills. The pestles are too small for any of the mortar sizes. The large pestle might work in the smallest mortar but even that combination did not power the small pills well enough or without effort. This product increased my work effort. Maybe it could be used for a child trying help in the kitchen."
1,Broken and no refund,I am a pharmacist and was very much looking forward to having a nice mortar and pestle to display. This arrived broken. I returned it in hopes of getting a refund and a replacement. Neither happened.
3,Mortar and Pestle,Bought Hic Porcelain Set of 3 Mortar and pestle as a gift for my daughter. She uses it as a decoration and is very happy with it.
3,too small for me but the other positive reviews are accurate,I give this only three stars although this is a nice product and the other reviewers who liked it better are describing the product accurately. These items seem to be too small for me. I am fearful of breaking them but I can't get anything really ground up or mashed up. I think it does work but that it is not my style. Probably most of the things I want to smash up are much harder than dog pills e.g. star anise.
4,Great set!,"For the price of only one inferior version, you get three high quality mortar/pestles- and as others have said, they work extremely well (the interior finish is perfect for most grinding jobs we do in our kitchen) and are easy to keep clean. They have also been very durable- although we've dropped the largest several times, no breaks/cracks, etc.. An extremely good value.My only negative comment is that the pestle on the smallest set is extremely small for my size XL hands- I have trouble holding it in a position that allows me to use it comfortably."
5,Perfect Spy...Perfect Book,"A Spy of Perfection in my graspthe intrigue and enigma make me gasp.The ending thrills, then makes me sayhurray for the master, John LeCarre."
2,Very disappointing...not LeCarre's best work,"If this is the first John LeCarre book you read, fine. Unfortunately, I read the Karla trilogy first, and this book goes downhill from that great experience. The book is too long, plots, sub-plots and anything else just goes from one thought and page to the next. There are times when I wasn't sure who was speaking: Rick, Magnus or Tom. I gave up on this halfway through, and probably won't finish it. Here is a suggestion to the author: Why not have one dynamic Smiley novel with all of the remaining characters (Guillam, Esterhas, Control) in one grand espionage masterpiece? This was the only LeCarre novel I did not enjoy. Sorry."
4,The Sins of the Father,"I have read A Perfect Spy three times over the years. Each time I have read it more slowly than the last. It is that kind of book. In fact the first few chapters (which seem to garner the most complaints) seem purposely dense, just to slow the reader down. The writing is thick with shifting tense, ambguity, dead-end content, and a cast of bit players who do not all contribute to the larger story. Le Carre owes as much to Dickens as he does to his own life experiences.For the determined and patient reader this is as good as the genre gets, but it rises above the genre as a character study of a man who has taken a lifetime to find himself. The lead character, Magnus Pym, who is not entirely a protagonist, spends all of his childhood and most of his adulthood trying on different versions of himself, modeled after his miscreant father Rick, Rick's ever-changing retinue of hangers-on, and countless other influences. It is a fascinating journey for Pym and for us."
3,Cat Book,"I guess I did not understand when I read a description of this book that it would be just what it is labeled. . . an instruction manual. I've never enjoyed reading instruction manuals and this one on cats is no exception. Although loaded with lots of valuable information, it just seems rather dull-- written in the form of a manual. Some may enjoy. . . .I would not purchase again."
2,Misleading,My son was going between this boot and the same boot with the side zipper for $10 less. We decided on this one only to receive it and it has a side zipper although it doesn't state it. I can see absolutely no difference between this boot and the less expensive one. When I called he couldn't give me a good explanation why. My son does like the boot alot even with the zipper but I feel like I was misled and the customer service person I talked to was less than helpful so with that in mind I will not buy from them again.
2,Not What I Hoped,"While I respect the idea of human spirit rising over adversity, I did not find that this book touched me in a way that similiarly themed stories did. Though the book reads easily, I found it to be rather forced at times and somewhat choppy in the story telling. I also found that the authors spent more time celebrating the way THEY overcame the adversity rather than their daughter. Additionally, I did not deeply feel the pain and the anguish that made the rising spirit all the more meaningful. It is an interesting account of the ways in which CF is now being treated and the ways in which everyday people can contribute to the fight. However, if you found this book interesting or want to learn more about the impact of this devestating illness, I beg you to read Frank Deford's ""Alex:The Life of A Child"". I find that once you've been touched by the spirit of Alex Deford, much else will pale in comparision."
5,Cabaret at it's best.,"A magnificent voice-and La Akers is at her very best when she sings in French.Fans of the female voice-and of something sophisticated, urbane and adult-will love this"
3,A bit spotty,"Don't get me wrong, I love the Om Lounge compilations, but I don't think that #2 was the best they could do. The songs are all in the same genre (just as every other om lounge compilation) and some are absolutely gorgeous, while others are just a cacophony of noise with irritating little bleeps and bloops stuck in. It's good background music, but not something I'd consciously listen to again."
4,Healthy diet,The idea with flax is not exactly new. Still important and worth considering. Good book.
5,Excellent!,"The book came quickly as ordered. This book has been a tremendous help to me and others I have recommended it to. It gives the basics as to how Flax oil can really help against cancer and other diseases. It is a bit old, but I have verified what she says by reading other literature. It is a bit of a challenge for a non-biologist to wade through, but well worth the trip."
5,Dawson's Creek Student Planner,"For all Dawson's Creek fans, this is a must have planner. Not only does the planner have about 40 pictures of the stars of the show (James Van Der Beek, Katie Holmes, Joshua Jackson, Michelle Williams, Kerr Smith and Meredith Monroe) but it includes very useful things that you would need in any good assignment book. Some of those things would be a full-year calender, class schedules for you to fill out for all 4 quarters of school, space for each individual day and it's assignments and plans, a grade keeper, useful websites, a section of weights and meausures, a table of conversations, commonly misspelled words, addresses and phone numbers, and more. So not only is this a great tool for acedemic and orginazational reasons, but the theme of it is Dawson's Creek, a great television series!"
1,Wish i never wasted my hard earned money!,"I brought three of these. one hardly worked straight out the box. only one remote doesnt work. two of the three dvd players just stop working. one minute u are watching a dvd and when you take it out to change it the next disc or the same one for that matter comes up ""bad disc"" i have only had them for about two and a half months. I am so disappointed. so now i will have to buy a new dvd player. It is really sad that they were only made in may of 2007."
1,Pray nothing bad happens to your stroller..,"because the customer service is non-existent. For this price point, buy nearly anything else. Company motto should be ""sucks to be you."""
3,Chucky's back!,"Just bought this CD, and I must say I'm impressed with Mr. Negron's vocal range throughout this CD. Not only does he cover some of the old Three Dog Night stuff, but he includes new originals as well, and he does it with a flair and style all his own! I also think including his children in some tracks is a nice, personal touch, which adds a unique, robust flavor here. The only song I don't care for is the 'discofied' version of ""Joy To The World."" I commend Chuck on getting his message across and for sharing his personal story with us. This is a must-have CD for all hardcore TDN fans and for those facing personal issues in their life. I highly recommend reading the book ""Three Dog Nightmare"", which is an accompaniment to the CD. Good work, Chuck!"
3,TAROT,INSTRUCTION BOOKLET TYPE WAS TOO SMALL SMALL SMALL GRAPHICSWERE JUST OK. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF IT HAD COMEWITH A SMALL BOO
5,Great Native American Deck!,"A few years ago I got into the Native American Spirituality and started mixing it with my Wiccan beliefs. I started looking for tarot or divination decks that were Native American. I found several I disliked, but this was one I was glad I bought. So far the cards have been very useful and all the readings have been correct. This isn't a traditional deck in any means. The suits have been completely changed as well as the symbolism of the pictures on the cards. It does come with a mini book that is very useful for learning the cards. These cards also don't need to be done with reversed or upside down cards. In fact I wouldn't know how to read a reversed card with this deck. lol. All in all though this is one of my top favorite decks out of all the decks I own....and I own over 15 divination decks."
2,DIRTY playing!,"I liked this movie... until I really learned how to drum.The playing isn't clean, the focus is not on drumline but on snare line (ok, ok, I play tenors so I'm biased), and there is virtually no story. If you are impressed by this, go watch some DCI and WGI videos so you can see that this movie is laughable. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because it at least HAS drums in it and it beats watching other really, really boring movies; also, I am ashamed to admit that I was entertained by it for a little while, until I learned more. But don't try to watch this specifically to learn how to drum/march/be in band... go get a pad and sticks and a decent teacher and some DCI/WGI vids."
1,Nice idea - poor finish,"I think most of the gushing reviewers here are in love with the ""concept"" of this film. I love southern colleges and the halftime experience too, but this movie is poorly made. Too cliche, too predictable, and overall just a simple product. However, until a good movie is made regarding this topic; line up and join the masses that seem to be ""falling over themselves"" about this movie based on the idea of the story."
4,Deum Demonstration,A good story wrapped in a lot of great drumming routines/shows. I also use the disk to demonstrate the capabilities of my Yamaha Sound Bar.
2,Very Well-Written Teen Movie with one glaring problem,"DRUMLINE is one of the few teen movies made in the past few years that seems to actually have some intelligence behind it's writing. It doesn't rely on stupid humor or obscenity. Not that I have anything against either of those, I just don't like it when that's all a movie has going for it. The characters here are all realistic; the plot's a pretty good one; the acting's pretty decent. BUT, and this is what earns only a two star rating, the main character is THE most unlikeable 'hero' I've ever seen in a movie. He really is a huge jerk, and the characters I thought were right end up 'seeing the light' and agreeing with the hero in the end. He really did not deserve a spot on the drumline, and I was glad when he got kicked off.But, really, I'm arguing semantics over a teen flick. If ya like it, I can't stop ya, you know. It's just not a movie for me. I'll just keep watching the old John Hughes movies."
1,This movie is unrealistic,"This movie is unrealistic and dumb. I am in marching band at Aliso Niguel HS and play trumpet. Drumline never has that many people in it and they never have their own little shows. I dont care if it takes place in a college they never do that. In conclusion tyhis is unrealistic and very bad. The military drum majors are whqat really kills the film. The drum Majors dont even play drums, they play baritone. This movie sucks do not buy it"
2,Don't even think about trying to be cool.,Don't even think about making band look as cool as playing football. An extended music video with very awkward performances. The music-video pieces have a few scenes worth watching but overall they should have spent a few more months on writing the story.
5,Marching Band,"If you have ever been in a black marching band . . . better yet, if you have ever went to a black high school or college where the kids went to the game, not to see the game, but to watch the band at half time, then you need to rent this DVD. It is tight! It reminded me so much of the life I used to know in the band: challenge, initiation, seniors going crazy with their power-tripping, the difference between chorus style marching (white bands) and military style marching (black bands)! It's all there. There are two more pluses. (1) There's a nice little romance going on. (2) J. Anthony Brown from the Tom Joyner Radio show is in the movie as the band director from the ""bad"" rival band and HE IS A TRIIIPPP!!! He is funny as hell and he reminds me of real band directors who used to shake their booties at the other band when they direct. This is a tight DVD!!! Buy it today. It is so real."
5,"Very sexy,romantic!","loved ""el viento""very relaxing and sensous...back to 5 was very uplifting...all in all great job!"
4,THIS is the Anne Carson Book to Read,"Forget about all that Autobiography stuff, and definitely try to forget all the recent stuff this chick's been writing. Anne Carson is at her best in the first section of this book, ""The Glass Essay."""
5,One of a kind!,"Most sufi books are either written by sufi sheikhs with a very symbolical discourse and thus, difficult to penetrate, or are written by academic researchers, who are not involved in sufi practices and therefore lack on mystical understanding. This book, however, is in a class of its own. By reporting his mystical journeys under ney-induced trance, the author gets his message through to that part of ourselves that understands without words, that can ""feel"" the message. My girlfriend even had a mystical experience while reading this book! I'm sure any sufi student will love it."
5,Immersion with basic conversational and vocabulary building,"Mastering Spanish from Penton Overseas isn't your usual language tape set: it's designed to offer destination-bound travelers quick keys to understanding, it includes a designer cd travel case for take-along toting on the trip, and includes U-print listening guides along with its 10 audio cds. Beginners will relish recordings by professional native speakers, a format which blends immersion with basic conversational and vocabulary building skills, and a format which lends to driving or walking. The Mastering Spanish set is recommended for travelers above others."
2,Big Disappointment,"Item was defective upon receipt. When plugged in, display lit up only a couple of numbers and only partially at that. I ordered this through Amazon Marketplace. The process to return the clock and/or receive credit was lengthy and complicated, but I did eventually get reimbursed. Note: This is an electric clock without a battery backup. That means every time there is a power interruption, you must remove the clock from the wall and reset all the numbers."
4,Fancy,"This item was a guess and it exceeded my expectations. Wonderful fun fragrance, not too strong. have received many compliments"
5,Good series,"Look,i can understand why people are upset with the releases.But seriously,you have no right to complain. Just wait for the whole season to be released, but if you want, this is a good deal."
4,Quick read - a MUST for anyone who still drinks milk!,"I was already aware of a lot of the information in this book, but it was useful - and really rather astounding - to have it all gathered in one small book. I would love to see all of America read this book, just to balance out the propaganda with which we are bombarded from the dairy industry's marketing and ""public service"" gurus. The only milk that ""does a [human] body good"" is human milk. Dr. Oski definitely makes that point in this book, in which he focuses on the adverse physical and emotional effects dairy products have on humans. Based on the varied research he cites, we should all be persuaded to stop drinking the milk of other species... and he doesn't even delve into the environmental or humanitarian aspects of the subject!"
4,"egg,eggs,eggs","Very easy to use and prepare eggs any way u like,hard,medium or soft.yum yum good good get your self one"
4,Easy to use,"I have hard boiled, pouched and soft boiled without a problem, no water leaked out and it performed as expected. The only issue is the adjustable timer, it only rings, but doesn't shut the unit off, so you have to pay attention."
2,Not worth it.,"While I was in my A&P; class, I thought this book would help with additional study. Not so much. The book is scattered around, and with what I was learning in class compared to the book, there was no match what so ever to study from.My advice. Stick with your text anatomy book and pay attention in class. This in no way helped me study or learn more.I give it two stars because the info is correct, but was not helpful for my intended purpose. Nor did I find it any 'simpler' than plain ol' paying attention in class."
5,funky good,"funky good sound of the classics iv. it makes you want to relive, your growing up years all over again. the sound is good for those dancing feet."
1,love monopoly if it would have worked.,I love playin the monopoly game.But unfortually the one i got will not work so i guess ill just stick to buying cd.s NO GAMES
3,gift,was ok and interesting but nothing special as given as a gift and hard to tell when ordering books if you do not know anything about them
2,Doesn't stand the test of time,"Although I can see why this game is such a classic, many of its elements simply don't stand the test of time. For example, I've heard people gush over the music, which I personally find underwhelming by today's high standards. Also the lack of direction can prove incredibly frustrating when you get lost. However, I should admit that I don't particularly enjoy non-linear sidescrollers, as I'm also not a fan of the 2D Metroid games."
5,Classic,"This is an awesome game and was worth getting it for my PS2 to have with my other Castlevania games. I just love the sound track and the graphics for it's time were very good. The only complaint I have is that when you die you don't get a continue and you have to wait through a death screen and then have to go through reloading your file all over again. Other than that this game is a classic, one of the best Castlevania games."
5,"Castlevania, GREAT OR WHAT!","Allldrool, ahggg, this game is sweeeeeeeeeeeet! 2D Graphics may not thrill, but it's a thrill ride in itself, it's different and exciting each time I play it. This game is one of the best games ever made, and it deserves to be at the top of the list, near Final Fantasy 7!--Patrick Browning--Game Dude"
4,The Best in the Series,"The game turned me on to the Castlevania series. You think you're done when you beat the game, but you are NOT. It will take a hundred hours to unlock the game to its core: finding all of the hidden items, extra characters, secret passages, and familiar helpers. My only complaint is that once your character collected a certain couple of hidden items, the boss of the game (the real one) seemed too easy.However, don't let this deter you from one of the most visually stunning 2D platformers ever. Music is elegant and haunting, and a myriad of monsters and bosses roam the absolutely gigantic castle. An excellant buy!"
4,Almost...,Compared to the first it falls short. Both beats & lyrics were great just not superb like their first. The beats varied which in some cases help an album but in this it didn't. Check it out!
3,Peel yer Bananimals sez Tenacious D's Nuts!,"Hmm. Crazy Folk Music that doen't so much flirt with controversy as it repeatedly sodomizes it. Sounds familiar and I don't mean the often incoherent lyrics. The album comes dangerously close to attaining dark brilliance at times but suffers from lack of clarity at times and other times excessive focus. Just listen to the sample of 'Love Me or Die,Bitch' for an example. It starts off so well but it putters out in just seconds, perhaps when the singer went off his Fool Fuel.Had he poured on more angst and more booze, it could have been classic. For folk music with an edge, stick to Tenacious D or another of the Frogs albums which you can sample right here on Amazon.com. Love it or Die? Then I guess I'm a dead man."
2,Not one of Travis's better CDs.,"Disappointd in this CD. Was hoping for a great CD. This is not. Rather lame. Not up to Travis's usual stuff. Like all of his music. Have all of his CDs. To me, the best job he does on this CD is, ""Tougher Than The Rest""."
1,Pusilanimous Excreta from a Hillbilly Madman.,"This miserable offering from unconvincing transexual Travis Tritt is truly a convincing argument for the nuclear obliteration of Branson, MO. Now. If Travis Tritt has a razor, I don't think the beard is the first thing he should cut. (hint...wrists, Trav! Good boy!) A regrettable offering, and a final nail in the mouldering coffin of authentic Country and Western music."
5,One of the Best Christmas albums,"The songs on this album evoke such strong (and pleasant) emotions from me. Some are hauntingly beautiful, and others just upbeat and inspiring. If I could only own 5 Christmas albums, this album would make the cut. It's not ""really"" Christmas until I've listened to this incredible album."
2,If it weren't for...,"The stars are for Kay Thompson, she has a beautiful voice, an obvious gift. If not for this album I wouldn't have known about her. As for M.W. Smith for over a decade now I can't get over the fact that his voice resembles Looney Toon's Elmer Fudd - it is comical. It's hard to dismiss the similarity."
2,This was not necessary.,"I understand the significance of this performance (the late Bernard Edwards' finale), however, this recording is average at best. First, we could have done WITHOUT Sister Sledge, Slash, and the Rapper's Delight rendition. They detracted from Chic's mystique. The CD loses its focus and seems to just 'ramble'. I was incredibly disappointed with this entire release. If you want Chic, get one of their ""Best Of"" CD's and you'll go home happier."
3,for proffessionals,"Great book but aimed more at therapists than parents. There is a good chapter on parenting. I did think it was worthwhile though reading about the type of therapy these kids need, especially since mine is about to start therapy."
4,Snuggly Rattler,"What a cute stuffed rattle snake! It bends all around so you can pose him in many positions. He can hang from a bookshelf or sit by on a table. Personally, the rattler is my favorite type of snake and this one is very neat."
5,Made for walkin'....,"perfect fit for a 6.5 feet, actually, this shade of brown is just so delish! The leather is soft yet firm. I loved this so much, I got another one in red!"
2,Not my cup of tea,"Hot dude but not a very good workout, I like a bit more variety. I tried the video and tried it again but will probably not pull it out again."
2,like fruitcake,"A lot of information packed into a book. Too much to just sit and read. Like trying to sit down and eat a fruitcake in one sitting with nothing to drink. As a long term reference, might be nice, if you can take it a bit at time. Appears accurate, but not my first choice."
2,Wipeout,"I agree with the other people, this game is fun. But......for some reason i can't save it. if i do, it erases all my other saved data on my memory card. i suggest you rent it first, then buy it."
5,"wonderful, entertaining upbeat book","A great upbeat memoir by the man who gave us great shows, such as Mame, Hello Dolly and the wonderful Mac and Mabel. This book is a classic, like the musicals. He is so full of life and a genuine fondness for both people and theater. I liked his stress on his lyrics, which are what he does best. Our best lyricist- composer of oldfashioned musicals and show tunes. I couldn't put the book down. I hope Jerry Herman writes some more musicals. I also hope he writes another book"
2,Not what i was expecting!,"I wanted this DVD to relive fights that I enjoyed from 2011 as well as to see fights I had not yet seen. Amongst putting in the DVD I was pumped to watch these fights.First fight was JDS vs. Velasquez, but was highly disappointed to find out the rest of the fights were not full fights, but mere highlights of the best parts of the fights...Don't expect to watch the full fights that you paid for because that's not what you will get. This irritates me to no end. I feel like I got ripped off, I bought the DVD, I just want to watch the full fights!! I almost feel like I want to go find a rip off copy of these fights, why? Because I already paid for them.. and I didn't get them. Call me an angry customer."
3,It's Ok - Much less content than previous releases,"I love MMA, I love UFC, I love watching good UFC fightsI just wish this dvd had more of them.The dvd seems very commercial. The first dvd is, in essence, an advertizement for upcoming fights.You get 6 full fights with this release.I thought other reviewers were overreacting but there is a significant lack of content here."
2,Lame,"This is the worst best of yet. Fights are great, however, they are not complete fights! I pre-ordered this based on how good the best of series is, I will never buy another one!"
1,Disappointing...,"How could the UFC put this out without specifically saying it is just highlights of these fights. Disgraceful, I want my money back"
5,grade A-,"Grade: A-This is the type of stuff people should be thinking of when they throw around the term ""post-hardcore"". This sh*t is sharp music and it has an aggressive edge. I like pop music as much as the next person, but sometimes it's good to get rough without jumpin' in the pit, and this is the band to do it to. There's some really cool moments where the songs jump back and forth between being lead by the bass and drums, then back to the guitars, going quiet, then blowing up in your face. A few times i caught myself thinking ""wait, did they just do that?"" and it turns out they certainly did. Haymarket Riot is the type of band i wish was local so i could see them whenever i wanted, and so i could say ""i remember them when..."". as for now, i'm gonna have to look into some back catalog searching, because i've got some catching up to do. Oh yeah, i can't forget to mention the shredder layout.Listen To This While: Listening to it. really. (BGW)"
5,Awesome DVD and CD,"""Spirit"" by Peter Buffet is a spiritual expirience that you will never forget. Originally a stage show, it was brought to film and now has captured a NAMMT Award for best ""Native Heart "" at the Native American Music Awards this past Saturday. The music takes you on a journey visually and musically exploring what happens when technology takes over our lives and parallels the Native American simple way of living simultaneously through various image, music, and dance. All mediums of music are used, Native American,jazz, blues, PowWow, New Age,and ballet dance,erc. Your emotions will be all over the map, you laugh, cry, experience joy. The spiritual journey is worth every bit of the price of the DVD and I bought the CD as well so I could listen to the music only over and over. 5 star album fabulous!"
1,Unenjoyable,"Although the story was interesting, I found the book to be very unchallenging and the authors writing style to be adolescent."
4,I liked MOST of it.,"Many of the song I took a liking too, but there were some I thought were just boring. No matter what Andrea sings, he will sound great, but that doesn't mean the song will be good. The fifth song on the album entitled ""A Volte Il Cuore"" sounds cheesy. On the other hand, the fourth song called ""O Mare E TU"" is oustanding and very sensual. Andrea has great dynamics. If at first you do not appreciate the song at face value, read the English translation. ""Tremo E T'Amo,"" meaning ""I love you and I'm trembling"" is about a soldier who fights in a war and dies. Very touching."
3,"What do you mean, Sogno?","Tell me, what brought up this title? Maybe it's the idea of songs that tell of la-la lands? Or maybe it's just the tradition of romantic melodical experiences in Europe. Either way, that's the way Andrea is on this follow-up to ""Romanza.""I suspect that because ""Sogno"" was numerically more popular than its predecessor (it sold over ten million copies here!), it's ""much better"" due to this second-time-around thing wherein someone releases an album, it sells, and its sequel is what I just said: better than the first. In THIS case, however, I don't think so. But ""The Prayer"" left me in uncontrollable tears. Ditto ""Cantico,"" the ""Canto Della Terra"" (my favorite Andrea Bocelli song so far!) and ""Mai Più Così Lontano."" But not for the likes of ""O Mare e Tu"" or ""I Love Rossini.""Since I love Andrea, I don't know...I might get this album again, but his next non-classical album seems like light years away from today. Anyway, Sogno, schmogno! Romanza Rules!"
2,"Starts out okay, but gets boring quickly.","The album starts out nicely enough, but after a few songs they all start running into each other and sound the same. Totally boring. I was disappointed. I will go back to his ""Arias"" album. Real Opera!"
2,Only a couple of goodies...,"First of all, Mr. Bocelli has a very good tenor voice. I wouldn't compare him to God like some have, but it's very nice. The only songs I cared for on this album were ""The Prayer"" and ""Sogno."" But even they aren't timeless classics. I think Celine Dion ruins the song with her accent on the English and the Itallian. She was just a marketing ploy to get people to buy the song. He should have been paired with a better singer on it. ""Sogno"" was pretty in places, but nothing I'd write home about. The rest of the CD was just boring, poorly written songs that will be forgotten in one year, tops."
5,FANTASTIC!,"As my first introduction to Bocelli, I have enjoyed this CD thoroughly! I would highly recommend this CD as a great gift, even to those who are not fans of opera. As a fan of Pavarotti's voice, I find a lot to like. I have also picked up ROMANZA which is also good... but if I had to choose, SOGNO takes first place."
1,Andrea Bocelli...not for me!,"If you noticed, my sister Ana Rivera wrote a review earlier.I don't think the the album was worth 3 stars.I think it would have been a little better if it were in english.Personaly, I don't like opera because it's not in english.My sister is obsessed with him. Even if she didn't give him a good review I still have to listen to him sing on the album. That is the only reason I wrote this review. I don't know if this will help anybody, but I just wrote what I thought about the album. Thank you.p.s No offense to Andrea."
1,The music had no continuity,"I think this CD was very poor and would not recommed it to anyone. The music did not flow well and had no continuity. Basically, only people with horrible taste in music would enjoy this CD."
3,Sogno is a dream,"A beautful offering by one of the world's most talented vocalists. Although the songs are not as catchy as those on Romanza or Villagio Italiano, this CD is one for the masses.It takes a rare talent in today's fragmented music world to make a recording that can be appreciated by everyone. Bocelli has that talent"
5,This Dream I want to keep having.,"While I truly enjoyed his duets, I particularly enjoyed ""Come Un Fiume Tu."" A beautiful song. And a then ""A Mio Padre,"" a truly tender tribute to his father. Bravo. Every musician has their own unique style that we are either drawn to or not. It's why there are so many types of music in the world to enjoy. I enjoy this. Those who don't, I invite them to enjoy their music and allow us the right to enjoy Senor Bocelli's music, unencumbered by uneducated criticism."
3,"Overpowering at times, but not bad, for what it is","Yesterday I ordered the Asian 2-CD release of this album. My purpose for this was just plain simple: I desperately just couldn't do without seeing more MTV-like music videos by the man I call my favorite singer, because I just couldn't find any music videos by him on the Web, other than his duet with Sarah Brightman being Time To Say Goodbye. Even though the album itself gets pretty overpowering at times, I can't give it anything less than three stars because: 1. it's a pop album by Bocelli, and 2. it's Andrea Bocelli. Several spectacular moments highlight the project, anyway, the best of which go straight to the Canto Della Terra, The Prayer (despite the fact that it's not one of my favorites), O Mare e Tu (considering some of you like it), and ""Mai Più Così Lontano."" To be honest, though, some of the songs are a bit too powerful for me to deal with."
4,Some of the opening songs are very emotional,"The first three songs of this album are very emotional, very appealing. However, the later songs on this CD somehow do not measure up to the level of these first three.I agree with one of the previous writers, Sogno would sound more beautiful if Pavarotti had sung it. That being said, however, Bocelli has a very dedicated team working with him to come up with imaginative and appealing materials to work with. I just cannot imagine Pavarotti coming up with the same kind of pop materials, though the songs would sound incredible with his voice."
4,"Bocelli's magical, soaring voice, clear diction are perfect!","His voice is one in a million. He doesn't need to improvise vocally to express powerful emotions. With a few exceptions, the song selection is excellent. The best and most powerful is ""Tremo e T'amo."" Other terrific tracks include ""Cantico,"" ""Sogno,"" and ""Come un Fiume Tu."" Some of the melodies seem incomplete and almost leave you thirsting for more, however, and become agitating when they don't climax when you would like them to...but when they do climax, the feeling is purely electric: you might not be able to stop shivering from the chills that will run down your spine."
5,Breath-taking,Andrea portrays his emotions so well in this album. It practically leaves you speechless. The flowing and rythmatic style is wonderful. Buy it today!!!
5,Mr.Bocelli voice is so rich it is fattening!!,"Anything Mr. Bocelli sings is done with so much meaning, especially The Prayer. His voice is like rich dark chocolate wrapped in carmel!"
3,"not much more than ""absolution""","""absolution"" is the only highlight on this cd.after this song, not really much else is worth your attention."
4,These are awesome,"I use these to make customized labels or jars or storage boxes, and when my kids are lucky we use them for special art projects. We can make special stickers for my boys that combine their names and interests--very customized to them, which is a real treat for them. They can also be used for special, unique gift tags, which really put that special ""something"" onto a gift."
5,I love this project paper!,"The possibilities here are limited only by your imagination. I am currently using these to make cute stickers for my homemade jams, jellies, vinegars, and limoncello to give as Christmas gifts. I can just print them up and cut them out at will, as many as I need, and it's very easy to peel and stick - and if it's not just right the first time, you can reposition them too! Well thought out product, THANKS Avery, you've done it again."
3,Not good for glass stenciling with small cuts,"I tried to use it for sand blasting on glass. I needed to be able to cut tiny pieces and to be able to reuse the stencil. IT didn't work for that project. The design was very tiny pieces and I think for larger stickers it would work, but as a stencil, I would recommend a thinner paper like Avery Clear Full-Sheet Labels for Inkjet Printers, 8.5 x 11-Inches, Pack of 10 (18665"
5,Mrs. Miracle,The DVD came packaged well. The DVD is good quality and plays well. Like having the information about the DVD available inside the case.
2,Mrs Miracle,Mrs Miracle I am still waiting for this item to arrive so at the moment I cannot really submit a proper review
4,Good holiday movie!,"I loved the book, so I had to see the movie version. It is a sweet holiday movie that will become a Christmas tradition for my family."
3,Not sewn together well,Had it less than a year and It's a nice product but it is coming apart at the seams where it is sewn together.
4,Could be bigger,Great Little bag for the XBOX 360. The only complaint is that it could have a little more storage but it's adequate.
5,The best travel case.,"This is a amazing travel case for XBOX 360. I thought it would not fit all because I use the XBOX360 intercooler, but everything fits perfectly:1 XBOX360 with intercooler.2 game controls1 HDMI cable + 1 Audio/Video normal cable1 Power Supply with cableA lot of games."
5,Make your 360 portable!,"Some of the reviews I have read for this are a little hastey. Claims of not fitting everything needed ? Unfounded! With a little creativity, you can fit everything you need. This is the best carry case for a system I have found yet. The packaging claims to hold 2 controllers. Do they really thing you would haul around your 360 with just 2 controllers ? I was, with some shuffling around, able to get 4 controller along with the 360 itself, the A/V cables, power supply, power cable, games and a memory unit. And I am willing to bet I could get a charger for the controllers batteries in there too!!! HIGHLY recommend this brand carry case. They also put a case out for the Wii and PS3. Should I choose to cart those around, this will be the brand a choice. And for the price, it's a no brainer."
4,The Old Curiosity Shop + Voyage of the Unicorn,"I found The Old Curiosity Shop by Charles Dickens well acted, and I enjoyed the story; I didn't care for the ending however. It is rather long, so it is a good movie for a rainy afternoon.As I enjoy fantasies, I also enjoyed the Voyage of the Unicorn. It wasn't overly violent, had no bad language, and was sprinkled with humor. A father and his two daughters thrown into a fantasy world while trying to put their lives back together after the death of his wife and their mother."
4,Excellent entertainment,"I never thought I would enjoy this story as I did when I watched this version of the movie... I had never read the book in its entirety, but I did know the story - having been brought up reading Dickens and Shakespeare at school. I never thought I would enjoy Mr. Quilp, but I did, and I wish I could shake Tom Courtenay's hand - I thoroughly enjoyed Quilp - he was the best of all!! I felt sorry for him in the end. Kit was a delight. The scenery was beautiful, the sets excellently put together..I can't impose on people that the size of the book should not alarm them, as originally these were written in weekly sections. I do think we should all read at least one of Charles Dickens' books (apart from A Christmas Carol) and get the feeling of Victorian England and its effect on children especially, as Mr. Dickens so keenly addresses and describes.."
5,Wonderful!,"This was a very good depiction of the old days. While we're not familiar with Dicken's book ""The Old Curiosity Shop"", we arethoroughly pleased with this version. The acting, the characters, the scenery, seemed so authentic with the time period. Nell,for instance, just seemed to have that victorian appearance: with the small mouth, large eyes, very meek and quiet like. We donot know how it was done to make the streets of victorian London and vicinity look so life like and real, but it was done verynicely. There are a few scenes of fighting, but otherwise this production is good for the entire family. We thought it waswonderful! It makes us want to read the book!"
1,No thanks.,"I ususally tend to favor style and innovation over actuall vocal quality, but Everlast stretches that to the point of no hope. The rough gargle I hear coming out of this guy's throat is enough to drive me away from the album all by itself. The bland guitar playing and dull-witted lyrics don't help much either. House of Pain man or not, this dosen't cut it."
4,highly recommend,"I had this cd years ago,unfortunately it got lost.I ordered itrecently and it basically stays in my cd player in my car.anyone who liked Everlast in house of pain will love him on this cd. same great voice and talent only more mature.These songs are the type everyone can relate to and enjoy."
5,i like this album.....truth for a change,"this album is about how real life is and i like that because somepeople have become blind to things in life and take them for grantedand thats what this whole ablum is about and i suggest you buy this album""then you might really know what it's like"""
5,Great mixture of sounds!,"This album shows Everlast's true musical talent and in no way takes away from his hip hop roots. The CD has a little bit of everything, which is good. This is also a CD that anyone can relate to. Each song carries a different emotion with it. This CD is definetly a ""keeper!"""
2,What its like is out to fool you.,This CD would really be good if every song sounded like What its like. A little more folk/rock and a little less hip hop and they would go far.
4,Good album.........................Great album!,"This is a pretty good CD. I first heard ""What it's like"" on a stupid rock station here, but the song is the only reason I listen to the station. I heard some of the other more rappish tracks, that no radio station plays, and they are the most creative songs I've heard since the Beastie Boys."
2,what the hell is this?!,"I dont know what the hell this is.but i can tell u this much, it aint typical everlast. i mean this is the everlast from the house of pain! this is extremely different and not quite as appealing as one would think despite its unbelievable sales rank. now i aint hating everlast, but kinda like busta rhymes did when he wuz with leaders of the new school he kinda sold out.busta rhymes old styles wuz much more wild and different than it is now and whenever i hear that name i say to myself, this shit is purely commercial just like his previos solo albums. everlast wuz the hardest core no **** kik *** i mean bizness whiteboy rapper of his time!what happened?"
5,Whitey Ford Sings the Blues is the BEST album of 1998,"I have been a big fan of hip-hop and all its derivatives for over a decade and I can't remember a better overall album. Everlast's music has matured along with my taste. This album is everything I have been looking for since Sublime's work in the early to mid 90's. Everlast may not be Jimmy Hendrix on the guitar or sing like Luther Vandross but this album just works it is definitely a career effort. I won't be surprised if this album does very well (I'd say top 10 in billboard by Christmas). I played this album for most of my friends at URI and they love the album as much as I do. Most of my friends do not like rap, but fell in love with Evelast's album"
5,SWEET,"This is a sweet album, and everlast is amazing. This has good mixes of rock and rap and will leave you loving it. Buy this one NOW."
1,MISLEADING,"I, like most of you (probably) liked rap back in high school and fortunately grew out of that phase. House of Pain was one of my favorites and Everclear was the only white rapper with talent. He may still have some but does not show it in this album. When I first heard ""What it's like"" I thought that he may have changed his style for the better. And when I saw that he had named his album ""Whitey Ford Sings the Blues"" I was even more drawn for my love of good blues music. This album offers none of the above. Everclear just could'nt keep away from the popular rap stylings of modern day and dissapointed me to no end. Do not buy this album for ""What it's like"" nor the distasteful ""Ends"", they mislead the album for ""What it is""."
1,Outdated,"While this book might have represented the cutting-edge in 1997, it is seriously outdated today. For instance, the book talks about offshore trusts as the penultimate asset protection tool, which was of course disproved in the Anderson case in 1999 and the Lawrence case in 2000, where in both cases those who set up offshore trusts went to jail. This book is good for the archives, and not much else."
5,i love afs!!!,"i've been a fan of these guys for a while now and was waiting desperately for this album to come out, and they definately didn't dissapoint, i have to say that slip like space is one of my favorite songs of all time!"
4,No complaints,"I purchased this for my DVD/VCR converter combo. The product is working just fine. I haven't had an opportunity to use it a lot, but that's a good thing, right?"
1,Don't Buy This,"Don't buy this awful product. It made the VCR picture quality worse. I had to ""fix"" my VCRs with the Wet-Type VCR cleaner. I bought a Maxell Dry-Type VCR cleaner tape before from Amazon.com for about $6.99 for a single pack. It worked great. But, this economy-version dry-type cleaner is terrible. I thought I ruined my VCRs after using this product. Luckily I was able to fix this with a wet-type VCR cleaner I had stored at my home."
4,We use a wet one and a dry one... great line from a straight man to a comic...,"No. I wasn't referring toTJ Wisemen RCFM222 Remote Controlled Fart Machine No. 2I mean, some times a dry cleaner works better than a wet one. Often I'll do a dry one,then follow it up with a wet one likeMaxell VP-200 VHS Wet CleanerI wouldn't recommend a WET one followed by a DRY one... that might bind you all up orsomething. I hate it when my stuff gets all bound up and it requires being opened up bya professional.I hope I have layed/laid... PUT all the options ON the table. Buy these before they gothe way of... of.... VCRs!Thank you!"
1,Major Crappp !!!!!!!!!,This head cleaner damaged my VCR and did not WORK !!! Would not buy again !! My VCR now has a blurry picture that does not clear up nor goes away.
1,"Maxell vp100 dry head cleaner Once great,now garbage.","Once great, now garbage.This product used to be one of the best, possibly the best, dry head cleaners out there. It never failed to clean our vhs heads, usually with only one cycle and with no noticeable harm. It came in a blue box with a picture of two women on the front. The cleaner ran for around twenty seconds and featured an aquarium theme.Unfortunately, in the last year or so, Maxell has replaced this item with a head cleaner that shows nothing but static, must be run through several times, and then doesn't work anyway. My result was only product failure, but from reviews here, it seems that actual harm to the vcr is possible. If you are lucky enough to find an older blue box version of this cleaner, get it while you can. But stay away from the yellow box/birds on cover Maxlink edition."
3,EH,"Glad I bought the wet tape as well, I have to run the wet, wait a while then run the dry for either to work."
3,"Too Early For a Review, Amazon","I'm writing this review at the urging of Amazon.Com, but it's really a bit early. I bought a couple of Maxell VP100 Dry Video Head Cleaners because I planned to copy a lot of old VHS tapes to DVD on my new VCR/DVD recorder. I've successfully used it about five times total on three VCRs. In the last attempts, when I inserted the cartridge, it immediately started rewinding, and I had to stop it and hit play. It doesn't always play. This has happened on two VCRs. So...the jury's still out on this product. I think I'm supposed to get about 100 uses. I'll come back and edit my review if I have any new information."
1,BEWARE! THIS PRODUCT DOES-NOT-WORK!,"The only thing that I got out of this head cleaner was ""snow"" on the television screen! It is THE worst product that I have ever purchased online! Before submitting this rating, I attempted to return same, however, my reason (which was ""product is defective“) for wanting to return was not being accepted. Now I am stuck with this piece of junk! Wish there was a zero rating up here. Thanks Maxell."
3,"uh, where is the betamax head cleaners",What's the deal with this dvd thingamagig. It can't be better than tried and true vhs. There is nothing better than the whirring sound of your vhs machine while your tape gets stuck in the middle of a movie.
5,Fantastic Tapes,Speedy delivery and arrived in good condition. The first time I used the tape it did a terrific job of cleaning the heads. I was so upset thinking I would have to send my Sony DVD\VCR out for professional cleaning. I was advised by a Sony rep to use these tapes. I couldn't believe the difference in taping after I used the Maxell. I tried it on another VCR and after 2 cleanings it also worked well. I purchased 3 tapes - I don't want to worry for a while. Thank you for the great product.
5,"So far, so GREAT!","I've used this cleaner during a tedious dubbing from really old vhs to dvd. From a heavily coated oxygenated tape, I've been able to clean the heads while improving the visual of the vhs movie. I will purchase this item again, for sure."
3,I think it is OK,I have a panasonic tv with built in VCR. VCR doesn't work and tapes were getting stuck. I thought/hoped this would do the trick. It didn't help. I will try to use it on my other VCRs. Maybe they need some help before they go bad too.
3,Get the Wet Tape Cleaner,This is very convenient to use but the wet cleaner works better. Simple to use and can be used multiple times.
1,VCR had no change,"There was no change, either good or bad, after using this item. I ended up having to buy a new VCR."
4,Listen to Russian first...,"I saw T.A.T.U. on MTV and I thought they were very unique and interesting. I downloaded their song in English and Russian. The Russian versian was so much better. When I listened to it, I didn't know that the song was origionally in Russian, so I just assumed that it was pure luck that it ""translated"" so great. The English version is the same except that the lyrics are terrible. If you are very nit-picky abut lyrics, the Russian version is for you."
4,Great upgrade to a 5.1 system,"Bought two of these; I had front left, front right and center, and purchased these with a Polk subwoofer to complete a 5.1 set. Very happy with these as my satellites, they fulfill their role in a compact 5.1 setup very well."
4,Good story,I really liked how the story switched from the viewpoints of the four main characters. I will admit to shedding a few tears over the last few pages of the book
1,A Bollywood film masquerading as literature,"I read the reviews on Amazon before I read the book and tried to find at least pockets of either good storytelling and/or good writing. The book is as drab as can be, the characters are uni-dimensional and the writing is drab, and the story is dull.The only merit I found in the book was the interesting form of narration from different POVs.Otherwise it seems like anything will pass as long it is exotic (read different culture.)The book felt like watching a cliched Indian (Bollywood) film of the 70s or 80s. At least in a Bollywood film you expect certain formulaic things to happen. With a literary work I expect it to be, well, just different."
4,Worked well,"Among the several trays to use with car seats, this I decided was the best value. I bought it because we were taking a long car trip with my 4-year-old granddaughter. She accepted it well, but her mother didn't really like it, and removed it the minute it began to seem unnecessaray to whatever the child was doing. So it didn't really get to show its stuff.An advantage is that it goes on quickly and fastens fairly securely either behind or under the car seat or booster seat. My granddaughter was able to do some drawing and a bit of embroidery [!] [well, sort of], and enjoy her sticker books while using the tray."
5,Herbal Medicine,"Herbal Medicine is beautifully illustrated. I enjoyed the book very much. However, I didn't find all of the herbs that I was looking for. The book is a basic guide on herbs and what they are used for.I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in herbal medicine."
3,liked the pictures--not easy to read/use,There is alot of information about the herbs and what forms they are best used in. It was hard to figure out what they should or should not be used for and finding an herb you are looking for is nearly impossible without knowing specific names. The listings are under the scientific name making it hard for someone like me just starting to learn to find anything in the book.
3,Play Bob,"Bob's landmark album of low-key skits - Shelley Berman like phone calls and Robert Benchley style speeches -- is an interesting curio mainly in light of how successful it was. Even the audience reaction on the album is fairly subdued. Charming, but slight."
3,Good but avoid intense colors,"I've used the Avery film tee-shirt transfers to make iron-on logos and Christmas tees, and they've worked out well. I used one of the same designs when trying this iron-on fabric, and the color saturation just didn't measure up to the film iron-ons. Black came out grey, and bright red wasn't intense enough for holiday designs. Other than that, they printed well and ironed on nicely."
4,Works Well,"I thought this was a neat idea, and looked forward to trying it out. I was a little disappointed by the brightness of the printouts. I guess it's difficult to get really bright colors using a paper that is this porous. It is easy to use, cut and iron on. I wouldn't recommend using this on something that is going to be washed often, but it great for things like totes or hats or novelty items that won't be worn over and over again."
5,AGGRESSIVE MUSIC IN THE PUREST FORM,"this makes swans studio records sound like lullabyes, and considering they are not easily listening by any stretch of the imagination, i'd say get this only if your not worried about your eardrums being damaged. a masterpiece of pure industrial power that captures swans at the peak of their harshest period."
5,Superb Quality Prevail Premium Washcloths,I'm very happy with the quality of these wipes and extremely pleased with the way they neutralize body odors. Great of people who are disabled as well as those who just need a quick clean up. I will continue to purchase this product
3,Parsifal....maybe !,"I decided to purchase this DVD because I was NOT familiar with Wagner's operas.Another reviewer mentioned there is not one single aria that stood out...how true! There may be brilliant moments here and there in this opera ...but otherwise for ME, the music just wanders on and on.I am not qualified to comment on the performances of the singers - but in my opinion, they all did their best, and they all have WONDERFUL voices. It was the opera, not the singers that I personally have difficulty with.I have made the decision that Verdi, Puccini, and Rossini operas are much better operas for ME, as I just prefer the style.I received a great suggestion from Esteban:If you are not familiar with Wagner operas, perhaps it might be best to start with one of his earlier operas such as Lohengrin. And as you become more familiar with Wagner's style, you can always work up to his later operas. What a great and very Logical suggestion !!"
5,Jurassic 5 = The Truth,"From the first to the last track, there is no doubt in saying that Jurassic 5 is the truth. This is the second major label release from J5 and they just keep raising the bar. Although 'Power in Numbers' is a departure from 'Quality Control' and the EP, the unique J5 flavor is still present. While 'Quality Control' was good, I truly believe that 'Power in Numbers' is light years better; it encompasses so much more and sounds more polished. I can't take this cd out the player--it's that good! It's definately worth the fourteen dollars PLUS SHIPPING! In fact, get two...give the other one to someone in need of hearing something fresh."
2,pire skill,the jurassic 5 should be and are in my book ledgens.This album is the best i heard so far.
4,J5 Power In Numbers,"Yo J5's Defanitly Got A Hot Album Here. They Got A Hot SingleOff It Called ""Whats Golden"". Its Getin Mad Air Play On Tha Radio And Mtv (and mtv2). Its A Dope CD And I Hope J5 Keeps Up Tha Good Work1ne"
5,J5 does it again,"After their release of Power in Numbers, I'm wondering if J5's albums can get any better. I didn't think that they would top Quality Control, but I thought wrong. The mix of old-school beats with new hip-hop and their own style is the perfect blend if you are a hip-hop/rap fan. These six guys must be some of the most talented MC's around."
4,Cape Town Lounge,"A nice compilation of new age, instrumental jazz. Wide range of artists. Recommended for those fans of this genre."
1,Dissapointing and Poorly organised,"If you are looking for a book that tells you where to get bargains then you will be sorely dissapointed. The book is devoted solely to those with plenty of money looking for designer labels and ""exclusive"" shops. For instance, no mention of the clothing district around Rue Claire with hundreds of shops selling lower priice clothing - but endless pages devoted to Chanel, J-P Gaultier etc.The book is organised according to the various arrondisments (districts) in Paris. Would have been more useful if organise according to the various items you might be interested to buy - shoes+clothing, perfume, food etc."
1,Limited and hard to use,"This book is difficult to use and very limited in scope. It is organized by the right and left bank which is so broad as to be of little use. Occassionally, it will mention a street and rattle off the names of some stores on that street. Fewer adjectives and more hard information would have helped. A large amount of space is given to big name stores and famous designers that nobody needs a special guide to find. It mentions Limoges twice but gives no further information about where one can find Limoges. It didn't mention Gien, a famous French pottery which is now sold in Neiman Marcus. Other guides were much more useful than this book in helping locate clothing stores that would appeal to a teenage girl. The shopping information in the typical guide book was more useful and eaiser to access."
3,"Great Song, but......","This is probably the best song on the Encore album, it is socially-engaged and lyrically brilliant. The beat might feel a bit unoriginal since the people in the Shady Camp have exploited the ""soldier"" theme a bit excessively (both musically and in lyrical content). Nonetheless, if there are 3 songs on Encore worth you time, this is surely one of them.On the other hand, all Eminem singles are a waste of money in the sense that they have nothing to back the main song, no remix, no b-side, nothing of interest. As you can plainly see in this case, you get Just Lose It as a B-side, which is hilarious since Just Lose It was the first single on its own. Eminem has a number of recent ureleased songs which circulate the net in low quality, he definitely should consider putting them on future singles or else they will remain so blatantly unattractive to buy."
1,The beat is good..not the lyrics,"This song is not the worst with a good beat which is probably the only good element of the song, it is like a drum beat for this song.The lyrics ain't tight or interesting he just asks for peace and then attacks Ja and Murder inc. (lyrically).I don't know what happened to his lyrics, he used to be a tight rapper with funny lyrics but know he just raps with his boy 50 (who sucks) and all those.The chorus is just wack and has an annoying voice to it. Also the video is gay and instead of this you should buy some quality rap like rakim, canibus, Talib kweli which has better lyrics and is better.N Thats all I have 2 say about that SHIT"
1,Something is wrong here.,"In looking at the dimensions of your inflatable baby tub, it states that this tub is 2.75 inches x 9.38 inches x 8.88 inches. This is ridiculous. I couldn't even fit my toy poodle into something like that. It sounds like you are describing a pan. I was interested in purchasing this, but certainly not going to take a chance based on erroneous dimensions like that."
3,ok... just not to my taste...,"I have tried other versions of newtons/bars from Barbara's as well as Newman's... while none are as good as the originals from Nabisco, the other brands I have tried are superior in flavour and closer to the originals. These seem to be too dry for my taste, but I am sure that they are more healthy. Since I am a stickler for the flavour of my food matching my expectation, I doubt I will order these again."
5,Definately Tight,Q-Tip and Saadiq are definately ballin with this single......... unfortunately a very hard CD to find.
3,Beautiful music.,"I love the sound of the pipa, beautiful music. Though each track sounds like the one before."
3,Not the best of the three,"This movie is one hour and eighteen minutes and released on April 26, 1956. Ricou Browning, who playe the Creature in the water, is the only one to be in all three Creature movie. Another piece of trivia is Rex Reason and Jeff Morrow were in the movie This Island Earth. The first two Creature movies were great to watch. As for this one, let just say they did not listen to some true advice: if it is not broke, don't fix it. The story is lame and gone is the great underwater scenes. Also they made the Creature a land animal and made him put on weight. Only buy if you want the trilogy."
3,Should have quit while they were ahead,This movie really dosn't offer anything new.Scientist track the creature down in the everglades and in the battle the horriably burn the creature requiring emergency surgery to save his life The result a much different looking and docile creature who can breathe air. The creature who then stands around in a pen with some sheep lookinng at a nearby pond. While the man who finanacied the expeditition fights with his wife. and in a jealous rage kills the man whom he thinks his wife is sleeping withand tries to blame the creature who escapes and kills him.
3,A standard beginner string,I used these as a beginning string student and now my daughter uses them on her violin as a beginning student. They are metal core and don't produce the clearest sound but they do the job for the beginner.
4,"Comfortable, stable shoe","I have purchased several pairs of this shoe and continue to be very satisfied. It is an extremely comfortable shoe from day one and has good stability. In addition, it is quite durable and the heel does not wear down quckly like other shoes I have worn in the past. I run 5-12 miles a day and have been very satisfied with these. I also have a pair of the next generation GTS 8 which are pretty much the same but in different colors. You can usually get the GTS 7 at a lower price so I would go with those as I have not experience any big improvements with the GTS 8s."
2,First pair I've had,I have always bought Mizuno for walking daily about 4 miles. They didn't carry Mizunos anymore so the salesman recommended Brooks. I have now developed a painful corn between my 4th and little toe that he has tried to fix with an insert and tying my shoes tighter. It still hurts after walking on it for a while. Never had the problem with Mizuno. I will be going back to Mizuno.
3,Good Debut Novel,"I think that ""Off The Hook"" is a good story about the very common experiences of young, black women and their inability to make sound decisions for various reasons. Ms. Wimby has done a great job in making the situations that happen in the book seem real with catchy dialogue and expressive scenes throughout the novel. However, I do feel that Ciara could have cut down on the use of ""proper grammar"" in areas of conversation where it really wasn't called for. For example, substituting ""they're"" for ""they are"" in a character's dialogue.The story was well thought out and planned, however, it did lend itself to just a bit of predictability. I basically knew the outcome of each character's situation before I turned the page.Overall, I feel that Ciara Wimby's debut novel was very well written and I'm looking forward to her next novel. More importantly, I'm looking forward to supporting the efforts of a young, black writer."
4,Engaging Debut,"Ciara Wimby's debut novel is engaging, fast paced and ""Off The Hook"". It captures your attention from page one until the end. I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever had relationship drama ... well, I guess that's everybody, who hasn't had drama in a relationship at one time or another?"
4,Erasure-esque Sounds!,"This album sounded pretty familiar: It copies the sound from one of the best syth-pop bands which is Erasure. You can hear it on ""En que Momento"", which has elements that sound exactly like Erasure's ""Run to The Sun."" This album is overall good, except that the songs are less upbeat, and more like electro-ballads. Not really an essential album if you are an occassional listener. Get it if you are Moenia completist.Este disco me parecio muy familiar, pues tiene sonidos que Erasure utiliza en sus exitos, como ""Run To The Sun"". Las canciones son menos bailables, y hay mas baladas en este disco. No es muy esencial en tu coleccion si eres no mas un escuchante ocasional. Compralo si quieres completar tu coleccion de discos de Moenia."
1,What happened to this once great band????,"Wow, this album is terrible. What were these guys thinking when they released this??? After the last two records by these guys, I was so pumped for this one... but was so disappointed. At The Arcade, Class Of '88 (always have to skip to the next track when I hear this one because of the stupid intro that lasts forever!!!), Major Tom, etc... they are all terrible. Guys after the greatness of Party and Endless Summer, this is unforgivable!!!!"
5,Jesus Jones' best CD,"This is, by far, Jesus Jones' best CD. It's more techno oriented than their other releases, and really rocks too. I like Doubt, but if all their CDs were retreads of that then they'd be called the Fixx. And like the Fixx their songs would be instantly recognizable and just as quickly forgettable."
1,Thought Provoking But Morally Sad,"So we justify the murder of unborn children in the name of giving birth to other children? What moral non-sense. Amazing that as a Jew she did not know the story of Moses. How the midwives did not give into fear and stood their moral ground. This is a lesson on how pride and self-centeredness will lead to murder.The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live. (Exodus 1:17)For a serious contrast to this hopelessness read or watch The Hiding Place. The difference is night and day, life and death."
5,Late review but this is one of Kenny's BEST!,"This is one of my favorite KC albums. There's a lot of fun up-tempo tracks including my favorites ""fall in love"" and ""honey would you stand by me"" and it also contains some of his best ballads in ""all I need to know"" and ""me and you"". From beginning to end you will totally enjoy this CD. You will never be disappointed with a Kenny Chesney album. Get them all!"
