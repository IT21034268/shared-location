4,Great Performance.....Sounds a little cold,"I agree with another reviewer that the technical merits of this performance are hindered by some lack of urgency. I am a huge fan of the Mahler 9 and this recording is a good buy for someone looking for a tight performance. It is my opinion, however, that the performance bears some mechanical characteristics which keep me from giving it more than 4 stars. Might give it 4.5 stars if I could."
4,Blackmores Swan Song,"I would have to say if not for Blackmore's stoic and selfish attitude I would give this DVD five plus stars. The audio and video are great.Having seen many legendary rock groups over the years at Winterland in San Francisco I consider concerts to not only be about the music but a event as well.You could see the other members of the band giving their all, with Ritchie holding back. I love Ritchie Blackmores playing and his music but in this show his heart is not in his playing. I still recommend buying this DVD,s but you would think in Blackmore's last days with Deep Purple he would of wanted to go out like a ball of fire instead of a puff of smoke."
1,Non-stick Stickers!,"I do not recommend this product. The ""stickers"" did not stick to the wall at all and was a huge disappointment!"
5,Outstanding Crim Text,"This is an outstanding criminology text. I have used this text for over ten years and students have been incredibly satisfied. It is reasonably priced, easy to read, and quite comprehensive in terms of the theories. It is also well written and includes numerous useful case studies. Highest recommendation!"
4,Great Music Past,"I had been listening to some soft hits of the past on satellite channel and up came John Secada. It was so uplifting and enjoyable, I just had to purchase a CD by him. It was a great choice and I am enjoying listening to his voice and vibrant sounds."
3,hmph... ok,I really thought I would learn to love this album--- but I really only like the biggest hit (track #1)
2,red vs black sled,This sled was given to my grandchildren for Christmas. I bought it andthe winter heat sled. This one did not perform near as well as theblack sled. My son said lots of the children in the neighborhood enjoyedthe black sled. The red one just didn't go well on the ice that theywere sledding on. Maybe on deep snow it would perform better
3,"Fabulous book, but...","I am eager to give this item as a gift to my son's girlfriend. She loves rice and has been looking forward to learning how to cook. This book has many images, but none of them are of the actual dishes. They are mostly of the cultures who use particular rice grains or of the grains themselves. I am not unhappy with this as I think the book was meant to be presented that way and I was aware of that before I purchased the book. However, I was disappointed that the manufacturer or a packager, perhaps, got glue all over the back cover, and in trying to remove the glue I also managed to scuff the surface. I am not as excited about giving it to her now."
3,So far so good,"This shower curtain liner is so far as expected and advertised, no problems to report. I mostly love the suction cups on either side that adhere to the tile."
4,Add this to your Jazz collection,"My wife is a big George Benson fan and I have been lukewarm on him, knowing only his more commercial recordings of the 1970s and 1980s.But on a whim I decided to buy this early Benson recording for her and I promptly fell in love with it.Be forewarned - it is nothing like the George Benson everyone knows.The is a pure, basic, classic Jazz recording with no vocals. Very relaxing, very well put together, and very much worth a spot on your Jazz shelf."
3,"Routine ""rags to riches"" gangster saga","Stars Bruce Ramsay, Tony Nardi, Costas Mandylor, Edward James Olmos, and special appearances by Robert Loggia, Patti Lupone, and Martin Landau as the elder version of Ramsay's characterWARNING: SPOILERS AHEADImmingrant flees Sicily to seek a better life in America. He tries to be an honest citizen but is lured into the world of the Mafia. He becomes the right-hand to a powerful don, and, subsequently becomes the MAN himself. AT 26, he begins a long, career as a ""respected"" Mafia chieftan, occasionally running afoul of the law that frequently happens to be in his back pocket.That's the movie in a nutshell, or perhaps, a TOMMY GUN."
4,very good movie,"this is actually 2 movies on this dvd. it is based of the same book as the other movie about bonnano. but the vhs movie that i have has parts of both movies on this dvd and a better ending, however i cannot find that movie on dvd. but a great movie with a lot of backstory.if you like books on the mafia and the bonnano family this has a lot of information. get it"
1,Quality of the rubber is bad,I ordered four of these blender Gaskets. The quality of the rubber is substandard and easily torn. Also the width of the Gaskets is a little too wide compared to the original gasket that came along when I purchased the blender.
3,Pretty good!,"I really liked the storylines of the man who is family oriented,but deep down is warm,but cold to the general public. However,I liked the idea of a museum collector and a pi whose shirts are so loud,they should be outlawed(ha)"
3,Review of C.S. Lewis' The Screwtape Letters,"The cover of the book I received is different from the one I ordered but other than that I don't have much complaint.This book is quite interesting. I've only read the first five letters of the book, but there are all kinds of different tactics that Uncle Screwtape and his dear Wormwood use to try to secure the damnation of a new Christian. I like it but the only thing I think is missing in it is the dialog from Wormwood to Uncle Screwtape."
1,"Not ""Strings"", there is only one in the package!","The description says ""Cello Strings"". It is actually just one string. Don't be fooled! I would call this false advertising."
5,Real requirements for security,"""Building Secure Software"" is superb! It starts with a general introduction and then builds on the fact that security must be designed in, not just added later. The second half of the book is many details about buffer overflow problems, access control, race conditions, randomness, and cryptography with enough information to satisfy almost everybody (but simple enough at the beginning to let the novice understand the general topic). Plus, I like their writing style."
1,"Worthless! The ""wrong"" way to look at security","I don't know about John Viega, but Gary McGraw has written some of the worst security books ever, proving to me that he has little if any idea about how ""proper"" security should be run. This book talks about one tiny part of the security equation, missing out on the hardware element, but most importantly on the ""people"" aspect. Anyone ever hear of social engineering? You wouldn't if you read this garabage. Save your money - buy ""Hacking Exposed"" or ""Secrets and Lies"". This is only the right way to bring on security problems."
1,Save Your Money!,"Ham radio overview should have been the title. This book is all bones and no meat and would be a waste of money to even a beginning ham.I would highly recommend ""Ham Radio for Dummies"", which in my opinion, is the best book out ther for beginners and as a reference."
1,Wish I could tell you...,"It has been over a month and I still have not received this CD. The package arrived empty and all of my attempts to contact Amazon and the seller through email and comments have fallen on deaf ears...I wish I could tell you how great the CD is but alas, I have no idea."
3,Better than old school maps but putzy,"I purchased Garmin City Navigator Europe NT for a recent trip to the UK and France. It was as all Garmin disks somewhat a pain to load and unlock. Once on my computer, it was another project to transfer data to my GPS. This software has so many layers (a strength AND weakness) that loads of useless information can make a tiny GPS screen overwhelmed by ""Points of Interest"" of all kinds. I must have inadvertently checked (or it was defaulted) routing to avoid toll roads, the fastest way to get around in France. This left us on some wild backroad adventuring thru the countryside of Normandy. All in all, travelling in a country where ones grasp of the native language is limited (me-French), it was an invaluable tool."
2,Better off getting the map on micoSD/SD-memory card.,"If you purchase the DVD version, you will have to register it with your GPS and the map will be locked to it forever. You are better off gettingGarmin City Navigator Europe NT 2012 Map Card MicroSD/SD. The microSD/SD-card version has the same detail as the DVD version. The advantage - especially if you are not planning to take many trips to Europe - is that with the map on the card, you can share it, give it to a friend, or you can sell it! So, it is like renting the map. Also, if you decide to upgrade your GPS, or if your GPS stops working, you can use the map on SD-card in your new GPS."
3,NOT the latest version!,"I'm going on a trip to Turkey, and checked out the City Navigator NT Europe information at the Garmin website, which promised detailed maps of major cities and intercity roads. Those are absent from the DVD. The Turkey information is in version 2010.20, and the latest version available on DVD seems to be 2010.10. I had to contact Garmin support and request a download of the update in order to get the advertised maps.Installing the maps from the DVD was straightforward. Installing the maps from the update was not."
4,Europe NT,We recently used the Garmin City Navigator Europe NT 2010 version in Greece. For the most part it served us very well although satellite coverage was often inconsistent up and in mountainous areas. That caused us to miss a few turns but we never got lost!
4,Garmin western europe maps helped sometimes,"I used the latest Garmin City Navigator for Europe NT. There were pockets of data not availible in eastern France, Luxemburg and Germany around Vianden to St Goar. Otherwise, it helped us navigate sufficiently. JB"
4,Good Overview of Tolkien's life,"This was my first biography of Tolkien. My only complaint is that it was too short. It was a good picture of 20th Century England and a picture of professors who actually cared about their topics of study. I really enjoyed reading about the expansion of popularity of Tolkien on pop-culture. And this book only goes to the mid-1970's! I found myself wishing that I could read his analysis on more recent impacts of Tolkien including a new generation of Middle Earth lovers, the modern role-playing game industry, the recently completed movie trilogy and even the online game, Lord of the Rings Online."
5,An irreplacable documentation of nutritional history.,"In the late 1930's Dr Price, a retired dentist, travelled to areas of the world where processed food was only beginning to be available and examined the teeth and health of people of the generations before and during the introduction of such food. The result is a valuable historical documentation of the damage done by the consumption processed foods. :-{}"
2,valuable but old information,"The information presented on nutrition and physical degeneration was interesting, but old. I much prefer the books that are written based on current research."
5,WHAT IS WITH THAT COVER,WHY DID FEIST LET THEM USE THAT STUPID COVER. I COULD HAVE DRAWN THAT. I WAS TERRIBLY EMBARASSED WHEN I CARRIED IT HOME THROUGH THE MALL. THAT COVER NOW RESIDES IN THE CITY DUMP. ALSO WHAT IS IT WITH YOU PEOPLE WHO DONT KNOW WHO NAKOR IS. HE HAS BEEN A MAIN CHARECTOR THROUGHT THE SERIES!!!! ARE YOU PEOLE STUPID OR DID YOU NOT READ THE OTHER THREE BOOKS (I'M GUESSING STUPID)THANX FOR THE TIME KIDDIESENJOY
2,People have a right to be disapointed,"To the reviewer who is ""disgusted"" by all the critical reviews: the Legacy series was published after the Serpent War series, so people have every right to ask who this Sidi character is. Also, there is a big difference between having typos in a dinky Amazon.com review and having them in a published work that has gone through professional editors.Now, as to SoaBC, I really feel like Fiest just phoned the last couple of books in this series in. I think he had a few could ideas at the start of the series, but just ran out of gas half way through. Particularly the last two books in the series, he seemed to paint himself into a corner and have to do a lot of hand waving to get himself out. I really think the pace, plot, characterizations, and writing just come nowhere near the original Riftwar sage in quality."
1,Who killed Raymond E. Feist?,"I'm convinced someone murdered Feist after the magician series and then stole his name. If you enjoy going to family reunions and hearing about stories you heard a dozen times, then pick this book up.If you have trouble sleeping, pick this book up.A book that starts nowhere, goes nowhere, and ends nowhere...I think this is it for Feist for me."
2,"Please, no more books of ""Midkemian Boredom""!","I'm currently reading Faerie Tale, which our local library has just bought, and I'm really enjoying that novel, while the ""Serpent War Silliness Series"" is boring and confusing me.Here's an idea: Why doesn't Feist liscense (did I spell that right?) out his world of Midkemia to some some young and eager fantasy writer, who could perhaps show a little more enthusiasm and creativity for this potentially great fantasy world?"
3,Enjoyable Fantasy,"Certainly not Feist's best. But enjoyable nonetheless. I think Feist was a bit on his autopilot when he wrote this. Certainly all the ingredients of a good book, yet somehow it isn't quite up to his usual standards. Maybe because it feels like your average part 4... more of the same."
5,A Passion for the science of flight,"It is a fantastic history of the art of Aviation and Navigation. One of the most succinct I have read. Gives a great background of the science of flight and navigation relating it all the way back to the earliest trips of man. By this description one may expect a dry encyclopedic recall of navigation fact, however what makes this work so strong is the passion that works like a glue holding the work together. Its not a quick read but its density and passion will keep the reader enthused."
1,terrible rocker!!!,"this chair is just awful, from start to finish. i wish i could give it no stars. not only did the chair begin to wobble like another reviewer wrote, mine also began cracking and one of the legs actually snapped off, not a safe chair for baby! i contacted the company several times before i got a response and when i finally did they said ""maybe the chair only lasts a few months."" then they stated they do not guarantee that their furniture will last for any length of time. mine only lasted two months. now i am stcuk with a pile of cheap wood. i don't know who wrote the 4 star review, but i have a feeling it was someone from the company. this company also lied to the BBB when i reported them."
3,Thought it would be leather. I was wrong!,"The cushion was supposed to be leather, and it is not.Not happy with that, and it did not line up well, when putting it together.other than that only time will tell."
4,A Must Have!,"Since receiving this CD, I have listened to it a couple of times, so far, and like it very much. Michael Ball's talent comes through on this one! I especially like the songs, Always on My Mind, and the song Michael wrote himself-Someone Elses Dream. The orchestration is good also, on the entire recording. I am glad that I decided to include Secrets of Love as part of my Michael Ball collection."
4,Good general book for all kinds of stuff,I got this a something for my son and I to do. We have began reading parts and trying out different projects. We are enjoying it. Although I must admit some of the merit badges seem impossible to get.
1,Not what it appears.,"I was pretty disappointed when I got the book. I thought it was the current handbook. I suppose I should have read the description more closely. But it had a recent copyright date and the picture of the cover is very modern looking, very deceptive. I'm not sure why anyone would want a boyscout handbook from the early 1900's, I read through a little bit and due to modern technologies, most of the information is obsolete. If you are looking for a quaint piece of nostalgia, buy it, if you need a handbook for your scout, look elsewhere."
3,"Beautiful, inspiring, very difficult to follow","This book is beautiful. The descriptions and recipes make you want to get to work. But making sense of the recipes is very difficult. I'm a very experienced cook but almost every recipe was baffling in some way. Ingredients are listed but never referred to (the butter in the anise cookies), other ingredients seem to be left out, complex dishes seem to require steps that serve no purpose. The crepes with their delicious glaze get stuck in when you put them on the plate. One can only guess what almond powder is. These books by Verge deserve thoughtful editing and translating and a run through in a test kitchen. Without that, they're basically coffee table books."
3,Worth watching for rare look at Jerusalem,"Plot somewhat annoying and I believe political. The director's first film had a career in politics. However, never mind the mindless plot, storyline, and poor acting of the younger nobody actors. Peter O'Toole saves the film by putting on a superb acting performance by all accounts. He saves the storyline that's all, the story is still not worth watching and amateur. However, I never saw a film that catches Jerusalem streets and the wonderful scenery of the God's city. D.Soref, the director, must have pulled some strings within the city's government to be able to see this rare look at the most religious and important city in the world."
3,Remembering the Earliest Victims of AIDS,"This is the story of what happened to a few lives in France when AIDS was first diagnosed and the world struggled to understand this new mystery illness that was so devastating.It follows the life of a young man, fresh from the countryside as he discovers Paris, life and sex. He becomes entangled with a married police detective from the vice squad, and plationically with an older doctor. The doctor realizes he is an early AIDS victim and tries his best to keep him alive. The police detective struggles with knowing he might have caught the disease and even passed it to his wife.It is a fast-paced and well-done movie and clearly recalls many of the horrors associated with the earliest forms of this dreadful disease, when no medications were sufficient to control it."
2,Flimsy & Broken,"The feeder arrived totally broken, mostly because it was sent with the worst mail order packing job I have ever seen. Huge box with about 2 yards of brown paper barely wrapped around a birdfeeder that obviously bounced around in a smashed box. In addition, the feeder was very poorly constructed, thin plastic, with each tube made of two pieces of plastic loosely glued together and one piece had totally snapped near base. I would never consider ordering this feeder again. Amazon needs to figure out a way to do a better packing job at Christmas, especially if using UPS since they treat packages so badly."
3,little detail,showed very few pieces of Francisan. excepted more pics of other patterns and history regarding them.disappointed in this book.
5,Excellent product! Hats off to Litterworks!,This is an amazing product. Unfortunatly the old style littermaid litterboxes were the only good boxes but the littermaid disposal system is a must have if you have one of these littermaid boxes....worth every penny.
2,Could have been put together allot better!!!,"I'm a huge fan of Electronic Dance Music and anything to do with this genre; I've been to both the huge acts and the underground parties. This movie had good intensions, but the way it came together is a little lame. I recommend One Beautiful Day if you like coming of age movies to do with electronic movies."
2,A disappointment...,"The 70's version is much better. In that one the criminals never seem out of control, and their calmness makes them more disturbing. Robert Shaw's performance is particularly chilling. Travolta is tightly wound and regularly explodes which becomes annoying. Denzel Washington is good as Garber but not as good as Walter Mathau. The earlier version also has a better plot. Writers of the remake appear to have been paid by the curse word and were intent on extracting full value. This detracts from a decent movie."
3,"Stellar Cast, But Doesn't Quite Live Up To Your Expectations!!","First and foremost, this film is a renter, not an owner!Great cast of John Travolta, Denzel Washington, John Tuturro,James Gandolfini and others...yes, it has car crashes, quick edits,violence, explosions, SWAT, NYC in the backdrop...all the usual suspects.But that's just it...all the usual ingredients make this film just a mediocremeal with not much else to offer. I literally found myself guessing what was goinghappen before it was going to happen...a bad sign that there's no twists or spinsto draw you in, make you care what happens next...get it?In closing, as I said in the opening...glad I rented it instead of buying it."
1,"The Taking of Your Money, 123","In between the stop-motion/cross cutting, lack of a good script and predictable acting, the only train robbery going on is the money you pay to see this stupid movie. It's truly style over substance. I mean really, John Travolta plays a psychopath, John Tutturo is an abrasive a-hole and Denzel Washington is mild mannered. How new and groundbreaking. Just incredibly inane. You should either read the book or watch the 1974 version, where although the only A-List actor in it (at the time) is Walter Mathauw, the supporting and character actors put on class performances where you really get the feel of NY Grit."
5,Taking of Pelham 123,"Very pleased with this DVD....the service, delivery and condition.Would deal with this vendor anytime!!!Dan Cotter"
1,Simply Terrible,"(Spoilers, though there isn't much to spoil) I've not seen the original but this movie is just awful. Have you seen the previews? Oh, then you have seen the movie. Bad guy gets train, innocent bystander stops him and ends up hero in end. Well that about wraps up my review, enjoy this predictable and boring tale of the one man army. I mean, at least put a twist or something in there, one clever thing, that's all I wanted..."
3,"Lame and Predictable, but Still Watchable","""The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3"" is a re-make, and in it two experienced actors Denzel Washington and John Travolta reprise familiar franchise roles. Denzel Washington plays Walter Garber, a family man and transit officer who must take a bribe to send his two children to college but who is determined to do good - a role that he's played countless times, most recently as Detective Keith Frazier in Spike Lee's ""Inside Man."" John Travolta plays criminal mastermind Ryder who hijacks a subway car to get rich and to exact vengeance on society - a role that he's played countless times, most recently in ""Basic"" and ""Swordfish.""The movie is lame and predictable, and what holds it together are the startling cinematography, fast competent editing, and the dynamic between these two seasoned professionals doing what they do best."
3,boring,I dint really like this movie I mean I love Travolta and Washington but this movie was boring it failed lots of action and it just takes place in pretty much two places nothing really happens overall I think it was a very boring movie.
5,Method Man and Mary J. Blige..I Think.,This is a great single..The song is excellent for anyone really..it is a gangster type love song but it is incredably sweet...A beautifully written song..I don't normally listen to Method Man..So I can't say one of his best but if I had to guess it probably is ONE OF HIS BEST!!
4,Great intro to Penderecki,"Unlike his immensely dissonant works like the ""Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima"" this work is quite pleasant and melodic. It is not however to be confused with easy listening. The work isn't accessible per se, but it certainly isn't unaccessible either. Let's just say that it is a splendid piece of music that will require a little effort on the listener's part, but hey, anybody reading this review is probably willing to put in the work. I think you'll enjoy it greatly. Mutter's playing is quite notable too."
4,My Luke and I,A non-traditional view of baseball's Lou Gehrig. Full of background information especially Eleanor's that has not been seen elsewhere.
3,interesting,"This book was kind of interesting to get a glimpse of what ayoung persons life might have been like in Chicago during the 20'sand 30's. The facts surrounding Lou's diagnosis and treatment differfrom the most current and extensive biography written on him, which I justfinished reading. But it was a light, fun read."
2,A real slog,"I know H. James is considered one of the ""Greats"" of American literature and I question my taste for hating most of his writing. With few exceptions I think he is a pretentious purveyor of obscurantism. I read Wings of the Dove many years ago in the days when I would not allow myself to set aside books I did not enjoy. I recently picked up a collection of his short stories and remembered why I disliked him so much. Now in my old age I had no pangs of conscience when I happily closed the book before finishing it. If more of the stories had been like Daisy Miller I would have proceeded further but unfortunately much of the writing reminded me of Wings. I am currently seeking relief from Henry's turgid prose by reading Hemingway. I'd trade in a Henry for an Ernie any day. It's also difficult to like Mr. James' snobbish, shallow and unsympathetic characters. The more sympathetic ones were obscured by his heavy hand and my impatience with his style."
3,It's a fairly dull documentary about a really interesting artist.,"While it's a fairly dull documentary about a really interesting artist, this video does provide a lot of insight into his methodology. Great information for art students and art courses.."
3,Not great for little ones,This toy is not that great for little ones. The ribbons are not long enough to grab onto and the ball is very hard to hold. it may be better as my child gets older (7 months now).
5,Excellent Reference,"One of the best of Dover. Might be a litlebit advanced though, if you are a real beginner."
3,"Classic, but dark","The classic mother goose stories, poems, rhymes etc are kinda dark and can be a bit too old for younger kids. There are a lot of items in here for the kids, but many I have never heard of and end up skipping."
1,I'm glad I read the reviews first!,I love this movie. I was about to purchase it until I realized it was not the complete version. I'm glad I read the reviews first. I think this is the best movie Lifetime has shown. It's a pity they don't put the entire movie on dvd!
1,Final Justice,I wish I would have read the other customer reviews before buying this dvd. I didn't realize it was cut to bits...I wouldn't have bought it knowing that!!!
5,Investment Planning with God as your advisor!,"Alan Gotthardt details a great plan for investing. He's got the certifications, and I loved his vivid concepts and diagrams. Simple to read book that will motivate one to use God's principles for creating wealth for you and your loved ones! Another must read for your financial planning and investing book collection. Another beautiful system that will bring you wealth and help you build God's planet in eternity!"
2,Hogwash,"I am a lifelong resident of Arkansas and was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas. I have known Bill Clinton my entire life and also am familiar with the Dixie Mafia. While this book was very entertaining, it was woefully inaccurate. I can only hope that rational Americans will not buy into this book. With all of the investigations of Bill Clinton, and Kenneth Starr's obvious hunger to indict him, don't you think he would have stumbled onto some of this by now. Please, give me a break. Save your money, and buy No Island of Sanity instead."
2,there's no need to explain death with God everywhere.,"We are not religious and thought this was not a religious book,we are very dissapointed at it.Nobody says that it mentions ""GOD"" everywhere"
5,From a Bongart student....,"This lavish book is in character with its subject! A multitude of gorgeous images of Sergei's work and the sweeping account of his remarkable life will fill your heart and mind with inspiration. In addition, the section compiled from his students' recollections offer his philosophy and priceless concepts on painting and fine art. If you like color, he was the master of masters! As a bonus, this comprehensive book includes some of his poetry and compositions on art.

1,Weak Support System,Beware of this pack. After loading it up with 35lbs and attempting to put if on my back the shoulder strap support system ripped and rendered the backpack useless. The shoulder straps are attached to a Velcro Adjustment tab which proved to not be very durable in my case.
2,Honestly a sub par bag..,"This bag really isn't that great.. If your equipment is 100% super compact and ultra light, this might work. If your equipment is at all bulky or anything, don't get this bag; you will need more space. I am usually the leader and the one carrying the most stuff, biggest tent etc. If this is you, stick with an external frame or sink real money into a respectable internal frame backpack."
4,Teton Sports Fox 75+10L Internal Frame Backpack (Blue),"The quality of the haversack is excellent, the fabric and seams have very good quality and resistance"
1,Does not stay on the shower rod,These hooks do not have enough curve to them. Opening and closing the shower curtain causes the hooks to come off the rod. It was so annoying that I went back to our old tropical fish curtain hooks with the penguin curtain.
1,..,"installed it, but the software and drivers can never be found, and when the nero software starts it does not work and its a waste of money, dvd fails to run now as well."
1,Death piece,"Died after the first two weeks.It does not died completely. Motherboard can find the drive, but sometimes cannot recognize. Sometimes every thing looks good, but when read a disc, it fails. I was thinking it is because of the disc, but after tried some more discs and tried them in another machine, I am sure it is because of the drive.When try to write a disc, it keep telling the disc is not writable, please enter a empty disc..."
1,"Not Again,same as last CD","I just heard the samples of Icons of evil. I'm sorry but this is nothing but noise just like the last cd. I have nothing bad to say about the band but what are you thinking? It's now selling for $4.99 The drums sound like a drum machine, are turn tables next? What ever happened to the real Vital Remains? Why can't you write like the 1992 Let Us Pray Album? Now that's Metal! I'm just as evil as the next but Dave maybe you should start your own band called vital chipmonks. That faster than fast metal is like listening to The Bay City Rollers on 78 rpm.jbell"
3,cool,"great song ""untitled"" is, but I think we all love this song so much is because of the imfamous video."
3,It's okay...,"I expected a lot more after reading the reviews for this book. The lessons are not much more than a devotion for kids and there are very few object lessons. It definitely is not worth $23. There are other books that are just as helpful as this one for much, much less."
2,Not one of Anthony's best books,"I have to be honest here--this is the one novel by Anthony that I just couldn't finish. I had absolutely no interest in the plot, characters or narrative voice used. Don't get me wrong, there are things to admire about the book but admiration doesn't mean it's a great novel or even a good one.There are enough recaps of the plot here so I won't go there. Let's just say this is the least appealing of her well written books. Someone commented that it had moronic plotting. I don't think that's the case, it's just not a compelling or interesting story. Everybody stumbles. We sometimes race along at such a pace that we don't pay attention to the cracks in the sidewalk or the uneven pavement. Here Anthony fell in love with the concept of creating a novel around her beloved Brazil. Unfortunately, the concept is much better than the execution."
3,Nice complact tool,I like it..it's nice to have 5 in 1. I didn't get anything to hold the reflector with (my bad) so it takes a person to hold the thing.
1,loud smell,"smell is not good , i will not buy amymore!it was just a cheap loud alcoho odor.very unsatisatfied!! not for mel"
3,Good reference,"The Eyewitness series aren't my absolute favorite travel books but I do find them to be good references (if I'm ever bored in Florence, I can always read up on the difference species of roadside flowers or how a hummingbird hawk moth eats). I do like the fact that the books are crammed full of pictures (yes, even that pesky hawk moth is in there!). This is a good addition to any travel book library.--Vicki Landes, author of ""Europe For The Senses - A Photographic Journal"""
2,So thin that you can see through them!,"While these are ok for lounging, they will not keep you very warm. As other reviews state, these are incredibly thing...so much so that you can easily see light coming through them. I wouldn't even think about playing any kind of sport in these, unless you consider chess to be a sport. Would have been nice if they were described as ""lightweight""."
2,Russell Athletic Men's Cotton Performance Elastic Bottom Jersey Pant,RA bottom pants are HUGE - size charts for these are completely inaccurate so be aware of this when purchasing!
3,Comfy,"I like these type of pants because I have a very short inseam and with the ankle elastic (which is NOT constricting in any way) I don't have to worry about how long they'll be. I found the sizing to run large, so in the future I will order one size smaller. I previously bought Champion brand and they are a thicker material and seem a little more substancial. The Russell brand are of a thinner jersey knit which is better suited to summer wear. I wear this type of pant year around for the comfort. They are roomy, have side pockets and elastic at the waist and ankles, and look neat if you have to run an errand or go to the doctor's office."
1,"Not ""heavyweight"" as advertised","While these pants seem to be of good quality, they certainly aren't as advertised. I purchased two pairs of them thinking they were made of heavyweight material, since that's what the product description says. However, they are very lightweight and aren't good for anything other than sitting around the house. I'll keep them just for that purpose but I am disappointed that I can't use them to go running in the cold weather (what I'd originally purchased them for). I wish I'd have read the reviews before buying these, as others have made the exact same complaint. The product description should be updated to say that they are lightweight. Otherwise, it's very misleading."
5,VERY COMFORTABLE,"These are the most comfortable pair of pants I have ever worn. They are lose but sturdy. They are great for anything, even fashionable enough for hanging or with friends. I look forward to wearing these pants on my days off."
1,horrible,"I purchased this item and when it came I was totally disgusted with them, they where not only irregulars but cut in the front and then resewn as if anyone would not notice.They were advertised as 1st quality , will never purchase from this Co. again"
3,They were ok!,The pants were alot thinner than i expected!! Not warm enough for winter wear! Wouldn't get another pair!Their too thin!!!
2,Not 100% cotton,"These are standard sweatpants, nothing out of the ordinary. But they are NOT all cotton; they are the usual 50-50 blend, hence my two star ranking."
3,"They are useable, but way to long","I was looking for a pair of light weight sweats that had a cuffed leg on the bottom. It seems that all that are available in stores are the straight uncured bottoms. i found these and ordered them and will keep them, but, and this is a big but, they are very long. I'm 5'11"" and I'd day these are 8"" too long. I would love it if this product cam in short, regular and long sizes."
5,Russell light sweat pants,"Great lightweight warmup pant , not fleese. I use to work out in and lounging. These are made of lightweight cotton mix."
1,thin as paper,"I thought that these sweatpants were going to be of a better quality, i saw some of the reviews say that they would use them as pajamas, who does that? you buy sweats for nighty-nite? these pants are cheap, very oversized, and wouldn't last a week on the job. buyer beware."
3,Elastic leg bottom,"This is the Item description ""Elastic waistband with inside drawstring and elastic leg bottoms"". The description clearly describes Elastic ""Leg Bottoms"". However, the picture does not show the Elastic Bottom. It shows a photo of ""No Elastic"" for the bottom. So is the Picture accurate? Or the Statement?"
1,Cheap,"Low quality all around. Thin flimsy fabric and lightweight elastic. Plus sized wrong, ordered XL, item tagged XL but was at least 2X or 3X. Amazon did do a prompt refund.Better deal is theChampion Mens Closed Bottom Jersey Pant- lower price and better quality than the Russell."
2,Not what I wanted,"They were not a sweat pant that i`m use to, I thoughtthey would be alot heavier. I have not wore them yet maybe I will change my Review then"
5,Perfect for exercise & lounging around.,"I continue to be impressed with the versatility of these sweatpants. They are the perfect pair to wear around the house and to the gym. They also fit comfortably in a pair of pull-on winter boots, due to their being lightweight."
4,Very good,"The pants are perfect for hanging around home either inside or outside. I wear them for quick trips to the market or liquor store. I am not a fan of shorts so these pants are good for me. They look nice, are cool and so far launder well."
2,Is it doing anything?,"This product was easy to install, and when I turned my computer back on - Wow!, I had 128 more megabytes of memory.Unfortunately, except for the readout on my computer about more memory, I have seen no other sign that this product is working. My computer is not any faster, I cannot open any more programs at the same time, and some computer games which could not be opened because I didn't quite have enough memory, still can't be opened.I phoned to get help from Viking, and they were friendly, but said the readout on my computer that says I have 128 more megabytes of memory may be the only sign I have that the product is working. This product may be doing great things inside my computer, only I wish it SHOWED some sign of this in my daily computer use."
1,Curse of the Crimson Altar(The Crimson Cult),"Curse of the Crimson Altar(The Crimson Cult On Netflix Instant stream even though the other name shows up when you press play.)Christopher Lee is a superb actor as is of course Boris Karloff as you can see by their roles in this film and the surprise ending,however the film is just a bunch of hippie AND writer H.P.(can't stand his stuff) Lovecraft mumbojumbo occult/pagan matters,there were so many of these films made in the 60's and 70's,this film is a bunch of fruitcakes in s&m garb and some bizarre witch along with a plot that does not make sense.Lee/Karloff are the only reason to watch."
3,cheap but works,"bought for grandfather for reading mail. not heavy duty but works fine for this purpose. this was sort of an experiment as i didn't know if he would use it. consequently, i didn't want to spend a lot. it works, he likes it, if it fails or gets too wobbly i will replace with a sturdier one."
1,DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!,"The reviewers above had just said what I felt. We went to watch a kids film, and left the theater with a feeling of a hole in our chest and surrounded by astonished sad kids and crying moms and dads. What a horrible experience is watching this movie. You really have to be masochistic to like these kind of stories. No fantasy or imagination film whatsoever, just a brutal movie that leave as if you had been to a funeral. It is really cruel for the producers of this film to advertise this as a kids film."
3,Chakra psychoanalysis,"As the subtitle suggests, this book gives a psychological analysis of each of the 7 major chakras. There are 55 pages devoted to each chakra, covering the meaning of its color, its issues, the age of its manifestation, its traumas, character, excesses, deficiencies and how to balance it by resolving its psychological issues. In addition, there are 10 supplemental charts summarizing the various characteristics of the 7. The book is more analytical than spiritual, more doctrinal than experiential and more dry than emotional.The 3 things I found mildly useful were the summary charts, its perspective of being able to blend East and West and its ease of reference by being well organized and summarized. At best, an occasionally useful secondary reference. Well suited for a psychologist looking for a new angle. Not well suited for someone looking for spiritual growth."
1,Not too impressed,"I wasn't impressed with this chair AT ALL The first time it was inflated, the seams burst! My husband blew it up and I used it in the pool for about 30 minutes. I left it on a lounger overnight and the next morning all the seams were shredded. It took several days for all the air to get out so I could return it. Not sure that I would purchase anything else from this manufacturer."
2,not worth 1/2 the price they are asking here,Don't waste your money it's just an inflatable it is so not worth the $100. The material rips and most inflatables rarely last more than a season anyway. If it was made with a thick foam and better material I could see the value of it but this seems like a major scam here.
2,retention bolts,retention bolts weak and broke on installation. I will probably have to drill out the cap and use a through plastic bolt unless the manufacturer would like to send me a new set of bolts.
1,cracked cover,"A few months ago the cover in the inside front of the seat started cracking. And it is still cracking. I have, to date, had to tape 6 different areas with electricians tape. And, as previously mentioned, the seat does NOT stay up. I definitely would NOT buy this seat again."
2,A little conflict would go a long way!,"We played ""Old Joy"" last year at our college theater and the audience (those who stayed awake) were stunned. Nothing much happens in this picture. It has been praised by many critics as a great work of art. I think that's the same mentality that calls a blank canvas a great work of art. This film has good acting (considering they didn't have much of a script to work with) and the photography is beautiful. The main problem with this picture is the total lack of conflict. It seemed like I was watching a 90 minute home movie of friends on a camping trip. The reason good movies keep our interest is the conflict. Without it we may as well just sit and watch the fish swim in an aquarium. This is the kind of film you can go out to the kitchen several times for snacks and make a couple trips to the bathroom without pausing the DVD. You wouldn't miss anything important, anyway. What a shame!"
4,Delightful,"Cordelia Stansbury was absolutely mortified! Her mother trapped Gervaise Valerian, one of the ton's most notorious rakes, in a compromising situation with her just so she could force him to marry her poor spinster daughter. Gervaise was seething with justifiable rage, and Cordelia wanted to sink through the floor. There was no way she was going to let her mother get away with this, even if she had loved Gervaise ever since she was a little girl. She would simply disappear. This comedic romance of double identities, undercover actions and the snobbishness of the English aristocracy is absolutely delightful. The cast of characters can get a little confusing at times, but Ms. Veryan pulls it all together at the end."
5,One of this year's best!,"Italian movie that comes out in the States in 2009. It reminds me of 'Traffic', the way that it tells the story of a scourge that infiltrates society at all levels. In 'Traffic', it was drugs. In 'Gomorrah', the problem is the mafia, and it's control over the slums of Naples. It shows corruption at all levels - governmental, business, and even how the youth get corrupted at such a young age. There are several overlapping storylines, and while it can be a little difficult to follow at times, it's worth the effort. The best foreign movie I've seen since this year, and one of the year's best overall."
1,ENGLAND SELLING DVD'S THAT WON'T WORK IN USA,"ENGLAND SELLING DVD'S THAT WON'T WORK IN USA. They didn't even indicate they were a European area DVD. Why is AMAZON letting them sell these Dvd in the first place. The company REP. send me a e-mail ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS UPDATE YOUR SOFTWARE, YOU UPDATE YOUR SOFTWARE FOR USA SOFTWARE TO PLAY YOUR DVD'S. This is a con hoping you will give up and just throw it away. Not me located the company sent it back and put a dispute in with my credit card company."
3,Fantastic! Until it stopped working...,"I loved my Juiceman Jr. I got it at a one day sale for only $52. I didn't want to spend a lot since I was a newbie and it got four star reviews on Amazon. I juiced nearly every day. The only downside was the prepwork and cleanup but I expected that. It's a shorter time than you spend cooking, right? Unfortunately, I've had my juicer for about five months and it's falling apart. It's leaking, no matter how tight I screw on the top piece and the pulp is wet. I feel like half the juice is now being wasted. I still love to juice but I'm going to upgrade to an Omega. If it's as good as they say, it will be worth the investment. Wish me luck!"
2,A great juicer if the lid didn't fall apart,"I bought this juicer with the wonderful thought of juicing. This product worked great for approximately 20 juicings. After that, the lid broke at the bottom of the feed tube. The feed tube has a guide for the food pusher that lasted even less than the lid.When it works, it works great. But very cheap design.Emails to the company went unanswered. So do not expect any warranty coverage. This has basically been a waste of money.If you are looking to juice more than two months go with a different product. This one stinks."
3,Left wanting more,"While I found the book to be entertaining, I was left wanting more. The fast pace switch between characters was alright in the beginning, but as he began to add more and more characters, it became a pain trying to remember who was who, all while trying to divulge the underlying plot. The plot to this story is hard to make out. It's just a series of events, some of which are irrelevent, that don't fully explain the ending. The ending came completely out of the blue. While I do believe that Nick McDonell has great potential especially for his age, I don't believe that Twelve was the best that he could have done."
1,prep school fantasy,"TWELVE isn't the worst book ever, it just isn't very good. It's a prep school fantasy by a boy who was good at english and felt that there was something apocalyptic or at least meaningful in the teenage parties and consumerism that surround him. The upper east side is full of young ironists who quote Veblen and Ellis, sadly McDonell is not one of them, otherwise he would have known better.If you want to read about spoiled rich kids, LESS THAN ZERO is the classic, it's short and funny. The sequel, RULES OF ATTRACTION is pointless, but it should be mandatory reading for anyone thinking of going to an eastern liberal arts college.Ellis borrowed much of his style from Dennis Cooper. If yoou want to read something ""shocking"" TRY is a much better book about missing love and prevalent drugs."
1,Twelve,"Please note that of all of the reviews, the highest ratings were given by 13-year-olds who spell recommend with two c's. That said, Twelve is a predictable adolescent novel with a ridiculous ending that turns what could be interesting characters into nothing more than caricatures: the pretty, but snobby girl, the angry teens, etc. If you want a quick read that won't leave you caring about its characters or plot, go out and buy. If you want to learn something new about NYC's teenaged elite, this is not the book for you."
1,"Dull, Dull, Dull!","I flat out hated this book. It's basically about of a bunch of rich bored teenagers at random spots in New York City. The ending, while I felt it finally got a little interesting, is a huge copout. Whenever I see this book on a shelf at a book store I get the urge to toss it in a trashcan (not that I will ever do that)."
2,Stuck on a plane with nothing to read,"It caught my attention at the airport because a)it was written by a 17 year old and b)I am from NY. I shouldn't have bothered. I finished the book in 2 hours have not spent one moment reflecting on it since. I felt that the story was extremely predictable. You can't fault the writer, he is just a teenager... but what were the publishers thinking? It was like a mad-libs story - we've heard it before... they just changed the characters names, drug name etc..."
1,Want to Have A Kid Perform Onanism Right on Your Face?,"Then you will like this book! Richie Rich wrote a book, and here it is! Ain't that cute...his godfather published his book...awww. Nick McDonell blasts a good one, Pete North-style, on the face of anyone stupid enough to buy this pretty little book."
1,waste of time and money,"having experienced the NY milieu that mcdonell describes in this novel (i'm 19 and an east coast college student), i can tell that he's way off. this book is silly. it's funny how half the good reviews i read on the page below are from teenagers who say things like, 'I know there are people whose lives are like this!' and 'Although I've never experienced the lifestyle the book describes, it's very realistic!' Well, it isn;t. It's made up to disguise a lack of imagination and talent on the author's part. oh, and the writing is terrible."
1,Bright hype big ...,"I too fell for the hype, and even enjoyed the excerpt in the Paris Review, but unfortunately this book epitomizes the notion of overpromise / underdeliver. Some good character ideas, expecially White Mike, but nothing of substance is done with them. The book is written with the subtlety of a bull in a china shop, with none of the many potentials used to any worthwhile measure. While looking for books about adolescent adventures, I tried this, and the next on my list was Trinity Fields, the first two pages of which have thankfully washed Twelve from my memory with its brilliance. Skip this one, and hope that McDonell spends more time developing his inevitable follow-up."
1,"Straight Garbage, With A Helping Of Nepotism SPOILERS","One of the major problems with this book, I feel, other than the fact that Nick McDonell is a talentless brat, is that it reads like a childrens book but deals with real problems.And the plotholes? Claude, used to do ""blizzards"" of cocaine and then kills everyone? What is that? If we apply that logic to the real world, then we'd have there'd be a lot more dead people around.And the chapters? Seriously, dude? One sentence and you're done with the chapter? Take a couple of classes and learn how to write.This kid better count his lucky stars because if his godfather wasn't the head of a publishing company, his ""manuscript"" would have gotten laughed into a garbage can."
3,Not a bad read,"I thought Nick McDonell's book Twelve was an all right read; given his age when he wrote it, I'd give it higher marks. I don't think reading about self-indulgent rich kids from NYC is especially interesting but it's a fast read on the train going to work."
2,very average,reads like a pieced together collection of standard-issue angst - watch the lost manhattan boys and girls flail about - tra la la
2,The only redeeming quality is the nice cover.,I disliked the book. I don't see how the characters in the books are in any way an accurate portrayal of today's youth. The cast of detached characters who don't seem to care about anything quickly gets repetitive and I was left wondering why I was bothering to read it at all.I like the book cover though.
4,Astonished to hear writers age,The writing is mature and the narrative skilled. THe relationship between the youngsters and the adults/parents almost painfully realised. A wonderful piece of work.Overreactions do seem to abound because of the subject matter. Given the nature of the novel clearly some people should avoid. Particularly those confused with the timeline between Hamlet and Monte Cristo!
2,same old same old,"A voice we've heard before, telling a story we all know.Why are cynicism and detachment so stylish these days? Why do we think stories by and about kids -- who by definition don't know very much -- have something to say to the rest of us?I'm tired of stories about kids with too much of everything except character and self-doubt; tired, too, of talented 18-year-olds who don't believe there's much to be said for experiencing life a little and working hard to hone a craft before getting published. This writer would have done better to turn his back on his parents' literary connections, let life toss him around a little, learn everything he could from the masters of living and of writing, and sit down in front of the computer maybe 10 years from now -- then maybe he would have had a story to tell, maybe he would have made something of his obvious talent.As it is, he'll be a tremendous sensation for the next 10 minutes. Too bad."
2,All dressed up with nowhere to go,"Despite his connections in the industry, McDonnell seems to know how to pace the narrative of his choosing. However, he doesn't seem to grasp how to dress his characters in their own clothes. And when he dresses them at all, he sends them to that final party scene which is quite simply the most poorly written finale of a novel I have ever read."
4,"Hoist good for nostalgia, but flimsy workmanship",I have been an advid collector of the re-issues as they have been coming out and I have to say that Hoist is one of the worst as far as construction and workmaship goes. He just seems flimsy and not well put together. Definitely something you would not see from the Takara re-issues.Overall he brings back that nostalgic feeling many of us had when we had these guys as kids but there are better constructed re-issues out there from Hasbro and more so from Takara.
4,Pilgrim: Her Life and Work in Her Own Words,"Peace Pilgrim's message is timeless. Her journey and her writings began in the 1950s yet what Peace has to say resonates in the 21st Century. I often need to stop reading and reflect on her passages, many which validate the teachings in A Course in Miracles. Kudos to Peace Pilgrim. Her message and her methods rank right up there with Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mother Theresa."
5,Peace Pilgrim: Her Life and Work in Her Own Words,"One of the most moving books I have read that speaks of peace. Not only are the words moving, but the life of Peace Pilgrim herself speaks volumes. She lives what she teaches."
2,Terrible treatment of an important collection,"I was looking for an unabridged edition of her letters, rather than a selection, and was thrilled to find this; then when I received it, I found it badly bound, the pages falling out as soon as I opened the book, badly typeset, with no footnotes or other explanatory material. The fault is my own, for not looking up the publisher beforehand; I will certainly avoid them in the future."
1,A lofty title for a worthless book,"As you've probably read in the other listed reviews, the physics review given in this book is worthless. The practice tests completely miss the point of the GRE.Do yourself a favor and download the free practice test provided by ETS. Also check out www.physicsgre.com."
1,Useless Book,"The only concievable use for this book is to maybe use it for a general review, since the questions are absolutely nothing like real GRE questions. Most GRE questions can be answered without a complete calculation, whereas the questions provided require calculations.And, as for using it as review of physics- it is incomplete, unclear in places, and uses terrible non-standard notation.Simply stated, it is not worth buying. Thankfully, I got my copy free from the department."
1,This book annoys me.,"I can point out many reasons why this book must never be bought. The main two are. The review is ridiculously basic. At least, here in Brasil, every high school student knows 70-80% of everything that is written there.. There are lots of errors through the tests. Sometimes the questions are wrong, sometimes the choices are wrong, others the resolution is wrong. And believe me, there are cases where all three are simultanously wrong."
3,Let's see,Hmmm I don't understand why there is so much negativity about this.I think the point is to get ur mind thinking and remembering all the stuff u learned in undergrad.I have only looked at a couple problems so far. One of them had a problem where u had to solve a VERY involved quadratic equation. Not that this is particularly hard to do. But it could easily take like 20 minutes to do by hand. Maybe ten minutes if ur quick.We'll see how it goes.
5,Eric Carmen's Best,"This is undoubtedly Carmen's best album. Each song is beautifully crafted in melody, lyric and arrangements. The production is excellent. Some of Elton John's personnel from this era are on the album, most notably arranger Paul Buckmaster. The finale to ""Run Away"" has similarities to Elton John's ""Funeral for a Friend"", including the percussion of Ray Cooper. I originally owned the LP and pretty much burned it up I listened to it so much. Well worth owning."
4,Finally! Crochet patterns for me instead of Grandma!,"I was pleasantly surprised by the offerings in this book. Most of the patterns include plus sizes, a few even offering XXXL, something I rarely see in a pattern book. In addition to all of the patterns, there are also simple time saving tips, as well as a section on assembling sweater pieces.This is a great book for an intermediate or advanced crocheter, or even an advanced beginner ready to graduate from scarves and afghans."
4,For baseball fans only,"If you are not a rabid baseball fan, read no further. This collection is not for you. On the other hand....The Babe Ruth piece is corny, silly, and tells nothing about the Babe or baseball or anything else. It is merely a curiosity, an attempt to cash in on the Bambino's popularity. He was certainly no actor. The production value are nil.The shorts don't do much to improve the overall--except for the piece about ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame."" Most fans know the song but probably have never heard it in its entirety. The other items are bland and pointless.So why 4 stars? As a piece of the past, embedded in amber."
4,Deep Truth Explained,This book contains informatiom about or within the Bible many clergy avoid and most Christians have never heard. Excellent source for those who are sincere in the study God's Word.
1,Wrong color,Ordered blue they sent me pink so I returned the item!-----and found the exact same item (in the color I wanted) at my local Ace Hardware store for less $$!!!!!!!
4,Good bang for my buck,"Nice and small, it's compact enough to keep above a chest of drawers and powerful enough to keep our entire 2nd floor (it's a converted attic, approximately 10' x 30') free of that dingy, dusty scent that seemed to plague it. A bit noisy on the highest setting, but if you only use it during the day when you're not home, who cares?Works well at the 2nd highest setting, also. And this setting is much quieter and less distracting."
2,Grinding/Clicking noise coming from the fan area!,"I have purchased two of these items. I liked the first item so much that I purchased a second one. Unfortunately, when I opened the second one, it immediately had a HORRIBLE clicking/grinding noise coming from the fan area. I returned the item for a prompt refund. I thought it might have been a fluke, but that appears not to be the case.I really hoped that the first one would continue to work well, but it too is now beginning to show signs of the same clicking/grinding noise only a couple weeks after we set it up. While it is bearable at this point, I have a feeling it will get to the same unbearable point that the other one did.If you decide to purchase this product, I suggest that you keep the packaging for the 30 day return window, just in case you have the same problem I do."
2,Noisy,"Unit was returned because I thought was too loud. In addition I tried it for 5 days in a room where I keep my cat litter box. Left it run 24 hrs. and didn't help the air at all or dust. Filters did not look like they were picking anything up at all. The room size is a 10x10, 100 sq ft. so I'd guess partly my fault since the specs say room size 85 sq ft. Still doesn't explain why filters not even picking up though."
2,Too noisy to use; washable prefilter,"It's nice that it's compact, but even the quietest setting is unbearably loud.The filter light is constantly coming on. I've replaced it with a different filter in the room, and there are other filters in the house; none need a prefilter fix as often as this one days.Taking off the cover, washing the filter (I've come to expect carbon prefilters, so a washable filter that stays in the machine seems strange), waiting for it to dry, putting it back together -- it's a pain when it indicates it wants it done every week or two. Especially when it's not even dirty.But the noise factor alone makes the thing useless. It's ridiculous. In a small room, that noise is the only thing that exists. It might possibly be a good filter, but if I can't even turn it on, it's a never-used, useless filter."
3,Don't Forget Your Converter,"I bought this to fix my eczema. Waited around 2 weeks for it to arrive, bought my America-Australia adaptor, and started it up. It blew up in 5 seconds. My face was blank for around 1 whole minute before I raged in fury. Don't forget your converter! Otherwise you would have wasted around $150 on NOTHING."
4,Nice little air filter.,"I bought this because my husband smokes, and I don't. Our computers, which we're on a good bit of the evening, are in a small 10x14 room. This little machine makes that much more bearable. I am very pleased with my purchase."
2,Motor Burned Out,"My unit died after a week of use on 'high'. I would return it, but being overseas, it's not worth the cost, time, or trouble. I found a unit that was almost identical at a thrift shop and brought that home. I put the nice and clean filter from the honeywell into this new unit. It didn't last through the night, running on 'high'. Both fans are dead in the exact same way. The motor doesn't start, turn, hum, anything. It acts like it isn't getting any electricity. I've taken it apart and nothing seems wrong. I think the motor just burned out. So I'm going to call this one a loss. Now to look for a filter made by someone else."
2,Not Good,"Ok, I tried this and I can say I don't like it. I got a vacuum filter and a flashlight to test this. I got the air purifier blowing in my face and created some dust in the air. I could see the dust blowing into my face and it irritated my eyes. The only reason that this got two stars, is because it made white noise that helped me fall asleep. Overall, good white noise maker, bad air purifier."
4,Nice little unit,"Use it one office and move to bedroom when finished. Easy to move. Wife thinks she can tell a difference, and she is PICKY. A little louder than I would like, but for the price, worth a try for a small space or single room."
2,Sounds like a jet engine,"Despite what the previous reviews and the description of the product say, this thing is LOUD. I'm usually not sensitive to noise but I can't sleep with this machine on medium or high. Low is bearable but only because I don't mind the white noise.Also, I bought this thinking it would help my allergies in the morning by cutting down on the mold (I live in an old building) but it hasn't helped at all. It's possible it would work on high, but then I wouldn't be able to sleep."
4,air filter,"have use this for 6 months and makes a big difference at night, dust levels have dropped so less dusting."
3,This thing is LOUD,"I bought this after reading the many reviews saying how this product is super quiet. It isn't. The lowest setting is really *really* loud, while the highest setting is slightly louder. I can't sleep with it on because the noise is loud enough to drown out the sound of my alarm clock and when I'm not sleeping this thing will make my ears ring if I leave it on too long.As for the air purifying ability of this product, phenomenal. I bought this for my study abroad in Moscow and I am so glad I did. The air quality here is so poor that I can barely breath sometimes and allergy season is starting so that just makes it that much worse. When I come home from class, or if I start wheezing when I'm at home I turn this on and within minutes I can breath again.If you have a small room/dorm and are deaf/don't care about loud noises definitely get this."
2,too loud,Its too loud. Not sure how well it does the job since I only had it 2 days but its too loud to matter
5,Breathing Better,I am 65 years old and have COPD and allergies. Since putting this in my bedroom my allergies bother me far less than before and I just generally breath easier especially at night. I am thinking about getting the bigger one for the living room.
3,Nice but loud,"I don't care what anyone says, this thing is LOUD. There are 2 fans inside that are blowing air, so the noise is expected. My room seems a lot cooler now that i started using it. I leave it on during the daytime, but at night I have to turn it off before going to sleep, otherwise i hear this big humming from the fans that I just cannot ignore.I cannot comment about durability and effectiveness since I just used it for 2 days."
3,Does it's job,"I've had this unit for about 3 months now, and I run it most of the time when I am at home. So far it has run quite well and cleaned up the air quite a bit. It's got some noise to it, but It's not terribly loud and unless you require dead silence, it's not hard to sleep with it on. There is one problem I ran into with this unit, and that is using it in the other position. It explains and has rubber feet so you can stand it up so that the air is drawn in from the top, but after using it that way for a month, the fans seemed to be wearing out (making noise and not running as fast). I switch it back to the position it was in and it seems to be running fine for now. Personally I would suggest placing the unit in the position shown in the picture rather than the other way to keep it from giving you problems."
2,Didn't Last,Bought this to use while a house guest with breathing problems stayed with us for a few months. It worked pretty well for that time and we were happy with the purchase. However after a few months the change filter light came on & stayed on even after several cleanings & we had been keeping up on cleanings before this point. There is a warning with it that if it runs while dirty it becomes a fire hazard so we had to toss it out not knowing if it was just a defective light or not. We smoke & my guess is it became gummed up internally & the white color was also not smoking friendly as it quickly became discolored so I can't recommend this for smoking homes. I like the idea of a home air purifier & will probably purchase a heavier duty model in the future but for now we just decided to keep the smoke outdoors.
4,"Quiet, compact air purifier","Great little purifier. I leave it on just about 24/7. It's small-ish, fits on a desk, and is moderately quiet. Recommended."
2,very loud,I purchased this for a bedroom. I am very dissapointed in how loud it is. The fan on low sounds like a big powerful box fan on high. So you can imagine how loud this purifier is on high! I saw where a lot of people commented on how quiet it is and I think they need their hearing checked lol.
4,took care of allergies-but very loud,"My wife has various allergies and before bed,it was a miserable time for her with sneezes,etc.I got her one of these air purifiers and in only a few days,the allergy symptoms disappeared. These are very effective at cleaning the air.The only drawback is that they are rather loud;so much so that we both turn the unit on ""high"" as soon as we get home from work and leave them on w/ the door closed until bed-time. So,be warned,they are good and inexpensive air purifiers,but are pretty loud. Some may have no problem w/ leaving them on at night but that didn't work for us.If not for their loudness,I'd give them five stars."
3,Fan / Air Cleaner,"Just 3 Stars, I can't really tell if the ionizer works? Fan and Air Circulation gets the 3 Stars, Not 5 cause the filtration/Ionizer is hard to know how well it really is doing? But for the price and dust filtering it could get 4 Stars."
2,not so good,The sound is too noise.I just need to turn on when no body in the room.When we sleep i must turn it off.
3,It's okay,"I bought two air purifiers on Amazon over a year ago. This one is still working, can't say the same for the other. We keep it above the refrigerator to suck up strong cooking smells and foul odors that come in from our downstairs neighbors who must cook with eye of newt and poop of cat. Yech! It's quiet in the lowest mode but is pretty loud when it's on high. I have a sensitive nose and hate waking up to the smell of last night's dinner so sometimes we keep it on all night and it clean all of the air. I wouldn't recommend this for a bedroom unless the sound of a fan doesn't bother you."
4,could have been worse,"i didn't notice any change at all for the first couple days, but once it got everything out of the air i started to notice a change. i did have to the door closed to the room it was in and the room was smaller than what it said it could handle. i wouldn't use it on a room any bigger that what it is ment for.worked great in a closet to take the musty smell out of my marching uniform though"
1,poor quality,"I had this unit for only a week and the two lower settings for the fan stopped working, even on high the fan would barely move. The front cover for the filter would also vibrate and make a loud rattle."
2,Loud!,"I may be more sensitive than average, but this one definitely keeps me awake even with the lowest setting. I cannot read, concentrate, play (acoustic) music or sleep. I wonder how people can ever keep this ON while in the same room, which is meant to be small. Since I invested already, I decided to keep running loudly while I'm off to work and turn it off in the evening. To give you some idea how loud this is when it is at the lowest setting, it sounds like a work-horse (say 2.5-3 GHz) tower computer with cheep (e.g, ones that come with the pre-built desktop without upgrade) fan(s). I can hear this running from the other end of my flat condo of 800 sqft with mid to high setting."
4,Overall Good Product & Value,"I am overall happy with the unit. It is a great size and is easy to work. It works very well for being so small.But as other reviewers have noted, it is a little on the loud side when operating. There are three fans speeds. On the lowest setting it is as loud as a regular desk fan on its highest setting. On the other two higher settings the sound is about as loud as the high setting on the exhaust fan above your stove. However, if you plan on using it only when needed or at night, like I do, it works just fine. In fact, the white noise it makes helps me sleep at night."
2,Noisy,"These units are truly small and very noisy. I purchased 4 of them for small rooms in my home. It does an 'ok' job for the price but I am thinking I should have gone with a larger, less noisy unit."
3,Honeywell HHT-011 Compact Air Purifier with Permanent HEPA Filter,Is a good product wish it was a little quieter. It does a goood job improving the Air Quality here in my room in Afghanistan.SFC Eshleman
1,Extremely NOISY,"Very high pitched noise at all speeds, sounds like a 747 taxying in a runway they should use this product instead of waterboarding."
3,Noisy,"I suppose ""quiet"" is a relative term, but I don't think this air filter is quiet at all, I find it to be quite loud, actually. I normally like to sleep with some white noise, but this thing is very high-pitched and has a slight rattling sound. I often turn it off at night because it keeps me awake, which sort of defeats the purpose, I guess..."
2,Airflow,"Doesn't really do much, I don't really believe this is actually making the air cleaner in my room but I bought it for piece of mind."
2,Short life span,"Worked great. For a whole 6 months - then it died. Must have gotten a lemon. I could return it, but between the postage expense and the required fee to the company, it just isn't worth it."
1,Lasted less than two months before fan started rattling...,"After a month the fan started rattling loudly on high, as if the bearings were worn out or something was misaligned. Then a while later it started on medium. Now it sometimes rattles on low.There are enough complains similar to mine that there is clearly a design or quality control issue there."
3,Nice looking but...,"Nice looking but awfully loud. I bought this thinking it would not sound like a regular fan but I was way off...haha. this thing is really loud even on low. Buy with caution, especially if you want quiet."
2,Over rated,"I bought this book with high expectations of acquiring details on the new economy where e is for everything. However, I was disappointed because there was no depth. If the author can use the framework of the book and rewrite another version with more meat in it, I think it will become a great book. Like I said, put more meat and research into this book, a waste to let the current book go to waste."
5,One of my favorite Transformers.,A solid well put together design. A little more durable then other since is simple to transform. Well proportion. Nice casting looks great. A couple of clip on pieces like his head-wing. The arm kind of stick out when in truck mode. The latter works and you can switch his hand with a missile that doesn&#65533;t shoot. Inferno was Red-Alert buddy and I have them both. He is little taller then the other Autobot cars.
5,I'm know for my rendition of the song with the chickens.,"If you like fairy tales you'll love this. It's full of kid friendly songs and moral lessons. I'm personally well known within my family unit for my rendition of the ""thumbelina"" song. I've pretty much got the chicken, bull, and goat voices down pat. I was my mother's ring tone for a while. . . but anyway. . . this is a sweet movie about love conquering all, and spanish frogs. Enjoy."
5,A Classic that's not a Disney & still great!,"This was my daughters (now 20) favorite movie growing up, and admittedly one of mine. So to find this on DVD was a HUGE treat, and was a HUGE hit as she got it for her 20th birthday. All her movies started on VHS and we are slowly trying to transition the collection of over 150 to DVD. Mostly Walt Disney films but this was a favorite and not a Disney. The DVD was new, and the movie was as we remembered from years ago. Service of the seller was exceptional and I cannot state enough how happy I was to find this movie in 'NEW' condition."
4,Good movie,Growning up in the 90s you will never forget the movies you would watch in elementary school. Kids should enjoy this movie becuase it is how animation was originally created without the use of CGI
1,Horrible character,"I am a huge fan of animation and watch one movie weekly w/ my 4 children. This would have to be the worst film I have seen w/ them. Although the animation itself is good, the plot and storyline are horrible and truly boring. To add insult, the title character of Thumbelina is made to be a weak, sniveling, pathetic excuse of a girl. Throughout the film, my daughters and I came up with ways that Thumbelina could get herself out of the situation if she would just think about it. Furthermore, although she is put into bad situations over and over again, only once does she actually have the gumption to say ""NO"". Very annoying. We will be ""losing"" this film ASAP as this is not a character I want my children modeling themselves after. I just kept hoping that Thumbelina would develop some spunk and some chutzpah."
1,Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!,"I bought this movie because I love the story of Thumbelina and it had good reviews. I don't understand how this got any positive reviews. We have a 4 year old, twin 3 year olds, a 2 year old, and a 1 year old. This movie cannot hold their attention for even 5 minutes. I understand why the boys hate it, but even the 3 year old girl will not watch it. We have tried several times to watch this with them for family movie night and they all just run away. I don't blame them. The plot drags on and is odd. The characters are annoying. The only thing redeeming about the movie is that some of the Barry Manilow songs are o-kay."
5,"Fantastic songs, Great Animation","My little girl is 2 1/2 and wonn't let me turn this video off - the songs are great (very catchy) and the animation is fab - Thumbelina's face pulls some lovely expressions. It's also a lot less sugary than Disney so won't put the adults off after the 100th viewing. Yes, she is a bit of a wimp, but she's a princess-to-be so who cares! If you don't think the Beetle Ball is fun then you have no child in you! Buy it now!"
2,It's like a whole T.V. serise combined into 90 minutes.,"Dude, Don Bluth. What happened to you man? Why do you insist on telling stories that are just too long and too confusing to be movies? Watching this movie was like watching a million plots combined into one. It seemed like every two seconds Thumbalina would wake up in another stranger's home voiced by yet another celebrity. This movie does get some points for some nice CGI action and good music. Can't recomend this one. It's just too much and not enough at the same time."
1,Pathetic!,"My children received this movie as a gift, and I wish they hadn't. Thumbelina is a WEENIE! She is constantly at the mercy of everyone else, and doesn't appear to have a brain of her own. I realize that she is very small, but she just goes along with whatever the other characters want her to do, even to the point of getting married! She is NOT a strong female character, nor a good example for our daughters, or sons for that matter. I would not recommend this movie at all."
5,An unusual story about a healing bond,"It's been a year since Ben's mother died, but he misses her daily. His only consolation is his love for elephants, which his mother loved too - his involvement in the life of a special elephant who has been a survivor brings a bond to both which can heal in this unusual story."
4,Nearly Great,"There is no doubt that James Forbes is a superb preacher but this is not a superb video. The editors have made odd cuts to the sermon. The full text is supplied in printed form but it is odd that they have Dr Forbes reading the scripture lesson (which everyone can access) and edit out parts of the sermon delivered.Surely, though, it is great to have this record of a fine preacher and communicator. It is well worth seeing."
1,CAUTION,"At the bottom of page 2 of Pacific Fighter's User Manual appears the following:""NOTICE: This game contains technology intended to prevent copying that may conflict with some CD-RW, DVD-RW, and virtual drives.""BELIEVE IT!!!I'm running a Pent IV with a 3.00GHz processor (XP) and DVD/CD writer combo and have spent days trying to load the Gold Pack and Pacific Fighters. After loading, my odds of getting the game to actually come up are about 1 in 10 and it takes a minimum of ten minutes with each try. I wasted my time and money. I can't even play it as a stand-alone game. I'll find some other software to use with my CH Fighter Stick or it will be a waste as well."
3,Great price.,"I purchased to replace my work pants. The price was great, I could not find anything on-line or in local stores close to the price. They fit good and look fine, but the material does not have as nice a feel to them as the Dockers Signature Khaki D4."
2,amuzing,"The fight between Nancy and Tonya was awesome. But watch for awesome and nice performances from other famous skaters BAuil, Petrenko, torvil and Dean etc."
1,riddled with errors,"McGraw-Hill's 2005 LSAT book advice is interesting but insufficient. It is a good starting point for folks who have many months to study. It offers very simple strategies to tackle the most basic problems. However, it does not sufficiently prepare you for any more complicated LSAT questions.The largest problem with this book is the practice tests are riddled with errors. In one section of a practice test I counted 11 different obvious mistakes which would lead a test taker to select an answer that would be correct, but would be marked as incorrect by the answer sheet. As a result, the book does not offer test takers an accurate assessment of their ability to perform on the test, and is likely to instigate false insecurities."
1,Don't Buy This Book,"As mentioned in the other reviews, this book is littered with errors.It is very frustrating to spend long periods of time on problems that you feel you aren't understanding, only to find out later that the question itself is wrong!!My personal suggestion is to buy a different study guide and purchase actual previous LSAT exams to practice for time."
2,"Sure, the answer keys are useless and confusing, but the general advice is helpful","It is true that the answer keys in this book suck, making it impossible to ever really know if you are getting the sample questions correct. Obviously, that is a huge problem.However, this is the only general book I found that assumes the user is relatively bright, and some of the tricks and suggestions were relatively unique and definitely helpful. Also, the inclusion of 6 practice tests is really nice.So, yeah, this book sucks because of the answer key issue. But once they get that sorted out (maybe in the next addition one would hope), I think this book is going to be awesome."
4,Hardfloor does jazz!!!,"This CD starts out a lovely, bop-able jazz with that signature Hardfloor style (they produced a single by the name Da Damn Freak Noize Funk during their regular career; this is a pseudonym project), then moves into techno territory with stops along the way in the realms of hip hop and drum and bass. A nice sampler of styles, all with the precision and rollicking fun of Hardfloor."
5,Amazing,"This chap is amazing. A must read book, you will be unable to put it down.The DIY part is immensely helpful. The next best thing to seeing him live on Granada Breeze."
4,Just enough.,"This is just the right stroller for two kids. It moves easily and maneuvers really well. The only thing I wish that was already attached are the cupholders, which I purchased separately."
2,Boring and useless,"I bought this one after reading ""Astrologically Incorrect for Lover's"" expecting it to be as good or at least as funny. Unfortunately it is not. I had a good laugh at the Aries section with my Aries friend as it was very accurate but it provided no more information than I've seen elsewhere. The other signs fall flat in this book as the author tends to dwell on only one characteristic of each sign. The title of this makes it sound like a much more stimulating read than it actually is. The follow-up ""...for Lover's"" is much better. I would also recommend the ""Darkside Zodiac"" as it is more interesting and very funny."
2,Not worth it...,Tons of generalizations...and it's not nearly as funny or insightful as other astrological books I've read.
5,Pretty damn good...,"Truly shredding power that sg's music brings to the table. I assume you already own sg's sewn mouth secrets...If not ? You are a waste of space! Amazing music,production,&,lirycs.Worth it!"
1,don't even think about it!,"The day I bought this cd I almost threw it away! No words to say how disappointing this band is,tedious,scarce and intollerable are the only ones I have.They play a sort of death-grind metal with a couple of blues influences:the idea might be good..If you like the genre like me ,try Criptopsy or broken hope."
4,Engaging Dialog,"I found this movie to be very erotic. My biggest letdown was the failure to develop the character of Tara (Actress Alexis Zibolis). I kept expecting she would be a key player in the deception. She is smoking hot. She talks about what a freak she can be, but never actually does anything but talk. Despite my disappointment, I give this flick a solid 4 star rating."
2,Not a good film,"The story is complicated with twists and turns which, however, are unconvincing.The writer of the story and the director appear to have got themselves into a mess of twisted knots, with no way out.They try to give a surprise ending, but it is very unconvincing."
2,Just ok,"Sound quality was just fine, but this one is very handy and takes less space and an easy choice for travel."
4,Value for the money,"I purchased two pairs of these headphones for some lengthy air travel. They were comfortable and the controls were easy to use. They folded compactly. The sound, on my laptop and over the airplane sound system, was decent.As for noise reduction, were they as good as the latest model (QuietComfort 3, for $350) from Bose? No way. Were they close? No way. But for less than one-tenth the price, they provided some genuine noise reduction.Are these the best under $50 noise-reduction headphones? I don't know. But for those of us in the cheap seats, they provided a significant improvement over regular headphones or the airplane earpieces at an affordable price."
2,Ok headphones but...,"I bought these to specifically block outside sounds and I hardly notice a difference when the noise canceling is activated or not. This is the first pair of noise canceling headphones I have ever tried so maybe I am expecting too much from them. I want them to block noise in a library environment, mostly voices, books thumping, and chairs scraping. Maybe noise doesn't work in environments such as this but for the price you can buy better, slimmer headphones."
2,"Good Headphones, Bad Noise Cancellation","Pro:Good Sound Quality, good cord length.Con:Nonexistent noise cancellation, poor folding design.I had a pair of folding JVC sound canceling headphones from 2003, that worked great, but were stolen when my car was ripped off. being that the sound cancellation was excellent and the folding design worked great, I figured I would get another pair. well, times change, and I guess for the worst. the folding design is poor, and does not make the headphones as compac as they could be. the sound cancellation is barely noticeable, and may as well not be used. the old pair I had worked great, I do not know how newer can result in poorer."
5,Excellent Headphones,These headphones are definitely worth it. They cancel ambient noise very well and the stereo sound is amazing. Definitely worth the money and I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a nice pair of headphones for travel or home but does not want to spend $500 on a pair of Bose.
2,not good,I've owned several of these kinds of headphones. JVC has the least actual noise cancellation of any. Good sound quality otherwise. The plastic broke after four months.... Not worth it.
3,Mutter and Karajan,"Sophie-Anne Mutter is no doubt one of the great violinist. So is Yo-yo Ma, the cellist. And Karajan is no doubt one of the greatest conductor ever. Given that, this CD is not up to expectation.One reason is that the violin concerto is her debut performance with the Berliner Philharmoniker back to the 80s. In that performance, her technique was exceptionally good. However, I think she overused the vibration technique and lack a more deep feeling.The triple concerto, with the participation of Yoyo Ma, is below expectation. The orchestra is out performed the soloits so that it becomes dominant. For a concerto, I think the soloists must be at the center. Here, the orchestra is considerably louder than the violin and the cello. Maybe, it dues to sound recording.But over all, it is a good CD, two for the price of one."
4,Purchased as a text book,"A comprehensive look at the subject. Purchased as a text and meet the needs of the class. Its been a while since I used it, but as I remember it was a fairly easy read for what it is."
2,Not in the condition stated,"It was not in the condition that it was said to be in and it took a long time to ship it! The pages were bent and crinkled and the cover was all scuffed up and stained. Not what I consider to be in ""very good condition"". I was dissapointed with this seller."
3,Should of checked into the Chick,"I was really sold on this book by the reviews and I was disappointed because I thought she might have calories, fat, and protein numbers posted for each recipe. Sadly, I did not take into consideration that the author is writing to the general public and not those who are improving their physique. Overall, this is a great book for those struggling to make someone more than fried chicken. I highly recommend this for others but for fitness buffs, I suggest to steer clear of this one."
4,Good Book For Couples,"I've always liked 'Chicken Soup' books, and this one is one of my favorites. There are many stories in the book, each written by a different author sharing his or her own inspirational experience. Because each story is written by a different author, they each have their own distinct characteristics. I really enjoyed the story about an elderly lady who lost her husband and received long-stemmed roses from him for Valentine's Day after his passing. That story, along with many others in this collection, will help to ease any doubt for those who may believe true love is out of reach. I also highly recommend 'Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Little Book of Wisdom' by Taro Gold."
5,A must for newly married couples,My husband and I received this book as a wedding gift. I read it on the plane to our honeymoon destination. I shared some of the stories with my husband and we both agreed that it added a very special touch to our whole wedding experience. I felt inspired by the stories and moved to tears over a few. I recommend this book as a gift to all newly married couples.
4,This book is good,This book is good but it was not what I expected. I really thought it would make me cry like I have read other chicken soup books but this one did not seem too sentimental but good book
3,spindle pack...why why why,considering how much you pay for 4 disks with no real extras (or an english dub) why the cheap spindle pack?????????
4,Interesting,Had to read this book for a class in grad school. It provided interesting insight into Goldberger but the tone of the author wasn't very objective
1,No Star Review,"This game is terrible. For one thing it does not even come with a reference book for installing and installing issues. I like some of the other consummers purchased this game in good faith thinking that a computer less than a year old with a high end video card (when purchased) would be able to run it. BUT after installing it and uninstalling it and then installing it again, and after making the upgrade as suggested for their video links this game still would not run. Even after going to UBI's support page and doing all of the suggested fixes still no GAME PLAYING!So, I then went to my final resouce and called UBI in person and there I was told that the game would not work on a less than a year old video card and that I was pretty much of of the $40 spent on this nothing game. So in my words UBI is making money while we are lossing!!! Thanks, but no more games from your company UBI!"
4,So your having CD-RW Issues eh...,"If your reading this, scan down and read about the person who blames this game and the company who made it because of CD-RW issues, and because it won't start up at all. I have a tip for that person. Read the ""Readme files"", most games don't run good or run at all on CD-RW drives, which are ""CD burner"" disk drives. da... That's why your game is not wanting to load. The game like most PC games only run on CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drives. Always read the ""Readme Files"" Any game with Tom Clancy's name on it, believe me it has been tested to work on Windows 98, me, 2000, XP and on quite a bit of hardware too.I just bought this game and have not really finished it yet. So I don't know how good it is all the way through..."
4,Great Game But...,"This is a great game to play, no doubt. Unlike in the fisrt game, you can knock dudes out without killing them. Make sure to check the system requierments and comfirm they are up to par. I had to upgrade my video card in order to play, but it was definitly worth it."
5,Great Product,"I just received my Sirius S50 radio but it didn't come with the belt clip to be used with my armband. Because my purchase from Sirius was a refurb, I figured I'd just search for a product that would be a welcomed replacement. I did and it was priced right. I'm quite satisfied with my purchase although the rubber seems a bit cheezy."
2,Bird-proof feeder,"I bought this feeder as a replacement for another feeder. I believe it would indeed deter squirrels but, as some other reviewers have said, birds may not be able to figure out how to get the to the seed. I've only had mine up a week but I plan to get something else as I'm afraid the birds will go elsewhere. Also, I didn't realize that birds like cardinals would be too large to use this feeder."
4,Awesome Picker,"Don't think I have ever heard any thing like Tommy Emmanuel. When you watch his fingers flow like ribbons you will know what I mean. He doesn't just play music, he is music."
4,Great Guitar player,Tommy's guitar playing will blow your mind. If you ever get the chance to see him live...take it. This DVD was different because of the vocals.
2,too much singing!! the Mel Bay DVD is far superior...IMHO,I love Tommy Emmanuel..but the previously released DVD in concert is much more to my liking...Tommy playing his great repetoire of standards and originals like nobody else in the world! This DVD has him singing too many songs and a guest female vocalist on at least 4 numbers....I allmost feel its misleading to not have her name on the front of the DVD!There are many better singers in the world...few better guitarists...stop singing and play!
4,Touching but a bit slow..,"Love, Greg & Lauren is a touching story of a woman who remarkably heals after being burned on over 82% of her body on 9/11. Through her healing process Greg, her husband, talks about her day to day recovery and how all those around Lauren were counting on her to help heal those who lost loved ones.It's a slow starting book, but in the end you'll be glad you finished it."
2,Seemed a bit superficial at times,"I believe that Greg loves Lauren, but I was a little annoyed when he seemed to care more for the fact that her lovely blonde hair was ""charred"" and then when he was able to see her face, that her ""perfect teeth"" were still there. THIS WOMAN SURVIVED A TERRIBLE ORDEAL and he's acting woeful about her looks.I liked the first hand account of their story, but was put out by some of the superficiality of it. There is more to life than losing your beauty. In fact, the fact that she survived makes her even more beautiful...Maybe I just read it wrong, but that bothered me."
4,Time Well Spent,"I remembered this book from when I was a child. I ordered it for my two children, ages 6 and 4. It has become a favorite on a cold Winter evening. We read about Owl and then we made split pea soup to eat (like Owl, who loves pea soup)."
2,decent smell but nobody can smell it :(,"The smell of this perfume is really good. But the problem if even if spray it around 10-15 times, nobody can smell it. What kind of perfume is it, after u spray nobody can even smell it. Really bad. Feel like 35 bucks have been wasted."
2,Can't handle the smell,"The consistency of this ointment is great, but we couldn't take the scent of it. Very overpowering. We stopped using the product after three days."
5,DONELL JONES IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE R&B SINGERS,"THIS ALBUM IS SOOOOOOO GOOD. I REALLY LIKED HIS FIRST ALBUM TOO, ""MY HEART."" MY FAVORITE SONGS FROM THIS ALBUM ARE ""U KNOW WHAT'S UP"" ""SHORTY (GOT HER EYES ON ME)"" ""WHERE I WANNA BE"" ""ALL THIS LUV"" ""PUSHIN"" ""WHEN I WAS DOWN"" AND ""HE WON'T HURT YOU."" ----I CAN LISTEN TO THIS WHOLE ALBUM STRAIGHT THROUGH BUT, THOSE ARE THE SONGS THAT CAUGHT MY EARS FROM THE FIRST LISTEN.-----THIS ALBUM IS A MUST HAVE IN ANY R&B COLLECTION.----I AM ALSO A FAN OF HIS THIRD ALBUM ""LIFE GOES ON."" Please check out his fourth album ""Journey of a Gemini."" Very impressive!"
4,weird but fabulous,"i really love laura kinsale. she is a sophisticated writer who leaves so much to the reader's imagination that you actually have to work a little bit for the reward. she refuses to spoon-feed her readers every feeling and every thought. truly rare in this genre. i will concede that the ending is a bit of a confused mess, but i managed to forgive it because of how well kinsale sold the first 300-odd pages. i highly recommend this, and all of kinsale's books. she is amazing."
4,Well done if you accept the Magic premise,"I love this writer's characters, but feel her abilities were squandered by bringing in magic. Anyone can write interesting stories with fairies and ESP- but she can do what others cant: make believable, balanced, interesting characters interact well. What do you need magic for? I had to read ""Flowers from the Storm"" three times in a row. This one has some good rereadable parts, but... Now, having said that, I would certainly recommend this book! She's great!"
2,Utterly Strange,"This book was one of my least favorite books I've ever read.I mean, maybe it's just because I'm not used to something so dark and mysterious as this, but I just felt the Kinsale was just dragging the story on for about 100 pages.This story was so very like a fantasy, that I'm wondering if the category should indeed be fantasy.The only thing this book is missing is a field of Unicorns, and some leprechauns.Any way, maybe it's just because I'm too ""immature"" to enjoy a piece as this, but I don't recommend it to people who are into the classic love story, or lightheartedness.If you're into this sort of stuff, read on.I just didn't enjoy it at all."
5,Asch's Nazarene,"A remarkable achievement, Asch is faithful to both the Jewish Bible and New Testament sources. Of particular note, in my mind, is his treatment of the dynamic between the Pharisees and Sadducees, the infidelity and corruption of the latter, and the corrective of putting the Pharisaic tradition in its proper light, as the child of the great Hillel, the teachings of whom very often are found in Jesus' own. For Christians and Jews alike, this book is the best of its genre. (For a modern discussion of Jesus' roots in the Pharisaic tradition, see Susannah Heschel's Abraham Geiger and the Jewish Jesus and also her The Aryan Jesus: Christian Theologians and the Bible in Nazi Germany.)"
4,Long search,I was glad to have found this movie here. I have the movie on VHS and was surprised to have found it on dvd. I was very please with the price of it as well.
4,Devito Classic,"This is one of Danny DeVito best movies ever, it just shows you can put him in any style comedy movie and it will be funny. This and Major Payne are to very funny movies that have a military theme to them. So if you have enjoyed any movie with DeVito in it but have not seen this yet I suggest you see it"
4,Above average and more sensible than you think,"Yes, there really are English teachers in the Army. My sister-in-law was a civilian hired to improve the writing and reading of GIs who needed extra help. This is a very funny movie and Danny Devito makes it worth watching. It takes the right teacher to make Shakespeare worth reading. I'd have paid a lot more attention in English class if I had a teacher like him!"
4,Inspiring for educators and parents,"This movie was nearly as good as ""Dead Poets Society."" I am glad to be inspired by another movie that shows how effective education can be. Danny DeVito touched my heart as he turned ""illiterate"" soldiers on to great literature in a down-to-earth way, surrounded by the rigid military protocol.I also enjoyed the story of the father/daughter relationship in which the father wakes up to his daughter's beauty, and comes around to support her individuality."
5,I Love this Movie!,I love this movie starring Danny DeVito as a man who takes a job teaching remedial English on a military base because he can't find any other job. My favorite part is when Danny DeVito teaches them Shakespeare. This is a heart-warming story with good performances.
2,Brian Eno Influnced and Brian Eno Ruined,Artists continue to flock to Brian Eno to produce and co-write their albums. And again Brian Eno doesn't disappoint - he ruins another album with the same old tired techno sound.
2,fuzzy-headed new-age spirituality,"I'm a huge Paul Simon fan. Hated this record.This is basically a spiritual/religious record. In the past, I've enjoyed Simon's satire-flavored take on religion in ""Duncan,"" and was able to enjoy an occasional less tongue-in-cheek approach on tracks like ""Mother and Child Reunion,"" the folk song ""Go Tell it on the Mountain,"" and ""Long, Long Day."" But in a concentrated dose like this, it just makes me gag. There's only so much treacle you can take."
2,Not so good,"Paul Simon is a very skilled songwriter who has done some remarkable work. ""Bookends"" and ""Graceland"" were brilliant, and a number of other songs are classics. But he is also terribly concerned with proving to people how serious he is, and how clever he is, and demonstrating how he can write just about any kind of pop song imaginable. And this can get very, very tiresome, as it does in this album. If there were great tunes here it would be one thing, but there really aren't any here. And lyrically it is extremely overdone. What does he mean by ""I registered to vote today"" in ""Sure Don't Feel Like Love""? Listen to the lyrics in that song and you'll realize there's nothing there-just a series of semi-clever phrases strung together. It's second-rate stream of conscousness writing posing as ""poetry"", something that seems to afflict many older songwriters. It's too bad, because Simon has been really good at times; he just thinks he's much better than he is."
4,"""Eno-esque"" Simon...but it's still Simon","Rather than go ""song by song"" as is often done in this forum, I will quickly address the merits of this album: Simon's historically bemused, ironic and clever take on the world is intact, as is his gift for the catchy riff. The Brian Eno influence is alternatingly enhancing and annoying-- I mean, really-- Paul Simon has one of the purest voices in popular music-- was there really a need to make portions of this disc sound like ""Achtung Baby Lite""? Having said that, Simon wisely let Eno in the house (which works very well on ""Outrageous"", the most infectious song on the disc)...but didn't let him stay over! Smart people who've lost touch with Simon since Graceland/Rhythm of the Saints will be well served to buy this along with ""You're The One"", which is easily Simon's most underrated work."
2,Don't Like Surprises??,It was decades ago when Dylan went electric and inspired the wrath and outrage of the senseless masses. It isn't surprising that Surprise has so many 1-star and 5-star ratings; it's that polarizing with Eno's influence doing no favors to some well crafted lyrics. My guess is that if Simon had been more prolific in recent years Surprise may have ended up just a blip in his portfolio but the wait and the label's hype make this release more disappointing. Tom Waits won't be losing any sleep over the title of greatest American song writer.
4,Eclectic and Soulful,"I may be making too much out of Brian Eno's contributions here, but this CD does not sound like ""my father's"" Paul Simon. I'm hearing this dark and tuneful voice singing about things I don't recall multi-mega millionaire superstar singers singing about. And I'm hearing clever, jumpy and at times very funky electronic instrumentation. And I'm hearing a flat-out rocking, kick arse break at the end of ""How Can You Live In The Northeast"". And are those sleigh bells towards the end of ""Outrageous""? That small caress of (uh oh, here's that word) ""sonic"" goodness? Maybe I've just never ""gotten"" Simon before. I do recall ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" and ""The Boxer"" having these very dense and clever arrangments. In fact, those were probably the first ""pop"" songs I recall ever liking. So maybe Simon's ""leap"" to Eno-ism is not that foreign a venture. I can see, though, how it could be foreign to people who think of Simon in ""older"" terms, but the music must change. Musn't it?"
4,Skip ahead of the beginning sounds for little ones,"I purchased this cd for my 5 year old Grandson, who is afraid of the dark. My daughter has to listen to the beginning first before giving him the headphones because it starts out with a scary loud chime and animal sounds that frightened my Grandson. He does enjoy the story. For a cd that is supposed to assist with children's bedtime fears I'm surprised that it starts out with eerie sounds. BUT, I gave it a rating of I LIKE IT because, once the story starts he enjoys listening to it."
5,finally a pair of sneaks I can wear,I have M.S. & my walking is unsteady at best so xtra wide sneakers that I can tighten to stay on my feet is a real plus
5,A must read for anyone interested in the Middle East.,Riveting book that tells a story that goes far beyond the straight forward facts of the events of the Rabin assassination. It is the trenchant story of how extreme religiousity and extreme nationalism blend into a murderous brew that puts the right wing of Israel above the law and the national pursuit of and interest in a negotiated peace with the Arabs. This book is a must read for - and a clear warning to - anyone with a nostalgic sympathy for the religious community of Israel. The extreme religious right of Isael is centered on an absolute belief in the corectness of their path - and it grants no legitimacy to any other political views. In such a community murder becomes a righteous act rather than the most heinous of criminal offenses. This is a well written and outstanding contribution to understanding the the complex political and religious society of Israel.

1,All-time nadir of Blondie's career,"You know those albums that dissapoint you upon first listen,the ones you carefully file away and pull out years later onlyto find that they're actually really swell? The albums thatgrow in value over the years, and force you to wonder whatwas wrong with you when you dismissed them in the first place?Well, this is not one of those albums. Worse by an orderof magnitude than ANY other original album in the Blondiecatalogue. Reissued to hook fools and completists only.dap"
1,Mine is broke...,"It's stick to the pool and can't move unless turn off the pomp. So I try to move after get stuck and it broke. It's my pomp to strong? 1hp, I doubt.So I could not use and I don't know how anybody could used because will stick to the bottom of the pool. Maybe you could used on the walls only..."
2,Low Quality,It works well vacuums up bottom of my pool well so for that reason I gave it a 2. I have used it only twice and I noticed there is a small crack which appears to be inside the blue plastic area. I have not abused it or dropped it so I believe it is a defect in the plastic. For the price I guess I can't expect a high quality item. I am sure it is made in China like about everything else anymore. Good old American made high quality items are a thing of the past.
2,I have better luck with my home-made tool than this one.,"I used a piece of PVC and I cut a piece of ""pool vacuum hose"" and clamped it to the end of the pvc. Then I cut a V shaped slit in the pool hose, wide at the mouth, narrow at the clamp, slit face down toward the bottom of the pool when in use. This contraption I made does a better job than the liner vacuum I purchased, which seems to have too much surface area for the puny pump that comes with the temporary summer pool I used it on. -- which I realize is most of the problem and with a real pump and filter the results would likely have been MUCH better."
4,"Just like in the store, but cheaper","You've seen this in every pool store or hardware store that sells pool products. I like the rotating cuff too. If your hose doesn't have one (rotating cuff), this 360-degree cuff will eliminate kinks so your hose won't wrap up onto itself. Works great, looks great.Only problem I can determine is the weight of it. With using longer pool hoses/poles, or in deeper pools it's difficult to determine if it's actually flat on the bottom of the pool because it's so light weight. Even in my 4.5' deep pool, if I try to vaccume too fast, it will lift off the bottom. To get the proper suction when vacuming it needs to sit flat on the pool bottom.They should find a way to add a bit of weight to this product and it would be perfect."
5,classic!!,"This scent has been around a long time, its light, long lasting when applied, scents the skin and leaves it soft. Not as drying, alcohol content small. Good moisturizer in the winter. Love it!!"
2,"Unfortunately, Some Didn't Work","I bought this for the hallway but only one of the three I bought worked properly. Unfortunately, the electrician took so long to make the appointment and to do the work I was unable to return them to the seller in a timely fashion. So, I'm out of pocket with this product."
4,Quite satisfied with TvMicro,"We're redoing an office/den in our vacation home and needed a new TV (seldom used in this room). Space is at a bit of a premium so didn't want more than 26"". Unexpectedly ended up buying a new Mac computer with a 20"" screen, and was pleased to find out that there is a way to get TV through the computer. Took a chance on the TvMicro and we're quite pleased with the result. It will never rival a good HDTV, but for our purposes it's absolutely fine.Miglia TVMicroFor about $50 we've accomplished our goal and saved a lot of space. Easy to install, and it even has a remote control. The transaction with ANTONLINE went very well."
1,Do not buy this item!!!,"I purchased the Miglia TVMicro a month ago. The software used to operate the device is 3rd party and requires a code for activation. I entered the code provided to me, and received a message stating my code is invalid/out of date. I have contacted Miglia by email (there is no phone number available to call) several times to get a valid activation code, and no response whatsoever. My only options without a code is to return the TVMicro or buy a new license for the software at $40.00."
4,Wonderful Device!,"This USB Tuner does exactly what it should do and does it well. Switching channels is very, very fast. Although it does run quite hot, it hasn't been a problem.Combined with EyeTV 3, this is the best PVR solution I could find for such a price."
4,Interesting - A different perspective,An interesting read. I wouldn't agree with some of the predicted technological developements (an easy sex change? - a little too PC) but I still enjoyed the exercise. The 'real' entries were a good review of history. I actually learned a little Chinese history too - enough to make me want to learn more.
3,Description is incorrect.,I ordered 830656 specifically because it stated that it came with a leather sheath. It does not. Ordered as a christmas gift and very disappointed when it arrived. Don't have time to return it for another leatherman with leather sheath.
2,Difficult operation,"Very Very difficult to open and close, Almost creating a nip point posing a hazard, I amconcidering returning it for another"
4,Great movie for the family,"Cheaper by the Dozen, hits the tickle bones of children of all ages, and even adults. This movie is perfect for the family to watch togather.PLUS Hilary Duff actually is good in here, maybe its because she finally dosnt act so "" Lizzie McGuire-ish"" all the tripping for example in all of her other movies and on her show."
2,"Mildly entertaining, but misses the moral of the book","The movie is fairly clean and mildly entertaining, but it misses the whole point of the book. If you're looking for a clean, mildly entertaining movie, this works fine, but if you're looking for something with a good set of values and morals, this didn't cut it for me."
2,Not even that many laughs,"Waste of talent, insult to parents who can cope, and just plain bothersome. You might stay awake for the first hour, but then it gets embarassing. So give into your urges and take a nap. Remember Clifton Webb."
1,12 Reasons For a Vasectomy,"I knew going in that this film got poor reviews. It should have had a warning label regarding bad taste, poor parenting, and rude behavior. This is alleged to be a ""family"" when in fact it was a collection of lazy, self-absorbed, monsters that should have been put in burlap bags and left on the door step of an evil witch. The parents were completely ineffective and clueless on how to raise children much less organize such a large household.This is the typical Hollywood view of families -- that is a family composed of loud mouthed rude children with a quick response to totally goofy parents. Not one child uttered one believable line in the entire movie. If ever a film warranted asking for your money back this one is it."
1,Please Make It Stop,"This rates as possibly the very worst film I have ever seen. Non-stop cliched gross-out gags made me want to poke my eyes out within five minutes. The movie basically only sent the message that if kids are bratty enough, they can manipulate their parents into doing anything.The characters, unfortunately even including the father played by Steve Martin, were entirely one-dimensional and totally unendearing. I only wish that I could rate this a fraction of a star on this review scale.If you really want your kids to come away with impressions of family values or moral lessons, check out Pollyanna (Hayley Mills) or the Anne of Green Gables series. Something like The Music Man, either the Robert Preston or Matthew Broderick version, would be more fun and less mind-numbing for any audience than this. Save your money, time, and brain cells by giving this one a wide pass."
3,"Dirty ""Dozen""","Sappy, sitcomish remake to the 1950 original that has a few genuine laughs but a decent enough movie to fold laundry to.Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt star as parents to 12 kids who cause major chaos on any day of the week. But, the family is uprooted when Martin is offered to coach his old college football team. What makes matters worse, is when Hunt's book (ironically, titled ""Cheaper by the Dozen"") suddenly takes off and has to go on a nationwide book tour. Chaos ensues, and Martin and Hunt have to choose what comes first, family or career.Predictable in every way, this could have played better as a network sitcom with the kids pulling off a major prank, and a moral value thrown in each week. Not a bad film, but, could have been better. Definite for family viewing."
4,ggood family show,GGreat movie for the whole family we really liked it. We actually got both the first and second and watched a double feature.
3,Cheaper by the Dozen,"Steve Martin is still hilarious after being a comedian for about twice my lifetime. The movie is mostly physical gags, but they are still fairly funny for a lighthearted weekend comedy. I found the kids in the family quite annoying, except for Tom Welling, who is a good actor, but is constantly put in the same roles. In fact all these roles are comfortable for the actors.Steve Martin plays a goofy dad who is way over his head and is the target for most of the physical comedy.Bonnie Hunt plays a loved mother.Tom Welling plays a rebelious teenager.Hillary Duff plays a teenage drama queen.Ashton Kutcher plays a unintelligent actor who is obsessed with himself.Did the actors actually get paid for this? Did they even do any acting?The movie is very predictable, but is still mostly funny."
2,--Bad Script--,"The cast led by Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt were terrific in their roles. The children were cute and also did a good job. The problem was poor writing. I expected that the story might be a little funny. It wasn't! It's rather amazing, that with all the excellent writers in the world, films like this one are produced. The original version of this movie was both funny and enjoyable."
1,Don't let your kids watch this movie!!!,"I'm a Christian homeschooling mom of four. We read the book, Cheaper by the Dozen, that the movie is based on, which we enjoyed (see book reviews) and recommend as a family read aloud. The ONLY thing common between the original book and original movie with this movie starring Steve Martin is the fact that the couple had twelve kids. As stated in some of the other reviews, the kids are bratty and have extremely bad attitudes. Younger children,especially, who may imitate characters shouldn't see this movie. Adults who don't want to waste their time shouldn't see it either. Read the book instead."
1,If it ain't broke...,"don't remake it.This is the latest in a long line of really pathetic attempts to modernize some very good film classics. As in the destruction of the ""Father of the Bride"" movies, this one is inane and completely misses the point and the humor of the original.I really wish Steve Martin would go back to walking around with an arrow through his head. He was much funnier then."
4,We're living it,"We have 10 children (from newborn to 18 years), so of course, we were drawn to this movie simply to see how they would portray a large family. They certainly went over the top with the mess and ruckus; our house is not like that at all. But as my wife reminded me, they wanted to make an entertaining movie, not a documentary!We're still waiting to see the original version from the 50's. I hear it bears little resemblance to this version, which shares only the title and the most basic plot elements.It's a wonderful movie about a loving family who stick together through thick and thin - and that IS just like our family!"
2,Good in a pinch,"Bought these on line as I couldn't find it locally. Tought it was a fair deal. Product was good and timely delivery.However, I was able to find it locally at two different local Chinese Grocery stores where it was also cheaper, much cheaper. 250g or 8.8 oz for 2.99 (as of July 2012). They also carried 500g packages but can't recall the exact price, believe it was 5.60something.Good product, fit the need at the time but cheaper if you look locally."
1,contains a lot of dirt,"The earthy taste of the tea comes from the dozens of rice size clumps of dirt left behind when the leaves are fully open. These are partial leaves wraped around dirt. Not only do I not recommend this to fellow tea lovers, I do not recommend this be consumed. The quality control on the their gunpowder process is less than adequate by western standards."
1,Serious quality issue,"We bought it for long driving trips but on the first trip out, the unit stopped working after 2-3 hours. No signal connecting the screen and the unit. Had to return it (after driving it all the way to southern Cal from bay area and then back). Couldn't figure out what the problem was. Screen was ok because it powered up.Very compact (although it weighs a lot -- help with the bouncing of the road.)Wish someone would update the unit. Sure is nice for the kids."
2,Maybe Not So Good,"At first the Audiovox looks very good for the current low price, and since I don't know of any other product like it on the market I bought one. But after less than 2 months ownership the LCD display started flickering during play and at times the audio output is not even there until I start a DVD over a second time. If I had it to do over I think I would save my money!"
3,One of the better bands of the 80's,"Cinderella could never lose their 'hair' image. One of the few 80's bands that had true substance to their tunes. Unfortunately it was lost in all the cheezy MTV vids and Poison/Ratt type costumes. Tom Keifer had a great voice for the blues until he blew his throat out. Listening to the first two albums you knew it was bound to happen. If 'Heartbreak Station' had been their first album, they would have been taken much more seriously.As far as the videos, who designed the chick's outfits? Yeah the girls had great assets, and bounced deliciously, but what was with the clocks on their heads?"
3,The Social Work Dictionary,I was hoping it would have a little more information. It is good in a pinch but is missing some key elements of social work practice.
4,what ya need,"Just about everything you need for your camera. A new case, batteries,chargers. It made my camera kit complete."
3,Wish I could give it 5 stars.,"For the record, I really enjoyed this anime but there is one major problem that need to be mentioned: There is no ending! SPOILER ALERT! The next to last episode ends with the main character fighting the main bad guy. Then in the middle of the fight the episode ends. The last episode follows 2 completely different characters who appeared earlier in the show. Then the episode ends and the end appears on screen. No resolution whatsoever. So while I enjoyed this anime I have to say if a complete and utter lack of an ending bothers you then proceed with caution."
5,A fantastic perspective shift,"I really enjoyed this audio program and the author's authentic and engaging voice.I was in the trap (that happens to so many of us) of being busy, charging ahead, and trying to keep up with so many tasks and to-dos coming at me each day.Listening to Mike's perspectives and using the tools to focus on the good stuff was calming, eye opening and...I'm happy to say...heart opening.If you'd like to enjoy the journey some more, live the ""life is good"" philosophy, and just feel better day by day and hour by hour you'll definitely love this program. Great stuff Mike. Thanks. Highly recommended."
2,Too bland for us...,"Nice product but to bland for our family- the cinnamon flavored ones were a hit, though."
2,Kids liked it but Expired,"This was ordered as a fruit substitute for my four kids on our road trip, but the food had already passed its ""sell by"" date when it arrived."
1,Not worth toilet paper,"This is a generic 'how to own a dog' template with a few initial breed specific passages and photos cut and pasted in from the Wikipedia and the AKC Belgian Sheepdog website. Nothing worthwhile or helpful to a new Belgian Sheepdog owner and the pages aren't perforated or soft enough for their most appropriate use...We did buy another book from Amazon, Belgian Sheepdog by Dr. Robert Pollet that was useful and well written. Try that one."
4,Solid hard-sf set in an electronic afterlife; his best yet.,"""Silicon Karma"" is Tom Easton's take on what happens when people can live inside a computer. ""Silicon Karma"" moves right along. Characters and dialog ring true (barring the odd clunk) but it's basically a novel of ideas."
4,good,am currently using this product its been almost a month already and i see some improvement.The taste is great and the price is worth it.
4,protien,"The protein taste is not bad. With it for the price, at GNC the bag is about $80. Recommend for anyone trying to put on size."
4,"Great tasting, not to sweet, not to bad","Scoop size = 4""X2.5"" 3""deeptaste is great just dont add to much water, if you want lesser taste, add a lot of water.I blend 1 scoop every morning, drink the half at 9AM and drink the other half around 2:30-3:00,and blend another 1 scoop at around 6PM, then drink half before working out. then drink the other halfwhen done working out. and when going to sleep blend 1/2 scoop for bedtime.FYI: this thing is hard to dissolve in water, literally you need a blender. =D"
5,Great stuff,"This is an awesome buy! Great taste, great quality. Only problem is it's alot of powder and hard to mix, make sure you have a blender or some utensil for mixing."
3,Really?,"Beware when buying. this product only has 8 servings! 8! its suggest 2 heaping scoops(334 g). In all, it was to good to be true."
5,Get Big,Good stuff only use one scoop at a time though instead of two. Take it pre and post workout and you will get some massive pumps
5,Amazing products,Got really nice taste .... It actually helps if you are considering to gain weight.I drink it every morning and before going to the gym
4,Great quality. Great value.,"I've been using this product for a few years. I must confess that i do not use this for its intended purpose; weight gain. I'm over 200lbs. I use this as a meal replacement when I'm on the go and I don't want to pick up restaurant food or when I need some extra calories after a big workout. I use a half portion (1 scoop vanilla) with soy milk, strawberries or bananas. It's pretty tasty. My daughter loves it. I feel the vitamin profile is head and shoulders over other shakes which is very important to me. It's not all about macronutrients. It's a great product, but I wish it had just a little more protein in my half serving. A 12 pound bag lasts me about 7 months. I don't use it every day."
5,"Tastes decent, lots of calories.","Good stuff. I got the chocolate. If I mix it in a blender bottle I can't use the full dose (each scoop is literally a cup and you're supposed to use 2 scoops) and it's slightly chunky. Who cares? If I mix the full 2 scoops in a blender with 16 to 20 oz of skim milk it's perfectly smooth and pretty tasty. (Milk first, and slowly pour in the scoops with the blender running on low speed). Throw in some instant coffee, peanut butter, and/or ground flaxseed for variety."
4,Preffer Chocolate,"This banana one is tasty and good, but usually leaves more chunkiness than the chocolate flavored one. Let me tell you, it does help put on some weight but watch out, you can get fat from this product if not taking according to your calorie intake. I've experienced it. I weight 178lbs and stand at 5' 7 1/2"" tall. I have around 20-23% body fat. I now know I should only take one scoop of this on my on days and not two because each scoop is 625 calories! GREAT PRODUCT OVERALL! 4 Stars because chocolate is better."
3,1st Try.,I will give it three stars for the nutrients.. but holy hell is the taste nasty! I was hoping for it to taste like ON gold protein but its straight up nasty. Will do another review after I am done with the 10lbs bag
4,taste,i love the taste just make sure u drink it soon after you mix it as far as the actual weight gainer working i haven't used it much because of health reasons but plan to use it in the future
4,Great Price,"Great price for 12lbs of food supplement. You can mix it with water, but it's recommended you mix it with milk or it'll taste nasty. Also, you'll need a blender since stirring it with a spoon will just result in large chunks/clumps."
4,Frendship Braclet Kit,This is a nice kit but i found it rather diffucult to follow the instructtions.
5,Excellent for girls who love to braid.,"Every Christmas I always get the various Klutz arts and crafts books for all the kiddos I shop for. It's always the first thing they seriously play with after opening all of their stuff. They get hours of creative entertainment out of them, and in our house it's a Christmas classic tradition to get Klutz books. They are worth so much more than the price, very professional, and tons of fun for the kids. You won't regret this purchase if your kids like to do activities and crafts. This set has very clear instructions for the different types of braiding, but I do recommend getting more thread than what this book comes with."
4,Fun summer activity for the kids,"This is a great activity book for the kids over the summer. However, some of the projects will require adult supervision just because they are a bit involved. My children are ten, six and six and were able to do some of the bracelets & bookmark tassles by themselves with a good amount of self satisfaction. I also purchased additional, thicker cording at the discount craft store and it seems to be much easier for the kids to work with."
3,I guess I was expecting more.,"More in the way of dark humor. More explict, really funny idiots offing themselves, doing us all a favor by not breeding. Instead we get the story of this wierdly neurotic ex-cop turned insurance-adjustor/profiler. Well I guess they had to have the sembalance of a plot. That's what they got. Michael (Joseph Fiennes) saves the insurance company lots of $$$ traveling cross country investigating strangely stupid deaths. His partner, played by Wynona Ryder is a veteran adjustor & doesn't really get him or his theories. It's very funny is spots. You know what's going to happen but it's funny anyway. When they try to get back to the plot for too long, it gets tedious. This could very well be a sit-com. You know: one stupid fatality every week. Lots of great cameos especially Adam & Jamie from Mythbusters. They actually did bust several of these deaths on their show. Before or after this movie I'm not sure. This movie had the potential to be much better. Mettalica rocks."
2,"Repetitive to the point of annoying ""Darwin Awards""","On the strength of actors like Joseph Fiennes and Wynona Ryder I would have thought that ""The Darwin Awards"" would have been much more engaging than it was. The premise of weeding out the gene pool by finding the people who commit the dumbest ""suicides"" (as it were) seemed really fresh and appealing.The execution, though, of this film is repetitive and ultimately monotonous as Fiennes and Ryder simply go from crime scene to crime scene with little interesting connective material.It is an interesting idea for a film, but it simply goes no where and is ultimately dull and lifeless.Not sure that the idea in Finn Taylor's hands was enough to sustain a feature film."
1,Illegible,"This book is illegible, it is produced by text recognition which is fine as far as the text goes, possibly very good; but it is quite insufficient for the titled book which has formulas and images, all of which are necessary to access the book's intellectual content. The formulas are not represented by anything other than a random selection of characters, images are completely absent. Any idea that this ""book"" represents a work by Frank Very is completely mistaken, to ask for money using this claim must be bordering on fraud."

4,Typical Forester,"Excellent read. Read some of his other writings, Hornblower, and never been disappointed. Going to look for more of his stand alone stories."
4,Great way to start the process,"This is a great tool to start the process of choosing a school or evaluating the ""fit"" of the school that your child is in."
2,Not recommended for Mac OS X,"I had a strange problem with the LX5 mouse on a Mac mini. Sometimes I would have to click more than once (up to four times) for a click to be recognized. It was VERY annoying. Apple has a number of known issues with mouse clicks; many of these cases involve Logitech products. Apple's suggestions did not help. Upgrading the OS from Lion to Mountain Lion did not help either. I replaced the LX5 with an Apple Magic Mouse (Bluetooth) and the problem disappeared.I have a MacBook that uses a very old M-RM67A Logitech wireless mouse with no problems. There may be Logitech wireless products that work well with OS X, but in my experience the LX5 is not one of them."
5,excellent for younger viewers.,"This movie is an excellent one for the younger viewers who are fascinated with dragons. Does not scare the young children but keeps the older ones attention. Teaches a few good life lessons,while being very entertaining. I would recomend it for ages 3 on up to adults."
4,"Thorough, scholarly, and pleasent to the ears","A thorough and enjoyable study that mixes the history of archeology with the excitement of first discoveries. Dr. Fagan's raspy brogue and mastery of the dramatic pause as well as his enthusiasm and depth of knowledge in the topic, make these courses even more effective learning tools. Few ancient civilizations escape his notice giving a breadth of coverage unmatched in similar courses. This is one I will listen to again and again."
4,Passing,"The novel Passing was enjoyable I liked how Nella Larson wrote the novel.The conflicts towards marriage,female sexuality,beliefs,passon,and fate.The novel had suspense and conflicts that deal with societal beliefs.At some point in the novel the reader starts to hate Clare's husband,John Bellew.The story made me feel the sense of the characters and what 1920's were like.Think about other literatures you read?for example maybe the play,Hamlet or Robert Frost poem ""Out,Out"""
4,this is so trippy!,I was a bit suspiscious about it..the cover is pretty cheap and do not reveal anything about the music inside which is very summery and unusual. I am already a fan...
3,Should be called the Arm Pit Wallet!,"I have a larger frame than many (6'2"" and Stocky) and this thing barely goes over head and arm and the pouch rides in arm pit and this is with both straps fully extended. May work better for skinny small frame guys! Just 4""-6"" more and this thing would work for almost anyone. It may have to go back as one cannot keep their stuff in their arm pit in the heat of summer! YUck!"
3,Okay,It didn't perform as I thought it would and I've already thrown one away (2 in a package). Should have ordered the silicone mats but it's an okay product.
2,Too thin,Product is not as thick as the reusable sheets I currently have. It will not hold up as well as the product I had previously.
5,Delighted to find these again!,"I used to buy these at a local cookware store, but they stopped carrying them, to my dismay. Like other reviewers, I prefer these to SilPat or other silicone pan liners for several reasons--such as lower price and thinner material--and use them for all my cookie baking, as well as under springform or pie pans. Mine lasted me for quite a while before wearing out. I leave them flat on the cookie sheets, but rolling is another alternative. Don't worry that they arrive folded and directions say ""do not crease;"" see another reviewer's response from the company."
1,Broke first time I used it,"You get what you pay for! The very first time I used this pool cue, the tip slip in half...not repairable. I would not buy another pool cue from this company."
1,Garbage Cue!,"I ordered a couple of these cues for the pool table my unit acquired and refurbished while in Iraq and was instantly disappointed. I went with a lower priced cue due to where I was and the possible abuse it would endure by a bunch of soldiers. I may as well have used broom handles because they would have been better. These cues are terribly light, narrow, and went unused due to the poor quality. I recommend to anyone looking at this cue to spend a bit more money and buy something better. You cannot see by the picture shown in the ad, but this cue is tiny, skinny, and extremely light. I only gave it 1 star because the system would not allow me to proceed with this review unless I gave it a star rating, but it deserves NO STAR at all!"
5,Exactly what I thought I would be receiving,Not gonna lie...I didn't read the book to much for the class I needed it for but it came in great condition and on time!
3,Fodor's guide to the philosophy of science,"This is a nice book, especialy if you already know some philosphy of science and want to see what a smart philospher thinks about practically every issue in the philosophy of science.As a teacher I was looking for something to use in a class on the subject, and decided I just couldnt use it. The trouble is that the author doesnt give us much help taking the philosophy of science seriously. If we're scientists why should we care? If we're philosphers, then knowning what Godfrey-Smith thinks the right anwer to a question is wont help us figure out why the question is important."
2,"OK, but not scientific","There is definitely some interesting information in this book, but the use of biased anecdotes and several totally false claims make it difficult to determine how much of the book can actually be trusted.Overall it wasn't worth buying because I had to spend many hours doing my own research on the authors' claims. As always books that rely on anecdotes to back up claimed benefits should be viewed with suspicion."
4,"Great strategy game, but missing a few pieces","This is a great strategy game and it doesn't take 3 hours to play. However, the product that was shipped to me is missing several key pieces so that is frustrating."
1,NO BOOK YET,I'D LOVE TO GIVE YOU A REVIEW BUT I STILL HAVEN'T GOT THE BOOK!!!! THE FIRST ONE I ORDERED IN AUGUST GOT CANCELLED ON ME AND THIS IS THE SECOND ONE ORDERED SEPTEMBER 7TH AND IT IS OCTOBER 8TH AND I STILL DONT HAVE IT BUT THEY TOOK PAYMENT. SORRY CANT TELL U ANYTHING ABOUT PATH THROUGH CATHOLICISM!!
5,Really great for Condorito fans,"I've collected all the Condorito magazines since I remember and obviously I got this first book. It really is different than the other comics as it features shorter stories, but it still gives great laughs.A must have for fans and and worthy read for non-fans."
5,AWESOME!!,"A wonderful ending to the series! I love being able to read beautiful, well written, spiritual fiction. Thank you Lauraine!"
5,Terrific Book -- Insightful and Prophetic,"This guy really knows his stuff. The changing nature of business risks is something of value to every manager, regardless of level. I was really impressed with his predictions, especially that of the domestic steel industry collapse based on international markets.The book discusses a variety of themes involving how today's economy requires that companies embrace risk to chase the rewards people want."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money - Buyer Forewarned,"HP acts like a company on its way down.Great concept - poor execution. HP support on this product is horrific. I have been waiting over 3 weeks for a response to inquiries and each time I initiate contact, I am told someone will get back to me in 5-7 days.Product has bugs that HP knows about but you spend hours conscientiously trying to debug. Worst of all, they offer s-video hook-up but no where can you find the proper cable or can you get the specs from HP. Some idiot at HP told me it was a special 5-pin connection. As it is, it is a 7-pin and most connectors to either a Camcorder or PC are 4-pin. I have spent hours trying to find a 7-pin male to a 4-pin male and it is not going to happen. I have already returned two cables.I have wasted hours trying to get this product to work like promised and I don't expect that to happen anytime soon or ever.Buyer be forewarned."
1,Bad,"I didn't see the negative review when I bought my Movie Writer. I have spent days on the phone with HP and finally a gentleman in India admitted that HP was having a compatibility issue with Dell computers and so if you have a Dell, do NOT buy this movie writer. It is totally frustrating. No one admits the compatibility problem at first! So, I have hours invested in a product I have to return."
1,What a peice of JUNK!!!,"Where can I return this thing? If you want hours upon hours of frustration, this product is for you. I'm very computer savvy and was never able to get either one of my two fairly new, high-powered Dell computers (with a USB 2.0 port) to recognize the new drive. What's worse is that HP customer service for this product is a complete joke. I've talked to over half a dozen technical support reps (in India, of course, where HP made the brilliant decision to relocate their tech support unit), including one supervisor, who were clueless about the product. To make matters worse, several reps, including the supervisor, promised to call me back with solutions and I never heard from them again. How's that for customer service?"
3,uneven but fun,"This an uneven book. I found it entertaining and enjoyable; I liked both the major characters and had no trouble following the plot line. That said, the characters are static and the plot is superficial. HOWEVER, the dialogue and tension between the major characters is delightful - reminiscent of Hepburn and Tracy. So whether or not you like it, will depend on what you're looking for. It's a light, entertaining read - but not well crafted."
2,Pick out the good and throw away the rest.,"This book had several good tidbits of information to help any single parent. I'm happy to have read it, however there are many opinions of Kevin Leman's that are not backed by facts. I would advise anyone who reads this book to pay attention to the practical advice, but ignore the opinions - some of which lead me to question the sanity of the writer - such as ""boys should live with moms and girls are better off with dads."" I don't think he'd be saying that if he had a little girl ask him to go bra shopping or bring up the topic of menstruation."
2,Boring. . .,"Not a great way to spend your money. It lacks the graphics, the customization abilities, and all else needed for a great game. I suggest, if you want a nice racing game, the following:(from best to next best)Gran Turismo 2Gran TurismoF1 World Grand PrixThose are you best chioces."
1,PEICE OF [JUNK],"WHO CREATED THIS [GAME] ANYWAY. THE WHOLE THING IS A DISGRACE TO RACING FANS. THE GRAPHICS ARE THE WORST WE'VE EVER SEEN, THE SOUND FX ARE POOR, THE GAS MILEGE STINKS. WHEN YOU DAMAGE YOUR CAR IT DOSEN'T LOOK REAL, NIETHER DO THE TRACKS. AND WHAT REALLY STINKS IS THAT YOU DON'T GET TO PICK YOUR PAINT SCHEME OR NUMBERS. CHEAT CODES AREN'T WORTH LOOKING UP. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ... PEICE OF INSANITY."
1,The Heather and the Thistle,"I was really looking forward to this book. Imagine my shock at the description of a Highlander as more or less totally uneduacated. Heather even asks if he can read. Scotland, not too many years ago, celebrated 500 years of public education FOR EVERY ONE. Most Highlanders spoke atleast 2 languages and many spoke 3 or 4. I don't where the author researched her history but it is sadly lacking. It totally misrepresents the Highland people. I could not get past this part of the story and put the book down."
4,I like this one,"First, let me mention for those interested in the subject that this book shows babywearing in the background in one of the spreads.The moral of the story, how a simple dinner became a feast when ""all their friends"" were invited to share it, is neither overly expressed nor too subtle for little ones. The illustrations are bright and colorful, this book will attract a lot of attention :)Please note that it's a bit wordy, probably suited for the older of the 4-8 crowd. The same advice *definitely* goes for the supplemental information at the back of the book, all sorts of things on how people live in Kenya and a few simple Swahili phrases and, of course, a recipe :)"
1,Planet of Crap!,"The worst of the Berserker books I've ever read, this novel barely has enough meat to work as a short story.The centerpiece of the book is a tournament where vaguely Norse warriors fight to honor the god ""Thorin"" and his right hand ""Mjolnir"", in classic Saberhagen allegory. However, the story instead chooses to follow a weakling who's dragged to the planet on a hunting trip and turns out to be the only one who'll lead the fight against the Berserkers....and that description is actually a lot more interesting than the book, which mills around, trying to find something interesting to do for about 200 pages or more, failing the entire way through. As a matter of fact, there was only one mild surprise in the entire story, and it was foreshadowed in the beginning. Go figure.If you're going to read a Berserker book, put this one at the bottom of your list, then burn the list before you get that far down, then burn it again, just to be sure."
4,Definitely for adults seeking to escape into a sexy fantasy world,Roberta LaTow creates steamy characters that draw you into rich world that most of us will never know otherwise. You'll almost certainly find something or somebody between these covers that you'll wish was sharing your days/nights.
1,This game is not worth the time.,"Although the computer version of the series Command & Conquer (C&C) is definitely worth playing the playstation equivalent is not. This is most obvious in C&C Red Alert Retaliation. For anyone that has ever played any of the C&C Red Alert on computer, the new units aren't any good. The nuke truck can be easily blown up killing only infantry and power plants, the mad tank takes too long to fire its shockwave and is lightly armored so it is also easy to blow up, and tesla tank is only good against infantry leaving it vunerable to tanks. For those of you who haven't played C&C Red Alert on computer. This game is by far lame. You are not allowed to save in the middle of a mission, the mission starts over when you load it. Also it is annoying to play with a playstation controller because it doesn't provide the same control as a mouse. This is not a game to get anyone. Get them the computer version it is much better."
1,Absurd design. It's like leasing a rice cooker with a large downpayment.,"As others have said, the design of this and other Sanyo rice cooker models requires that 1. its clock be running, and 2. its clock-sustaining battery be replaced each 4 to 5 years, which entails dismantling the cooker, de-soldering the old battery and soldering in a new battery.So if you want to use this cooker for more than its first 4 to 5 years, unless you are handy with an electronics soldering iron (and have the right type for working with circuit boards) and are able to dismantle the cooker (I tried and could not do it), you will have to pay again some 30% of the cooker's original price each time its battery dies.Essentially, this line of Sanyo rice cookers (this model and similar ones) are for most people disposable: you may as well buy a new one when its battery dies.There will be no more Sanyo products for me. ""Once bitten..."""
3,Built-in Obsolescence,"I bought this rice cooker a few years ago and have been really impressed with it. But it has a clock which must be on all of the time, and a battery which keeps it running. Well, the battery ran out - apparently it has about a 4 year life. Now every time I plug it in, the rice cooker will not work until I fiddle with the clock buttons and pretend to set the time.So I want a new battery - seems logical, right? But you can't get a new battery - you have to take it into a repair place (the nearest one is 30 miles away - and I live in Minneapolis!). They have to solder the a new battery. An expensive undertaking for a $100 appliance!I looked in the owners manual and sure enough, it's all documented there. After 4-5 years, you need a new battery. But in all practicality, you may as well plan to toss out your perfectly good machine and get a new one after a few years, or fiddle with the clock every time you want to use it.WOW! Beautiful product design. Fatal Flaw."
5,Life without Floater...,"Since I've moved across the country, I've had to suffer without being able to see Floater live. I've had to depend on my CD collection. The East coast has never heard of Floater.I highly recommend any and all of Floaters releases. If you find one, snatch it up, it's only a matter of time when the world knows who and what Floater is all about.Floater, native of Washington, Oregon and California drives hard notes with symphonic tones to your very core. Supplying listening satisfaction to a wide range of listeners, I would suggest this band to moshpit dwellers as well as Floyd fans.Personal favorite: The Sad Ballad of Danny Boy and Crawl to you from the Glyph CD.Fourty Thumbs Up!"
4,It wasn't that bad.,"First impression I had for the first part of the book....'disorienting'. No one denies that the writer sure mad malkavians mad. However, I am sad to say that the writer lost me in it. Things never mad sense...okay they are malkavian they are not supposed to make sense. I think the disorienting part of it is that you have no clue when his hallucinations are occuring compared to the rest. You gotta pay close attention to the dates of the chapters and the dates on previous events in the previous clan novels. The best part by far of the book is the end....the author seriously excels during that part and finally you start to make _some_ (some not fully) sense of the story."
1,Sadness... not Madness,"As I feared after finishing the Horribly written First Novel in this lamentable series, Clan Novel Malkavian is even WORSE than Wieck's first foray (Clan Novel Toreador). This book is completely incomprehendable. The style is neither clever, nor insightful... it's just BAD. This may very well be the single worst book I have ever had the displeasure to read.The saddest part of this is that, in general, I had begun to enjoy this series. Parts 4 and 8 by Kathleen Ryan rose to such heights of excellence that I had hoped (vainly) that there was finally some plot to this plodding embarrassment of a series... Alas... it seems I was wrong."
5,"""South Pacific""","This is as good a production of ""South Pacific"" as you could hope to see and hear. The cast is just about perfect and everyone from the biggest star to the smallest cast member performs flawlessly. The orchestra is big and luscious and all the voices are strong and well cast. Reba McEntire is a delightfully spunky Nellie, Alec Baldwin genuinely funny as a big bruiser of a Billis, and Brian Stokes Mitchell brings just the right dignity to Emile and justly had the audience explode into applause at the end of a truly extraordinary rendition of ""This Nearly Was Mine"".One would think that one would miss the scenery for a show such as this, but curiously enough I found this concert version with a minimum of props, and only suggested costuming works even better than the lavish film version, in that one's imagination is far more engaged.I cannot recommend this performance and the surround sound DVD highly enough."
5,A Winner,"From my Barbara Cook DVD I learned that Reba McEntire was tremendous in the revival of Annie Get Your Gun. Therefore, I was delighted to learn that the concert version of South Pacific with Reba in the Mary Martin role was available from Amazon. The entire cast is fabulous. Reba did not disappoint either in acting or singing. She is a true musical comedy star. In addition, I can't get out of my mind the marvelous rendition of This Nearly Was Mine by her costar. Reba, please do a concert version of Annie, Get Your Gun for the DVD audience."
1,I hate this baby monitor,"This baby monitor I bought a year ago and has never worked right since day one. I bought it before my daughter was born so by the time we used it and found out how horrible it is as a product, it was too late to return it. The sound never worked. I hate it. I bought it for $250, what a waste of money."
1,"Definately a ""do not buy item""","Good brand name, nice look to it, but to be quite honest it is a piece of crap. Poor picture quality and make a popping noise that won't stop. I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this, unless you have $200 to blow."
4,Good product,"I bought this edger because I HATE string trimmers for edging. It did a very good job, although I had to get ""into the groove"" of using it. Much easier than a shovel and the results are great. You may find it challenging if your grass is significantly overgrown, but otherwise it does fine."
5,Another great ska CD,"I recently saw Edna's Goldfish at Skater's World in Wayne, New Jersey, and I had not seen such a great band since the Toasters came this way back in May. Immediately after the show, I congratulated the Edna's boys and bought their CD, which, as the show, did not disappoint, rather to the contrary."
4,Pretty Good Action RPG,"Brave Fencer Musashi is the first action RPG that I have played on the Playststion, and I must say that I was a little disapointed. The main problem with this game is that it is just too short, and that the plot isn't as detailed or as interesting as FF7 or Xenogears. What the game lacks in those two departments it maks up for with excellant graphics and sweet gameplay. I really enjoy the attack system in this game which is original, and useful. Even though the game is kinda short, it does offer a nice challenge in some areas of the game. I would recommend this game for younger role playing fans, most fans of games like FF7 might find this game a little too easy and childish."
5,one of the best rpg's,"i don't know how you people can insult this great game. you can't compare it to zelda, different sysem, company, and it rules. the age difference is a factor too. time spent on a game isn't everything. graphics, playability, and difficulty are the biggest factors. a great game. the best. as good as final fantasy . bye bye."
4,A great action RPG!,"This game is very fun and I recomend it to all action RPG fans! It is much like Zelda in several ways, but has many new features that other action RPGs do not have! The voice programing is great! Each caracter as thier own personality and most of them are halariously funny! that was very well done! Pluse, instead of the "" traditional sword and shild"" Musashi has two swords. The game play hours are pretty good too! It probably takes about 32-45 hours to master. The graphics are pretty good! I never expected Square to come out with a ""action Rpg"" but hey, those geniuses had to make one sooner or later right? . It is not chalangeing enouph, so that wiped a star off my rating. But overall, it is a fun game, and I'm sure you would enjoy it!"
2,Doesn't compare to Zelda!,"I bought this game because Square is my favorite developer of video games. Too say the least I was very disapointed. A very short game, took me less than 12 hours to beat it. Mediocre story line at best. Voice acting decent but not inspiring in the least. In my opinion there is little to no replay value. Where are the days of Secret Of Mana? I asked myself many times when playing this so so game."
1,Annoying Fencer Musashi,"RPGs are my favorite genre. Especially action ones, which are few and far between. I was hoping this would be another ""Zelda"" or ""Alundra"" with better graphics. But it was simply annoying. I cringed the first time I heard Musashi's HORRID voice, and every other time I heard it. Big disappointment. The game was promoted as an RPG, but it doesn't remind me of an RPG. It's an annoying adventure game with annoying voice acting. The ""hero"" looks and sounds like a bratty ten year old. Definitely not for everyone, especially someone expecting a typical RPG. Don't disappoint yourself like I did. This is the first time I ever returned a game, in the same night to boot! Rent it first!"
1,would be minus numbers if they let me...........,"I have never read such a dire book, written so badly ever that I can remember, once I buy a book i usualy try to finish it no matter how bad...... this book beat me, I just could not bring myself to pick it up and carry on....... I have even given to to friends to see if they could read it and none of them have got past the 1st 3 chapters.........."
3,a solid but somewhat dry overview of the UN,"As a reporter who has covered the UN, I read this book around the time I first came here. It is helpful for understanding the basic layout of the organization, its history and purpose, which are things that I was completely in the dark on before I came here and rather suspect most of my countrymen are ill-informed on as well. The chapter on the history of the Security Council is extremely helpful in getting a basic understanding of the UN's role in major foreign affairs in the past 60 years. However, this book is often dry and rambly in its later stages, and just doesn't have that much to say about, say, NGOs and civil society. By contrast, I found James Traub's ""The Best Intentions,"" on the twilight of the Kofi Annan years here, to be a more engaging, if slightly less objectively detached, treatise of the United Nations."
1,I love Diablo,Diablo was and still is one of my favorite original playstation games. Unfortunately i wore out my copy and i'm trying to find a new copy. As much as I love Diablo there is no way in HELL i'm going to pay $ 200 for this game!!!!
4,first time through,"I knew this was old when I got it. The interfaces are horrible, but the game is such a classic it was still playable. We just tried to play it again recently and the interfaces became more of a problem... now I'm looking for similar games. It's sad really, this game was wonderful, but the bigger my tv gets, the more unplayable it seems."
4,A solid solar panel,"Not a bad panel. It has Siemens mono-crystalline cells(36)and tough glass. Case is plastic but fairly solid. Solar cells are mounted in EVA under glass. Accessory connectors are VERY well thought out with a charge controller, auto plugs, battery connectors, and a voltage step-down set-up for lower voltage appliances. Props are a not well-designed but I generally don't use them anyway- this panel easily props up against just about anything and doesn't slide. A little heavy at 9lb but solid construction. The 30 watt output will charge up just about any smaller appliance like a lap-top or AA charger- will also charge up a car battery with a good sunny day.The review above is misguided in recommending the Coleman over this panel. The Coleman has cheaper amorphous cells with only a fraction of the power output- not able to charge a laptop and is also made in China. Reviewer doesn't seem to have seen the 30 watt panel before commenting."
4,"An eye opener, Aha moments, and Great Advise for Parents of Teens!","I have found the book to be very informative and right-on when it comes to parenting teens. My son is 14 years old and this book has come so handy and the information invaluable. I learned the mistakes I've done along the way and ways to correct and improve my parenting techniques. The book ""God's Design for the Highly Healthy Teen"" has brought to me the biggest Aha Moments I've ever had. Currently I am sharing this book with my husband because he is more of a Dictator Parent and I want him to realize the emotional and behavioral damage that can cause to a teen who is already going thru so much at this age. I feel fortunate to have read this book while my son is 14 because I still have time to correct and implement great parenting skills that will last a lifetime. Not to mention, I have 2 other sons that are younger and I will do it all over again!"
4,Fine Premiere Album!,"This is a very creative album, incorporating a variety of styles. The music and lyrics are inventive, although they get a bit wordy at points. I found the most interesting work on the cd the multi-movement (six tracks) ""Foghorn Concerto"", and I really enjoyed the over-dubbing of Amy Guskin's vocals on ""My Time Travel Machine"". Paul Nordquist has a winner here."
5,This is the best fighting game around.,"I bought Bushido Blade 2 because I thought it would be the same as the first with a few new options and nifty new graphics. Boy was I wrong. They kept the concept of the original but gave it all new moves, 22 playable characters, and beautiful animation. With all it's stages and many weapons to master, this game still provides a ton of fun just as it did when I got it a year ago. Every one of my friends who played it are now heavily addicted and we've all developed in depth fighting strategies to use on one another. Contrary to what some might say, there is little luck involved in the one hit kill system of this game. Skill and timing always defeat luck."
5,Finally a realistic fighting game.,"What may turn some gamers off from this game could be it's best feature, it's so realistic. Unlike the other games out there theat deal with more fantasy then true fighting, this game is all about not getting hit, and the true art of weapons. Finally a game where only one fatal blow can end it, making defense almost more important then offense. The First bushido blade was a classic and this is not far from that. A wide range of characters, along with different styles and individual story lines gives the lucky gamer hours, days, weeks, etc. of great fighting fun. you master this game then your a true master."
2,Just not very impressive,"The overall impression of the game is...eh. I would recommend renting this game before actually buying. There were plenty of characters and weapons, but there were just not enough moves to master in this game. Playing the quest mode a few times thru and the pattern of the game becomes rather stale. I did have fun playing it with some friends, but the interest never lasted."
2,Try something else,"This game is fairly primitive, both in gameplay and in graphics. It's a straight-up fighting game that pretends to have a story and a purpose--but basically you go from fight to fight, and that's about it. I hardly ever play fighting games, or any games really, and I finished the game with one character in about a half hour. Supposedly they expect you to play through with every character, but hearing each character's voice or slightly different way of fighting is hardly a reward. Compared to a game like Virtua Fighter 2, this game pales, and I'm sure there are lots more martial arts games out there that are more worth your time."
1,Complete Boredom,"Good graphics. That's about the only good thing I can say about this game. For a generation that is used to such exciting moves and characters as from Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, and Tekken, this game is a complete disappointment. I made the mistake of purchasing this game and was completely bored after about 30 minutes. There are no impressive moves, weapons, or story lines. Don't necessarily take my word for it. But definately rent this game first before deciding to purchase it."
3,"MARIA DIAZ.....""MERENGUE TIPICO""","Maria Diaz es considerada como una de las mejores exponentes del merengue tipico de Republica Dominicana. En este disco se destaca el ritmo del acordeon, instrumento que Maria Diaz toca. Algunos buenos temas del disco lo son ""Me voy mañana"", ""Que vuelva"" y ""Dos amigos"". En este disco encontraras la musica tipica de la hermosa Republica Dominicana.Tambien recomiendo los siguientes CD's: ""Pasional"" de Jessica Cristina, ""Expresion"" de Gilberto Santa Rosa y ""Tesoros de mi tierra"" de Milly Quezada."
4,So much easier than a regular paci,"Just got the Wub today. It turns out the attached pacifier is the exact same brand of newborn paci we've been using, so baby already loves the pacifier. The attached pink horse is adorable and stays on her tummy when she spits the paci out instead of falling to the floor. The only reason (and this is kind of a big reason) I took a star off is that the horse's back seam was wide open when I recieved it. It's too much trouble to send it back so I'm just going to stitch it up myself."
5,Big hit,Our daughter loved this and used it quite often until she grew out of it. Highly recommended.
2,waste of money,Cute concept but the binkie doesn't come off so there is no way to wash it or change it out. It looks cute so I gave it 2 stars but I would save yourself the money and find something else.
3,change the neck strap,"First time I used this product the adjustable piece broke (the thing that adjust the neck bands), however I was to lazy to send it back to the company, so I recreate the Isolator, I took the neck strap off and remove the screws and drill the holes little bigger and went to lowes and brought two carabiner that hold about 200 pounds(2 dollars) and washers to stick in the holes of Isolator that I drill and I used a computer case shoulder strap that had close and open end metal hooks.I know what you saying!! however, I would still had spend 10-20 dollars or more on another one, I guarantee now this product is better than anyother and better than before. Weider should pay me to remake there product, if you have the money and you find it not worth it doing what I did, buy a different brand. Biceps Isolator are very good in trying to get bigger biceps try it with phospaghen elite from EAS (creatine) talking about a hell of a pump.P.S. the three stars I gave it was for me not Weider."
2,Well said but poorly edited,There may be worthwhile things written in this book but the editing is so bad that I find each page rather tedious to get through. I am reading the kindle version and it is ripe with omitted words and grammatical errors.
1,Not Impressed,"I have had my HDP5-4 Pooper Scooper for about a month and must admit I purchased it due to the many positive reviews here. However I have found it less than effective. I have two Labs and therefore, considerable poop. When cleaning the back yard, I can only scoop about 4 piles into the bag and the bags pop off. It doesn't seem to hold the weight. Also, if the grass gets a little longish, I find it difficult to scoop the poop into the bag. The rake part doesn't seem to separate the poop from the grass very well. The first couple of scoops go fine, then I end up with the old two-piece shovel and scraper thing I have been using. Maybe there's a technique I haven't figured out yet, but I tilt it forward as suggested, and it certainly doesn't ""fly"" into the bag as other people have described. I think I will go back to the simple two-piece scooper set I originally had."
4,Hound Dog review,This is a great product for picking up dog poo. I have used this brand for 4 years and think it works well. My only complaint is that the plastic ring broke on my current scooper. But it's fairly inexpensive and if you only buy one every 4 years or so that's a pretty good deal.
3,The Great Coon Dog,"I think the book sounder was alright but it had alot of racism.The part I liked most was that the dog was honest and loyal. Although the boy didn't have alot of things he always made the best of it,and he never stopped looking for his father.The boy always had an open heart.I think sounder was a good book.The pictures in the book were awesome."
3,The Interesting Dog,"I did not like the book,because it was to sad,boring,not inter esting,and made me go to sleep.Iliked the book because the boy did notstop looking for his daduntil he started school.The book is emotional."
1,The dog and its owner.,I think the book was kind of sad because the dog got shot and one side of his body is damaged and his ear got shot off.The boy thought he was dead and started to cry.But he does'nt know the real truth about the dog!
3,The Great Coon Dog,This book was a great book. I love stories about dogs so I really liked this one. I have read a lot of dog books and this one would be in my top 5. I loved how the boy wanted to learn how to read and in the end he met the teacher and learned. It was sad how Sounder died. I wish there was a series.
2,"This book is boaring, and I don't like it","I think this book is bad, and I don't like it.I think it is not well written.Theres no drama, not intresting things, and the book doesn`t gives you a reason to read it. I mean you don`t enjoy reading it.The ideas are not clearly talked about, thats why the book is very confusing.Actually it is real (because the book says that) but is not belivable because I don`t think that the boy could go arround the state, because he has no money, nor food, and he could not return to his home.I would not recomend this book to people that like life. Only to people that realy like to read."
5,"A Book Full of Expression, and Especially Memorable","I read this book several years ago, and have since regarded it as my all time favorite book. In fourth grade, when we were asked to make an ad for our favorite book, I chose Sounder. When I was asked what my favorite book was at the beginning of school to learn more about each other, I chose Sounder. Now, when my LA teacher asked for our favorite book that we would recomend for others to read, I immediately thought of Sounder. I agree with many of the other reviews. This book was certainly a tear jerker, and it is most definitely a good example of how blacks were once (thank goodness not anymore) treated."
5,Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!,This book is really touching. Through all the hardships the family goes through they still survive. I love this book because it teaches me about an aspect of life that you can never give up no matter what. I think this book is good for all ages. It shows true love for an animal and shows that they are human beings too eventhough dogs are an animal they are your own which is why I cried when he ran away
5,A tissue please!,Boy did I cry through the whole book! It had me rooting and sobbing at the same time! What a read. Simple and short but complex as the nature of racism. It was one of the best human relation I can think of. I could place myself there and it was indeed a battle among humility and love.
4,4 Stars for Sounder,"""Sounder raced after the wagon. No one yelled after him. The mother stood still in the doorway. The deputy who wasn't holding the reins turned on the seat, aimed his shot gun at the dog jumping at the side of the wagon and fired."" This moment changes the life of a young, African-American boy and his feelings toward others. He undergoes the hardship of racism toward him and the family. The boy is determined to find his dad, who had been arrested because of stealing a ham for the family. He also continues to look for Sounder, the dog who had been shot and ran away. Then his luck changes. I give this book four stars because the subject matter did not catch my attension but still is a great story told from the eye of a African-American boy who didn't give up."
2,Big Bold Dog,"Hi my name is Jon, and I'm here to tell you about the Story of Sounder. I thought that it was pretty monotonous, but it had a good plot. It was about this boy that has to go throught some emotional, and exhausting times. This boy is black and is in the time period where black people were treated unjustly. This family could work together to build their way through things. I don't really like this book because it was pretty violent. You could read this book and see if you like it. You can see that I didn't."
2,The Anythings,"&#65533;The pine trees would look down forever on a lantern burning out of oil, but not going out.&#65533; The book is like the lantern. It never goes out and never flames up. The book just keeps on going and going and going. You just can&#65533;t get hooked. There is only one climax in the book, and that is when the boy&#65533;s dad gets arrested which happens in the first twenty pages! The only character in the book that gets a name is Sounder. All of the other characters in the book are named Boy, Father, Mother, or Children. It will take you dog years to get through one page. Sounder stinks like a wet dog!"
2,Not as good as the old formula,"The new formula is not as good. You have to use more of the product to make it sweet and the new ""natural"" sweetener tastes like ""fake"" sugar. Not impressed. I wish they would go back to the other stuff. Now I have to find a new sports drink."
2,breaks,love it but 2 of them broke in a very short time. seemed to be where the cord went into the mouse
1,skippity doo dah,"if you don't mind that your mouse skips all over the page and you have to find the pointer, go for it."
5,Definitely worth the money,"We purchased this fireplace two weeks ago and have used it every night since -- it's great!! We were going to get a smaller less expensive one but splurged -- I am so glad that we did! Low maintenance and easy to clean. Functional as well as aesthetically pleasing, what more could you ask for? Our 3 year old loves to watch me 'feed the fire' so that he can toast marshmallows. The only negative thing that I can say about this fireplace is that after we opened the box the opening instruction sheet was lying on top with the assembly instructions. Not that it mattered anyhow, Opening a box is not THAT big a chore! Buy this fireplace -- you won't be disappointed!"
4,"Absolute Power, Corrupts Absolutely","I would recommend this book to ALL parents. It is a shame and a total travesty that in a so called ""Free County"" innocent people are being put through something like this! They should be re-named ""CDS"" (short for CHILD DESTRUCTION SERVICES)... I, for one am outraged!"
2,Disappointing quality,"I bought 2 of the Winsome Wood shoe racks - primarily because they would fit in an existing cabinet. The quality was lower than I expected, however. They were somewhat difficult to assemble - some of the round support rods in the back were warped, the shelves fit very tightly and were hard to wedge into place, and one of the shelves was missing a pre-drilled hole for the metal pin in slips over to secure it. Overall these are functional, but not the best quality."
3,"MST3K's back, sort of","I guess like most folks who would be here looking at this DVD, I'm a rabid MST3K & ""RiffTrax"" fan. So when Michael J. Nelson, Bill Corbitt and Kevin Murphy were working on some direct-to-DVD riffing; needless to say I anxiously awaited the release dates. This 1962 movie is a bleak, nihilistic, story about an veteran who now works at a junkyard, hired by some stripclub owners to launch an amphibious robbery of a bank?store?, and falls into a hip, swingin'60's Romeo and Juliette affair with Rue McLanahan.I really wanted to like this DVD, a lot. Compared with the MST staff in their prime, this would not be a best effort. Sure there's some good riffs, but the snap, and depth of the writing doesn't seem to be there. (Maybe the lack of the other writers has something to do with this.) The interstitial I thought broke the rhythm of the DVD; unlike those of MST3K episodes.Anyway, if you're a fan, you should probably buy it; it's enjoyable certainly, just not ""all that""."
2,Nearly impossible to look up a name's meaning,"A very scholarly and authoritative work to be admired by academics everywhere - almost useless as a quick means to look up what a botanical name means. If you were to take a semester or so studying this work, it would probably turn out to be very useful. For example, the chapters are broken down into Habitats, Geographical Names, Colour Terms, Greek words, Descriptive Terminology, Chemical Reactions and Tests, etc. So, if you happen to already know that sagittatus is a descriptive term, you can go to the chapter on Descriptive Terminology and find out that it means arrow-headed. If you don't already know this, good luck finding out what it means in this book."
5,botanical latin. not for the novice.,"This is a great book, but much understanding of the subject is needed before hand for a person to really get much out of it. It is a great purchase for serious horticulturists, but if you are just a weekend gardener this is not the book for you. If you specialize in a certain Genera and more knowledge of specie name basis is what you want this is a good buy."
1,Disappointing despite great graphics,"I wish I'd taken a closer look at this before purchasing. As with the other titles in the series, I was sucked in by the splendid images from their voluminous archives. What a trove!I found the layout and overall look of the book appealing, but was completely turned off by the smarmy & sophmoric text accompanying the graphics. Just lame and unnecessary.It's a shame, as it all could have been avoided had they chosen not to futz with the material so much. Less would have been more.I won't be picking up any of the other books."
2,Heater only heats really small rooms,"This is only good for bathrooms or small rooms. I had it plugged in on high and it barely heated the area where I was sitting, but if I put it in the bathroom with the door closed it heated really well."
1,Not much help,Total waste of money. The book's content covered absolutely nothing that was on the exam.
1,A waste of time and money,"I live on the ground floor of a four-floor condo building, so naturally I thought this antenna would give me better reception than a powered antenna in my living room. Wrong! First, the patch cables they send you with the product are too short to install on a 3 LNB DirecTV dish, so I had to make a trip to Radio Shack (the 4 foot cable is just right). Second, the coaxial connectors on the antenna show their poor craftsmanship (Made in China) since the threads are not flattened on two sides, making in near impossible to screw on all of the connections in such small quarters without stripping the threads. But all of that would have been worth it if the product actually worked. It doesn't. At all. Really, I went from receiving approximately 50% of the HD signals in my area to receiving just one. I returned my Terk TV-5 for this product and what a mistake! This product is not worth the time or the money. Buy something else."
4,Has worked for me for years!,"I have had this on my Dish system for years. Picks up local HD and regular channels just fine. We are too far from the metro (live in southern MN) and it picks up locals from rochester, austin, mankato great. It is currently on our dual tuner HD DVR and we have had no issues with it. Best part is we can also record locals with the dvr, so at times we are able to record 3 programs at once!"
4,A fun tale to read. I hope the movie does it justice.,A great tale. It had me reciting poetry and making up rhymes of my own just so I could be a part of the story. Very enjoyable.
3,Great book but Kindle edition doesn't cut it,"I really wanted to purchase this book for my Kindle 2 so I could reference it wherever I go. Unfortunately, the conversion to Kindle format made it much more difficult to read, mostly due to the fact that the code samples do not format correctly on the device. I imagine that the book needs to be re-converted to make use of the fixed-width font capabilities that are present in the newer Kindle software. Until they fix the formatting for Kindle, the print version is the only one I would recommend."
4,Bijan for women,"Product was shipped quickly, the item has become very difficult to find and a great deal more expensive than it was."
2,"The DVD version is edited, just like the TV version","I saw the Al Pacino interview on DVD, and they have edited the language, just like the TV version.What is the benefit of buying the DVD version if we cannot hear the full dialogue of these great actors?Terrible decision to edit the DVD. I recently saw the Robin Williams interview on Bravo. Enormously funny, which made me think about buying the DVD version, if it exists. However, the TV version is heavily edited or ""bleeped"" out. Now I know the DVD version is exactly the same as the TV version. I think that one of the benefits of buying a program is that we get to see the full, raw interview. Not for this series, unfortunately.4 stars for the interview, 0 stars for the Actors Studio dopes who decided to heavily edit what these great actors are saying."
4,"Move, Mount, Shoot","An extremely well-written book about the art of shotgunning. Bruce Bowlen explains shooting technique with a thoroughness and clarity unmatched by other authors. It is a comfortable and informative read. One month after reading this book and adopting many of its suggested techniques, I shot my first perfect round of Skeet."
4,Exactly what I needed,"I needed a good, cheap, speedloader holder for my new Safariland speedloaders, this fit the bill. Construction and stitching seem good, just wish it had snaps, I Hate velcro."
5,One of the best Praise CDs available.,"Really love this CD, with some of the best & most popular Christian music today by one of the greatest praise & worship teams. A 'must have'!"
3,Yikes!,"This is an interesting but dangerous tool for those who seek to condemn belief or behavior they see as foriegn, in the guise of being a ""Christian."" Those who would seek to harangue others with their piety forget that religion is an intensely private thing that often goes to the core of a person's being. Of course this insensitivity that ranges from holier-than-thou to outright bigotry can always be justified because it ""says so in the Bible"" or ""God said."""
1,Not all non-christians are subjectivists,"I'm always astounded at the tendancy for christians to pretend that all people in the ""WORLD"" can be fit into one nice catagory. I'm not a believer but I'm not a subjectivist either. I certainly believe that an objective world exists. I'm also smart enough to realize that objective reality isn't found by believing ""The substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.(Hebrews 11.1) Christians are nothing more than very selective subjectivists them selves. They need to deal with the log in there own eyes before dealing with the log in the eyes of relitivists and subjectivist they condem."
2,Rushed attempt at transcription,"The transcriptions in this book may provide one with the ability to play something that sounds something like the recordings, but are not completely accurate. Tones are missing. Fingerings are incorrect. One may argue that the musicial notation is somewhat accurate, but the tablature seems to indicate that it was produced only by translating the notes, not by listening to the recordings (e.g., by listening to the recording one could determine whether a note was played higher on a low string or lower on a higher string).Pass on this book if you wish to play a Rush song exactly as recorded. Instead, look to back issues of guitar magazines (especially Guitar for the Practicing Musician, no longer in print)."
4,Great for travel,"Bought this before going on a trip to Germany hoping it would be stable enough for my 30D paired with a 70-200 2.8L IS lens. Setting it up as a tripod is definitely not enough to support the weight (although I assumed it wouldn't); the legs would buckle and the whole thing would collapse. However, when secured to the top of a railing, the head held up just fine. With all the other lens I have the pod works amazingly well; I even figured out how to set it up vertically to get some interesting ground shots. Highly recommended!"
2,Disappointed!,"All photos of this on Joby's website show this tripod with the additional $40 ballhead attached. Now after trying to connect this to a tree, I realize how useless this is. Yes, it would pretty good as a standard tripod, but if you want to dangle it next to a tree or anything similar that additional ballhead is a must. That makes it a pricey tripod.I'll test a bit more, before my review is final."
4,"Good, but...","This is a decent gimmick tripod, no question about that. If you can grip it onto something, you're good to go. If you have to use it as a regular tripod especially on any common indoor surface eg. a counter, table, desk, anything tile, glass (you get the idea) it's not great."
5,A Winner!,"This thing is amazing! I can use it with my Bloggie video recorder or even my huge Nikon D3000 DSLR. It is very versatile and gives you a lot of options for positioning it. It is very lightweight and easy to tote around. You can easily stash it in your backpack or other small bag (or even large purse, like me!). The one annoying thing about it is the fitting. To switch from a smaller to larger fitting you have to screw on this very, very, very tiny piece that will definitely be easily lost if you're not super careful. When I go from using the Bloggie to using my DSLR I have to make sure I place the fitting somewhere it won't get lost and then replace it back on to the tripod when I'm done. Other than that, I love this thing and you can't beat it for the price!"
3,Convenience over height,"It's light and can be stowed just about anywhere, but you're really going to miss the height of a normal tripod from time to time.Definitely has some uses though particularly for long hikes or traveling light."
3,Kinky,"This is good for traveling and when you are trying to get hard angles, but definitely does not replace a tripod. Must get ball head too!"
1,Absolute Trash,"Several joints were cracked so the unit would not hold a Canon Rebel XTi with a standard lens. This was a brand new item, so I suspect the reliability is questionable at best after some usage. Mine went back to the store."
2,Where's the Quick Release?,"I have a smaller Gorillapod that I love---but for some reason, they cut corners and didn't put a quick release mount on this one. Not having a quick release for a small tripod really limits the utility. I'm very disappointed in what would otherwise be a great product."
5,Useful and versatile camera support,"This Gorillapod works quite well, as a tripod or as a clamp. I have not had the chance to make extensive use of it, but in a test it was capable of supporting my Nikon D40 with 70-300 mm Nikkor lens. It is a bit bulky and can be a challenge to fit in a small camera bag."
1,My Third Leg is Useless,"Within a day of owning this product, one of the joints near the base cracked, preventing the leg from securely attaching to the joint. Like others have mentioned as well, it's rather difficult to position the pod with a dslr mounted in positions they've advertised."
3,fun for the kids,"My 2 and 5 year old love Hi-5 and we have all of the recent dvds. They are all more of a compilation of episodes rather than exact episodes from the theme. We just received the Animal Adventures, and it is set up the same way. While the kids enjoy it, I feel the editing is not very good. Like another reviewer said, the transitions from skit to theme song are poor and the song is louder than the skits. My 5 year old noticed it and thought that the dvd was skipping. They don't seem to mind it though. The rest of the dvd seems fine."
4,A good technical dictionary,"This is a good TECHNICAL dictionary which provides translations for many words that could never be found in a normal Portuguese-English Dictionary. I am involved in aviation in Brazil and found quite detailed pictures of airplanes and airplane subsystems. I found this to be true of many other subjects in the dictionary such as construction, zoology and even aerobatics. One small problem is that the English translation is in British technical terms. On some subjects this causes a bit of confusion as to the correct translation. Overall, a very helpful dictionary."
5,FYI: Regular Print Edition (isbn: 1555838537) Sells for MUCH Less Than the Large Print Edition (Though it is Out of Print)!,"I haven't read this yet, but I was researching it and noticed there is a regular print (NOT large print) version that sells for a fraction of the cost of this one. The ISBN is 1555838537; but note it is out of print, so it may not stay low priced for long as this novel is considered a classic."
5,Excellent Book for Everyone,"This book is a must-read, simply because it provides a valuable perspective into a community all too often marginalized and misunderstood. It is a good book just as a novel, but as a fount of information it is doubly valuable. It opened my eyes to the world of butch-femme, and was very thought-provoking. Everybody should read this book. Be warned, though, it is very intense."
5,heart wrenching,Anyone with a heart can find atleast one character in this book that speaks to you. Some of us find atleast a little of us in every character. From the time i picked up the book I couldn't put it down....and by the time i turned the last page and finished reading it.... it was time to start all over.This book should be a must read for every family or friend that has trouble accepting us for who we are.... maybe then they would realize just how hard it is for us.
3,Great book for beginners only,"Junior programmers will probably enjoy this book, but profi programmers won't find more than 5% of this book useful. There is too much theory, and the whole book would fit to 300 pages (instead of 840). Buy this book if you dont have more than 2-3 years of software-construction experience. This book would deserve 5 stars, when you change the name to: ""Code complete: a practical handbook of software construction for BEGINNERS"". For experienced programmers is 3 stars rating of this book more than enough..."
1,"Over-hyped, disorganized laundry list","For the experienced programmer, ""Code Complete"" offers nothing useful. I bought this book with high expectations but found it to be a verbose enumeration of rudimentary software engineering and programming principles not worth the paper it was printed on.The application of common sense to coding is not revolutionary. Therefore, ""Code Complete"" is not worth your time because this is all it advocates, while taking over seven hundred pages to do it. The hype surrounding this book is, to my mind, thoroughly unexplainable. CAVEAT EMPTOR!"
3,"dated, still good!","Most all the advice given is still relevant and very good. I especially appreciate how all sources are properly referenced and credited.After reading though, you see the foundation for n-tier component based development was architected long before it was put into practice. Given the author's excellent ability to objectively balance features and requirements for Enterprise development; Had modern Visual Basic (modern being 32-bit VB versions 5 & 6) it would have been the authors tool of choice. Sadly, we get a chart comparing QuicKBASIC to Turbo Pascal. With no references to modern languages popular in the Enterprise (such as VB and Java).Still a good source, should be required reading any hobbyist or student looking to program professionally"
3,okay if you are the slow kind,I did not think this book should be printed except for the students that cannot understand the most elementary concepts.
2,A poor disc of mainly interviews,"This appears to be the same disc as one which is already released in the UK, if so be aware that it contains very little actual music as it is mostly interviews with small parts of the odd song thrown in, if like me you like the music but don't really want to hear what Meat Loaf has to say then I suggest you avoid this disc."
1,Too Thin,"These boots are very small and tight, would fit a maximum of about an 18in thigh. Also the shoe part is very small and uncomfortable."
4,It is cool.,I like this phone I've bought so far. It looks really cool and is easy to handle. The sound and images are beautiful.
2,Uncomfortable,They are nice to look at but the tough leather is awful. I've had these for over a year and I've worn them no less than 20 times. They still haven't stretched to my feet. Not good for a 9 hour work day.
4,Another Classic!,"Before Goldstein and Marion, there were Fowles and Symon. If Goldstein is a nightmare, then Symons can prove to fill in alot of gaps. Topics are well covered and many example problems are given. Not as complete as Marion, but just as valuable. Symon contains alot of ""old school"" skills which prove to be very valuable.It's a shame that it takes Fowles, Symon, and Marion to get you through Goldstein, but nevertheless, take a hint and stock up if you are to face the Goldstein book."
2,Symon sucks moon rocks,"Unfortunately, so do all its competitors,and for similar reasons. The lessons of 40 years of physics education research have totally failed to penetrate this bastion of didactic exposition. I used this book as an undergraduate, and I teach this course now, and I would not touch Symon -- it is pedagogically totally ineffective. It is structured as reference, not pedagogical, material, but it is at too low a level to be usable for that purpose like Goldstein or Jose and Saletan. As such, it is neither fish nor fowl. The overall problem is that junior level classical mechanics is a black hole for physics texts -- there are no good ones, but this is among the least effective (and expensive to boot)."
2,Too much digression.,"If you like a large amount of digressions by an auther; this is the book for you. Students in need of a text that can help them through tough proofs or examples of problems should not use this book. For example on page 70 the auther writes, ""The assertion ""we can show that..."" throughout this book will mean that the reader who has followed the discussion to this point should be able to supply the proof himself.... Long or tricky proofs will either be given in the text, or a referance cited, or the reader will be warned that it is not easy."" Under this footnote in my book is a big question mark."
1,Smells a little fishy,"I was a little skeptical as to how authentic the three previous highly glowing reviews really were, having read this book. I clicked on them and found that all were written by people who had never written any other reviews. I have heard of the practice of authors writing their own, highly favorable reviews under pseudonyms and I strongly suspect this is what is happening here. Manhiem is an internationally ignored anthropologist trying to elevate her reputation. Writing pulp fiction is not the way to do that. Neither is penning your own glowing reviews. Buyer beware!"
4,this author was ahead of his time...,"I was familiar with James Churchward's books back in the 70's.Now that I am older,I am able to fully appreciate the work,research,& dedication that Chuchward exhibits.It is definitely fascinating .I would suggest reading ""The Lost Continent of Mu"" as well."
3,Not a bad book,This book is really interesting. I am taking my first computer science class and this book is actually interesting to me and helps to improve the course.
3,Was OK,As far as a shooter game goes this was not bad. Loaded easy and has a pretty straight foward play. Could use some puzzles to make it a little more difficult but the choices on difficulty level made up for it.
1,Compared to Tribes 1,"Compared to Tribes 1. This game absolutely is horrible. This should have stayed in beta and never released. It was a waste of the 25 dollars i spent on it. Sickening. Horrifying on how bad this game was turned upside down from the original. Little server modding capabilities. Only some of the things good about this game are the Ski Mode, Vehicles, Packs duel capabilities, that were implemented."
4,Wow,"Just an awesome game. Similar physics as tribes 2 and tribes. Skiing, jetpacks, some of the same weapons, the laser rifle, spinfusor, and mortar then you have your new weapons like the grappler, rocket pod, and blaster (which is like a shotgun now). It's a great FPS and like was said before the learning curve is steeper than most FPS. You actually have to strategize for this game. Using different modes of communication and the command console (a map of the battlegrounds showing enemy installments and the enemy) make teamwork essetial for this game. Not to mention the ability to fully mod the game!On the bad side:The base gameplay is slow, the inventory organization screen is just a mess and very ineffecient unlike the one in tribes 2 which I must say kicked some major BUTT! The the weapons are dorky. The mods will mostlikely change all of this! Can't wait for the full version of the game to be released!The game play is slow"
3,An average book.....,"This book was just what my title says. It was an average book with nothing that really stands out about it. It look four days to read and for me that is a huge amount of time. I just couldn't sit down and read it in one sitting. It was almost too heavy. At the begining Ms. Fforde tried to write in the ""english"" language, well for an American, it was very hard to read. Finally she stopped and from then on, I didn't have to half way guess what the characters are saying. The story is a little hard to follow in that the three characters lead almost seperate lives. The only thing they have in common is that they live and work together and that is not even discussed that much. It was much more like trying to read three stories that were interuppted and had big time gaps. I guess if you didn't have anything better to do this book would fill a couple of days."
1,N.G.,"Interesting concept, but there are definetly much better games out there.Gameplay is bad, very confusing, and I lost interest in a matter of minutes. I expected better from SquareSoft!"
3,parasite eve,this game was fun to play. it was for my boyfriend's birthday and he was shocked i had found it. thanks
5,A screwed up masterpiece,"This is one of the most screwed up musicals I have ever heard, or been in I guess I could say. However, it is the most magnificent thing that has come out of my CD player. This is one of Sondheim's best scores. The music and lyrics capture the ideas and feelings of the different assasins perfectly. John Weidman's script is amazingly accurate and original. If you like wierder musicals or simply good music, you should buy this now."
4,"Different from revival, both are good",I owned the revival cast recording before this one. Both are excellent. This recording feels much more like a live performance than the revival recording. I highly recommend owning both versions of this show. Both are excellent.
5,Easy to read,"For someone who is not an avid reader, this book kept me involved and made some points via the story that have been helpbul to me.Since I am not a voracious reader, I may be easily entertained.Hopefully that bodes well for others who are not big fans of fiction writing."
2,Too violent,I did not like this book at all. It's completely not my taste. The book starts out in Rome AD 65 and I'm sure it was written with lots of historical accuracy but it's so violent and terrible.
4,Classic Christie,Interesting to compare the original with my favorite PBS versions. Easy to picture every word & scene. A rare book to reread & still enjoy.
4,Shed your tears if you like; not on statistics though!,"Derek Rowntree's book is truly a primer for non-mathematicians!I ""hated"" stats!! Not really! The truth is I have been fearful of stats for a long long time. This is one statistics book that soon became my ally, helped me learn and/or revise the statistical concepts I needed to master, to pass the required research methods and statistics graduate level courses.Don't misunderstand me; I could not escape the obvious! I had to put in the needed efforts. I learned because I was not afraid anymore to explore the contents; I could explore the contents because Derek's approach was not intimidating!!! I can't believe it, but ""Statistics Without Tears"" now allows me to keep my eyes open for situations when I can put the ideas to practical use. Go get 'em ""non""-mathematicians!!!!!"
3,"The Magazine is great, But the subsciptions service is not!","I really enjoy this magazine, so much so that I asked for it as a gift for Christmas. But, as of ten months later I have not recieved any of the magazines. If you want a subscription for BBC History my suggestion is to contact the magazine directly, especially if you live in the U.S. I have contacted the magazine department at Amazon and have not received any real response. This was supposed to be a gift subscription. It was not worth the money."
4,The Cherokee Trail,The Cherokee Trail was a very enjoyable story. He makes his stories very interesting and leaves you with a warm and pleasant feeling.
4,Not ordinary L'Amour book,Good story with good mixture of unsure behavior with contrast between good and bad. Good mixture of philosophy of life and action.
2,Lacked intensity,"The Cherokee Trail is the story of a Civil War widow who travels west to run a stage coach stop in Colorado. The book had the suspense and flavor of a run-of-the-mill episode of Gunsmoke: interesting enough while it lasted, but hardly anything compelling."
5,The Best Christmas Carol one can ever hear,I would say this is the best Christmas carol one can ever hear.
1,Pay the extra money to avoid the stink!!,This item is inexpensive and I thought it would be a good buy since you didn't need to buy extra bags and could just use the same bags for both this and your garbage..but I was wrong this diaper pail lets all the smell out! My son's whole room smells like Pee and Poo as soon as you place more than one diaper in there. You end up buy twice as many garbage bags just so you can quickly replace the one filled with only a few diapers. Totally a waste of money since I am now on the hunt for a better smell resistant diaper pail. Don't learn the hard way as I did just buy a good one the first time around..hope this helps all you mothers and fathers out there :-)
2,Would not buy again,"From the beginning the lid would not stay closed. I have to keep a wipes container on top to keep it from popping open. This was OK for a while, but now I have a toddler who thinks pushing the lid down and having it pop back up is very amusing!I like that it takes regular bags but it is rather stinky. The lid and the odor is enough to give it a negative review. I am due with #2 and will be buying a different diaper pail this time around."
5,"Nice, simple pail","This is exactly what I was looking for : an old fashioned diaper pail with no liners or refills to purchase. It's a good size and any kind of deodorizer should fit in the holder.That said, it isn't the color shown in the photo. It's definitely tan and white rather than white a blue. Still a good product for the price though."
2,Challenging,"It is not a very nice game as once you hit the walls,you will fall.It takes a long time to get back on the bike.Thus,slowing you down.The good thing is that it is very challenging as the tracks get harder all the time.So if you are a racing maniac,you should get it."
5,Hard copy at last for Soft Machine,"I saw Soft Machine open for Hendrix in Cincinnati years ago. I had never heard of them, but they are the ones I remain active fans of. And by association, Robert Wyatt (never knew ""Wyatt"" was actually his middle name until I read this book) and Kevin Ayers, Hugh Hopper, etc.Too bad ""Soft Machine: Out-Bloody-Rageous"" has such a cheap-looking cover (why use such a grainy b&w; photo on a book about such a colorful band?), because what's inside is first rate! I actually skipped to the part about first trio version of the Softs (the band I had seen, first hand), read through Hopper's departure, then skipped back to the original quartet. But it's all good, Then there are the extensive discographies, a listing of every performance and recording session, and a section about what the various members are doing now. It's all there. Throughly researched and engagingly written."
5,A Nice Tool for a Small Plot,"If you use the Dog on solid, dry soil (not damp or wet), the plugs will feed through nicely.I suggest you stop immediately if plugs clog the openings, and wait for a dry spell. Soil composition is everything to successful use. Don't force it.I aerated my front yard, about 600 sq. ft., in an hour. When plugs were stubborn, I flipped the Dog over and tapped the handle on concrete. The holes cleared in seconds.By keeping my foot on the cross bar while lifting the Dog after each punch, I was able to ""walk"" a route of 6""-spaced holes at a good pace.I'm not convinced that plug aeration does much good, but I wanted to give it a try. This gadget is now part of my Green lawn-keeping tool set."
1,Must have received a dud,"Worked for about three ""pushes"" then one side plugged up. After cleaning out the plugged side it will slightly work another couple times. I measured and found that the entrance diameter of one of the holes is smaller than the other side. I hope that mine doesn't work simply for this reason and not because the product sucks in general. It would also be nice if there were four tubes in stead of two but Im sure that might not be practical. Either way, I'll find myself a small electric aerator rather than take my chances with another one of these."
1,Disappointing,"I got this product based on the many positive reviews and was looking forward to using it, but for me it did not work. After only a few ""pokes"" the soil got stuck in the tubes and I had to clean them out with a screwdriver. I tried again with the same result. The soil was moist but not wet. Maybe it works with bone-dry soil, but in my region (New England) it rains more-or-less regularly year round so the soil rarely get that dry. I probably won't bother to return it, but I will definitely need to find another way to aerate my lawn."
4,Hard drivin' rock n' roll with clever lyrics.,"The debut release from Luxx was a pleasent surprise. From the opening track ""Inside Your Head,"" to the final drum beat of ""My Indian"" the disc flows with great musicainship and a female lead singer second to none on today's circut. There are no fillers, each song is heart felt and a few hit below the belt but all entertain. If you like the guitar cranked up load, a heavy backbeat, and great,heartfelt vocals, pick this disc up today."
5,Just right!,"The plastic is the perfect size and shape for awareness cookies! The plastic won't rust, and can be cleaned and sanitized easily. I thought that they would be too big, but honestly were better than I expected as the size kept the cookies from crumbling to pieces. I highly recommend this cutter! Super fast delivery too!!!"
2,Norelco,Had used Norelco over the last 10 years. I have been very disappointed with the Arcitec razor. Takes longer to shave than previous models. The travel case should me more user friendly.
2,dissapointed with Norelco,"I've used Norelco for many years, but when I bought this new model I was very dissappointed. It simply does not shave as well or as quickly as any of my previous Norelco rotary models. It is a nice looking and feeling design, but seems to only cut near the center of the 3 heads. The heads also appear to have less clearance and pivot than previous models, and does not cut longer whiskers as well as older models. Furthermore, the trimmer on this one is a joke, no where near as good as on previous models. I got tired within a couple of weeks of it taking forever to get a mediocre shave, and decided to try another brand. I got one of the new Panasonic microscreen shavers, and could not be happier. Much closer shave, much quicker, cuts long whiskers, great trimmer, equally easy to clean."
1,Works but not for my beard...,"I bought this thinking this work well, this was the second electric shaver I am using and I thought my beard was not very tough, especially with the razors and cream. However, I guess it is tough, as this shaver took forever to shave the easiest shaves. My neck would always have left over hair, which would mean that I would have to shave the way I normally did earlier with my razor and cream, so it does not make sense at all for me at least to buy this product and sadly, it does not work for me."
1,Horrible shaver,"I've always used an electric shaver. So when my last one needed replacing, I decided to get a really good one. Boy, did I make the wrong choice. It gives a barely acceptable shave if you shave every day. If you skip a day, forget it! It will take forever to shave. And forget doing your neck, it just won't take off the hair. The little half inch wide trimmer is a joke. And make sure you shave BEFORE you put on a shirt, because you'll be wearing all the hair it doesn't seem to hold in.Rotten product, can't believe I fell for the hype, and can't believe I have to buy a new shaver."
1,Norelco keeps making a poorer and poorer product,I've owned 4 Norelco's over 15 years and each new one is worse than the last one. This latest Arcitec with its lack of replacable blades is why this company should go under. Stop buying their stuff.
2,Looks better than it shaves,I have it for over 3 years now and even after all the marketing hype and mixed reviews I got it but unhappy with it. The best I ever had was a panasonic and I will get one next. This just looks good but shaves are not very good
2,"Comfort yes, close shave no.","This razor is very comfortable. The pivoting heads conform to the lines of my face quite well, however the razor leaves many long hairs behind. I need a close shave for my work, and what this provides is unacceptable."
2,"Must clean after each use, and it is 3X harder to clean!","Not much better than the conventional old style Norelcos without the ""neck."" And, worse, must clean after each use, and it is 3X harder to clean because you have to individually open three compartments, using two fingers, after every use or two, compared to the old style where you can just flip it open, easily, with your thumb and clean it every week or two. That is many hours extra work, over the course of a year or the shaver's lifetime. Not worth the extra trouble."
5,So Very Impressed,This Electric Shaver is the very best shaving and ease of cleaning it after shaving experience I have ever had.Thank you Norelco and thank you Amazon for the best price for this magic facial hair removing instrument.Anthony L. Vitale
5,Happy husband!,"My husband has a ""barbed wire"" beard and finding him a razor that gives a smooth, close and fast shave has always been a challange. We saw the advertisement for this razor on television and he was interested. I went online and priced it at many different ""stores"" but Amazon was best.He got it for Christmas from Santa and he loves it. It shaves quickly, close and easily. Everything he wanted."
3,clippings ????,"Is there an electric razor that does not throw clippings all over your shirt, counter, etc??? when shaving dry? OK in the shower."
2,""" Do not leave this shaver plugged in for more than 1 hour""","Makes one wonder when they definitely tell you ""Unplug the shaver and do not allow it to charge for greater than 1 hour"". Sounds like the old lithium ion safety problem strikes again. Pretty terrible outcome for forgetting to unplug the shaver- one morning. I guess I can go get a $20 timer and plug it into that to make sure. But for a top-dollar device, one would expect the engineers to design in the required charge termination cycle ?"
5,Relatively speaking,"I have used Norelco razors off and on for nearly 40 years. I've read a few reviews who charge that the quality of this Norelco is not near that of their razors of years gone by. To some degree, is anything as good as it used to be, I don't know? I do know that materials are lighter and this often is used to explain less quality. Everyone's beard is probably a little different, but I do not find this razor lacking at all in shaving performance, it shaves me closely and without burning. This is in contrast to the Remington that I just replaced. I also find this razor to be a lot easier to clean than previous Norelco razors. I also find the reservoir to be quite adequate in catching the shavings. Two thumbs up!"
3,"Ok, But","I own this shaver for over a year now. I already own an old Norelco (http://www.amazon.com/Norelco-Deluxe-Reflex-Plus-Shaver/dp/B00009RB11). I find myself using the old shaver instead of this model. I like to shave my head bald. This model leaves some hair. I have to use the 6863 xl model to finish the job. Then I feel my head very smooth, with almost no hair missed.If you like to shave bald, I strongly recommend the 6863 XC model. But Don't leave it plugged in for too long. It will reduce the battery life."
2,Save your money,"I replaced a Norelco speed razor that was getting old. This 1050 will give a close shave but does not cut longer hair at all. It takes a long time to get a complete shave. Sometimes, the highest priced item is not best, and this is the case. Save your money and get an 8240 Speed. The new 8240 is very easy to clean. The 1050 does not allow you to remove the heads, they only flip up. I like to use oil before I shave and the 8240 allows me to remove the heads, dump them in a container with some rubbing alcohol, and easily clean them with a few shakes."
2,Home Baking? For an army maybe,I have never used a single recipe in this book since its seems to be super-sized recipes. My husband and I both bake bread and other items but this is just too much.
5,Great look! Shipped perfectly~,"This item shipped pretty quickly, and it was already asembled when it arrived. The driver only delivers to your door, he does not set it up. The only part that needed assembly was the top part. I will say that I thought the bar was going to be higher/taller, but once you add the top shelf piece, it adds heigth. It looks great in our mini bar area nook!"
1,cheap,it is made if plastic and the water pressure kept unplugging the hose. It could work if you worked on it to make it stronger.
5,"Poignant, moving, and just down-right awesome","there is no one word that describes emotep's music. The songs are simply powerful and heartfelt. they are well written as well as masturfully executed. They are truly one of the best indie-rock bands out there right now, and this album proves it!"
5,Greatest Collection !,"If you're looking for christmas songs collection that would fit and lift up your holiday spirit best, THIS IS THE ONE !Plus, This would fit in any occasions that will just make your days more joyful and fulfilled."
4,1st Time with Sandra,"After seeing Sandra Collins spinning live in Orlando in front of Oakenfold....and seeing her put on a better show than Oakenfold....I had to buy her latest CD as I was not familiar with her at all. After listening to this 2-CD set many times now I can tell you I don't care for CD1 at all but CD2 is brilliant. The first time it sounded like a bunch of unknown songs (which it is) but by the third time through I realized how well they flowed together to make a mostly trance statement. I'd recommend purchase for that reason if you like Oakenfold, Tiesto, Corsten and others who produce techno you can dance to."
2,Kind of painful.,"I first saw this book in draft. I was frustrated by muddled wording, unmotivating examples, icky hand-drawn graphics, and (of all things) horrible pagination. When the book went into print, I noticed that not much had changed, except that the icky pictures had now largely been transformed into icky Mathematica images. The pagination was still bad. A confusing text with poor flow and unclear explanations. Hope that your professor is more lucid."
4,"Best Mamma ever, but British accents are bizarre","Lansbury was the single best Mamma Rose ever, for this reviewer's money--she had both the best voice (though lacking the sheer belting power of Merman) and could act better than any of the others (with the possible exception of Betty Buckley). This recording is worth hearing just for her, though the awfulness of Dainty June's Newsboys singing with cockney accents (""Extra! Extra!/'ey look at the 'eadloines/ Around the biggest scoop of the decaide!"") significantly detracts from the listening pleasure of this recording."
4,Another Amazing Interview from the Inside the Actor's Studio,"Inside the Actors Studio: Johnny DeppAs an avid movie buff and big fan of Johnny Depp, I really loved this interview. The lecture theatre (Actor's Studio auditorium) was packed full of eager students seeking some wisdom from this young master and the secrets of his success. As well, there was a huge crowd at the door who could not get into the studio. It was one of the most sought after interviews in Actor's Studio history.I have enjoyed many episodes of Inside the Actors Studio but this was one of my favourites (alongside Mia Farrow and Jessica Lange).My favourite part of the interviews are always the concluding questions, ""when you go to heaven and God welcomes you at the gate, what would you want him to say?""Understandably, the interview time imposes restraints on the number of movies covered and importantly working with a young Leonardo Di Caprio. Also question time from the audience was limited.Otherwise, excellent ****"
2,Not up to standard,I was very disappointed with Johanna Lindsey and this book. I've read all of the other Mallory novels and was looking forward to the excitment of another regency romance with strong-willed heroines and the men who love them. What I found was a silly girl and a rushed plot line. The writing was more like an outline and did not draw me into the story. I would love to read more about the Mallory's and will probably take the chance and hope Johanna Lindsey takes the time to write a good book the next time.
2,very disapointing!,"Lovely cover......... Liked that the Malory's are sprinkled thru out. But it really felt as if someone else wrote the book. Jumping from location to location, insipid heroine, couldn't get to know the hero. Thru the book whick took me a week to read because I was so reluctant to pick it up again and again, I would find myself saying 'this suck' and it is soley becasue I expected a Johanna Lindsey book, not a first attept.I regret that I didn't like it. I wanted to ."
3,A rainy day read,"Hey faithful fans, I have to say I was disappointed in this book too. I mean I had to start it three times. The first few chapters were just boring. I was unable to actually relate to the characters, but by the last couple of chapters I was snagged. Not her best write, but by the end she did make up. I feel like she is running out of ideas. Man of My dreams, unique, great, gripped you. This is amateur in comparison. Have fun with it!! If your a JL fan, its a must read."
1,I couldn't finish,This makes me so sad and I commend you all that finished the book. I loved JL and the Malory books were keepers. The last 5 or so have gone steadily down hill and this was the straw the camels back.I couldn't get through the dialogue and didn't care about any of the charachters. Usually when I find a book I don't enjoy I read the last chapter. I didn't even bother.After paying full price for the hardcover I won't be back.I would love to hear from Ms Lindsey about her writing and where she is going.
2,Another Mallory??? Please no more!!,"I should have given this book a one star, but I actually finished it. If it was that bad, why did I finish it?? I don't really know. So, I will justify myself by giving it a two stars. I think the Mallory novels were good for about three books (Regina, Anthony, and James) after that it just becomes a lot of repetition. I used to LOVE Johanna Lindsay - but I just think some authors only have so many books ""in them"". Maybe she is all written out. It is too bad, especially now that her books are being released as hardboooks. It is a lot of money to spend on a dud."
1,Where has Johanna gone,"I didn't even finish this novel. The characters are flat. Their emotions toward each other are horribly written, or non-existant in the case of the hero. The plot is more suited to a novella that she strung out over waaayyy too many pages. I honestly thought I had mistakenly picked up the wrong author. All I can say is, ""Wow. Where is Johanna Lindsey?"""
2,Not her best,"Usually, when reading J.Lindsey's books, I fall ""in love"" with the hero. Not so with Drew. I did not even like him much and there is no way I would want him to be my man.. I hated that he bought necklaces for women in each port, I disliked how he so thoughtlessly 'ruined' her and repeatedly insulted her. He practically rapes her. He just does not seem like an honorable, hero type like I'm used to getting from Lindsey. It is a so-so read at best and my least favorite of her works."
2,Too small for price.,"Silly me thought this was a bargain till it arrived this is the small one, which goes for a $1.98 at the hardware shop. I was thinking it was the larger one."
1,Dangerous,"I weigh 300 pounds, much less than the rating of this unit. On sitting down in a restaurant, the plastic holding a wheel cracked, the wheel came off, and the rollator fell over. I landed on the floor and struck my head.DANGER!"
3,Wagner power wallpaper steamer,"I like the way the steamer works, but had only used it twice when it quit. I called the company and was told it could be sent to them and they could fix it. When I had it ready to send, the next person I talked to at the company said that information was incorrect and that it could not be fixed. I was not happy about how this situation was handled. I was told by that person that no one at the company would have told me it was fixable. Without coming right out and saying it, they were calling me a liar."
3,ok for home repair,"This is NOT for commercial use, only for easy-medium difficulty jobs. Should also come with a smaller nozzle for those hard to reach areas"
1,dangerous and a waste of money,"This product is dangerous, it drips for one thing...and it is very hot steam!! It takes a lot of time to get it set up, filled, and steaming, ready to go...as you work it is very hot, in an enclosed space ""bathroom"" it was like a sauna. It does loosen the paper, but it is so hot the glue is sticky and hard to scrape.FORGET IT.IF YOU HAVE STRIPABLE PAPER, STRIP, THEN SPONGE WATER ON PAPERBACKING - WAIT A FEW AND SCRAPE...MUCH SAFER...DOESN'T TAKE THAT MUCH TIME..IT GOES QUICKLY AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING BURNED! WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP!!!"
5,Great Fast Working Machine,"I started to strip vinyl wallpaper using chemical solutions. After 4 hours, I had only been able to remove 20 sq. ft. I saw the reviews of the #705 Steamer and decided to give it a try. This is the best $49. I've ever spent. There's nothing fancy about this steamer. It is simple to use and VERY effective. Using this unit, the wallpaper was removed from the entire room in 3 hours. I'm always suspicious about the effectiveness of many ""power"" gadgets, but this unit is outstanding at removing wallpaper!"
1,Displeased,Product is top heavy and flips over whenever you make a basket. It needs to be weighted on the bottom.
4,economy but good,"Within the category of 'economy' I give these clamps 4 stars so far. Until I can afford to get more professional ones they do get the job done - and even when I do get fancier ones, I know I'll be using these as well. One can never have too many clamps. They're clamps, and they clamp."
5,NASCAR at ITS BEST,I STARTED TEACHING MY NEPHEW THOS ONE WHEN HE WAS 3. ITS HIS FAVORITE GAME NOW AND HE IS VERY GOOD AT IT. HE ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT. THIS IS SO MUCH MORE FUN FOR EVERYONE THAN THE TYPICAL DRIVING IN A CIRCLE NASCAR GAMES. I AMAZED IT WAS NEVER UPDATED FOR OTHER PLATFORMS AS IT JUST PLAIN FUN. THE NEPHEW IS NOW 4 AND EVEN WHEN I TRY TO SHOW HIM OTHER GAMES IT ALWAYS COMES BACK TO THIS ONE....EXCELLENT INVESTMENT FOR FUN FOR EVERYONE. THE 4 YEAR OLD BEATS ALL THE NON VIDIOTS EVERYTIME THEY DARE TO CHALLENGE HIM....I THINK HE HAD A GREAT TEACHER! :)
5,Compare with other games,"NFS:High Stakes is similar to Gran Turismo, but the graphics are more like those of Spyro. Though NFS wants a different car selection (three instead of two, more variation), the car damage feature and wider selection of games make it as good or better than GT1."
1,This game does not play on my PS3,"I bought this game the other week and found it would not play on my PS3. I bought it because I used to play it at my friends house back in the day. Before I ordered it, I looked it up on Sony's website and they stated the game had no problems. Anyway, if anyone out there is playing this on a PS3 comment backThanks"
5,good deal,"We recently purchased this stroller for our 15-month-old daughter and so far everyone loves it. We have used it as a walking stroller and as a bicycle trailer. It is very easy to convert from one mode to another. It is very light weight and was easy to pull behind our bikes. In fact, my husband pulled it behind his bike for part of our ride and midway through we switched it to my bike and I was surprised at how easy it was to pull. Also, it has lots of storage behind the seat. Overall, we are very happy with our purchase."
3,"It's fun, but no multiplayer","It's not bad at all, if ur a fan of road rash id recommend it for a collecters. The only thing I didn't like about this game is that theres no multiplayer.. It's only single player, but its still pretty cool. Some goofy things happen after winning or losing races etc."
3,My brother,"WHen I read this book, I was a little disappointed with a few things. First to know that Marvin Sr. got really no time for commiting murder. Weather of not, Marvin pushed him did not give him any excuse to pull the trigger. I felt that Marvin Sr. was probably jelous of all the attention or that some of his songs were about sex.I honestly thought that Marvin My brother was pretty well written and pretty interesting."
3,Underwhelmed,"Well, I must say that Philip Margolin had a tough act to follow for me. I just finished reading Jo Nesbo's Harry Hole series and was inspired to seek out another well crafted mystery/thriller series. Margolin just doesn't approach Nesbo in the character development department. Parts of Margolin's story were, what's the word?...umm, cliched, would be the diplomatic term. I don't find myself compelled to read anymore of his work."
5,Truley the most chilling!,"This is the best horror book I have ever read, and definitely his best book so far. Shocking and chilling, this book will get you hooked. Anyone who has read a bad horror book should definitely try this one. Wow."
4,CIPA Towing Mirrors,"The CIPA towing mirrors were recommended by my RV dealer. He was right. They have very little vibration and provide excellent visibility around our 26' 5th wheel. The only downside on the mirrors is that the passenger side mirror has too much magnification for my taste. It's very difficult to judge how far a vehicle is behind you. That's not an issue if you don't tend to pass, but with my 2003 GMC Duramax/Allison I put the hammer down and walk right up most hills and frequently pass slower traffic. All in all, I would give these mirrors a B+ rating, better than any other add-on mirror and a whole lot cheaper than aftermarket extended mirrors."
4,ITS GOOD BUT NOT THAT GOOD,This game is fun but the graphics are not that good. It also takes a long time to lode the races. But every other part of it is fun.
2,Decent driving game. No big whoop.,"Need For Speed III Hot Pursuit isn't one of the better looking driving games around. The screen shots look far sexier than the actual gameplay. The driving is really floaty and bogus. The sound effects aren't anything special either. On the upside, pursuit mode is a blast. Unlike GT Interactive's Driver, the cops in NFS3 use intelligent strategy, boxing in the player with multiple units, or forcing him off the road rather than simply ramming with brute force. All in all, this is definately a try-before-you-buy title. Good luck."
1,This album represents the modern Rumbero style of Flamenco.,This album is a rehash of modern Rumbita recordings. It is fairly typical of this style which has little relationship to the traditional Flamenco styles. It would appeal mainly to those whose knowledge of Flamenco is superficial.
4,convenient but not the best...,"I can't understand this. The 'Discovery' is roaming Mars (the planet) and yet to be invented is one small hair dryer that operates with batteries and not this one which uses butane fuel.I bought it and I have used it only once. I am sure the FAA would not allow you to board the plane with this thing. If you need something to straighten your bands in a few seconds, this is the product.If anybody knows about small hair dryers with --batteries---kindly let me know.;)"
4,cordless straightening iron,This iron was purchased for use at ring side dog shows. It takes a few minutes to heat up. When it gets hot it does a great job straightening my Maltese's hair. A drawback would be the butane smell.
1,Don't even bother,"I have a short hair style that cannot be pulled back when needed- such as on a week long camping trip I recently took. I thought I would get this little guy for quick straightening in the morning (I have thin hair that is easily straightened with a normal electric straightener)... however it took about 10 minutes to heat up, and by ""heat up"" I mean get warm. It barely did anything when I did manage to get it turned on. Half the time when attempting to turn the thing on, it would turn on, then the flame would go out with no warning. I was alarmed of this by the smell of the butane filling the tent. I doubt there is enough butane in there to do any damage, but who knows. Not even sure how I can properly dispose of this with the gas. I would avoid getting this straightener- even if you are desperate!"
2,Good Story But A Lot of Bad Language,"I loved how this film showed what it's like for some homeless families. I had a hard time with there being a lot of bad language in it though; I wish I knew when those bad words were coming so I could've plugged my ears. The title of the movie made me think there was going to be clean language, although the film case it was in had a ""not rated"" rating on it, so there was no way of knowing. I guess maybe hearing bad language doesn't bother some people when watching a film, but for me it does and I want to make others aware of it, also. The film did sharpen my senses a lot more on the topic of homelessness, which is why I'm giving it a ""2"" rating and not a ""0""."
3,Where God Left His Shoes,Where God Left His Shoes: Hard to follow a lot of detail left out and the title; Where God Left His Shoes: is misleading.Acting was ok.
3,Lousy Description,"It would be of GREAT HELP if Amazon would name the two movies that are on this DVD. Since Scott made dozens of movies, obviously I am not going to buy it without knowing what I am getting. With all of the other details in the listing, is it too much to give a minimal description of the DVD - at least the movie titles??????"
3,George C. Scott Signature Collection,"What can I say? The word mediocre comes to mind out of a vast library of better George C. Scott movies. These are far from his best or at least what I would consider a Signature Collection. Many of his best aren't even available on DVD. If they want to make me happy they need to put ""The Flim Flam Man"", ""The List of Adrian Messenger"", ""They Might Be Giants"", ""Oklahoma Crude"", ""Rage"" and ""12 Angry Men (1997)"" on Region 1 DVD. If you enjoyed these catch ""Patton"" and ""China Rose"".P.S. Any chance we can tell whoever is holding these up from DVD that George said he would use their living guts to grease his tank treads?CA Luster"
4,Works great,"This is a very good product for someone who has never waxed anything before. This is a very easy microwavable wax for upper lip, chin, and minor eyebox shaping. I am still not very good at using it for major eyebrow shaping, but I use a tweezer for that."
2,Not for me,Took a while to heat up and I felt difficult to remove. I think the cloth strips work better. It only came with one application stick.
5,Eye-Opening,"Piven and Cloward offer an intelligent, yet readable discussion on the downsizing of the American electorate. They claim that having low voter participation helps the controlling factions of the political parties remain unthreatened. They include a history of voter participation and representation in all levels of American politics and the factors that still leave some groups underrepresented today. A very insightful and enjoyable read."
5,Beware. Region 2 DVD Won't Play on most US Players,"Please be aware that this DVD is Region 2 encoded and will not play on most US DVD players which are Region 1. You can buy player which will ignore the region code on Amazon - just search for ""multi region dvd player"".But it is an extermely funny DVD and well worth getting a multi-region player if you are a Billy Connlly fan!"
4,Mostly for Howard fans,"I gotta admit, if I didn't know Artie from the Howard Stern show, I probably wouldn't like this as much as I do. But hearing Artie every day for the last five years, this pretty much exemplifies his greatest quality- being able to tell a funny story about his life.He's not the best comedian around... not by a long shot... But he's a damn funny guy, and he is very open with himself- almost too open, like a flesh wound that you can't take your eyes off of sometimes.I haven't watched the special features yet, but the standup video itself is easily worth the nine bucks that Amazon is asking for, especially if you already a fan of the guy."
1,not Artie's best,"Ordered this a while back, when Artie was on Howard Stern. I couldn't even get through the whole thing. I am a big fan, but I would not recommend this. Beer League was enjoyable, this was painful."
3,"so, so.....","I bought this DVD for my boyfriend who is a big Howard fan. He seemed to enjoy the humor, but he wasn't laughing as much as he expected. I wasn't too amused with it. I have seen better."
4,Pretty Good Game,This is a good moto game for playstation. I think you should get this game because it is really fun. You can also make your own tracks.
3,Buy it ... but as a Dolby 5.1 Audio blu-ray with 20 minutes of Hi- Def 'space' video,"If you appreciate classical music, 'Heavenly Music Blu-Ray', priced under $10.00, is a great buy.AUDIO: The blu-ray audio is in Dolby 5.1 with a run time of almost 8 hours.VIDEO: You are buying just about 20 minutes of video only that is played in a loop as the audio tracks play. Noteworthy, is a three and a half minute long video clip of the launch sequence. It is quite impressive and worth looking out for as the video loops!By all means, add 'A View from Space with Heavenly Music' to your collection ... but, as an Audio blu-ray with just 20 minutes of Hi- Def video. It will make a great Holiday stocking stuffer for those classical music aficionados on your gift list!Despite having 8 hours of high quality audio, I held back 2 STARS for the MUCH TOO SHORT video content.Hope this review was helpful ...Jeffrey A. (Jeff)"
2,Deceiving movie,"Images and videos are, that's true, breathtaking. High-definition from there is gorgeous but it's not 60 minutes of unseen footage, but only 10 minutes in a loop, sometimes with different color filters, so you're buying 10 minutes of space views, amongst which 3' are the liftoff part. Pictures quality is great (taking in account where and how it has been shot) but it's not worth that price."
2,Video Content Length is Short and Quality is Moderate.,Loops the same video at least 4 times (perhaps 10-13 minutes of footage). I saw this footage in a Discover HD documentary about the space station Discovery HD version was stitched together a little bit more nicely and they corrected some of the exposure problems.This footage suffers from occasional exposure control issues as the brightness of the earth changes rapidly from desert to snow/clouds. The footage is frequently unsteady and the windows need to be cleaned on the station.The music is a good collection of freely available classical content. Eight sound tracks at about 55 minutes each. I suspect the video is also freely available open source NASA footage. Music quality is good. video clarity is HD quality.I would have been more satisfied with a price point of about $10 for this content. At nearly $20 the footage length and exposure quality detract from the overall experience significantly.
4,"Good, not great.","Imagery is excellent but repetitious; most scenes are of desert areas and sea. Not much green, no cities, and few recognizable landforms. Music is good, image quality excellent."
5,Battery issues,"I've used mine for a year in all sorts of situations..including on the slopes during a ski trip. Photographic output couldn't be better. I wish it had someway to attach a neck strap like most 35 mm cameras. Shortly after I got it it quit working and I took it to a Kodak service center. Turned out I had shoved the batteries into the compartment too firmly and bent the metal ""leaves"" inside which maintain pressure on the battery. They were ""unbent"" in 2 shakes and all has been well since. The service department STRONGLY recommended using LITHIUM AA batteries like the red-topped Energizers. Since I switched, it's months before I get a low battery reading."
4,"Great Camera, but one flaw","This camera is a great camera. smaller then it looks on the box, but has great flexibility and features built in. Produces excellent quality pictures, the one flaw however that I've noticed is that when taking pictures in doors in a low light level *without* the flash, it tends to blur the image if it's either a motion picture or you move it before it's finished. This only seems to occur without the flash (I was taking horse action pictures and didn't want to scare them) and this seems to dissapear at around 1/90 of a second exposure time. Just thought I'd be critical :) Other then that I find this a great camera!"
5,The Sandlot - American Classic,This movie is forever engrained in my head from watching it so many times as a adolescent. It never fails to make me laugh and put a smile of my face. Great film every American and Baseball fan should watch.
5,This movie was an Instant Classic the day it came out!!!,"This movie is a classic, and I don't think that anyone would disagree with that. There is no movie that could have the sweetness that this movie has. This movie has a ton of comedy, I laughed the whole time, this movie has a little mystery, and a good message of friendship. I've seen this movie so many times, my tape is actually down to nothing now, that's why I have the dvd now, and of course dvd is always better. I promise you this when you purchase this movie you will have made a very wise decision indeed!"
5,Fun Film,"This movie is great for the whole family. I think I first saw this film when I was 10. After watching it, I had a huge crush on Mike Vitar. This was his first movie--and his only major role.The cast is fantastic. The veterans--Karen Allen, Denis Leary, and James Earl Jones--provide something special in this film. (The ""Play Ball"" scene between Leary and Guriy is hilarious!) Anyway, this film is just filled with action, humor, and excitement. If you want to know what the ""biggest pickle"" was in this film... you're just going to have to watch it."
3,wasnt that good,"i dont really have to write along review for this movie, ill jus stick to the point. all i can say is thats is alright...it wasnt the best i seen....if you want something wit better characters and more action check out little Giants."
5,What Does Leonard Maltin Know?,"This movie is GREAT! I just looked for a DVD version and was disappointed to find there was none. Our VHS version has been viewed many, many times. Our third child was to be named Benjamin, or ""Bennie The Jet Rodriquez,"" but she was a girl, much to the disappointment of our 4 year old boy. I love everything about this movie and it is one the adults can enjoy with the kids!"
5,You have to watch it!,"The Sandlot is a great movie. It's about kids on a baseball team. Everbody thinks Scotty Smalls is a dork. But Benny becomes Scotty's friend. They all teach Scotty how to play baseball. At the end, Benny becomes a professional player in the the league. There's Mr. Mertle, who knew the Sultan of Swat, Babe Ruth, George Herman Ruth. A must watch movie."
3,It's alright,"The Sandlot is an alright movie that I loved as a kid. Now days, however, I see the political motivations behind such a movie. It's not realistic in the early 1960s for there to be such a diverse group of children playing together in a suburban neighborhood. Reminds me of the Mighty Ducks (especially the Mighty Ducks II). As if I am supposed to believe that a diverse group of kids could become the national junior team and go on to beat an Icelandic team. Give me a break."
2,Will not stay in place.,Installed the rain guard and the guard would not stay in place. Bowed the rubber seal the window sits in so the window would not raise as easy. Going to buy the ones that stick to the outside of the door.
2,Little Quality with Lots of Options,"We were sold on the many options this phone has; however, we probably won't even be keeping it on account of the low quality.The handsets are as small as my cell phone, very hard to hold, especially if I'm doing something & am relying on leaning it on my shoulder.There is an echo half the time during my conversations. Sometimes it is like a 1-way radio, in that when I'm talking, I can't hear the other person (or even their background).We're quite disappointed."
4,phone,"The uniden cordless phone with dual handsets that I ordered has so far met the requirements for which I purchased it.I needed an additional phone for my bedroom and a phone that I could have beside me while in the living room.The weather is not receptive at the present time to test the phone while in the yard,which was another reason for the purchase."
5,waatch it,"ive purchased two different base units,,,I,d recommend pluging in the base into a surge protector,,,we,ve killed 2 bases,,,the hand sets seem to survior,,,lightning storms seem to love the base units....."
5,This book has Websites for the Attractions listed,I especially like this book because I found it very helpful to plan my RT66 roadtrip through all 8 states because it listed the websites of the attractions. I was able to easily contact many of the places to go via the internet. The book is well written and has very good accurate information on where to go on this famous road. I would highly suggest this book to families with children as the book has many 'kid friendly' places to go with the kids.It even has some pictures of attractions that kids can color to get them even more involved with a memorable vacation. 5 STARS for sure!
2,"What an interesting world, what a boring story","The idea of the world is a very interesting stage but the actual story being told isn't much of a story. The following books aren't much better, skip this series."
5,Luxurious sound,How typical this album is with all the others 2002 has put together - glad this artist has brought this music to light in this day and age - so relaxing and restful - own all of his music and difficult to decide which CD to play first - keep up the great music.
2,Paced too fast,"This is the second book in Michael Moorcock's Chronicles of Corum series. The book continues the adventures of Prince Corum first begun in 'The Knight Of Swords'. In this book Prince Corum travels too a different plane to try and end the hegemony of The Queen of Swords, and thus save his own plane from the forces of Chaos. With him is the eternal companion of Champions,Jhary-a-conel and his winged cat.I don't know if this story was originally written for a magazine format, but it certainly reads like it. This is probably the weakest of the swords trilogy, and like all three books in the sword trilogy, the pace is breakneck. One has no time to appreciate the dangers Corum finds himself in, before he is immediately rescued and moved on to the next predicament."
3,"Engrossing, but not what I'd expected","Mr. Klaber's book is well-written, engrossing, and thought-provoking. At its core, however, it is less about what the common reader thinks of as the ""case"" of the RFK murder than it is centered strongly on the legal proceedings themselves. He brings out tantalizing bits of evidence, but does not follow any of them to their end points. In the end, while being more fully aware of the possibility of Sirhan's innocence, the reader has little to go on in terms of discovering the real perpetrator(s) or the second gunman."
1,Steamy eroticism is NOT romance!!!,"The sex in this book is the steamiest I've ever seen. . . and I've read Bertrice Small and Susan Johnson! But the word ""love"" is only mentioned on the last page; the rest of the book is pervaded by a desire by both parties to enslave the other with lust (the title is an apt one). The characters are admitted adventurers, both USING the other--she needs him to find the priceless diamond, he needs her for eyes when he is mysteriously blind. The plot is thinly devised to bind the sex scenes together. . . I found myself skipping through from sex scene to sex scene to see what new perversion comes to light. . . like an adolescent reading a dirty book! Needless to say, this book is NOT a keeper!"
2,Desire Bound Where?,"I have read many historical romances and this is one I wouldn't recommend. I picked it up just because of the name Thea Devine, but was disappointed. I had a hard time finishing it. It could have been good, their ""adventure"" spans the middle east, including India and Russia but it felt empty. The ""adventure"" was stupid. The characters were empty also. Lots of ""love making"" but the scenes were written poorly, usually rushed and without sensuality. Try another Thea Devine book is all I really have to say."
5,An old favorite,I read this book back in middle school and had always wanted to reread it. A nice easy read that's still entertaining after all these years.
1,holy crap,"I watched this show when i was little and decided why not watch it now that i'm older. I got through 3 episodes and turned it off. The shows themselves are animated ok but the voices of the characters and the plots behind the episodes can only be described as excruciatingly painful. I mean the 2nd or 3rd episode had some ""ninja koopa"" theme. That has absolutely nothing to do with super mario brothers 3. The shows are good for a laugh but don't plan on sitting down for a marathon and watching all of them. By the end of the second episode you'll need a break to let your brain recover."
1,not a game,thought it was a game not what i wanted.so i gave it to my friend for the kids they loved it
5,Great.,Ignore old reviews about this being out of date -- apparently they keep the old reviews around when they update the book!
4,Completely unique!,"bought these socks for my housemate who has a pet jack russell. Very hard to find and he absolutely loved them. Expensive though for a pair of socks and when i ordered them , i thought it was worth it because of their uniqueness but when they were delivered, i noticed that the paw prints on the sock did come a tiny bit smudged so maybe the price shouldve been a bit lower!! My housemate still loves them though!"
5,Second only to Final Fantasy 7,"One of square's bestand very underappriciated, the best Fighters game out, the quest mode has a great battle system(it could use a little better story line though)"
4,Bought for my sister,I bought this for my sister who was battling ovarian cancer. She thought that it gave her good information about ovarian cancer and her illness
4,Best guided relaxation source I ever had.,"I have several guided meditation tapes, CDs and videos but none have ever taken me so deeply within my Self as this one.The background chanting and oriental music was a pleasant surprise."
3,Worked for a while. Died like the first camera.,"I just have to believe there is a fundamental flaw with these cameras. They look good, work great for a while, and seem indestructible. But even with careful use under lab conditions, the camera seems to just burn itself out. I have a couple of these door stops now, and I bet I couldn't get one good one from the two. Not the sellers fault, as it arrived in working condition. These just aren't good cameras IMHO."
2,Shame on U2,"When I purchased this CD way back when, I thought it was incredible although short. Now that the internet has come along, I downloaded the COMPLETE concert, and now I know what everyone has been missing, over 90 minutes of a really incredible concert. The ""commercial"" version is a rip-off to fans. Gloria, which opens the commercial CD, actually was the 14th song of the set. I always thought ""40"" was a great closing song. Now that I have the full concert, I found out that there were two additional songs played. To end my spiel, seek out the complete concert and you will be amased at what you have been missing."
3,Wiggly red lines are distracting,"Although, I agree with the overall sentiment, the picture quality is quite bad. I can't believe that the film has become this damaged in less than 30 years. Red lines that look much like someone took a red marker to the DVD picture, are present throughout the entire concert. They are most noticable on close up shots of Bono and The Edge. They were not on the orginal version and it is too bad Island did not come clean with this fact before releasing it to DVD. Maybe I have a defective copy. But I checked a couple of versions posted on the internet and the lines show up there as well.Having said this, ""Under a Blood Red Sky"" put U2 on the map and this landmark show is still worth owning. What it lacks in picture quality is made up in the new stereo mix and Surround Sound addition."
3,Good,"This album was my introduction to U2 many years ago and I've been a U2 fan ever since. Even though I'm not a big fan of live albums I think this one captures the essence of U2's early years. My only complaint is the short song selection. For those who have U2's early albums perharps the best treat here is the 2 non-album tracks 11 O'clock Tick Tock and Party Girl. For those who don't have those early albums this is a nice compilation of the very basics. In some cases I actually like the live versions better than the studio ones, such as in 40 and particularly Gloria. I would give this album ***1/2 but that's not possible."
5,Great Live,"Other than being a bit short, this album gives a great glimpse of the early, exciting Live U2. Most of these readings are more energetic than the studio ones(and those weren't too shabby, either:) This is arguably more fun than any of their studio albums, and not even a bad place to start with them."
2,poor quality,"Poorly constructed and finished. Everything about these lights, including that weird smell so many of these Chinese made products have (like a weird chemical smell), points to cheaply made and mass produced. I ended up using this inside my workshop instead, it was too shameful to put on display."
2,Accurate but delicate,"This scale is very nice to hold and appears to be built very well. It is certainly an attractive scale. I was able to use it two times before it stopped working. Those two times were pleasant enough. I picked it back up from where it had been sitting for a couple of weeks and it would not turn on. I purchased a new battery for it and it still will not turn on. It has had no impact, the luggage that I weighed were each less than fourty pounds and it has never been around moisture in its short life of service.If I was moving somwhere and knew that I was just going to throw away the scale when before I took off, I'd purchase another one. Otherwise I'll go for something a bit longer lasting."
2,could have been better,The ramp part seems to be to steep for my boys to use. We have tried to use it with scooters and bikes with no luck.
3,needs to be bolted in,"this took a little work, needs to be bolted into the area you will use it on. It is a bit more than I was hoping for."
1,CHEAP!!!,I understand that the cost of this item is low but the ramp is useless. My son is 8 and he can't even use it. It is so flimsy and weak not worth the money.
3,"""Surprise!""","When I received this set I was quite surprised. The ramp is MUCH much smaller than I was hoping for. I comforted myself by thinking ""at least the kids won't get hurt as bad"". As it turns out, my 2 boys aren't even using the ramp. They do, however, really enjoy the rail (which is small but sufficient for now)."
1,Bummer,Do not waste your money. This was bought for my son as a Christmas gift and was a total let down. Save your money! This thing is a joke!
4,Razor Punk Park Ramp and Rail Combo Set Review,"Razor Punk Park Ramp And Rail Combo SetPurchased this item as a Christmas Gift for my grandson. He was completely satisfied with the item, as it matched his desires perfectly."
1,yuck,my son hated this product. kids will try it once and they will not want to take it again. you cannot hide it in other drinks it is too strong to do that. I didn't see any improvement in his sleep habits either.
3,What happened?,"I was a big Fear Factory fan since I heard for the first time ""Zero Signal"" song on Mortal Kombat soundtrack. My favorite cd will always be Obsolete, then Archetype after that Demanufacture. I don't know what happened with this cd, first 4 tracks and preety good and then it's gets boring and slow.Horrible Trax: Supernova, New Promise, I Will FollowPlease stop making cover songs, I don't wanna hear FF (a metal band) playing some Rock songs that's just terrible. I thought after putting that CARS track on Obsolete DIGI-Pack Fear Factory would learn not to make another same mistake. I hope next cd whenever it comes out will be strong and powerfull like Archetype."
1,ENOUGH W/ CHANGE!!!!,"I dont know what the big deal is w/ people wanting to have a different sound on each of their albums. When i pick up a FF album i want to hear the FF from demanufacture, their best album. Why is it so important for FF to veer away from this sound, I thought the world was right again w/ Archetype. So when i listened to Transgression, I was very disappointed. Oi this album is terrible, more so than digimortal! If people want a different sound, then listen to a different band, there's millions out there."
1,"Paid for year subscription, got two issues.",I paid for a years subscription through amazon and got two issues. I haven't received anything for three months. Now I have the fun task of figuring out what happened! I love this magazine but will go back to purchasing it at a newsstand.
3,Disappointed,I was so dissappointed when my parcel arrived. The book is ok but not the size I was expecting for the price I paid.... it was so small. Then I noticed a price tag in the back saying it was $14.95 retail price in the US. I paid $62.95 Australian (this included $12.95 postage ) so I must say I feel very ripped off
2,disappointing collection,"The book contains a large number of black and white reproductions of various demon and devil imagery in comics. One sample per random artist, generally. The images, many poorly reproduced, low contrast, and small, appear on one page faced by a paragraph or two of commentary.I found the images to be largely uninteresting. Banal. And the commentary flat and superficial."
5,Their best release to date!,"This is by far Primal Fear's best album followed by Nuclear Fire, Black Sun, Primal Fear and Jaws of Death (in that order).The production is perfect as always, killer riffs, great melodies, unbelievable drums, and of course Ralf's powerful voice.This is my score for each track:Metal Is Forever 10/10Suicide and Mania 10/10Vision of Fate 9/10Sea of Flames 9/10The Healer 11/10 (their best ballad so far!)Sacred Illusions 11/10 (their best track so far!)In Metal 9/10Soulchaser 9/10Colony 13 10/10Wings of Desire 9.5/10Heart of The Brave 9.5/10Devil's Ground (no quote cause its just a guy talking about hell)Overall 10/10 Buy or Die!"
3,No subtitles,"Even though it is stated on the outside of the box that the DVD has subtitles, it DOES NOT. You can pick the spoken language between English and Spanish, but there are NO SUBTITLES available. This was a huge disappointment to me, being that the only reason I bought this version was for the subtitles. So, if that is why you're buying this, DON'T!"
1,Photograph is misleading.,This bag is SO SMALL. I bought this bag thinking that I could carry my daughters' beach toys in it and nothing fits. I can't even imagine someone putting laundry in it as the advertisement says. The only reason I gave it one star is now my 3 year old daughter is carrying it around as a purse and puts her stuffed animal in it...that's how small the bag is! Not worth the money. I would have been disappointed even if I found this at the dollar store. Do not buy...don't waste your money.
4,Nice Bag,"This is a nice mesh bag that will service for many years. The only thing I would have done differently is the way the handles are attached. It's not exactly like the picture and would have been easier to open if placed differently on the bag. However, overall, I like the quality and size of the bag."
2,Should have gone down with the Titanic!!!!,"This is without a doubt D.S. most boring novel of all!!! Very hard to follow, it tells way too much about the Titanic. If I wanted to know about the Titanic, I'll get the real book!"
3,Typical and predictable Steel novel.,"This is the sixth Danielle Steel novel I have read. I can only handle one or two a year since they all seem to be very much the same, even though they are enjoyable and are page-turners. However, No Greater Love is by far the weakest and slowest one I have read. Except for the first one hundred pages and the last fifty it really isn't all that interesting and actually the ""San Fransisco years"" which is the bulk of the novel are just plain boring. Edwina makes an okay heroine, but Alexis is a pain from the start to the finish and I couldn't stand her character. Overall, it's a decent Steel novel--not her best, but I'm sure not her worst either."
5,A must read on Tokyo and Life in Japan,"This book is a must read for anyone interested in life in general in Japan. I loved every bit of it and enjoyed the strange but interesting truth about life in Japan. Author adopts Tokyo as his home and learns to love what he got there and forget about what he missed there. I grew up in Asia and live in the US and have been to Japan and his comparison of living there as opposed to US is astonishingly honest and truthful. He writes beautifully about the issue of space, culture, and everyday etiquette, cross between the industrial and the rural Japan like a storyteller. If you are someone who grew up outside Japan and are going to live there, you must read this. If you also want to know what life in general in Japan is, this is a great book. Author is trying not only to live there and raise his family but also to love the place he chose to live in. Lively, entertaining book."
4,Great CD!,"Other than the fact that it could have provided the lyrics, this cd is a hit in our home and car. My son (9 years of age) simply loves it!"
2,disappointed,The beat varied so much from the original version that the kids didn't really recognize some of their favorite christian songs. They haven't wanted to listen to this cd at all.
1,Don't Bother,"This is a very poorly done dvd, don't waste your money. First of all, the introduction, music and credits are repeated many times, at the beginning of each section, to the point that it's annoying. The background music is very loud, and at times drowns out the commentary. The dvd length is about 45 minutes, and on the cover it states ""approximately 90 min"". The information presented has been covered many times in other films, with just a little different twist, so really no new information is presented. There is an ""evidence"" section of the dvd- I was interested to watch that- and it was a joke, it showed a document that couldn't be read, and a picture of the Texas School Book Depository. I have other dvd's about the Kennedy assassination, all of them are much better that this one."
4,A fathers love,This little girl is doubtful of her father's love. This book is good to read for thoose who are interested in the bonds of a family.
5,Great album- great band,"Definately give this album a try- especially with summer approaching. This is pure roll-down-your-windows and crank out feel-good music while driving down the interstate. Although it not- surpringly lacks hits, you won't be disappointed.Chad Koenig"
5,Major Lodge Victory,"The CD is amazing! There are so many songs that I can identify with... just stuff about life. Very perceptive and insightful lyrics and beautiful harmony. I can't get enough of this CD! There's a song on there called Jet Black Sunrise. I heard it was written by the bass player, Bill. It's my favorite on the CD. The only thing I'd add to make it better is Scott Johnson's ""Stop"" which I heard got bumped off. It would've added some variety to the general sound, but all in all, worth every penny!"
2,"tips to enjoying ""major lodge victory""","1. steal it2. delete every song except the first 3. if you feel cheated, you can keep number 4.3. listen to these awesome songs over and over. do NOT listen to the rest. ignorance is bliss."
5,2 year olds favorite book!,"Upon looking at this book it looks too simple to be entertaining, but my 2 year old daughter loves it! It's become her favorite book."
1,bad aftertaste,"I really wanted this to be yummy. I love lobster bisque. However, there was very little lobster. ALso, it tasted medicine-y and had an after taste, Very disappointing."
3,No Blu Ray?,"How can they offer Season 2 in Blu Ray, but not Season 3? That just seems backwards to me. I know the show is shot in 16mm and not HD, but I definitely noticed the difference between Season 1 (DVD) and Season 2 (Blu Ray). I dig this show, but I can't buy the third set if it's not available in Blu Ray after enjoying Season 2 in that format. As for the show jumping the shark, I don't see that at all. This show still has it. Now that The Shield is over, this is my favorite show currently airing on TV. Keep up the good work!"
5,Burn Notice,Burn Notice is one of the best shows there is. I have all seasons and will continue to get them.
5,Addictive!,"I would never promote drug usage of any sort, but this show is media crack! They lure in the audience with their superb storylines, witty banter, romantic teasing, and ""how-to tips."" The chemistry between the cast and the way they outsmart the bad guys...priceless. Throw in some interesting clients and wacky side-kicks and you're hooked. I started watching the show during it's third season. After viewing a couple of episodes during a marathon one day, I found myself out purchasing seasons 1 and 2 DVDs. I fell in love. In season 3, you will see how the characters have developed and genuinely love each through thick and thin. Now, I'm going through withdrawals waiting for the remainder of season 3 to return in January 2010. What can I say? I'm addicted. This IS must see T.V."
4,"warm, intreguing, sensual to the point, beautifully descibed","This was the first i have read of Ms. Madl's writings, very well done. I was most impressed with history of the time, the sensitivity of the characters and the family ties. I would be very eager to read other books by her. I only would have like to know the outcome of Gray Glen and Forbes."
2,terrible the history of a lie,"This is nothing short then the history of a fabrication, which is to say the history of the Deir Yassin 'massacre' in which less then 100 Jordanian-arabs were killed in battle with the Haganah in 1948, all of those killed were combatants, killed with weapons in their hands or close by. This book ignores the truth and ignores many other facts sourounding the unfortunate event. This book sadly, and regrettably, completely ignores the similar massacres of the Etzion Block where 100s of Jewish civilians were also murdered. Hopefully a second edition of this work will carry the name 'twin massacres' Dier Yassin and The Etzion Block. But until then this book will be a biased account of a controversial episode, one that has been blown out of all proportion."
5,The Lewton touch.,"Karloff did three great movies for producer Val Lewton in the mid-40's; and while ""Isle"" may not be the best of them, it's probably the creepiest. Especially the famous ""resurrection"" scene comes to mind. I dare you to watch the last 10 minutes of the film with all the lights out, and you won't forget it for a long time. -Those drops of water hitting that coffin, the sobbing and the subsequent ""walk of terror"" around the house will stay with you, I gaurantee. The story is not very logical, but it's scary and that's what counts. Lewton was indeed the true Master of atmosphere."
5,Val Lewton Masterpiece,"All of Val Lewton's RKO horror films should be available of DVD; one by one, however, they have gone out of print. This is one of the few that's left on VHS; buy it immediately. While not as effective as THE SEVENTH VICTIM or I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, this is a superb film that deserves to be seen as widely as possible.When is RKO going to put out a complete boxed set of Val Lewton films on DVD? It's long overdue."
5,"ISLE OF THE DEAD- BORIS KARLOFF, KATHERINE EMERY","Very possibly Val Lewton's and Boris Karloff's scariest horror film. A group of people are stranded on a greek isle during the war of 1912, due to a deadly epidemic or plague. Those who catch it will die, but the symptoms are mistakenly confused by a belief that an evil wolflike spirit called the ""Vorvolaka"" possesses its victims until it drains them of their strength and blood. Katherine Emery is brilliant as a cataleptic who returns from the grave to avenge herself of those who mistakenly buried her alive! Caution: this film can give you nightmares even decades after watching it!"
5,ken boire author of Inherit the Tide,"Alexie has generated some top notch writing. ""Ten Little Indians"" is right up there with others. He tends to do variations of the same themes, but isn't this what most present day writers do? I sort of expect it. I would be somewhat amazed if the top fiction writers of 2006 turned out something outside of their usual pattern. Read the first Grisham, Follet, Roberts, Patterson, Clancy, etc and by the time you read down each list a bit, you will think the writer had some kind of a universal outline.At least in the case of Alexie there is value in his courage and the insight he offers. One expects the voice of a present day urban Indian, and we get it. Sherman steps to the plate. One feels the pain, frustration, and distrust. It is wrapped around pride with a beating heart.I liked ""Ten Little Indians"", I read parts of it twice. I put it on the shelf to read again later."
5,Not commonly available but useful,"I have a Danby portable dishwasher that requires dishwasher salt. I've never owned a dishwasher that required this before. It isn't commonly available in stores so I'm glad to see that Amazon carries it. I would like to say it makes my dishes come out cleaner, but I'm not sure what its effectiveness truly is. Either way, my dishwasher requires it and I no longer need to look at a flashing red light which asks me to add salt."
2,"I guess unlocked means used, not warrenty, disappointment","I received this as a gift (after some hinting) but was really disappointed to see that it was clearly used, the plates didnt match, and no warrenty. I spent a half hour just cleaing it off. I would not buy antother one."
1,Unregistered SIM / check SIM,"Received phone, inserted working 3g SIM. Got unregistered SIM error, check SIM. Phone is available for emergency calls only. In process of RMAing the damn thing!Once burned, now reluctant to try this route for replacement phone. (Wife will need to learn to not drop phone in toilet!) Back to using $29 no contract phone for near future."
3,Great phone Camera is useless!,"We purchased A motorola V3 gsm Razor phone for or trip to Turkey and Greece. The phone did not work in Turkey but it did in Greece, so I believe it was the service and not the phone. My complaint is the camera. After documenting our trip with the camera, we now find we unable to down load the pictures without purchasing,at additional cost, software and USB cable from Motorola. Ridiculous!"
2,review,"I love razor phones, this is my 7th razor. but this one has no signal, i spend more time chasing a signal, where my other razors got a great signal. on this one, my 9 button sticks. so i spend alot of time going back to fix my words while im texting. but i will buy another razor. 6 good ones out of 7 aint bad."
2,Dont like Razor Phones,"The front and back color didn't match, Looked like a cheaply made phone. I dont think I got the same phone that was shown, I payed way to much.ppl or giving these phones away. Dont recommend this seller or phone"
1,"not worth the cost for the ""rmx""","Guess what? The remix is two minutes and 47 seconds long! It almost feels like it wants to be a house mix, but it's not--it's just a less rhythmic mix than the original, with a steadier beat. Unless you are a diehard fan, don't bother with this one."
2,There's Doubt!,"This is unquestionably one of the STUPIDEST songs that has ever hit the top 40, but yet I have to give it more than one star. It's SO absolutely ignorant (I still don't get the bit about Bananas) and ridiculous that it has a strange appeal. You don't WANT to like this admittedly dumb song, but it's catchy in an odd way and difficult to resist the chanting and the beat.Clearly inspired by the chanting of African-American college stepshows and marching bands, listeners who are familiar with those styles will wink at being in on an inside joke of sorts. You will find yourself wanting to make like a frisbee or target practice with this enhanced CD, but something strange will keep you from doing so. Why? I guess the same reason that groups like Freddie and the Dreamers and the Fat Boys bring smiles to those who recall their music. Dumb music that's so bad it's good will always have its place."
2,A passer-uper,"As much as I hate to say ""passer-uper"" i have to for this movie. Unless you are a absolutly obsessed with Sci-fi movies i suggest you not see this movie . I wasted my life siting and watching this movie and you might feel the same way"
2,Special treat for Lambert fans,"Typical B-movie sci-fi junk. Fans of Christopher Lambert (pronounced: LamBARE) take note: during a love scene, the viewer is treated to a clear shot of Lambert's balls."
4,Applications run smoothly.,"I bought Virtual PC 5 with Dos becasue I own several versions of Windows from 95 to XP, why pay the extra money? However loading your own OS was not as easy as hoped. However, once I figured it out (thanks to the help menus), I decide on windows 98SE, xp aparrently runs slower due to the OS being larger and 95 doesn't support USB. It runs MS office nicely and even Frontpage 2000. Don't try any games, this is not for that. If you need to run PC programs on your mac this is a great deal for a hundred bucks."
4,Does what it says,"This product contains ""Magnesium hydroxide, Cape Aloe leaf, Rhubarb root, Slippery Elm bark, Marshmallow root,and Triphala (blend of Amalaki, Bibhitaki, and Haritaki)"", according to the company's website.The ""natural"" compounds, along with the magnesium, do what it says,and taken with a fiber supplement, like ""Sundawn Naturals Colon Cleanser"", works great."
5,Great product!,"I use CleanseMore when I need to and it works great with no cramping. Also, I had questions about the product, and the answers were right there on the side of the bottle--the label gives good instructions for usage, and how not to use it."
5,Relax with a Genius,"Smooth touch, deft phrasing, and a Fourth of July of harmonic invention. Like Tatum at his best, Kellaway stays good humored and fun while flinging dazzling ideas at evert turn. It's like a conversation with a fascinating friend."
3,Family ties,"This book promised to be a family pastoral, with all the requisite stock characters of a dysfunctional family...You have the eldest daughter who was the apple of her father's eyes but lands in jail for an art theft; the ne'er do well son who is engaged to a European bombshell he is vaguely in love with, and who suddenly finds himself taking on the role of the responsible one in the family; the youngest and the runt of the family who fashions herself as a punkish Bridget Jones, with nose-ring and a drug habit, who sleeps with her boss; the mother who oversees the disintegration of her family and the deterioration of her husband, etc etc... all gearing towards the climactic reunion and a wedding at the end, almost hollywoodish in its idealism...At times humorous, but just missing the mark with the attempts to capture quick-witted moments in its suddenly short exchanges between the characters - the effect is that of uneven writing... quite a letdown..."
2,"Arid, could not finish","The plot is not so much a plot as a situation that gets chewed over and over and OVER and the characters collections of traits relentlessly described by the author --JuJu's brilliance, dad's creepy melancholia, mom's low self-esteem -- but not really coming to life as individuals. In fact, they remained so undifferentiated it was often difficult to tell who was speaking during the meandering patches of dialog. The bathos-laden ruminations on Art, History, and the Meaning of Americanism were truly cringe-making, and I couldn't tell if the author intended them to be taken seriously or was demonstrating how sophomoric JuJu & co. actually were. I admit I only made it halfway through the book. In light of the glowing reviews, I can only assume it does a brilliant turn-around and out-performs Tolstoy on the home stretch. But after reading the first claustrophobic half, I was desperate for air and willing to break any number of Tiffany windows to make my escape."
5,In Depth Look,"This is the kind of book to read and reread. There were times while reading it that I felt the Lord touch my spirit. It is a wonderful book to be able to ""name"" something that you might not of been able to in the past. I am going to read it a second time and take the wisdom given. This book is not just about the Spirit of God but many things of your own spirit. I highly recommend it!"
2,Nice but not nice enough,"I bought this phone because I was disappointed with AT&T 9370 (to much noise). This phone has about half the range as my AT&T 9401, and about 20% less sound quality. This phone has gotten good reviews else where, but I was disappointed. If I could have gotten the AT&T 9401 with the answering machine, I would gladly paid $150. I have no complaints about the answering machine. I would not buy this phone (or the AT&T 9370) again."
3,"Ok, but not great","This phone has lots of great features: one base unit, up to 4 handsets. The base unit charges an extra battery, and will also run off the battery if power fails. Speakerphone in handset. Phone to phone intercom. 3 mail boxes. But it's missing in some basic areas: phone book entries can't be edited, only deleted. The digital answering maching recording quality is just terrible. I often have to listen to a message several times to understand it. Messages cannot be accessed from the handset. It's saving grace is that it's fairly inexpensive compared to it's competitors. It's a good phone, but not perfect."
2,Range Is Weak,"Features seem good. Range however is less than my current Panasonic 2.4Ghz. The base transmitter signal seems weaker than that of my current Panasonic (which comes with ""range extend). The phone was returned."
1,Don't Buy This Phone - Spend the $$$ for the Panasonic,This phone has a ton of great features...if only i could hear the person I'm talking too. Something a $... phone can accomplish. It sounds horrible..all you here is SSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.Don't buy it. At all...not even to try it out...it's garbage. Spend the money and get the Panasonic KX-TG2730S and an extra Handset KX-TGA270S. This phone is the best there is...all the features you want and more...and its clear as a bell. No problems with wireless networks either. It costs the most but its worth it just not to have to return all the other junk phones out there.
1,Don't get this model VTech,"We have used VTech phones for years with excellent performance. However, this model/unit was a terrible disappointment. The answering machine base unit failed within 1 month after purchase. The handset is not compatible with other VT2400 series model base units, so we can't use it with our other base. Go ahead and get a VTech system, just not this one."
2,Worked OK for a year then broke.,This phone worked well for a year before the base station and answering machine went out. The phone is difficult to balance on the shoulder. It has a number of nice features including the in-handset speakerphone. The voice quality is fair at best.
3,"Nice feature set, but poor sound quality - don't spend the $","I love the feature set for this phone. It solved one problem for me, but caused another. I have a big, old house with one phone jack.I bought a base unit and two additional handsets for a lot of money which I thought expensive, but ok if it really performed. The setup was trivial - plug and play but the sound quality was poor. EVERYONE who called thought they had dialed our cell phone by mistake. The audio is digitized, and it sounds that way.Sadly, I am returning the whole thing.For this amount of money the audio quality should be perfect."
3,decent stab,"The author makes a decent stab at novelizing Xenophon's historic work in this book. He did it better than I would have done. But, maybe not as well as he could have done, based on some of his other books I have read such as the one about Mithradates which seemed much more compelling to me.Nevertheless, I much enjoyed this work, partly because I am a person of Lakonic ancestry. Perhaps also because I am an American and this book well illustrated the topography and social difficulties of war in the middle east, and how the place has lent itself to guerilla warfare for millenia."
2,Falls short of promise,"The first third is captivating and well-written, the middle third begins to lag, and the final third is a bit tiresome. The ending really let me down."
2,One word - Monotonous,"I bought this book because someone compared it to the absolutely outstanding ""Gates of Fire"" by Stephen Pressfield. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. Although the book is fairly well written, the story itself drags on and on with seemingly little purpose. Xenophon and his troops encounter one obstacle after another on their trek home, but each obstacle is exactly the same as the previous one; only the locations and opponents have changed. Needless to say, this gets old rather quickly. The ""surprise"" ending is both anticlimactic and irrelevant, leading one to wonder whether it was employed simply because the writer knew the story was about to fizzle out and needed to try to salvage it somehow. I could not put down ""Gates of Fire."" To the contrary, I could not pick up ""The Ten Thousand."""
5,Outstanding Historical Fiction,"Clearly, Ford has done his research and gives the reader a wonderful story to read as well as a glimpse into the life of the professional soldier. His descriptions of the rough terrain of Persia and Ionia, as well as his familiarity with ancient Greek language and culture, makes this book a great addition to anyone's library. It is that great rarity--a book you can read anywhere without feeling guilty because you haven't put your brain in gear. I actually read it on the stairmaster and underlined the great passages later! For folks who are interested in the cultures and campaigns of the ancient world as well as aficionados of classical literature, this book is well worth the read!Also recommended: Gates of Fire by Steven Pressfield Tides of War by Steven Pressfield Last of the Amazons by Steven Pressfield The Iliad by Homer The Odyssey by Homer The Greek Myths by Robert Graves"
3,It was just ok.,"This book was like a movie you watch and immediately forget about. I don't regret spending the time reading it, but I didn't really come away with something I would remember or recommend."
4,good read,As a fan of history I enjoyed this book. It was interesting to know what life was like for a Greek Hoplite on campaign.The battle scenes are done well as are the characterizations. I never realized how much rivalry there was in the Greek city states. The Spartans were incredibly different from the other peoples of Greece and it shows in this book. The things these men had to undergo in the deserts of Persia fighting is amazing that any of them returned home. A great read for people interested in historical fiction.
1,Ancient Book of Bad Advice,"This book was published in 1985, and most of the research in it is more than 30 years old! As if that wasn't bad enough, it's by two women whose only stated qualifications is that they're moms who are married to pediatricians- !!! -- and advises some practices that we now know are not healthy, such as stomach sleeping and giving 4-month-olds bottles of glucose water overnight. Leave this relic in the attic!"
1,helping your child sleep through the night,"I bought this book based on the other customer comments. It is not the book for me and my four month old. This book has not been updated since 1985 and recommends that the safest position for baby to sleep is on their stomachs! It also discourages co-sleeping or baby sleeping in the same room with you. The authors start ""the program"" at about 5 -7 weeks; which in my short experience is too early to get your little angel on any kind of ""stretching"" schedule. If you read Dr. Sears or Penelope Leach, you probably won't like this book either."
2,eden for some,"this book makes a point and drives it home over and over (and over) again. While it was a stunning revelation that restricted communities were actually the norm during the first half of the 20th century, rather than the exception, the author pounded it home without speaking about the repercussions of such covenants: Inner cities destroyed, ghettoization, crime, and life in the burbs turned out to be a dubious gift, at best. America is now plagued with obesity, depression, pollution, and all around stupidity, because of moving people so far apart from each other and the services they need to live.This author could have well spent more time looking at the bigger picture, rather than beating us with one fact."
5,red boots for christmas dvd,"I got this movie for my 4 year old son and I felt it really accurately captured what the true meaning of Christmas should be in a way a young child can understand. It is truly a keeper and a great choice among the so many other secular videos available. We've watched it together many times. The length is perfect, just long enough to hold his attention and the content is excellent. This movie should definitely be a part of every Christian's Christmas movie collection."
4,price to high,Dear Amazon- I just bought this same saw from lowes home improvement for $250.00. I dont know why your price is so high. Normaly Amazon has the best price offered anywhere. So why the high price?
4,Now's your chance! Two for less than the price of one!,"Connectix is offering a limited time free (minimal cost for downloading or getting a mailed copy) upgrade from Virtual PC 5 to Virtual PC 6 on their website to recent (like now) purchasers of version 5.Without this deal, version 6 costs MUCH more, even for just the upgrade.From the reviews I've been reading of VPC 6, it solves most of the OSX problems of version 5, especially the speed. So it you are like me, and have been putting off upgrading because of the flaws in version 5, now's the chance to go for it. I just bought VPC 5 here to upgrade from it on the website, saving a bundle in the process.Read the reviews, check the Connectix website for details, and make your choice. Don't wait too long. You have to have version 5 to upgrade to version 6. Buy it now and get two upgrades for less than the price of one!"
1,scared pup,"my dog hates having his nails cut, thought this would be good but it splinter the nail and makes the experience for the pup awful."
4,This is great for tiny hands only!!,"Got those, baby siscors like clipper, is only wonderful if you have tiny hands, & fingers.With this said, Clipper really has great control, & you can becareful with tiny pup.Not as intimidating as other bigger, & scarier clippers.Pup less likely to freak out, your less likely to make a mistake with fragile quick.And that makes, you feel better, & your pup more secure, in your hands.However so much more better, for partner to assist, By holding pup steady while you attempt to cut pup's nails.& a competent one, is highly suggested.Pup will feel more safe, & you, & your partner can use it as bonding moment with the pup.Good luck, & remember be patient, & then things should go smoothly, without splitting.- Lov BB"
4,Good product,"This is a very good product. It goes on easy, dries quickly and has, so far, been durable.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because if its tendancy to foam and leave behind little white bubbles. This came from wiping the excess from the brush on the side of the can, not from shaking. Just be careful to smooth those out and you will have a nice result.Also, I ordered Semi-Gloss, but received Satin. I used it anyway and it looks fine, just not quite the finish I wanted."
3,good driving music,"this is super fast punk/hardcore that sounds better as you drive fast(doesnt sound as well sitting stationary in front of a computer),i like the short song idea and theyre fast,maybe a little too fast but lyrically,its drugs and car themed and these guys seem pretty knowledgable about both.im more of a melody driven guy,-supersuckers ,ramomes,older 70s punk and this a tad too fast for me but ill give it a few more listens"
5,Samuel Pepys and the Fire,"The world's first diarist, Samuel Pepys, may have been the first to write about this defining urban disaster and he is here in this clear, fast-paced account. Meticulous in detail, delivered in great condition and offered at just the right price, ""By Permission of Heaven"" is a bargain."
4,Dig it!,"This is my first Mavericks album so I wasn't sure what to expect.... so I must say I'm very impressed.The closest thing I could say is that it kind of sounds like Roy Orbison if he were still alive and making modern music. It's got that kind of country/rockabilly/beautiful voice, good American music, vibe to it.Very good stuff.... Raul Malo should change his name to Raul Bueno!"
5,Bought it as a secondary,"Ok, so I bought it because it come on a special with the ""Los Lonely Boy"". The first rack cought me and I can't get it out of my player. I am new to these guys. They are awsome!Great vocals, and arrangements. Clearly Roy Orbison's influence stands out with the sophistication of an Elvis delivery. This stuff is great and if you guys in the northeast want someting to listen to other then classic rock or what ever the comtemporary flavor is, this and the Los Lonely boys are a must, you won't be dissapointed."
5,great product,"i use this soap for clothing that should be done by hand- it is gentle, smells good in a subtle way, and is easy to get the suds out. we also used it on our cat for fleas- worked beautifully. my daughter uses it to clean the bathroom- it cuts through soap scum. its my go-to soap when i need a gentle soap that works- and again- the suds are super easy to rinse out."
5,Fantastic Cimbalom music by a premier artist,"Having had the privilege of hearing Kalman Balough perform in a live informal setting, I was unable to resist purchasing this album. Cimbalom music is quite unusual, being a struck instrument, and Kalman is absolutely wonderful. Hungarian folk music is represented here by one of the best!"
2,Simplified and remote,"Short, sharp writing ... the only poetry is in the title!US internment camp for Japanese during WW2I didn't enjoy this near as much The Buddha In The Attic and I'm glad that I read that one first. (Chronologically, the author wrote When The Emperor Was Divine first ... but the time period it is about comes after The Buddha In The Attic).The impact of WW2 on US Japanese citizens was harsh. Families were broken up and moved into camps. This is written though the eyes of one family ... and mainly through the eyes of the children.At times I felt that this allowed the author to get away with painting the picture with a broad brush and skimping on historical detail. It has the same randomness of style that I enjoyed in TBITA but in this I found it simplified the information and made its delivery inconsistent."
2,boring,I read the book for my book club - I found it boring and long - even though it is a short book. Nothing really happens.
4,"Sad story, but inspired by the overcoming of difficulties.",Well written. A voice of those who were ignored or lost. I recommend this to all interested in American history.
2,When the Emperor Was Divine,"I read it because it will be presented at our Book and Author luncheon this month, but I really did not like it much. I liked a book called ""On the corner of bitter and sweet"" much better on the same subject."
4,Fun historical book,"The book 'The Young Carthaginian' is about Malchus, a young Carthaginian man who gets involved in the war between Carthage and Rome.I liked reading this book because it realy helped me get a deeper understanding of the Punic Wars, Hannibal's crossing of the Alps and the different characteristics of the two cities that were at war with each other.The story was a bit perdictible in parts. Every time Malchus got into trouble with his enemies you knew he would get out with hardly a scratch. Also, Henty has a tendency to go back and forth between explaining what was happening with all of Hannibal's army and talking about the protaganist. I personally found this made 'The Young Carthaginian'a bit cumbersome to read, but other than that I enjoyed it."
3,"Nice Sound, But.....","This thumb piano (aka ""kalimba"") has a nice sound but, like all such instruments, needed tuning before we could play it. Unfortunately, the two screws that hold the key bar down were turned so tightly by the manufacturer that the slots on the screw heads began to strip before I could get them loosened. Only by dint of careful (but forceful) work could I finally get them to move. I had to replace both screws with new ones after I finally got them out. The screws on the tuning bar need to be firm, but not torqued down so tightly that they present this problem. The instrument works fine now, but we were about ready to return it at one point due to this issue."
4,cerebral comedy,"Miss Firecracker was obviously a play before a movie. The plotlines are deep, as are the emotions of the characters. I do not care for Tim Robbins, but I will make an exception here. Wonderful movie!"
1,poor and defective,The yersey has damage and i still have a problems because I returned it and he didnt return my money back I returned one month ago
3,Good but the color was off,"The quality of the jersey was great and sturdy. The color pallet of the blue was off. Looked faded. It was not dramatic but as I got my son a youth jersey that arrived the same day, the color difference was obvious. I kept it becuase I like Manning, love the giants and It could pass for too many washes faded it a bit. And the price was better than what I could ask for."
4,good speakers,these are solid speakers. I use them as surround speakers so I cannot say whether or not they have great sound but they certainly do the trick for surround speakers. They look nice and were very easy to install on my wall.
5,Great Speakers,Bought these for my surround sound system. Great sound and the white speakers blend in much better with my living room than black speakers. Very pleased - exactly as advertised.
3,What a cute pair of shoes....the first week!,these shoes are soooo cute but because of the leather they have so many scuffs they look grayleason learned
5,"SIMPLY STUNNING, AMAZING !!!","The ""GENIUS"" Harris Quartet in this particular album turn into a masterpiece. Pure Art! What else to say about it ????"
3,Better,Nice focus on Keiko and Worf who were new to the series but it was more of an episode filler than a full blown book. It had a good balance between characters that were associated from the past and the way in which they had grown and were embarking on a new relationship in a new place. The hard balance of these series books is that they can't change anything so they have to be static to a time and everyone may be challenged but can't have anything of massive signifigance happen to them. This is both an artistic limitation and inherent ST series in books flaw that unfortunately is only solved when the shows are no longer on. One reality must be sacrificed for the other.
2,Not too good.,This movie had it's ups and downs. I'll give some of each. Here's some of the good. 1. Some laughs 2. Some scares 3. Good effects 4. Good death scenes (particularely the scene where the dude got his face scalded by hot steam. Bad 1. REALLY bad acting! 2. Weird plot 3.Bad diologue. Well you get it. D+
3,He's back!,"Leprechaun (Warwick Davis) is back & is searching for a bride in this less clever sequel. So, he travels to America and goes on a killing spree again. Leprechaun & his movie start losing their charisma while it reaches the middle... & the ending is a big let down."
3,An Ok Sequel,"Warwick Davis returns again to play the part of that homicidal 3 foot tall leprechaun, only this time he is looking for love after being robbed of his bride a thousands years earlier, so he comes back looking for the ancestor of the woman that was taken away from him. Although not scary this movie has a lot of humor and gore, making it worth the renting price. Rated R for strong violence and gore, strong language, and brief nudity"
5,Best Coffee Pot I ever Owned,"I've had it for five years and never had a problem. I'm amazed it has worked this long but I do clean and maintain it on a regular basis. All the features still work perfectly. Coffee still tastes great as long as I clean it every two months or so. I can't believe all the bad reviews but maybe I have just had amazing luck or perhaps people are more prone to do reviews when they have a bad experience. Anyway I highly recommend it, one of the best small appliances I ever owned and I've been around awhile."
2,Fancy look but doesn't make good coffee,"Product looks nice and sleek with the stainless steel top and glow in the dark clock, but doesn't make great coffee. The temperature is never hot enough even when it is set to ""HOT"". It also started leaking from the back every time I use it. (which is not that often) I would rather pay for a cup of coffee in the neighborhood than use this machine!"
5,Scott has never sounded better,"Scott Hamilton's tone and phrasing on tenor go beyond ""classic"": the man is simply archetypal. On this album he is captured with greater clarity and lushness than ever before. Every nuance of his breathtaking artistry is brought shining to the surface for your ears to enjoy. Alan Broadbent's string arrangements complement Scott's rich tone perfectly, while at the same time they avoid cliche or syrupy triteness with some unusual and innovative voicings. This is the strings album for people who don't like strings albums."
2,not worth it,"I am not happy with this product. It is very weak in purifying my car and it annoyingly has to be turned on by pushing the power button everytime u start driving, which i tend to forget to press. It would have been so much smarter if they just made it turn on automatically when u plug it in the lighter socket."
5,Love this writer........,"Mauve Binchy writes in a way that takes you to the location and keeps you truly involved... all of her characters are believable and keep you wanting more........... I have read all of her books and can not wait for her next,"
4,Awesome,It was such a pleasant surprise. Just watch it. You will not regret it. love it. Such unexpected twists and turns ....
5,I did not even see it coming,"It is rare that I get blindsided by a show. Most are pretty predictable, but this one was really good! The acting is enjoyable, the characters do their parts well. My wife even liked it, and she hates watching subtitles."
1,So bad,I threw this item in the bin..I was 17 I remember this clearly.It was the 2nd time I had had bad dreams after reading the suspense.Fair enough-I had a Flu both times-But Even besides all that My gosh..what is wrong with Kate William??!I mean its like she would sit at a typewriter and think How can I bore people to death today??Only fabulous characters like Elizabeth and the dazzling Jessica(and no one else mind you)kept me wanting these books.
4,Not bad tries to....,"Incorporate real life problems, with each chapter having a question that many have seen in real life. I have used this book parts 1, 2, and 3 in the softcover and found it to be a fairly easy read for a technical book. The book has step by step examples, informative appendices and colorful graphics. A job well done by the authors."
2,a poor book...,"This book really did not cover any topic thoroughly enough for the reader to get a thorough understanding of the topic. I found that the authors did not use vector notation at all,(they were introduced once and then never used again) apparently deciding that vectors were too advanced a concept for introductory students. The only thing I have to say is that my general high school physics course was more advanced than this. This book truly does not convey the fun that physics can be."
1,The physics of confusion and random ideas,"This book is being used in physics classes at my university. Supposedly it is based on ""concept physics"", but it is not. If anything, it is based on ""arrogant weedout physics"" and totally fails to teach the basic ""concepts"". Instead, nearly all of the problems in the book include a good deal of ""magic thinking"" and teach confusion. I went back to Ohanian."
2,Great Acting but a bad story line.,"Mario Van Peebles, Patsy Kensit, and Paula Marshall are all talented individuals whose talent went to waste in this film. The storyline of crime busting werewolves was really dumb. The main werewolf itself looked like a joke in comparison to the werewolf in ""An American Werewolf in London""."
3,shape-shifting interest welcome!,"If you love Dracula and The Werewolf of London, then you'll definitely enjoy this film. It houses all the elements of horror. Humans changing into half-breeds and similar to other lust-ridden scripts, has made this and other monster-mammal movies popular. I was satisfied with the ""dark"" atmosphere; which complemented quite well with the tense primal action."
3,It's Byron Lee but not his best...,"Any Byron Lee release is going to be good, and if you are new to soca, this is a great CD to buy. It contains the biggest songs of the year as well as a remake of Tiny Winey and an oldies medley. If you are like me however and have all the originals, it is not essential. The biggest thing that was missing was a great new song like ""Jump Up"", ""Brassline"", and ""Soca Tatie"" from the past few years. Good, but last year's was better..."
1,Rust pot,after a few weeks all it does it create orange rusty water. Very unsitely and probably not very healthy. We have stopped using it
5,yup. it's a kettle!,"Simply put, it works fine! Rusts up pretty quickly inside but outside is fine. I seasoned it inside and out and re oil the outside occasionally. Basically that's a character trait of cast iron, ""it rusts"" If you don't know cast iron you might want to stay away but I love it.."
4,this is a must book for strategic managers,I am a fan of This writer. i read few books of him on management control and management. This book is very useful for managers. it might change views of traditional mangers view to a modern view. i expected more details on value chain analysis in strategic cost management perspective though.
4,I hated neurology until I read this book,Amazing the easiness in reading how our brain works!! Many study cases which help to understand brain circuits. I am a psychology student and I used to hate anything related to biology and fisiology but this book is making me love neurosiences.
4,"To the letter, fine entertainment","This story was well thought out and very fun to read, at least for the linguistics fan. The letter format was ironic as the story dealt with letters (and loosing them...) and it was an easy way to become quickly intimate with the characters.This novel can be taken at face value, as a sweet fairy tale with a happy ending, but it is also an important comment on censure and government power over citizens' rights.Very quick and entertaining, a wonderful weekend read!!!"
2,Play on Words,"Both the title and the conclusion are very clever. However, that is about all there is to this book. The author is able to play with words. I commend him for being able to find words that do not use the banned letters. With very shallow characters and a banal plot, even the word play becomes tedious about half way through the book. Perhaps Reader's Digest could condense it by two-thirds and use it in their sample give aways. I plan to donate my copy to the local library."
4,lot's of fun,"This is a clever little book. Some may find the dependence on written letters annoying, but I found myself quickly turning the pages to determine how it all worked out. It is a quick read, you can finish it in a day if you wish. Reading the last 50 pages or so were particularly enjoyable. This is supposedly a commentary on censorship and totalitarianism but don't expect anything too deep. It builds on a cute gag and is a fun book"
4,"LMNOP...the few, the proud, the still standing","It's a cute tale about the fictional island of Nollop, which was named for Nevin Nollop who supposedly penned the pangram*: the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. As letters fall off the cenotaph below Nollop's statue, the high council decrees them abolished, too. Slip-ups bring punishment and eventually banishment from the island. Few Nollopians remain to stand up to these stringent measures and censures, but one who does is Ella Minnow Pea. She is integral to finding another shorter pangram before time runs out. The story is told through letters to friends and family that get progressively more interesting to read. This will definitely will give the reader pause when thinking about the complexities of language as well as how icons and laws can be twisted.* pangram--a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet at least once"
5,Rosie RULES!!!,"I've probably listened to this CD about 500 times at least. (Ok- I admit I'm obsessed with her wonderful voice and interpretations!) It's this CD that turned me on to Rosie. I now have about a dozen of her CDs. In her autobiography, she talks about her deep love for her good friend, Nelson Riddle, and it shows in every song she sings on this collection. I think his arrangements are just terrific.I prefer her mature voice. It is filled with richness and emotion and I'm convinced she has lived every single song she sings. In a crowd of luscious voices from her era, Rosie stands out as my all-time favorite. May her legacy live on forever."
2,"THE IDEA FOR THIS PROJECT WAS GREAT, BUT NO CIGAR.",I HAVE BEEN A ROSEMARY CLOONEY FAN FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS BUT I MUST SAY THAT I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS CD. ROSEY CHOOSE TOO MANY SONGS THAT WERE NONPOPULAR SONGS. .ON THE POPULAR SONGS SELECTED SOME OF THE ARRANGEMENTS WORKED AND SOME DID NOT WORK. I RESPECT THE WORK OF NELSON RIDDLE BUT THERE IS SO MUCH HE CAN DO WITH HIS ARRANGEMENTS. OF THE 16 SOINGS LISTED I ONLY LIKED 5.
5,Awesome!,"I am a long term Ultravox / Midge Ure fan. I search everywhere to find his material. This is a great CD! Just as wonderful as ""Answers To Nothing"". For those out there who like Peter Gabriel, Annie Lennox, Tears for Fears and Depeche Mode, you will love this CD. It's not pop music but it's not boring. It's for us 80's / 90's people who have grown up and love music with a meaning. You will really love this one!"
4,"If you like Enya, Dead Can Dance, etc., consider this disk.","A solid, listenable ""best of"" album. Some of the alternative versions of their best songs work pretty well, with a notable exception in track two. Chandeen is often featured in the ""Heavenly Voices"" compellations with good reason. Good band."
4,"Very fine performances, but not worth the high price.","This box set was in my local library, so I finally got a chance to hear it. If you want to add the op. 44 quartets to your personal library, I would not recommend this expensive cd set. Compared to other recordings, these performances are understated and a little distant, although technically they are impeccable. I wish that the first movement of the 44-1 quartet was a bit faster. However the last movement of 44-1 is extremely fast. The first movement of 44-2 is beautiful and silky smooth, and the great scherzo of 44-2 is slick and brisk. The last movement of 44-3 is so fast that it sounds more like a scherzo--a testament to the Emerson's apparently limitless technical skills. It's a little weird to hear a recording of the octet that was accomplished with digital trickery, but the performance is fast and clean with extremely good intonation."
2,What happend???,"Romeo was great! his music was cool and energetic, and you had fun just listening to it, and now????? well all the songs sound the same, he sounds like bow wow too, arent they like soppose to be rivals?? How can you pick one if they sound the same. I dont know but he is a great rapper, but this just didnt have the same feel i liked about his last two albums."
3,"Ehh, its juzt ok...","My boi has a grown up voice on this album, & it SUCKS!!!! He sounds just like his rival BOW WOW!!!! Wut, u 2 r supposed 2 be rivalz, not try to sound like each other!!!! Well, that duznt explain y this wasnt as good as Self Titled & Game Time, halv of the songs just sound rushed & bland, like a typical dirty souther. Theres even sum songz that sound like his doomb father Master P!!!!! Well, sum of teh songs wer good, dah expecctikon beeng My Cinderella. Well, check out Game Time & Self Titled before this! Peace!"
1,Review by a 14 years old grand daughter who likes mathematics,"I would say that the book is alright, not excellent, if it were a simple novel with a plot-driven theme.But if you want to learn math, then sure, read it. It explains math concepts fairly well, and isn't really hard to understand at all.Little secret- i never did finish it, school came along and it just isn't interesting enough (at least to me) that you actually want to know what happens...it's something that I read when I had nothign better to do.Honestly, I didn't like it too much, just because it wasn't captivating enough for me."
5,Polly wants some Maths?,"Excellent, fun tale enriching you with great history & quotes related to Mathematicians. You'll love it!"
2,CLOSE TO EXPIRATION DATE,THE PRODUCTS YOU SHIPPED WERE ONLY A FEW WEEKS AWAY FROM EXPIRING-I RETURNED THEM TO YOU
5,"Great follow up to ""The 7 Deadly Sins of Small Group Ministry""","As a new youth pastor here in the Inland Empire area of Southern California, resourcing with our local churches has proven to be most beneficial regarding the adaptation of small groups to the ministry.I was directed by a small groups pastor in the area to read this book as a follow up to the ""The 7 Deadly Sins of Small Group Ministry."" Having read the prior book, it really helped to clarify what tools/ideals will work within your ministry based on the idea of a church of small groups.Great theological insights on community and doing life together.Encouraging ideas on establishing a lead director, coaches and small group leaders while looking for someone to fill in the ""open chair.""Greatest point - small group ministry is built on PRAYER! There is no secret to success of church growth other than hard-honest work and PRAYER!Blessings"
1,Reaching New Lows in True Crime Books,"This book is all about Melanie Thernstrom, and not much about Bibi Lee.It's incredibly verbose, disjointed, and boring. You could cut it down to a quarter of the size and probably not lose any essential facts. But it would still be incredibly boring.While I sympathize with Melanie's loss of her friend, I find it amazing that she spent so much time on her own feelings, responses, actions, etc. during this time, and very little (and that little so chopped and flashback that your opinion of Bibi was not at all admiring) on her friend.Actually, by the first 60 pages, I had concluded that Bibi was rude and a spoiled brat, and Melanie was a neurotic cry baby. After that, I flipped through just to see if the boyfriend was guilty, and what the verdict was at the trial.I notice it's listed as something like $.21 used. Don't waste your money."
5,"Wistful, mellow, Celtic-inspired music for piano","Piano isn't the first instrument one thinks of in relation to Celtic music, but Paul Machlis' velvety playing lends itself beautifully to these wistful, mellow, lilting tunes. Joining him are Barry Phillips on cello and percussion, Shelley Phillips on oboe, English horn and high whistle, Eric Rigler on Uilleann pipes and low whistle, Debby Benton Grosjean on fiddle, and William Coulter on guitar. There are no lively jigs or frantic fiddling on this album; this is music that tugs on your heartstrings, music to relax and reminisce and maybe shed a tear to. If you like this sweetly sad Celtic fare, you may enjoy that of pianist Bill Douglass, harpist Calverly and the group Orion too. And check out also ""Celtic and Contemporary Music"" by Orison, and ""The Crooked Road"" by William Coulter, both of which feature more gentle, Celtic music by many of the same artists who perform here on ""Greenwoods."""
5,Great!!,"This disc really kicks!! I could hear any 4 of these tracks on the radio. My favorite would have to be M80. Rock needs a band like Sicboy to break out. They're original, different, and one of the better rock bands I've heard in some time. Definetely get this CD now!!"
4,This book worked for our family.,"This book worked for our family and has been an asset in guiding us to rear our three precious children. There are so many great christian books out there to help guide parents in raising their sweet blessings because there are so many different issues with each child. I hope you find the ""right"" book for your family."
1,Don't Buy It!!!,"I was recommended the book and regret I ever bought it, and especially regret ever reading it. The person that recommended it to me spoke so highly of the book that I bought several copies off amazon before reading it, thinking I would give it away to friends since it was so good. What a waste of money! The author sounds convincing, but even Satan can quote scripture. Please don't buy it, don't buy the book or the ideas in it, they are greatly in error. If the ideas in this book were to be followed they could lead to child abuse!"
1,Advocates the use of a rod on young infants,"The use of a rod on a baby, let alone any child, is not sound parenting, nor is it truly advocated by God. I wonder, in following the Old Testament, if the author advocates stoning someone for gathering sticks on the Sabbath, or declaring your children unclean if they eat pork? The use of the Bible to defend physical punishment on a child is deplorable, and any Christian should remember that Christ put an end to much that was practiced under the law of Moses. Consider instead books by Dr Sears, Dr Greene, or Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish."
1,Abuse 101,"If you want to know how to abuse your child and make them fear and ultimately despise you, this is the book for you. In addition it will help you raise a child who acts out violently toward others."
1,BLATANT CHILD ABUSE (NO stars!!!!!),"Appalling, deplorable, despicable, degrading, demoralizing, and downright EVIL are the foremost adjectives that come to mind regarding this drivel!I IMPLORE Amazon to take a stand and REMOVE this""How to terrorize, torment, humiliate, persecute, and oppress your infant/child (into ""obedience"") by way of violence guide"".I do believe there is a violation with your ""Terms of Service"" with regard to this product. Please REMOVE it!"
3,for a VERY small dog,"I liked the product but the small size was definately for dogs under 10 pounds. My 12 pound terrier was too 'squished' in this bed, so we had to return it for the next larger size."
4,Good book for any Rock fan (or fanatic),"I'm not really a Stones fan, but this book is an interesting examination of what we choose to make important in our lives, how we view our own obsessions (and behaviors) relative to those around us, and if/how we finally decide to back off from them. The uneasiness Mr. Baumeister's review attributes to the book is exactly what sets it apart - it makes us ask how much is too much, and whether we are sure our protagonist is on the right side of the line.I really liked the central role Chuch (the guitar tech) took on in the narrative, and found his story quite a jarring dose of reality, casting into sharp relief the circus he was surrounded by.Had to deduct a star for lack of props to the bass player - give Darryl some love!"
1,Derivative,"First he sings with the intonation of Dylan and then steals a few songs from the Randy Newman songbook and finally ends up with some over-orchestrated Disney cartoon-soundtrack wannabes. At least (for the most part) he got rid of the irritating drum machine that ruined his otherwise finely crafted pop songs of the late '80s like ""Mandolin Rain"".So far I find him to be a talented piano player still looking for something approaching his own style."
4,Just what we needed!,I order just 2 of these cushions to see if we'd like them and now I'm ordering 4 more. Thayt're great. They feel better than they look as if they would. I'm very pleased.
3,No drawstring,"The shorts are nice but I really wish they had a drawstring in them, I'm not able to wear them playing softball since they fall off of me. They fit well every where else but the waist.."
5,Comfortable!,I LOVE these shorts! They are the most comfortable shorts I own. They're great running shorts as well.
5,Years of use,I am still using this bluetooth headset. I like that it can clip to my glasses and not have to go over the ear.
4,9 Hours off talk time is unheard of.,I bought one for me then one for my wife. I have to say that it looks a bit big in certain pictures but its the perfect size. It doesn't hang off your face and as I said in the heading 9 hours of talk time is unheard of.3-6 hours seem to be the average for all the rest. That 9 hours of talk time is really helpful in a pinch when you can't get back to the charger.Overall this a great headset.
3,Just like any other treat,"From what I can tell the only reason that these treats have the Greenies name is because they are made by the same company. They slightly resemble the shape the the Greenies for dogs, but lack the same chewy texture. They seem just like any other dry dog / cat treat. One of my cats likes them, and the other doesn't. Neither of them like any one flavor more than the others."
5,GREAT!,"Disposable was 5 stars....& this one is twice as good as Disposable. Having several decks in both books, it's cool seeing them in print. The quality of the cover & the pages insure that this one will be around for awhile.I can't get why the forum doesn't get more steam. It seems like it has the potential to be better than S&B;."
2,Interesting but sloppy scholarship,"Kirsch's retellings of these bible stories are interesting, although they sometimes flatly contradict the actual text of the Bible. It is always fun to read what people think of these stories, but Kirsch's scholarship is sloppy: (1) He surveys only liberal biblical schoalrship, referring to it as ""the consensus of biblical scholarship,"" and ignoring a whole string of other views (2) He makes anachrnoistic mistakes (3) He apparently was not much familiar with the bible to begin with if he did not know these stories existed. When he does approach them, he does so with a skewed view, and without a history of studying the bible in its entirety for its own sake. (4) Intent on revealing some supposedly supressed tale beneath the text, he ignores the plain meaning of the text. If you are not familiar with the Bible, please read it in its entirety first, and don't swallow everything you read here."
2,A tabloidesque retelling of important Bible stories,"Anyone who is really familiar with the Bible knows these stories and their relevance to the more general situations. I was hopeful that more scholarship would have been employed in trying to explain the deeper meanings or lessons of these stories, or that they would have been put into context within the culture of the time. However, what I got was a ""National Enquirer"" approach to these episodes -- a little bit of fact -- no more than what's actually printed in the Bible, and where you think it's vague, put in some swaying breasts (not really printed anywhere in the Bible) to spice it up."
5,You bet I'm talkin to you!,"This is a fantastic DVD...it sets a standard for how other DVDs should be made. There are plenty of extras on the special edition release, including an hour long documentary about the making of the film, complete with interviews with Robert De Niro, Martin Scorcese, Harvey Keitel, Cybill Shepard, and Jody Foster (to name just a few). The picture and sound quality are excellent. A must have DVD!"
2,This movie was a disaster.,"I just saw Taxi Driver, and I must say that this movie is seriously flawed. Don't get me wrong, it has some great one-liners. The acting is superb, and the underlying concept is sound. The biggest problem is that the story is complete trash. It's like the writers couldn't decide on a coherent plot so they threw together some unrealted events and try to pass it off as a story. What did the assasination attempts have to do with anything? The entire premise of this movie can be described in one or two sentences. The racism in this movie is blatant and obscene. Don't waste your time with this one. For anyone looking for a well done psycological thriller I recommend Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo."
5,ONE OF THE BEST FILMS EVER MADE (DON'T LISTEN TO LEONARD MAL,"THIS FILM IS SO REALISTIC. IT COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE,ESPECIALLY ME. THE GREAT THING ABOUT TRAVIS BICKLE IS THAT HE' S AN ORDINARY GUY THAT WE CAN SYMPATHIZE WITH. ANYBODY WHO CALLS THIS FILM TRASH OR DOESN'T LIKE IT IS CLEARLY AN IDIOT. THIS IS FILMMAKING AT IT'S MOST REALISTIC AND BRUTAL. A MUST SEE. DE NIRO GIVES A POWERHOUSE PERFORMANCE."
5,study in a nightmare,"""Taxi Driver,"" viewed in the wake of the shooting of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, unfolds like the keys you need to understand how something so horrible as an assassination happens. It is a profile in isolation, desperation, crisis of self-worth and the corrosive effects of an unhealthy society. You can see the trials of the misfit as he attempts to fit in with others and the deepening despair and feelings of insignificance that follow the failures. You can follow the logic trail to violence as expression of last resort. The arc of the storyline is so perfectly realized that the end feels almost tacked on, a throwaway comment on the attraction of manly, heroic violence that rings false, unless I'm misreading it. Either way, this is a storied and deservedly decorated piece of filmmaking, with brilliant turns by Robert DiNiro and Jodie Foster, and a great American director at or near the height of his powers."
2,What's the big deal?,I had heard so much about this film that actually seeing it was an anticlimax. One of the best films ever? I don't think so. I prefer De Niro's later work and found that parts of the film really dragged.
3,Taxi Driver,"My thoughts on Seeing Taxi Driver,the film itself is complicated to explain,yes there is Intense Violence and you have someone who is not well,on the other hand You sort of have De Niro's Character and the Loneliness come through Raw and Gritty,I would call it a Gritty Street Film Not ART or A ""Masterpiece"",It certainly was not meant to Be Pleasant. Certainly Cannot Condone such behavior,I was skeptical because I thought maybe it was a Political Statement at the time on Guns and Violence as usual from a Hollywood Liberal Perspective,and it might be in a way in some sort of hidden meaning. It also just so happens De Niro is a Vietnam Vet in the movie or former marine so the Stigma and ""Political Jab"" may or may not be there for some including myself. I do not view it as a Classic but It is Eerie,And De Niro certainly pulled it off."
4,BUY THIS MOVIE,"This movie was an excellent film with Robert De Niro in it. For all of you DeNiro fans this is his best movie he has EVER BEEN IN. BUY THIS DVD AND WATCH IT ALONE. Go to the store, buy some Goobers, then put this DVD into ur DVD player and watch it 6 times in a row, or watch it until you have memorized the script, and you can be cool like me, and be like ""You talkin to me"" and then tell all your freinds about how you stayed home alone on a friday night and watched a Robert De'Niro movie and then were shocked by the cool ending. Anyways this is a great movie and any movie fan should buy it. It falls into the drama/art house category by my terms, and is definitly a shocker that is worth every penny."
2,Not quite what I was expecting.,"After reading and hearing so many good things about this film I was sure it would be a great movie, especially because DeNiros in it. Unfortunatly I ended up being very wrong.The whole movie seemed like it was just a bunch of random junk to make it longer. The so called climax also left much do be desired. Bodies fell in some very cheap slow motion effect, and the whole scene seemed to end very quickly. It left me saying ""I watched all of that for this?"" Please take my advice and don't by this movie."
1,Was there a point to this?,"Overrated piece of !@#$. Absolutely NOTHING happens in this movie other than being forced to listen to the same incredibly cheesy music over and over and over again. After an hour and a half of wondering if anything is ever going to happen, DeNiro shoots a couple people. The end. Wow. What was all the hype about? Genius? Artsy? I don't see it. Don't waste your time. Is this movie highly rated for any other reason than being one of DeNiro's earlier films?I rented this movie because I saw it on a program ""The 100 most thrilling movies of all time"". What a joke. I'm sorry I wasted the $3.50 to rent the DVD.If this is movie is considered to be a ""classic"", then certainly it's true that nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public. Okay, let the ""not helpful"" reviews flow.."
5,Maynard still ROCKS!,"This has become one of the most prized CD's in my collection. One quick correction of a previous reviewer : Larry Foyen does not play lead on this CD, Scott Englebright does. And man, does he have the chops! This whole album is nicely woven and tightly played, with plenty of stratospheric trumpet for the true Maynard enthusiast. Scotty is one of the very best lead players MF has ever had, even going back to the Stan Mark days. Sorry Matt Wallace, but I could do without ""She was too good to me"" and the bad vocals, but the rest of this compilation is A ++. And at 70 + years old, all I can say is.. You GO, Maynard!"
5,Maynard Fergusion: Big Bop Power House!,"Wow is all I can say about this great album. This album is truly one of the best jazz albums I have ever listned to. If you like up-tempo jazz that makes you want to get up and boogie, this album is a must buy. Maynard Fergusion is an incredible musican who can play the heck out of his trumpet. If you get this album, you will not be disappointed!"
1,Absolute total garbage!,"There's an old saying that goes ""There's nothing like the real thing, baby."" This product IS the textbook example of that quote. Extremely unrealistic (if you've ever actually had sex before) and not to mention, very difficult to use for a ""simple sex toy"".Bottom line is folks, if you want the ""real deal"", you go out and get the ""real deal"". Whatever your pleasure may be or whatever gender you puruse, you're not going to get any form of realistic experience from any of these products. I mean ""any"" of them with all of the orifices."
3,Lovely but Short,"This music was lovely to listen to, but it was a very short cd compared to what I usually find on cds, classical or otherwise. I also felt there were very few ocean sounds for a composition that highlighted them in the title. Nice, but worth listening to ahead of time if possible to see if it's really what you're looking for."
2,DISAPPOINTED,Was very very disappointed it would not play on my 2 DVD player's only on my Computer and I did not buy it for that. Wish I got my money back for it.
4,Great Coverage but too advanced?,"This book helped us learn where to start with solids, what to offer, how to make homemade, and how to progress to finger foods. Our only complaint is that at times the suggestions for finger foods were too advanced for our child's eating habits. After consulting other sources, I saw that my child's progress was great and that this book's suggestions were just that."
5,Very good music,"I have had this CD for about two years now and was browsing to see what other people had said about the album and Pete Escevados music in general.I enjoy listening to latin jazz, especially where a good bassline is included (see Jimmy Haslip on Red Heat for example) and for me Flying South is a great album. The energy that comes through each performance, even the slow ones, is exceptional.The CD captures a variety of moods. On the first track, Sheila Es drumming and the support her fellow musicians give her as she develops her solo is incredible! I have yet to hear a more intense piece of music!! The salsa-like bass on track 10 is fantastic, swaying all the way to the end. In fact there is not one track that is a let down. So much energy and none of the limpness/repetitiveness that one tends to experience with smmoth-jazz.I recommend the CD without reservation. Enjoy!"
4,Wonderful Big Band Jazz,"If you like big band jazz, and especially Basie jazz, this is the recording for you. Frankie Capp and Nat Pierce put together a great group of West Coast studio and other musicians who performed in the band when they could find work. It was a labor of love. This is a live recording form 8/76 made at a Los Angelas jazz nightclub.What a group! Trumpeters Blue Mitchell, Bobby Shew, Bill Berry; Sax section:Plas Johnson, Richie Kamuca, Marshal Royal; Ernie Andrews, vocals. This is just the highlights!They swing through classics such as ""Moten Swing"", ""Dickie's Dream"" and ""Roll em Pete"", just to name a few.Good big band records do not grow on trees. Get this one."
2,Not great,"Not as good as we had expected, especially at the price. One cut was great. May try listening again in a different mood to see if that makes a difference."
4,A funny but awakening view on an elder's life,"Society seems to have a pre-conceived notion that the elders should simply fade away, after they have served their 'term' through those youthful & agile years. However, just like everyone else, their satisfaction & happiness rely on their sense of completeness (to be depended upon & needed once again) & yes, to be loved. This book takes a look at what the elders (have to)do to cover those long barren hours in their twilight years..often drowning in senile depression should they fail to find something worthy of their time & attention. However, it was presented in a funny way --- what with Mrs. Washington playing an over-aged 'Cupid' to two elder lovey-dovies, & later on becoming a victim of 'granny romance' in the end. Mr. Horowitz' rich blend of characters is just as lovable as well."
2,Two months use equals zero results!,"I have typical male pattern hair thinning and alopecia areata. I'm always looking at different products to stimulate growth. I have been using this for nearly two months and have not noticed any volume benefits or signs of hair growth. While I continue to try JM products, I consistently am underwhelmed. This one is like wetting my hair down with fancy water! Take a pass on this one."
3,Old But Good,"My son wanted a Sonic the Hedgehog DVD for Christmas & even asked Santa Claus for it when he seen him! I found this one & thought I'd go ahead & buy it since I couldn't find them in store. It's a really, really old story & it is only one episode with a bunch of commercial type interruptions in it, but my son doesn't seem to mind too much. I wish I would have know this though, maybe I would have shopped around more for something a little more up to date & longer. But, that being said, it is worth the price & everything shipped fast & in good condition."
1,Not his best,Oh my this book was so boring and slow compared with his other novels which I own and love. I kept expecting for a shift to peak my interest but it just never came along. Get this one from the library don't bother buying it you will be so sorry.
2,Review of book,"weak plot, Not up to previous Alexander McCall Books that I have read. This whole series of Isabel Dalhousie novels are poor."
3,An Edinburgh Mystery,"Isabel Dalhousie is a quiet, refined lady philosopher. One night at a concert a young man falls to his death,apparently accidentaly, but Isabel suspects otherwise and sets out to find out the truth. She is helped some of the time by her niece, who has a hunky new boyfriend. Isabel does not understand the appeal of hunks, which tells you all you need to know about Isabel. She likes her niece's former boyfriend, who also helps her in in her investigations.This is a quite pleasant but unmemorable mystery story with a rather lame ending. Isabel is not nearly as interesting a character as Mma Ramotswe, and the story generally lacks the charm and humour of the Botswana-set No. 1 Ladies series. Rather disappointing."
1,The Smugly Pretentious Clubbed,"Well, one can but wish...Having read & loathed this some years previously, I found myself bored, snowed into a cave in the Antarctic with nothing else to read, and, of course, suffering from a philiosophical guilt that perhaps I had not been appropriately appreciative of the literary and intellectual offerings of this book.Wrong.So I built a mini-Edinburgh out of ice and snow & then had a lovely time jumping on it & smashing the whole thing up."
1,Tedious,"I have enjoyed the McCall Smith #1 detective novels, but this book was a huge disappointment. It began slowly, as did his other books, but never picked up the pace or got any better. The characters were dull and the storyline iffy at best. The ending was anti-climatic and ridiculous. No satisfaction whatsoever. Don't waste your time."
3,So-So,I didn't like this as well as the No 1 ladies Detective series. The book started slowly. The ending had a good twist.
3,A Good Read,"I'm not disappointed with The Sunday Philosophy Club, but it is difficult not to compare it to The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, a series I adore. Isabel is her own character, more internally focused than Precious. The story had more telling of events instead of experiencing the events first hand through Isabel. I like Isabel, but I'm hoping to like her more in the second installment which I also own."
3,It's not Botswana,"Like so many of the other reviewers, I was disappointed that Isabel Dalhousie's adventure didn't have the quiet charm of those of Precious Ramotswe. Isabel has her flaws as well as her strengths, and she moves quietly through the mystery with a great deal of reflection, perhaps too much for a story of this genre. I personally admire a book that depends on reasoning and thought rather than slam-bang action. Being a fan of Jack Aubrey's adventures, I also don't demand that all the ends get tied up neatly by the close of the book.But I have a feeling that, as this series continues, Isabel may become like Angela Landsbury in ""Murder She Wrote"", whose fellow citizens become victims, one by one. Precious at least doesn't have to cope with a murder in every book."
1,A real disappointment,"What a letdown! I kept reading this book hoping it would get better, but it never did. There is a real lack of charm in both characters and place, and a real overburdening of the reader with uninteresting philosophical musings. The Mma Ramotswe series is so much better."
3,How I entertained myself reading it...,"The most fun I had reading this book was adding to sentences, like: ""You're brave and good (and intensely boring) and you don't even know it.""I would have enjoyed it a lot more if, after reading a moralistic article about Every Single Human's obligation to be thin due to world hunger, Isabel had gone out for a jumbo hot fudge sundae.The Scottish setting was very interesting, another strong female character so promising, but the book was a big disappointment. Isabel is hopelessly in love with her loser ex-husband, completely unaware of her pretensions, and painfully aware of her desire not to be pretentious. Humorless, tediously introspective, and boring."
4,Funny Fifties fur flick,"This campy B-grade teen-exploitation horror flick stars Michael Landon as a tortured teen whose overly-aggressive behavior can either be explained by lycanthropy (yeah!!) or hypnotism performed under the guise of psychotherapy (bo-o-r-ring!!) The manipulation of a troubled youth by an unscrupulous adult authority figure is fairly subversive, although the ""scientific"" explanation doesn't quite explain all that hair popping out of Landon's scalp. A classic midnight movie."
2,"Oh man, who thought this up?","You read right folks, Michael Landon ala Little House on the Prairie and Highway to Heaven stars in this B-grade turkey. He's supposed to be a werewolf, but looks more like one of the Berenstein's Bears. The chicks in this flick are kinda cute in a 50's sort of way, you know the innocense and all. And being naughty was sharing a soda. The mad doctor who Michael seeks help from is the real nut of this movie. This is good to watch along with 'Teenage Frankenstein' for those rainy days as your watching your girlfriend's kids."
5,I WAS A TEENAGE WEREWOLF,"I HOPE THIS MOVIE WITH MICHEAL LANDON BACK IN THE 50;S I WAS A TEENAGE WEREWOLFCOMES OUT ON DVD SOON IT,S A WONDERFUL MOVIE I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT ON DVD. I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO OWN IT AS WELL."
2,Waited years for this,"Kinda good, kinda boring, but not nearly as impressive or entertaining as the previous ""Tonight and the Rest of My Life"". Get Tonight instead."
4,It only works if you put forth the effort...,"This book was assigned to me while I was going through counselling. I think it is a great tool for understanding why we have all these negative thoughts about ourselves. There are journalling exercises as well as mental ones posted at the end of each chapter. I especially benefitted on the chapter about identifying the ""critic"" inside your head and ridding yourself of him/her."
1,Worst Book on Oil Ever!!!,"I'm in the oil industry and have read many books on the subject. All this book does is summarizes ""The Prize"" which is the best book about the oil industry ever published. It provides nothing new or even any original insite on the subject.This book is not an anatomy of an industry it is nothing more than this authors attempt to push his political beliefs on the reader and blame George W. Bush and his presidency for all the issues that exist in the world. Ironic part is that 99% of what he blames the Bush administration for existed long before he ever took office.If I want to hear about how bad George Bush is I'll simply watch CNN and save my money but not buying a book like this.FYI - I am not a republican and did not vote for George Bush."
2,This Lady Has a Little Drill Under her Arm!!!,"I remember seeing this film as a child, curiosity had me revisit it last night. Some films stand the test of time, even if filmed in the 1970's, they can still be viewed enjoyably today. An example would be The Exorcist or One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. This film, Rabid, just screams 1970's and does not stand the test of time. The music, clothes, hair, even the film used just does not date well...therefore making it a cringe worthy viewing today.The movie is more gross than scary. Marilyn Chambers develops some kind of drill in her armpit that sucks people's blood...the victims then exhibit rabie like symptoms..it isn't really explained what is going on, or why she gets this mutant thing under her arm...I'm not going to destroy this film in my review, I am just saying it doesn't date well.."
3,Ok movie,"I looked for it for a while, and finally found it, and bought it, and watched it, then put it on my shelf and never viewed it again and that was like 1 year ago or so. Its a decent movie there could have been more excitemnt more rabid people and more blood thye movie is actually quit boring not scary just regular. Its the type of movie you watch and wait and nothing really great happens at all. Rent it first."
1,No cure for this film!,"I consider myself a big horror fan, what with a video collection of about 110+, but this is a bad egg, of which I regret owning. I hate this film to be perfectly blunt! The only Cronenberg movie thats half decent is THE FLY. I found this film far too slow, and character development was totally scarce. The FX are naff and it all seems like an excuse for ex-porn star Marilyn Chambers to get her kit off every few minutes. Whats with the virus/mutant thing coming from out the armpit, wouldn't it have been more creative to have it coming out of other, more visible parts, like the mouth or something? This could have been a good film, but to me it's one of the... movies ever made. Avoid!!!"
5,rabid,cool early vampire /zombie movie i rember the trailer scaring the crap out of me when i was a kid
5,Help your young child learn all about John F. Kennedy,"This book explains to a young child who John F. Kennedy was, where he came from, what he did in his life, and how his life was ended. It is written in very simple prose and has lots of photographs. My mother bought this for me shortly after JFK's death. After 9/11 there were many references to the JFK assasination. I recently tried to explain who JFK was to my young son. I retrieved this book from my parents and enjoyed reading it to him as much as he enjoyed hearing the story. It is a sweet, simple, and touching account of history."
5,"I hate doctors, man!","A refreshing variant of the rash of late 90s teen semi-comedies (American Pie, She's All That, Never Been Kissed, etc etc), SLC Punk provides a unique perspective of the formative years. It's well written, well directed, well acted, and well shot. Highlights include the (almost) nonstop humor and an acid trip scene potent enough to give you flashbacks. In between this is a strong storyline that provides food for thought on being true to your ideals. SLC Punk is well worth your time and your cash."
3,We're all posers...,"eh...It was an okay movie. I might buy it if I had some extra cash laying around. It had a good message over all, but it also had the whole cliche ""punk"" thing going on. To me the movie was basically showing the ""punks"" who think they're the voice of what and who is punk that..we're all posers. None of us are non conformists, we all conform in some way. I also liked how he finally realizes that anarchy will never work. Because it wont...so all you ""anarchists"" out there..need to think a little more before you think that anarchy would help the world any."
5,ths movie really explains the scene,"I've never seen this movie before but I really wanted to see it so I just bought it straight on DVD and I really liked it. This movie gave a good explanation on the punk scene and what punk truly is. I dont agree that all punks have to grow up sooner or later though. This movie also had great songs from punk bands from the 80's like The Adolescents, The Exploited, The Ramones, etc. So if you grew up in the 80's listening to Punk then I suggest you rent this movie to take a flash back."
4,Great!,"This is a hilarious movie with a great performance by Matthew Lillard. I seriously recommend this title, the satire and portrayal of punks is first rate - a great watch."
3,Interesting characters trapped in cliched circumstances,"Punk--at least as it is portrayed in the media--became cliche a long time ago, so the scenes that are intended to show us the punk movement in general terms, such as the party and concert scenes, seemed somewhat passe. This film's strengths lie in its specifics--the characters and the performances--rather than its portrayal of the milieu they inhabit. Matthew Lillard is great as Stevo, an achiever who can't find a constructive way to channel his energies, filled with anger about the hypocrisy of the mainstream world he must one day join. Michael Goorjian is also very good as Heroin Bob, a gentle non-conformist who is terrified of illicit substances.Although I was never a punk myself, it seems to me that this isn't really a punk movie since it depicts the scene as a way station on the road to either dying or putting on a suit. For a film with a more subversive attitude, check out ""Repo Man.'"
2,SLC Punk--Not Worth Owning,"I saw this movie in the theater and really had nothing bad to say about it. It was well-rounded, entertaining film, so naturally when I began building my DVD library I considered this movie. I still contend that it's a good movie, but not one that you'll want to watch more than once every six months. It just gets boring after a while. Rent it, it's good, but don't waste your time or money buying it. All it will be is a blemish on the face of your DVD library."
3,"Original Plot, Good Moral, Bad Presentation","""SLC Punk!"" is one of the better Indie films I have watched, the ""plot"" keeps you hooked, the moral at the end is good, and the characters (for the most part) are believable. Certain charcters add only a small gimmick value to the film, such as Sean, the acid dealing punk, who is in an unfortunate acid accident. There are several humouristic lines, in particular the scene where the protagonist, Stevo, is rambling on about England. This film is worth taking a chance on, but is not the best Indie film there is. Parents be advised, sever drug usage and language are contained."
5,Highest Rating from AN ACTUAL SLC PUNK!!!!,"I was an SLC Punk in 1985, so I knew the scene inside and out. Like Stevo, I moved on to other things (I'm a professor of history now). This film captured the scene perfectly, and I could've sworn a few characters were patterend after people I knew. This is a terrific film, and Matthew Lillard's wonderful performance is not to be missed."
2,No story,"I rented this film thinking it would be great. I love Matthew Lillard and it sounded interesting. About an hour into the movie I realized that so far, it had no story, no plot, no anything. I didn't know where the movie was going. All I truly knew was that this group of punks hated rednecks. I don't suggest this film unless you like storyless movies."
1,What is This Crap?,"Was there even a plot in this movie?This movie was incredibly annoying, with Stevo (Matt Lillard's character) ranting to the camera every 5 minutes about what he thinks of this and that. Was this the teenage angst everybody was raving about?This movie isn't about punk rock. It's just another movie trying to cash up on the popularity of the punk subculture.After about an hour into this, I was annoyed by this whole thing, I had to turn it off. Good waste of 3 bucks.If you wanna see a good punk film go rent Suburbia."
5,Great Book For Musicians,"This is a very useful and practical book especially for musicians like myself who want to know how their music is legally protected. Its written in an easy to understand style with lots of interesting examples. If you want to learn about copyright, this book is well worth it."
1,Item not as described,"Although this book came quickly, it is in far worse shape than indicated. The front cover is covered in creases from being bent and folded, and the text is filled with messy circles, haphazard underlines, and notes in INK."
3,Trashy fun.,"Not great literature, not insightful writing, but trashy, adolescent, smutty fun. If you're not expecting more, you should enjoy it."
1,Terrible,"This was the first and ONLY Heinlein book I've ever read.It's a sleazy 70's porn flick with lasers. About as deep as a mud puddle and every attempt to inject sex into any situation comes to pass; gang rape, torture fantasy, homo-erotica, wife swapping, etc.This was not a work of good literature in any shape of the imagination and the main character's primary function seems to be to serve as the sexual outlet for others."
5,Scotch Brite Toilet Scrubbers,"Great sanitary way to clean your toilets. When you are able to change out the scrubber head as often as you like, it makes it so much easier to clean. They are a great quality product that is a superior clean!"
3,WEST COAST DOO-WOP,"WEST COAST DOO-WOP RECORDINGS ON THE DEL-FI LABEL,WHICH WAS KNOWN PRIMARILY FOR SURF AND HOT ROD RECORDINGS, AS WELL AS BEING THE LABEL ON WHICH RICHIE VALENS RECORDED. SURPRISINGLY, SOME OF THIS STUFF IS PRETTY GOOD, THE BEST CUT IS ""THAT'S WHY I CRY"" BY THE CASTALEERS, WHICH WAS AN EAST COAST GROUP."
2,From Broadway to Bebop,"There is only one song that I wanted, the others are not to my liking. She was an excellent singer."
2,bally slimmer,"Wore the belt when I would go walk and it felt comfortable and felt that it was indeed working. After 2 weeks, I noticed that it is coming apart at one of the seam areas. I handwashed it mildly. I think bally needs to improve workmanship on this product because it was not cheap."
4,Good but a little loose,This product is loose on me even though I wear it on the last zipper. I do sweat a lot more while working out.
1,NO way,this crap doesnt work!!! save your damnn money..The zipper broke after 2 uses...cheap and useless
5,very comfortable,I like this slimmer belt. It helps ease my back pain while power walking or jogging. It's very easy to put on too!
1,Waste of money,"You may get very excited that you can close the belt at the last zipper. You may be excited that it does not feel too tight when you do so. You will, however, be very disappointed when you take it off and see that the neoprene foam has ripped away from every seam, and the foam has also torn in various other areas- after the first use no less. If you really want something that lasts, look for another product."
3,Poorly Made,Received my item on time from the seller. The stitching came apart the first time wearing it. But can't complain for such an inexpensive product.
1,it broke on the first day...,"When I first opened the package, I thought it was a little flimsy. I thought the zippers would be nice so I could tighten as I progress. When I tried it on, it was so large, that I had to put it on the smallest adjustment possible.Now, I'm not a small guy. I'm 6'1"" 220 lbs. with a little belly.The next day, I put it on and wore it to work. It felt great. I could feel the heat from the belt around my belly. After a couple hours, though, it started feeling loose again. I took it off and saw that it had split at the seams.As I said previously, the material was really flimsy. The neoprene is SO thin, there's really no support."
3,The material is very rubbery,"I have not use the belt, so I don't know how it would fit. My purpose to get this belt is mainly for the material. Since I didn't like the rubbery material, I didn't use it to make the support belt for my mom."
4,It Really Works,"This belt really is a great buy. It definitely makes you sweat, focuses on your mid section and and back fat. It's great for walking/running the track or your treadmill. I am 31 inches in the waist. I did have to remove and replace one zipper to make it snugger. If you don't have a sewing machine, the dry cleaner will move your zippers for a custom fit. Enjoy"
1,too large,"I bought this thinking the zippers would make it fit well. I have a 33"" waist and it is too large for me. I wouldn't recomment it at all!"
3,"Loved it at first, then it proved unreliable","I really loved this belt, but after 2 weeks of use, it tore within the lining. I believe it was a factory defect only. So, please if you purchase this product check it thoroughly to make sure there aren't any slices on the inner portion of the band. It didn't tear at the seam, which I would have contributed to over usage, it was a slice."
1,Beware,"Product is extremely hard to zip, though once on does give good back support. No way I would exercise in this though and this product runs really small. I gave it to a girl friend and she is very small and it took two of us to zip it. She tried to use it the next moring and again had same zipper issues that I had. Love the concept but for us it just didn't work out. Sorry."
1,not worth it,if you want to use this to sweat dont waste your time on this product. its hard to get on and just doesnt work
1,Not worth the money.,This product is not worth your money and for educational purpose just get a fish or a tadpole.
1,Wrong collection - Coordinates instead of Impressions,"The item named Impressions should be a lightweight milk-coloured mug, which is break-resistable. Instead, I've received a heavy stoneware Coordinates mug, which breaks easily. Really disappointed."
3,Good but not as good as his other books,"Although this book was interesting, it was nowhere near the caliber of some of his other publications. ""The God Particle"" by Leon M. Lederman was incredible; I couldn't put it DOWN. This one, although informative, sometimes I couldn't pick it UP."
3,"Teacher in a book ,rm. 101","For someone with no professional disciplines in this field. I found the book to be a great teacher in physics/theoretical physics fields. Tough in some areas, atleast for me. But, gave me insights on how it all comes together atleast theoretically. I enjoyed it. If this subject entertains you like me, you'll like this read... Better yet read ""Quark and the Jaguar adventures into The simple and the complex"". By Murray Gell Mann. I found that book fascinating in its own right."
2,Listen To this before you Buy,"First I read the it got a meddal and it had great reviews, so I tried it. I am a lover of Fantasy books but I must say this was the worst by far. The plot was so bad and uncaptivating but I hoped it would get better, it did not. I do not get why people called it a great book and why it got a meddal. I would never recomand this book to anyone, but see for yourself. Who knows you may like it..."
5,a great McKillip book,"This was the first McKillip book that I read and I've now been reading her for over 10 years. This book is full of interesting beasts and is a great introduction to McKillip's writing. I recommend that you read this book if you like fantasy or other McKillip books. If you don't, give it a try. :-) Enjoy!"
4,Lyrically beautiful,"Not truly a ""coming of age"" story, but it has a similar type of theme. A woman who becomes more than she was. McKillip writes with a near-lyric quality. Truly an enjoyable book."
3,beware: you may have to do rewiring for 4 lines,"This is a nice phone -- the previous review is accurate. The phone has some nice features but be aware that the four lines are not 4 ""seperate"". Instead, your modular cords have to be wired so that one cord carries two lines. You can't just plug four seperate phone lines into the phone. I ended up returning the phone because I didn't wanna go through the phone wiring hassle.I suspect adapters are available to combine two lines into one but that search seems like it could be a morass of frustration."
3,Steinbeck the Great,"In my humble opinion, John Steinbeck was one of the greatest writers who ever lived. However, The Forgotten Village: Life in a Mexican Village is merely a simple little story. It is not bad reading, and was apparently made into a movie, though I've never seen it."
5,I love this fragrance!!!!,"I, too, have been wearing this perfume for at least 15 years. I get compliments all the time from women as well as men; it must work with my body chemistry. My daughter says she loves when she picks up her daughter from visiting with me because she can ""smell"" my scent on her child. The store that I used to buy it from, is no longer carrying it, so I am thrilled to find it here. Similar to another response I read, I thought it was MY signature scent."
2,"Self-published, no content","I'm beginning to see how reviews get stacked by authors/publishers who are selling their own material on Amazon, and this is one of them. A smattering of dated stock file photos and a few words...I'm not sure what it's purpose is. I'd have spent all of 10 seconds with this one in the bookstore."
2,I Can't Make it Work,"*sob*, I've tried every grind on my grinder, I've packed it, I've packed it less, I've not packed it, I've put it in both positions in My Hamilton Beach and the water still runs out of the machine. Anything that makes it into the cup looks like weak tea and I won't discuss the taste. No, don't ask me, I won't. I could have been knee deep in actual coffee pods for the amount of coffee I've wasted. I'm so disappointed."
5,"Great, once you learn how to grind your coffee...","The first few times I used these pods I got really weak coffee. The key to getting a good cup is grinding your coffee much finer than you would for a ""normal"" drip coffee machine. Once I figured that out it made great coffee and was much cheaper than buying pre-made pods."
1,Weak in the knees...,"The concept is great, but there is something about the filter that doesn't allow water to pass THROUGH it so much as AROUND it. I found that the water had to take a moment to penetrate the filter and then soak the coffee grounds before it actually even began taking on color. There was at least an ounce and a half of clear hot water in my cup before colored liquid began coming out of the machine. I have tried it several times in several different configurations to try and make it work and it simply is no match to the regular pods. Sorry... I was really looking forward to this product. Bummer."
3,Very messy!,"It seems like a great idea, but it turned out to be a big mess. I only use the Ecopods when I run out of the Senseo Medium Roast pods. I only use them for backup."
3,Ecopad Filter,"This is a good filter that can be used instead of high-priced pre-packaged pods. However, it does have a few ""cons"".1. Don't expect to make your cup of coffee in a hurry. The Ecopad has to be filled, then grounds have to be disposed of, and the filter rinsed.2. Don't overfill the filter--the Ecopad lid will come off if filled too full when the grounds expand. It seems as if it snaps on, but it pops off easily, making a mess in the holder.3. Disposing of the grounds can be quite messy."
4,Good substitute for the pods,"Good substitute for the pods, but the pods are still better. Can't do double pods with these like you can with the real pods. Single servings only."
4,perfect,Now I can finally use my Senseo coffee maker! It is so hard to find a store that sells pods still and now I can use my favorite brands and/or flavors of coffee with my Senseo!
2,makes awful coffee,"I had to return this item after a week. Supermarket cffee pods don't make the best coffee to begin with...but these reusable ones are even worse! Using high quality coffee beans still resulted in very, very weak coffee.If you want to save money...get a new coffee machine, not these Ecopads! It's not hard to clean/operate a regular drip machine...and you will get much, much better coffee."
2,Bought wrong product.,"Looks like it will work but got the wrong product. Sold it new in used area, now somebody else is happy!"
1,Ecopad,"I purchased the Ecopad with the idea of using it with my Hamilton Beach one cup coffee maker that takes the Senso pods. BAD IDEA. It does not work. All it does is make a mess and leave you wanting the coffee you thought you would get. It is easier to take a regular coffee filter and make your own coffee pod than to attempt to use these. It may be there isn't enough water pressure in a machine like the Hamilton Beach that there is in the Senso Machine, but I was very disappointed."
2,"ECOPAD for SENSEO DELUXE - save your money, don't buy it","Unfortunately, it doesn't work. The coffee cup is VERY WEAK no matter how tight or loosely you pack it. You may as well spend the money on the actual Senseo pods. It was very disappointing."
4,Worth the Effort,"I felt bad that I used to buy disposable pods to make my coffee, so I found these reusable ones. Don't get me wrong, these pods eliminate the need for disposables, but make the whole process longer (if you want coffee instantly, you'd be out of luck and maybe a little frustrated). First, you have to fill them by hand... which is pretty easy once you get the hang of it. Second, you can only brew a single cup at a time -- which could take you twice the time if you normally brew a double cup.That being said, they make a nice cup of coffee and I love that I now have an infinite selection of java to choose from. Plus, the benefit of not having to use a disposable pod is worth it to me. I will definitely continue using them."
2,Quick-Cup versus Eco-Pad...Winner is Eco-Pad!,"I have explored a number of different ways to use my own grind of coffee in the Senseo Coffeemaker. Folding filter paper didn't work....too much water goes by the filter making a week cup of coffee....The Quick-Cup sounded like a good idea....but it doesn't fit the holder tightly enough and too much water goes around the filter to get a good cup of coffee. I found that the Eco-Pad fits tightly into the two cup holder and it works well. The key to any of these re-usable pods is that water cannot be allowed to go around the filter. The pressurized hot water must be forced through the coffee.The Quick-Cup and the Eco-Pad are essentially the same design but the Eco-Pad fits the holder correctly and the Quick-Cup is slightly small. Buy the Eco-Pad, it works. The Quick-Cup would work if you could rig a small rubber band seal between the Quick-Cup and the holder...a gasket, to prevent the water from going around. Good Luck!"
1,Disappointed;(,"I was really excited when I saw this product on Amazon and had to have it right away because I love the idea of using my favorite coffee (Kona) in my machine.When I got my EcoPods, I packed them just as the directions indicated, using an espresso grind. It was difficult keeping the little cups closed because they just snap together, but I finally got it.After popping it in the machine and turning it on, I noticed that liquid that came out was just water. It was just up at the end that any liquid that resembled coffee started coming out.I tried this several times, using different methods--priming the pods in hot water before puting them in, packing the pods even tighter, packing the pods with less coffee... Nothing!Most of the time, the water just seemed to flow through the pods without absorbing the coffee.I usually don't give negative reviews, however, advice to those thinking about EcoPods: don't bother."
3,For Hamilton beach coffee maker filters may be a better choice,This was bought for the Hamilton Beach coffee maker which is not pressurized like the Senseo. It works OK but it is easier just to use a small coffee filter and fold it over.
3,A little disappointed.,"The eco-pad makes a relatively weak cup of coffee. Maybe the coffee I am using is not ground fine enough. I would prefer a two cupper, more like a mug of coffee."
1,Not convenient,"Too much trouble Not what I envisioned Waste of money Quicker to cut regular filter down to size and put in coffee. Makes a good cup of coffee without the wash,dry,fill of this item"
1,Disappointed. Should have listened to reviews.,"I bought these because it's hard to find the pods in the store and also, because they can be pricey. I read the positives and negatives and decide to purchage anyways. I found that the pods dont work. Water goes around them instead of through them, which is disappointing. We made sure there were no grounds around the edges and everything fits tightly together, however, after many attempts, we were still not successful. I may return this product or contact the sender."
4,"No problem, works on first try!","Opened the package, took the top off one, filled it with my wife's favorite can coffee, put the top back on, put in the two cup pod holder and voila...she had a good cup of coffee with even the froth on it. Dumped the grounds, rinsed off the holder and done...total time from open package to finished clean up...minute and a half. Couldn't have worked better"
3,Does not work with Juan Valdez (JV) machine,"These, unfortunately, do not work in the old Juan Valdez (JV) single server pod machine (as seen at Target years ago). They are simply too wide.It would be nice to get exact dimensions within the product description."
1,"Did not work, Almost broke Senseo","I tried the product, following the instructions to the T. The coffee pod has a thing on the bottem that fits right into the slot on the bottom of the senseo filter holder. This little piece blocked the hole were the coffee is supposed to filter through to into the cup. Needless to say we got coffee everywhere. Additionally, the filter jammed the lid on the Senseo and required almost Senseo dismantling before I could open it back up."
2,Eco Pods,"I read the others reviews and took a chance on these. I would not give up the original pods - I like the taste and the ease is unbeatable, but these are okay and I will try another type of coffee to see if that makes a difference. These things are a pain to clean and I usually manage to get coffee all over the counter as I'm trying to fill it. But, if cost is an issue, these are more economical by far. Others wrote they just used paper filters folded over. I can't imagine how it fit in the holder without making a mess as if it isn't just so in there, water does leak. I call my Senseo my ""Jetson"" coffee maker as it is so high tec! Love it!"
4,"Great product, less waste!",We recently purchased a Senseo coffee machine and included in the box was a bag of their coffee pods. We love the creamy top layer of coffee but did not like the fact that they were one time use pods. A friend told us about the EcoPads and we were sold! We purchased 2 sets (so 4 total pads) and love them. they are top rack dishwasher safe and have held up very well. I was leery that they would not provide the creamy layer atop the coffee but they did just as good as the disposable pods included with the Senseo. These are a wonderful product! Many thanks!
3,Works OK,"it seems to work but like the senseo in general a lot depends on positioning the pod just right, etc. Also requires that you pack the coffee into the pod tightly, otherwise it's easy to just get a cup of hot brown water. To some degree it defeats the ""easy"" aspect of the senseo, for the extra effort to get this right I might consider brewing a real cup in the french press."
2,"Weak, Weak coffee",I bought the eco pods but I have been disappointed because the coffee just seems too weak for my liking. I have tried it about 3 times. I was worried I might pack it too tight or put too much coffee in it so that might be the problem. I will keep trying but so far I am disappointed.
1,NOT for Hamilton Beach Single cup Brewer,"I bought this product about a week ago and it absolutely DOES NOT work in my Hamilton Beach brewer. If that is the coffee pot you have (model 49970) then do not buy these. Its not just a weak cup of coffee, its basically water. I tried regular ground first and then espresso ground and neither worked. They are also a pain to fill up because they are so small and get coffee everywhere. Don't get me wrong, they SEEM like they will work because they fit so perfectly into the compartment. But they don't. I loved my coffee machine when I first got it because the Senseo pods were so great but now that they aren't available anymore and these stupid things don't work either its basically a worthless piece of junk sitting on my counter."
4,Good pod substitute,"The pre-made Senseo pods remain the quickest, tidiest, tastiest way to a Senseo cuppa coffee. However, I love my Eco Pads for using up or trying loose coffee. I've even tossed my Eco Pads in the dishwasher without harm. These are my favorite second choice."
1,Totally disappointing book,"The contents of this book is NOT what the title saysand if I want to guess the target readers the authors had in mind, it is for a reader who never saw Windows before and just joined a computer science course, it teaches what is a variable,loops, arrays, and OOP, only until page 664 you will read window programming and that is almost 2/3 of the book and what you get at that point windows can run more than one program at the same time and you'll see a big picture (figure 20-4) windows running three applications as a proof!!!You will NEVER see .NET in this book other than in the book title.NOTHING complete in this ""complete reference"" no complete projects nor even how to compile them which is very essential for a beginner this defies classifying it for a beginner,I my self won't recommend it for a beginner, there are far better books that teaches C++ and windows programming."
4,Upstairs/Downstairs in the New Deal,"Janeway presents a very personal account of the role of his father Elliot and all of the New Deal and post-New Deal personalities who dominated American poltitical life from 1938-68 and entered his household. He saw up close how power was used for both the benefit of the country and for personal advancement; the good, the bad and a little bit of the ugly. Such New Dealers as Tommy ""the Cork"", Bill Douglas and Lyndon Johnson come to life."
2,Not up to par,"I found this particular Costes album a bummer. Flat, dull, droning grooves. No sparkle. I agree with other reviewers on this score. Skip this one."
2,Title and Content do not match,"The title of this book and the information suggest that it's a daily devotional book about spiritual life. Actually, it's more like a Native American history primer, which is fine, but not what I wanted at all."
5,365 days of walking the red road,i love this book. i lost a copy that looked like a porcupine due to all the notes marked in it. this copy will look like that soon. great quotes and very interesting information about the origianl native americans.
5,Simply Stated: A Great Book!,"Dru successfully outlines the creation, development and deployment of 'disruptive' marketing strategies used on some of today's most successful brands including Apple and Absolute. In addition, he helps you get an understanding of why disruptive thinking is important, and in many cases, essential for the everyday entrepreneur. The visuals in the book certainly help and the well-organized structure of the content makes for a good read. Advertising and marketing folks, you won't be let down."
1,Not good,"I got this CD for their hit song Dangerous on the Dancefloor, but the version on this CD is not the club classic. It's some lame remix version. Don't waste your money on this CD."
3,Pleasant and unremarkable...,"This is a very strangely produced CD, in that it has no liner notes or any information beyond the list of ten songs that are included. The CD itself is the only place where I could find an album title.In any case, it's a perfectly acceptable, if largely nondescript, album of Christmas music. The Boston Pops play good music, and they play it well. The selections included are some classic Christmas tunes, including Leroy Anderson's delightful ""Sleigh Ride."" Several of the selections include an unnamed choir.Overall, this CD is fine, and I enjoy listening to it. But it doesn't offer anything sufficiently unique or special to receive a higher recommendation from me than 3 stars."
1,"Great Music, get one of the other CDs","What a waste only putting 10 songs on a CD! There are more complete Fiedler Christmas CDs. I suggest Pops Christmas Party and A Christmas Festival (though there is some overlap of the two). Or even, Christmas at the Pop's Greatest Hits.Performance: 5Amount of content: 1"
2,My least favoruite live Celine album,"Of the 6 live Celine cds I own, this is by far and wide my least favoruite. On first listen I find something about them I like, not this time, and that is sad.1) The short version of 'It's All Coming Back To Me Now' is blasphemy.2) Far too much talking (for my taste) between songs, shut up and sing!3) Too short, the total cd time is Sixty one minutes EXACTLY.4) No live version of 'A New Day Has Come'Now for the good points (which were hard to find):1) Live versions of 'I'm Alive', 'At Last', and 'I Drove All Night'2) Her version of 'What A Wonderful World'3) The DVD is nice, but not enough to save this.While not all bad, not one of my favourite live cds. I'll stick with the import 'Live At Olympia' and 'Live In Paris' as well as the two other live cds I have, much better in my opinion. I realize that this is from Vegas and Vegas means big, but after listening to it I hope that when her stay is over she gets back to a real show."
2,just ok,Celine Dion at one time could release just about anything&now that has finally caught up to Her because Her Material her just sounds there.vocally She isn't particular Strong on this set. I've heard better from her.this one is kinda dry.
3,Celine hits Vegas,"I was really excited that Celine was releasing a live album. I still am excited about it. I was, however, hoping for some more signature Celine numbers. My biggest disappointment is that the title song A New Day Has Come isn't including.As others have mentioned, there's some talking on the album and that's wonderful. BUT... I think the talking should have been placed as the end of the tracks instead of at the start of them. That way you wouldn't have to listen to the same talking every time you wanted to hear a song.The bonus DVD is great, although it only runs 35 minutes, not 45 like the packaging says. Her ""never before seen"" live performance looks like she's lip synching My Heart Will Go On. The full video for One Heart, and the other videos from the album would have also been nice bonuses for the DVD.Overall I'm very happy with the release and am looking forward to the whole show on DVD this fall."
3,As good as the show,This CD is great to listen to and even better after seeing the performance in person. My only regret is that there seems to be a couple of songs missing from the CD that she sings during her show in Legas.
3,Great as always,"Celine's songs are always very good; however, still awaiting the DVD of the entire Las Vegas show; not the bits and pieces as was included with the CD."
3,Without the Production Designer...,"...the cinema photographer would have nothing to photograph. They copy the Production Designer's color sketches and make it real, but it starts with designs along the lines of great artists like Richard Sylbert, William Cameron Menzies, and David Hall. Without it, these great films wouldn't have stood the test of time. Interesting film, though."
1,Unprepared for the lack of freshness quality...,"I gave this item 1 star only as a necessary formality, though I would have left the stars blank if I could.Since I've always been more than satisfied with my Amazon purchases, I was disappointed in the less-than-fresh, (read: stale,) taste of these imported cookies. Granted, this was my first order of a food item, so I can only look to this product distributor for answers to why the quality was sub-par.I had planned to give these cookies as incidental Christmas gifts, but am scrapping that notion as well as the products."
3,"These are o.k., not anything special","These cards are pretty run of the mill. Several of them have some sparkle to them but most I would not have purchased individually, which means they will probably not get used or I will donate to Salvation Army. Which is fine. I felt, as I looked through them all, that a lot of them were targeted toward adolescents or young adults.... not exactly my personal target group when sending cards. The price was fair for what you get and they arrived in a timely manner. I would not purchase these again."
4,100 words almost everyone confuses & misuses,"I purchasd the above book, the Painless Vocabulary book, The Grammar Devotional Book, and Grammar Girl's Quick and Dirty Tips for Better Writing. These books are not only funny, but I have been able to write better papers for my college classes. Love them!"
5,Great Vocabulary Book for Older Elementary to Jr. High,"This is one of those books that helps you to avoid reinventing the wheel.You could delve into a good classic novel and find all kinds of vocabulary words for student to learn... or you could save yourself the time and buy this.Michael Greenberg has taken choice words from choice reading material and compiles it into twenty chapters with fifteen words per chapter.First, the student reads an essay that includes the fifteen words. Greenberg discusses how to find the meaning of a word by its context, he covers the ways in which a word can often be misused or misapplied.There are then exercises for the student to work through (answers are in the back) on meaning and using the words in context.Stick with this book and you will gain three hundred new words, use them and they will be yours for life."
5,Who is Lee Hays?,"I first hear Lee Hays on a CD entitled ""Best of The Babysitters"", a children's compilation that featured Hays and Alan Arkin front and center. It's easy to be drawn to Hays' deep voice. It has that unique sound, sometimes compared to that of Burl Ives (if we can compare), that leaves me wanting more of Lee. I would like to hear more of Lee Hays music... I'm sure there is some wonderful examples out there. His life and time were interesting and complex, but getting back to his music, he was one of a kind."
5,The most nostalgic music for me,"I searched for this album for at least 12.3 eternities. I have finally found the holy grail of Celtic music. I listened to this when I was a wee boy and brought me to a Celtic wonderland beyond imagining. I can't believe I finally found this CD, I can't wait to listen to it again. If you buy this CD, it will easily be the best purchase you have ever made."
1,"Excuses, excuses!","This book has an underlying negative view of relationships. It might be good for couples in very traditional relationships that are beginning to learn how to create something different. However, for the most part this book emphasizes gender differences and uses them as an excuse for why relationships are not fulfilling. The recommendations are either very simplistic...or manipulative. None seemed to be productive or long-lasting solutions. I bought ""The 5 Languages of Love"" by Gary Chapman at the same time as this book, and found it to be extremely helpful and productive. (My boyfriend even enjoyed it too!)"
1,Not the same as original copy,I ordered this product & after I received it I was not happy. This book is not the same as the original copy. It does not show pictures of the maps nor any other pictures that were in the orinal copy.
4,Cool UT book,"I got this book as a present from one of my UT buddies; needless to say, I have a bit of an advantage over him :-) The book is most useful when it shows you the secrets of all the levels; some are really devilish to find, but really cool. It doesn't cover any of the recently released levels, and I kind of wish that they had a corresponding webpage where they covered the new levels and the like. The rest of the information about the levels was a little bit confusing, but if you glance at the book while playing a level, you should be ok. The stategies they presented were very good, but most of them can be found on UT websites. Some of the information was a little bit off, but I didn't trip over it much. Overall, the book is well worth it."
1,Corrupted file on CD-ROM - Cannot get game to load properly,"I purchased this expansion pack so that I would be able to use the web add-ons that are provided by the game's maker, Blue Wolf. I have been unable to get the game to load due a file on the disk that I bought that is corrupt. This information was told to me by Blue Wolf when I wrote them regarding the problems that I was having with the game. They said the ccdata.ccx file is corrupt and the expansion pack is not able to be fully used. I am not happy with this situation and would hope Amazon will inform the seller that they are selling defective products."
1,BEWARE of JEF FILM releases of classic silent films....,because they look very poor.... BAD QUALITY dvds that are almost unwatchable.... certainly not worth the money :-(
2,Great Content - But Poorly Constructed Paperback,"I'd love to give this collection of early Spider-man comics a higher rating, but I'm very disappointed in the physical construction of this thick paperback. About the third time I opened it, the entire glossy cover and spine popped off...leaving me with a sheaf of newsprint held together with a thin film of latex. Unfortunately, I've had the book for more than 30 days...so I'm stuck with it.No complaints with the content or presentation...but don't expect the book to hold up for multiple readings."
2,Danger!,"I bought this slow cooker because of its large size and bonus insert, after having been very happy with my small Rival crockpots for years. Unfortunately, this new crockpot has disappointed me and ruined several large roasts because it gets way, way too hot. Even the ""Keep Warm"" feature keeps liquids at a boil. I have found that in order to successfully cook tender pot roast, I use the ""Low"" setting for an hour or two and then let it switch to ""Keep Warm"" for the remaining 3 hours of cooking. This is for a 6 pound roast with several pounds of potatoes, carrots, celery, and onion, stuffed quite full. I wouldn't even try cooking small amounts of food in this crockpot."
4,"Does a good job, ""low"" is still kind of high ..","We use this to make some treditional cooking that is left over night, the results were good however the low setting is still kind of high so you have to watch it for the level of liquid because if things get too dry it might burn.Overall its a good value or the price."
2,"cooks too hot, should not be called a slow cooker","Unfortunately, I like my old crockpot better than this one. What has rival done, even on warm my food boils. I think warm on my new crockpot is hotter than low on my old one."
1,Poor quality and poor customer service!,"After using this product for only a few months, the handle on the lid broke. The screw that holds the handle on, pulled through the threads. Clearly a defect. I called Rival customer service to get a new handle and was told I would have to order a new lid. Their waranty only covers the unit, not the lid. Very poor quality and very poor customer service. Stay away!"
3,Cool With You - JLH,This is a good CD but it does not have any new songs just old ones taken from her different CD.
4,More Than All Right,"Worth buying if it was just ""So Glad You're Mine"" 22 times. As it is, the other 21 cuts are the icing on this cake, including the remarkable ""I'm Gonna Dig Myself A Hole,"" the original version of the famous ""That's All Right, Mama,"" and the first popular recording of the standard ""Mean Old Frisco."" Although occasionally briefly profound, as in ""Cool Disposition,"" Crudup's music is mainly rockin' fun with a beat that will make you bounce and bop, as it did for the people who made these records juke box hits in their day. The tone of his groundbreaking electric guitar achieves what for many is the ideal blues sound, especially effective when accompanied by just drums. Although not considered essential in blues history terms, Arthur Crudup could easily become any blues fan's favorite singer."
1,Disgraceful,"To say that there are select people more ""vulnerable"" to sexual assault because of an astrological sign is disgusting and the author should be ashamed. No one person is more likely to be sexually assaulted in their lives based on what day of the month they are born. It is the fault of the criminals who committ the assault. To say the birthday of the victim affects it at all is placing blame on the victim which is what counselors and doctors around the world are trying to prevent. It is reprehensible and disgusting that the author writes and believes the victim is at fault because the mother gave birth to them on a certain day in a certain astrological sign. Shame on the author for perpetuating the societal myth that the victim is somehow to blame for the assault. I am insulted and offended by this book and urge the author to reconsider their views."
5,Flobee saved $2800 in haircuts!,"I've owned a Flobee (the same one!) since 1991. I can't say the new models are as robust as my '91 model, but the performance is similar. After a few cuts, you'll get the hang of it, and no one will know you cut your own hair. :: I calculated that over the last 20 years, I've saved something shy of $3000 on haircuts, using the Flobee. It's a keeper. (Be sure to oil the blades with light machine oil before and after the cut, and keep the cutting head unit in a plastic bag sealed with a rubber band.)"
3,Not versatle enough.,"I like the way it's built, as you can see it is a quality product. However, because of the spacers and they way you cut with it, it's simply not versatle enough. Therefore I'm returning it and getting another Robocut. It's much better for my hairstyle, but I have nothing else bad to say about the flowbee. If it'll work for your particular hairstyle, GET IT!Much better than paying some hairstylist to screw up your hair, as they always do."
5,An easy haircut..,"This is my second Flobee. My first finally got dull after about 4-5 years and many haircuts and trims for 2 people. It pays for itself after 6 or 7 haircuts. It works well and is easy to use, and requires a vacuum cleaner which is great because all hair goes into the vacuum. There is no hair mess, nothing on the floor or the person. If you like a salon haircut or if you have shoulder length hair, this is not your product. But for normal men's and kids' haircuts, or short women's hair trims, this product is great!"
3,A tasty snack for fans of Basie or Rushing,"These ten sides from 1947 (and one from 1949) plug a discographical gap between Basie's years with Columbia and the advent of the so-called 'New Testament' band in 1950. As such, they aren't really essential. But to the Basie fanatic, they offer considerable charms, including - once again intact - the justifiably legendary Basie-Freddie Green-Walter Page-Jo Jones rhythm section. Five of the cuts here are also vocal features for Little Jimmy Rushing, whose swinging and urbanely erudite version of the blues presages Ray Charles more than a little. But Rushing also had this clear, clarion voice, a sly wit, a gentlemanly manner, and an innate sense of swing that really made him one of the all-time great jazz singers. If you're new to Basie or Rushing, you may hear this CD and wonder what all the fuss was about. This isn't really the place to start. But this music certainly belongs in the collection of any true fan, particularly at this price."
5,Set your Youth Group on FIRE!,"Creative Bible Lessons in Romans: Faith on Fire! is an amazing book. I am a brand new youth leader (1 year of experience) in a brand new youth group. This book has not only set our kids on fire, but myself included! There are great game ideas, multi-media references, and it really ties into the real world learning that our students were looking for! Try this book! You will not be disappointed!"
2,Wretchedly bad flow rate,"As someone else observed, the flow rate is OK for the spray function, but it's ludicrously bad for the regular flow. I checked twice to make sure that the hot and cold water knobs had been opened all of the way.If I hadn't waited until I'd had it for more than 30 days to install it, I'd return it."
1,A Terrible Product!,"I purchased this product from a local big box hardware store. Upon opening the box I found that the finish on the sprayer head was wrinkled. I initially thought it must be some sort of protective plastic film but no, it was indeed the finish.This should have tipped me off to a complete lack of outgoing factory quality control but I took it back to the store and exchanged it. The second faucet ""looked"" O.K. and did install easily (the only positive!). However, when I hooked up the water supplies to test the faucet, it poured water from up inside the faucet head. You would think a company as well known as Kohler would do some sort of functional test before sending out their products!Twice burned, I again returned the faucet--for a Delta--which looks great and works perfectly!"
3,pullout faucet,Although the faucet is good looking there seems to be a problem with the sprayhead button. When it goes to sprayhead it is very difficult to return it to a regular flow. I probably could return it but that would mean calling a plumber back to remove it and then back again to replace it and that would be too costly so I guess I'm stuck with a faucet that doesn't operatre properly. I wouldn't expect a Kohler product to be defective.
1,leaky faucet after a week,Needless to say this cost us a lot of money. $100 for a plumber to install it. Another $100 for them to install a different one once we returned this one.
3,splashing effect,"We recently had this product installed as part of a kitchen remodel project. I love the look and the convenience, but I'm disappointed in the water flow. It produces a splashing effect and I end up with wet countertops and a wet shirt. We've tried to figure out if there is a problem with the aerator, but it looks OK."
2,not pleased with flow rate,"I have had this faucet about a month. The flow rate in shower mode is fine, but the regular flow has always seemed less compared to my past faucet. After two weeks of operation, the flow even got worse and has a pulsating effect. It looks nice, but am not that pleased with its operation."
2,Replacement Parts prohibitively expensive,"I purchased this unit from a big box retailer in Nov. of 2007 for $220 and, while the service has been acceptable it has become necessary to replace some leaky parts. At first I said to myself, ""Self, this is a clever design"" The hose and spray assembly was modular such that they could be replaced in a 'plug and play' fashion. I was stunned to find that the retail price to do so would have set me back $180.00!! Clever indeed!Research on the net has got the price down to $135. but that's still too high in my opinion. As an engineer, I am capable of rebuilding the unit and that's what I'll be doing (parts are about $40.00) but offer fair warning to those who are not as mechanically inclined. As such, I'll be purchasing something different next time."
2,Faucet hose deteriorates,"I really like the look, feel and finish of this faucet. However, I have had a problem with deterioration of the faucet hosing which leads to foaming and smell in the water when you first turn the water on. Based on the number of similar complaints on web blogs, this is not an uncommon problem with this faucet. To be fair, Kohler was quick to send me a replacement hose (the same type of hose as the original), but the problem recurred after just 2 months. This is a design or materials flaw that they have not yet fixed."
4,"Good compact scale, easy to use",I purchased this as an upgrade from my current non-digital type kitchen scale and so I could calculate carbohydates on foods. Easy to use and very compact.
3,amusing but too short,"amusing but too short, not really a mystery but an illusion of one. True Gorey in terms of drawings and content, but not a lot of book for the buck."
5,my favorite,This if my favorite perfume and its getting harder to find in the stores. I'm thankful that I found it on Amazon.com!!
4,Many stories; most good,"I am going to give each story in this book a simple 10 to 1 rating.

4,"Classic ""50's Sessions",Good to have these on one CD and good to be reminded ofthe high sound quality of Capitol recordings.
4,Just because its printed by the Microsoft press...,"Mr. Maguire is an experienced programmer, and this shows in his book. You'll find a lot of his advice useful. Sometimes though, one gets the impression that the author's showing off all that he's learnt.The book offers advice on how to write bug-free code (or as close to bug free as possible :). It is NOT for beginner, but if you've been programming for even a few months, you'll learn from it. Its not a 'dry' read either. While nothing should be taken as the final word in how to do things/code, condiser Mr. Maguir a teacher imparting his experience through the book. Finally, I disagree with the reviewers who feel that anything printed by the Microsoft press/written by Microsoft's engineers is no good."
4,"Good ""old school"" book","This book quickly reminded me that the ""old school"" rules to software development will always apply, no matter how many new labels you put on it (e.g. Agile). It was recommended to me by a college professor aside from the regular classroom reading we had to complete. And I was more than happy I purchased it and added it to my bookshelf."
1,Who are you kidding?,Is Microsoft really the one to write a book on how to write solid code? Is this some kind of perverse oxymoron?
2,Is this book a joke?,"Microsoft's Techniques for Developing Bug-Free C ? I did have once a lecture on developing bug-free code where the speaker used experience at microsoft as an example of bad practice, specifically I think they refered to the fact that microsoft word included about 10 or so different versions of the open file dialog all differing, so any bug discovered in one place would require fixing in upto 10 places.( I have not read the book, so maybe Mr Maguire was not involved with the OS or the Office suite development and with something else bug free.)"
4,Solid learner and intermediate level help,Writing Solid Code is not computer type centric - it covers both MacOS and Windows/DOS equally well. The code examples do not cover any OS specifics.The generality that is covered in the book is quite good. It helps you understand how to pro-actively destroy bugs that really should not happen in the first place.This book is first rate.
4,Good visuals and narration... interesting,"My 3 1/2 year old really loves this video. I have several littlemammoth videos (the publisher). They are well written, use children as narrators, and are very educational. The tape discusses the entire process of rebuilding a smaller home and modernizing it. It's begun with an architect drawing the plans, the demolition of the portions of the home that will no longer remain. Later aspects of framing, sheetrocking, following up by the architect and finish work. Damaged wood due to termites is discussed as well as an interesting visit to a university for a look at how termites follow smells. I have a deep respect for littlemammoth videos as they don't get ""silly"" and maintain children's attention throughout the movie. I refrained from a top rating primarily because of the ~5 minutes of advertisements in the beginning of the tape."
5,great slashing warrior game,great game! [...]we were so happy and then i beat the whole game on every single mode and it was hard for me to beat them with every charactor and i made 15 officers in officer mode and i beat it with all 15 of them too and the 30 level was pretty hard but i still beat all 90 stages.like i said i beat the whole game.it was fun i'm starting all over again.
1,No. Bad. Keep away.,"I have not heard this CD, nor do I want to. First of all, anyone who thinks they can sing Elvis songs well enough to be recxorded and released should be ashamed of themselves. Second, where are the hits? All Shook Up? Hound Dog? If you want Elvis, buy Elvis."
5,Bring Yer Wellies,"I purchased this CD as a gift. However, I have seen Gaelic Storm live and they were awesome, so I am sure the CD is excellent."
5,"Spatulas, knives, cooking spoons...","My grandmother sold these years ago with her Postal Workers' Wives group...I was on a stainless kick (still am) and bought this spatula, the turnover, two cooking spoons, knives, peeler, etc. Love them all! No rust, wash up easily, great with my stainless cookware of course, I even use them gently on a couple non-stick pans and pampered chef bakeware. This particular piece disappeared...we think with the birthday cake box...and so my husband told me to get it replaced...pronto! After 15 years, it is still the only cooking utensils we want...and it is something that I come here to Amazon and they still sell the exact same item...that says a lot!"
1,Leaks purple,"The purple in the dye leaks onto whatever you place it on. I did not want to try them in my hands, afraid I would end up with purple palms."
1,Pretty is ok for a purse but NOT ENOUGH for a $1000 Laptop,"This bag is prettier in person than online. It is truly lovely to look at. It does NOT have the padding to protect a laptop at all. If you set it down without great care your laptop will be jarred as there is very little to protect the bottom of the bag. And if left on it's side on the back seat of a car the light weight velcro closure would not stop your laptop from sipping out and onto the floor of the car in a fast stop. Lastly, the company is hard to reach and only replied to my emails after several attempts to reach them and after filing an Amazon claim."
5,The Crux of Christianity,"After viewing this film, I left with one, pervading thought: my deeds either add to Christ's suffering, or help relieve them. There is no middle ground for those who view this film.As the many reviews suggest, there is stark division between those who are deeply moved by the love Christ showed for mankind by enduring His Passion, and those who make a mockery of it: just like those who surrounded Jesus as He hung on the cross. Jesus prophecied that ""When I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto myself."" This is certainly true: ""all men,"" those who seek to comfort Christ in His profound, redemptive suffering; and those who choose only to intensify it.I am deeply grateful for the honest, Roman Catholic witness of this film to the Passion, Death and Resurrection of the God-Man. We all, wittingly or unwittingly, take our side as the result of witnessing Christ's crucifixion. And we are each manifested, inescapably, as either benefactor or malefactor as the result."
2,GIVE ME A BREAK,"After all of the thousands of words, arguments and heated passions that this movie has inspired since long before its release, it is a real downer to find out, upon viewing it, that it is a crummy movie. The subject matter -- the final suffering and crucifixion of Jesus Christ -- could not be more compelling, even for non-believers. But somehow Mel Gibson has managed to squeeze so much slow-motion blood out of the proceedings, without giving us any context for the character of the actual man, that the story is oddly passionless. And talk about over the top! The beatings, mutilations, and general bloodletting are so graphic that they teeter on snuff -- match this with the ridiculous horror-movie images of a slithery he-she as Satan, and you've got what could best be described as a gore-fest. Yuck. The two stars are for Jim C., who suffers nobly in a very realistic prosthetic nose, and the cinematography, which is at times lovely."
1,This Film Blowith,"I have to be honest with you, im not a religous person and that might be the reason that i dont like this film. Ive only been to church once (which was very boring i might add). The real problem with this film is that to me its just a guy getting whip and punched for 2 hours. And you know what that doesnt make for a good movie that makes for a movie that is really boring. The most fun i had watching this film was counting the times jesus got hit and cherring for the jews just so i could be on the winning side.Basiclly if your not a religous person i dont beleve that you will like this movie but if you are religous then you will love this movie (even though you have allready seen it). Me i want my money back from Mel Gibson."
1,Terrible cruel nonsence!,"This is very sadistic movie without any visible sense!Only blood and nothing more! No humanism of christianity, no Jesus's acts as the Messiah"
1,WORST MOVIE I EVER SAW!,"Please DO NOT waste your time, money, or energy on this worthless film. It is filled with lies, and far too much violence. We must teach peace and love. Jesus is surely ashamed of this film."
3,A Messianic Jewish view,"As a Messianic Jew, I saw both positive and negative aspects to this film. Jesus' resistance to the temptation to pick up the sword, and His decision to pick up His cross and endure all suffering until He fulfilled His Messianic mission on Golgotha was deeply moving and inspiring. However, this film reinforces the distortion that most Jews hated Jesus and wanted Him crucified. Thus our people were falsely labeled as ""Christ-killers."" In reality, Jesus was very popular with most of the Jewish people of His day. It was this popularity that caused the political and religious leaders to fear and envy Him. He was secretly arrested and tried, not to hide it from the Roman authorities -- who also feared Him -- but from His fellow Jews. Likewise today, most Jews regard Jesus highly, as a good and wise man, perhaps even a prophet. And a growing number of us even believe He is the promised Messiah of Israel."
2,Too Sick for the Eyes,"One previous reviewer of this movie got it right. This is more like an MTV, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" or a George A. Romero version of the crucifixion. Gibson tried to make a Biblical epic but instead he ended up with something that looks somewhat like a snuff film. Pretty soon, the long scenes of torture get so sick, you just can't stand watching anymore. Why is the Crucifixion suddenly turning into a 1970s horror movie with demons, baby devils, Satan, and gore. Sometimes the torture got sick, other times it just got silly.I can't even believe that church leaders let their congregants watch this movie. They even let kids watch it despite the fact that it was rated R. This film should be redone."
1,ITEM RECEIVED WAS NOT IN ENGLISH,"I ordered this movie and received it. It was not in English, actually it was in Aramaic. I returned this item and was told if I replaced it instead of getting a refund, they could not assure me that the new one would be in Engllish. The language was not shown anywhere in the description. They said they usually come in English but if they are out of it in English, they send whatever they have. THIS SEEMS LIKE A TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE PRACTICE TO ME! I asked for a refund and not only did they deduct the return shipping from my credit but they also deducted the shipping to me which I had already paid for.The Passion of the Christ (Full Screen Edition)"
5,All I can say is WOW!,"I just came back from seeing The Passion for the third time. Words cannot express my feelings on this outstanding movie by Mel Gibson. Not since The Titanic have I been so moved by a movie and other than The Titanic, this is the only [other] movie I have ever gone to see more than once.The Passion is also the only movie other than The Titanic that so moved people; people were crying. You really felt the passion of christ.Even if it is only a movie as some have said, it is a incredible movie. Definitely deserving of an OSCAR or 2 or 3 or more.Everybody I talked to loves The Passion and that includes religious folks, clergy people, ministers and even priests.The Passion is an absolutely incredible movie that you will want to see. But like a potato chip that you can't eat just one, I'll bet, that like me, you will not b e able to see this awesome movie just once.AWESOME WORK MEL! GREAT JOB!"
3,Sould have left well enough alone...,"I didn't see this film when it first came out in theaters,I just couldn't stomach myself to go see it cause of the quote un quote Hollywood concept now these are only my opinions there is only one film about Jesus that I loved as a child and years later still love its ""Jesus of the Nazareth""This film still brings tears to my eyes & my entire family every time that we view it,its just a way better movie..."
5,All The Glory TO Our LORD and SAVIOR,I highly recommend this movie. TO see what our King did for us sinners was just tear jerking for me the whole way through. Thank you JESUS!
4,A Very Good Upgrade for your DVD edition,The new blu-ray version of this movie is out and what can I say about it?The image looks great. Defenitly one of the best looking film in blu-ray. At least for me one of the problems is the fact the special features are place in a standard DVD which is a shame.
3,PASSION LACKS HUMANITY,"MEL GIBSON CONCENTRATED TOO MUCH ON TORTURE. TRUE, THE JEWISH DID TURN IN CHRIST BUT IS SPECULATIVE IF THE THEY TORTURED CHRIST IN THAT WAY. WHAT DISSAPOINTED ME ABOUT THE DEPICTION OF THIS MOVIE IS THE SAME PROBLEM WE HAVE WITH ALL OF THE MOVIES ABOUT JESUS CHRIST, THIS ZOMBIE LIKE APPROACH TO HIS LIFE. THIS SCRIPT CONCENTRATED ON A BLOODY TORURE FOR ALMOST TWO HOURS. NOT MUCH LOVE IS EMPHASIZED FOR HIM AND THE FOLLOWERS IS SHOWN HERE. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HIM AND THE DISCIPLES WAS FAIR APPROACH, BUT THERE WERE MANY FOLLOWERS WHO WERE DEVOTED TO HIM AS WELL. WE DON'T GET TO SEE THIS VERY MUCH IN THE MOVIE. IF YOU HAVE A WEAK STOMACH FOR TORTURE AND BLOOD, I DON'T SUGGEST YOU SEE THIS MOVIE. BUT THERE ARE MEMORABLE PERFORMANCES WORTH SEEING."
2,The violence is over the top,"I'm not squeamish, and I love gory horror flicks. But, those type of films have a different target audience than the Passion does. As others have pointed out, it's virtually a snuff film. The violence done to Jesus was not the sacrifice he made to redeem humanity; many, many people have undergone such savage treatment. What elevates his pain and suffering over anyone elses?I hope the irony of the masses of Christians subjecting their children to this film while at the same time deploring violence in videogames isn't lost on the public."
2,A sick gorefest,"Christ's true message of love and redemption is completely lost in this bloody, torture-filled horror show. Christians will be grossed out and disappointed, and those most in need of Jesus' offer of eternal redemption will miss it in this repulsive waste of film. Avoid at all costs. Rent ""The Ten Commandments"" or ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" instead."
2,Blu Ray Disk,"I got mine 2 weeks ago, buy haven' t had the time yet to watch, as I plan to watch it today (Good Friday). My only observation so far is that, the cover of the disk itself looks pirated. I'm not sure if it is really like that or what, but cover is not glossy at all. I will have to watch it tonight after my work and I will update my review with the quality of the movie. I just hope, it is really original as the cover really looks it is not genuine. I crossed my finger that it is just a cover, and the movie copy is great."
3,Good but did not live up to the hype.,"I am not a ""true believer"" and went to see the film out of curiosity. Technically speaking it was a well-filmed and acted movie. The fact that the dialog was in Aramaic and Latin gave the film historical atmosphere. Having been exposed to the story of Jesus Christ as a child I did not find the story hard to follow. However, I'd imagine someone not fully knowledgeable of the death of Jesus could take the Passion out of context.I would not rate the movie as entertaining or informative. The scenes of Jesus' torture and crucifixion I did not think were as macabre as many critics claimed it to be. (Apparently, the critics have not watched any slasher films in the past 20 years!)It was without a doubt a testament to Mel Gibson's faith and I am sure the faithful were as equally moved. Still it was a good movie and I would recommend the faithful or the open-minded film goer to see it."
1,JUST PLAIN TERRIBLE,"Mythology is good, but why would an insane man kill himself on a cross. Why wasn't he stoned to death like the culture of the Jews at that time. Also, what about the way in which the Romans actually killed people 2000 years ago, by hanging the cross up side down and burning the cross. I guess ""Jesus"" wouldn't been able to speak up side down, well the dramatics would have been senseless. Lots of hype for a crappie movie. "" Jesus"" go out and kill your self for the people today. HUH, sounds a little wack. I'll refer you to a better movie, ""I Spit on Your Grave""."
1,FUNNIEST EVER!!!,"THIS HAS TO BE THE FUNNIEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!! AND FOR THAT I GIVE 5 STARS. BUT FOR ACCURACY AND LOGIC I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE IT A -20. IT WAS FUNNY THOUGH, SINCE NONE OF THIS STUFF ACTUALLY HAPPENED, AND THERE JUST MAKING IT UP, CHRIST MONTY PYTHON'S VERSION WAS A LOT MORE ACCURATE THAN THIS GARBAGE."
2,kissing up to the vatican,"By all means watch this film and read the Bible, but please also read The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov or The Gospel According to Jesus Christ by Jose Saramago. The last thing we need in at the moment is blind faith."
3,"Eh, I thought the book was better.","As I watched this movie, I couldn't help but think: ""Where are the dinosaurs?"" Gibson didn't even include the one key moment in which Jesus, when dared by Simon, melts down 30 sticks of butter with his heat vision.Nonetheless, this movie still held plenty of laughs, but not enough to compare to the original book.I'd like to see Kevin Costner star in the sequel."
1,X rated,"The worse, the better.That was certainly Gibson s aim. And so many priests from many ""churches"" told their flock that the true story was even more ruthless than Gibson s,for our sins are always bigger than Chris's pain.Guilt is profitable,History knows. The handsome Gibson has become disgusting for me after this pedestrianly medieval film. The ""accuracy"" of Aramaic and Latin languages scarcely disguises its actual instinct: a sadomaso picture which should be kept inside the X Rated sector. Convicts received at that time 39 lashes, for the Hebraic law forbade 40 lashes.Romans used to respect local standards. Thus, Pilate washed hands and gave Jesus to Jew High Priest. Gibson was right about Semitic incrimination, in case there is guilt indeed or somebody accused ,once Jehova has decided to sacrifice His own Son. Therefore,we should thank Judas for our redemption. Unforgivable, in any way, is Gibson s bloody taste, worse than Jason s saw.Flavio J Morsch; Santa Cruz do Sul, Brazil"
4,this is an eye-opener!,"I will be honest, I am not the most religious person out there. I decided anyways to watch this movie in the theatre. The story line is very similiar to that in the bible but when i read this in the bible, i felt this was a harsh punishment and did not think too much of it. After watching this, one can get a better appreciation for Jesus. I was speechless half way through and I just tried to take in as much as I can. This was a horrendous act and by watching The Passion of the Christ, this changed my views on my religious background. I insist on everyone seeing this movie even if you are from a different religion."
1,"If you don't know the bible stories, you won't understand","For those who don't understand the christian bible, you will be lost for much of the movie."
3,The Passion of The Christ,"Mel Gibson's next film shoul be called 'Mad Ned' (Flanders) get the point bible bashers!Despite my sarcastic remark this is a well made film, with great acting. I just won't turn into a church going do gooder."
3,3.5,"Saw this film yesterday during a first date with a lady. We both thought that although this film was good, it was a little boring, and it did have a bit of a slow start. Many of the reviews on here and throughout the community say that this film is life changing...is it life changing...not sure I would go that far on this one...yes it is sad the things that they did to our Jesus Christ, and I am very proud of what he did for us and our sins. I love our Christ a lot! AMEN!!The film seemed to jump around a bit...a major plus for this film is the subtitles that ran across the screen were timed very well, and they were easy to read...they did not distract from the film at all.Is this film a bomb??? No not at all..it is worth seeing for the most part...but just beware that it can drag just a bit...James Caviezal along with the rest of the cast did a great job in the film..."
2,funny if stupid,"i went to the cinema to watch this and got shouted at by some arrogant fundamentalist. at a dramatic point in the film during the caning when it went quiet i quipped loudly to my friend ""does he die at the end?"" it was hilarious, you should have seen this guy.poor film, it just gets ridiculous. i think the director get some sort of erotic religious thrill out of this."
2,The Passion of the Christ,"I knew when I first saw previews for this movie and started hearing things about it, that I would not want to go see it, and if, for some reason, I did end up watching it, I would not like it. I was correct.First and foremost, this movie was incredibly boring. A good majority of the movie is spent watching Jesus get beat, hit, cut, or stabbed. I see no reason why anyone would enjoy watching this unless he is a sadist.The movie would get much lower than a five if it weren't for the scenes where it shows flashbacks that Jesus has with him spending time with his apostles. These scenes are uplifting, interesting, and sometimes humorous. The rest of the movie is just a bloody mess that seems to focus more on making you cringe than making you feel sympathetic."
2,Not for people who want to think...,"Three words: money making machine.This movie is realy great for CNN and MTV generation: lot of action, very few thoughs.Don't get me wrong: movie is ok (especialy for gore movie lovers). Director, operator and main actor did their best. But all this hysteria about move is just a very, very good entertainment and marketing. (Bravissimo, marketing heads!)If you realy want to think about ""great and eternal"" things, watch Antonioni, Pasolini, Scorsese, Bergman, De Sica etc. works.Even ""Finding Nemo"" is more about faith, than Gibson's movie."
4,A little too religious perhaps?,"Of course it is! it's the story of the son of God, so obviously it's not for little kiddies,people into heavy metal and rap or Executive producers. The story was good, although, I did feel Gibson did exploit the religious congregation a bit, just to make a lot of money (unexpectedly?); which just means, he's a normal Catholic man - just kidding dude, I liked the film. It was brutally honest - and if you're going by the bible, historically accurate. I much point out, that the whole story is in Hebrew, so if you're going to watch it, get the bifocals out to see the subtitles!"
5,Please review the movie not your personal oppinion,Everyone reviewing these movies are citing their personal religious beliefs and downing Christianity and personally attacking mel Gibson. Whatever Dudes. Here is a movie reviewThe movie was indeed graphic as was gladiator and the patriot which i also loved. Some events are graphic just like some video games are graphic get over it people. We see worse stuff on the evening news. The coolest part i thought of the movie was that you hardly even had to read the subtitles which really speaks volume for the directing and acting. Well just thought i'd give an actual review on the movie. Oh yeah and it's a true story how cool is that. Oh and i am sure i am going to get blasted here for saying its true but even athiests believe that there was a Christ.
5,INCREDIBLE,"The History of the passion is presented in a very realistic and creative way. Impressive. The movie shows the brutality of the crucifixion as a punishment but at the same time shows the great Love with which Jesus, his mother and his friends faced the moment. After the movie I felt that I needed to make His sacrifice worth it by doing the right thing."
3,passion of christ,This is a good movie but the subject is very painful to me... Very well done.. I was concerned that I could get thru it again.
5,Crying for Jesus,"All I can say about this video is that if your looking for a video to help people understand what Jesus has done for the sinners of this world you have found it,,This video of Jesus is the most powerful movie I believe that has ever been made,,It is in Hebrew but you can watch it without even reading the words on the screen or listening to the words and you will still know what the story is about,,You will not be able to watch this movie without shedding tears of sorrow as you watch our loving God give his son's life so that we can be forgiven.I would recommend this video to anyone,,The saved and unsaved in hopes that you will see and feel God's love."
5,"A powerful, epic work","This DVD really did not need ""extras"" (those will abound from supporters and detractors in the future). The powerful cinematography and score did justice to the story as prophesied in the Old Testament and fulfilled in the New.Obviously Mel Gibson used artistic license in many scenes, particularly with the character of satan and most of the children(!) Yet most of the Scripture is followed, even in it's most brutal aspects... except for Isaiah 52:14, which predicted Messiah would be unrecognizably disfigured to the horror of those who saw Him.Gibson has said that he backed off from the true level of violence done to Jesus so that the audience would not disconnect with Caviezel's portrayal.Over all, a classic spiritual film - thoughtfully and respectfully presented -- which will take it's deserved place as one of the best of all time."
4,A spiritually moving movie!,"The Passion of the Christ is a wonderful movie. Mel Gibson had a lot of guts to make a movie about Jesus told in such a violent way(which by the way is the way it happened...sad isn't it). Most people know that the movie isn't a happy movie that you can watch without crying. The movie is the most violent movie that I have ever seen. Because I heard the movie was so violent and gory, I was very skeptical about seeing this movie. But when my friend said that the movie changed her life, I decided to watch it with her. I ended up holding her hand almost the whole time (until the end of course because I needed both of my hands to wipe all of the tears away from my eyes. I have never cried so much in a movie. Even though the movie is very sad and extremely hard to watch, there are a few happy parts in the movie(especially the very end). I suggest any Christian and especially non-Christian to watch this spiritually moving movie."
3,can someone please comment on does this special definitive blue ray edition have more special features than the special editionm,2 scenes were special....the demons shown with judas and mary splashing jesus with watercan someone please comment on did the special edition blue ray have more special features than the special edition dvd
5,you have NO clue,everybody saying Oh I wish there were more scenes of is life rather then the brutal scenes in this film well mel gibson said this was a film about that last 12 hours of jesus's lifenot about the life of jesus you fanatics out there just stop Im tired of all the crying from you people
1,Good Cinematography - but that is all.,"I am willing to give Gibson credit for good camera work.After that - Nothing else. This film is meant to tell the ""true Story"" of the Jesus mythology. Being that Jesus is a myth there is no true story.The fact is the myth is borrowed, verbatim, from other mythologies that predate Christianity by about 2,900 years. Read The Secret Origins of the Bible by Tim Callahan.Those who accept this as truth have got to learn to question things in an intelligent manner. If GOD gave you a BRAIN he might want you to take it out of the garage for a drive.If something is ""REAL"" it will stand up to scrutiny and unbiased testing. That said you would have a better chance of proving Star Wars is a true story! After all it was in a Galxy Far, far away."
1,A Religion that couldn't prevent it's flock from doing the worst horrors in this world,This is a religion that never helped its adherents to be moral. No wonder they have done these.- Inquisition in Spain and Goa- Crusades- Ethnic cleansing of American Indians- SIavery- Lynchings- The Anti Chinese league of the Americas- Jim Crowe- The HoIocaust. Read the antisemitic rantings of Martin Luther the founder of the Protestant movement that was the impetus for the Holocaust.- Separate churches for blacks and whites in the bible belt.- BIood Iibel. Read in Wikipedia about this.. OMG! What eviI!In today's world the vast majority of so the called christians are fortunately social christians (church for weddings and funerals only). These social christians use their own moral compass and reject all the vile doctrine of this godforsaken religion called christianity.
1,Horrible movie!,"Don't waste your time with this exagerated depiction of Jesus Christ. It seems that it only helps to create more hysteria in easily led people. Instead, spend your hard earned money in something constructive."
2,THE MEDIA BLITZ MUST STOP!,"Usually when there is such a media blitzkrieg behind a movie it means there isn't much to the movie. Such is the case here. I've seen the movie and simply put, it plays like ""Lethal Weapon"" with robes and sandals. I respect what Mr.Gibson tried to do here, but truthfully, he stepped way over the line with the gore and violence. And the movie lost 3 stars with me because of it. His subject matter should not have had buckets of blood dumped on it, it deserved more respectful treatment. And as for the media, the target audience for this film is adults. It's in theaters now, we get it. If we want tickets, we'll get those too. Enough is enough. Find something else to talk about every 30 seconds, Please!!"
3,Lethal Weapon,"As an atheist, I was able to steer clear of the spiritial mumbo jumbo and see this story purely as the human tragedy that it was. Jesus was a victim of bigotry and intollerance, just as Joan of Arc, Anne Frank, and Martin Luther King, Jr. were, and this unflinching portrayal of man's inhumanity towards man shows that in spades. It's enough to make you want to believe in fairy tales -- but we all know how distructive that can be. Don't we?"
4,What? No uncut version?,"This set includes two version of the film - the original theatrical cut and the less gruesome unrated rerelease (which was still technically R-rated). There's also tons of features, including commentaries, several documentaries (including a feature-length Making-Of), and production stills. Whether you own the previous release or not, this is certainly the version you need to own. Unfortunately, the ""original"" uncut version of the film is not included, as the MPAA forced numerous heavy cuts in order for The Passion to be released with a ""mere"" R rating (as opposed to a dreaded NC-17). Considering the subject matter and target audience, it's unlikely we will ever see The Passion in the form Gibson originally intended. Politics and censorship... what a shame."
1,Brutal Film,Brutal filmI just returned from watching this film and the only words that come to mind are:GraphicRealisticBrutalExtremeIf you are looking for a film for the shock value only this makes Cannibal Holocaust or Day of the Dead look like a walk in the park.The feel of the film is a direct copy of Gladiator both cinematically and musically. The violence begins almost from the beginning and doesn't end until the credits roll. I should add excessive graphic violence. ...
1,To Quote South Park...,"""That wasn't a movie, that was a Snuff film!""The brutal truth couldn't have been presented in more clarity. Watch the episode of South Park, the Passion of the Jew and you will see exactly what I mean. Go ahead and bash me but inside you know these words to be true."
1,"He died for our sins, no really, wait.....ummmmm","For some reason, the cultural manifestation that is Jesus embodies everthing that is wrong with our country: constantly worrying and contemplating the life of someone who never even existed. When will you people get it: Jesus is a fabricated entity, created in order to get the masses to focus on something other than their mundane and meaningless lives. There is NO historical evidence (testimonies don't count) that an individual named Jesus ever roamed this Earth; this means that he was invented like the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus so that people can find some type of meaning in a seemingly chaotic world.You have now been enlightened!"
1,Perpetuation of a MYTH,"The movie is not worth rating. It is anti-semitic, ""anti-christ"" and only reaffirms the fact that the only ""christian"" who ever lived died on the cross. However, it is another worthy addition to the collection of fairy tales that make up the mythology of ""christianity."""
1,"Sorry, Mel",I have to wonder why any one would think that spending two hours watching a man being slowly tortured to death would be a good idea. It is sure not suspense. Everyone knows how this one ends. I sure hope that this does not inspire more violence and cruelty.
5,"Hard to watch, but worth evry second","They are right, this movie is violent. I shows clearly the suffering our lord went through to save us, but it beautifuly shot, and edited. The movie is the only movie I have ever considered seeing in the theator twice. I already want to pre-order my DVD. MUST SEE Film of the year. I pray it does well at the oscars next year."
4,watched this artistic rendering,"Nice artistic rendering of the last days of Christ. Not really violent, but it had a taste of old horror films like RoseMary's Baby and The Omen, in the scene of the Devil? with a devil's baby? and also scenes of children turning into devil's faces, that to me was the scariest part, Violence? not really nothing horrendous like most movies out today, no real violence in this. Movie done artistically, and apparently Gibson has a real belief, because of the ruining of the Jewish Temple at the end of the movie makes sure of that. Other than that, you are not sure whether Jesus is a criminal or truly the son of God. All in all not a bad movie. If I sit through it enthralled, then ok, its a 4 or 5 rating. In this case a 4 rating, because there may be some racist attitudes towards Jews slightly in this movie, but all in all good well done watchable movie."
3,It's good.,"I would recommend this if your a true believer since the movie made his career. other than that, not really."
5,"...OH, IT'S ONLY A MOVIE...","Lent is over, the people who crowded the theaters to see ""The Passion of The Christ"" have long gone home, and this brutal, violent, moving movie is now being viewed in other countries of this world. I, for one, was anxious to see ""The Passion..."". I never really thought acutely about the last day of the life of Jesus. I watched the movie, and my heart literally ached. You could have heard a pin drop in the theater, people were so focused. This movie upset me, and haunted my thoughts for days on end. If you see this movie, you will not be able to dismiss it casually from your thoughts. You might try by thinking, ""Oh, it's only a movie..."", but that won't work. Your God-given intelligence will quietly point out to you that there is a Son of God...who lived as a man on this earth...who suffered and died for us...because He loves us so."
5,Moving,"Having had to wait for the movie to be released in France, I had read much about this movie. Nothing I had read really prepared me for what I saw. I believe that Mel Gibson has made a very realistic movie. To see what Christ went through for us to forgive us of our sins...simply amazing. I have only seen the movie twice and I don't know if I could handle seeing it again for along time."
4,A film to encourage thought and family discussion,"I saw this film with my 12 year old daughter. I did not base her ability to see this movie on her age but on her maturity leval. There were times she covered her eyes but continued to watch.After it was over she and I spent several hours talking about beliefs-a topic she had never opened up on before-and I explained a few things she didn't get.This movie is amazing. It is incredibly true to the scriptures and serves as a reminder of what the Son of God did for us.Yes-it is very graphic, yes it can be hard to watch at moments.But is important to watch.I plan on purchasing this as soon as its out on DVD."
1,Anyone who has any intellectual dignity should be repulsed and disgusted by its simplistic message !,"Basically what Gibson tries to say is that since Christ suffered a lot on the cross you better accept him or you'll suffer in hell, like Christ suffered on the cross, for eternity.See I refuse to worship a God or a Christ primarily because of my libertarian (sort of in Ayn Rand style) objections. The thought of worshiping anyone: king, master, government, god, whatever, utterly disgusts me. And I don't appreciate Gibson threatening me with his movie.I don't think the movies is as much anti-Semitic as it's anti-intellectual, anti-humanistic and anti-libertarian. The movie is an emotional garbage for ignorant fundamentalist masses ! Anyone who has any intellectual dignity should be repulsed and disgusted by its simplistic message !"
1,A work of fiction - nothing more,"Christ is to Adult...as Santa Claus is to Child. What kind of sick mind would let their kid watch this pornographic trash? The kind of person who thinks ""Jesus"" is going to ""come back"". The type of person who believes MILLIONS are going to ""HELL"", if they are ""unsaved"". The fact that this MYTH of Jesus and the Bible continues to hold sway the world over is nauseating. This religious nonsense has gone on long enough. Throw this sick fantasy away and instead use common sense."
1,Dangerous,"Why do I dislike this movie? This movie is a very nice way to give Christian fanatics lots of ammo. And I'd like to tell you fanatics of any kind can be dangereous, not just Muslim fanatics as many Americans tend to be. Fanatics of NyQuil could potentially be dangerous, so don't give Christian fanatics something else to use against anyone who may happen to have a different belief that they do.Did Jesus go through this? Something like it, probably not exactly. Does Mel Gibson deserve the money he makes? No. Did Mel Gibson take a risk? No. He already had a large audience that would go see the movie even if no one else would. But he knew everyone would go see it because it's controversial. Controversy make a lot of money, look at Eminem.This movie is not a life changing experience because it is a movie. People shouldn't be guilted into Christianity because they saw an actor pretending to be Jesus get tortured."
5,Awesome Must See Movie,"No matter how strong you are in your faith...this is an awesome must see movie! I was brought to tears several times throughout the movie and amazed at how closely it followed the scripture. For those who say it's anti semitic...it is not! We are ALL the reason He was on that cross. He died for ALL our sins. Not just for the Jews or the Romans but for ALL of us. As for it being violent and gory...NOT! Read your Bible, it is exactly how it happened and if you can't handle reading it, don't go see it. It is a movie about His crucifiction...not a comedy. Take lots of tissue and be prepared to sit in on a time when our savior died and rose again...it will take your breath away! God bless you ALL! And to Mel Gibson...a special thank you for this project, may it open the door to many more religious films about our precious savior...our Lord Jesus Christ!"
3,Mother Superior jumped the gun...,"Still not as moving as ""Jesus of Nazareth""... and strangely enough, I found the crucifixtion in that film almost more disturbing to watch than the ""Passion""'s gore fest. It almost tried to show too much, which took away from something that none of us have any proof actually happened that exact way. But this is one man's vision.... and Mel accomplished what he apparently set out to do, so... kudos to you Mel."
2,The book is much better,Hollywood (as is evident with this film) has the tendency to distort the words of Jesus and manipulate His word in order to promote their agenda. Do yourself a favor and buy the book instead of this movie!
3,Good - but needs arm strength,"We bought this composter because it seemed the rotating aspect would be easier than manual turning. Possibly - but the bin gets very heavy and is hard to push. We think it needs some lever or handle to grab, as it can be hard to get a grip on. We're hoping warmer weather will make it easier. It looks good enough that you can have it closer to the house, which is an advantage."
2,Can't listen anymore,"This CD is headed for the stack that is located at Danhole Peloser Weird Al's house. This was hailed as one of the best prog of recent years. After one listen, my ears needed to be disinfected. Modern prog sounding does not mean good in this case. I didn't like the arrangements nor did I like the sound. Pure boredom revolution"
4,Good but Slow Read,"Great story but very slow. Nora hit the spot though with the so real situations.I was able to watch each different character go through the good and the bad in a life. It shined a light on growing up celebrity, the not so good parts.A nice ""whodunit"" story.And I was upset at the person whodunit and was shocked they would stoop that low.This story did take you on a ups and downs ride and in and outs of the questions that you have. If you guessed at it you would be so far off. Far off but then again in the end you accepted the fact that friends and family just may not be as the seem.I loved the storyline and the characters were so real and down to earth, even though they were celebrities. I understood their trials and tribulations. Very nice story and pays homage to the heart."
4,Good ol' Nora,I like Nora. She always has a twist toward the end to keep you guessing. It's a nice book to go to bed with.
5,My Favorite Nora Roberts Book!,This is one of the best books I have read in a long time and the BEST book I have read by Nora Roberts. This story was not at all what I was expecting. Nora Roberts is constantly suprising me with her character variety. Almost every chapter introduces or resolves another mystery. Only during the first 50 or so pages was I struggling to stay entertained. This was only due to the character introductions. Then I couldn't stop reading! I highly recommend Public Secrets!
3,Not Great. (Sorry!),"There aren't many books by NR that I don't like, as she is so talented and writes on a variety of informed topics, i.e. ballet, horse racing, Irish history, among just a few.But this one wasn't rich in its story and the characters failed to ring true, especially to their professions. For instance, I never could accept Brian in the role of lead singer for a band, he just didn't fit this profile at all. And I wanted to feel his music, his singing, but that never happened. We readers should have felt the music as if we were in the audience, or at least off stage.In most of NR's books, the reader truly comes to know the characters, but not so in this one. Brian and the rest were dull, and I really didn't like the way this story unfolded."
1,Public Secrets,"This has to be the worse Nora Roberts book, I have bought. I did not even finish the book. Nora Roberts can do much better. To much violence, use of drugs, and more four letter words than was necessary. I usually read and pass on books, this one I did not even finish, it went into the trash. Did not want to waste my time with it. I was so disappointed after enjoying Vision In White."
4,Captured my attention,"A fairly gripping read, however the ending was a bit predictable. A bit long winded in some places, but quite enjoyable overall"
4,New Amazon User,I was given a Nora Roberts book as a present and enjoyed reading it therefore when I got my Amazon I downloaded Public Secrets as my first purchase and was very satisfied with the book. It kept me interested throughout from cover to cover. I am really looking forward to reading more of Nora Roberts books and hope they are all as entertaining as Public Secrets.
4,Horrible editing on Kindle,"I'm sure this will be a great book; Nora Roberts is an excellant writer. I downloaded this on my Kindle and I'm only on the 2nd chapter and there are a ton of typos. I will continue reading because I know the book will be great, but the typos are very annoying!"
2,Very little romance,"I would have liked to see more of Michael and Emma together. For the majority of the book Emma was with Drew (absolutely no romance there) or she was nowhere near Michael. I did get that is was suppose to be endearing that Michael's feelings for her never waned over the years, but the distance did not make for a great romance. By the time that they finally spent quality time together and were in a quasi relationship the book was almost over. Dissapointing, because Michael was one of Nora's few male leads that wasn't so standoffish with the female yet he did not get to be near her.The book was not lacking in suspense however. It did have excessive drug use, but I guess that what comes with the rock star story."
4,Mainstream jazz at its best...buy it!,"Typically solid performance by Scott. Dave McKenna, however, carries this CD. There is no need for a bass player here, Dave's left hand does more than any bass player could with walking bass lines, stride, strumming, etc. This is a fun CD to listen to, old standards given a fresh, swinging sound by absolute masters."
2,Crummy sound engineering ruins a great gig,"I guess Dave McKenna plays with ""awesome technique"" here, as the liner notes claim. I'll have to take it on faith, since the lousy sound balance ruins the presentation. Scott Hamilton's tenor sax is so overmiked, it drowns out most of what McKenna and drummer Jake Hanna are doing. McKenna sounds like he's comping Hamilton all the time, and Hanna like he's in the studio next door.It's a shame. The selections are great, and when I can hear past Hamilton's sax I can tell there's a good trio working in there.By way of contrast, check out any of Blue Note's reissues of great 1950's and 60's tenor saxmen playing with a combo. Just one example: Hank Mobley's sessions with Herbie Hancock, Harold Mabern, Wynton Kelly and other great piano artists. Perfect sync AND perfect sound balance.Too bad Concord dropped the ball here."
2,Laser dermatologist,I did not like this books at all. Don't know why I finished it but I did. I have finished 4 books since so it is hard for me to remember it really well. But I keep track of all my books that Iam reading and when I am done I rate them and looking back I gave this a 2. Which in looking back further through my books I see that a 2 is the lowest rating I have ever given any of my books.It seems to have been written by a juvenile. As for the main character he was paranoid for one and had difficulty relating to people the few friends he had were also juvenile. I wish I could write more but I don't remember it so well. I remember I wanted to write something right after but I have to wait until I get an email to prompt me to review.Pass this one up folks unless you are a teen.Nancy Moore
4,London Embassy,"Paul Theroux is probably best known as a travel writer and the author/creator of such films as ""The Mosquito Coast"" and ""Half Moon Street."" First person narrative of an American foreign service official who has been posted to London. A biting, sarcastic, and satirical series of stories."
4,Like it but really heavy,"This is a good hole punch, can punch through quite a few pages at once. The only thing is that you really need to push down heavily to make the holes."
4,Nice punch!,"Good heavy duty 3 hole punch which can be adjusted for 2 hole with a little patience. Does nice job, however the process of adjusting it for 2 hole punch could have been made easier with some design modifications."
4,"A fast paced, laugh riot","This book grabs you right at the beginning, and it kept my attention. Very funny and light hearted romance. Some pretty steamy scenes and likable charaters. It was an interesting, unique set up for a romance. Very good. If you haven't read it I also Highly recommend Improper English."
3,"funny at times, but still only a so-so read","I was expecting a lot from Katie Macalister in this book, but it didn't quite deliver like her other two books did. Tessa's bodily functions were not funny, but humiliating, scenes. Both Tessa's and Max's lines to each other seem really forced - who is truly THAT candid with a new love interest? They just laid it all out there and there were no real obstacles to overcome in their relationship. The so-called obstacles were laughable: the five year age differnece between a 39 and 35 year old, the daughter was just a brat, the sister just seemed jealous of Tessa, the brother-in-law was just insane, and the ""servants"" were just all (to put it British) MAD. I can't believe I really read the whole book. It wasn't endearing that Max was angry at Tessa ALL THE TIME, but still wanted her body anyway - seemed shallow. Just was not a good story line altogether. Read Ms. Macalister's other books instead of this one."
5,Wonderful,Great book. Katie MacAlister is a wonderful author and this is just one of many great reads she's written.
2,Does not deliver the Victorian aspect,"I loved Regency House Party on PBS. Watching people interact in a period setting was very interesting. I was so excited about this book being set in the Victorian era. The premise is great, but Katie does not deliver. I felt that the reality show was a weak backdrop to an unlikely romance. The main characters jump into bed way too quickly and I don't understand their attraction to one another. The reader doesn't get a good character sketch of the hero or heroine.The book could have been really good. Interaction between upstairs and downstairs helped the reader understand what daily life was like in the late 1800's, but nothing else did. What did Tessa do all day? We don't know, we were never told. We the reader only know how she spent her evenings."
4,Interesting,"I liked the concept of a reversible pillowcase, but the extra bonus was realising it stayed on the pillows better. Satin usually slides all over, these don't. Can't wait for the next sale to buy a couple more."
2,Stamina Level 2 Aero pilates DVD,"This video starts out slow with the simple movements. However, when the more difficult moves are being taught it is too fast and you can watch and watch but the movements are not clear . There is no explanation of the movements and no warnings to the viewer if they are doing these movements for the first time. I have been doing level 1 for over 1 year. I keep watching this video but there are still some of the moves that are not clear to me. I am hoping that they will revise this DVD and do more explaining of the movements . I have incorporated some of the movements in Level 2 with my workout but not all due to worry of injury."
1,best of porter wagoner,"I am very dissatisfied with this cassette--I already own The Best of Porter Wagonercd collection, and none of the songs on this one appear there--if fact they are songs I have never heard, and I am very familiar with his songs.Incicentally, I don't recall purchasing this--I don't normally purchase without first seeing a list of the songs on a given cassette or cd.Very dissatisfied customer, Butch Ramsey"
5,Excellent Book for Travelers,This book has everything you need. You don't need to look elsewhere when it comes to traveling. It covers all the essential travel sites along with the hard to find ones that you'll find just what you're looking for. Whether you're taking a road trip or flying I found it very helpful. I was booking a trip to Europe and found it useful because it listed all the countries and cities that I wanted to research before the trip. Great work!
2,Not fantasy but a satire of fantasy,"I generally like Heinlein's novels but this one was just plain terrible. First off, it's not fantasy but a satire of fantasy conventions, from ridiculously-dumb minotaurs to silly dragons. Most of the book centres around the relationship between Gordon and an otherworldly queen who guides him on his quest. The dialogue is classic Heinlein, but the witty banter that fits so well into most of his modern-day works grates terribly in what is supposed to be a fantasy setting (but isn't, as we find out in the end). This is more of a commentary on 1950s marriage, relationships, cultural norms and sex than anything to do with what we consider fantasy novels today. The sex part is especially annoying as Heinlein seems to have had a polygamy fetish and manages to insert it rather crudely into every novel he ever wrote, and it's even worse here.Short version: not a fantasy novel, not enjoyable."
4,Not your usual fantasy,"This is definitely a tongue-in-cheek adventure book, littered with Heinlein's usual musings on how the world could/ought to be. It's difficult to put into words quite what this novel does - the roles seem typical: hero, lady, squire. But I had the feeling that throughout the entire book, poor Oscar was always the kid who never understood the joke. No matter how heroic, or how thoughtful Oscar seemed, the other characters always seemed more full of pity for him. It changes the book from a typical adventure fantasy to something else entirely, though I'm not sure I could categorize it. Possibly simply the Death of a Hero.The societal aspect and Heinlein's views of Earth were amusing and even though the adventure part of the book slows down greatly after the Quest, the remainder makes for a fairly involved, thought-provoking read, questioning everything from a person's place in the world to why we do not practice something as vital as the art of making love.An entertaining book."
3,"breezy, funny, diverting, but not memorable","Heinlein as usual maintains an emotional distance with his characters, avoiding soft introspection. That breaks down in the final third, when the plot is effectively resolved, and the hero, who has literally conquered the universe, starts to feel useless. Fifties colloquialisms and inside jokes abound. A few discourses on libertarianism, but nothing too heavy."
3,A good beginners book,I would recommend this book for someone that is just starting out in their career to keep as a refresher (i.e. moulding and wigmaking sections were great)or for a person who has not studied at all. The book is VERY basic on most other levels however does give a good insight into the who's who on set which most other books lack.... 3/5 for me.
5,High quality,"I was very pleasantly surprised when I received my bracelet that the quality of the pearls and leather exceeded my expectations based on the price. The bracelet is very comfortable to wear and the pearls have a wonderful lustre. This bracelet definitely holds it's own against the higher-priced, name-brand version!"
4,Nice Work!!!!!!!!!,"Not just Roy Ayers, but the personnel on here are HOT!!!!!!!Especially Joe Henderson who plays a WICKED solo on the title tune and on ""In the Limelight"". Sounds a lot like Michael Brecker would 10-15 years later. Guess who copied whose sound? Props to Joe Henderson...!!! In fact, even with Herbie Hancock on the piano, Joe Henderson steals the show. Every solo he takes is amazing!"
3,too small,"The one I have for my other hand was a medium, so I ordered the same. When I got it, it was just too small. It was really tight on my arm, And that was without pulling the straps tight. I had to rip out the stitches of stretchy part under the straps and sew it back on where it should be in the first place. Now it works just fine, but if you have fat arms like me, look for another brand."
3,Bulky & Tight Fit,"This splint is bulky and is 1/2""-3/4"" longer than other splints I have used making it awkward for some uses. It fits quite tight before you even fasten the straps. I ordered according to my hand size too. The metal splint did not fit my palm well until I hammered it down to fit better so it wouldn't stick out away from my palm. On the good side it has 2 stays on it for support. The material looks of good quality."
2,Could have been good but...,"One of the male speakers has an extremely confusing manner of pronouncing the ""t"" as a ""k"" in feminine verb forms. I played the tapes over and over repeating these errors many times before figuring this out. Now I'm trying to unlearn this stupidity. There is no book (transcription) along with the tape - so you are totally on your own, with no way to verify if you are hearing what you think you might be hearing. The aggravation I received from this course was 10 times worse than the amount I paid. Don't waste your money or especially your time on this course - unless you're a comic and want Egyptians to laugh at your idiotic pronunciation."
5,All the other reviews say it as well as I can...,"This is the most hilarious book I have ever read. I'm only half-way through at the moment, but one night at bed time I had the giggles to bad that the more I tried not to laugh the harder I laughed. I had to get up and go get a glass of water and sit in the kitchen to collect myself. Read several of the 5 star reviews, then buy the book. It's worth it."
2,"Ok, but vocals too sugary","I got this album because I loved Toca Me (and the other edit, Toca's Miracle, both from the first album, ""Toca""). However, the music was much less inspired in this album. That's ok when vocals are superb, but the vocals here are a little too sugary-sweet for my taste, and the emotional content seems a little exagerated. Overall, I don't dislike the album but it seems like cheese-pop. Ok to listen to, but not a strong performance."
4,"Cute, appealing girl that makes nice albums","Tyler Collins (born 9-1-66 in Harlem, New York) had one big pop hit and a couple of smaller R&B hits with her previous album ""Girls Nite Out."" Though this follow up album did not spawn any hits on either chart, it's a catchier, more well produced album than her first effort. Songs like ""It Doesnt Matter"" and ""Good Things Take Time"" have more of the funky vibes that early 90s R&B should have, and I think that this album deserves to have gotten more attention than ""Girls Nite Out""."
3,Disavowal of Double Consciousness,"The Black Atlantic is an attempt to call to attention the contribution of the slaves to the progression of modernity. Submitting himself to the operation of Western modernity, Gilroy recognizes that there exists a double consciousness in the black flesh, that is, the black sees his own image through the 'other.' However, as to me, we should find the third term--denegation to revolute against the metaphysic difference and cultural strength instead. Denegation in its very essence is not to break down the established but rather to hold a critical eye on the contigent cultural transformation and has the self recognize the alterity."
1,Boring and empty,"This book is a waste of your precious time. It gives you nothing, tells you nothing, makes nothing happen, while eating up pages and jumping erratically from character to character all of whom have zero actual personality or depth.This book is written in conversation speak so whole pages go by with internal (and boring) dialogue and people talking about sandwiches. I'm sure this is done to make it seem fast paced and exciting, but it's really just page filler with zero substance.A good mystery hints at what is going on. It even leads you astray so that you think one thing when it is really another, suspect one villain when they are really innocent while you fall in love with the betrayer. This book doesn't do that either.Nothing going for it. Don't bother."
