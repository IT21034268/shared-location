1,NOT Cozy,"This book does not meet my definition of cozy. Way too much info about the murder victim's wound. Way too much graphic sex, and I only read the first 14 pages. Also whiny main character. I'm glad I got this book from the library instead of purchasing."
2,"""BEATS ARE PHAT!""","IF YOU LOVE TIGHT BEATS AND LIKE TO DANCE, THAN THIS IS A CD FOR YOU. THE BEATS ARE CATCHY AND HOOKS ARE GREAT. ""WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT ME"" IS A REAL HIT WHEN IT COMES TO BEATS. UNFORTUNALTY, THE VOCALS ARE VERY, VERY WEAK. VERY WEAK, WHERE IT COMES TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS VERY ANNOYING. I SAW THE GIRLS IN LAS VEGAS AND THEY ALSO NEED SOME MORE EXPERIENCE ON STAGE. BUT I AM LOOKING FOWARD IN THE RELEASE OF THIER SECOND ALBUM. LIKE WHAT THE PEOPLE SAY,""SECOND IS THE BEST""! GOOD LUCK, ONE VOICE"
4,Pretty good cd,"I think this is a great cd. I don't see why people are coming down on the vocals. The slow songs especially have very rich vocals. I've seen them perform live and they don't disappoint. Addressing the name change issue, this was not really in their hands. When they signed with MCA records they couldn't carry over the name. When they went back to Kamikaze Records, they reclamed the name under One Vo1ce...Anyway, all in all I highly recommend this album and I look forward to the next one."
1,R&B is not for everybody,"The measuring stick of R&B music is the black voice which is very difficult to duplicate. I'm not a hater but just appreciate the skills that my race continue to produce. So my standards are a lot higher. I give them props for making as far as they did, but no let's no over hype these artist just because they sing R&B. Keep the standards high."
2,food mill,this food mill has a blade that is too far from the grate. You waste alot of food with this mill. I have returned this product.
2,Slow space,This is uneventful for me. I am always waiting for something dramatic to happen. It puts me to sleep and that is why I say slow space. Very repeatative beats.
3,Kinda fun,"I've been working out for almost six years and I usually prefer step tapes. I didn't like Gilad's step tape because it was too repetitive for me. I get bored easily with work out tapes. Not this one. This one is fun. There are some moves where I feel like I'm doing Riverdance. It is hard on the ankles, which is why I didn't give it a higher rating.There is one part where Gilad slips while doing a move. I myself like that part. It's nice to see the person leading the exercise actually mess up. It also shows how much the rest of the group relies on him to lead them because they totally screw up after he stops. I love the part of doing my own thing for thirty seconds before he gets us all back on track. It breaks it up nicely.What I also like about this video is it's thirty minutes of aerobics and the warm up is not included as part of the thirty minutes, like some other work out tapes I've done.I've done a lot of videos since I started working out but this one is worth holding on to."
4,Solid Workout,"This is a good, 45 minute workout. The only thing wrong is that I don't feel I get as much benefit from it as I do from other Gilad tapes, which is odd because the aerobics is 30 mins long! I suppose b/c this is only an aerobics video, you don't work on other areas with Gil ususally focuses on, such as arms, abs, buttocks, and legs. If you like aerobics, there can be no better video. If you wanna get a more complete workout, I suggest some of his other work."
5,Fun AND effective,"I've kept at this tape four to five days a week for a month. My knee and ankle pain gradually went away as I got used to the high impact moves. Most importantly, I have trimmed down and my clothes fit better. The cuing is excellent and there are no hard to follow dance steps. The music is upbeat and suited to the workout. I think this workout IS fun, now that I am used to it. I look forward to doing this workout several days a week. Gilad's Fat Burning Workout has me in much better shape with increased stamina, and I am dripping with perspiration by the end. My other workouts are almost too easy for me now. This is definitely for the intermediate to advanced level, although some of the high impact moves could be modified to low impact or marching in place for beginners. Gilad is the perfect instructor- instructing on form and completing the entire workout with you."
2,Shop around first.........,"After doing what I thought was a lot of shopping around, and searching ebay and the like, I decided on this unit. As the other reviewers have stated, the remote is useless, and when it does work has a 5 second delay.The manual is fair, to say the least. A reasonably intelligent person can figure out most functions by just playing around it though.the most disapointing thing is the record quality. Even though I am using a high end toshiba camera, with 570 lines of resolution,and excellent low light capabilites and recording at the highest allowed settings , I doubt if anything it records could be used to identify a crook, unless he is 2 feet away staring directly into the camera !Try to find a unit with record resolution higher than this one, is my suggestion!"
2,you think it's working...but it's not??,"We are very frustrated. We record 24/7 on this (continual mode - so it should never be 'full' and just keep the most recent footage) and by all indication, it was recording...however in doing the search and play back today, the only viewable footage is from 7 months ago! Samsung said it could be a bad sector on the hard drive...or some other issue. A lot of good it is to have a security system that you THINK is working when in reality hasn't been....and find this out a day after someone breaks in. If we can recover the most recent footage, I may change my tune. As of now, I'd recommend to find a RELIABLE security system. And for those who have this unit: stop recording and check your saved footage periodically to be sure your unit really is recording. Very disappointed..."
5,Dazzling book of incredible photographs and delightful poetry,"I had to add this review to clear any misunderstandings resulting from the only other review here, at this time, which, perhaps unintentionally, makes this book sound like a book of photographs.This beautiful hardcover book of impeccable quality, is also a book of poetry, edited by the highly accomplished Naomi Shihab Nye.The poems are coupled with the dazzling photographs in a dance that celebrate the mystery of life, under these Texas skies."
1,Death of a Political Plant,"This was my first experience with a Ripley book and I was very disappointed. Since the book's setting is very close to where I live, I found her descriptions of the environment and the characters interesting. However, the story dragged on and on and the solution to the crime was contrived."
4,Boring,The book is interesting but starts to get very boring. There is also to much violence included in this book
4,Good overview,"A good general introduction to these minor prophets, but very sparse comments on individual verses. Bibliography is best part of the book."
3,Running out of fuel.......,"This is another great novel in the series, and once again I was captivated. However, the book could be cut in half if the authors didn't relive every item from the previous books - everyone knows who Raymie was, who Irene was, Bruce, and so on. I'm heart-broken that the authors seem to be taking away from the potential to witness and appear to be ""cashing in"" on the series. Is 12 books really necessary? One big novel would have sufficed. But the ever present dollar makes this more of a ""story"" rather than a witnessing tool."
2,Lose the padding!,"Like a few other posts, I agree that Jenkins and LaHaye sacrificed content for cash cow in this sixth installment of an otherwise exciting series. It takes four hundred pages to tell this segment of the tale whereas the actual plot events can be summarized in about two hundred words! Please, Jerry, Tim and Tyndale - either slow down the production line or just shorten it - if your story is only 100,000 more words long, don't use 500,000 words to tell it!"
4,One of my co-worker's is reading my copy of Assassins,"I belong to a small congregation-virtually everyone is reading the Left Behind books and loving each new volume. Recently a friend introduced me to ""Transfer-the end of the beginning"" by Jerry Furland. ""Transfer"" is not so much a ""Christian"" fiction book as it is a techno-political thriller with overt Christian themes. Like Assassins, ""Transfer"" is one vision no one can easily dismiss and I often find myself lost in thought pondering the inevitability of Furland's near future nightmare. These are heady times for faith-based people of all ages. I await each morning newspaper and evening news broadcast with profoundly heightened interest and understanding. Until volume seven comes along, you might want to read ""Transfer""..."
5,This sixth in a Series Book makes God the destination for Me,"This book has made me Comfortable to have a conversation about God.I have always thought of myself as a believer in God and Jesus Christ, but my realtionship with God was always personal and private. The series ""Left Behind"" to this last book ""Assasins"" has made the discussion of my belief system and that ""Private"" relationship, something I freely discuss with any who will talk with me about God.This is a griping story and very entertaining and I am ready for the final chapter. Read it and think. It will make you think about your life.Take a breath first."
4,It was good to get back into this series.,"I had looked forward to this book for the past several months. I didn't think it was quite as captivating as the first five books, but wasn't overly disappointed. I continue to look forward the each new release."
5,An absolute must read!,"Though the basic plot was written long ago, these authors managed to interject much creativity by developing life-like senerios. The characters are very well developed and interesting to learn about. The ending presents an exciting cliff-hanger that leaves the reader with a yearning to start on book #7 -- the tribulation undercover.Trish"
1,I've been Left Behind,"Left Behind was good enough to get me hooked on reading the next four but Assassins is the last one for me. This has become like the day time soaps where there is little content between the cliff hanging end of one book and the next. There really isn't even a coherent story anymore.Assassins was full of disgusting violence inappropriate for a Christian book series. This is the kind of mind-garbage I try to avoid. The Left Behind series has gone down the sewer of glamorized violence. The original premise of Left Behind, to explore the post-Rapture days based on scripture in Revelation, has worn so thin that there is nothing recognizable anymore. From now on, just leave me behind."
2,When Will It End?,"This book is another unsatisfying installment in a truly awesome story. The first book was wonderful, but they have gotten progressively more disappointing. How long can the authors drag this story out! It begins to look suspiciously like a marketing technique to wrest more money from readers. The writing is inconsistent in most of the books (though better in this one than several of the others), and I get tired of plowing through huge amounts of ""she said this, he did that, they went there"". One of the basics in writing is ""SHOW me, don't TELL me,"" and two such experienced authors should have mastered this by now.Instead of leaving me eager to read the next installment, the last few books have left me slightly disgusted that Christian people would stoop to selling their story out for a sensationalist money-making scheme. The whole story could easily have been told in a trilogy. I guess big business wins out again."
1,Don't buy this book!,"Even though I've done grad work towards a PhD I couldn't understand what this book was about. It's as boring as anything could be. It's all constant conversation between characters that are undeveloped and the religious nature, seems like someone's trying to convert rather than entertain. Avoid if you can."
2,Skip It,"Maybe the ""Left Behind"" series isn't for me. Maybe I shouldn't have started reading it in the middle, instead of from Book No. 1. Either way, this book was a snore until the last 40 pages or so. Even then, the ending was a huge disappointment. Note to the authors: why in the world would I want to spend my limited time reading 400 pages of your religious nonsense just to reach a cliffhanger that requires me to wait another two years to find out ""who dunnit?"""
5,This was one action-packed book that leaves you hanging!,"I read this in less than 24 hrs! The end really leaves you wondering who got Saint Nick. I think this was even more exciting than Apollyon. When you read this series, it makes you realize the importance of witnessing. I can't wait until the next book!"
3,Both the content and the storyline were mediocre.,"Past references to previous books were too numerous and lengthy. I don't think it is necessary to complete rehash the past books to this extent. Frankly, the first 1/3 of the book was rather boring, compared to the others. I am a huge proponent of the Left Behind series, but it seems like the authors are trying to stretch out their writings to fulfill their committment made to their publisher for a certain number of books. One would think there is ample material in Revelations on which to base many more books without having to include lengthy past sections and/or drift away from a strong storyline."
5,Beautiful description of grief,"In this book on grief, both the words and the art give a beautiful description of the process of grief. This book is especially profound in the way it normalizes loss - because the experience is so different for everyone, and because loss is something most everyone will deal with. It has meaning for the very young as well as the very old."
5,Tear Soup,I have purchased more than one of these books to share with family and friends who have suffered a loss. My sister and her children who buried her 39 year old husband/father found great comfort in it. My friend's 16 year old daughter who buried her best friend also found it to be a comfort. My friend who is battling liver cancer bought her own copy. I recommend it for all ages and many stages of grief.
5,Best Book Ever on grieving,I received this book after I lost my husband. Now I give it to anyone close to me that has had a significant loss in their life. The illustration is very well done for any age person. It really helps to understand that not everyone grieves the same way and it gives a good understanding of what to expect from others as you go through the grieving process.Highly recommended.
3,Storybook for adults,Even adults need storybooks. This one was sweet and illustrates a few of the ways that people diplay their grief.
5,One of the all time great books on grief,"I fell in love with this book the moment I opened the cover. Though often listed as a book for children, this book is for everyone regardless of age. The story and illustrations are pure poetry, and accurately communicate the experience of grief.Tear Soup is comforting, educational, and a complete joy to read. I highly recommend it.Susan L. FullerAuthor ofHow to Survive Your Grief When Someone You Love Has Died"
5,BEST BOOK EVER FOR SOMEONE DEALING WITH GRIEF,"This is an AMAZING book! I have never heard anyone explain things better. There has never been a better book of affirmation for someone dealing with grief. This book lets the griever know that he/she is okay (perfectly normal) with whatever feeling they're having and that there is NOTHING wrong with it. It's an affirmation that not everyone is going to understand your grief but there are those that do and that those people are out there. Again, I would recommend this book over all the books in the world dealing with grief."
5,Tear Soup,Very Good book for us in our time of grief at losing our 5 year old granddaughter to a drunken driver. It brought some comfort and peace.We are happy with how quickly it arrived and with the condition of the book
3,entertaining pop-culture satire,"Racial stereotypes and the accoutrements of hip-hop culture come in for some gentle ribbing in ""Janky Promoters,"" a fairly innocuous though still relatively entertaining comedy written by and starring Ice Cube.It's a tale of two second-rate music promoters (Ice Cube and Mike Epps) trying to stage a rap concert in Modesto, California, and the many personal and financial hurdles they have to jump over to pull it off. It's not a slashing satire by any stretch of the imagination, but a game cast (including an entertaining Young Jeezy who brings a great deal of charm to his portrayal of himself) and a few genuinely funny moments make up for its overall blandness."
5,Everything in hard rock started here,"If you are a real Rock fan, no matter your age, or school (Pink Floyd or Dream Theather fan), this dvd will show one of the most impresive hard rock concerts in the modern music history.It is impresive too, the HD resolution and sharp image in the Blue Ray format, even though this is a movie from 1973.Believe me , this will show you that "" Everything in hard rock started here """
1,Embarrassing,I'm embarrassed that I enjoyed this when it was first released. This is painful to watch. The sight of Robert Plant twirling his finger up by his head is indelibly etched in my brain and has turned me from a Zep fanatic to Zep detractor. Only redeeming quality of the video is Bonham's playing
2,Watch the ERRORS,"Go to [the website] and see what a crime Jimmy Page commited. I was there on the last ""Night of the Last Tour"" and i watched a Hindu toss batons afire up into an Olympic sized bowl of flame above Bonzo's drums in the 2nd solo Wole Lotta Love but nothing made it into the DVD. Ask Jimmy where the lost footage is, 25,000 people besides me saw it on July 29, 1973.You can see bonzos gong on fire then watch Jimmy take his giuitar off for the 2nd time at the end of WWLove. A tribute to the Twin Towers before Stairway. NYC skyline as it existed in 1973. BUY THIS, its worth the price to criticize."
4,The Song isnt the Same,"After owning the original Song Remains the same CD, VHS tape, and DVD, I can say the couple added tracks are worth losing pieces of a few others. Sound quality is very good. This is one instance where Dolby Digital outshines its DTS counterpart. Video is okay, after all it was shot in the 70's, and the audio as I mentioned above is very good. Not mind shattering like some of the other recordings I own, but nice.A great addition for the Zep-maniacs' collections!"
2,"Unfortunately, the only official Zeppelin video performance","Anyone who owns any ""underground"" Zeppelin performances (or, for that matter, BBC Sessions) knows that this is NOT Led Zeppelin at their best. In fact, the 73 tour may well have been their worst. If you're a fan, of course you have to own this, but if you're a REAL DIE-HARD FANATIC, then send some blank tapes to someone in a newsgroup and get yourself a copy of a performance from the early days or the L.A. shows of '77. Then you'll REALLY hear what Led Zeppelin was all about... and you'll realize that 'The Song Remains The Same' was an unfortunate mistake."
5,Smokin' addition to my VHS copy,"It's the VHS version and then some. Better picture, better sound and the extras are cool. What's not to like? Niiiice!"
3,For the USA only??????????????????????????????,"Yes guys, this was not released in the Uk? IT was of it's time and was great to watch and have as a lesson in what could be done by a great group.Thank you for the memories,but who's idea was it not to release it in the Uk or Europe? Probably the same people who let people without Uk postcodes get tickets for the reunion gig at the O2, after saying you could only apply if you had a Uk postcode?You can probably tell that I am a little bit cross about Money talking! but hey has'nt it always been that way."
1,It did not work!,"The dvd did not play in any of our devices (dvd players [non blue ray] and laptops). It kept coming up with the error message that read ""cannot read disc"". Had to return it and hope to get my money back."
3,Good for Zep fanatics. Loses its charm for others.,"You know already whether you'll like this DVD -- if you're listening to Led Zeppelin right now, then by all means buy this DVD.Those less enamored with the band may find that there's a lot of self-indulgent crap here, and the band seems to be mailing it in on many of the songs. Of course it is the drugs, and fatigue of being on the road, but the listless performances suggest they didn't really care all that much."
1,The Song Is Only the Same if You Can Get It!,"I have been waiting at this writing for almost THREE MONTHS to receive this set, ordered on December 1! How can it be in such short supply? Amazon should be embarassed."
2,Strictly 80's,"I ordered two copies of this video, one for myself and one for a gift. After viewing my copy, I promptly asked Amazon if I could return both of them. Unlike the great 30-minute workouts Gilad has on television, this video was made back in the 80's and is a string of workouts lasting 70 minutes long. There is no use of free weights, and the exercises are all dated -- lots of old aerobic steps. I am going to replace these with up-to-date Gilad workout videos. Don't bother with this one, even for the price."
3,Epic saga of the catle drive,"The first in a series of trail drive books, Mr. Compton creates a vivid picture of those days following the civil war. This is a real ""cowboys and Indians"" book. Experience what it was like to drive cattle hundreds of miles so they could be sold."
2,Trout Fishing in America,"Although the book is the exact book I wished, it seems like it was in a box or storage for quite a long time as the pages are quite yellowed. The book seems to have been published in 1969. Also, the edges of the pages are stained.I will thoroughly enjoy reading this book again but I wish it was in better condition."
2,not that great,"I have really enjoyed the trojan box sets, both for quality of music, and the value. But this one I realy didn't care for that much. Most of the tracks are really poppy and sappy. Mostly there are love songs and doo-woop sounding reggae, sounds like reggae produced for mass appeal. Not a very rewarding listening experience I think."
4,Trixie has many fans,"I was given my first Trixie Belden Book when I was about 12 and loved it. Ended up reading the entire series. I am amazed as to how many fans she still has. I have a pet chinchilla, who I named Trixie...just by random. I have had many people ask me if she was named for Trixie Belden. Now I just say ""Yes she was""."
5,trixie belden,"ty, i used to read her books when i was young, i loved them.new book, great conditiontysmLauri"
5,A wonderful role model for young girls,"I still remember the day I first picked up a Trixie Belden book (it was 23 years ago and I was almost 9) and I have been hooked ever since. Trixie is so easy to relate to - she isn't perfect, she loses her temper, she has to deal with three brothers, and she has lots of chores - but she has a heart of gold, a wonderful generous spirit, and a determinedness that is inspirational. This series contains not only wonderful adventures appealing to kids, but teaches the true meaning of friendship and generosity. And the author even manages to work in educational facts and vocabulary skills in a completely painless way! I recommend this series for every child between the ages of 8 and 14!"
3,disappointed,"""This used book was supposed to be in good condition with no easily noticeable wear. I was disappointed; the cover stained and worn. This book was definitely well used."""
5,Start with this book for a thrilling mystery series,"Trixie and Honey meet, they meet Jim, they lose Jim. It all begins here! Rereading the series 25+ years later, I was pleasantly surprised to find that every chapter doesn't end in an exclamation point and that the relationships among the friends and families are still so rewarding. Worth reading-or rereading! (Visit the Trixie Belden Library website for discussions of the various series editions, illustrators, and authors.)The different illustrations slant the series greatly. I usually prefer the illustrations in the Deluxe (or Tall) editions, as Trixie and Honey look more like modern-day 13-year-olds than they do in the earlier, Glossy editions, where they look very young and outdated. Still, I like any illustrated edition better than the later text-only editions of the 70s and 80s, but read whatever you can get your hands on!"
5,I'm a lifer,"This product is AMAZING is you have sensitive or acne prone skin. I've been using this product for 6 yrs and my skin is in better condition while wearing this makeup, then it is when I go a week wearing none at all. It stays where I put it and blends easily."
4,Good textbook,"I use this book as a textbook for an undergraduate course on Multimedia Application Development (together with Guzdial's book on Squeak).It's a good book if you want to know about the way multimedia content is encoded and transmitted. It's not very deep but, as I mentioned, I use it for an undergraduate course..."
3,More than one publication,The book is wonderful but this particular printing was missing the epiloge. I wanted this especially and wished that I had known there were two versions of the book.
2,Boring...,"This book seemed to be written over a weekend to catch the 'Founding Fathers' craze. It was poorly written, very large print (I assume to stretch the page count), and it seemed to be a rehash of other's work. I wouldn't buy it. 'Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation' is a much better read."
3,The Evolution Of Majin Buu!,"This vhs contains 3 episodes:Episode 239: The Evil Of Men: As a crazy dude spoils Majin Buu`s mood, Hercule saves the day by knocking the two out. But when Hercule falls victim to the duo's dangerous attacks, Majin Buu heals him, but evolves into a new dangerous form!Episode 240: Buu Against Buu: As Majin Buu rejects the evil inside his body, two monsterous beasts now are in excistence: Good and Evil. But when Evil Buu proves his powers and turns Majin Buu into chocolate and eats him the evil monster evolves into a more dangerous and destructive form: SUPER BUU!!!Episode 241: Empty Planet: As Super Buu uses his new powers to sense energy levels he arrives at the Lookout! But his goal is too clash against Gotenks! But knowing that the fusion warrior is not ready to clash in battle, Piccolo presuades the evil beast to amuse himself elsewire! But when Super Buu wipes out the remaining inhabits of Earth, Piccolo may have no choice but to show him Gotenks!"
5,The King of 12-String,"Another highlight recorded by the ""King of the 12-String""with his friends. A ""must"" for every Byrds/McGuinn aficionado.You'll miss something if you don't have this CD."
1,Music To Put You To Sleep,"With the exception of Judy Collins' lovely guest vocals, this is a wake-up call for The Byrds to reunite. Extremely disappointed in the boring arrangements and lackluster performance from Roger McGuinn!!"
4,For beginners!,"For a biginner, many famous textbooks(Fridberg's or Leon's or etc.)are too diffcult and focus on high density of theory rather than caculation problems. Examples of this book help me a lot to know Linear Algebra. We could use this as our first text book of Linear Algebra. After we are familiar with Linear Algebra, we could get another textbook."
1,Extremely Borrrrrrriiiiiinnnnnnngggggg,"This Air Supply should've been cut off a very long time ago. Whenever any of their songs comes on the radio I immediately shut it off. Bad ear candy is all they ever recorded. Mindless, sappy garbage. Even Bread's music was more interesting than this!"
5,Anything but boring!,"Any person with appreciation for musical talent knows that Air Supply is one of the best bands ever. Graham Russell is one of the finest writers ever and a very talent all-around musician. Russell Hitchcock has one of the strongest, most powerful voices I've ever heard. And it all shows on this fine album. Besides the radio songs, Having you near me, Old habits die hard, and American hearts are all very much worth hearing."
2,The quality of this version of the book was awful.,"My problem is with the quality, not the contents. Through the first chapter, I actually quite liked the author's delivery of the material.I've looked at a version at a library, and at my local textbook store, and those versions were definitely quality made. However, when I found the same book on Amazon for about $40 to $50 less, I thought it would be a great buy. On the contrary, this version was made much more cheaply (hence the lower cost, I'm sure). The material for the pages isn't as nice, and the binding was so bad, that within the first week it had completely ripped of in front, merely from opening it.The book is great, if you get the quality version. I guess you get what you pay for, but still at $60, I would expect something a little better."
2,NOT A GOOD CHOICE FOR THE BUKKAKE LOVER,"The title says it all. If you are one of the chosen few, you are better off buying a different logic book."
4,Enlightening view of the Princess,"I thought this book was pretty balanced in it's approach to Diana. It told about her faults as well as her glory. I have a better understanding of her as a person, not just a royal, having read the book. The writing was hard to follow in places where it would jump ahead or behind the current timeframe it was discussing to bring up a relevant point. Some of the name dropping and family connections were a bit confusing for someone who isn't familiar with everyone involved in the story."
1,Don't waste your time with PD release,"The only good thing about this is the biographical audio. PD productions has insulted the viewer with almost unviewable video transfer film. I have not seen the Synergy release but I can not understand why this has been rated over a 1 star if that. Far better would be to get or view ""Marilyn Monroe: The Mortal Goddess"" with similar footage but released by Image and very good quality,and alo an excerpted version available called Marily Monroe: The Final Days""- you will be satisfied."
4,Cool overview,"This book is very cool and good ilustrated overall look at 3D computer graphics. I found usefull to step out of one 3d package and take a wide overall look at this amazing animation craft (I myself use 3ds max). Book is systematically organized and ilustrated good, there are many ""behind the scenes"", production type pictures. Why not 5 stars? This is subjective - there was sometimes strange confusion about author's selection of movies to take pictures from to show 3d graphics evolution4 stars - I like it! Time from time look for references, review terminalogy. Worth buyingWhat not expect from book - application specific tutorials, book originaly isn't intendet to cover this stuff"
4,"Avante Garde from Richmond,Va","Based in Richmond,Va this Avante Garde ensemble has a rotatting roster of musicians. The core of the group is Saxaphonist/bassist Tim Harding and guitarist Ron Curry. Together since the early 90's they have produced seveal albums for Gregg Ginns SST Label. This release features Ginn and Ornette Colemans former Prime Time guitarist Bern Nix on guitars. It is a thrilling adventure in free Jazzz and Afro-Beat rhythms."
2,That's true!,"The pages are interesting glimpses of possibilities on ""the other side"". This is a book of artwork presenting different points of view of an illustration. The book starts with drawings of how to make a paper airplane. The next illustration is a little girl practicing a cello and seeing a paper airplane fly past her window. Turn the page to see the air outside of the apartment building filled with paper airplanes which a little boy has thrown out of the window. I really enjoyed looking at that idea of ""the other side"". It got strange from there as disconnected scenarios trying to be connected are presented. I couldn't quite figure it all out from front to back; back to front; and middle to outside even with the help of friends. I concluded that it was just different illustrations. I found myself ""on the other side"" and I didn't get it."
1,So many better choices!,"This game is easy to learn, and will get your toddler started with board games. But be warned, it's fantastically boring for adults to play. Be prepared to sit around rolling the die turn after turn waiting for it to land on the one thing you need to finish the game. Just about any game by Haba would be a better choice."
1,Don't buy this horrible thing,"I just bought two of them, because they were supposed to be hi-temperature resistant (450f). Used one to turn over a couple of fried eggs. Guess what, the edge of the turner melted. Now I'm stuck with two of these, not even worth bothering to return for a refund. I am very unhappy with this product."
3,Not intense enough for this reviewer,"Found this to be more of an overall toning video vs. hips,abs and arms. I'm a regular runner who was looking for a fairly intense toning regimen. Although easy to follow, I'm not getting the kind of intensity I was hoping for. Better for the beginner exerciser."
5,Three cheers for this book!,I have the pleasure of working with Kathy McDonald on a committee for the National Association of Women Businessowners - so it does not surprise me that she has crafted a truly insightful book for women who need help balancing their professional and personal lives. I have witnessed how skillfully Kathy balances hers - while still giving back to the women's business community through her volunteer efforts.
5,Breakin' All the Rules,"Jamie Foxx is a riot in this funny movie. A movie you can watch over and over! With Morris Chesnut, they complement each other!"
3,all rules broke.,"Interesting movie with an all start cast of African Americans actors and the delicious Gabrielle Union......oh wee, let's say her smile is the main reason I had to buy this product. Jamie Fox and Morris Chestnut deliver excellent performances.The story in a way is funny and true. Poor white boss is being used by his chick."
2,Life at it's lowest,"Due to two excellent reviews, I looked forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, I found it very difficult to read, from the alcoholism of the major characters who seemed to be extremely gullible, to the cruelty of the townspeople. While well written, I just couldn't find any redeeming quality to the story."
3,Great history but a little long,The history is amazing but I found the story went a little long. The story is a little dark but I myself like dark tales. All in all a good read.
1,Dickens of London,"This one made me antsy.... I just couldn't stand the lead actor...just ""too much"" --- his mannerisms drove me nuts.I never finished watching it and donated it to Friends ofthe Library sale.....wasted my money.+"
2,"Ridge Racer DS is just okay, not great","Well, I bought this game on sale at a GameStop and it came out to be a bit of a dissapointment. It just doesn't hold much water as a racing title. The handling is very loosey-goosey, which is fine in a way because it's an arcade racer, but this goes too far. Mario Kart DS is a much better choice and there really isn't a good racer besides that out for the system right now. Like Guilty Gear in fighting for the DS (at the time of this review), Mario Kart is a much better choice though of course the whole feel and montage of the two games are a bit different. But Ridge Racer DS feels a bit watered-down and not quite worth the money, especially if someone payed full price for the title. Undoubtedly fun and tempting to buy because of the Ridge Racer brand, but other than that this is probably one to avoid in favor of Mario Kart or just another title or investment altogether."
2,Missing an important component,"The actuator can be used on your vehicle somewhat successfully. This updated version as they call it does not have one of the factory installed connections on it. This missing component's function is to disarm the alarm on the vehicle when you unlock that door with your key. If a remote is used, or the other side is unlocked with your key, this isn't a problem. However, the new actuator from GM is also missing this component. Your only option to fix it correctly is to buy the entire door lock mechanism from GM, which is $250 at my local dealer. I will stick with this product because of the price difference."
1,No extended Cut,"They're clearly waiting for the inevitable 16-DVD BluRay Box set to release the extended cuts of the films and Deathly Hallows in HD on iTunes.Save your money, once I got my 3&4 and found I'd been fooled into buying them, I brought all four of my ""Ultimate Editions"" to a used store.I already have these movies on DVD and don't need to spent 40 bucks to see ""making of"" features and get a picture book."
1,Where is the magic of the book? The acting was good though...,"Very dissapointed. Good acting, but the screenplay is just awful. Did the person who wrote it read the book? I hope they won't let him to mutilate the next one."
5,great!,Seller got the movie to us at a great price and super fast! Movie is in great working order and we really enjoyed it!
2,They Blew It,"These movies have never been good, especially with the books held in comparison. Their popularity has resulted only from the books. Improvements are made in each new movie, but this one was a disappointment even with my lowered standards. I think it was mostly the emotional scenes. Corny enough to make you cringe. They took the ending of this book, which the entire book leads up to and which is hugely critical to the story, and they compressed it into a few minutes. I felt the need to apologize to those who saw it who I knew hadn't read the book and justify why I like the book in the first place."
2,Wost of the series,Story line is kind of all over the place. I don't care for the actress that plays Umbridge. The leave out critical stuff in the book then include stuff that just doesn't matter.
1,I am afraid to watch the last two brought to film after this one,"First off i adore the books. I've watched all the harry potter films because as bad as they are, i want to see what they did to it and i wasnt disappointed. This movie has so much fodder people were tripping over it in the theater aisles. Knowing that this was the longest book in the series some things were bound to be omitted. But the screenwriters keep making the same mistake. They cut out parts of the book that lead one to the other. This movie was extremely short but it doesnt feel like it. I kept looking at my watch and being surpriseed 2 hours hadnt passed. I'm a diehard of the books so i'm not going to be pleased completely but that doesnt mean i can't find it watchable. I enjoyed the 3rd movie immensely but it just gets worse when the books get darker and darker. Heres hoping they dont ruin the final 2 movies."
3,Bored in Birmingham,"After reading several other reviews of Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix, I was pleased to learn that I was not the only disappointed fan. As an avid HP fan, it was torture to sit through this movie and not complain. Even my 8 year old son, who loves all things Harry Potter looked at my husband and I after 45 minutes and said ""Is it supposed to be this boring?"". The problems with the film are numerous, however, the lack of MAGIC in the first half of the movie ruined the entire experience for me. I have no problem overlooking the incongruities between the book and the movie, but this movie stepped too far outside the lines of the text. I have one other problem with this movies...I have to buy it because I refuse to have an incomplete DVD collection. Here's hoping Amazon sells it at a really great price!"
1,What?,"I was really dissapointed when I saw this movie. I felt that there was too much cut out from the book, and many of the scenes felt rushed or unfinished.I was very upset when I learned that Nevil and Kreacher were denied their fairly major rolls that they had in the book, which contribute to future books and plot points.If you have not read the book, and know nothing about the book, you may have a hard time following the movie. It really cannot stand on its own at all. Action wise, it's pretty good, and some scenes were very well done, but over all I found it to be lacking. I've never felt like walking out of a movie until I saw this one. I'm not even going to bother seeing the 6th movie when it comes out. It will be even worse because of things that were cut out of this one.If you've read the book, save your money and don't get the movie. You'll just want to cry because of what was lost and the pointless scenes that were added."
1,The worst harry potter movie,This was by far the worst harry potter movie. It felt mediocre and really dumb and I hope people get this.
1,some weird accents,"What I find most annoying about the Potter movies is the weird accents of some of the actors. I especially find Emma Watson's English bizarre. She doesn't really speak words; she makes chippy sounds and you are supposed to divine the word connected to the sound. I find as a result only about 15% of what she says intelligible. On the other hand Maggie Smith is completely clear as is Michael Gambon and many of the others. Radcliffe is quite okay, I'd say 85-90% of what he says is clear. Watson is the worst. For her one needs subtitles to know precisely what she is saying."
4,Extended cut with deleted scenes.,"I too would like to have the DVD with the extended cut and the deleted scenes included. They show it on TV when they are doing the HP marathon. I don't see why they don't come out with that on Blu Ray, or DVD. I would gladly buy that along with everything else. I thought I saw an advertisement for the movies that had included everything. My ears perk up whenever they talk about the movie with deleted scenes. They should make that an option on all the DVDs anyway. If there is such a thing PLEASE let me know. I guess I'll just have to wait another year or so before they come out with that."
1,Very disappointed.,"For the real HP fans, that was the whole purpose of getting the ultimate editions; to see the the movies in their ultimate and complete form. It simply indicates a lack of understand on the part of WB regarding their real audience. Collector cards and fancy boxes might be great for the kids, but most of us bought the ultimate edition for the full movie. One more thought from a fan. Up until HP and the Deathly Hallows P1, the earlier movies have remained pretty true (if not complete) to their books. Not so with HP and the Deathly Hallows P1. (Harry not disguised at the wedding; Harry and Herminoe not not under the clock when they entered Godrick's Hallow, the real reason the Lovegood's home was destroyed, etc.) Although a good movie, I hope they do a better job with part 2."
1,USPS and Amazon - a deadly combination of incompetence,The movie is fine. Service was poor. First the post office decided it could not deliver the package...the address was not correct (???). I then canceled the order. But Amazon sent a movie anyway. ***Sigh***
4,Morgon Lafae,"I loved Order of the Phoenix! Just a 411 for all you Harry Potter fans I read a book this summer by a new writer Ana Rose. She wrote a book called Alfheim The Horn of Night Starr. It is a very good book I think she could be America's J.k Rollings with her Alfheim series. I read the book and it sucked me in from the begining, I couldn't put it down until I finished the final page! I would say her story is like Erogon meets Narina with a LOTR flavor to it. I really hope you check out this book it is one of the best reads I haad all summer! I can't wait for book 2. You should look her up and give her book a read! I truely think that she can fill the Harry Potter space being the series has just finished."
2,By far the WORST Harry Potter movie,"The movie was incredibly cut-up and lacked plot/character development. The graphics were superb, but at great cost to the film. I was incredibly disappointed at the aweful portrayal of the fifth book and will not likely watch it more than one more time. Had I not read the book, I would have not understood a single thing that was going on because the movie was just all over the place. The significance of most of the characters was not exemplified and the only thing anyone could have gotten out of it was Voldemort was evil and tricked Harry into getting a glowing sphere. There were many things missing in which the movie could benefitted more by following the book. The only part which I thought was extremely captivating was when all of Dumbledore's Army was punished with the special quill. The look on the Weasly twin's face (I think it was Fred) really captured the moment of agony and disgust."
1,Rated solely on DVD quality ....,This is a sinister ploy used by WB to push consumers to buy either Blu or HD DVD. The DVD encoding for this movie is terrible during the opening of the movie and ending of the movie.DVD's never looked this bad!
2,A disappointment,"Easily the worst film in the series to date. The story is disjointed, likely the result of attempting to cram the longest Potter book into the shortest film so far. The effects aren't very good and are a considerable step down from Goblet.As for the DVD itself, generally you will see a smattering of special features on a primary disc with additional details added to a second disc. Not the case here. There is absolutely nothing on the primary disc but the film itself. This would be acceptable if the technical quality of the film was outstanding. It's not. Far from it. Watching on a 58 in. 1080i plasma with an upconvert player, there are significant pixelation issues, easily the worst I've seen on any film.Overall, a severe disappointment. Not looking forward at all to what Yates (Director) does with Half-Blood Prince."
1,Completely different from book.,"Not only was the acting poor in most of the scenes, but half of the scenes were either completely inaccurate. They changed the sequence of events, they changed who was responsible for things, and they left about half of the book out of the movie. Things that should have taken a half hour to explain were done in 30 seconds, playing moving and giving a sideshow of what had happened. I would have walked out halfway through this movie if i had driven there. If you at all enjoyed the book, don't see this movie, it will ruin your perception of the book"
1,"Faithful to the Book, Unfortunately","When I read the book I said ""Well, it was fun while it lasted."" With ""The Order of the Phoenix"" you can point exactly to where the fun stopped and the franchise died. 800 pages of Harry scowling and barking at everyone was no day at the beach and, unfortunately, the movie is true to its literary source. And no, I will not purchase this movie nor any others that follow; as far as I'm concerned the series ended with The Goblet of Fire. It's a shame J. K. Rowling couldn't have just continued to have as much fun with the last three books as she did with the first four; you can have drama without making the narrative so unrelentingly dark and dreary."
3,Not the best,"This was not the best Harry Potter movie made and I found myself rather disappointed. I was mainly unsatisfied with the cinematography, it seemed really choppy and it chaged quickly. As the only person to have read the books, I had to expalin what was happening because my friends were lost when they were watching the film.Hopely the next two are better. The 6th Harry Potter movie comes out later in 2008 and the 7th movie has two parts, if I read corectly, that will be released in 2010; and if there are going to be two parts, it had better be epic!"
5,Great purchase!,The item was quality and worked perfectly. It arrived in a reasonable amount of time. I am thoroughly satisfied.
4,Did someone let the air out?,"Although I was assured by my students that, if I liked the previous Harry Potter movies, I would love this one I found it a bit disappointing by comparison to the prior four movies. I can't quite put my finger on where the ""magic"" is lacking but the movie, overall, seems a bit flat. Maybe it'll grow on me with time?"
1,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix DVD,This DVD was defective and did not play properly even though there was no visible damage to or scratching on the disc.
3,Could Have Been Better,"I went and saw the midnight release of this movie and when it was over, I was disappointed. The book is the longest in the series but it was reduced to the shortest movie. The problem I felt with this movie it is seemed to have a too many changes. For example when Harry's Uncle is speaking to him in the fire it's different. I preferred the special effects for that scene in Goblet of Fire. Not only that the Dementors looked silly in this film, they looked much better in the Prisoner of Azkaban. The other problem I had was the fight between Dumbledore and Voldemort seemed rather cheesy and over too fast.I did however feel this movie was way better then Spider-man 3 and still say that Goblet of Fire is my favorite so far in the series."
1,"Don't waste your time, read the book.","If you take a masterpiece and cut off most of the story, Order of the Phoenix is what you have. The book is great and they include most of everything, but it just does not hold up to the book as far as the story goes. My advise is to read the book first and if you still want to waste your time go ahead."
1,terrible movie,"i tried to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. there were too many scenes that where cut, as usual too many added on scenes that were never in the book, the elf kreacher didn't have the snout nose he was supposed to have, etc. lines that were supposed to be said at a certain time were either said to early or in front of a large group of people. cho wasn't the one who betrayed dumbledore's army, her friend was. veritaserum was only attempted to be used on harry, not everyone in the school. dumbledore never faltered before the ministry or dolores umbridge, yet he does in the movie. i read on J.K. Rowling's website that some of the things they had done in the movies had surprised her, and i think she was being nice. a lot of what was done in the movies was an insult to the books. i hope these movies are remade in the future the right way by directors and screenwriters who know what they are doing."
2,"Books getting better, movies getting worse","Ok, first of all, I have read all the books but do not consider them literary classics. Rowling leaves a lot to the imagination, and when you write a screenplay adapation it gives you much more freedom to cherry-pick the best ideas of the novel. Alfonso Cuaron did a MARVELOUS job of this in Prisoner of Azkaban, which I feel is the best-made HP movie by a WIDE margin in terms of direction, cinematography, and being as true to the novel as possible. This movie, as others have so graciously pointed out, is extremely flawed in so many ways I pray that books 6 and 7 will have more competent screenwriters and they should pay Cuaron whatever it takes to direct the last book. That being said, the performances are the best since all the returning actors have perfected their roles to a T and Imelda should get an Academy Award nomination for her bit as Umbridge. I hope the final two get better treatment than this one did."
4,My review,"If you like Harry Potter movies, then this one is as good as the others. I bought it to add to my collection that includes all the previous movies, and was not disappointed. It continues the same characters and themes as previous movies and adds some new elements and characters as well."
5,movie buff,"Another fantastic adaptation of the book to the silver screen, if your a harry potter fan you will enjoy this movie, and even if your not you still will enjoy this movie."
3,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Review,This product came on time. however the hd dvd side has some scuffs on the cd and in certin spots it would not play.
2,"Such a great book, such a thin movie...","After reading the book, I expected a rich and demensional film but alas, it was watery and thin..So much was cut from the book that I hardly recgonized the movie..Don't get me wrong, I am and will always be a die hard fan, but after seeing the other movies, and seeing how wonderful all the actors are, I was so looking forward to seeing each character develop like they did in the book...So much untapped talent..I cannot say don't bother because the movie did hold some magic, but it was somewhat disappointing to say the least..I am hoping that the future movies in the series do not chop and cut like this one did.UPDATE 2/2/08.. I decided to give the DVD one more chance and so I attempted to watch tonight but alas, 10 minutes into the movie, my DVD froze and would not play....crap, in all ways. Save your money folks and but the book only"
3,"The movie, 3.5. The Amazon service quality, 3.","The movie deserves a 3.5 star rating. However, I need subtitles, which is not supported by most of Amazon movies. The resolution should be higher."
1,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,It's too bad there is not a rating lower than One Star for this Movie. If you want to watch a bunch of Movie trailers then buy this Movie. I am truly ticked off. I have seen the long drawn out reviews above and I can say it and review this without being long winded or nice. Its a bunch of movie trailers all latticed together as a movie. It truly stinks as a movie. The Book was the best in all 7 books. Horrid. If you really want it buy it for a penny on Amazon and 2.98 shipping and don't waste any more money than that on it. That and unless you buy the crappy Ultimate edition you will get some of this movie cut out on the cheaper versions like it isn't horrid enough or short enough already.
3,Story cut down dramatically,"Unfortunately Steve Kloves who wrote all the other Harry Potter screenplays did NOT write ""Order of the Phoenix"". The story from the book was cut so drastically that unless you read the book, much of the story would have not been easily followed. The Director wasn't good either. I hope they get the original directors and/or screenwriter for the next two books when they film them. The book was pretty much cut to ribbons in this film."
4,harry potter,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)Easily followed storyline...sometimes a bit offtrack with plot,but generally quickly resolved.Characters still have their original attractiveness.Their maturity has evolved nicely into more stregthening of personal characteristics."
3,Short,"Order of the Phoenix was a huge book, but the movie is fairly short. I wanted to love this movie, but I only like it. The book is far superior in every way possible. It does the job, but not well."
4,Great addiiton for my colllection,Purchased Harry Potter over the holiday because i couldn't pass up the price. It is an excellent movie to enjoy on blue ray. i am extremely please with my purchase and would recommend it highly for anyone who is adding to their blue ray collection.
3,worst of the 5 movies,"I'm an AVID Potter fan. Taking the longest book and making it the shortest movie was a poor idea. Potter fans would gladly sit through a 3-hour movie if it meant more of the book was in there. Instead, we get a bunch of sequences which make very little sense to someone who hasn't read the Potter books. It looks very choppy, with scenes simply slammed together. The acting was underplayed, and terribly so- it was tough to find any real emotion, even when Snape catches Harry peaking in his pensieve! So it was difficult to feel emotionally involved with the whole thing. It felt stiff, stodgy, and disjointed. Sure, I'll still buy it, but someone else should have put this one together. Compared to the other 4 movies, this one looks amateur-ish."
2,"Good Movie, Horrible DVD","The movie is great. The widescreen DVD however is horrible. The video is grainy, and at least the disc we got has horrible compression artifacts as well as an aspect ratio change from chapter 16 to chapter 17.I guess the studio is trying to push us to switch to HD DVD or BluRay.Overall, the widescreen edition is a waste of money."
4,Starts Getting Darker,"This is where the Harry Potter series starts getting darker. Voldemort's followers are after Harry and his friends, but the Order of the Phoenix is sworn to protect him! I think the movies (and books) are appropriate for children that are the ages of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. I would let my 11-year-old read ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" (book 1), but I wouldn't let him or her read ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" (book 5) until he or she was closer to age 16.For myself, I enjoyed the books and the movies immensely!"
2,Excited but disappointed.,I am a new Kindle user and was excited that this Marryat book was avaialble. I was looking forward to being able to practice my navigation with an entertaining yarn. But the formatting was somehow flawed. It warps before the end of every line. Tiresome. I hope as I get more experience I will be able to fix it. For now I am just disappointed.
2,"Loved content, hard to read","If you can make your way around by your self, it is great--but the table of contents is difficult and it is hard to flip through and find your well remembered poems. Probably should have bought an annotated version. Will probably buy a paper used version instead."
3,Good replacement but...,This is a replacement watch band for the original but was made for smaller wrist. Could have been a few notches longer.
5,Love this movie,I purchased this DVD to replace the DVD that I lost about 8 years ago. This movie is hilarious and it arrived in great condition and quickly.
2,THIS BOOK LICKS B@llz!,"Man was I ripped off! I read the reviews and found myself somehow, really really interested in this book. I purchased it and waited for it to arrive. I finally got my hands on it, boy was I sorry. I started looking and searching for all the ""cool things"" it was supposed to have, but man, this book just sucks.Its cool if you want to check out the 70s 80s punk rock fashion and style this kids had. But nothing incredible. Its also very little so the pictures arent that great. Blows!"
2,"Does not have ""Soft touch silicone handle""","I ordered this kettle because I really liked the design, and because the description claimed it had a ""soft touch silicone handle."" When I received the kettle, there was no such handle. The handle was shiny stainless steel. I really wanted a kettle with a handle that wouldn't be too hot to pick up when the water is ready. I tried it out and it was way too hot to pick up when the water was done. Also, the whistle was weak and you have to take it out to pour the water out, which is annoying to me. I am returning it. Too bad, I can't have style and function this time."
5,Great tool after I adjusted it,"I have had this tool for a while now and didn't really use it that much. Boards I ran though it had lines and nicks in them and needed a lot of sanding to get smooth. Recently I needed to plane down a bunch of stock so decided to change the blades and try to get it adjusted right. I did not have any problems getting the blades out like some early reviews commented on so Delta must of fixed the over-tighten problem on the blade screws. I cleaned the blades and the area around them and since they still looked sharp put them back in. The machine ran perfect after that. Boards are smooth needing little finish sanding with no nicks or snipe at all. This thing creates a lot of dust and chips so I really recommend the dust collector accessory for it. Take a hour or so when you first get this machine to take the blades out and clean them and the area around them before you start using the machine, you won't regret it."
5,Must have in any pagan library,"I can't believe it took me so long to read this book! The only upside to waiting so long is I got the updated version with new information and refrences. I learned so much about pagan history in America. This book really is a must have for any pagan library. This is not a book about ""Wicca"" it is a history of the evolution of different pagan religions in America."
5,Excellent scholarship,"This book was my introduction to Paganism, and Adler does an excellent job covering Wicca in-depth, and also includes such lesser-mentioned branches of Paganism as Discordianism, the Church of All Worlds, etc. Adler explores what it's all about, as well as the history behind Neo-Paganism as a whole, and the roots of individual Pagan religions. Extremely well-researched, this book avoids the ""New Age fluff"" category into which so many Pagan books fall. This is an excellent read for any Pagan, and certainly the best introduction to Paganism I can imagine."
3,Good But Very Out-of-Date,"I read this book when it was first published in 1979. I would've given it four stars then, but now this book is hopelessly out-of-date, which most reviewers fail to point out. The ""revised"" editon of 1997 only added an updated resource guide. Well, the entire book needs updating! I hope Ms. Adler will do so in the near future. So much has happened and changed in the last 25 years of modern paganism. This is still I very good book, but do keep in mind that it is now hardly a comprehensive overview of what Paganism is about in the year 2003. 1979, yes; but now?"
5,A CLASSIC,"It took a while for me, until I finally added this book into my library. First I was afraid, that it might be a little bit outdated, but then I discovered the qualities of a timeless classic. Together with Raven Grimassis ""Wiccan Mysteries"" an intelligent and informative source of Wiccan history, written with a critical point of view. A must for Pagans and spirtual seekers."
3,"Very enjoyable, despite being very unoriginal","Picked this album up on a whim after hearing Aisle 10 on a video game soundtrack. At first listen you may think its a mix tape of obscure songs from other bands, but really its Marty James very liberal borrowing of other more established artists. In a 12 track album you get sorta SmashMouth, sorta Beck, sorta Sublime, sorta Eminem, sorta Eagle Eye Cherry, sorta Prince and others. Nice tributes or a glaring lack of originality? Could be either.But despite its lack of new material the album is very enjoyable. It's the kinda of music that works great at parties with it's good mix of styles and catchy melodies that can stick in your head. The album really grew on me and sits nicely amongst my other albums of bands in obscurity."
2,Generic music with a pop twist that offers nothing new.,"Scapegoat Wax offers nothing new to the world of music. With lyrics like: ""The rain is beatin' on your front porch / My main source of desperation is the memory torch,"" no one can take it seriously in the loosest sense. The ""muscians"" on this sound very amatuer-ish, in that there are playing simple timings that carry over to each track. Although it is nice to have a mixture of different genres of music on an album, this album does nothing but copy every other Cali rock/rap/pop group.While some lines are very catchy and you can't help but to tap your foot. This CD offers a listener nothing more than a casual listen, giving a person no real reason to purchase this album. One song by S.W. I enjoy is ""Freeway"" on Okieblow, is has a soft groove, that even the chessy lyrics overcome."
5,HEY GSC,Gunsmith Cats rule. Very good manga my first i am definetly buying the whole series plus the anime.
3,"Great content, but where's the estrogen?","Person-to-person interviews between Terry Gross and a dozen big-name authors. Some are hilarious (David Sedaris and David Rakoff) while some are thought provoking (Norman Mailer and John Updike). But where are all the women? Fran Lebowitz was asked about becoming famous for NOT writing, and how she deals with age (something Terry didn't ask James Baldwin!). Joyce Johnson spoke entirely about her relationship with Jack Kerouac, not about her own work. From a female interviewer, I expected more."
4,great item,We have several routers in our college classroom and this one is the one our instructor always pulls out. The vacuum system is fantastic. There is never a speck of sawdust in any of the mortises we cut. I'm buying this one
2,Not so good,"I've only bought this one and ""Humming by the Flowered Vine"". I bought ""Humming"" first and quite liked it. After that I followed it up with this one, but came up disappointed. Somehow it doesn't go anywhere, the songs all sound the same, and no standout songs. So I haven't bought a third. So if you want to try Laura try ""Humming""."
5,fresh as a mountain spring,"Vocals here are extra special. Hardly any need to say this, it's so obvious. Outstanding songs. If you play only the first 15 seconds of these songs: they work - a sure sign they are very strong and direct. Someone knows what they are doing. Her talents are actualy quite scary. Production is still quite rough but is better than the first album. The roughness adds to the charm perhaps. It would be interesting to see what would happen if serious dollars were thrown into the production in her next release. This would only be good if the producer was absolutely the best in the business. Getting certain things to sound better without losing LC's amazing vocals is the thing to concentrate on, but most folk couldn't do it i reckon. A few more like this first please. Anyway, this is a seriously wonderful album with fantastic variation in mood and a great flow."
2,Don't forget to clue in the viewer,"The strength of the film is its attempt to genuinely portray teenage apathy, relationships, and communication, all of which admittedly are often mis-portrayed in mainstream Hollywood films. But its strengths end there in my opinion. Some of the characters' actions feel forced or exaggerated, as if the viewer is incapable of discerning something in between black and white. Ironically though, the many (I would say way too many) musical interludes are wide open for interpretation, and come across as time fillers more than insight into the story or characters. There are two parallel stories in the film. The first is the accidental death of a security guard and the second is the main character(tm)s realization that long-term relationships are based on more than physical attraction. In the end though, I felt this film came up short on both fronts. Neither story was fully developed and instead the viewer feels left out like the parent of an apathetic teenager."
3,Not one of his better books,"Some of the pictures have a light background, making the etchings difficult/impossible to make out. Since the book is ordered by color, the same pattern appears several times. About 10% of the entries are labeled as ""Unidentified"". Only information is Company, Line, Pattern, Color pictured, height, and price. Would be nice to have (when available) the range of years produced, colors produced, etc. Was able to identify some of my pieces, though. A bargain book buy only."
4,Free-Format RPG IV - How to bring your RPG programs into the 21st Century,"This book is good for the developer that just needs to know the new syntax for the opcodes and new %BIF's. The examples are clear, but not every situation. I think overall it was good. It took me from standard RPG IV to free format and it was pretty painless."
5,Info,"Some nice infomation in this book, I am glad it does not take the 4-6 weeks to send that it says."
5,This book is awesome!!!!,"This book talks a lot about things to come and things happening right now in the world, except this book was written 100 years ago. Amazing"
3,Questions answered,"Did God create other worlds? what will have them be like? what are the ""end days"" events to take place before the close of time? what will have the like? questions I never even had were answered . . . this was a very interesting book. but it did not have a storyline narrative, it was a compilation of excerpts from the various writings of Ellen G White."
1,Not a good picture,I did not enjoy this movie in the least. I was expecting something at least halfway decent since I love the Charlie Chan movies and I was highly dissappointed. I am glad I only rented this.
1,A waste of time and money.,I cannot figure out why Amazon would charge its customers for this movie. It was horrible and I turned it off in minutes. Some Quality Control Employee needs to watch and reevalute this movie. Do not and I repeat do not waste your time or money on this movie. As the one star indicated I hated it.
1,This was awful!,This was Awful!. I thought it was a original Charlie Chan movie. This was a poorly executed spoof! I was very dissapointed. Do not waste your time ordering this movie.
2,not the pro nursing title you would imagine it to be,This book shows a child who nurses and the general tone is that even when she is weaned she will still be loved by her family. Very much a book for people trying to wean a child who is not quite ready. I purchased thinking it was a book that showed older children nursing in a positive light. It wasn't what I was expecting. My son (at the time 2 when I purchased) never did like the book.
2,I want the single versions! Not edited for content,"This collection is a letdown. Though the choice of songs cannot be argued (they're all proper choices), the versions of a few key hits are poor. For instance, hearing ""U.N.I.T.Y."" with the word ""b!tch"" edited out kind of defeats the purpose of this song. Also, including the single version of ""Ladies First,"" rather than the album version would be - if you're not a marketing wiz at Motown anyway - the natural choice. But no, it's the record version which does not have the sung chorus. These might seem like small things, but they really interfered with my enjoyment off the album.Queen Latifah's music is a hallmark in the hip-hop genre, but you wouldn't get that impression at all from this collection. Thanks, Motown."
4,"Great movie, terrible DVD transfer",One of my favorite movies. Great script and performances. All that is spoiled by the DVD transfer. The video is dark and grainy. It is the same quality as the VHS version.
2,Meh....,"Not really the cult classic that I heard it was. It was campy, cheesy and lacked depth. It didn't have that ""classic-timeless"" vibe to it that most of Newman's other films have. It seemed far fetched and felt really ""dated."" I'd pass on this one.."
4,A very different sound of Magnum,"Although I am very glad about a new record of Magnum, this new one has a very different sound. Now, it sounds more mature and with a very professional engineering work. I like it, but i feel that the material could be even better."
4,Thought-provoking,"While Stephenson isn't as careful a writer as I'd like, he does make many interesting assertions in the course of this essay. The metaphores and similes are mostly well handled, and the writing is straight-forward and non-technical enough for the average non-techie reader to follow. If the book is treated as the flow-of-consciousness essay it appears to be, then the minor flaws can be forgiven, allowing the reader to enjoy the sometimes brilliant writing that went into the work.I recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about what it means to use a windows/icons/mouse/pointer interface vs. the command line. Every little detail of what he says isn't true, but the overall themes he hits are at least arguably true. And the message of the book - that not only doesn't simpler equal better, it actually makes things worse for anyone but the most casual of users - is demonstrably true.Definitely worth a read."
3,Simplistic but Fun...Just like Windows!,I think Stephenson misses the point entirely. The PC beat the Mac because it managed to embrace computer gaming without being perceived as a toy. Let me ask you -- do you really think people buy 2 Ghz machines to run Office?
1,In the Beginning,Not timely. Not relevant. Not worth it!His other stuff is great but this should be pulled from the shelves.
2,Before the command line,"Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy Neal Stephenson's books. The historical content he winds into his plots is engaging. However, I have been working with the micro computer since before the command line. Neal, you have the title wrong. In the beginning was the Monitor. No doubts in my mind. My right hand is still trained to enter octal codes on a keypad at lightening speed! The Command line came much later, more like the coalescence of matter in the Universe when clumps of useful things needed some impactful gravity. The Monitor was there before the clumps and after the octal toggle switches, address load and register load momentary switches. The Monitor got the human fingers attached to the computer once and for all. So, 2 stars because the title is just wrong!"
3,A few good ideas,"I expected a lot when I sat down to read this book, and I was disappointed. However, it has virtues that make it worth reading. First, it is very short and easy to read. Second, it is relatively entertaining. Third, it gives a thoughtful and seldom voiced perspective on the future of Microsoft and the dominance of their OS. Its shortcomings are that it rambles, goes off on irrelevant tangents, has some very weak and poorly supported arguments, and assumes total technological illiteracy of the reader."
4,Really Good for a Tribute Album,"Basically, after reading a lot of other reviews, I've noticed the point of view they had, for the most part, was from a strictly power metal opinion. Nothing wrong with that, but to down-credit Children of Bodom, and Cradle of Filth due to their style and speed is rather unfair, though I like Children of Bodom's cover of ""The Trooper"" better than ""Aces high"". Sinergy was an interesting touch to hear a female vocalist try to cover Bruce's soaring vocals. She did alright. I don't mind the screaming vocals of Cradle of Filth, or lower vocals of Dark Tranquility, but I can't get into Six Feet Under's cover. Cookie Monsters from Sesame Street need not sing on an album. Opeth... Best Clean vocals ever!!! And Sonata Arctica aka Stratovarius II is also a great addition this album."
1,"These movies blow, great for a laugh though.","The acting is so poor its, allmost funny. I think Ill break these dvd i cant even give them away. There so bad that they burn a movie on each side so not to waste one whole Disk. By acting in theses movies they ended there career. I think the only uses for ""till death do us part"" is a form of cruel and unusual punishment. I mean for the love of god were the makers High?...or just low on film so they coulld not take ""re-takes""? If you see this movie on sale even for a god damn penny DONT by it! You will end up in a coma."
2,"Well, it's better than ""Mazes and Monsters""","A fantasy-prone geeky kid (so geeky that the other members of his role-playing group taunt him) dies and a BLACK KNIGHT rises up to avenge him. Kind of ho-hum in that there is no nudity (that's actually okay given the cast), the violence is on par with a made-for-TV movie, and the plot is pretty predictable. I liked the effort that they put into it to make RPGs seem sinister and sexy."
3,Knighty Knightmare...,"A group of role-playing game enthusiasts gather every saturday night in their teacher's basement for swords, sorcery, and beers. One guy (played by Michael Wayne Walton) is a little bit TOO into the game, fantasizing about his knightly role with a girl gamer, who wants nothing to do with him. The bozo winds up driving into a tree and burning up, moments after swearing an oath to the great knight-of-the-rose pantheon. Soon, other saturday night gamers start turning up dead, cut to pieces by a dark knight on a big horse. Police are baffled, but we're not! I liked most of this movie. Not bad for a micro-budget indie..."
3,Interesting...,"I enjoyed this book. It behooves us to search for lessons from the past, which this book provides in a dose that is very relevant.My primary complaint would be the number of distracting grammar or other minor errors which detract from the overall thrust of the book. Who's this shoe bomber, Richard Read? Is he related to Richard Reid? I re-read a few sentences only to realise they were missing a word here or there.I'm no grammar fiend, but it's annoying enough that I picked up a pen to start editing this book."
3,Not oversized grids,"There are a ton of Sudoku books out there. I bought this one because I was looking for over-sized grids. The write-up stated: ""JUMBO SUDOKU 2 has oversized grids so you have extra room to help you solveits a real treat for puzzle lovers!"" But this is not true. There are generally two puzzles per page, so they are in fact smaller than Total Sudoku which has only one puzzle per page. Other than that, both the puzzles and the instructions in the front are good."
2,sorry I bought it,"I'm sorry I bought this. The cover shows a full-page puzzle, but there are 2 puzzles per page. I don't want an 8 X 10 page, which is awkward to hold, with 2 puzzles on it. If I get only half-page-size puzzles, give me a half-page-size book to hold. I love Mepham's ""Total Sudoku"" -- which has full-page puzzles with lots of space for solving. Buy it instead. (The amazon.com cover also shows that ""Jumbo Sudoku 2"" has 200 puzzles; there are actually 400.)"
3,Not so good,"Wonderful to look at with nice shots of Montmatre at night and a good opening during a Paris dawn. Also, the ""bad"" girl Anne is worth looking at twice.But the story is full of holes and bad editing especially in the last 15 minutes. And this is to the detriment of the film in such a way as to render the film no more than a stylish exercise as opposed to a true heist film or noir classic.If your intent is to look at pioneering film of the French New Wave or to see how the French appreciate Hollywood film noir, then by all means RENT it.But if you want to see a wonderfully realized French heist movie of the same period with a true understanding of noir, then find yourself a copy of Jules Dassin's RIFIFI, which is a far superior movie."
3,Meh. Never read the book,"I haven't read the book and decided to watch this movie instead. I can say that I know why I couldn't get into the book and am glad that I never got beyond the first 10 pages. To say its a disturbing story is to greatly understate it. In this adaptation, I really enjoyed most of the acting except for Riley. She didn't seem to have much emotion to her. And there were parts where the story seemed to jump a bit but I got the gist of it. In all, not a bad movie, but I don't see what the big deal is with this story. I think the whole martyr thing is overrated."
3,Enjoyable,"Wuthering Heights is a very interesting story and definitely a classic. I really enjoyed both of the women that portrayed Catherine. Both beautiful and well acted.****SPOILER****What I didn't like was the actor playing Heathcliff. I also didn't like that they changed the ending and he shot himself. If that were the true ending he should've done it as soon as Catherine died. Why live out all those years without her if you're going to commit suicide in the end anyway.Also for a long movie, I didn't like that the story still felt rushed and other scenes were changed. I wish the movie was longer and closer to the actual story."
5,review of purchase,this was a great experience. i placed my order and received the dvd within the timeframe that was specified on my confirmation.
1,Horrible!,The acting was so off! All the characters we're shallow and lacked development. I feel like they made the movie way too romantic.Right now I'm trying to rewind this movie out of my brain.
4,Reliable for a low-end PC with 1 drive...,"I have had one of these powered on almost continuously since 2010 in a low-end PC (Intel 2.6 Ghz E5300 Dual core..). It only has 1 SATA power which is fine since my PC has 1 SATA drive and no other components. I replaced the original with a new one in November 2012 not because it died, but because the fan started to vibrate. I could stop the vibration by tapping the fan, but did not want the chance of noise when it was left unattended in an office environment."
5,An Atmospheric Wonder!,"This film is actually fun both visually and audibly. Welles has a great voice to begin with, so when he's voicing Shakespeare (in deliciously over-the-top fashion?!) his delivery is even more captivating. Also, the brooding/hellish set design is perfect for this play, which is filmed in exquisite B&W. No colors to distract here: this film is ALL MEAT."
4,A master at work,"Orosn Welles' version is an excellent, dark adaptation of the classic Shakespeare play. The movie was made on a pretty low budget, but the lighting and camera work, as in all Orson Welles films, is fantastic. It's a very dark, gloomy, foggy black-and-white look. I especially liked the scenes with the three Weird Sisters, the witches who tell Macbeth of his fate.The acting is, of course, excellent. Welles really understands Shakespeare and he shows it in his performance as Macbeth. Lady Macbeth is also very good, Jeanette Nolan."
1,Barry's Swan Songs,"I bought this album the day it was released. I should have waited for some reviews. Every song sounds like it was enhanced. I loved barry's old albums,but this one's not for me. Too strange!!!"
1,A misunderstanding,Gothard does not teach that the old-testament laws are to be kept for salvation. The old-testament law shows a reflection of God's nature in the whole scheme of things. The whole counsel of God is important to understand and the underlying principles behind them. This is what Bill Gothard teaches in the IBLP seminar ministry.
2,Also disappointed by DVD quality,"I was excited by this movie coming out on DVD because this is a wonderful movie but the quality of the DVD picture and sound was awful. The content of this movie is 5 stars, as far as I am concerned, but the quality of the DVD is 1 or 2 stars."
4,A super magical story!,"This is a great story, which takes the characters of the classic tales of Arthur's court and puts them in a totally new and challenging situation. This story has strong female characters and a mood of excitement throughout the story. The children are very real. Being only 15 myself, I can verify that these are genuine people with three-dimensional personalities.This story is fun to read!"
1,is this foto copied?,"why my book looks like it's been fotocopied?????it doesn't have any color, and all the pictures are blurred because it is suppose to be colored.. I tried to look at it in a textbook bookstore and they all have color.... is it legal???I got it from amazon not the marketplace."
3,"Food is good, but.....","So far I've liked all the recipes that I've tried from this book. They are very simple and easy to make using widely available food. However, I do not like the binding either, not for the price. Also, I prefer to avoid all artificial sweetners. Too many of the recipes call for it in my opinion, and I'm not just talking about the dessert recipes. Finally, I'm not sure how serving sizes were determined. Using children?? Some of the recipes I've had to double up on the serving sizes just to make a decent portion. This isn't really a big problem as long as you remember to double your carb count too, but it irritates me."
3,Och Aye! The Scots Lose to the Irish,"I bought this book after having read and enjoyed some of its Irish inspirations - Ladies Night at Finbar's Hotel, Irish Girls About Town, etc.I'm sorry to report that these short stories from Scottish female authors are not nearly as engaging or as lively. There were a few gems - ""In the Garden of Mrs. Pink"" tells of a young girl's encounter with a lady of disrepute through charmingly innocent eyes. ""School-Gate Mums,"" about a single mom/hitwoman, was so cynical and over-the-top that, despite the exciting story line, it just depressed me. But most of the stories were basically un-memorable. Overall, disappointing."
2,They wait to ship the very last minute possible,If you are ordering your books for school and need them soon don't consider them because the wait until the last minute possible to ship and you get it later than you think should. My class had already started before I got my book.
3,not bad,"Teaches Waltz, Rumba, and Salsa on all three tapes. You certainly can't beat the price. We found it to be good, with a decent number of steps for the money. The music is fifties-style oldies, which really doesn't fit the tuxes on the cover. He does very clearly teach the moves. You'll need to go elsewhere to learn style points and how to make the dances flow."
5,Dao De Jing for Creativity,"This was a book that I stumbled upon quite by accident. I was looking forThe Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick)when I found this. I flipped throught the pages and immediately bought it. I have read it cover to cover several time (Truly, something that can be accomplished in a matter of hours). It is a book, to my mind, more like the Dao De Jing in that it doesn't tell a story, but gives you a way to live a better (work) life. It also reminds me ofReady for Anything: 52 Productivity Principles for Work and Lifein that that book is very ""Dao"" like. If you work with or around creative people, I have to highly recommend this book."
4,Simple yet inspirational,"This book is a very simple book with a powerful message. You can probably finish reading the entire book in 20 minutes. However, the lessons that are taught in this book are quite memorable. Each ""chapter"" contains a life lesson in a very succinct and graphic format. Each lesson probably has less than 10 sentences long but i must confess the lessons really stick in your mind and i often find myself revisiting it again whenever self-doubts arise. It's definitely worth checking out."
3,"There are worse, and there are better","Read a few pages in a book store a while back, and found myself ordering it a few days later. Short and sweet to the point, good visuals, and some good ideas and motivational words of wisdom. Not the greatest, not the worst, In all honesty, id go and pick it up in a shop, read through it and save yourself the $10 bucks"
5,Great motivation for anyone doing anything creative,"Before you get confused by the ""World's best selling book"" tagline, read the title of the book again. ""It's not how good you are, it's how good you want to be."" Obviously, Arden aspires to have this be the world's best selling book.All of the advice in this book comes out of Arden's experience in the advertising industry, but it has value for everyone doing work in creative fields. (And as many have said, business as a whole is a creative pursuit.) Even the advice that seems to be advertising-centric has wider relevance, if you open your mind a bit.There's a lot of very good advice in this book, presented in a very easy to digest format. I come back to this book again and again whenever I need a pep talk, and every time it works. How are being unafraid of failure, having ambition, and being open to new ideas not relevant to your life?"
3,Lots of inspiring quotes but is it worth the price?,"This book is packed with wisdom and insights on how to succeed in any creative based business. It will inspire you and push you to heights you never knew you can reach However, the way it is written/presented makes it one of tthe greatest rip-offs of the year. It is basically a collection of one liners and phrases. Not that what's written are rubbish (it is very helpful) but some are obvious common sense. It is a very quick read, I managed to read the WHOLE book in a bookstore while standing. This where I balk at recommending this book for purchase. Borrow it from someone or wait when for it in the bargain bin or used books section because spending for the cover price is not worth the content."
1,"Not for everyone, short of a book","This isn't a book, but a collection of vague ideas, in huge font, aimed towards those in the advertising/marketing field. Of course, this isn't evident from the blurb or the title, misleading one into thinking that it is a motivational book for all.The ideas are few, haphazardly linked, and the message simple and obvious. You may find use in this if you are in the above line of work, but even then, I think there are much better books on the subject than this."
5,Everything that looks simple is not simple.,"Brandin is a heartwarming fable about a bull whose gentleness gets him in a lot of trouble. The book's message comes home to all of us as we begin to understand that the first thing we have to project or market to the world is ourselves. The power of the book lies in the simple but complicated revelation that each one of us can control the way the world sees us, not by artifice, but with warmth, intelligence and honesty. This is a great little book that can be used equally for children, adults and across the board for professionals from high powered executives to lab scientists. A quick and penetrating read. Liked it a lot."
1,Do not buy this phone.,"Both the handset cord and the line cord are permanently connected to the telephone. You cannot replace either cord. The line cord is only six feet long...if your jack is too far away, you're out of luck. If either cord becomes damaged...you're out of luck, the phone becomes worthless. Note that Amazon suggests a longer handset cord as an accessory, which you cannot use. There's no excuse for building the phone this way; it is very unusual."
1,The worst consumer product I have ever bought,"This is a classic example of General Electric's vaunted six sigma philosophy. It is clearly a six sigma product...six sigmas in bad design:-It has 10 number memory dialing, but you can only enter the number, not the name that goes with it. You want to call your good friend Taylor? Good luck which memory location you stored the number in.-A mentioned by others, the cord situation is a disaster.-I bought this in Argentina, where I am currently living, but the caller ID appears to have been set up to only work in the U.S.-It practically falls out of the cradle if you so much as look at it.-The battery case does not stay open.-No clue in the instructions how to set the date and clock.In my entire life I cannot recall a single consumer product that I felt was more of a waste of money than this. When I buy from GE from now on, I'll stick to light bulbs."
2,Great phone except a battery hog,"I have used one of these phones for over 3 years. The sound quality is good. The caller id function works well.The only problem is that it uses 4 AA batteries every few months. Unless you use rechargeable batteries, you will spend more on batteries than on the phone itself. However, this is true of all corded phones that I have owned with caller id, and we have several. Many years ago, I owned a stand alone caller id display that used 1 AA battery that lasted well over a year, so why are these such battery hogs? Manufacturers should display average battery life on the box along with the number of batteries it uses."
2,It's Ok,"After reading all the great reviews I decided to buy this book for my 2-year-old son. I was pretty disappointed with it. The poems lack any real information about the animals and, in a lot of cases, are simply wrong. Maybe I'm spoiled by the Douglas Florian books, which my son and I absolutely love, but I think if you're looking for something worthwhile to read to your children (something fun that's not just inaccurate fluff) this is not it."
3,"Great western,",Good read. Book was had slightly more damage than I expected (ink writing inside) but overall was worth the price paid.
1,Wish I could say something nice....,"I expected a well crafted story with nuggets of wisdom freely imparted to the reader. Instead, I found myself growing irritated as I read the book - not exactly the type of vibration I want! The book reads like a first draft for a mediocre school writing project. The story is choppy, the dialogue horrible and the ""nuggets of wisdom"" unoriginal. This was one of those very rare times when I've read a book and wished I had spent the time reading something else. I have great respect for Hay House and am surprised they would have published this."
3,Good read,"The story is heart-warming and a lot of the philosphies are very practical and helpful. I felt the book was a little preachy at times and looked at everything from a high perspective. I think that is what you get with a book like this- a broad, broad range of advice. You can not incorporate everything you learn but if you can take a few points, it is very beneficial. I like a lot of the quotes that were used. Very thought-provoking. All in all, good advice, the story itself is a little unbelievable but a fun ride."
4,Good read,The only why I got this is because I am a surfer... It's a good story about balance and a good reminder how we can live life to the fullest.
4,I like it,The better point to start when you`re a Java Developer. Reading these book I understood all to start development using C# for web and console applications.
2,No depth,"This book sucks... I don't know why others ranked it high. I thought it would be more compact because it skims over topics that Java developers are aware of but still goes into depth on topics that are new to Java people. I've read through the first 6 chapters and it skims over every topic! It does not give an in depth explinataion of how things work and why. Topics like the runtime environment, memory management and other things should definitly be more in depth. Im switching back to the other book I have Pro C# with .Net 3.0. Overall C# for Java Developers has been the most bland, uninsightful programming books I've read."
4,Still need to try the product,"I am traveling abroad. I ordered Sedu Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron Hair Straightener (Euro Edition) from Folica and I got within 3 days, there was a miss understanding because of the voltage (I ordered something that works with 220-240V) but the consumer manual stated 110-120V. I managed to call them and they confirmed it is the product I ordered! I am traveling soon so i will be able to tell then!! But the service was excellent!"
2,Mixed Bag,"I've always liked her on ""Will & Grace,"" but never knew MM was a singer. I bought this CD having been charmed by MM's rendition of Tom Waits's ""Take It with Me"" on David Letterman. I absolutely love the vulnerable, haunting quality of the low-key selections. Her voice IS about as big as a berry--which, on a simple, lovely song like ""Lament,"" is a gift. But she can't manage the several upbeat numbers, like ""Bathroom Window."" Her voice simply isn't big enough to pull it off, at least to my ear. When she really tries to get big (as at the end of an otherwise touching version of ""Danny Boy,"") I find her almost abrasive. BUT: I'd recommend it anyway. I just skip over what I don't like and enjoy the rest."
4,The best N.E. full-length CD!,"Nitzer Ebb is still one of the most influential ebm artists to date. Showtime is, without a doubt, Nitzer Ebb at their prime. Pounding beats and mechanical bass lines compliment McCarthy's powerful vocals.And just a little trivia, Nitzer Ebb opened for Depeche Mode on Mode's World Violation tour in 1990/91, just after Showtime was released - they put on an amazing show! ...both bands :)In my opinion, the only other N.E. release that tops Showtime, is As-Is, which hosts the song Come Alive, produced and mixed by then Depeche Mode's Alan Wilder (who also collaborated with McCarthy on a couple of Recoil projects) - however and unfortunately, As-Is is only an E.P.Highly recommended for the ebm-curious and synthpop fans alike."
4,Great read,I really enjoyed this little book. It was like sitting down with a good friend and hearing her life story. It felt very raw and honest. I only wish I knew who she was!!
5,Excellent!,I love this gum and its so easy to get it and have it shipped. Oh and it's cheaper than any other place.
2,Waste of money & time,"This is a totally lame product. Most of what Patti Stanger preaches is just not practical or sensible. To me this is just someone capitalizing on their publicity in the dating business. If you're gonna buy it, don't buy it new. Not worth it."
1,Disappointing and not what I expected,This video was not at all what I expected. It was a guide for someone who hasn't even met anyone yet. Patty's timeline is also completely unrealistic. I am just glad it didn't cost me very much.
2,for the (very) average person,"I was pretty disappointed with this dvd. It did have some good pointers, but it did not cover anything about special issues such as being older, dating after children, etc. This dvd is for the young single who has not been married or had children before. I also thought that some of the messages that a guy isnt going to like you if you dont look like a supermodel were disheartening and wrong. Basically, this dvd is good if you don't have a clue."
1,Pass this copy by,"I just purchased this "" The Fighting Kentuckian "", Pass it up. It is a horrible print. After 5 minutes I had to stop watching, it was hurting my eyes. Its amazing what gets passed off to the public."
5,ROCKS,This CD rocks....the band sounds killer and the mixes are awesome !! Highly recommended for a road trip..
5,Blue Oyster Cult's Fourth Live Album Is Yet Another Great One,"LONG DAYS NIGHT, Blue Oyster Cult's fourth live CD, is yet another great one, featuring the three core members (Eric Bloom Donald ""Buck Dharma"" Roeser, and Allen Lanier) and the band's new rhythm section performing material from the band's entire 30-year history. Of particular note is ""Harvest Moon"", the one great song from 1998's disappointing HEAVEN FORBID. This is a CD that you should own."
1,Confused,"I don't get it???? It may be me but Booth seems to be pretty ""high"" himself when he wrote this. There are pages of what the and who the hell is he talking about and with??? The problem may be that I just finished Keith Richards ""Life""Lifeand this alleged ""...true and masterpiece story of the RS..."" is confusing, disjointed and let's just say I ain't gonna bother finishing it. It lacks any kind of insightful information and I feel I need a few tabs of acid just to remotrely understand what Booth was attempting to say and convey. Don't waste your money. Google the Stones and you'll get more accurate information with both insight and introspection. I can't understand how Stanley Booth is considered a ""rock journalist"" and allegedly a good one??? This book needs some organized structure and clarification of who, what and whatever he is talking about before he writes it!!!!! GgV"
5,Excellent. A Rolling Stones & Brian Jones Bio in one.,"Stanely Booth does an excellent job writing about the Stones from their early humble beginnings to 1969 at the Alamount Speedway. Not only did he travel one-one with the band members he also travelled around England and interviewed Brian Jones' parents and the Stones long-time roadie Ian Stewart. You learn about their beginnings and Brian Jones' demise. Having travelled and 'hung out' with the band he paints a vivid picture of the day-to-day lifestyle of the Stones and the culture of 1960's. It's not a book filled with endless stories about groupies and partying (there are some) but rather a 360 degree look at the band. Also a frightening eye-witness account of the murders and chaos at Alamount Speedway.Would recommended to anybody interested in the Rolling Stones, Brian Jones, Alamount or just the 1960's in general. Very good."
3,d-skin,1st of all this is not a game and the item came in time but was missing pieces you could say. i contacted the seller and got a full refund because of their mistake but overall good customer support/service.
2,too good to be true,"This product did not deliver as promised. Mychildren scratch alot of our dvd's, so i thought this would be perfect. Well, our dvd player was not always able to read the dvd with the d-skin on, the skins would fall off, or tore very easily. I wish i could return it, but about a third of the pack is already damaged. There should be a better solution."
2,Doesn't work,"I also really hoped these would work, but not only will most of my DVD players not read through the skin, they broke my kids' portable DVD. My guess is the added thickness to the DVD damaged the laser. I still leave them on when the DVD's are not in the players, but have to take them off before watching anything. It would be better if they were easier to get off since that is the case. They do protect against scratches, but watch out for damage to your players."
1,Doesn't work for XBOX 360,"I purchased these because one particular XBox 360 game was always getting scratched. I applied the product as instructed, but it would NOT read the game. Tried other game disks and still would not work. It DOES work with any of my DVD movies in my DVD player, but that's NOT why I bought the product. Other than performing some warranty-voiding hacks, my son came up with the trick of adding small pieces of paper under the closed tray door, to increase the angle that the game disk sat. That seems to have fixed the problem, for now."
3,Pretty good overview,"I found this to be a very good book for a beginner which I am. It gives a good overview of what you need and how to use them. I also like that it gives a good bit of information about some advanced techniques. In summary, not great but enough to get me started -- which was my goal."
1,sinergy,This is a mediocre album at best. The music is ok but the singer really (...) - voice is sloppy. That's what has ruined the whole cd.
3,Super Reader,"Invisible man wild card.This book is set in the part of Niven's future history where organlegging as such, is very common. Set on a colony world the wealthy want access to body parts, so any crime gets you executed and recycled for their use.Throw in a wild card superpowered outsider with basically the power to cloud men's minds and things get interesting."
4,Good book,"To simply put it, this was a very good book and an easy read too, however many typos and errors. But other than that i loved the book."
2,Sony M-675V Microcassette Voice Recorder,I was very disappointed in this item. It claims to be voice activated--I've followed the instructions but I have never had this feature work. When I have recorded a message the playback is very noisy either though there is no background noise when the recording is being made. I would not recommend this item.
1,NO BOOTY IN BOOTY CALL,"Thats right, there is no booty calling in booty call. Expecting to see some cute beach girls dancing rythmically and exotically? None of that. Expect to see a dance contest or a wet t-shirt contest? None of that. Film consists of 3 girls, mostly walking on a beach or sitting in a waterfall and occasionally putting you to sleep while attempting to remove bikinis or lingerie, but this only now and then. Absolutely nothing happens, you will be terribly disappointed. You can always use the tape as a scratch in a pinch, you won't view it twice. Truth be told."
3,A little disappointed in the DVD quality,It's a Carey Grant movie-love it. I am disappointed that it was not re-mastered. I have a Blu-ray player and Samsung LCD TV with 7.1 surround system. The system automatically resizes for best quality. Which for me means the picture is not widescreen. The sound is not digital quality either. Given the option of watching on a VCR or this DVD-I would still pick the DVD. A little disappointed in the quality.
3,OK,The memory of the movie was better than the reality. Grant has much better vehicles................
1,Operation Petticoat,"Copy was not a good one. Kept fading ""light to dark"".Was too busy to return, but not happy with it.Good movie - bad copy.Movie Buff"
2,"Too much social stuff, not enough action! Women would like!","I am just not too much of a fan of social interaction movies. As a comedy, this is a fair movie. But for a war movie, this movie lacks action. Women should like this movie much better though."
3,Love the movie but not the format...,The 3 stars for this DVD are for the fact that it's a non-anamorphic 4:3 picture. The plot and premise are pure cotton candy but Cary Grant (main reason for buying this) carries the day.
3,"Interesting view, primarily from the Kennedy side of campaign","Gave a great deal of insight into the Kennedy campaigns, but less useful comparison from Nixon side. Would have been more useful if were more equal, as was the campaign of the insider against the new face, but the writer was more involved with the Kennedy side. Nonetheless, gave some insight on both sides.Not as sure as some historians are that it is going to give much added understanding of how the 2008 campaigns are likely to be run, or the problems they are going to face."
5,classic world music,"I bought this Vinyl when it came out and I still find it totally, TOTALLY listenable. In theearly 70s the US exposure to Raggae was incredibly limited. In fact, world music as we know itwas certainly in its distribution infancy. This is a gotta have. (the movie's not bad either!)"
3,Symmetry but not for everonei,"It started very nice, author has very nice way of introducing concept of symmetry with easy introduction. He gives good examples of symmetry in Physics from Newtonian and Einstein Physics. I wish there was some formalism that would show where the symmetry shows itself in the formulations. Then subject goes to invariance transformations. Subject becames exteremely difficult for popular scientist who does not know Particle Physics and all the concepts comes with it. Overall it shows that the concept of Symmetry is very strong tool in Physics as long as you look for the right and meaningfull symmetry."
2,weak construction,"I have a different version then the one pictured, but as far as I can tell they are the same, just the box is a different color. my stamp based are resin it seems and not plastic. It says they will only slide into the base one way so I wished to test the direction before affixing the stamp itself. Well it didn't want to slide figure I had the wrong way, I got it in, then had a hard time removing it. I know better tight then loose I guess. The problem was I go to slide the stamp base back in, it hits the end & the end lip breaks. Two pieces broke off...not just cracked, but fully broke. OH yeah before even that I do to remove the holder from the packaging & the Bast figure broke off the base. Luckily in one piece so easily fixed on my part. I just hope my repair to the holder part works to make it still usable. Mine was a blue box instead of the tan, but everything else looks the same."
5,"Comprehesive, well written, excellent photography","I recently saw this book in a library, and I knew right away that I had to have a copy. Christian Seguret does a masterful job of providing a comprehensive history of the development of this most versatile instruments. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves guitars."
1,Ninety Bucks????,"This lego set is a must have for any young fans of F1, or perhaps a collector as well. It's very well made, as all lego sets generally are. I gave this a 1 star rating because the price from these Amazon sellers is totally ridiculous. I picked two of these up for under $30/ea from ebay this Christmas including shipping. Amazon should monitor and ban sellers who price gouge."
4,Difficult to find,"Finally found the blades after looking every where. The razor is expensive, but the blades are even more so. They make them so you have to buy a new razor every few years."
5,Had for years,I have had my Norelco cordless shaver for a lot of years and these blades make it like the first day I purchased it.
3,Its just Apple care and this is one of the best places to get it,"Its really nice that this can all be done online now, no need to waste energy shipping some paper out to you.... Worked well and was instant coverage gratification, great deal..."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this sandbox for my granddaughters. They loved the sandbox because it is so colorful. Unfortunately, it isn't durable at all. The bottom is a loose liner and the sand is constantly leaking out. If I had known it didn't have an attached solid bottom, I wouldn't have purchased it. Also, it has an attachable umbrella, but it comes out too easily."
1,"GOOD MOVIE,BUT NOT THE DVD!","Liked this movie, lots action, but like rest of them I DO NOT buy this DVD. Because No DTS Or Double disk, I know end of the road,and soon enough they gonna come with, DirCut or DTS Or Double disk . Like they did with rest of the movies these days . So don't waste Ur money for this DVD ."
1,Blu-ray - not at theatrical aspect ratio,"Since the movie is several years old, anyone considering this purchase would know if they like the film or if they do not. This review involves the Blu-Ray version. It has three major drawbacks. The first is that the release is remastered in the aspect ratio of 1:85. The DVD and theactrical aspect ratio is 2:35 thus about 20% of the right and left sides of the film have been cropped. This would lead one to believe that it was a version that was originally produced for HDTV. This theory is further supported by the fact that there are absolutely no bonus features on the disc....none whatsover. There is not even a start up menu screen. The film simply begins when put in the player. There are also audio-video sync problems throughout the film. The image quality is exceptional, but if you own the DVD, I would not upgrade in blu-ray, as you lose more that you gain."
4,Leaned toward a tv movie,"Bruce willis is always great in all his roles. Still I think this movie had alot of scenes that would be better suited in a tv flick vs a blockbuster. The begining is pretty good as is the end; but the movie could have been alot better with a little more expansion on bruce willis' connection with his family and with a little less of the ""crazy teenager"". The teenager was just a bit too much for me."
3,"Average thriller, interesting twists","The twists, turns and action do save this over-the-top thriller, so I'd definately give it a recommendation in the rental category, however, I think the fact that it needed saving leaves it in the why-see-it-twice? category.B.W. is a great action/adventure/thriller actor, so any half way decent plot involving him and guns is usually fun to watch, this movie just pushed the envelope a bit in trying to be clever.In any case, I thought it was fun to watch, and after all, sometimes that's all a movie needs to be."
4,"ACTION PACKED, THRILL RIDE!","Bruce is back! This movie kept me glued, from beginning to end.Lots of twists and turns, and action packed! I heard this moviewas good, and for a change they're right!"
3,Unfairly panned by the critics?,"Okay. We're not talking a great film here. But we are talking about a very entertaining popcorn piece that has been, IMHO, unfairly panned by critics. Yes, the plot is so full of holes that you could float an aircraft carrier through it. It IS enormously silly & outrageous. But this is an action flick fer cryin out loud. It's for entertainment and it does that well. Okay, so Bruce Willis goes way over the top with some of his scenes. I strongly suspect the director behind this, urging Willis on. Or maybe it was Willis' decision to have complete mental breakdowns throughout the flick. Whatever the reason, Willis is a very good actor and,in spite of some very cheesy moments, plays his character very, very well. Yeah, okay, it's cliche-ridden as hell & is fairly formulaic, but damnit, it's a good action flick & very entertaining. In spite of it's obvious flaws, I had a good time watching it."
5,I love PDKTF,"I could use many words to talk about how wonderful this book is. But i will keep it simple. Everyone: should read it. I never knew you could fall in love with a book, but i have, i have. I love Trope's writing and everything she writes about. It was a great piece about highschool life, etc."
2,Embarrassing.,"The reviewer from School Library Journal thinks dorks will be empowered if they see that the flower poet Z scored a major wad of cash from the NY publishing world. How sad is that? Sad for the NY publishing world, sadder still for the reviewer at SLJ who thinks this is a reason to praise a book. Ms. Trope's book should have been left as the chapbook it was originally published as. That was indulgent enough.Midway through the book, Ms. Trope expresses the concern that she may some day be embarrassed by some photos of herself and a lover. Nahh. What will be embarrassing, if she does continue to write and publish, is this book. Hopefully, she'll get that education she passed up to go on book tour before writing #2."
4,Read if you like good literature,"This book is a thing of beauty. I understand that many people are offended by the sharp, crude way Zoe sees the world, but it really is quite a clever way of writing- sometimes poetry form, sometimes short, broken sentences- this is the diary of a teenaged girl. This is not a book for the prejudiced or narrow-minded. This is a beautiful work of art that many are blinded by. This is the deep truth that everyone chooses to overlook or cover up."
2,Go ahead - kill them,"I'd heard mixed things about this book, and after reading it, I see why. It's not great but it's not terrible. It's a teenage girl's journal, nothing more. (Actually, it's about 100 pages ""more"" than it needs to be, so maybe it was better as a chapbook.) I read a lot of young adult books, and this just doesn't stand out. It's not clear whether or not this girl is talented enough to become a writer, but this bland book is not a terribly auspicious debut."
2,Yawn of the plastic disc.,"Another band that sounds like fifty others in exsistance. THE VINES tackle the same sound a hundred times better. Is there any originality left out there? There's none here, that's for sure."
2,Outdated,This book is for Rhinoceros Release 2.0 however the current version of Rhino is 3.0. This might sound like a minor detail but a lot of the illustrations in the book will not match what is showing on your screen which makes learning frustrating.
5,Wonderful Irish Music,This CD is great with the often lost music of the harp included; not to mention Moya (Marie) Brennan's haunting voice. I recommended to anybody who loves Irish Celtic music.
5,Two horizons,...Hard to believe when the heart is so brokencourage be born than our world will stop hurting...ending track two horizons: simply the best!I highly suggest to hear this masterpiece!
4,For Anyone that enjoy's Celtic Music,This is fine Cd with great songs and vocal's.This will most likely please all the celtic fan's out there.
5,Also FANTASTIC!,"There's only one word to describe Two Horizons, the new solo album of Moya Brennan, Enya sister and ex voice of Clannad and it is: FANTASTIC!!! Her ethereal voice united with the wonderful celtic music will relax all stressed people after the work... Two Horizons is rich of dreaming melodies and angelic chorus... Every song is a story... If you like Enya music, you must buy this wonderful album! It's the best Moya's album ever... It's really fantastic!!!"
5,"Funny, lovely, cute!","This is really the amazing new way to see babies. They are pictured as little bears, dolls etc. Anne Geddes shows again her fantasy. And finally - this calendar is quality stuff."
1,Kitsch and Completely Disgusting...,"Geddes' manages to degrade and isolate her subjects. Her prehistoric ""cutsie"" images, though appealing to a kitsch market, do not allow for a social comment to transcend the visual confines of her exploitive commercial ""photography"". In some senses, she could be seen as a radical post-modernist artist, as she abstracts the subject from social normality and removes any dignity from the development of the child, if that was her so calling in contemporary art. Yet it is frightening to be in an age where people will grasp such superficially degrading images. Geddes has made a personal fortune off photographing babies, subjects usually positioned in inhumane circumstances (ie: babies in flowerpots or dipped in custard), which removes human dignity and allows us to question Geddes moral intent."
4,Kirinyaga - a stately African genesis,"Koriba, a distinguished, educated man of Kikuyu ancestry builds a utopian colony on a terraformed planetoid. Like a benign god, he reinstates ancient customs, stringent laws & decides everyone's fate. In time the people's desire for knowledge brings him his greatest struggle. Mike Resnick calls this his finest work & I'm going to agree with him, from a man's perspective. Being a woman this had a biblical breadth to it & we all know what happens to women in the bible. The idea of starting over again is appealing & while I consider the idea gives me opportunities to refresh my own life each night, joining a sect or cult to start up another Eden, makes me very, very nervous. Given our history, what makes us assume we're going to get it right this time? It takes a lot of practice to undo millennia of behavioral modifications, ask the Kosovo residents: Christian & Moslem alike. This is a thinking read - stayed with me for months! END"
1,Can I give this 0 stars?,"I bought this in order to listen to my Creative Zen Vision W 30GB MP3 player. The first set of speakers arrived and I received 2 right speakers, no left speaker and the subwoofer. Packaged that up to ship back this weekend and received a second set of speakers today. In this set the subwoofer did not work AT ALL. So, I opened up the first speaker set and tried the other subwoofer and, on full volume, the sound was only marginally louder than I was getting just listening to my MP3 player WITHOUT SPEAKERS. And, if I wiggle any of the wires there is static and the sound is lost. Obviously, this is going back too.Will not be purchasing a THIRD speaker set."
4,COTTON TALES,"A widely acclaimed novel by Richard Adams is the basis for this sometimes somber tale of a group of rabbits who leave their warren behind and go out in search of new digs. While children may find the rabbits fascinating at times, there is an uncommon amount of violence and bloodletting for an animated film. For adults, however, WATERSHIP DOWN is a refreshing change of pace in the cutesy animals animated field. Voiced by several notable British character actors (including John Hurt and Harry Andrews), the movie is a striking look at intercommunal living and the mysticism of the animal world. A lovely song written by Mike Batt and performed by Art Garfunkel (Bright Eyes) adds a Disneyish flavor, but this is no typical Disney like fare. Some children may find it frightening and depressing, but it's still worth a look."
4,Some movies are ageless,"This is one of those movies which can stand the test of time, almost 30 years after it was released.For those of us who saw this movie when it was still considered new, in the late 70's and even into the early 80's, this may bring you some feelings of nostalgia, as you ponder over the possible messages of this movie, and how things have changed since those possibly carefree days.By today's modern animation standards, the hand-drawn animation in this movie might be considered crude or rough. The style of animation seems to be deliberate, and even seems to bring a little more life to the story.I'd also say that in today's 'touchy-feely' society, this movie might not be considered appropriate for children under the ages of 10.If I have a single complaint about this DVD, it's with the sound production. The audio track is extremely poor quality. I had to max the volume, and even ended up turning on sub-titles."
3,A FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE FOR ME AS A CHILD,OK I SAW THIS MOVIE WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG. I HAD NO IDEA IT WAS SO INTENSE. THE FIRST THING IN THE MOVIE THAT SCARED ME WAS WHEN ONE OF THE RABBITS SAW BLOOD COMING TO THEM ALL OVER THE SKY (OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.) I KEPT ON WATCHING STILL THINKING IT WAS GOING TO BE A NICE MOVIE. NEAR THE END THE MOVIE HAD SOME HORRIBLE SCENES WITH BUNNIES AND DOGS TEARING BUNNIES APART. AFTER A FEW YEARS HAD PASSED I HAD COME TO UNDERSTAND THE MOVIE AND ACCEPT IT'S CONTENTS. OVERALL IT IS PROBABLY A GOOD MOVIE BUT I THINK I SHOULD HAVE WATCHED IT A COUPLE YEARS LATER.
1,worst insurance you can get,dont waste your money the people at this company dont give a crap.my phone was stolen and there like oh well it sucks to be you.ive had plenty of phones before and used other insurance companies that had no problem replacing a lost or stolen phone as long as you pay the co-pay.not apple though.im sure it was in the contract when i got the plan so its my fault as well but ive never dealt with an insurance company that didn't cover lost or stolen phones especially when you pay the money you pay to get this insurance.It's no wonder they have you pay the whole year or two up front.
5,The best book for Graph Theory,"I am very much interested in Graph Theory, but I tried a lot to find the right book. Fortunately, I got this book and is amazing. It covers a wide range of concepts with the clear explanations and examples. The best method to use this book is read line by line and don't proceed further if you stuck on a particular concept. Solve all the exercise problems of each section before moving to the next one.----------------------------------Quality of the book - excellentcovers wide range of conceptsexcellent examples and very good explanations---------------------------------------------Good Luck!Reddy"
5,Who wrote the product description?,"It consists of 5 packages of fish, a can of pate and some crackers. I bought mine for about $26 and not the current price. The metal basket is cheap tin and the decorations fall off. I didn't buy it for the basket so no big deal."
5,Fascinating!,If only every government official would come clean like this. A fascinating insight into McNamara and the Vietnam War. Engrossing.
4,Historical,"This book has the feel of a man pooring out his soul. He told the truth as he saw it and I saw no reason to find fault with his history. To get a good feel for the book go to Charlie Rose archives and watch his interview with McNamara and the producer of his documentary.One thing that will upset many people is to see how McNamara changed over the years but then refused to speak up when he believed the Iraq War was wrong. He knows the war was built on lies but still refused to speak out. That seems to me to mitigate the pooring out his soul for VietNam.I would hope that the brainiacs like McNamara, et al, would somehow try to protect the American people but that does not seem to be the case. Such it is with politics.Rick Clark[...]"
2,"52,000 Lives Too Late","Mr. McNamara finally accepts responsibility for the political rationale of the Vietnam deception. However, the book is a poorly written attempt to rationalize the blood of 52,000 brave Americans that will be his final legacy."
1,Oh No,"It wasn't that great. It's a waste of time, really. I love the band and all, but... don't waste the money, it's REALLY not worth it. At all. End of story."
2,Disappointed,"I read MOST of this, paged through MUCH of it. I chose it because it was included in the list of Joanne Fluke's works. I expected the publisher to include similar works when they included the other authors works with JF's. I was uncomfortably mistaken. I did enjoy some of the stories.By now you may realize I don't like much of what's offered on TV or in Movies. I'm a strange old ""flower child""; I appreciate a good mystery, and feel that the addition of TMI in romantic subplots is only included to cover up the for the lack of substance in the mystery."
2,Fern Michaels' contributions ruined the book for me,"I just got my Kindle and wanted some light reading so I ordered several Christmas romance collections. Fern Michaels is a name I recognized and so I thought I couldn't go wrong. Well, I guess I could. The woman simply cannot write dialog at all! She has her characters jumping from subject to subject without even taking a breath. Who in real life talks like that?! For crying out loud, she doesn't even start a new paragraph to give her readers some idea that her characters have moved on to a different topic. Several times, I found myself checking to see if I had skipped a page because I couldn't take the leaps of logic that her characters were. The overall affect is that I didn't connect with her characters or her writing and simply found myself irritated with the whole story.Overall, the whole book was a disappointment and a waste of $5.00. I will never pick up another Fern Michaels book!"
1,Timekillers from Space,"When I was a kid, this movie seemed to crop up at least once a month, and signalled (to me) it was time to go outside and play, no matter what time of day. Peter Graves is a scientist who dies in a plane crash but is resurrected by aliens who talk backwards and have ping-pong balls for eyes. Seems they want him to steal atomic secrets so they can grow more giant insects. Or something. Graves spends most of the picture either running through the same cave set or wearing a bathrobe and trying to convince people he's not nuts. Not bad enough to be good; just bad enough to be horribly dull."
5,Typical Debo,"This book is so typical of Angie Debo, well written, factual, and so full of feeling for the subject, that one often feels you are taking part in the events descibed in the book.A very useful ""general history"" of Native Americans"
5,The Littles is the best!!,"Hi my name is Jorai; I just read The Littles. This is my favorite book in the whole world. I like the part where the Littles try and tame the cat when Tom says ""here kitty, kitty."" The cat goes over to Tom. Tom pets her and she starts to purr. I recommend this to elementary students."
2,Not worth it,"This is the second CD I bought to have my baby listen to something Italian (since I am Italian) but again I was disappointed because the songs are translation of American ones and they do not really work in Italian... they do not rhyme and even the sounds of things are wrong!!! I do not know who did this CD, certainly not Italians who live or have lived there recentely!!! Absolutely not worth it!!! Not the music I want my baby to listen to!!!"
3,Runs small,"I order the appropriate size according to the fit guide, and while the tights did fit, they were tight. Otherwise these tights were fine for my Halloween costume."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT. I BOUGHT A 42"" MONITOR THAT I WANTED TO HANG ON THE WALL. WHEN I GOT THIS I WASN'T SURE WHAT I WAS GETTING!! IT ARRIVED QUICKLY & WELL PACKAGED. IT IS VERY WELL MADE. IT WAS VERY EASY TO INSTALL. WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT?"
4,Very Pleased,"The wall mount arrived quickly and was easy to installed. I was able to mount my Sharp 52"" LCD in approximately 30 minutes. Purchasing online via Amazon saved me more than $60 over a purchase at the local electronics outlet."
3,It's like preaching to the choir.,"It's not terribly fanciful and the illustrations are dull. I love the idea--like if I met a parent who had no idea how to get her kids to sleep, or I met one whom I suspected was a closet family-bedder, or if I wanted a gift for a new parent---just to let them know that people do this, happily.But the story is dry and the pictures look like they came from a textbook. It feels more like propaganda than entertainment. I am glad I have it, but I was disappointed, as you can tell. The people who would buy this book would usually be people who are cuddlers themselves, and I bet most of them already have much cuter stories to tell about sleeping in one bed together!"
5,Very Entertaining,"I read this book after all the controversy with the author, James Frey. This book is absolutely entertaining from start to finish. Anyone who loved ""A Million Little Pieces"" and doesn't care if the author embellished, will love ""My Friend Leonard"".Good book by a good writer. Can't wait for more books from James Frey (if there will be any)."
4,"It's good, It's good.","If you understand that this book is part fiction, with some reality and just take it for what it is you might enjoy it. You might enjoy it. ;)"
4,I KNOW THIS GUY!!,"The majority of my reading is confined to non-fiction. BUT,I was told about this book by my daughter, who was sure I would enjoy it.I quickly ""recognized"" Leonard as an individual I knew and respected.He was, an ""important"" figure in a certain period of my life in the 70's.I not only related to this book, I REALLY enjoyed it. It was so VERY on target with the individual I knew and respected. I was astonished at the similarities.Great!!"
4,nice a friend like this,"The book is very good written and read, and I also would have a friend like Leonard, he is very good."
5,Frey is amazing!!!!,"After reading ""A Million Little Pieces"", I was left wanting more. I went right out and bought this book. It was uplifting to see Frey's life move forward, and to see him happy! He is an amazing author and this book is a MUST read!"
5,a great follow up...better than the first book Million...........,"I was skeptical reading these books....while I wished he had not lied because it's hard to see some of the beauty knowing it's a lie.....he can still write. Yes I think he has a duty to be honest since it's a non-fiction. It's disappointing. However, it's not more disappointing than news media which says it's unbiased and is. No more disappointing than college professors which try to sway young minds....James Frey is a genuis. A hell of a writer! And I enjoyed these books, was inspired and got a good message from them. True or not the story is great and hopefully will help people through a hard time."
4,Good book of fiction and if real GREAT book!,"This book was as good as ""Million Little Pieces"" and I really liked the book; the only question is ""How much of the book is real and how much is fiction?"""
1,awkward,I found it an awkward read which made it difficult to relate to the story and the emotional content - this is a shame. A lot of the book read as though the author was desperately trying to create an edgy writing/sentence structure. My friend leonard is often stilted and moves with far too many one and two word sentences for my liking - far too 'clever'. Not the right read for someone who likes to find images in a more straight forward novel style.
2,Mind Numbingly Dull,I picked up the book. I opened. I read. I read more. I yawned. I dozed. I woke. I read some more. I cried. As I read the book I cried. Why did he write another? Why did he have to prove he was a one shot wonder with only this tiny bit of style? Son. My Son. Why? I feel the urge. To destroy. To hurt as I have been hurt. To rip into little bits of paper. To get a refund. I step outside. The sun is warm. I open the pail. I throw in the book. I laugh. Better. Much better. Much much better. Much much much better. Son. My son.
4,i loved this book!,"fiction or non, great addition to the million little pieces book. really shows more into his relationship with leonard. i cant remember all the details as it has been quite a while since i actually read it and this review. i would recommend if you liked a million little pieces."
5,Love the sequel to Million Little Pieces!!,"If you read A Million Little Pieces and then wondered what became of everyone, this is a great book. I finished A Million Little Pieces a few days before all the controversey broke. I still think its an excellent book and I love the way he writes. I really enjoyed My Friend Leonard and could care less how much is true and how much is totally made up. Its a BOOK and I read it for entertainment. It was very entertaining and I hope to see more from Mr. Frey."
4,"""Leonard"" continues the saga . . .","After reading ""A Million Little Pieces,"" I immediately bought ""My Friend Leonard."" Whether or not these stories are literally true in every aspect, there is no question that they are largely autobiographical and completely fascinating. James Frey may not be writing great literature, but he sure knows how to tell as story that is absorbing, entertaining, and informative. Oprah totally missed the point and did this man a great disservice by jeopardizing his sobriety to titillate her audience. Oprah knows nothing (apparently) about addiction. James Frey knows a lot."
5,Emotions,"In my opinion, any book or movie that stirs emotions the way ""my Friend Leonard"" did - deserves credit. If a book stirs emotions or reactions - laughter or tears - it's worth the money spent. I truly enjoyed ""leonard"" - can't wait for Frey's next book."
2,My Friend Leonard,Once I found out it was all a lie it took away the realism for me. It was suppose to be a memoir which it really wasn't.
4,Best ever,Better then the first. I love the way he makes the words flow together. The stream of consciousness is perfect.
4,Addictive Read...,"After finishing Frey's first memoir, ""A Million Little Pieces"", I was left wanting more. ""My Friend Leonard"" was the perfect follow-up to Frey's adventures and struggles with addiction, communication, love, and family relations. In the first memoir, Leonard was a dynamic character who was full of surprises for those around him. When I learned that the sequel's title was primarily about Frey's relationship with his mentor, I knew that it would be entertaining read. I wasn't expecting the heart-wrenching fate of Lily nor the final plights of Leonard. I felt as if I knew these characters personally so I grieved right along with Frey. The raw human emotion made this story worth reading and also made this book hard for me to put down, I easily finished it in a few hours. Whether it was a book of ""extended truths"" or Frey's real-life experiences, ""My Friend Leonard"" was a powerful and addictive read."
1,I will not read this book.,"I purchased this book before I knew that James Frey lied in his memoir. I choose not to read this book on principal. I would return this book for a refund if I could. I read a borrowed copy of ""A Million Little Pieces"", otherwise, I would return that one for a refund."
5,emotional overload!...............,"First of all, I could care less about the ""embelishment scandal"", I LOVE this book as well as ""A Million Little Pieces"". I really enjoy James Frey's writing style and I found myself becoming emotionally attatched to particular people in the book. Whether Leonard is a real person or fictional, I have never felt SO EMOTIONAL after I read a book as I did with this one. I laughed and cried through this whole book and my first thought after the last page was that I can't wait to read the next book by James Frey. If you want to actually FEEL and LIVE every word in a book, ""My Friend Leonard"" is definately worth the read."
1,pathetic,"Don`t waste your time. Even if this were a true story, I still wouldn`t recommend it. His writing style is so far over the top, it reads like a grade ""B"" Hollywood film. However, if you like a mediocre story, and don`t mind picking your way through more tired old cliches than an Ed Wood horror flick, this might be the book for you."
5,"""My Friend Leonard""","Every generation produces a few writers who leave their imprint on their readers forever. ""My Friend Leonard"" is an unforgettable book that will haunt your heart, as only the best writers can....Intensely wise and beautifully written. ""My Friend Leonard"" is a heartbreaking page-turner. I envy the reader who is about to jump into the world of James Frey for the first time."
1,fraud,"I strongly suspected ""A Million Little Pieces"" didn't ring true & this book is simply an extension of the fraud. Frey should be ashamed of himself."
4,Better then Pieces,"I was reading A Million Little Pieces when the whole ""scandal"" broke out about it not being truthful. I did not love A Million Little Pieces, but since I live in Chicago, I decided to read My Friend Leonard. I am glad I did. Going into it, you already know it is not true (it starts out with him in jail), but it is a really good read. I liked the way it was written and I was drawn into the story. I highly recommend this book..but just know going into it that it is fiction."
3,hard to move,Sturdy and well made but hard to move on unpolished but smooth concrete floor.Unless you have super smooth epoxy floors this is really a 2 man job.
5,Savage Eden,I have been a fan of Cassie Edwards for years. I am retired and read 2 books a week. This book as well as her others are good reading. I am Native and relate to and learn history of different tribes. Keep writing Cassie and Amazon keep sending the great offers you offer. Thanks Sallye Meeks
1,what a terrible film.,"God, this movie was terrible. I was dying to watch it because it was filmed in my hometown...Pittsgrove, NJ. But the film was just bad. The plot was stupid, the dialogue was stupid, which made it slightly entertaining, in a ""this movie sucks so much it's funny"" Lifetime-movie kind of way. No wonder it didn't put us on the map!"
1,This book is hopeless,"This book gives NO information on Index Server. After reading this book, you may know how to master a Internet Information Server but there is NO WAY you will pass the 70-077 Exam !! Try to study the online documentation and leave this book alone."
3,"It's pretty funny, but.....","Overall, pretty Funny, with all the stuff you can't see on TV. My one problem with it is that it depends a bit too much on A: Animals having sex, and B:laughs involving different bodily functions and excretions. Overall, though, worth seeing just for the ""Stupid human"" stuff."
1,line 6 horrible,"I can't say anything good about line 6. Ever amp I have used from them has an issue, I wish they would just recall it already. Stupid phaser and echo issue is blowing up all over the internet. How in the hell are they still selling this junk? You reset it, it goes back to the way it was. Do not buy anything from them, buy a Marshal, Crate, Peavey anything is better than this."
5,awesome collectible,"i have this optimus prime, best one so far, keepin it in box, this toy is an exclusive to only target stores, i paid 19.99 for it, sold at target only , to much on amazon, dont spend 40.00, i suggest goin to target and payin 20."
1,"beware of misleading and overpaying, it is not worth!","someone is asking USD 100 for this CD which is available for an normal price under the name ""IN CONCERT"" (same cover, same tracklist) and furthermore it does NOT contain the live recording of the famous Royal Albert Hall concert in 1969 of 1970, I am not sure when that happened, all four member were present, before the Pendulum-album was released. I doubt whether those recordings still exist after four decades and numerous compilations of the band or combined with solowork from John Fogerty. Anyway, THIS album came out on vinyl under the title as mentioned on the cover but actually is far from Londen performed and recorded: in Oakland, California, later hastily retitled ""In Concert"". No reason though to pay a ridiculous amount of money."
5,"""depeche mode remixes 81....04"" is depeche mode cool !!!","This set is fantastic! Can't stop listening! 95% of content is something I never heard before, and I thought I've heard it all.CD#3 totally kicks ass!!! I really like that remixes are not positioned earliest->latest, but rather mixed together. The quality of recorded sound is spectacular! The design of the set is outstanding, box is properly sturdy and I like it shiny like that, too. Slip is a good idea . Yellow, blue, pink CDs and sleves- cool! The set gives you a 4 hour non-stop parteeeeey."
2,What happens when you can't write anymore? REMIX ALBUM,"Sadly, most remixes today are nothing but sheer overkill, resembling NOTHING like the original cut mix. But then that's the point isn't it? Back in the 80's extended versions of many songs were creatively lengthened into more of the same song - not some bombastic piece rendered unrecognizable. Usually it was the producer of the original album who would handle longer versions, but for the longest time now, it's contracted out to people who just want to make a name for themselves and FAILING to improve the original work. Sad. You can see it happening with cutout bin destined works recently by Dave Gahan and Martin Gore. Maybe they should make one last stab and do a Duran Duran by reforming the original 4. Hell, bring in Vince Clarke and Alison Moyet while you're at it."
3,REALLY DISSAPOINTED,"I HAVE TO SAY THAT WHEN I HEARD A REMIX ALBUM WOULD BE COMING OUT, I WAS EXCITED. I THOUGHT THAT THE SONGS WOULD BE GIVEN UPDATED MIXES. MOST OF THESE REMIXES ARE FROM THE ORIGINAL MAXI SINGLE RELEASE. AND SOME ARE OK, BUT THE UPDATED MIXES ARE HORRENDOUS. I'M SORRY, BUT DEPECHE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AHEAD OF THEIR GAME, ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR REMIXES FROM LATE 80'S TO MID NINETY'S. BUT I FEEL THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN TWO STEPS BACK WITH THIS RELEASE. DID THEY APPROVE THIS OR WAS IT A RECORD LABEL THING? IF YOU OWN THE MAXI SINGLES, KEEP THEM AND STAY AWAY FROM THIS RELEASE. THOSE REMIXES WERE MUCH BETTER."
3,A little too much hype...,"Frankly, I was very excited about the release. When the boxset finally arrived, I was disappointed with the cheap packaging. The cardboards that house the CDs are, well, very flimsy. Packaging overall could have done better.I am more of a newOrder, Pet Shop Boys fan than DM. Trying not to be too biased here but I think DM remixes are not as hyped up to be. There are a few good remixes on the 3 discs. Majority on Disc 3 are good. I skipped most of the mixes on the first two discs. Being a Timo Maas fan, I can't believe they put his mix on the CD. Horrible mix. Cicada mix of World in My Eyes should be there instead.It's ok to have not a must have compilation of remixes."
3,No DVI inputs,LCDs look best when used with DVI. This doesn't have it. And you better make sure your video card has a DVI output if you want to go that route.
1,dorond review,THIS PRODUCT DID NOT HELP MY CALPHLON COOKWARE AT ALL. I FIND IT USELESS. DO NOT BOTHER TO BUY.
4,A keeper,"I just wish they'd have kept the packaging the same as the original four seasons with the plastic box over the cardboard foldout packaging. I've purchased each season individually over the years, as I know waiting for the entire series in a box set would work my patience as well as my wallet."
5,Lost Season #5,These DVDs were delivered in a timely fashion. The quality is excellent. The storage box is nice too.
1,Rating DVD's not the content. They didn't work,"DVD's all had a weird glue residue on them that at first looked like scratched. Royal pain washing them off. After a few attempts, I still had stuttering going on during playback. Cheap packaging and merchandising of good content. But really, DVD quality, isn't that what separates it from watching the show on tv?"
1,Lost Season 5 Review,"I purchased this for my father for Christmas. I did not open the package before giving it to him; lesson learned. The DVD's were open and scratched. They were in such bad shape that he couldn't watch the first two. He went out and purchased the product again at a retail store. I then contacted who I purchased the product from and never heard anything back from them. I requested a new set, but nothing. Horrible vendor."
4,Missing Bonus Features,"I am going to make this short and sweet. I thought that the DVDs for the Fifth season were put together very well(i.e. the episodes and all the bonus features). I only had maybe a couple of issues with it. First, why is it that they have stopped putting the liners notes with the indepth episode synopsis. With the fourth season and now the fifth season they just provide a list of the season's episodes. Second, there seems to be a couple of bonus features missing. In the product description here on Amazon.com, it says that among the bonus features is ""A day with Josh Holloway"" and a behind the scenes of the 100th episode celebration. I looked everywhere in the DVD's bonus features and I couldn't find either of these. Am I the only one?"
4,Excellent disc quality,I pre-ordered this months ago and while watching the show I had to check the box and see if I ordered blu-ray...which I didn't. I thought I did cos the quality is excellent.Wish there was a booklet inside explaining about each episode. For this money there should be something.Personally I love the relationship between Sawyer and Juliette. Sawyer really does seem different by not pissing people off all the time and not so self centered. It is like this relationship changed him. God I love this show.
5,LOST season 5,The Lost season 5 box set came quickly and was in excellent shape. We have had no problems with any of the disks.
3,Lost,"I loved this series when it first started on tv. Then they started with the reruns, jumping all over the place and like a lot of people I then really got LOST and lost interest. I have purchased all of the seasons to date and will get the ones to come. One of these days I will watch them in succession and hope to enjoy them once more."
3,Bare Bones content.,What has happened to the Blu-Ray releases of Lost? When Season 3 first came out on Blu-Ray it came in a great box. Inside the box was the actual plastic case that held the discs. Inside of the case was a insert that told the name of the episodes and which disc they were on. As a matter of fact every release of Lost either on DVD or Blu-Ray has had the inserts in them. Well guess what Season 5 has. It has 2 inserts of which both are advertisements. Why not have a insert with the episode listings? I paid $60 for this and it is just a bare bones version. The show is great. But this regular Blu-Ray version sucks.
1,"COMES OUT in DECEMBER, should disable rating until then","There are blogs and forums to review shows, this is a product review not a show review FAIL. There are spammers on here who do get paid to write some of those ridiculously long epic reviews of how great something is before it gets released ( You know who you are). People pull this same craaap with video games and books. key words PRODUCT REVIEW not show review."
3,Not as great as I was lead to believe,"I understand that this was a landmark film for the AA community. I get it. And yes, Dandridge is a pretty woman, but I have to be honest and say I wasn't wowed by her performance-or with Harry Belafonte. Pearl Bailey, however, knew how to work the camera. But my main beef with this film is the music. It doesn't fit this backdrop or these characters. I understand it's an adapted Opera-but honestly, these characters look silly to me singing (or lip-synching) these songs. They're singing opera but saying things like ""Dat-Dem-De-Knowed"" WTF? Sorry. I'm just not that impressed. But given the landmark status this film has acquired, I guess it's still worth a peek."
2,"CARMEN JONES, NOTHING BUT A MOVIE TITLE TO ME.","I WASN'T TOO IMPRESSED WITH THIS ONE. MS. DANDRIDGE REMINDED ME OF A CHICKENHEAD FROM THE PROJECTS; RIGHT FROM THE START. HARRY BELAFONTE WAS COOL, BUT A LITTLE SQUARE. PEARL BAILEY COULD HAVE CUT LOOSE A LITTLE MORE, I KNOW SHE WANTED TOO. EVERYONE APPEARED TO BE STIFF IN THIS MOVIE, IT WAS A BIT DEPRESSING. THE ONE KIND OF MUSIC THAT I'M NOT TOO CRAZY OVER, IS OPRA. ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE OF THE BLUES AND JAZZ ERA, TRIES TO SING OPRA. IT JUST DOESN'T FIT."
3,"Great songs, but .....","This film version of CARMEN JONES is a textbook example of why a first-rate stage musical usually does not make a first-rate movie. The cast is mostly excellent (especially Dorothy Dandridge), Oscar Hammerstein's lyrics are among his best, and the basic idea of adapting Bizet's music into a World War 2 setting with an all-Black cast, while retaining the same overall storyline, remains ingenious. But the film lacks the impact which the stage version (according to many first-hand accounts) had. One example of a mistake made in the film version is that the thrilling climax in which Carmen is murdered takes place in a broom closet."
3,watch for Dorothy and songs,"Dorothy Dandridge is very good in this, but the rest of the cast (apart from Pearl Baily) seems lethargic in comparison. This is at least partly a result of the strangely static direction. Most of the dance/song sequences are in mediumshot with little or no cutting at all. Since the choreography is relatively static, this style tends to grind things almost to a halt. Most folks will find themselves really itching for some closeups, especially of the glowing Dandridge. She really is a joy to watch and and Harry Belafonte, though no great actor, is charming."
2,Poor Phanfiction at best....,"I truly did not care for this version of the retelling/spin-off story of The Phantom of the Opera. You can read better fanfiction on-line...and for FREE! I found many of the situations between Erik and Christine unbelievable at best...and at worst, just plain laughable!!! I just couldn't see Erik doing some of the things he did...it all just seemed so out of character. Running off to America, finding themselves in Louisiana...the wedding night problems, the black magic/voodoo stuff thrown in...It was all so painful just to get through this book. If you must have this book to complete your ""Phantom Library"" by all means, please buy this book used. Do not pay full price and if you MUST read it....read it with a grain of salt. It is not the best Phantom fiction to be had.Instead of this book, please try:The Phantom of the Opera by Gaston Leroux (Lowell Bair translation)Phantom by Susan KayAngel of the Opera by Sam SicilianoProgeny by Becky Meadows"
3,It was alright ...,"It was an okay book and was enjoyable for the most part,but it could have been a tad bit better. I bought it cause I'm a HUGE phantom phan."
4,Not Bad Phan-fic,"I am a huge Phantom phan and I breezed through this book in about 2 days. It's an interesting theory on what may have happened if Erik had left the Opera. Christine's total acceptance of him kidnapping her to America was a little far-fetched, but the author did a good job of expressing their budding romance as well as Erik's change from a ""monster"" to a human being.The story is told in Erik's point of view, but you can totally tell a chic wrote the book. Also, the ending reminds me of the movie Mr. Holland's Opus.Bitter sweet, but enjoyable. Nice to finally read a Phantom book where Christine doesn't die in the end."
3,Good,"The first half of the book is beautifully written. It sweeps you up in a torrent of emotion. The second half is interesting and heartbreaking at the same time. The end leaves something to be desired, but it doesn't take away from the beauty of the story. This is a story for anyone who loves Phantom of the Opera."
1,Razac,"This product wasnt that helpful to my hair.. I didnt really see a difference, plus it made my hair extremely greasy and weigh it down. Im African American with type 4a relaxed hair, this product just wasnt my cup of tea"

4,Rock & Roll Done Right,"As someone who played in Rock bands for more years than I want to admit,I raise my half-price beer to this movie. This is the only movie about a rock band that gets it right, and drives a stake into all of the vapid, overnight sensation Eddy-and-the-Cruisers flops. Incidently, this is an engaging film even if you don't care about Rock & Roll. Funny, frustrating and real - check it out.Thank you! Goodnight!"
4,Slick Slick Slick ;-),"For this review, bottom line, it is a reasonable cost and does what it supposed to do ... it works. Works perfectly with my Yamaha XM Ready receiver. Techno gadgets are cool - tuning in XM stations on my receiver rates up there in ""cool category"". It is fun. ;-)"
4,Jessel Lo- Jackie Chan fan,Terrific. The only thing that would have made it better if Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao were in it like the first one
3,What Can I Say?,"I got this Power Door Lock Actuator for a better price on-line than at my local auto parts store. The drawback was I had to wait for it to be shipped, but the much better price made up for it. The actuator was the right one for my application, but I had to do slight modifactions in order to make it work right. The actuator came with a weatherproof protected boot, which I liked, that was not on the OEM actuator. I now have working power door locks again."
5,One man's struggles...,"Jack London is America's best adventure novel writer because he lived the lives of those he wrote about, and, back when life was hard. London was a man's man. This book is about his struggle with alcohol which he lost (just like Hemingway). Great read and well worth it!"
4,A Treasure,"Dated melodrama, but wonderful. Shirley MacLaine's become such a cliche of herself that it can be dificult to remember how good she used to be. And, of course, Anne Bancroft is outstanding. Then there's the dancing and the music. And Baryshnikov. Just watch him hang in the air in ""Le Corsaire"". Glorious"
1,dvd broke,dvd didn't work -- sent back heard nothing---had picture no sound reordered a vcr tape- it works fine - movie is excellant
5,HILARITY AT ITS GREATEST!!!!!,"This movie is charming and witty. Anytime you're down in the dumps, pop in this movie and laugh out loud. This movie is what got me interested in Zorro. A true comedic masterpiece!"
5,A funny parody of Zorro,"George Hamilton made two comedies in the 80s that people still remember. ""Love at First Bite"" and ""Zorro the Gay Blade"". Of the two, I think this one has aged the best.Much of the spoof seems to be directed towards the 1974 TV production of ""The Mark of Zorro"" with Frank Langella and Ricardo Montalbon. (It is not in print, but has shown up on cable from time to time.)What I find interesting is that when the Mask of Zorro came out in 1998, just about every Zorro film was available *except* this one. I guess they did not want people reminded of some of the better lines during their version of Zorro.""Two bits, four bits, six bits, a peso. All for Zorro stand up and say so!""If you enjoy Zorro films and are willing to see fun poked at your hero, see this film. It is funny, enjoyable and quite memorable. See it before ""The Legend of Zorro"" comes out in October 2005."
5,Always amusing & slightly twisted,"We wore out our first copy of this movie; even 88-yr-old Grandma enjoys this one! Lively fun for the whole family, if your's is as twisted as mine...how ""twisted""? My son dressed as Dr. Frank N. Furter for a haunted house, and I did his hair and make-up.Hope you enjoy this movie as much as we have over the years."
4,Unique...,"There's some disturbing images in this film depending on where you're coming from, but an interesting and poignant film, nonetheless."
5,Best CD I have,I first heard the Beu Sisters as the opening act for Clay Aiken and Kelly Clarkson's Independent Tour. They were great. Bought the CD and have been listening to them non-stop since March.
3,Didn't learn much from this,"I have only played in one 10 week season but what I will say was lacking in this was more learning tools for beginners. The commentary tracks seem to be narrated by a clique who seem to make a few too many ""inside"" references for a newbie to relate to. I paraphrase but pointing out a girl in an action sequence and saying ""I love her"" really doesn't help me relate. I do get from this that the players are a strong knit community.The action footage I would have liked to have seen was more of stack formations. Too often we don't see what the thrower sees downfield. For someone like me who is trying to learn how to run good routes, this DVD didn't help much.There is a nice instructional DVD sold with a disc in most sporting goods chains. The name escapes me."
3,Disappointing,"The idea was good.The artwork is often good, sometimes superb.Unfortunately the twit who put this together obviously thought that the massive borders around the selected text was more important than the pictures themselves.I bought this book for the pictures, that what it is all about, one would think. For a book like this I want to see the best pictures, as large as possible, with the best colour on good paper.Unfortunately, the largest pictures only occupy one side of a page. There is only one double page spread, instead of many. The bad news is that most pictures don't even fill a single page. Sadly there are many superb paintings in landscape mode that fill less than half of one page. Even portrait mode pictures are often left with a large surrounding of white space.Also the colour isn't of the very best quality.This is just not good enough Harper Collins. I hope the editor was sacked. Pictures this good should be treated with respect."
5,Highly recommended!,"If you are an Eliane Elias fan, this recording should meet your expectations. The song ""Kissed By Nature"" is a beautiful composition, with a romantic, bossa nova flavor. It's 'soul soothing' and has a nice melody..Eliane really hit it out of the park, with this recording. She can write songs, sing and play piano-all with outstanding proficiency."
3,Fast Read,"This is a book you could finish in 2 or so days. It wasnt as filling as I wanted it to be, but if you're interested in The Ford presidentcy this is the place to start."
2,The author doesn't give the readers enough credit.,"Not worth the time...Silly dialogue. It seems like a teenager tried to fantasize what a relationship might be like once you have a profession. Too much talk about getting heated, wanting one another, misunderstanding one another. Definitely not worth the money. Very dumbed down. The author needs to give the reader's more credit."
4,Slumberjack Telluride,"This was the first new and improved, highly compressible sleeping bags that I've purchased. Gone are the days for me to lug around a sleeping bag the size of a large carry-on. Although I now own and use the Big Agnes Encampment, I didn't have any issues with the Slumberjack Telluride when I did use it. It packs small with the included compression sack and is very roomy and warm at tempuratures above 35 as long as you use a good pad or cot below you and you are not a cold sleeper. The material is smooth and comfy and for me the zippers worked. Although I do admit that I rarely use them. I simply work my way into the bag as though putting on a pair of socks. Anyway, I do recommend this bag for those that don't camp that often, are on a budget, have the patience to not force the zippers or just want to have a good sleeping bag around without taking out a second mortgage."
5,Why...?,"Why can't some smart record executive purchase the master tapes not only to this fantastic album but all other albums released on the old LIGHT label and reissue them? There is a gold mine there, as evidenced by the fact that the CD's sell for $50-plus. If you can find them.....(**UPDATE** As of this morning, 22 June, 2012, there is a used copy of this CD available (*used*, not even NOS) listed for $99. Come on, someone!!! Re-released the old Light catalogue)"
4,Multi use,I have used these as my swim suit rather than a brief: the material is thick enough to use as a swim suit. Give it a try.
1,WORST DVD I HAVE EVER BOUGHT,"I bought volumes 1 and 2 at the same time and I feel cheated out of my hard-earned money. These are two of the worst purchases I have made EVER!!! Most of the songs are song by people who would have a hard time getting gigs at Holiday Inn lounges. The videos themselves have nothing to do with the lyrics of the songs since the director thinks that all of of the songs can be summarized visually as ""bimbos in cheap bikinis (or other forms of revealing clothing bought at K-Mart). Not that the director could have done much with the actors. The girls look like strippers at a low-class country strip clubs and have the same level of acting ability. The guys look like Sears catalogue models who are either semi-nude or are wearing tacky and cheap cloths and they have the same dopey ""I am posing for the underwear shoot"" expression no matter what they are supposed to be doing in the video. You will be terribly disappointed if you buy these terrible DVDs."
4,Solid State unleashes real metal...,"The newest release from a label that's been putting out some pretty devastating cds as of late. Solid State records has just been off the wall with these great cds lately, it's like they are a gold mine for these great bands and records and this one is totally one of them! This cd is pretty heavy. I would def describe it as Meshuggah meets Sepultura and Slayer and then yells at them, a lot! This one is also a step up from the last cd, which was great on it's own. The cd has a lot of variation between the song styles, like one would be pretty deathy then going to a very 'metal' part, and then just when you think it's not gonna be there, the melodic parts come in to play. This one is off the charts, check out ""subtille Alliance"" and ""Separation"".This cd is just another reason to check out Solid State, with bands like ZAO, Norma Jean, Eso Charis, and more, how can you go wrong?"
3,Journey of Self Awarness,"Pushkin and The Queen of Spades is about an African-American woman who finds out that her son is engaged to be married to a white, Russian lap dancer,named Tanya. She is not to thrilled about this. She thinks it is because Tanya is black and that it is a reflection on how he feel about her. But, as the story goes along, she finds that this is not the case. On the contrary, she finds that the very qualities her son, Pushkin, admires in his fiance, Tanya, are some of the same that his mother possesses. The story is Windsor's journey of finding this out and therefore, how she changes her attitude toward Tanya, from loathing to love.Moreover, the book deal with the self-hatred that some African Americans feel toward themselves, when they measure their worth against the worth of other. Particulary, white people. In this case, the worth of white women compared with Black women."
2,Hey it's Arnold...,"what can I say about this movie....well it was early schwarzenneger, lots of action, hammy dialogue, typical one-liners, but hey it's ARNOLD! If you're an avid Arnold fan and must have every movie made by the governator, get it, but it's not one of his better movies."
1,LEAKS LIKE A SIEVE,"I don't know about the quality of the ingredients proper in the gel-cap, but I can attest to the fact that, out of three bottles, each and every one of them had leaking pills in it. This clingy, orange stuff sticks to everything. If this is the quality control of this company, I wonder what's in the pill."
4,Lawless,LawlessShia LaBeoufIt was a good movie but I felt that there was not enough action. I still give it four stars.
4,Great movie...,"Loved the movie. I liked the subject matter,time setting and the music. Both Tom Hardy and Shia LaBeouf did good jobs in their roles."
3,Lawless indeed!,"I liked the idea for the movie. I would imagine it pretty close to how those Chicago boystried to do business back in the day. The characters in the story were hardcore for sure.Could have done without the heart felt, boy girl crap. Wasted to much time that couldhave been used for more shoot outs and ass whippings. The character that Shia Labeoufplayed should have been dropped from the whole movie. No entertaining reason for thecharacter at all. Real cry baby. I got real tired of the back and forth between him and his girl friend.The two older brothers were what needed to have more time in the movie. If the movie hadhad more grit from the two older brothers and less whining from Labeouf's character I would have givenit a much higher score."
1,Worst movie ever,Title says it all do not waste your money on this crap. It is a slow moving movie with nothing worth waiting for no climax at all. Just bad then bad with an ending of bad
1,lawless,"too much bad language and ugly and dark content, waiting for some more family oriented movies for our family to watch"
1,Bore and gore,Not a very deep plot. Nothing but one boring scene after another just to get to the next scene of over the top gore and gratuitous violence. Some people might think the tough guy posturing by the actors was cool but I was not impressed.
4,Good,Never a dull moment. Good insight to what running moon shine was like back in those days. I would recommend it.
2,Glad I only rented it,"The only thing holding this movie together is the acting. Otherwise, the story is absolutely predictable, the incorporation of two love stories brings the flow of the movie to several sudden stops, and frankly, a few of the director's choices are better suited for a B horror film."
3,"Good, but violent","Good movie, but very violent. We found the dialog hard to hear and understand. The background music was plenty loud, of course."
3,"Well done movie, very grim and violent","This movie was extremely well acted and directed. Everything about it was well done. The story was good. But, it was extraordinarily violent. I'm not turned off by violence, or even very sensitive to violence, so I tend not to take warnings of violence too seriously. The end was depressing."
3,Great Story,"Way to much bad language, surely we as a nation can talk without cursing every other breath, enjoyed the story, of the time in history"
4,Lawless,Great movie! Just seemed 2 fast forward a lot and keep you guessing Didn't get the part when Jack left the church with one shoe then is getting beaten while wearing 2 shoes then his brother gives his missing shoe back. Also a lot of parts in the movie in explained like it was quickly edited so they can release it could've been longer with more character story lines leaves it up to the viewer to decipher. But overall a great story Shia is a great actor and I would recommend this movie and give it 4 stars. Must see it on bluray for all the extras and deleted scenes if they have em :)
1,slow moving,This was slow moving and depressing. There was a lot of physical violence. No one in my family liked it.
3,just OK,a little slow to develop and and just an OK movie. Some parts were hard to understand at times also
4,Good movie,"This movie was entertaining all the way through. Each characters' emotions and actions were portrayed well by the actors. It was pretty brutal and gritty at times, so I would recommend certain younger people not be allowed to watch it.Overall, this is a good and entertaining movie."
3,Movie is OK,The movie is OK but I hate when movie dialog is quieter than shooting and music. The story line is OK and the acting is average. It is worth renting and watching but I'm glad I did not purchase this film
3,Why shi lebeouf?,I had very high hopes for this movie but it really let me down in alot of different ways. Tom hardy was the exception if it wasnt for him this movie would b 1 star...
3,It was just okay,Just an okay movie. Watch it on netflix if you really want to see it. Not worth renting or seeing in the theater.
3,not quite a downer,not bad but lack the action that I expected more of a good tv movie instead of the big screen.
5,Great Movie,"LOVED this movie...it is very raw, but VERY good! A girl friend and I rented it because of Shia LaBeof, but it was so good I watched it with my husband a second time!! (I think us girls liked it better than my husband :))"
3,Good movie,I thought it was a good action movie with some drama. I would recommend it for a Thursday or Friday night.
2,Broken,I love this movie but case inside and outside is broken very sloppy packed and movie delivered with case all broken very unhappy
2,was worth about .99 but not 3.99,I would say that this movie is about a 5.5 at best. Can't seem to think of a friend in mind that I would actually recommend this to.
2,Disappointing,A great storyline ruined. Beautiful country side. It seemed like a poor attempt of a generic take off on redneck Shakespeare
2,Strong Cast...Weak Script. .,"The characters never raelly develop the plot just wanders around. Its a shame, Tom Hardy had the potential for an epic preformance given a better script. Why is Gary Oldman even in this movie. His character is introduced and just vanishes. He sure sells the trailer though. Watch the trailer and skip the feature."
4,Very Good,"Great storyline, great acting, dragged at times but eventually would start moving again. Would recommend and watch again. Rent it."
2,I fell asleep watching it several times.,There were tough guys. It was about money somehow. People wanting to control and influence others. Nothing new or inspiring.
1,Did not enjoy at all,"I did not like this movie, for several reasons. The biggest reason was because it was REALLY drawn out. I like long movies typically, but this one just took forever to end (despite the good acting). I guess it was really the plot that was lacking. Not worth your rent if you ask me."
5,Good Movie!,This film is worth the watch. Great acting and good story.Old gangster movie with lots of action and gives good insight of times during the moonshine era.
4,Entertaining,Not for cgi junkies. Good story with good actors. I find movies about this fimd period and particularly this region very interesting. I would like to see more movies like this.
2,Lawless,"I wanted to see this movie because it appeared to be great a period piece in the tradition of Bonnie and Clyde. This movie did have some interesting segments and the acting was pretty good but, the pacing seem to drag and my interest kept fading in and out. Be prepared for some very graphic violence. Was this movie bad, I don't think so, but I do think it had the look and feel that could have made this into a real winner."
2,Inconclusive,The main character (LaBeouf) is not well developed and the story didn't come together well - a very unrealistic ending.
2,boring and slow,"Sound quality was not so good, besides I found the story moving very slow. Also, it seemed to glamorize crime but understand that the writer had limited flexibility as this was based on true story"
4,Good Story,I would give this 4 stars because I believe it had a good story line and overall was a good watch. Even though i don't care much for Shia LaBeouf he was ok in this movie.
4,Great Movie to watch.,"Action packed with a great cast.. This is a good movie to watch on your movie night at home, get some popcorn!"
4,Brothers of Moonshine and Guns,"Guns, moonshine and brotherhood blend this movie into a time long past.Storyline walks the predictable but the tension over whelms this family's troubles with themob boss's thirst for cheap mountain moonshine.There is no honor amongst thieves and locals and cops until the blood flows thicker thanwhite lightening.Casting is spot on and ""Lawless"" two would be a go see..Revenge of the Mob!Watch out for the gun usage, violence and partial nudity.Make sure the kids are asleep!"
2,Yarnless!!,It was a slow paced movie for me. Something that takes a while to warm up to. Just was not what i expected ...AT ALL!!
4,Violence and Tom Hardy.,"I thought this film was the bees knees. Violence, great story, superb villain, and Tom Hardy's beastly performance as an invincible brother. Even Cricket has a place in my heart. Very well done, bravo."
4,Ehhh,Could have been better. I found you really need to turn up your tv to understand what they are saying due to the southern accents the actors all carry. I gave it an extra star because it is based on a true story so it made it a little more interesting.
2,In a land where everyone is a psychopath...,In a land where everyone is a psychopath... except for one... and he really wants to be.Acting was good but the story was thin and you don't end up liking any of the characters.
1,Worst. Book. Ever.,"First off, let me say that you're not supposed to make everything in anthropology revolve around politics and bureaucratic garbage. This book was intended to study the anthropological aspects of the early American meatpacking industry and the diverse ethnic backgrounds of the workers involved in the industry and instead all it did was utilize reverse racism and political ploys to try and convince the reader that the reverse racism and extreme feminism are justifiable. In addition it is written by a feminist who states throughout the book that it's acceptable for women to do less work than men and still demand equal salary because men are the ones to blame for women being incapable of equivalent work productivity.I would never recommend this book to anyone. It has no real substance, it's all biased political banter and it's horribly written."
4,Jour De Fete,I thoroughly enjoy the off-beat comedy of Jacques Tati. Waiting for the next sight gag keeps you on the edge of your seat.
5,MY FAVORITE CHILDHOOD STORY BOOK,"I remember when i was in the first grade,on library day i would check out Jellybeans for Breakfast and recheck it out when we would have to take our books back.The Librarian told me i had to give the book up and let others have a chance to check it out. she told me if it was availible the next week on library day, i would be welcome to check it out again.I always prayed it would be on the shelf so i could re-read it over again. I would love to have a copy of the book, but i can not pay hundreds of dollars for it,Please re-publish this book whoever owns the rights to it!"
5,I think it works fine.,"I put this up to replace a set of amplified rabbit ears that we've been using. From the get go it out performed the rabbit ears, even when it was just laying on top of the blinds over the window. Once I got it mounted (inside close to the ceiling) and made sure the antenna cable wasn't lying next to power cables from the TV and DVD (they seemed to add interference) I was pulling in channels you couldn't even get a ghost singnal for with the rabbit ears. The TV towers aren't but 20 or 30 miles from me, so I can't comment on how it would work at large distances. Be sure and use the link given in the instruction booklet to see where your towers are located so you mount it pointing the right direction."
4,Pretty good antenna,"Read lots of ""hate"" mail for this guy so I guess I may be a lucky guy but mine works and works well. Had DirecTv install an oval dish for my new HD system and had already bought the TV55. He had never seen one so we just laid it in the floor of my attic, single story Condo, hooked it up and it worked great!!! No problems at all with no adjustments. I guess you just need to be lucky or good."
1,"Horrible Reception, Space-Age Looks..","I found this unit for $20.00 at Ocean-State Jobs lots here in Massachusetts. I figured this unit seems to get bad reviews for a $70-$100.00 unit. Maybe at $20.00 it will be worth it?Wow, was I wrong, this unit was completely outperformed by a $39.00 Amplified set-top unit and to add insult to injury, we got a few more channels using the bowtie that came bundled with an old TV we had in the basement!"
1,save your money,We live about 17 mile from the TV towers. When we decided to drop cable I stuck a coat hanger in the end of the cable and was able to get pretty good reception with a digital convert box hooked to my old TV. I figured a real antenna would give me better reception and possibly more channles. This antenna doesn't work any better than the coat hanger. I should have saved my money and stuck with the coat hanger.
1,It's underwear pure and simple,"Save your money and buy a pair of Hane's or Fruit of the Loom underwear. It's the same thing, just alot cheaper. What I really needed was a pair of biking shorts...padded in the seat."
3,use as briefs,I've been searching for this spandex with a cotton to wear as briefs. I find these shorts more comfortable then the traditional briefs and never cared for the extra fabric of boxers. This particular pair of shorts fit perfectly til a few machine washes. The bottem seam has already stretched out and rides up my leg. For the time being they will work but are not going to work for me enough to purchase another pair... so the search is back on
5,So Far So Good,I used this product to undercut some doors. It worked like a charm and left the wood with a clean finish.
2,This costed me $1.99 and I may have payed too much,"I'm gonna be honest, brandon lee was pretty good in this but there were just not really any fighting scenes or a stroy either. I need 1 of those 2 things to watch a movie. But it does have cool car chases(some) and a hot blonde that got me through the movie, so anything I can make it all the way through, I have to give it 2 stars.So like another reviewr said that I agree with, watch this only if you are a brandon lee fan like me and maybe watch it if you like bad movies you can laugh at cause there are plenty of parts to laugh at."
5,Washington-Obama,this is a GREAT puzzle. You get to learn the names and term dates of all the presidents! I even know what all the presidents faces look like with this puzzle. I love every president thing I can get my finger on!!! And this is one of my favorites. Highly recommended.Gabriel age 9 and my mama
5,Excellent update of London's classic,"Amazon's description (above) is totally wrong. There are no drug dealers in this modern adaptation of Jack London's classic novel. There is, however, a brilliant performance by Stacy Keach as the obsessed sea captain losing his mind. Fine action sequences directed by newcomer Gary McDonald who ought to be listed as the Primary Contributer."
1,NO AUDIO,Bought the DAN CURTIS series dvds and there was no sound on DORIAN. I have since replaced the DORIAN copy and still no sound.
1,MPI Goof,"I wanted to respond to the many reviewers regarding the poor audio quality of this DVD. Evidentally, the transfer was not up to the newer DVD player technology because it plays fine in my older player, but I experience a sound problem when I play it in my newer one. I intend to contact MPI and hopefully get this resolved, and a new, updated copy of this DVD.Until then, this one gets 1 star."
4,Nicely done performance,"The choir at the University of Miami has a good blend. There is also a good, sweet sense of intimacy in the style of singing these love songs.Some of the songs, however, suffered from a sense of languor or slowness. I would have liked to hear them picked up a bit - it became too much slowness.The final song (which is my favorite), ""Amor de mi Alma, for chorus & piano,"" had some blending difficulties. This is a simple song and designed for the concert hall. There was a sense sometimes that the choir was out of balance. But that's a minor nit for a wonderful song and wonderful performance."
3,Concise and precise,The book content is concise and precise. It summarizes the key points for easy memory and comprehension. It group the materials by topics.
3,Rock 'n Roll Wariors.,"Certainly not what they used to be. Oh well, it's a cool name for an album. Or groovy."
4,pretty decent....,"I gotta admit, it was better than I thought it was gonna be. I like Leonor Varela's performance (but then again, I liked her as Cleopatra) and I couldn't pass on seeing Ashton Kutcher in chaps and a cowboy hat.Let's just say, if you're looking to compare to Tombstone, Young Guns, or Magnificent Seven, save your $... If you're looking for a bit of a laugh and some action, get the movie. Trust me, I didn't think too much of James Van Der Beek's performance, but Ashton Kutcher, Usher Raymond (surprise surprise), Randy Travis, Leonor Varela and Dylan McDermott (sp?) add to the movie. Happy viewing!..."
2,HOW TO KILL - BY BORING PEOPLE TO DEATH!!!,"How to Kill is not much of a book series. If you shell out a lot of money, you learn ""secret"" killing techniques. Do you know, for example, if you cut someone's head off there's a 100% chance they will die? You are given the ususal blueprints for making your own specialized firearms (although something tells me anything you make will probably blow up in your face!). In short, there is nothing unusual about the series except for one thing - it was BANNED!Strange as it may seem, the government of Canada forbade people from ordering it directly from America. Rumor has it some people had sympathetic Americans buy it for them then ship it from said American's home address.Me thinketh the Canadian government has been eating too much beaver meat!!!"
3,Good Enough for the price,"This is the third time I have purchased the same maintenance kit, and the second time for the same seller. Although I do see a slight difference between the original kit from HP, it also cost double. As most of my clients now switch over to copier for most of the printing in reducing cost. The slight difference as a backup machine becoming much for sensible. Therefore, I would recommend the kit if you not using the printer as a primary printing."
5,ear plugs,"ex product. ex shipping. ex price. been using these since 1994 in commercial construction and never once had a defective pair. BUT if they get wet, throw them out, they no longer compress enough to hold the form long enough to be inserted into the ear canal. Just ordered my umteenth box of 100. Wont work without them, ALSO GREAT TO CUT WIND NOISE WHEN RIDING THE MOTORCYCLE!!! Be kind to your hearing, you'll miss it when it's gone. Mike"
1,I have seen better,"I am sorry that I do not have the same enthusiasm as the other reviewers. I am French and I teach French at the High School level. I will not show this movie to my students as it would bore them to death. If you suffer from insomnia, this is the perfect remedy."
1,passed ages-passed showcases,"I simply spent time watchnig this French response to a Chaplin-style but non-silent motion picture.Maybe, it was a top at the timing of the making."
3,"Not bad, but map colors are poor","This book covers all of WWII. It is like reading a book with text, pictures, and maps. It is full of information. The biggest draw back to this book is the map colors. The only colors you will see is black, gray, red, pink, & white."
1,Live???,"If this truly is a ""Lone Justice"" video, it needs clarification as such, with the addition of a picture of the video, band name, and song listings, otherwise it is a generic listing that could be any live video!!If I were a buyer, I would be VERY reluctant to purchase it, as even the sellers do not reveal anything about the video other than its condition???"
3,"Good, but not great","This film, based on the real-life murders in Texarkana in 1946, is a, for the most part, historically accurate dramatization. The hooded killer is suitably menacing and the lead actor performs well but the film is almost ruined by the ridiculous comedic subplot involving a deputy who gives Don Knott's Barney Fife a run for his money. Those expecting another Friday the 13th/Halloween clone are advised to look elsewhere, this film was released two years before Halloween and is devoid of gore, instead it focuses on suspense and the psychological impact the murders play on the citizen's minds. Still, I recommend it to true crime and serial killer film enthuaists."
3,The Town that Dreaded Good Dental Hygiene,"Well, the truth is that this movie is not all it's cracked up to be (i.e., it's not as good as my fellow reviewers make it out to be). It is not bad, however. It is nowhere as bad as Charles Pierce's (the director) other schlock movie, known as ""The Legend of Boggy Creek""). This pseudo-documentary depicts the story of a burlap bag hooded killer who scopes out lovers' lane people then attacks, mames, and sometimes murders them (unless they miraculously escape or survive the attack). I've read that Jason in Friday the 13th, Part 2 is dressed up to resemble the killer in this movie. Yes, this movie is based on a true life event. But, beyond that hint of realism, there is nothing extraordinary about the film. A re-opening of the case for Court TV or A&E (with Bill Kurtis) would make for some good television."
3,Some Funny Stuff for a Change from National Lampoon,"Having seen some of the many movies that have National Lampoon above the title, it's refreshing to see one that actually has some funny moments. It's inconsistent in delivery, exceptionally crude (duh!), with language, topless girls (that's a good thing!), and is far from the worst. A parody of modern sword-and-sandal A-movies like Troy, Alexander, 300, and Gladiator, it throws out as many gags as it can. Much better than the similar sword-and-sandals parodies. I was surprised."
1,Poor performer,"In hopes of improving our DTV reception, this product was given good marks here at Amazon and other DTV websites. But it only provided disappointing results. Our basic bow-tie antenna pulled in twice as many stations. The product also claimed to have an 'adjustable' loop - not so.If you already have a working portable antenna and want better performance (and more stations) consider an active (amplified) antenna.Good luck."
1,Too much underground!!,"I don't know...maybe I'm more into the the 90's grunge but this is an album that compiles a dark and underground grunge sound I'm not used to. Despite there are a lot of bands, the songs are very alike and I simply don't like it...even Soundgarden which I've loved them, sounds very similar to the other bands there...but if you are interested on this kind of sound just let me know and I can sell this album to anyone of you!"
3,"well researched, poorly written","My first exposure to this author. Well researched, but I think it could have used some more colorful writing. I know it is more of a historical document, but I reallt think Mr. Pickover could of had a lot more fun with it. Plus, there are many, many medical mysteries that aren't even touched. I wish he would have more compare and contrasting. Easy read."
2,Plot..Slow/ Animation...Good/ Music...Better,"In short, new crew of a new solar sail powered ship find young girl in space. Go against orders to help her. Go on long, long trip of discovery & discover......NOTHING! Only good part...opening few minutes of this anime. I wish I could find the cd."
5,A Vote For Murder,Jessica does it again. I have been a Angela Lansbury fan for 40 years and when reading these books I can see her and all of the gang from Cabot Cove.
3,Not Sure how water resistant this thing is,"For the price this box is okay. The color looks faded/distorted but who cares it's not going to be used as a handbag at a fashion show.One possible problem though is; yes it does have O ring seal to supposedly to make it water resistant but when you latch down the cover, it does not seem to seal tight (like mil spec ammo cans). What use is a rubber seal if the cover does not press down tight to the body of the box to make use of the seal in between? I am using it to store ammo so I just threw some dessicant packs in there and hope very little moisture gets in. It is what it is I guess."
2,To much singing,"I didn't care for this album because it was more about singing than instrumental elements. The beatboxing was not very good nor was it a good touch. The lyrics were boring (the ones in english) and it was just really annoying. People who like folk or jewish music stuff like that then mabey you would like this. All though I do like massada witch is jewish music ((klesmer) I am sure its the wrong spelling)) this cd I did not like. Execpt songs 1,2 and one of the latter tracks."
4,The poppiest of the big beat breed,"Mint Royale succeed where other of their ilk (eg. Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, Propellerheads) do not because they are tied to the pop melody rather than the DJ schtick. Their arrangements are lush and melodic, their tunes emotive and their songs all under 5 minutes! Ignoring the novelty value of 'Singing In The Rain', there's a wealth of wonderful pop moments on this album and an even greater wealth on their two previous outings. For a damn good time try 'On The Ropes', for a slightly more melancholic dose of their charms, go for 'Dancehall Places'. 'See You In The Morning' is more soft and reflective than bright and bubbly but it's a fine record with those trademark washes of melody running throughout. Recommended."
2,"good game, but some flaws","ok, the game was really good, but at first, it is very boring. untill disk two, the story is very repetitave, adn also, you fight a bad guy every 5 seconds or so, which is really bad and annoying. if that doesnt bother you, then buy this, becasue the ending of the story is great and the graphics and sounds are awesome, but i couldnt stand these two major flaws"
5,What a surprise!,"Being a hardcore Final Fantasy fan I was skeptical about this game! I've seen many bad RPGs! I shiver just thinking about some of them. This game isn't Final Fantasy and thats good! Real good. BUY THIS GAME! This game is a ""stay up all nighter!"" Very aspect is perfect! It's just perfect. No, I'm not cheating on you Final Fantasy 7, which I 've played and beaten oh... 22 times. Seriously, they have different feels. The game doesn't feel like the developers were trying to imitate FF. It stand on its own! Like a real game should!"
3,LeakyCooker,"The rice cooker leaks water @ the very top all over my countertop. If you use the correct measurement for white rice, the steamer @ the top won't drip but sometimes the rice is too dry.Brown rice requires more water and more water creates leaks. If you can get the measurement exactly right, then the cooked rice will be almost perfect. The rice cooker needs to be wiped clean after each usage as water accumulates inside the lid which is another flaw in this machine."
1,Very disappointed,"While cooking rice, a large amount of liquid trickles from the vapor vents and makes a big mess. It is supposed to be for 5 cups but the problem occurs even with only one cup. I called Panasonic who were extremely unhelpful, passing me from tech to tech, putting me on hold, and asking me to repeat the product info and explain the problem 7 times. After almost an hour, I was told that this was normal but if I wanted, I could take it to repair two hour from where I live. According to them, most likely nothing was wrong and they would not take it back. Apparently Panasonic does not stand behind their products and there is no such thing as ""satisfaction guaranteed."" Worst $70+ I've ever spent."
2,Steaming and Spitting Rice Cooker,Overall this rice cooker is doing the job. I just don't like cleaning up afterwards. The steam coming out of the lid can make a mess. I have to clean it up everytime. I would recommend a different brand or model that can cook rice without additional work.
4,Getting to know the Oscar,"Theres not much out there about the Hayabusa, so I gave it 4 stars by default. It covers the development, & use in combat of the oscar. There are alot of photos, but they are of poor quality being very grainy. Thats why I gave 4 stars. Some of the photos show why the hayabusa was often mistaken for the navy's A6M. They have similar side profiles. A good addition to ww2 aviation library simply because there isn't much else."
4,A solid academic commentary on Luke's Gospel,"This is a good solid commentary, though expensive (it's a three volume set). But Nolland has many good insights, and despite the all too brief introduction, it is a valuable addition to your library if you're studying the Gospel of Luke. My only other complaint is that the Explanation section merely repeats key sentences in the commentary section without giving any further practical wisdom."
4,Met-Rx Big 100,"These bars are great to have after a work out and very satisfying, especially if you down it with a glass of water or fruit juice. I recommend these to all my students."
1,"I usually love this product, but.....","... when I opened the first package of this one and took my first bite, the taste sensation was horrible, maybe this was left out in the heat over the summer. It kind of had a sickly cherry taste and smell. Tried another bar the same!!! Again, I love these bars, but now am leery about ordering again! Food should taste good... this pack did not!!!!"
3,pushing maximum density,"I purchased these because it's against my employer's dress code to wear sweat pants at work and I was getting too fat for my clothes. I used to eat these as a snack with my breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, or after dinner snack, but now I feast on these suckers as meal replacement. If you don't have a variety you will get tired of them real quick."
2,More Sugar than a twix!,"I bought these because I read an article (that was obviously wrong) saying that these only had 2grams of sugarbut it has 26grams!!!! that's more than a regular chocolate/candy bar.taste wise they are pretty good but that's because anything dipped in sugar is delicious.I don't care how much Protein it has if you are hurting everything else.if you are serious don't buy them, if you don't have weight problems and want the protein go ahead and buy these candy bars."
5,The book on Bipolar disorder,"Dr. Torrey's ""Surviving Schizophrenia"" has long been the ""bible"" for people suffering from that illness and their families. Now, thankfully, the author (who in a Washington Post porfile was called, 'the most famous psychiatrist in America') explains the complexities of manic depression in an understandable way that few come close to. For anyone who has or loves someone with manic depression, this is your manual. When it comes to this confounding condition, there are not always answers but what answers there are are in this book."
3,Middle of the road,"Good set of knee pads, will scratch flooring material! I would recommend a softer set of pads for interior finish work. ( I was scratching up linoleum...) The straps are nice because they can un-clip fast. They are kind of uncomfortable but decent."
5,If you love Steve McQueen!,"This movie is wonderful, and probably, I dare say, McQueen's best movie! He isso compelling in this as a ""stranger"" who had a 1-night stand with a pretty girl, onlyto have her come up to him at a musician's union hall and tell him that he is thefather of her baby.Natalie Wood is precious; stuck in an Italian family who won't mind their own businessand not her's! Her brothers are difficult, but protective. They mean well.It is truly one of the best movies ever made!"
5,Fabulous! A Beautiful Love Story!,"I LOVE this film! When you watch it you must remember that it was made in the 1960s and it was quite a groundbreaking film. Natalie Wood is BRILLIANT (her finest performance) as Angie, a girl who becomes pregnant and suddenly forced to take control of her own life. Steve McQueen is fabulous as the man who impregnated her. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
2,Not your usual yoga or ab workout,"I've only tried one other Kundalini DVD--Mantra Girl. It isn't like this one, and I'm not familiar with Kundalini so it's difficult for me to say what the typical Kundalini practice is like.There are some poses that really work your abs. There's also a lot of breath work, some meditation, and unusual movements like arching your spine back and forth while sitting with your legs folded beneath you. You don't need the flexibility or endurance you do for some yoga practices. Also, the DVD version is relatively well-chaptered so you don't have to do the whole thing, though I felt funny starting in the middle of the practice. So this might be good for someone new to yoga or someone looking for a unique practice.I personally prefer Yogilates 2 or Baron Baptiste's Core Power for yoga-based ab work. I usually do yoga to relax, build strength, or focus on my breath within the context of controlled moves. This one just didn't fit my idea of an ab workout or a yoga practice."
3,it's missing something,"Maybe i missed something in reading the reviews, but I had assumed the cd with the book included backing tracks, especially as one reviewer mentions the band. Most of these instruction book/cds do include backing tracks, at least the ones I have. Playing along with a good rhythm section, in time and in tune, is the only way to master the tunes and improve as a player and also by the way a lot of fun. On the plus side, although i'm not a huge fan of Andy A's playing and tone, I really respect his Hendrix-related work; the text and his commments in this book are extensive and helpful and entertaining, and the notes as usual seem pretty accurate to me."
4,Yet Another Cool Jango Fett Figure From Hasbro!,"Call me a Fett fanatic: I just HAVE to have anything Jango-or-Boba related....This version of Jango has quick-draw action; Pressing the rocket on his jet-pack makes both of his arms spring up so he's posed in a shooting stance. (He only keeps the pose until you let go of the button.) Mr. Fett Sr.'s blasters fit into his holsters VERY loosely, and can get lost easily (Take it from me....); Too bad Hasbro didn't bind them to his hands like in some of the other Fett figures. His pose is kind of weird, and he looks a little....off...when he's in his shooting stance: His eyes are looking up and to the side, when they should be focused dead ahead. And I would have liked it if he came with a helmet. But these are small quibbles to a true Fett fanatic! Get the figure!!"
4,Benny Mardones Tells It Like It Is,"As straight shooters go in music, Benny proudly delivers a message for everyone from 18 to 81, and with the music that's wrapped around the words ... You can't go wrong!For the dreamers, fighters, and hopeless romantics in the world, A Journey Through Time is as pleasant as it is uplifting.In a desperate world, steeped in chaos, score one for Benny Mardones:-) BULLSEYE !..."
5,Delightful book,This book is great. The simplicity of her descriptions and rituals really entrance's someone like me who doesn't have a lot of space and doesn't care for all the pomp and fluff. Barbara Ardinger's style of writing is easy to read and her humor hits target after target every time. She has a great way to talking to you through her writing instead of at you. Very informative and helpful.
4,Anna's life as a refugee continues from age 15-21,"This sequel to When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit jumps from age 12 when Pink Rabbit concluded to age 15. Anna and her family are coping, at times quite desperately, as refugees in London as war finally breaks out for England and then the U.S. This continuation of a young girl's coming of age in the midst of Hitler's attack on Europe, illustrates the hardships that Jews were confronted with who escaped Hitler's final solution. Since Anna's family were Germans, even though they would have been annihilated by the Third Reich, they were not allowed employment and other essential means for survival. How they survive, and Anna's and Max's (her older brother) coming of age in such conditions, are told, miraculously, without bitterness. I am now reading the final volume of Anna's story, A Small Person Far Away."
1,Just can't get it right,"Clinton Heylin's book is filled with misinformation, inaccurate quotes and pirated material. In fact, he and his publisher are being sued by one of the ""many"" girlfriends he quotes from throughout for using her copywritten proposal and manuscript in his own book without permission. He even uses the errors in her proposal (i.e., Narette is his daughter), as being true without checking facts. He is also a terrible writer and the editing was awful."
4,Dylan deserves far more contempt than this,"From NOTES FROM HAMPSTEAD by Elias Canetti: ""Contempt for one's fellows must be balanced with self-contempt. If the latter prevails, then the writer is lost: he will destroy himself like Gogol. If the former prevails, the result is a prophet: arrogantly certain in his belief, he is a threat to the world, and thus ecstatically he helps bring about its destruction. Finding the right balance.""Well needless to say, Dylan's self-contempt is nonexistent. And his arrogant self-righteousness is breathtaking. Here's a guy whose adulteries destroyed his marriage and yet he still has the arrogance to chastize other people for being non-Christians.I additionally hate Bob Dylan for his self-congratulatory artsy-fartsy name. I wish Bob Zimmerman had changed his name to Bob Zim."
3,"Pretty, but not much substance","""The Dream is Alive"" does not do well in the transition to the small screen. Its pretty footage of the shuttle in flight is inevitably less impressive, and it does not have enough substance to make up for the loss of spectacle.The film is largely a puff-piece for the shuttle program sponsored by Lockheed and NASA. Its simple boosterism (so to speak) is a bit embarassing after the Challenger, the Columbia, and the growing consensus that the Shuttle program was a blind alley at best, a white elephant at worst.Some other IMAX films on DVD make up for the loss of spectacle by adding substance, but ""The Dream is Alive"" has no added features or commentary. It's also quite short. Even for fans of the Space Shuttle itself, other IMAX films such as ""Space Station"" will provide better value for money."
5,My favorite dolls!,"I love the Bratz dolls! They are my favorite kind of dolls. I'm 11 and I still play with dolls and these are the coolest out of all of my dolls! There are still some things is don't like about them though: 1)They have too much make-up on 2)it's kind of gross because they have no feet 3)Some of their long pants are kind of hard to get on. Overall, these are still my favorite dolls and I really want to get more of them for Christmas and my Birthday!"
4,The Hundred Dollar Girl,"Joe Puma is here with his ""I don't take crap from anybody unless he's holding a gun to my face, and even then"" attitude. He is the iconic good guy. He has his way with the ladies while he's investigating murder and the fight rackets. Gault seems to pull the end out of his hat. A fun, quick read. Recommended."
3,They Ran Out!,"Well, I hate to say it, but the Wayans Brothers finally ran out of funny stuff. Don't be a menace and Scary movie was funny as all get out. Scary movie movie 2 was still funny but, TOO disgusting. All that nasty stuff really made me fast foward through most of the movie. Some one need to tell the directors that nasty isn't funny."
1,WORST SEQUEL EVER...,"Simple as that: the worst sequel ever. Clearly rushed, clearly designed to shock, with all that nasty and disgusting scenes, the Wayan Brothers reached a new low point here."
2,Had funny parts but overall not great,"I saw this movie yesterday (the 4th of July). It did have many funny jokes in it, but they mostly stopped after the middle of the movie and i just got boring. The first Scary Movie was defintely better than the first one. I have to say I was very dissapointed."
3,not as great as the original but pretty funny,"This movie felt rushed to me. It is mainly because I think the filmmakers saw the money the first Scary Movie made and rushed in to a sequel. This was a disaster, it only made 70 millon compared to the 120 millon that Scary Movie madeBasically, they take the plot of The Haunting, where they are in this haunted house, add the plot of Hollow Man, where they have to kill the ghost, and they have different film parodies like What Lies Beneath, The Polgerist, and numerous others. Then, they add some sick and digusting jokes that are not funny and this is not a great film."
2,A priest makes out with the devil?,"""Thumbs Down!""SCARY MOVIE II has to be the worst sequel this summer! It was weak, with little humor which couldn't surpass the original. Though, I didn't even think the original was so great. With spoofs on The Exorcist, Cast Away, Charlie's Angels and so on, Scary Movie II just won't be as appealing to audiences this time around. Just because Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans and Anna Faris return, and Keenen Ivory Wayans returns as director, doesn't mean that the sequel is always promising. Stupid, Stupid, Stupid is all I have to say for this movie."
1,"It's not entertainment, it's a punishment","I laughed a total of 3 times during the movie, and they were all non-consecutive. About a third of the way through, I almost walked out of the theatre. Folks, I have seen about 200 movies in the theatre and have not walked out ONCE. This movie is not only an insult to me, but an insult to the intelligence of every human being on this planet. Recycled jokes, more cursing than a high school hallway, and pictures of things so revolting...and don't want to talk about. Go and rent the ORIGINAL movie for some great laughs. DO NOT GO TO THIS MOVIE OR YOU WILL HAVE ENTERED THE BOWELS OF HELL!!"
5,Funny.,"This was the funniest movie ever.I laughed at alot of the jokes In this movie.The opening credits scene was good,and so was the Exorcist scene,and the scene when Cindy punches a girl several times.This Is a good movie to watch along with the first."
1,SUCKED BIG TIME!,"I watched this movie with my cousins last year. I thought it sucked big time. The whole Exorcist part was funny, but the genitals for door-knockers? I mean, come on, give me a break. The movie was sick, and gross. I walked out of my living room during the movie, and I came back in 2 or 3 times. The plot was stupid. The turkey scene was sick, and I walked out. I give it a big 0, and It was the grossest movie I've ever seen. I hated it, and I recommend not to watch it."
1,Soooo stupid....... and NOT funny !!!!!!!!,Boring. Gross-out gags in volume do not make a comedy movie. The number of spoken gags fall below 40. The sight gags are timed wrong and far too annoying to be funny. If you subtract the stupid things in this movie you have about 6 minutes left to view. Far too much money for so very little.
2,"Had funny parts, but overall not great","I saw this movie yesterday and it did have funny jokes in it, but they mostly stopped after the middle, of the movie and I just got boring. The first Scary Movie was defintely better than the second. I have to say I was very disappointed"
1,"Horrible, Lousy, Waste of time!","The movie was just plain stupid. There was no tie-in to the original movie. The plot was pointless, the gags were ridiculous, it looked like a 5 year old created them.The beginning was completely pointless and gross, it didn't even belong with the movie. The characters were not developed and it seemed as if they rushed just to get it out on time.There was one point where they didn't have enough money to purchase walkie talkies... So, you guessed it, they used paper cups with strings... It was completely stupid...Sorry I am using the word stupid so much, but it was a complete waste of film. The entire movie was a waste of everyone's time, the actors included.Ken"
2,Scary Movie 2,A bit disappointing after Scary Movie 1. But then it is rare that sequels go on too be better.
3,So-So,I was a fan of the First Scary Movie so I went but it turn out it wasn't as good as it could of been. The movie started strong but went downhill after that. I think it is bad to start with a great start because it make the rest of the movie look bad. I expected great jokes after a opening like that.Only see if you liked the first one.
5,Best Movie EVER!,"This is not only my favorite movie, but one of the most well-written and hilarious films I have ever seen. Anybody who disagrees can just go and shove the DVD up their DVD Player and watch it again to see the pure genius in this movie. I love it...you should too. BUY THIS MOVIE TODAY!"
3,not so funny,"Scary movie 2 is an ok movie.it is funny at times, but not as good as scary movie 1 or 3."
1,STUPID MOVIE 2 IS MORE LIKE IT,"After watching Scary Movie and enjoying some funny moments in that film I was hoping this would be as good. Scary Movie 2 is just plain stupid and I stopped watching it after about twenty minutes as I could see where this film was going.Bottom line is that while you expect this film to be funny and have a few stupid moments in it,it is actually the other way around. It is stupid and has few funny moments in it.Don't waste your time on this one..."
2,"Some interesting tonalities, but . . .","Every track but one has a simple, thumping percussion line, an artifact of modern music which I increasingly find tedious. No doubt it is easier to appeal to the brain stem rather than the prefrontal lobes. Unobjectionable as background music, but not actually worth listening to. Perhaps best described as music which one may hopefully, in time, grow out of."
5,Beautiful!,"This is one of the most heartful, wonderful movies ever made. It's sad and heartbreaking at some parts, but it's all leveled out with a crapicious character played by Audrey Hepburn. A must-see!"
2,Disappointed,"So not at all what i was expecting.I had heard a lot of good things about this movie over the years and when i finally sat down to watch it,i was terribly disappointed and confused."
4,Classic Hollywood,"Audrey Hepburn stars in her most well-known movie role. George Peppard costars as her neighbor. Soundtrack with famous song ""Moon River."" New York City is the bakdrop for this film. Buddy Ebsen has a cameo and Mickey Rooney in a politically uncorrect role."
4,The Masterpiece That Is Breakfast At Tiffany's,"What an amazing piece of cinematography! With fabulous acting and supurb direction, this has rightfully earned it's place with the rest of Hollywood's classics. The final scene is incredible, the plot twists unsuspected, and the characters wonderful."
4,A Blake Edwards' Movie.,"How does one define, even try to give an assessment. Forget it...Peppard is wooden, Heperd is wooly, and Rooney is some where different.You have a bitter sweet romanTic comedy: done with equal amounts of bathos anf farce.Blake Edward's could do it and in this film he did it."
4,Shocked!,"I have to admit that after I first saw this film...I didn't not like it at all! But of course I had no idea what this movie was about and had alot of very different expectations. After seeing other Audrey Hepburn movies (like ""My Fair Lady"" and ""Funny Face"") I expected a character that was sweet and naive. I was very surprised...but after I saw it again I really enjoyed the film. Holly Golightly is a girl who dates men for money. While Paul Varjak is a writer who is currently down on his luck and somewhat is in the same line of business that Holly is. Audrey Hepburn broke out of her usual character role and was faboulous in this movie. Even though this movie wasn't exactly like the novel (from what I heard) this movie was definitely probably shocking for the 1960's. And even though it has its faults (Mickey Rooney's role) it is a movie every girl should see!"
4,I can't help it,"I like this movie. Yes, she's a materialistic playgirl and he has a sugar mama, but there's about it that is appealing. Maybe it's the hopeful optimism or Holly's strange sweetness that just makes you want to fix her life. There's some comic relief (especially in the party scene), despite Rooney's ridiculous portrayal of a Japanese guy. And, who would have thought one could live without sterling silver telephone dialer? What a great concept. Too bad my cell doesn't have a rotary dial."
4,Very good Golf Shirt,Just got my 2 Arnold Palmers.Very good shirts...............washed 1 already and it was excellent.Great price great shirt.
4,A meal for one,"Who? What? Where? and Why? These questions are made to seem rather silly during this insane laughter riot. Brill is on obscenely average form behind the lens and veteran clown Aslan Sanders shows he's no mug even afer 5 years pandering to the greasepaint. Ingenious sight gags are promised but I saw no sign of the promised sight gags. Particularly puzzling is the decision not to set the whole story in the desert. At times I thought I had gone to the wrong film but soon realised I hadn't. The ending is poor, the worst since the last one. Good effort."
1,This movie stinks,This movie does not even deserve a star. Adam Sandlar is a great actor but this was the worst movie I have ever seen. It is not one bit funny.
1,Wow ..... what a piece of garbage!,"This movie almost (by itself) destroyed Adam Sandler's career. Not that its much of a career, he plays the same character in all of his films .... but it's a likable character. By the end of this film though, I wanted to reach through the screen and smack Sandler so bad to make him stop that ridiculous voice.His friends were their usual funny selves, but the talking dog (Smeigel) was just bad. I expect higher standards from the same guy who does Triumph the Insult Comic Dog.I do agree that there are some great cameo's though and Keitel does a great job in his limited role. But these do not save this film."
4,Help,I thought the movie was great but i cant find out what the song was when the two guys are walking into the cop shop to turn nicky in. I really like the song and if anybody knows what it is could you please tell me beermasterking@yahoo.com
4,heaven on earth!,"If comedy is the food of life I feel sick. That is what I would have said if I thought this film wasn't funny. Actually I thought debutant Aaron Sandler produced one of the funniest performances since Mason Howard in Monkey Mayhem. I did not stop laughing all the way through. Superhuman efforts from the majority of the third unit only served to increase my enjoyment of every scene. Well every scene apart from the obvious one. By utilising a combination of audio and vision, 'the directors director' has plucked a metaphorical rabbit from his metophorical hat. If there is a funnier movie this year all credit to the cast and crew. A classic of its kind, Little Nicky succeeds in genre-bending to moving effect. Congratulations. Top marks!"
2,jamon,"of course the dvd has got more to offer - what film hasn't. but what i feel is important in this film is the questioning of our ultimate fate. very rarley does a work of art challenge our expectatiioons of what a work of art should do. but this film does it. in spades. for me, the crux was methusala challenging travis to a vocabuulary test. which obviously is an easy contest. but then again, how does one square the root problem of disenfranchisement? by ignoring the poor beggers, of course. the poor are obviously a burden on capitaist society, which little nicky excpresses beautifully. adam sandler is probably the greatest ever melancolic fool since jim robinson died of a coranary disease. and one can only hope that sandler befalls a similar fate. soon."
3,"Excellent DVD, not the best Fellini","I love Fellini's movies and have them all on DVD. ""Casanova"" was the only one I didn't have since it has never been released before on DVD, so I snatched it up. The quality is excellent, but this has never been one of my favorite Fellini films. However, any Fellini film is interesting and belongs in the collection."
5,Great Quality,"I have little experience when it comes to incense because the last time I bought it was five or so years ago from the mall, but the stuff that I got was still moist, it wasn't too crumbly, and it smelled amazing. I'm guessing that means that it's still fresh. Either way, it's a great value and it burns wonderfully."
5,Favorite all time incense,"My boy friend is super allergic to many things but he is not bothered with Nag Champa, lucky me! Good old faithful!"
1,Incense that doesn't burn,Decided to try a new brand of incense......big mistake. Do not bother with this item. I light these incense sticks and they do not burn. It was a waste of money.
2,Very disappointed,"I originally bought a package of these because I had heard good things about them. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the quality of the sticks. They didn't smell very strong either in the package, or burning, and I had to keep re-lighting the stick. Since all of the reviews were so good, I thought maybe I just got an old package of them, so I bought a second pack from another store. The second pack didn't smell any stronger, but they did stay lit a little better. It may just be my personal preference, but I like for my incense to have a stronger smell, so I will stick with the brand I had been using."
5,My Absolute Favorite,These sticks are the best I've found so far!! Although I wish they weren't as expensive as they are.. this is the cheapest I've found them and I would definitely buy again! They take a long time to burn and thats awesome. Put them in a stick coffin and it smells even more amazing. I definitely recommend these to everyone! You'll love em.
3,Perfect for the age group,"This Batman figure hits the mark with it's target audience, kids under 10,we have a 7 year old boy and a 3 year old girl and they both love it.The figure comes with an extra long cape that looks really cool when you make him ""float"" down with the batarang in his hand.This new ""The Batman"" show will be a big hit with the kids, as soon as this show hits the air be ready to start buying the figures for them. We have only seen the first show so far and already the kids are asking to get more of ""The Batman"" toys.(...)The only real downside to this figure is that his arms are molded to stay in the same position that they are in the package, but with all 10"" rotocast figures you very rarely see any articulation."
3,IDENTIFY WHICH DISC YOU'RE DISCUSSING!,"When reviewers discuss the features for a DVD of a particular film, is it really too much effort to IDENTIFY THE RELEASE COMPANY OF THE DISC YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?!!! God, that's one of the things on Amazon reviews that piss me off the most....This films is in the Public Domain, so they're are AT LEAST 7 different discs on the market with it on it. What I've managed to uncover from my own research, is that Warner Brothers release has the best image quality for the film AND it's widescreen, but the Hart Sharp 2 disc 50th Anniv. Edition has the best extras, so to really have a good DVD package of this film you'll have to buy 2 releases."
5,Expert Results On The First Try!,"I have only been woodworking for about a year, but I have already built about half the trucks in this book. They are not only fun to build, but not too difficult. Every kid I've shown them too has gone nuts over them! I can't recommend this book enough as a great learning tool for the entry level woodworker. It's a great confidence builder."
1,Disaster,"I purchased 3 of these for my co-workers use while travelling overseas. So far 2 of the units have melted, smoked, and blew fuses. These are a real fire hazard and should not be used. I am very disappointed."
5,travel adapter,"Excellent product, price and response time. I received it earlier than expected. It was indispensable on my recent trip to Indochina where I took over 1500 photos!Highly recommended."
1,Junk,"Plugged laptop power supply in to charge (not an auto-sensing power supply!) batteries, melted the adapter before a fuse blew.My wife plugged in a hair dryer prior to this, and blew the fuse out of the fuse holder. 900w hair dryer. 1600w mode. Blew up. Junk!I second the motion to just buy the stuff where ever you are going."
5,Great deal on a great product,Everything plus was included in the package and the item was shipped very quickly. directions made for easy installation and the cost beat anythign i could find in the stores. my husband and i are very pleased with this purchase. it looks great and works perfectly.
5,Great Buy- easy to set up.,I did a lot of research & this was the best wall mount at the best price...easy to install- had everything we needed.
2,provided screws broke during installation,"Bought this to mount a 46"" Toshiba. The mount itself appeared solidly built. Instructions were a little sparse but fairly straightforward.I drilled four 3/16"" pilot holes, 2 1/2"" inches deep into the studs, as recommended. But while ratcheting the supplied lag screws in, two of the screws snapped (I kept on going after the first one broke since I had this brief thought that maybe there'd be enough support with only 3 screws in place). Even more annoying, one of the screws snapped off with maybe a 1/4"" of it still protruding, making it extremely difficult to remove or cover over.I ended up buying some SPAX screws from Home Depot and using those to mount the TV a couple of inches higher than I had originally wanted it, without further incident. I guess you could argue it was better that the screws snapped off during installation, rather than while the TV was hanging! But of course, we shouldn't have to be worried about the screws breaking at all.."
2,Screws break - stay from this product until its fixed!,"Had a terrible time mounting this on the studs since 3 screws broke simply when tightening them (and not over tightening)! There is probably a reason why Sanus is supplying 6 screws instead of just 4 and also have the following sentence in their first line of instructions - ""DO NOT OVER-TIGHTEN THE SCREWS"". Hopefully, they will take care of the quality of these screws. Otherwise, a great product."
5,Excellent and very easy to install,"Purchased this for the following TV:Panasonic VIERA S1 Series TC-P54S1 54-Inch 1080p Plasma HDTV, BlackVery, very easy to install and comes with variety of hardware for various TVs. Our TV was 54 inch and 90 pounds and we had no problem hanging it on the mount.The tilting function is very nice. It allows you to get the correct viewing angle."
4,Excellent mount for large flat screens,"I bought the Sanus wall mount for my 55"" Toshiba LED TV. I found the package to include every possible piece of hardware you could ever need. The mount has tilt brackets mounted to the back of my unit that makes the hookups possible without taking the TV off the bracket. As close as this mount fits to the wall, I don't see how new cables could be added without the tilt frature. The tilt bracket is locked by two knobs and that is the source of my ""4"" rating. I can barely tighten one side because of clearance to the wall and had to get someone with a smaller arm to do the other side. A simple tool for tighting the tilt bracket and this product would be perfect.Mounted to the wall studs with four large lag bolts, the sturdy mount bracket gives no worries about the security of the my heavy TV. High quality and good pricing makes this poduct a good buy for mounting your flat screen."
4,No complaints,"Prompt delivery. Quality product. Easy installation (though I got it done by a professional, this being the first wall mount I am having and I didn't want to take a chance with my kid around)."
3,Great Mount - Cheap Screws - Warning,"It was actually easy to install EXCEPT for the fact screws snap. When you get to the last 1/4"" of screw the bolts into the wall be very careful the can weaking and snap. Do you want your expense tv hanging on these cheap screws.... I don't think so. I went to Orchard Hardware and bought new screws after two snapped in off in the wall. Before you ask did I drill pilot holes... ah yes... I followed directions to a t. Which I have say are very goofy looking directions. Do I feel I tightened the screws to tight... not really since I still had a washer moving around. Just cheap quality. We are relying on our tv staying put not hitting the floor because of cheap screws."
5,Champagne on Beer Budget,"Great product. Much beefier than needed for my 46 inch! Great selection of fasteners. Option to set it 3/4 of an inch out from wall with spacers, which is great when it comes time to plug in all the equipment! Shorted me 4 proper sized washers, but I had some on hand, but real problem for those who don't keep extra hardware laying around. Very easy to install. Angle adjust takes very little effort. Would have been nice to have one central area designated for cords to run to keep them all a little better organized, but this is a not really a design flaw. A few zip ties takes care of this anyway. If I end up with a second tv that needs a wall mount, I would buy this one again in a heartbeat."
5,Great wall mount,"We bought this for our 46"" TV, and it's perfect. It was easy to install, and I love the tilt feature. The best part was knowing I got it for 50% less than the price at a big electronics store in our area! We're very pleased with this product..and the price paid."
3,Good but...,"Good quality mount however the supplied mounting bolts broke when running them into the wall! Be sure to buy better lag bolts from a hardware store: Lowes, etc before starting to install. Otherwise, pretty easy."
1,mostly problems,"This sander has some fatal flaws -1. There are a few pieces of this sander that stick down below the sand paper (part of the plastic housing, and the rubber tab on the dust bag). Both are a problem and need to be altered in order to use the sander on a flat surface or they will catch, skew the sander, and leave a nasty scour in the wood. The part of the housing that sticks down is a raised border for the serial #. WTH?2. The sandpaper spool tracking adjustment is very small and doesn't hold. The sandpaper frequently just shoots off the sander. This may have something to do with #1. I have used 3 different brands of sanpaper w/ the same results.3. The speed adjustment is on the handle, so it has to be taped in place or it changes as you grip and move the sander. After 4 or 5 half days of use my tape slipped and my hand turned the sander up to 3 (out of 6). A few minutes later, it caught fire and now it is in the Dewalt hospital awaiting a diagnosis."
1,Stereotypical Image,I don't like how they made Jade up for the Slumber party edition. I think she looks funny and somewhat stereotyped.
4,Rather like a fairy tale,An enjoyable book- different from LM Montgomery books in some ways- sweet. And with a typical fairy tale happy ending.
5,Fabulous read!,"This is another of LM Montgomery's masterpieces. The characters come to life as you read through the pages, you can almost hear their voices. My very favorite book of all time that I read, and read again."
4,You get the book and that is all,"I love this book and LM Montgomery as an author. this copy is oddly shaped and absolutely nothing more than the original text. No author's note, just text beginning on page 1 and ending the page before the back cover. Awfully pricey for the bare bones, but a great read for all ages."
4,A very interesting read...,"This book is easy to read and very interesting, in my opinion. There are a few things I don't like about it, however. Valancy Stirling, the ""old maid"", is usually submissive to her mother and everyone else. But one day, when she finds out that her life is slipping away and she can do nothing to stop it, she decides to do whatever she wants. She goes to work at a sick lady's house where a frank and uncivilized man nicknamed ""Roaring Abel"" stays. That is also where gets to know Barney Snaith... The story has a few good twists in it, which I always love. And Valancy finally finds her ""Blue Castle"" which she had daydreamed about. Overall, it is a good book, and I enjoyed it even with its faults."
2,"Maybe I expected too much, but...","I read the reviews for this book and immediately ordered it, but I was incredibly disappointed at this book's cliches, and overall unbelievability. It was occasionally entertaining, but the end was predictable and dragged out. True, we should all aspire to be a free spirit like Valancy, but a free spirit should be ORIGINAL too. To me this book's only interest was that it gave a rare look into LM Montgomery's thoughts."
2,Check your plyer first,I got the HD dvd Blue Planet. We have a Sony large screen HD TV and a Sony HD DVD player. Sorry-this DVD does not work on our equipment. The TV and player are 3 years old. I bought this disc on Amazon about a year ago but just now tried to play it. The darn thing should play but a disclaimer in the disc jacket states that some players may need to have software or firmware upgraded to work. The player's LCD window states that the disc can neither be played or written to. I checked on Sony's customer support and there are no updates for this player- RDRGX315 sony HD DVD reader/player. So beware. Be sure your player will play this type of disc or has capability to be updated. I am disgusted with the whole DVD scene.
2,Too Short and Too Old,"The Blue Planet is a beautiful viewing but not worth the money for only 40 min of film. It is good enough for repeat watch. Max price should of been about $15.00.The second film, A Dream is Alive, was made in 1985 and is way outdated. This was a year before the Challenger explosion. Not worth watching."
2,Bleh. I fell asleep.,"My husband got this for Christmas from a family member, and while excited at first to see images, I was put out by the toneless narrator, and felt like it was an elementary/junior high science class. Some of the images were stunning, but like what other people were saying I saw some dirt on the picture for the blu-ray release. Not as high quality as I was expecting, really. I think we would have rather received the Planet Earth series, starting with the ocean one. That may have been more interesting. I am still scratching my head why this was considered a Christmas gift choice since neither my husband or I watch documentaries except on Discovery or History Channel, and we already get those in HD. I say skip it."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,Certain reviewers say you can't go wrong with this picture and then proceed to talk about it only in techinological terms. Of course I suppose that's because that's the whole of their attention span.Like most IMAX drive 'movies'; a bloody bore
2,Competent but focused on producing consumers instead of phonics.,"I had the advantage of renting both this and Leapfrog: Letter Factory one after the other, and the differences are stark. Leapfrog: Phonics Farm has catchy songs, bright colorful characters, and a plot.... that are devoid of learning material. And some bits about phonics thrown in there for the parents. When me and my son finished watching this one, my son kept humming the theme song (about the leapfrog branded characters) and couldn't remember anything about actual letters.On the other hand, after we watched Leapfrog: Letter Factory, my son couldn't stop quoting, ""Is this the 'E' room""? to me. (Appropriate response: Ehhh??"".In short, if you're looking for a Leapfrog DVD about phonics, get the Letter Factory and leave this one alone. Where the Letter Factory is about teaching letters, this DVD is about getting kids hooked on Leapfrog DVDs. (on the other hand, DO buy Letter Factory - it's freaking brilliant.)"
3,Oops...,"I give this an extra star because it made my three-year-old laugh out loud. Not sure why, but the silly animations really tickled her. I bought this by mistake, intending to get Letter Factory (as recommended by several friends), but Amazon Instant Video only offered PHonics Farm and I got confused. We watched it, and I was slightly appalled that the letters, sounds, and animations are presented as a pre-READING skill yet the names of the animals are not written out. So you see ""Aa"" and then an alligator comes out and says he's an ""athletic alligator"" but the screen never spells alligator. This is the most simple literacy requisite. It doesn't matter how young the children are; it is always useful to provide the name in writing when presenting sounds/signs/images for little ones. Especially when the material is intended to help READ. Duh Leap Frog. Disappointed."
1,NOT AN OBVIOUS TOOL,"EVEN AFTER TRYING TO USE THIS TOOL, I AM LEFT WONDERING WHAT IT DOES AND WHY I WOULD NEED IT?"
2,"A suprisingliy tepid read with little meat. Yeah, and ????","A two trick pony - bob and bitch. Hyped as gossipy, revealing, titilating but at the same time thorough, ""Anna Wintour"" delivered on none of the above. Sure she's a bitch. Sure she has a bob. Sure sure sure. We knew that walking in. And ???? Maybe because I'd read ""The Devil Wears Prada"" I was prepared for the personality but still, this seemed very thin. As the old joke says, ""It's just like the plains, you keep driving and nothing ever happens."" Quoting everybody's veiw on the personalilty doesn't explain why the success, what really happens to make a magazine successful, why does it work. Generally a biography gives you some insight on the industry of the subject but I know little more about fashion, publishing, etc than I did before I picked up the book. There's no real meat on the (however scrawny) bone."
3,"anna, tour de force","front Row, Anna Wintour, the book is a bit too long and repetetive,a tighter storyline would make it more interesting"
2,"Not as good as ""Devil Wears Prada""","This book is slightly boring. If you want to read about a spoiled neurotic woman, this book is for you! I had trouble finishing it."
2,Rather pathetic...,"Though I am not a Vogue reader, I picked up this book out of curiosity to see what Anna W's splashes in the tabloids were all about.While the subject is only mildly interesting to me, the author's prose reads like a 300+ page deposition against Anna Wintour from everybody who had/has a major or minor gripe with her. It's a heavy and boring read.Gossip, if one can get over oneself and admit that it is entertaining, should remain light and diverting. In this book, it is difficult to garner much sympathy for the subject or its author, much less derive the slightest enjoyment from it. I was very happy to put it down.Perhaps this lackluster effort will compel someone else to attempt a better job. But then again, when that time comes, Anna Wintour may be have disappeared completely from public interest."
4,Nice book,"Not that Anna Wintour is such an interesting person, but the author writes a nice biography. He does a good job, interesting details. However, I probably expected more ""glitz"". I recommend the book."
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on...,"Give me a break. Jerry Oppenheimer is one of those ""unauthorized"" biographers who extrapolates and dramatizes, adding his own skewed agenda all along the way. I couldn't stand his writing (especially his creating thoughts for Ms. Wintour as a child!) and wish there was an actual, trustworthy and unbiased biography of this visionary, if demanding, stylemaker."
5,One of my most used Ana and Ravi DVDs,"I have had Ultimate Stretch Workout for a few years now and continue to use it regularly. There are lots of forward bending poses (seated and standing), which I find both invigorating and very relaxing. However, people who don't enjoy hamstring stretches might not feel the same way I do!My other 'most used' Kundalini DVDs are:*Yoga Beauty Body (IMO the perfect yoga practice)*Dance the Chakras*Lose Weight & Feel Great*Total Tune-up (one of Ana's first DVDs - the music's not great but I love the yoga sets)*AM-PM Yoga (awesome AM set)*Yoga Quick Fixes (I actually prefer Dr Yoga House Call, but I love the mini sets in Quick Fixes)."
3,A medium-good date movie,"This is one of the most ""medium"" movies I've seen. No real controversy (good girls versus bad guys), no nudity (a real missed opportunity there), no comedic bits that are either really funny or really stupid (there's one scene where Minnie tries to hide a gun in her bra, but the metal's so cold she drops it).You could watch this with a new date and just relax, talk some, watch some, no pressure.Two young women, a nurse and an actress, overhear a robbery in progress and, deciding that their lives could use some new spice (and new money), try to blackmail the crooks into sharing the loot.The characters (nurse-actress-bad guys) are all easily recognized ""types,"" the setting is England but doesn't really have to be (except it's kind of funny listening to the American ""actress"" do her British accent).Keep your expectations low, and this movie is fine."
3,smells like christianity,"I discovered Ron Sexsmith through his last CD ""Blue Boy"" and I absolutely loved it. His style was so unique that I began listening to his older music, it was hit and miss, I liked some, some I didn't. Needless to say, when I saw Cobblestone Runway in the store I immediately bought it (without hearing any of the tracks I snatched it up). I have listened to it three times and am disapointed, the originality that I heard in Blue Boy seamed to be gone and replaced with blandness and on top of that, he seams to have gotten christianity, (or maybe he always had it and I hadn't noticed) Anyway, for the hardcore fans, I'm sure you will enjoy it, for the rest, you may want to let this fish go."
2,"Dull pictures, some out of focus","While there are some good pictures in the book, many are dull (as if the film wasn't processed properly) and some are out of focus. Also, many pictures run across two pages, with the middle of the book obscuring the subject of the picture. For example, there is a picture of Bill Clinton hugging someone who had lost her firefighter husband. The center of the book runs straight through the back of the woman's head and part of Clinton's face."
3,Interesting yet average book.,"(Mostly) quite good photos, (some) of them really excellent like Mr. Hoepker's stuff, wow -- but no original point of view here. Professional but structurally contrived book without a personal touch I would expect from those talented folks at Magnum. Hey, what about photo intros by Mr. Meiselas and Mr. Towell? Their stories do not reconcile -- where's the truth? In a nutshell: this is a solid, honest but quite average photo book. A robust C+."
1,Shameless,"Shameless. I cannot believe that in this time where both the TV community and Hollywood have both restrained themselves in a noteworthy fashion that the publishing industry would stoop to such a level. This is only one of the growing number of publications coming out to cash-in on the tragedy. If I only had enough time on my hands to review all of these ""insta-books"" on the September 11 attacks... Oh, and though it's a nice gesture to donate part of the proceeds to a related charity, it's still all too blatant exploitation. We aren't all suckers, though P.T. Barnum's quote rings true just by looking at today's Amazon ranking... #1. Shameless."
3,another workbook,"I use many handouts with my clients and there are some in this book that I will copy and use. Overall, I like the format. The author introduces ways in which you can use the information, and has the worksheets printed a s such that they are easy to copy. Some I anticipate using a lot, others don't interest me, but this is how I view most workbooks...not everything works for you or your clients. The floppy that is included is useless since I don't know many people who can use them with their computers. Overall, I am glad to add it to my collection."
3,Its okay,Pat is not in this game. Its just Vanna with a lot of encouraging messages as you play. Its a pretty lackluster game.
3,Wheel of Fortune Review,"This game was okay. It was fun, but the puzzles weren't as challenging as they could and the wheel lands on Bankrupt A LOT!!"
4,It's good old school pop-punk,"In the vein of the Buzzcocks and dickies comes the The undertones with their songs about growing up, teenage life and girls. They where their pop-punk badge proudly on their sleeves and do a pretty good job of it. Not as good as the above mentioned bands but they do have some super catchy songs."
4,I'd rather they were in Philadelphia...,"Gregor and Bennis are bacK, and so is Jane Haddam's deft prose. No one fleshes out characters better than she - the twins in this novel are prime examples. They're so real they hurt. Story good, writing good - but I really prefer Gregor when he is in his element, on Cavanaugh St. with Tibor and George and Donna and the Ararat Restaurant. As an urban ethnic, I love that part of the books - the custom and ritual and general insanity that we eths bring to everyday life in the city."
5,Intelligent and satisfying,"I've just discovered the Gregor Demarkian series and SKELETON KEY is definitely the book that will make me go back and read the earlier ones. Vivid characters, an intricate yet coherent plot, and a totally likable hero are all the ingredients that make mystery lovers sigh with pleasure. Not to be missed by those who appreciate a crackling good story."
4,A great Dio recording . . .,"There's a real energy to Magica that most Dio naysayers would never believe could be there. But, it is . . .Although I'm not interested in the conceptual robot-voice interludes and Dio's long reading of the Magica story at the CD's end, I do think that this recording nearly stands up to Dio's early output. Most of the songs are full of interesting twists and progressions, and Goldy's guitar playing is very tasteful (AND his tone is immaculate).Magica is a fine release. Dio's voice is in top form. I would think that any fan of his early releases would love this one."
2,"Where's the ""magic?""","I've been a fan of RJD since the old Sabbath days. I liked his stuff more than any singer they had. But those days are long gone. Although it would be hard to do much better than Holy Diver or The Last In Line, this just doesn't come close. He can still sing, but the music just isn't there. Craig Goldy is no Vivian Campbell, heck, he's not even Glen Campbell. The tracks are often slow and boring. The best song is probably Fever Dreams, but it can't carry the cd alone. Don't get me wrong, the cd's not totally boring, you can always listen to one of the two reprises or be read to for 18+ minutes on ""Magica Story"". Sorry, not much magic here, just a disappearing act."
2,DIO is back - feeding from the mainstream,"Dio is back.. but is this good? Yeah, musically it is. The band is tight, strong and straight to the point. But what about the lyrics ? Dio's lyrics were also horrible, no meaning at all. Now, he take a ride in the fashion stablished by European bands who talks about RPG characters and fables, like Blind Guardian, Hammerfall and Rhapsody. The result: the lyrics are still bad."
2,Hard to walk in...,"These boots have 5"" heels, and the seller described it as having 3"" heels. It was very hard to walk in because the boots have very little to no bend. I ended up returning and getting a similar product with 3"" heels by Pleaser."
4,This game is very cool.,This game is very challenging and fun. It does get very hard real quick and for rookie gamer like me that has been a struggle. I enjoy the game and have ordered a gaming guide to help me through the levels.
5,Great Song,"At first i hated this song and i thought it was corny, it took me a while to get used to and then i relized its a great song. I realized this song is supposed to be corny its makeing because d12 is makeing fun of boy bands. Its a great song because its hillarious. It always makes me laugh. Give this song a chance and you may find it hillarious 2!GO D12"
2,Extremely overrated,"Now, I AM an Eminem fan, but I just can't get into this song. I know it's supposed to be silly, but it still doesn't sit right with me, especially that chorus. And by the way, it's really painful to hear Eminem kicking wack verses, because I didn't think that was possible (but did anyone hear that song ""Hands On You"" off Obie Trice's album?). And it's not that nobody knows about the people in the group -- it's that nobody CARES about the people in the group. They can't rap. (In fact, I think Bizarre gets wacker every day). I'm not sure I'll be taking a trip to D12 World.Anthony Rupert"
5,The best graphic novel ever,"This is the best graphic novel ever, I have read many graphic novels for many years now. I do say this is the best no matter where your back round is."
4,Good reference,This is concise and easy-to-use reference. I am a teacher and an editor. This has been helpful in quick order.
1,This Beautiful Ballerina should stay in her box.,"What a disappointment. My daughter (age 4) HAD to have this doll after viewing the commercial...and after only about 15 minutes playing with the doll, she said - I don't like this and threw it to the side. Meanwhile, my husband was using the box outside to change the oil in his car!! so I couldn't return it to the store.What can I say, except it is a very dull, uneventful doll.The ballet stand is flimsy (and the doll can't even grip onto it). My opinion: HUGE WASTE OF MONEY."
3,"good, but not worth the amount of money spent","I like this toy becuse it has a booklet that has ballet terms and positions, but the doll itself is kind of cheap. The hair plugs show, the legs don't bend, and she isn't THAT well made."
4,Pretty Decent,"I wouldn't say it's the best hard wax around, but it really does get the job done, although I feel that other waxes stick less to the skin after you remove it. I would recommend it, but I find it a bit more painful to use than other hard waxes."
3,GiGi Brazilian Hard Wax,"I'm having an incredibly hard time with this product! It makes the biggest mess I've ever seen...takes my nail polish off as I try to pick it off. From what I've read, it takes some practice to get the knack but it is frustrating in the meantime. Customer service from this site was excellent."
2,Hard Wax,"This product is not bad however, I bought it so I could wax without strips and not have to go to the salon every month and spend over $50.00 for 1 session, when I could do the same for less at home. Well, it was a bit messy and certain areas like my legs (one would think would be the most simple area of waxing) were complex. Overall, if you're a pro, you'll love the product, if you're a novice like me, you may need to go back to the salon."
4,yeah sure,"Took me some time to perfect the technique. Like the other reviewers say, if you don't wait for the right consistency it will dry too hard and flake or will come off in a gooey mess, both situations equally messy and painful. Me personally, I have coarse hair: I use it for waxing everything and the bikini. Not brazillian; tried it once and it's too risky to try again down there <^_^>"
3,Different Prices for same item,"On the first page for this item, it states:Fuji SVHS-C 30-Minute Tape (SVHSTC30)List Price: $16.99Amazon.com's Price: $3.99You Save: $13.00 (77%)Yet when I click on the item, it shows that I only have a ""new-used"" choice for $10.30 for each tape. How do I get the $3.99 price? Confusing."
4,Useful handbook,"I bought this because I already owned the superb Boston's Gun Bible which is stuffed full of mostly irreproachable tips on weapons ownership.It's hard to critique this book, however. In fact, I hope I never need to know any of this stuff. I'm betting it will come in handy and that I will regret not having fully assimilated its concepts. As I'm a geek and not exactly a people person, I would have considerable trouble finessing some of the social situations (i.e.: interaction with government employees) discussed in here.Looks good, however. The lack of the fifth star is a) because I can't judge the quality and b) I probably can't do some of what is suggested."
5,Wish I'd had this book years ago!,"Until I'd read You & The Police!, I had no idea how little I knew about my rights. Have already used this book's info during a traffic stop with a snoopy police officer who (without any reason) wanted to search my trunk. I asked what he was searching for, and he got all flustered without answering. (You should have seen his face!) He then said in a stern voice, ""So, you're refusing consent of a search?"" and I replied, ""That's right, I am. There's nothing in my car to interest the police. Can I go now?"" He stomped off to his unit, muttering for me to keep my speed down, and drove off! He didn't even ticket me! I'd say this book has already paid for itself. Don't leave home without it!"
5,Buy this book now.,"The revised/updated book by Mr Royce,"" You and the Police"" is an absolute must read. In no uncertain terms he tells you how to stand your ground constitutionally when dealing with LEO's. I am sending a copy to each of my children and to my brother. My wife needs to read this too. I'll keep my copy next to my first aid kit in my car!"
3,Good book but incomplete,"This book is useful an a very general sense. It talks about what sort of attitude's are a help or not.But it could be more specific when talking about what is or is not one of your rights. Also, giving specific sources for more research would be helpful."
3,It's okay,"This book has some great information, but is overly wordy and the author seems to be a bit full of himself."
1,Only buy if your completly clueless,"This book really has no good information. The author considers themselves an expert on police because they are friends with cops and they even side with them in this book. A cop needs RAS, reasonable articulable suspicion to ticket/search you. Other than that keep your mouth shut take your ticket. This is the extent of the info in this book. Oh, besides building a strong box in your trunk. This book really stinks."
4,"Very good antenna for High Definition broadcast, good price","Bought this as a gift for a friend with a new 52"" LED HD TV. Helped him install it and get the tv set up for station scanning. We both live in the same town and are almost exactly the same distance from the broadcast towers we receive 8 stations from. I was very impressed with the tv quality he was receiving compared to my older antenna on my LED HD TV. I'm putting one of these on my own shopping list before football season starts! :-)P.S. Before all our stations went totally digital and high def we had half of them still broadcasting analog signals over translators and even those channels were superior in quality compared to the performance of my own old antenna."
4,Very good antenna for HD TV,"The antenna was very easy to set up, and it has improved my TV reception to the point where I do not need cable anymore. We get every channel available in the area, and this is even with the antenna mounted in my attic! Good value for the money. I would recommend this product."
1,This book was not good,"I bought the book in hardcover, and it was a waste of money. I don't know how to go about telling what specifically is wrong with the book, it is just uninteresting and not at all exciting. The final climax is rediculous."
4,thank the maker! no more superweapons!,"I liked this book. I think it's great to have a Star Wars book without another Death Star or Sun Crusher or a ton of Star Destroyers. I liked how there was action from page one. I also liked the idea about them getting new identities, but they have to work a little better on it. Luke made me mad during the book. I didn't think he would be that weak after being a Jedi for so long. Han was a different kind of heroic than I was used to him being. I enjoyed Tigris's relationship with Hethrir (which was brainwash) and Anakin's relationship with Tigris(which was braking the brainwash). Jacen and Jaina were okay, but it bugged me that Jaina was so concerned about breaking her parent's rules. I liked how they escaped and they're bluntness. I would recommend this book, it's a pageturner."
1,I would have given it a 0.,"This has got to be the worst Star Wars book ever.I swear it was a chore reading it.The characters acted nothing like the ones we have come to love(i.e.Luke manipulating his image in Han's mind),they felt like total strangers!The description sounded good,the book could've been good, alas it sucked.Keep away from this book.It will feel like you are doing a chore reading it;save your time and go read a Zahn or Anderson novel."
1,Perhaps the worst Star Wars novel published to date,"This book was simply horrible. The story was just plain bad, and the writing was poor. I don't know how Bantam and Lucasfilm Licensing ever let this book get published. I've read almost every single novel ever published, and this one is has to rank near the very bottom."
2,"i GIVE this a 2 is for the cover art, only.","Cover art was awsome, if it wasnt for that i would have GIVEN it a 1 wich is sorry to say the lowest it can go, it deserves a 0.5 . The story sucked. It took me three months to read this thing. It's 413 pages full of bull. This one was worse than darksaber, wich at least you can trick yourself into thinking it was good. This was bad, flat out bad. I burned this one."
2,Doesnt Have the Star Wars Magic!,It could Have been so much better! The idea was great but the writing stunk! Doesnt have the Star Wars magic!
1,What a bunch of wimps!,"This book did not continue the Star Wars tradition. The characters were whiny instead of strong and the action was laughable. I was very disappointed in the way the author portrayed the familiar characters as weaklings. The Star Wars characters are ""people"" of action, but all they did here was mope about the things that were going wrong. Luke and Leia would never blame their troubles on others, nor would they wait to be ""rescued."" I'm glad that other women authors have done a better job of interpreting the familiar characters. Otherwise, readers would assume this is the way all females write science fiction."
1,this is the worst star wars book available,"ridiculous plot, dull characters, dumba** presuppositions, no explanations and pathetic attempts at grandeur do not a good book make."
1,This book sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is horrid. I'd have given it a 0 but there wasn't any on the scale. I felt like tearing the book up when I was done, except it was a library one. Luke did not act like Luke. He was stupid & whiney & got taken in by that Waru blob. I mean, HE IS A JEDI KNIGHT!! Does the author not know what that means? & it felt like Luke was falling to the Dark side . He walked around yelling at everyone. Does that seem like a Jedi to you?? Han was a stupid gambling idiot. I could go on forever..."
5,This book RULES!,"First of all, whoever said women can't write Star Wars books is WRONG! This book was awesome! Hethrir seemed really evil! I couldn't put this book down. Read it!!!!"
3,"At Best, It's Mediocre. . . But Hey, It's STAR WARS!","My review is above. In this space are some questions I have for Vonda N. McIntyre. One: why is this book more like Star TREK than Star WARS? Two: exactly what was the extent of that power that Hethrir hoped to tap into through Waru? Was it just a little bit more Force energy? Or was it a portal directly into the Force, through which he could take control of it? Or was it some intangible power beyond even the Force? Three: are Firrerrians (I hope I spelled that right) human, or just humanoid? I hope you can somehow respond by commenting on your book through the Internet. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING, MS. McINTYRE."
3,Do I feel a YAWN coming on??,"The book itself was OK, but some of it was SO slow! The parts with the kids were good (however slow) and insightful, but other developments were TOO slow. Still a must-read for all you live-or-die Star Warriors."
2,Is this for 3rd Graders?,"This is like one of those 20 page SW books enhanced to 400. Everything is just laid out nothing is left for you to discover. Aside from the reading level allthe action if that's what you want to call is at the end.Another thing Luke is a wimp just like in Barbera Hambly's book. Last time I checked Chewbacca had above normal healing abilities.This got two stars, because if your're really young this book will be good. Other than that Mcintyre just messed up the SW characters and universe."
1,DISGUST.,Those who liked this must either be lunatics or 8 year olds who never saw SW movies. The typical result of an idiotic trekkie woman trying to meddle with the star wars universe
5,Love this!,"Not only does this take away one more thing from your sink counter, but you can fill a lot more soap in it then the average dispenser. It is easy to fill, looks great and I am really happy with it. Of course I have only had it for two months, but I have to say it works great.06/07/10 update: Still think this is great. Sometimes I overfill it, but oh well, still worth it!"
5,Very Nice,Much nicer looking in person. Have had it for a cople of weeks and so far no problems. I searched a long time for a reasonable priced soap dispenser (needed a longer spout and had to fit a think deck) that went with my SS Grohe faucet (matching Grohe one was 2x as much and had bad reviews). This one is perfect.
5,Heartbreak Made Beautiful,"Brendan Gamble has created a beautiful and honest album filled with so much heart and feeling, that at times it feels like you're snooping through his private journal, not listening to an album made for public listening. It would be embarrassing if it were not so beautifully executed. Gamble's voice, a simple yet fitting vehicle for his thoughtful lyrics, is brought to life by quietly balanced acoustic instrumentation and horn flourishes. I certainly hope Heartless Moon was as theraputic for him to make as it is heartbreakingly gorgeous to listen to."
2,Don't waste your time. Get Winning Eleven 6 instead.,"FIFA 2003 was decent, until Winning Eleven 6 came and blew it out of the water. Great graphics, great sound, but poor gameplay and the dumbest artificial intelligence for teammates I've seen in a long time. Also, if you have a lead, all you need to do is simply stand there, as the computer won't challenge you unless you move.Another poor effort from EA's soccer department.They have a long way to go to catch up to Konami."
4,Does the Job,"As expected of a book in the Time Life family, this provides a good overview for the layman. In simple language it gives you what you need to know with beautiful glossy illustrations.The style is corporate. It reads as though a committee of editors pruned all personality from the text. Being a 1966 title, when there were still editors who actually edited, this is probably true.It was just what I needed to bring together the slivers of information on the time that I've acquired from more specialized books. I recommend it for others general readers who need an overview."
1,Very flimsy,"I have bought resisitance bands with a variety of strengths in one package in the past, and thought that MEDIUM would be like those in the previous package. This MEDIUM resistance was very flimsy and offered little resistance. Since most companies sell packages with a variety of resistances, and I found that I liked the MEDIUM, I was happy to find that this company was selling just one type in a package. I was very disppointed that I had to send it back. Now I'm wondering if I should order the HEAVY resistance.Thera-Band 6ft Red Medium Resistance Exercise Band Latex Bands - 6 ft length - Polybag"
2,"Stay away, really, just dont....","I don't really know what to say about this movie other than it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it comes close. If you are one of the artsy fartsy people who like to find meaning in movies that just don't make sense, than this is for you. If that isn't you, just stay away."
3,A Minor Masterpiece,"I first saw this movie in the early 1980's and was pretty shocked then as a college student. Looking at it now I can see why. This movie, to clear one thing up, was made with the AUTHOR's blessing and contribution, as is made clear from the included booklet. I believe it is an accurate appraisal of that time in very symbolic terms. A similar treatment of WWII and its immediate aftermatch would be the book, The Painted Bird by Kosinski. Also, like that book, it is filled with sex paired with violence, and many nauseating images. So it is not at all easy to watch, but as a film buff I appreciate a good bit of it.Stay clear away if you are easily disturbed. If you miss this you will not miss a masterpiece. It is well done, and Criterion's treatment of it is, as always, quite stunning."
3,Exquisite but degrading,"At times exquisitely filmed, at times hideous to watch; there were several moments when I attempted to look away from the film, as the material on the screen was too repulsive to watch. To know that such acts of despair and horror actually might exist is enough to throw one into a fright of existential depression. In particular, the one scene when one of the husbands grips the decapitated head of a boar, and pulls still-alive wriggling eels out from its slimy mouth, and then subsequentely serves the eels for breakfast the next morning. Probably not a film I will watch again, yet glad to have been through the experience. I do hope they do not make more films like this though."
5,Laughing is better than craying,"A clever provocative movie is not for moralists surely for a mix of paedophilic moments depicted on a landscape of the late ninetieth - the imminent end of the WWII in Ganza Zud-Dauche territories (Gdansk, Poland's Baltic region recently).It is better one time to watch than fifty-plus times to read about."
1,Not a Lucas hater - just a bad film.,"Let's face it folks character development does matter. I'm not talkin Henry Jaglom here (Plot matters too Henry) but Lucas spends way too much time trying to create a self-consciously mythic narrative (A mistake! Joseph Campbell & Jung were wrong George!) while feeding us characters of cardboard. The characters need to be more personalized because, despite what some Star Wars fans think, these films ain't gospel."
1,Christenson deserves a razzie award,"The acting by Hayden Christenson and Natalie Portman completely ruined the movie for me. No, I was not expecting outstanding performances by them, but I've seen more believable acting by first graders in school plays compared to the leads of Episode 2. There was not 1 scene in the movie where I believed that Padme and Anakin were in love. They had absolutely no chemistry together. Natalie Portman was just flat and emotionless while Christenson was seemed like he was reading his lines off a teleprompter. A few of their scenes were actually laughable. The rest just put me to sleep. I'm not familiar with Christenson's work, but Natalie Portman has done great work in her short career. Let's hope this problem gets fixed in time for episode 3."
5,Just plain excellent,"I have been a fan of ""Star War"" for the long term, seeing the original immediately following its release (21 times in the theater; does this make me a bit of a fanatic??) This does not mean that I have loved all episodes equally and, after reading a number of reviews that criticised this installment, I was not expecting to enjoy this one as much as I did. Why do I bother listening to critics? I loved it and find that it lived up to my expectation of this epic masterpiece. I think that Lucas' casting for Anakin was nothing short of inspired. This worthy actor gave a real depth to his character and certainly showed us where the danger lies for the final episode when Anakin becomes Darth.I am glad that Lucas has returned to his glorious universe while both of us were still around to make/enjoy his creation! There was a time when I did not believe I'd get to see ""the rest of the story"". It was well worth the wait! Thank you, George."
2,Disappointed in the acting and story line..,"As a Star Wars admirer it seems that the acting and story line is becoming secondary to the special effects. The special effects are absolutely amazing and the quality of the DVD is incredible.However, without the story line to hold it together it seems more like a video game. I kept thinking these actors really have a challenge trying to have a dialogue with a blue screen and it's really starting to show in the films. The editing is very choppy and that might contribute the lack of flow...Oh well..at least I was there for the beginning..."
1,Egads! Attack of the senses!,My god what a awful movie! Save your money and buy something useful. Or if you're adamant on seeing this movie take the money you've saved and buy yourself a labotomy which consequently will be better than the movie.
1,STAR BORES 2: ONE OF THE WORST FILMS EVER MADE!!!,"If Mr. Lucas wants folks to sit for 2 1/2 hours in the theater watching one of his ""epics"", it would be nice if next time he had some kind of story to go along with all the ho-hum FX. This movie is SO... BORING, if your having trouble sleeping at night, buy this DVD when it comes out, pop it in the DVD player, lay down and watch it and I guarentee it will put you to sleep within 5 minutes. Without doubt one of the WORST FILMS EVER MADE!"
2,Not good,"Even though there are a cool couple of scenes in this movie, overall its terrible. The acting and dialogue ruin the whole film. Hopefully Episode III can bring some redemption to Episodes I and II."
2,Where are Harisson Ford and Cheewy !!!!,"Wow,A waste of money. I gave 2 stars because it is a little better than the Phantom Menace.A lot of cheezy parts, the main actor is terrible....bottom line : I miss the old Star Wars !!!"
3,Staar Wars Episode III,"In my opinion, this was the worst of The Star Wars series, incl. the last one, that I just saw in the theatre. Of course it is beyond words in how it was filmed, etc./ etc., I just didn't enjoy the story line. It's a personal thing."
2,May the Schwartz be with you,"You know the thing can't be too good when you are happy, yes actually happy to see Jar Jar Binks. I may have actually burst a vessle trying to hold in a case of the giggles. The problem with this movie is that it is trying to be sophisticated with all of it's political mumbo jumbo speak but it doesn't have the actors that could pull it off. I am sorry but that kid just ain't Darth Vader.p.s. I smell a best actor oscar for Jar Jar."
2,Ouch!!!,"This movie was a bit better than The Phantom Menace but not much. It's hurt by the two problems of the first movie: too much time on special effects and not enough the characters. The effects are really cool and all but they didn't save the film from disaster. The characters are really boring (not to mention the acting is really bad) in this movie and the story is kinda complex. Unless you wanna watch a load of CGi, then don't bother with this film."
2,Anakin needs more training,"I understand that Lucas has to get a new face for the Anakin role so this person/actor will not overshadow the character with his fame. But please, you have to get someone who knows how to act. Episode 2 plays a very important pivotal role for Anakin Skywalker turning to Darth Vader. The audience has to be able to see that brewing change but still not strip them of their sympathy for the Dark Lord. It centered on Anakin/Padme's love story instead. Such a waste of time & money. I could have just skipped this & proceed with the Episode 3. On second thoughts, I may just skip it altogether if it comes out like this film. Mr. Lucas, I hope you are listening!!!"
4,A bit confusing,"The biggest attractive of the movie are the Jedis, we finally see them really in action, and we see plenty of them from different wordls. The love scenes make of this movie a bit heavy, and combats a bit confusing. Wasn't Anakin too young for Amidala? And why a fight between combat robots and Clone troopers? I don't understand that."
1,Lucas must be banished!,"""There will be no burning here today! We will banish him!"" A cute line from ""Highlander."" It is quite appropriate for the current state of Star Wars affairs."
1,The worst Star Wars film ever,"I know I'm gonna be hated after this review but I found AOTC to be very boring.Even though the action scenes were awesome and Yoda's lightsaber duel was spectacular,I found the love story to be dull and boring.I was really looking forward to seeing this movie in the theater when it came out.I've been a Star Wars fan all my life and I was greatly dissapointed in this movie.I hope episode three is better."
3,"5 Star DVD, 1 Star Movie","The MovieAttack of the Clones features laughable acting, horrible dialogue, a boring plot, non-developed characters, beautiful scenery and breathtaking special FXThe DVD6 hours of extras! The DVD has deleted scenes that give more depth to Padme's character and the trailers show what the movie COULD have been. Buy it just for the DVD"
3,Could have been so much more!!!,"This film really was a let down to me. I have been a fan of all things Star Wars since I saw the first film and this film had the potential to be so much more. I think what killed it is Lucas jamming everything into one film what realistically could have been it's own trilogy. He wasted so much time on the romance between Anakin and Padme that it played out like soap opera in space!It was also disappointing to have such a hyperkinetic lightsaber duel in Episode One between Obi-Wan and Darth Maul only to have Christopher Lee digitally masked onto a stuntman and use inset shots to make it appear as if he is fighting Hayden Christiansen. Granted Lee is upwards towards his 80's, but it could have been filmed better.What I did like was the opportunity to see Yoda throw down! That was the payoff. My hope is that Episode Three will make me appreciate this one after the trilogy is over the same way ""The Empire Strikes Back"" seems better after watching ""Return of the Jedi"""
5,It's Going To Be Even Better Than Episode 1!,"""Star Wars Episode II"" will be even better than ""The Phantom Menace."" The storyline will be much darker than ""TPM"" and will be similar to ""The Empire Strikes Back."" Jar Jar has a very brief role- Yay! I don't even have to recommend this movie, since everyone is going to see it anyway. I know the story line for ""Episode 2"" and ""Episode 3"" but I dare not say it here."
3,Decent...,"Okay, lemme just start by saying that this is NOT the best Star Wars and it is NOT the best sci-fi movie, and it is NOT the best action movie. I like how they kind of explored the origin story of the storm troopers and Boba Fett, and I found the character of Dexter Jettster likable, and the fight between Yoda and Count Dooku was pretty great. But, there are just too many negative points to make this a great movie, those three positive points I just mentioned aren't enough to make it great (although that Yoda/Dooku fight, hmm...). The acting is just terrible by most of the actors/actresses, the script didn't help either. The whole thing with the death of Anakin's mother could have been a lot better. The music is Star Wars-y, so I guess that's good. Overall, this could have been a great movie, but it just suffered from too many negative points. It's decent at best. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
2,Big miss,"This movie has excellent special effects and some compelling visuals, but it proves that if you don't have a good story, a movie won't work. The story here was so convoluted and boring that I had trouble sitting for the whole two hours. I feel sorry for George Lucas because the original was so good, he's got an impossible act to follow. He should have stopped after the first three rather than producing these prequels that can't stand on their own."
2,Better than the Phantom Menace...,"To put this review in perspective, I should say that I bought this DVD strictly in an attempt to test the potential of my new entertainment system setup. Upon arriving at the final battle scene, my shameless goal was happily realized. However, the mundane tripe that I had to wade through before hand almost made the journey an unbearable one. While almost always pleasing to the senses, the movie had absolutely no substance... especially to justify a revisitation. Therefore, rent the DVD. However, be sure to enjoy and marvel at the efforts (documented nicely in the special features) the amazing talents at the ILM (arguably the only ones in this production) had put towards this film."
2,Yawn....,"Booooring.....Wasted my time with this one...Oops, sorry did I fall asleep?Seems I did, Oh well, I'm sure I didn't miss much ;)"
2,Wha???,"Ok, it's not horrible...but, jeez it's not worthy to be called Star Wars either. When Yoda is the best ""actor"" in the flick, you're in trouble. Boring, unbelievable love story. Wooden dialog...ugh!"
5,Extremely Awesome!,"I'll have to admit that after seeing Episode I, I didn't expect that much from this addition - what a surprise I was in for! This is a totally awesome, very artistically-made episode for the Star Wars saga.I won't go on about how much better it is than Episode I, but there is more drama, more action, and a great love story. Hayden Christensen is a GREAT actor. He amazed me, as did Natalie Portman (but I already expected a stellar performance from her).George Lucas has once again outdone himself on the greatest series of all time. I feel that this is the greatest music that John Williams has ever composed. The special effects actually seem real this time, and is not overdone as it is in Episode I.Take my words for it folks - do not miss a single minute of Episode II, and you will be anxiously awaiting Episode III. Thanks, George!"
1,Trash Wars,"I've been a Star Wars fan since the first movie, what is now called a ""New Hope"", came out in 1977. I was thirteen at the time. The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi were both great movies, very worthy successors to the original movie.I've just seen Attack of the Clones. It is one of the worst pieces of garbage I've ever seen. The acting, if you can call it that, was just plain bad. Dialog? Plot? Don't worry about stuff like that, this movie does not have any. It was like I was watching Friends.My four year old loved it. The thing was written for people with the mentality of a four year old.I've written far more than this dog deserves. Don't see it. It's bad.I rate this move -6."
1,"so bad, it's not even funny","it's just all around a disappointing moive. bad, horrendous acting and above all WEAK writing/directing. George needs to let someone else rescue this saga from it's death spiral."
3,"Not bad, Not Spectacular","I've had mixed feelings over this film. I am a Star Wars fan, perhaps not as much as others, but I definitely enjoy the series. Though I found many elements of this film tragic in their low level of quality (i.e. the dialogue and certain characters) it still resounded of the wonderful ideas that drove episodes 4-6. Visually, it was incredible. I thought the acting was actually good, but the dialogue stank of saturday morning cartoons. Hayden was as good as possible with what little he had to work with and the same goes for Natalie. A decent sci-fi flick for fans of sci-fi in general. I'd rent this first, and buy it if you love the visuals, otherwise, don't expect too much, he did, after all, write it with the help of his kids. Grow up George, your fans did."
5,The second best Star Wars movie!,Who cares what critics say? Or what fake star wars fans say. Behind Return of the Jedi this is the best one. The story was wonderful and the the film painted a beautiful picture of the star wars galaxy. The action was amazing and Yoda's fight scene vs. Doku was magnificent. It was a masterpiece all through out.
5,Great Movie,It was nice to find a great prices for a great movie that my whole family watched a lot!!!!!!!!! Yaah
3,Is Hayden's face...moving?,"Okay, first of all, I don't hate any of the Star Wars movies. However, Episode 2 has to be the worst. Yes, it has the awesome Yoda/ Dooku fight, and Jango Fett's decapitation, but what George Lucas doesn't seem to get is that we LIKED it when the special effects were average and the acting good. Now, it's like he's saying, ""Yeah, bad acting, but it's SO PRETTY! LASERS!""Anyway, acting aside, the effects are awesome, and everyone beside Hayden Christensen does a fairly good job with the lines written. Ewan McGregor is a clever Obi-Wan Kenobi, and now he has a beard, so he's wise. Samuel L. Jackson kicks bootay as Mace Windu, and Frank Oz has more emotion as the voice of Yoda than most of the cast.Maybe it's not all Hayden's fault. The lines written are already bad, so it would take a really great actor to deliver bad lines well. Overall, a good movie for fans. Luckily, Episode 3 was much better, living proof that Star Wars can somehow still be great with bad acting."
4,This movie ROCKED!!!,"In no way did I ever fill bored watching this movie. From the beginning to end, I was just mesmerized by the sheer beauty of the effect/backgrounds. Sure the dialogue wasn't upto &amp;quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;The Grapes of Wrath&amp;quot; standards, but it's just the myth of it all that's so capativating.It was a movie in which you can let go of the problems we're having here on Earth and just escape from them. I quess you would need to be a diehard Star Wars fan to understand where I'm coming from.Lucus in my opinion is a genius. He's up there with Speilberg, Ridley Scott and Cameron to name a few!I made a pre-order of this movie and believe me, when I have this in my hands, I would see it over and over again until my wife kicks me out of the house and lose my job and end up at the corner asking for money to by Star Wars Episode III."
1,Yuck!...,"The plot is not bad, the Digital Effects are OK, but for all the rest, all I can say is YUCK...!Unless you're a big fan of South-American soap-operas, I can't imagine you enjoying this movie.What a disgrace seeing Portman and McGregor acting with such poor dialogs (god I miss them from Leon & Trainspotting), as a result the whole movie can be shrinked out to 30 mn (plot and some battles), but here you get a 2 hrs bonus of useless scenes, love declarations, and deceptions.A friend of mine told me it was much better than Episode I (which made me sleep for about 1 hr), but I see Ep. II exactly the same.What happened to the George Lucas that created the first trilogy? I personally have no clue, but something did happen.I can deduce that this movie has been digitally directed too.PS: One positive thought about this movie, is when you follow it up with another movie (like I did with ""Hedwig & the angry inch""), then you'll find out and appreciate excellent directing."
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKED,"there are way too many holesthe acting is terrrrriblethere are so many scenes they shouldve jsut taken out because they were just THAT bad, for instance the love scenes were somewhat torture, because it was so acted without any emotion.Hoenstly i like the Star Wars trilogy, but strectching it to six doesnt seem like such a good idea anymore,A question I have is, though kinda nerdyIf the clones in SW 2 are suppose to be Jango Fett, shouldnt they all have equal fighting skills? I mean we are talking about one of the top bounty hunters in the 'galaxy' yet in 4,5, and 6 the stormtroopers get killed left and right.Hoenstly the entire clone thing is flawed, because in the 4th episode there are two stormtroopres talking about new bantha wheels or somethings..... but if they were clones shudnt they just shut their mouths and serve the empire?"
1,Cant recommend this one...,"I won't mention the acting, or the laughable love scenes. What I have a problem with in this film, and many others like lord of the rings, is the overuse of cgi's. I really think the older special effects from films like aliens, the original star wars, and others are so much more convincing than a cartoonish jumble of computer effects. For me, it destroys the illusion of the film because seeing the cgi instantly alerts me to the false nature of the picture I'm looking at. Now, in a movie like aliens, you really believe the alien is going to kill someone and that they are engaged in a real battle, because they are both on the screen and the actors are not just guessing at where the cgi is going to be standing in the film. Imagine how bad aliens would be if they replaced the aliens, and the mother alien, with cgi characters! Hope that makes sense."
3,Not enough plot,"Now that I have seen Episode III, I have figured out why Episodes I and II were bad. They had no plot. The prequels could have been narrowed down to two or even just one movie, but Lucas wanted the saga to be ""symetric"". As a result, for two movies we had a stretched out, wet paper bag plot."
2,Can we please have new actors?,"The original Star Wars movies were great. I liked those. But Episode I wasn't that great. I was hoping Episode II would be better but it was -remarkably- worse. Of course, the special effects were very nice, but even with the most impressive bells and whistles, you have to have a good story to back it up. And good actors to act it. But the acting... It's so stiff! Take Natalie Portman. Beautiful girl, would be great as a model. But the way she says her lines is just... awful. ""I truly... deeply... love you."" Most of the time she's speaking in a monotone. They should have gotten Keira Knightley. The chemistry between her and Anakin (Hayden Christensen) is... not there. They're either glaring at each other or sharing spit. Ah, well... maybe Episode III will be better."
1,A total WASTE,"Waste of time, waste of money, waste of... you name it. For all the Star Wars die hard fans out there, this movie is the biggest disappoinment ever, period. For the regular person who seeks to entertaint him/herself is way too long and too boring for even enjoy the CGI's. I just can't understand what was George Lucas thinking when making this movie, I just can't. A piece of advise, don't WASTE your precious money and time in here, if you watch Episode I and didn't like it, this one is way worse. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice..."
2,Glad I borrowed from library and didn't waste money,"Like the Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones was more about computer animation as opposed to a good storyline. I have seen better acting and writing for those cheesy Saturday morning shows. Plus, can someone explain to me why in the first two movies everything (ships, planets, landscapes, outfits, etc..) looks so crisp and clean, yet in IV, V, and VI things look much more real and gritty. I guess in Lucas time technology runs in reverse for the characters and their surroundings. I gave Attack of the Clones two stars instead of one because of the attempt to explain items for future events (albeit, a very poor job of doing it). To say this movie and the first one were huge disappointments, would be a huge understatement."
1,What a Rip,"Being a Star Wars fan from way back, I was really excited to go to this new movie. I was quickly surprised at the very poor acting and dialog! It never even occured to me that would ever be an issue in a Lucas film! The emotion and interaction was wooden and given with all the enthusiasm of Ben Stein! I can't believe the line ups and the 4 star review. Did the rest of you see a different movie than I did? I felt like I'd been hit with a bucket of cold water. The 5 other people that went with me to the show were equally, or more, disappointed."
4,"Better than Episode 1, but needs work","I found much to enjoy about Star Wars Episode II: the effects were dazzling, the fights were well choreographed, and it's a rollercoaster ride from beginning to end. But unfortunately, the characters weren't that interesting. In the original trilogy, the characters were fresh and involving, while now they're just actors in a Star Wars film. Not that that effects the movie badly, but would've made the movie better if the characters were more interesting (and maybe even developed). Better than Episode I, this should leave Star Wars fans dying to see Episode III."
2,I really can't believe that I paid money to see this . . .,"My wife kept having to nudge me to make sure that I was awake. She was angry that I had told her that this was supposed to be a romantic movie, as she felt that it was a lousy one, at best.Overall, Hayden Christiensen was a horrible choice for Anakin. His acting was absolutely aweful. And since the movie hinged upon him, that really hurt.Some scenes were good, like Obi-Wan's use of the force to make a drug-seller rethink his life, but these were far and few between in a sea of sludge.The best thing that I can say is that the movie picks up when they arrive in the arena. Unfortunately, this is about twenty minutes before the end and I don't think that twenty minutes out of a two and a half hour movie is a good thing upon which to spend my money.Yoda's lightsaber duel was really good, though . . ."
5,He proved he CAN do it!,"After the extreme disappointment of the Phantom Menace, George Lucas prove's he can still make damn good movies. Sure, this one still has some poorly-written dialogue, and some cheesy scenes. But, it makes up for it with the MOST FUN ending sequence I've ever seen in a movie. I've never had more fun in a movie than in this one. Don't pay any attention to the critics that don't like it - they never liked the first 3 anyway. This is 10x better than Spiderman, and will surely stand well against the original trilogy throughout the test of time."
1,"Stop the hype, it ain't that good","Please, refrain from the ""It's Star Wars, you have to like it!"" baloney. No, I don't have to like it, and I don't.Here are my reasons:1. Average CGI for today2. Really pathetic acting3. No concern for the character development4. Sub-par plot.Sorry, I'm not the only one that feels this way!Better luck next time!"
4,"Go, Yoda, go","This film is pretty cool....this one has a little more behind it.That s not to say it does not have faults. All the Dialogue for Count Dooku was lame. He did not sound Machiavellian enough to me.They could have done a lot more with such a good actor. Perhaps they will in the next one.The romance sections where also lame, one minute amidala was treating anakin as if he didn't exist the next they where getting it on. They should also have been more graphic in the tusken raider camp scene and made the whole 'torment' scene afterwards more dark and less whiney. [The cut scenes to yoda frowning did add the correct poignance to the scene though]And the Yoda fight scene. It was not as ridiculous .... ...All in all, this is a good film that will go into my DVD collection when it comes out. ..."
2,Over-the-top,"Is this boy-thing really going to grow up and be Darth Vader? This whimsical, egotistical, vain, prone-to-emotional-outburst, vengeful, and poorly acted Anakin? Where's the subtlety? Would Yoda, Obi-Wan and all of the others really have allowed this child to continue to study the jedi arts, and is it possible for him to have completed 10 years of study and still be such a little menace?The special effects were undoubtedly great, and the final fight scene with Yoda was brilliant fun, but the characters were one dimensional (if that), and there was no real emotion anywhere in the movie. Anakin's relationship was laughable, and completely bereft of any true quality.An entertaining movie for 10-year-old boys, but there isn't much to offer anyone else."
4,Much better than Episode I,"I loved this movie--Mr. Lucas comes back much stronger after the curiously embarassing Episode I. The special effects were magnificient, as usual, and Hayden C. is serious hottie--he made me squirm with his smouldering sensuality... Overall, the acting was typical of all the Star Wars movies: good, considering the dialogue they are given.By far the highlight of the film, was the infamous showdown between Yoda and Dooku: it gave me hope that Mr. Lucas hadn't quite lost his touch after all. However, he still needs some help with writing dialogue. Sure, this is (and always will be) his 'baby', but sometimes, you need to let someone else 'do the talking.'Definitely a must have for the collection--..."
1,--ouch--,"What a disappointment. The original trilogy (A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, The Return of the Jedi) was so fantastic, so groundbreaking and completely unforgettable. They followed the hero's journey with young Luke Skywalker, and were packed with phenomenally exciting action and completely unexpected scenes. So said, Episode II (and Episode I for that matter) are horrendously disappointing. Overstuffed with show-offy special effects and severely lacking in plot/character development, this film is a serious regression from the originals. If you're looking for the soul-stirring content of the original trilogy, don't get this film...."
2,dissappointment #2,"Is George Lucas trying to retroactively ruin our childhoods with the new trilogy? In all seriousness, something must change before the third film for the once great director to save face. Perhaps the best thing Lucas could do is to hand off the directing reins as he did for Empire and Jedi? It seems clear that these past two have been far too much about technology and lacking much artistic instinct."
1,Unbelievable,"And i thought it couldn't get any worse than ""The Phantom Menace."" Boy, was I wrong! ""Attack of the Clones"" has to be the most atrocious piece of garbage anyone has ever attempted to pass off as a decent film. While i was watching it, i kept wondering, ""Good Lord, how could the venerable Star Wars series sink to such appalling depths of utter idiocy?"" I can only pray that George Lucas has finished defiling the Star Wars legacy with this film. In Attack of the Clones, Lucas emphasises Anakin's rebellious streak in the most tactless, overdone way imagineable. I mean, the little brat has to argue and ""rebel"" about everything, as if the audience would not realise the future Vader's personality unless there were arguments between Kenobi and Anakin in practically every scene. George Lucas, do the the world a favor and refrain from flooding the cinemas with a third installment of this rubbish you call Star Wars."
4,4 Words and an Incomplete Sentence,Dazzling. Epic. Wooden. Deficient.Spectacular battle sequences triumph over hopelessly bad dialog and absurdly twisted plot.
3,"The worst Star Wars ever, but not bad...","This is the worst, but not horrible at all. There is just something about this one that makes it not good! Is it the corny humor? Could it be the deprived action? Or could it be another version of the Empire Strikes Back? YES! It can be more entertaing to play Super Star Wars than to view this without doing something else! Episode II is cool to pop culture, but that's because they can't see a classic and this is not a classic."
1,Lucas needs to be stoped!,"Ok, seriously does George Lucas actually think he can make good movies anymore? Both Episode I&II; have to be the biggest let down to anyone who is/was a fan of the originals and a let down to anyone that has taste in good cinema. It amazes me that Lucas made 3 of the best movies ever (Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi) with barely any money, but give him an unlimited budget and he makes the worst movies ever (Phantom Menace, and Attack of the Clones)...go figure!My advice...SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,Star Bores,"First of all I have to point out that this review probably holds very little merit seeing as how I have not even seen the movie, but right from the beginning I knew it was a bad idea. I barely agreed to go see the first one, as it were, seeing as how I had pretty much guessed that they would completely mutilate the heart of this series with unexperienced actors and ""mind-blowing"" special effects. The thing is, the effects are okay, but there's so much boring dialouge that I was driven to do something I have never done before: fall asleep in the movie theater. That's right everyone - I fell right asleep during some sensationally repetitive scene about Jar Jar Binks and never bothered to see the rest of the film. And when I saw that the lead for the second movie was given to Hayden I scoffed, spit and engaged in other acts of disgust in the general direction of the new ""movie"". They have NOTHING on Star Wars 4, 5 and 6. No-thing."
4,Great movie,"I saw this movie a week after it came out in theaters and got the movie and I love it! All right, I admit some parts are a little cheesy but hey it's a fun movie to watch! You can all ready tell that Anakin is going to the darkside, and that's cool. The love scenes are okay except for one. Ewan Mcgregor does a great job of plaing the part of Obi-wan. This movie will really make you think about the next film, and maybe even make you want to cry.(I know I wanted to) Anyway, this movie is fun to watch so go out and buy it, and watch as the Star Wars Saga unfolds!"
1,Stereotypical Teen Movie Set in Space,"Ok, it is star wars. The origional Star Wars movies set a standard in which every other Sci-Fi movie has since tried to break. The acting wasn't amazing, but everything else about it was way ahead of its time. Ok, now, the past two star wars movies have been horrible. They completly ride on the legacy of the origional movies, and have nothing new or origional to offer.The writing first of all leaves much to desire, the romance aspect of this film seems inferior to grocery store Romance Novels. The acting, is horrible, and the special effects aren't even close to being ahead of our time. Don't bother seeing it."
1,Oh boy...,"Well, this movie was pretty bad. Yes, the CGI was acceptable, but not the top tier compared to what is out there right now. Forget the actors; they were limited in what they brought to the screen.All in all, just sad."
3,"A good film, but not as fun as the others in the series","Even though Attack of the Clones is probably a ""better"" film than The Phantom Menace, I actually enjoyed that film more -- I felt that The Phantom Menace was more fun. I also felt that the romance in Attack of the Clones was a little unbelievable (she falls in love with him and decides to marry him in, what, two days?), and that the dialog between Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen was very awkward. My sincerest apologies to George Lucas, whose creativity has given me endless hours of entertainment, but even though I consider this a good film, I don't find it to be a great one. Aside from the romance, I also found it to be a bit slow. On a positive note, I enjoyed the Obi-Wan subplot, and the scenes between him and Anakin at the beginning of the film, including the chase scene."
5,Continuing the tradition of a great saga ...,"I saw Attack of the Clones in the theaters 6 times, and I am not normally inclined to do something like that. The special effects are awesome. I personally find Hayden Christensen as Anakin to be compelling and he is the main reason I went back so many times. There are some deleted scenes on the DVD that I agree would have enhanced the movie, such as the scene with Padme's parents. In other parts when you see the full scene of Anakin and Padme leaving Coruscant, you can help but be amazed at the precision and skill of the final editing.The DVD has many many features and lots of interesting background information to add to an already interesting and enlightening glimpse of slipping to the dark side. I anxiously await the next installament of the Star Wars saga and hope that it's not the last."
1,Total Trash,"I didn't think things could get worse after episode one. They did! Shame on you, George Lucas!"
2,SPARE ME LUCAS!,"Mr. Lucas definitely falls flat as a phosphate soda in the production of this movie. Anakin continues his worminess. Padmé Amidala's role is much better, but what the hell motivates her to fall in love with Anakin? Can't support his mental health, much less the woman who becomes his wife. Anakin is definitely a candidate for schizophrenia meds if he actually thought that Amidala would fall in love with him. Lucas just needs equilibrium pills, because obviously just looking at the script must have made him incredibly sick. It would me. The Battle of Geonosis is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! Definitely a grand finish and a show-stealer. Count Dooku's role is just a bit defunct, but not quite. After all, he needs to start the war."
4,I've seen a LOT worse,"Between some of Lucas's questionable dialogue, not to mention the Geonosis C-3PO parts, and Portman's wooden performance, AOTC came way too close to being a disaster. I'm not sure what possessed George to hold back on showing Anakin as the powerful Jedi he was supposed to be but it was a bad decision. Anakin's duel with Dooku should've been better in content & directing. But again, there's few movies I'd rather watch than SW because of the good stuff.Even though I still question the wisdom of killing off Maul in TPM, I love Dooku. He's the ultimate precise, smug second fiddle. And can you get a better henchman than Jango Fett? I loved the mystery surrounding him & Kamino as well as Geonosis. I get chills everytime I watch the first appearance of the future Stormtroopers. Anakin's first encounter with the Dark Side seemed very natural. It was nice to hear the `Imperial March' theme twice too. It was also a welcome scene to see Yoda go Jedi Master on somebody."
5,The Origin of the Clone Wars!,"The chosen one, Ani Skywalker is all grown up now. Trained as a Padawan, since the age of ten, he and Kenobi must protect Senator Amidala. When their mandate requires separation, Obi-wan must chase hunter Jango Fett.Count Dooku, Yoda's formal Padawan and Qui-Gon's formal master, is threatening the Republic with his Confederate Forces. Jango Fett serves as the template for the Republic's Clone Army, but is also working for Dooku.Ani discovers his mother's fate, his Stepbrother Owen Lars, and Amidala's mutual feelings for him. Mace Windu fights violet-ly & Amy Allen returns in Twilek form. This film is the mandatory intro to Revenge of the Sith."
5,I loved it!!!,"Seeing Attack of the Clones inspired me to rent the trilogy & Phantom Menace for my 8-year-old son. Now he's a huge fan and wants me to re-do his bedroom in an all Star Wars theme! Anikin is gorgeous in this movie! So convincing! We also saw the movie twice & just might go again this weekend. What more can I tell you?? Star Wars is LIFE! A definite thumbs up! Get out there all you fans, let's set a new record to keep Star Wars #1 at the box office!"
1,DOA!,"A long, long time ago and not too far from where I live now a guy named George Lucas made some pretty cool movies. Now all he does is make two and half hour commercials for his toys! There's not one moment of real acting in this entire picture. The movie plays out as if they decided to save time and money and skip those tedious rehearsals! It's as if they filmed the first read the ""actors"" do to familiarize themselves with the script and the other ""actors"". The effects look like a Saturday morning cartoon! Dump most of the computer animation and bring back the model makers! The entire experience was depressing. The only good thing I can say about it is there's less Jar-Jar. You should avoid this clinker at all costs. If we keep encouraging them to make trash like this by handing over our money they will be more than happy to oblige us. Oh, and as a side note: Ewan McGregor = Sir Alec Guinness as a young Obi-Wan? What a joke! Sorry Ewan you can't get there from here."
1,Razzy nominated for WORST FILM OF THE YEAR,"and well deserved. ""How to ruin a series 101"" as taught by Prof. George Lucas.This movie really has no redeeming qualities:1. A monumental waste of acting talent (Mcgregor, Lee, Jackson).2. Sub-par plot3. Lack of acting skills (Portman, Hayden)Y'all going to wait in line for the next one? Doubt it."
1,The Thrill Is Gone,"Unless you're a die-hard ""Star Wars"" fan who believes George Lucas is infallible, get ready for the mind-numbing awfulness of ""Attack of the Clones"" (2002). Sorry, folks, but the thrill is gone - not even Yoda (who wields a mean light saber) can save this digital farrago. Stick with Episodes IV through VI and forget the rest."
4,"Star Wars-Episode 2,Attack of the Clones",It is good the best thrilling movie!sCARY for kids under five.The new characters are awesome neat!Introducing Jango Fett!
1,Howard the Duck Lives On,"If you ever needed evidence that George Lucas has lost his touch, see this movie. This movie was like watching a bad high school play. Although the effects were first rate, once again Lucas has allowed them to overwhelm the story. Natalie and Hayden have about as much chemistry as Thatcher and Pinochet! Note to Lucas, please let someone else write and direct these movies, ""Howard the Duck"" has be resurrected!"""
2,A comedy?,"This was an overall annoying movie with everyone talking over one another most of the time. I guess that was their attempt at making it more realistic?I thought I would be cracking up the whole time based on the trailer but it was not what I would call a comedy. Rather, it was a drama with a couple of awkwardly funny moments. A waste of time. If you're in the mood for something cute, I just watched Ruby Sparks and would give that 4-5 stars."
3,Funny Jesse Eisenberg Movie,I didn't know about this movie until I saw it for sale on amazon. I do like Jesse Eisenberg movies and the trailer for the movie looked funny. It had some funny parts to the movie. I don't know if I would watch it again but It was good to watch. I didn't check out any of the extras yet. Sound and video quality was good.
2,Solid cast is deserving of better material,"""Why Stop Now"" is a comedy-drama in which a simple trip to an audition becomes a life-changing adventure. Piano prodigy Eli Bloom (Jesse Eisenberg) is on his way to the most important audition of his life, but first he has to drop off his mother, Penny (Melissa Leo), at a drug rehab center.Since Penny is not quite high enough to be admitted, mother and son end up at the door of her dealer, Sprinkles (Tracy Morgan). Since Penny is in debt and Sprinkles is low on product, Eli must play negotiator as the unlikely team hits the streets. A series of comic misadventures ensues, perhaps too many to make the events even passably possible. The cast is in top form, however, though each of the principals has been showcased far better in other projects.Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include a making-of featurette, interview with Tracy Morgan, and theatrical trailer."
2,Why rent now?,"The movie centers around Eli (Jesse Eisenberg) a piano prodigy who come from a broken family. He has one chance to escape his life and really be free of his family. However things quickly go wrong when he decided to help his mom buy drugs from a drug dealer Sprinkles (Tracy Morgan).For a film about drugs abuse it really rather tame. Even Tracy Morgan was subdued somehow. The film has its great points however and you see a micro back story of each character that Eli has come to interact with. This helps Eli see them has people and not just ""f ups"" has he calls them in the movie. I wish the film just had a little more. If so maybe it could have done better but for a rental I give it 2 stars"
3,Not Bose speakers but OK,"I think it's pretty amusing how many reviews for this product compare them to Bose speakers -- it's like comparing a Volkswagen to a Mercedes (yes, they each have a steering wheel). These speakers are decent but no one is going to be blown away by them. I'm not an audiophile but to me they sound a little muffled - again maybe because they are ground speakers and so aren't going to sound like outdoor wall speakers. I bought these speakers from the same company for another part of the yard and LOVE them:TIC ASP-120W Architectural Series 120-Watt Exterior Patio Speakers, WhiteThere's no comparison in the sound between the two speakers.These speakers provide good ambient sound but if you're having a party you'll want to go with something a little different in my opinion. I've just installed them - will let you know how they hold up. I'm a bit concerned reading some of the other reviews.Hope this helps."
1,Listen - Don't buy this it's not worth the effort.,"Truly atrocious animation - I simply cannot call this art, everything is unfinished. The audio resolution in 5.1 is very bad - better to switch to 2.0 dolby just to understand what they are trying to say.Found the movie twisted and underwhelming, the film is also trying ( very ) hard to manipulate and push their fantastical and religious beliefs ( and I'm not even that religious ) onto the viewer like a lame politician.Plus it's not even scary.I believe this is more of a propaganda film with an incoherent agenda.I bought this because of the high ratings and comments given by your wonderful buyers here at Amazon - oh my goodness that was so totally wrong.I'll take this afterwards and sell it at a second hand store near here to recoup my loss."
3,I expected something better,"It isn't a bad book, though ut falls short of conveying that in every war both sides suffer. This point should have been brought out stronger. Another thing which I found mildly annoying is that all main characters are described as physically very attractive, even stunningly beautiful. But other than that, writing is nice and book is a page turner. In spite of some horrible things described, somehow it won't leave a reader disturbed. Which may or may not be a good thing. In order not to repeat past mistakes, books dealing with those topics shouldn't paint the whole picture with such pretty colours to make it easy to disregard horrible details."
5,A Compelling Read,"This is an outstanding work.The ending twist was really exciting!We loved the detail of the emotional history given, as it provides a foundation that keeps the story moving.Well conceived, written and executed.Jean Sallson will become one of our regularly read writers."
5,amazing visual experiences !,"It gives you exactly extra ordinary visual experiences. Or, let me say it is exactly an invention of what movie is and how film should be. If you do like watching motion pictures, then you must see this. I mean it !"
4,Enjoyable Reading for Everyone!,"To my surprise this book was not only interesting and well put together I actually could apply it to my life as a business woman! I have two children that are young and active athletes, so I purchased this book thinking it might be entertaining and useful to them. I was right they really enjoyed reading Sports for Life. You know I bought it expecting to read something just for young athletes but I was wrong. The lessons and quotes presented through out this book are applicable from the world of sports to the world of business!Sports for Life is for all aspects of life and all ages. I found it very easy and enjoyable to read. I have already found myself referring back to this book on several occasions for quotes to use to help inspire myself as well as the people that work with me.Thank you Mr. Adams for a very enjoyable and motivating experience. My family and my company will benefit from your excellent book as I am certain others will."
4,Nice peice,It came fast and in great shape I searched the Internet for this box but could not find it anywhere very happy with my dad loved it
3,Cute but low quality,"Like the title says, this is cute (the girl friend loved it) but after a couple months the red paint started coming off."
5,As good as ever,"As with all of Poor Old Lu's stuff, I decided to listen to it about a thousand times before reviewing it. Poor Old Lu has the strange quality of sounding better and better every time you hear them. After a few weeks of hearing ""The Waiting Room"", I can honestly say that this might end out being my favorite album yet. As always, Scott's lyrics have a way of digging into my guts like no one else. The title track has already worked its way into my list of the best songs ever written. Musically and lyrically, this bunch of geeks that I know from church never stops amazing me."
4,"TIME HEALS ALL WOUNDS, EVEN TIME TRAVEL","Grieving over the death of his anvil headed English bull terrier, Jeff's parents take him on a trip to ease his grief. A statue of an English bull opens the door to time travel. As Jeff makes his way through the decades with the English bull, he makes his way through and out of his grief.This is a well written fantasy that I think will appeal to all ages. It's a great story, but impossible of course."
1,Plane Boring,Just like all books these days Dogstar had to be dull and boring.The begging of the book went on for far too long.Its slow moving and a whole bunch of the words are to hard to understand.Theres too much description and sometimes you'd just wish that Jeff and Rose didn't have to go to ball game instead of just going onto DogStar.Some charecters are lame especally Patsy Ann and Jeff. The boring parts could've been more exciting.Two other kids at my school agree with me.So why did I read the whole thing in total bordom?DogStar was one of the books in this reading club I signed up for in school.I had to read it and it was far to long for a boring book!Don't buy it.
2,Stopped working in less than 5 minutes,"I bought it to use during Sandy black out and paid 26.94 for one day delivery but Amazon shipped it 2nd day air. It passed the initial test with 100watt incandescent light bulb, but died immediately when I turn on 80watt fluorescent light. I checked the fuses and found no issue there. Being without power for 5 days, I just want to get it to work, so I open the case hoping to find a reset switch or a loose connection but none found. Now, I have to stuck with a none working unit and a bitter taste."
3,There Two Optimus Prime's? This Might get me confoused!,There are two primes. How can i tell which one is my boy friend? But i know who is the real prime! Bumble Bee Tells Teletran1 to scan both primes and i use my vr-visor for that... Serena the leader of the sailor scouts tells me i must drive the real prime for a race both primes are trucks. I talk to the real prime (aka) Jack Angel That I win the race with the real prime! The clone wont care at all! And I win the race in the end I ask if he really is my boy friend. He say's yes and kisses me this is in the Transformers Generation 2 2000 play back. The Next Ep Takes Optimus Prime (aka) Jack Angel His Team With Driver Amy (aka) Jen Aiello to New York City Central Park. Find Out What That Ep has. Till All Are One Driver Amy (aka) Jen Aiello Optimus Prime's Driver And Finacee
1,Not the best video,This is a very good video but the 1st ep is ok but the 2nd is good too but Jack Angel is The Best Optimus Prime! HA HA HA!Driver Amy
4,Polk RC 80's love them but ...,"I love my RC 85's wall mounted as my LF and RF coupled with two in ceiling RC 80's for surround and a Polk 20 for my center. These speakers do an amazing job of giving absolute clarity and are providing a true surround feeling to my room (I can hear raindrops all around me while watching The Pacific; I can hear the transformers movie like never before). I coupled these speakers with a Pioneer Elite SC-35 Receiver.I do have one complaint about these speakers: You have to spray paint these to match the color of your walls, it is very difficult to get a can of spray paint made with your mixed color paint. Your only other option is to brush the paint on and then spend hours with a needle poking the paint out of the grill speaker holes.In conclusion, for people in my situation where the wife wanted everything basically hidden this set is awesome and you really can't beat amazon's price (I tried)> i would highly recommend this set."
5,awesome speakers with great sound,easy to install and the sound is incredibly clear. If you add a subwoofer will sound even better
4,Sound ok so far!,I am going to put these in my ceiling. I tested them out in my room by cutting out some cardboard box and tested them. Seem to be ok!
5,Polk Audio RC80i In-Ceiling Speakers,This is the fourth pair of RC80i In-Ceiling speakers I have installed (for whole house music) so-far in my home and I still can't believe how nice they sound. I use Niles volume controls and as soon as I can afford it I'll be adding four more pairs.Great sounding speakers for the price.
4,In cieling speakers,"Speakers were shipped out a bit late that is why I am giving 4 star, but it came in as it was promised, so far it seems to be ok for what I need which is suround sound, they are not my main speakers you need to have good main speakers. And it was easy to install."
5,So helpful & informative!,"Learned the simplest things I'd never thought of, so effective. Makes my dog and me even happier in our life together!"
5,"Tough Calls is a practical book with ""news you can use"".","Tough Calls is the most practical, no nonsense book on selling I have ever seen. Instead of the usual positive attitude stuff that wears off after a day or two this book is stuffed with great ideas that actually helps you make a sale. No jargon. No long useless stories. Just page after page of useful selling ideas."
4,Some Ideas For Selling Tough Customers,"This is a bit of an amatuerish book but was fun to read. The book attempts to deal with the 'problem client' which makes up one out of every six customers. The book does well identifying the six most common problems and the five most stressful customers, even if this is based on a short survey of only 1000 hand-picked salesman that weren't asked open-ended questions but given a short checklist. I found the author's answers and solutions to these problems to range from insightful to childish. I liked this book however because it made me think and gave me a few ideas. One idea deals with complainers. Get them to complain about your competitors and their bosses and you may actually get some valuable information.Four Stars on a Clear Night"
5,Ice Age,This is my grandson's all time favorite movie. He just can't get enough and Scrat is just as rascally addorable as he is. Can't wait for #2 to premier later this month! Excellent!
1,Digital Copy Expired,"The movie arrived packaged new and in good condition. The digital copy activation code, however, had expired 6 months previously. This clearly is false advertising."
3,iTunes Expired Digital Copy,"Great movie but...If you use iTunes, do NOT pay extra for this ""Digital Copy"" edition. I found that iTunes would not recognize the DRM code (while other media management tools do). Fox (the producer of the movie) responded that while THEY have extended ALL of their codes to remain functional, that iTunes has NOT modified their system to accept the extended expiration. Apple's customer service on this matter has been less than responsive: at this point they are offering me a free RENTAL, in exchange for the loss of a movie I should have permanently... just not acceptable."
4,Great movie! The kids love it!!,Our kids loved the 3rd Ice Age that came out this summer. We looked several places for this one before finding it on Amazon. This one has lots of special features. Highly recommend.
3,Good for Kids,"While watching Ice Age, I had the strange feeling that I had seen this movie before. The plot seemed to be a frosty version of the same basic cartoon movie adventure with childish humor and some great animation. The characters were interesting and the voices were fitting, but they did not seem unique other than being a bit different from the average animals.This is a great movie for any kids or animation fans and is not a bad movie by any standards. But for those who want to see an amazing movie with similar animation, save your money for Shrek."
5,I LOVE Scrat!,"Okay, this is a great movie and I don't mean just for kids. If anything, rent or buy this JUST for Scrat that adorable prehistoric squirrel. Every part he's in is funny, and he even has his own little cartoon movie DVD that comes with this. Viva Scrat!"
1,Don't buy if you own mac,Ordered a digital copy because they download a lot faster. This one however would not download because thesource code is expired for iTunes. Fox had no resolution other than saying it would work on microsoft.
2,Misleading,"I felt the trailer for this movie was misleading. One would think Scrat was the lead character but he's lucky to have a full 10 mins of show time. Scrat is the hilarious squirrel/rat character that you see running around with an acorn. Unfortunately, the story is based around 4 other characters that are somewhat entertaining... but you only get a laugh when Scrat makes a short appearance. I'm a fool for buying this movie before viewing it."
4,no scratches,It has no scratches on the dvd which is awesome. I haven't watched it yet but will soon. My 4.5 year son is happy to c it.
1,Worthless,"I first took the LSAT in 2002. I had never looked at an LSAT before, did not know what to expect, and was a little hungover. I scored okay, a 155. I decided to take the LSAT again and this time about a year ahead of time, I purchased Kaplan. I studied very hard, did the exercises, and the CD Rom.To make a long story short, I got a 153 the second time I took the LSAT. In other words, I did better going into the test blind than I did with a year and $40 invested in Kaplan. I think Powerscore would have been much better. On top of that, they would not honor their money back guarantee. If I take the LSAT again, I am going to try the hungover approach and score better."
5,Love these!,"Great for the many screwdrivers, etc that we have...keeps them accessible :) I ordered like 3 but think ill be getting more soon!"
3,3 stars for the name only,"YAWN....excuse me, was I sleeping? I dreamt I was reading FLowers In The Attic, boy was I ever wrong !!!"
1,Boring and Disappointing,"While it usually takes me an hour or so to read these mini-series books this one took me 4 days. Why? It was so boring I could not get interested in it. The books have become terrible and I no longer look forward to reading them. Where are the surprises? The shocking news? The ones where you can't go to bed until you finished it? Star has been out in my town for almost three weeks-and I haven't even thought about buying it. The old Andrews books would no sooner hit the stand that I was in line at the book store. I am so disappointed that someone could tarnish her name like this. She was a truly great writer, but now the books have gone to crap."
2,"NOT TERRIBLE, BUT NOT BY ANY MEANS VC ANDREWS STYLE","Okay, if I would have bought this book and it was written by another author, I wouldn't have been so disapointed. The book wasn't really that bad, it's just the fact that her books used to be so good and interesting. I still read her old books over and over again. But I don't want to read these new ones at all. But I will still buy them because of the name on the book. But the Ghostwriter is seriously damaging VC Andrew's name by putting out these second rate, little kid books. And a word of advice, make the next series of books about 300 pages longer."
4,"Too short, but decidedly insiteful","some of the things the the charecter of misty said in the story really made sense, & was stuff i could identify with, being a child of divorce. She calls herself an ""orphan with parents"" which comes very close to the truth. i liked the book, but as i said, it was to short. it wasn't styled very much like V.C. Andrews originals, which for one thing were series of novels, in stead of a mini-series of novellas with a longer conclusion. this series didn't have as much mystery, & lacked V.C. Andrews signature ""flashback book"" going back at least a generation to clear up any questions."
5,An overview of the Dalai Lama's philosophy of life,"It's an interesting book that provides much insight into the Dalai Lama's philosophy regarding answers to the essential questions of our being. His values stem from the Tibetan Buddhism as he is the religious leader thereof. Another book along these lines that deals with the art of happiness and is also a great handbook for living which has helped me a lot, and I recommend highly is Dietmar Scherf's ""I Love Me: Avoiding and Overcoming Depression""--also available at Amazon."
5,(:,the product was in excellent quiality and arrived in the date it said it would. couldnt ask for a better service!
2,More psychology than Buddhism,"Having studied Buddhism as a philosophy student in college many years ago, I was interested in this book. However, after reading it I found it to be quite disappointing. It was more of the psychology of Buddhism by Howard Cutler, the real author, than genuine Buddhism from the Dalai Lama. I think an attempt to translate Buddhist principles for understanding by a Western mind, rather than transforming Buddhism into Western concepts, would have been more difficult, to be sure, but more useful."
5,For those searching for meaning in this existance,"This is one of the most wonderful books I have ever read. There is so much we can learn from the Dalai Lama, he is a true example of the compassionate and non-violent attitude we must undertake if we are to survive the coming century. This book is a must read for those that are lonely, feel isolated, searching for love or meaning to their existance. It has been said that unhappiness is the plague of the West, this book offers insight in how to fill our lives with genuine contentment."
3,Good expose of the negative qualities of Western psychology.,"Western psychology compares poorly with Buddhist philosophy when they meet to discuss emotions, happiness, insight, love, and compassion. Dr. Cutler is to be praised for honestly revealing the shortfalls of his field and his own attitudes. I would have preferred for there to be more Dalai Lama and less Dr. Cutler, but Dr. Cutler's ruminations gave me a good glimpse into the mental attitude of the people working in the psychology field today, as well as the general Western cultural attitude. No wonder there are so many depressed people!"
1,"Important subject, bad book!","I hate to think that this would be the first exposure to Buddhism that one would receive. This book is poorly written, and doesn't come close to capturing either the essence of Buddhism or the personality of the Dalai Lama. The book is more of a monument to the ego of Dr. Cutler than anything else. For those who are truly looking for an introduction to Buddhism, I would recommend ""Awakening the Buddha Within"" by Lama Surya Das, or ""The Accidental Buddhist"", by Dinty Moore. I could not in good conscience recommend Dr. Cutler's book (for it is most assuredly Dr. Cutler's and NOT the Dalai Lama's) to anyone."
1,this book is a fraud,I'm very disappointed - I thought this book was by the Dalai Lama - but it isn't. It is by some psychiatrist. I wanted to hear what the Dalai Lama had to say - not Harry Cutler. Don't buy this if you expect words of wisdom from the Dalai Lama!
1,Dr Cutler's Prism Has No Colors <No Stars>,"The Dalai Lama didn't write this book. An American psychoanalyst wrote it. All of the good doctor's observations and analysis are presented as somehow 'echoing' the ideas of the thing being analyzed, the patient: Dalai Lama.The book is therefore, a hoax. The Dalai Lama, as Cutler concedes early on, has several good books which explain his religion (which is were the truth of this book begins, and ends).This book is clearly not one of them."
5,"It's about achieving HAPPINESS, not buddhist enlightenment!","Many of the comments so far focus on the fact that this book isn't an introduction to Buddhism and the Dalai Lama. It doesn't claim to be! If that's what you were expecting, you should shop more carefully. It's about achieving HAPPINESS, people! It gives the Eastern approach, with Cutler playing Devil's Advocate with his very Western approach. Nor does it give any ready answers - that's up to you as the reader, and isn't for lazy readers. In my opinion, this book is a tool to promote thought, not a manifesto, nor a TV programme. I not only enjoyed it, but enjoyed the directions in which it sent my thoughts."
2,Wasn't what I expected at all,"This was the first by the Dalia Lama that I've ever bought, was an impulse buy. I was extremely disappointed to discover that it was written by Dr Cutler with excerpts from interviews and speeches made by Dalai Lama. :[ I agreed with several principles of the book, but overall I was left unhappy."
2,"Cute, but lacking substance",This book is a good light read but lacks the level of substance necessary to give any real insight. I wish Cutler would have gone in one of two directions: a.)delve deeper into the western interpretation of the Dali Lama's teachings or b.) give us more (less repetition) of the Dali Lama's teachings.
1,Cutler uses a big name to promote a little book,"I felt deceived by the cover and touted authorship. Certainly the Dalai Lama is more substantial than this glimpse of him we receive through the restricted lens of a western psychiatrist who often comes off as petty, immature and missing the big picture..."
5,A true handbook for sources of happiness,"This book presents a fundamentally different way to discovering happiness from within one's self. Cutler tried to describe in the Dalai Lama's terms, finding happiness by consciously developing patience, contentment, compassion, and empathy to human beings. The book also suggest ways to developing these virtues and logically convinces the reader about the futility of the ways. Although some examples may seem obvious, the book is a must read for every body and a great education for life."
4,A taste of buddhism in the west.,"This book is great for the non-buddhist, seeking a practical self-help text book. The Dalai Lama's message is compassionate, and eternal for all forms of life regardless of religion.I must also warn you of the pretencious, arrogant psychiatrist. Acting as the interviewer he only confuses the reader with psychological jargon that often has little to do with Dalai Lama's message."
3,Mechanics of Electric Guitar,"Excellent two DVD set for beginners. It really covers all the basics for someone buying their first electric guitar. Lee Hodgson walks you through some scales and explains timing. He stresses practicing with a metronome. He is right. It is painful, but really important. It will give you a sense of timing which is essential to playing with others.Good DVD, though I wish it went more in depth with music theory. If you are an intermediate player, this may not help you much. Still, it's a keeper."
3,fun not well made,I agree with the other reviews. This toy is a petri dish for mold. Also Boots floats upside down when he get water in him. The Dora filled up immediately with water and I can get it out. My 2 year old does like playing with it.
3,Dora & Boot Water Toy,Dora's head fills with water and does not drain. I was afraid of mold and other bacteria so I ended up getting rid of the toy. Boots was ok as he is a squirt toy.
4,great toy,"My daughter has had two of these. She loves Dora and this toy is great at the pool and in the tub. I also like that Dora has a life vest, it reminds my daughter that she needs her vest to get in the pool. I replaced one becasue of the mold and soap scum build up."
4,Not bad for low budget,"This film was corny at times and lacked any real depth. It was enjoyable for light entertainment and if you are critical of movies than aviod this one. If you want less than oscar quality, fun entertainment to see with a friend. You would enjoy this movie. I enjoyed the film because it was light and funny, even when they didn't write it that way."
2,I Tried So Hard To Be Kind,"Clearly, this is an amateur production, and it shows. I'm not expecting a high-gloss on a film that was shot over five days. And I certainly can't fault the intentions of the film-maker or cast, but despite my attempting to make it through, the film ended up an unwatchable mess.The performances were flat (in fact, the actress playing the blind woman can be described as concave; how can any actress, no matter her skill level have absolutely no affect at all?), and the photography, allowing that digital video has the tendency to be drab, is eye-bleeding."
3,More of a side trip than a journey to simple gay gay romance,"While watching JOURNEY OF JARED PRICE, I discovered it was made on a low budget. Now that is not necessarily bad, and more often than not during the film I overlooked some of the simpler elements. However, the cinematography was a huge distraction; too often, the camera would track the movement of every actor&#65533;s hand and pause on whatever the had just moved/set down/lifted up as if it were an important event. The dialogue was inconsistent; either warm and touching or cliché. Still, this remains a pleasant movie, the sort that needs to be made, but I hope that more care (and perhaps more money) is involved in the director/screenwriter&#65533;s next project."
4,BJH flies high on Gone To Earth.,"A stunningly gorgeous album, Gone To Earth displays mid-period BJH at their absolute peak. The band stumbled on Time Honored Ghosts, regained their footing on the previous Octoberon, and sound downright brilliant on this '77 release. Crank up the headphones and totally immerse yourself in the beauty and lushness of this album: Hymn, the unforgettable, mellotron-drenched leadoff track, Poor Man's Moody Blues (a sly tweak at those who accused the band of mimmicking the Moodies), the haunting Spirit On The Water, or keyboardist Woolie Wolstenholme's epic Sea Of Tranquility. If you're into '70s progressive rock and want to own one album by this long-standing British band, let it be Gone To Earth."
2,What's new?,"Sorry to say, but there isn't much to tell about this game. I would preferably rather go with the one on PS2 or something. The sad thing is that you might as well just get Gauntlet Legends on Playstation. Why? To me, it's the same exact thing. But the programmers took some of their time to shove some new stuff in. For example, the levels are different (This only means the worlds are, not the stroy line; the boses and characters are practically the same, and yes, Skorn's in here). However, There's no co-operative, and I still haven't figured out what the gold's for! But just not to let your hopes up, it is a decent game. The graphics are okay. But if you're someone like me that actually wants a good action game, don't buy it..."
3,Great Toy - Limited Longevity,"My 6 cats absolutely loved this toy and kept them occupied for hours at a clip. The only drawback is that 2 of my cats love to chew and they chewed the cord in half within 6 hours. Luckily I had purchased 3 of them - but those 3 toys only lasted 3 days. If the cords that hang the bouncing toy were more sturdy I would have rated it higher. For all cat toy manufacturers - please make these cords stronger. More than likely, I would purchase more, but be warned that if you have chewers, they will not last."
4,great but color rubs off,we got the itme just fine but when we dusted it before placing in bathroom we noticed the that the color was coming off. It was a bad spary color job on the shelf. Flimzy but i guess it does the job. For this price that is what you get. There is much better stuff out there but it is easy to assmble and the color staining my hands orange for a few hours was the bad. Other than that is it worth the 29$.
1,Sony Camcorder Zoom Microphone is The PITS!,"Don't waste your time buying this microphone which does not fit the bracket on Sony digital-8 cameras. I can't imagine why they sell this microphone. In retrospect, none of the camera accessories listed on this web site indicate that the ECM-HSI is a viable accessory. It does not mention the microphone.Yet, the specs on the microphone itself indicates that it easily connects to the bracket on the digital-8 cameras. Not is not the case.I wasted my money on two microphones..."
4,Very Dark and Moving,"A really great novel with wonderfully creative language and plot. It's dark, emotional and really powerful. It takes awhile to get rolling, but once you do, you'll be carried away with the prose and characterization."
5,Take the falling out of 'falling in love',"Deborah clearly defines the true lowest-common denominators about love and loving, that every religion, faith and philosophy recognizes, but that maybe we (as individuals) don't let ourselves live, much less acknowledge, on a daily basis for whatever reasons.Of all the books written on love that I'm aware of and have read, 'The Seven Natural Laws of Love' is the ONLY one that tells the TRUTH about love...truth being that which cannot be argued about.No need to 'fall' (implying an expectation of hurt) into love when each of us, already, is there."
2,I dont know much about it,This item is useless because it doesnt come with a instructional book. it doesnt say anything about how to use it or what models is able to charge......not even on the website of the manufacturer. dont buy it.
2,All the depth of the Celestine Prophecies,Well I suppose the smart ass title should have been a tipoff. This book manages to both flatten and drain all the depth out of people whom have cultivated depth their whole lives. The author has adopted the style of interviewing where the interviewer spends 3/4 of the time telling you about themselves and their reactions to what the person they are interviewing says. It is a distracting and in this case disappointing technique whereby the author manages to reduce holy men to trivial quotes with all the spiritual depth of the Celestine Prophecies. Because of this artifice the book distorts more than it illuminates and should be avoided by anyone looking to encounter contemporary articulations of authentic Christian desert wisdom. Look at Matta al Maskin (Orthodox Prayer) himself rather than this pablum about his brethren.
2,A caveat,"However wonderful, these are not new recordings, but a compilation of old ones from various CDs, so that if you have recordings of Rutter's carols, you might want to compare titles and dates of issue before you order this one. This should have been made clear in Rutter's own editorial note."
5,Great Healthy Eating Cookbook,"This is my favorite cookbook. I had checked it out several years ago from my LLL group library and have been waiting to get a copy (they are hard to find, especially at a reasonable price). I finally got my copy and I'm not disappointed. This book is wonderful for a family that lives a healthy lifestyle or is working to improve their eating habits. This is also a great book for someone that wants to cook from scratch. Wonderful recipes that are kid friendly. A number of snacks and breakfasts that are sweetened without table sugar. Very few recipes call for white flour (the only one I've seen is for the glaze for donuts). Even the donuts are whole wheat. You can learn to make corn tortillas truly from scratch (cooking the corn in lime and everything). You can learn the technique for making homemade bread. You can learn how to cut and de-bone a whole chicken. Things that you just don't see in average cookbooks. I highly recommend this cookbook."
2,Major disappointment....no original ideas or thoughts.,"Judging from the other great reviews, I decided to give this book a try. It was a MAJOR disappointment. There is nothing fresh or unique about the author's ideas. In the Introduction, the author speaks of his adding in thoughtful quotes from other authors as such an original idea. Oh yeah, like millions of books aren't outlined in the same fashion. Actually, I didn't even care for the selected quotes he did use to introduce each chapter! The author may have a few good ideas here and there, but the book is so crammed full of filler, it's hard to decipher out the simple good advice. K.I.S.S. Keep It Simple Silly!"
2,Pistol case,Amazon ad states is a large pistol case. Is by no means large. I cannot get a Ruger III with a scope in the case.
3,Good composite,"I found this to be a good composite of imformation from many famous authorities on child-rearing. However, some of the areas addressed don't go into enough detail on the subjects- I found consulting the individual authors' own books a little more helpful in putting things into greater context. Overall, a good book though."
5,Let it Snow...Cookies!,"Last Christmas I trekked though, what seemed like, a hundred stores in search of a snowflake cookie cutter. All I could find were cutters shaped liked coyotes, saguaros, chile peppers, lizards -- HORRORS -- cutters to cry over because they were, in my opinion, lacking the Christmas ""spirit and priced at 14.95 EACH. I'm not Scrooge, but I'm NOT up to being Scrooged at Christmas by greedy proprietors! I was disappointed because not a snowflake could be found. :( After the holidays, I Googled ""Snowflake Cookie Cutters"" and was led to Amazon.com. Amazon.com NEVER ceases to amaze me! I found several that I liked. I was over the moon when they arrived at my door. Perfect snowflakes cutters! This year, thanks to Amazon.com there will be snowflakes in the desert for dessert! Oooh, this Christmas WILL be merry and bright, not to mention yummy!Snowflake Cookie Cutter - 3""Snowflake Cookie Cutter - 4""Snowflake Cookie Cutter - 5"" - #2"
5,"Fast, easy, and healthy","this is one of my favorites, if not, the favorite. It is easy, fast, and healthy especially to take to work for lunch."
3,Decent if you don't use the whole flavor packet,"We tried this first with none at all of the so-called flavor packet, and then added a little tiny bit of the packet. Adding just a tiny bit of the packet was plenty. If one were to add the entire flavor packet it would be too salty. There is a lot of salt in this, but thankfully one can avoid that by not using the full flavor packet. We added a little less water than suggested, and still found it to be more watery than we liked. The easy solution, of course, is to add even less water. On the whole, if one does not use the flavor packet it is pretty decent. I have recently had the very expensive per oz shredded black beans from Barry Farms which I prefer to this - those are just pure black beans. The prize per oz for the Barry Farms item is very steep, however."
1,Bad,"I followed the directions and the product was bad. I wouldn't even call it soup, much more like concrete. I couldn't finish it. My partner had the same opinion after trying. I think the Nile products are much better....."
2,Nasty,"I tried this as a break from heavy lunches. I found it really nasty. The flavor powder clumps up, no matter how vigorously you stir the mess, and the beans stay a bit too hard. The final texture is like maple syrup with lumps. The flavor is horrid -- dried something, but no resemblance to any food I've had (and homemade black bean soup is a favorite). This seems to be a product devised by someone who considers food only a nutrient object, not a potential source of joy in life. I cannot recommend this to anyone who has taste buds."
3,quick lunch,I eat this soup because it is quick and full of fiber. I eat the entire container because I don't think it is really two servings. I don't use all of the flavor packet because the sodium content is too high for a single serving. It works as a quick lunch for a gluten free nurse.
4,Black Bean and Lime soup,"My daughter is vegan and it's hard to find things she will eat, this was a little pricey for dried soup, it was easily made according to microwave directions and she did like the taste but wished there were more whole beans in it. Four stars because of the price and lack of whole beans."
3,"two ""servings"" in this one container","I've had several of Dr. McDougall's soup cups and liked them all. The taste on this was really good, but I was highly disappointed that there were two servings in this one cup."
2,Not that great.,This item looks cute in the picture but it looks like something you would buy at a flea market for really cheap. My opinion is it's just a super tacky lamp.
3,it won't hide the pattern on a regular Boppy,"I was bummed to see that when I put this slipcover on my old Boppy (NOT a bare naked) you can clearly still see the pattern on the old Boppy.But I still like the way it feels, it's just not the world's prettiest boppy!"
3,"Too thin, no protection from spit -up & diaper leaks","I received a hand-me-down boppy and wanted to freshen it up with a new cover and also wanted to be able to throw the cover in the wash, instead of the entire pillow. The cover arrived and it was incredibly thin. You could see right through it and it didn't look as though it would provide much protection from spit-up and diaper leaks. I ended up taking this cover back and buying a regular boppy cover (purple with bees). It is still thin but I paid $5 less for it."
2,found this an unneccessary purchase,"Was told I would need this to cover the boppy while nursing my first daughter. It remains unused. I prefer to cover the boppy with a receiving blanket and then use the remaining blanket to wrap over the baby. So far boppy is spotless despite using it for nearly every feeding for the past three months. She has just now outgrown the boppy, and the cover will be returned!"
5,EXCELLENT!,I have read a lot of Scott's books and this one is simply hilarious! definitely a bargain at its full retail price.
5,:),I do thinks this help and it looks cool the price was great I have no complaints. So Far so Good.
1,TERRIBLE,TERRIBLE PRODUCT!!! THIS PRODUCT IS A COMPLETELY WASTE OF MONEY!!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR 2 TO 3 DOLLARS TRUST ME...YOU WON'T WEAR THIS BRACELET EVER....IT IS VERY POORLY MADE YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR IT IS CHEAP AND THAT IS EXACTLY HOW ITS MADE...SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND GET SOMETHING BETTER
1,Hermalite,"This bracelet broke as I was putting it on my wrist, glad it wasn't expensive! I hope others have better luck than I did!"
3,Hematite Magnetic Bracelet,"It's very attractive and would be nice worn strictly as an item of jewelry (bling). However, having worn it constantly for a little better than a week, I removed it because I saw absolutely no change in my situation."
2,Could be a cute accessory i guess...,"I bought this for my dad as a present, he has joint and muscle discomfort and i thought i'd try this out, unfortunately it was a waste and didn't work for him. Could be a cute accessory i guess.."
4,Easy Fix,"I wanted to use two monitors on a low profile desktop. Installation was a snap. True plug and play. This computer is a business machine and is not used for gaming, so I do not know if the performance would be satisfactory for that purpose. For business apps it's a winner. The only criticism is that I had to buy a low profile adapter separately."
4,Oporto Cathedral,"This is a wonderful, albeit short tour of the wonders of the Oporto Cathedral, its architectural style, its history and its treasures. The dvd traces the history of this glorious monument and its recent restoration. The Oporto Cathedral is a magnificent edifice filled with beautiful treasures from the Middle Ages to the present era. It is a focal point for this important Portuguese city, the cradle of the Portuguese idenitity. The dvd could be a bit longer so that some of the adjoining neignborhood could be examined. It is, nevertheless, a wonderful introduction to this beautiful Portuguese city."
1,Young adult coloring book,"While Blau provides some interesting blurbs on some Tibetan Yajrayana meditational items such as prayer wheels and bells which are illustrated (just in black ink) in an circular form, solid information regarding mandalas themselves are just as sparse as representations of actual mandalas. Virtually ignored is the meditational purpose of a mandala as a tool for transformation of the ego enabling the practitioner to advance toward enlightenment. Also missing is information regarding the basic formulae for a mandala, including a representation of the five 'Jina' Buddhas or aspects, with their respective colors and instruments, each in their own area of a mandala. This is Buddhist ""lite"" that can be read in 10 minutes."
4,I Liked It,"I had never read anything by this author before, but picked this book up on impulse in a bookstore. I was surprised that I really enjoyed it-I don't usually go for the artsier novels, but his writing style carried me from page to page without hitting a snag. It's more character-driven than story-driven, though, but the characters are realistic. I found more value in the small-a descriptive sentence here, an observation there-than in the larger plot, but I think that's how it was supposed to be."
4,Tense and graceful,"Interesting build up of tension from Anne's dark childhood, through her transitory employment and love affair. Faulks maintains style and grace throughout it all. With the exception of gratuitous, extraneous political scenes, I found this novel to be well-written and entertaining."
2,A Bit Dissapointing,"I am a big fan of 80's films, even the cheesy ones. But this one was just a dissapointment for some reason. The dragon looked cool enough, but I didn't think they used it to the full effect they could have. The entire film had a very slow pace and just wasn't interesting or even 'fun' enough. And also not dark enough as well. I won't even talk about the acting, since anyone buying this movie shouldn't even be concerned about it. But when I heard it had the ""coolest dragon effects before Dragonheart"", well... I've seen better effects from the 80's than this. Pass this one up unless you are a major dragon fan."
2,Dull,A fire breathing dragon terrorizes the British sountryside. A sorceror dies in the process. I thought this was a waste outside of a couple dragon scenes and would probably not want to see it again. Contains one scene of brief nudity.
1,kills fish,"i agree with everyone else, had a clown loach with ich while the rest of the tank was so far spared. this killed all my neon tetras, teh other fish seem to be doing ok so far but i would not buy this again, would not recommend it"
5,ANOTHER GREAT RANMA 1/2 SERIES,"ANOTHER GREAT SERIES BY VIZ VIDEO. IT'S A LOT BETTER THAN BUYING THE VIDEOS SEPERATELY FOR ONE REASON ONLY.

1,Absolutely dissapointing,"This really is an upset. Their is nothing in this (very short) book that you can't come up with yourself.One project included is for a cup... You take a piece of pipe, put an end cap on, and there is your cup. That IS an actual project from the book. I'm not kidding or exaggerating.I wouldn't recommend this book even to a child looking to just have fun. A kid could come up with more interesting projects on his own."
2,Where's the Beef?,"Although this book holds a lot of information, the stories are week and lack substance. I read the entire book in 3 hours (stopping for lunch). The source of the stories was limited, It lacked many popular stories I (being a native Staten Islander) heard as a child (The Dissoway ghosts, Lady by the well, Ghost dogs), and went with the stories made popular by the media. This book would be better as a childrens book."
1,Not worth it for us,"I just logged in to see this item's price so that I could price ours for the consignment sale. Neither of my girls was crazy about tummy time, and this didn't help that at all."
5,Great toy for tummy time!,"This is a great take-off on the normal boppy (which is also a wonderful invention!). I like that it's smaller, which is better for propping baby up for tummy time. I also like that toys attach to the boppy. I usually add a few more links on, for variety ... but this is not necessary. Tummy time is such an important part of baby's day, especially because of doctors' suggestions of keeping baby on his back to sleep. This is a great way to keep tummy time easy and fun!"
4,Great tummy time aid,"The Tummy Play Boppy has been a great addition to our nursery. We first purchased it to help our baby (5 months old at the time) achieve more daily time on her tummy. Although she didn't like it at first, she was able to spend 20 minutes per day in it after about a week. This is more success than we had with any other tummy time activity. Also, our baby can use it as an entertainment activity, since we put a tummy time picture show toy in front of it. The baby watches the show, and she also plays with the toys that are attached to the rings of the tummy play boppy. The baby (now 7 months old) still uses it freqently today.My only complaint kind of echoes what one of the other reviewers said - that it closes too tightly around the baby's middle. However, I found that after a week of me stretching it out / breaking it in, it got looser and didn't hug the baby so much. Then, the baby liked it much better.Overall, I am very glad I purchased this Tummy Play Boppy!"
1,"Terrible sound, lighting, and high cheese factor","Unfortunately, I ordered this dvd before I read some of the reviews on it. Being that there was another review that started that the sound dropped in the first 10 minutes of the dvd and never came back on, it sounds like this is a major problem with the product.Even without the sound problem this had to be one of the worst documentories I have ever seen in my life. It was cheap and the presentation was not worth the high price tag. I felt the presentation in the documentary ""Samurai - The Last Warriors"" was much better and more informative."
5,worth every penny,"I'm really into Samurai history & martial arts that have swords as theprimary weapon of use and if you want to know about the Samurai and hisculture, buy this DVD, it's worth every penny. This video is the bomb."
1,save your money,"Okay.... in part it was my fault. I thought that for TEN bucks I was getting a SET. But, it turns out that it is for ONE poor quality kind of a painted-in-china wine glass. Very thin and fragile."
5,awesome game,"This game is rich in detail, and is really fun. The backgrounds always blend in well with everything. It's challenging and very much fun!"
4,LOOPHOLES REALLY DO EXIST!!!,"I got a speeding ticket in Connecticut and the State Trooper was using laser. Following the advice given in the Educated Guide, I plead not guilty and went to court. I showed the judge a copy of the state law that pertained to calibration of laser and radar. In Connecticut the police have to calibrate laser or radar by any means other than an internal check of the operation of the equipment. NOTHING exists to do this with laser as of yet. It is ALL done internally. The judge read the law, talked to the Trooper, and dismissed the ticket. The fine was for $260.00!! There really are loopholes that do work. This book helped me. I recommend it."
2,"please,not a bat-flop","this batman game is good,but some bad into it.everytime i try to beat black mask,i lose. its ok when its' fixed,but you can't fix the camera angles.I gave this game 2 stars because camera angles and ok graphics."
1,Have high hopes,"well, after the huge dissapointment of Batman Vengance, i have hopes for this. this game is not based on the cartoon, and more dark. you can have REAL fighting, and detective work. And i gave it 1Star only because it isn't out yet, but i want it to be good."
1,Resident Batman,"The camera angles in this game absolutely stink. They remain fixed and do not follow you around as you move through the game. This method of gameplay worked pretty well in the hit series Resident Evil, but plays out very poorly in this game. It's difficult to maintain fighting sequences with bad guys and to see exactly what you're doing. The fighting sequences are very frustrating and the punch and kick combos look terrible (Batman kicks low, to the shins! now that's low for the dark knight).The tools also stink. The batarangs and smoke bombs are awkward to use, and pretty much unusuable during combat.I do have to give this game some props for the music track and style - both of which are very good. But the gameplay is awkward. This game is difficult, and not in a good way. Huge batman fans, prepare to be disappointed."
1,the future is dark with this game,"horrible gameplay, controls, and story i hope you didn't waste the money i did to get this game even if its under $20 dont get it."
3,"An average game, there's not much to it...","For the hardcore Batman fans, this ones a keeper. But for the gamers, it's more of a rental. I prefer Batman Begins than this game. The plus side is that this game is not as hard as I thought it would be. The negative...it tends to get boring, so the replay value is low. Still...a collectible gem for the hardcore Batman fan."
1,Batman Dark Tomorrow Xbox,The worst game of all. A disgrace to Batman lovers. Very tough to control - should have been like the Spiderman game. WHen are these producers gonna realize we neeed an awesome superhero game for us to like it!!
4,Well done Sue!,"Sue Cook has come a long long way from her early, punchy but clumsy designs. Most British designers lack the boldness of American stitching, but Sue has managed to capture the bright and striking texture of good American design. If you like Donna Kooler, you'll like Sue Cook (not the early designs). If she continues to develop, we could have a mix of Kooler and Englebreit - now wouldn't that be something?? Literally hundreds of good, fun designs, a great resource well up there with the Kooler and Hawkins books. Thank you Sue!"
1,"OK for one-time use, but the worst of four types","I tried these,PeeWee Multi Use Disposable Changing Pads - 48 Pack,Huggies Changing Pads - Disposable, Case of 40 (5 packs of 8 pads)&Munchkin A&H; Disposable Changing Pad - 10 Pack, and these are my least favorite.Pros:They're inexpensive, so they may be good if you want to thow them out after every use (maybe for public changing tables)The waterproof layer works fine.Cons:They're thin, almost reminding me of toilet paper in public school bathrooms (a long time ago.)They're small, so if I didn't use two pads to cover the target area, my daughter's changing time poop squirts often ended up off the pad.When they stay clean, they hardly stay in place; kicking feet scoot them out of the way, and then they cling to baby's clothes when I pick her up.I ended up using these as disposable placemats for when my 3-year-old ""helps"" me stir dinner."
1,Flimsy - Do Not purchase,"Do not bother with this product - it will not save you time or clean-up! The pads are super flimsy and no better than a paper towel. We had purchased a different brand before and LOVED them as they saved time and clean-up woes when our little one decides to continue going to the bathroom during a changing. If you have a kicker or squirmer, this pad will be gone in two kicks. They are useless - just use a paper towel instead and save some money."
4,"good resource, but not for everyone","While this book was very thorough and had a lot of good info, there was a lot of emphasis on keeping animals for food or slaughter. This is fine for some folks, it just wasn't something that I was interested in. There was also mention of keeping rabbits and guinea pigs to sell to laboratories, which probably isn't something a lot of today's earth loving folk would be interested in. The book does have some good information about getting started gardening, as well as how to get started keeping a variety of animals along with bees, fish, frogs, and earthworms. All in all though, I think it is sort of more of a book to give you general ideas than anything else. If you wanted to really get into gardening or bee keeping, etc., I would opt to get a book specifically about such a topic. If you just want some ideas about what you might do and/or how to get started, then this book would be a good match for you."
4,Worth every dollar,"I can't say enough about the new Steel Battalion. The controller makes you feel like you are really piloting a VT (vertical tank) Everything is there, from the triggers, right down to windshield wipers. And with Line of Contact out, it is even better being able to play with other VT pilots over Live. Not that everyone has a spare [$$$] laying around, but if you can pull it toghether, you will not be disappointed"
3,Kindle book,"Book is not as good as I had anticipated. Author is pretty self serving, but speaks her mind. I think Nora might do better writing about a topic that is not so personal."
2,Heartburn,"The movie was better than the book. Considering it is an older book, it isn't worth paying #9.99 for the book."
4,Not quie as good as 'Things We Lost In The Fire'.,"Although not as good as their masterpiece 'Things We Lost In The Fire'. This remains a very solid effort, perhaps their third best album. The first 4 songs are particularly strong, however, a couple of lesser tracks towatd the end, give the album 4 stars."
5,His Kind of Woman,"Recently, from film noirs, You released the move ""His Kind of Woman"" with Robert Mitchum and Jane Russell. This movie I have been waiting to buy for many years. It is one of the best Adventure movie I have enjoyed very much. I recomend it to all ages. Robert Mitchum at his best."
3,"Meh, I Don't Recall This One Much, And Now Know Why","I'm surprised this was rated so high on lists of Pink Panther movies. Perhaps out of 'historical respect'? It was really pretty bland and I had to force the rest of the family to stay with it for the sparse moments of ha-ha time. I didn't recall much of the story from my childhood experiences of Pink Panther films, and now I know why. Very little was memorable."
3,Inspector Clouseau's Pale Shadow,"This movie is cute and funny, especially in the scenes that feature Peter Sellers. The grave weakness of this movie, the first in this series, is that the emphasis is on the dashing and debonair jewel thief played by David Niven. There's nothing wrong with that, except the character was already a ""stock"" character and there's really nothing interesting about them either. Niven's acting was great and the leading ladies are lovely. Also, I had forgotten the great musical number in the middle.But no one can spill milk or break a violin like Sellers. Inspector Clouseau lights the screen whenever he is on."
2,These reviews are crazy!,"The original Pink Panther is not what people are being made to believe with most of these reviews. Frankly, it is over long and rather boring. It's mildly amusing at best and it is the movie that started all the Pink Panther series, but it is not really very good. Peter Sellers is not playing the same character that he does in the 70s Panther films. The names the same and he's bumbling, but that's about it. It may be of historical interest for people interested in film history but that's about it. Pass."
4,The Pink Panther,A well known and previously enjoyed movie which has lost none of its charm and humor. Peter Sellers and david Niven as well as a young Robert Wagner all charm and delight!
4,VERY FUNNY!,"The Pink Panther (Blu-ray) Peter Sellers as Inspector Jacques Clouseau a very amusing clumsy laughable Character always falling over himself, literally, as he tries to stop the crime. A funny Movie with many funny moments, it made me laugh a lot, it did get a little slow at times, overall a very entertaining Film. The Blu-ray Disc comes with many Special Features:Audio Commentary by Writer/Director Blake EdwardsFeaturettes: The Pink Panther StoryBeyond the Feline: The Cartoon PhenomenonThe Coolest Cat in Cortina: Robert WagnerThe Tip-Toe Life of a Cat Burglar: A Conversation with former Jewel Thief Bill MasonDiamonds Beyond the SparkleAll of them very interesting and enjoyable, the Blu-ray transfer is nicely done so is the sound and with a Beautiful Legendary Music Score by Henry Mancini that you will be humming for days. The Places and Scenery are excellent specially seen them in a Big Screen, it made me wanted to get and collect the other Pink Panther Films! Thank You"
4,Madcap fun...........,"Stylish and sexy film successfully mixes humor and caper elementsin lavish settings with great Mancini soundtrack. The first of the Pink Panther series where Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau is one of several principal characters, which in this viewer's mind, makes for a superior outing. Excellent cast headed by David Niven, as legendary jewel thief, a young Robert Wagner as a wannabe jewel thief, Claudia Cardinale and Capucine as Clouseau's not terribly faithful wife, along with Peter Sellers. The initial credits introduce the Pink Panther cartoon character.A bit dated by today's standards but still fun. And again the Mancini soundtrack is first rate and one of the best stand alone soundtrack albums ever released."
1,most boring clouseau film of all,"Number one in the franchise and probably the most boring, this film takes ages to get going, and when it does is really anticlmactic. Clouseau has a minor role compared to the others."
1,Bad,No action it took too long we stopped it halfway through No action it took too long we stopped it halfway through
5,Loved it!,My review is simple. It was captivating. Enjoyed it from beginning to end. Highly recommend.
5,Great for the money,"I had the former version of this machine, and this one is better. The skip protection is better, as they've changed it from 25 seconds to 40 or 45 seconds, so it skips less. The sound quality is also better than on the older version. (Hopefully this one will also hold up better - the other one died after two years!)"
5,Best Portable CD player I've had,"I have had this player for many years and love it! I have dropped it countless times and it never skips, scratches my CD's or breaks. It's very durable. I have even had milk spill all over it inside and out and after it dried it worked great again! Highly recommend it to anyone."
2,Tall tales of the twenties with your host Jimmy Breslin,"On the book jacket of DAMON RUNYON: A LIFE there is the line, ""Much more than a biography."" Actually it is much less. Rather it is a colection of oft told tales of the roaring twenties, secondhand stories with little corroboration, and with little effort being made to set history straight. Runyon is just one of the many characters who captures Breslin's fancy, Pancho Villa, various mobsters, and ""colorful polticians all make appearences, with or without Runyon's presence. It's entertaining in the fact that Breslin always knew how to tell a story, but if you're actually looking for a biography...look elsewhere."

1,Damaged,"The poster came in a triangular like packaged that read ""received in damaged condition"" in red print all over the package. The poster was sticking out of the package and was bent/creased, you name it. Usually Poster Revolution ships in a circular tube-like package that keeps the poster from damaging and helps keep it in prime condition but for some reason they decided to send it in a package that would damage the poster, yes I know it makes no sense. While I sound like an angry customer, I am just upset that I have to pay for shipping to return it and will buy a new one because I really like the poster."
5,Goog bye Dewalt hello Makita,My friend who does all types of rehabs on new and older homes has a Dewalt 052 Impact driver. I used his Dewalr 052 drive on a recent job of mine. Then I started my own research about what really makes a great impact driver. The Makita 6980 has a great light for under sinks or anywhere you dont want to fool around with a flashlight or lighting system for a short job. The power at 1100 torque is great. The variable speed for slow starts on screws is what really sold me on this tool. The Dewalt 502 does not have a light or a variable speed . Sorry Dewalt no contest.Happy guy
3,Assembly prolonged by very poor instructions,"It says 1 hour instruction time. probably correct, however could be considerably reduced with better instructions. Also 2 small parts were missing."
2,Not for me.,"I love Equinox through Pieces and Eight, and even with Babe, there are a lot of good songs on Cornerstone. But this is just awful. The wheels came off the bus. They jumped the shark with this one, and went completely daffy with Kilroy.2 stars for Snowblind and Half-Penny Two-Penny. I think the rest is truly unlistenable."
4,This is a great album.....,"and CD. I still have the old vinyl of this and it is worn out. I have to admit it was a bit overdone, but I still really like it. Snowblind remains one of my all time favorites. What a powerful tune. There are some cheesy tunes but I also still like them. For new fans this is something you may want to check out. Actually if you like Styx at all this is a definite one that you will want."
4,not all that bad...,"But not as good as peices of eight. There is more pop rock in this one and less prog, but it is still pretty good. I don't have the cd but the record and the two holgraphic pictures on the record itself are pretty cool. So if you are a Styx fan and don't have this one or maybe a newbie of Styx, go get this one today."
2,hanna montana horror,"well.. i saw all the good reviews, it even came recommended by a fellow giallo fan, and boy did it cement my impression of manga, a hitherto little known genre to me (shallow wide-eyed teens panting-gasping-screaming..) i tried hard not to be put off by this, and waited for the suspense. i waited in vain. the cover mentions hitchcock - it comes nowhere near. the ending is not in the least interesting or dramatically relevant, but i guess it's enough if you're pretty in pink. i actually laughed as the main character got more and more flustered and the english subtitles got more and more absurd. as for the nudity it comes across as speculative and totally unnecessary.if you're not a manga-fan, think twice (=stay away)."
3,**SPOILER** The ending was WACK!!!,"To anyone who has read this book, I want you to be really honest with yourself. If YOUR mother was abusive to you AND opened up credit accounts around town in YOUR name...would you really collapse in her arms and say mommy I love you? Or would you take a bat and collapse her skull?Just askin'.The ending was totally unbelievable...meaning I didn't believe it one bit."
3,Good Read,"Even though I gave this book 3 stars, I did enjoy the book, but I must say ""Tumbling"" was FAR BETTER than this one. This book holds your interest but ""Tumbling"" pulls you in and you love every minute, every character, every word."
5,Very good! Much better than Tumbling.,I enjoyed this book tremendously! My bookclub chose it as our Feb. selection. I was apprehensive about the choice because I did not like Tumbling at all. It felt like events instead of a story. Tempest Rising was wonderfully warm and so amusing at times. Mc Kinney seems to be hitting her stride. I have already recommended this book to my mother and co-workers. Very well done!
3,disappointing,"This book is a formula Western, which is in itself is not a bad thing. However, the story is so implausable as to be absurd. How many stampedes can you have on one trail drive? How many shoot-outs with bandits? And an Indian attack all in the same day, just for good measure. Well-known historical characters are trotted out to lend an air of authenticity, Jesse Chisholm, William Quantrell (whom the main character wounds in a face off). Historical errors were a big distraction. The Shawnee Trail crossed the Red River at Rock Bluff just outside of Preston, TX, not at Doan's Store/Doan's Crossing 200 miles to the west. Reloading cartridges into a pistol on a galloping horse...in 1858, I think they were all muzzle loading revolvers. Who knew breech-loading Sharp's rifles were available in 1858? I guess these distractions pretty much ruined the story for me."
5,Kitties,"Perfect.... Just what I wanted. They may want to put cardboard in with it, my postman bent it in two. But not a big deal."
2,Not my style,"I recently bought these shooting stix and found that they just aren't my style. I usually shoot off of a pack or a bipod that is attached to my rifle, but I had to use the stix during an Antelope hunt due to high scrub. I guess it takes some practice to use these properly, which is something I didn't do. So take my review with that in mind, but if you, like me, are looking for something that is an easy substitute for a pack or a bipod, you may not be happy with using shooting stix."
5,Great power supply.,It runs my 26 year old Ibanez DLL Digital Delay and my Boss TU-12 guitar tuner. Its working wonderfully for me but I am not trying to run 20 pedals off it.
4,Shakespeare's Problem Plays,"These three plays include Measure for Measure which is about a man namedClaudio who is sentenced to die for having sexual relations before Church approval. Isabella, his sister, is pressured to have sex with Angelo, the Duke's Deputy in order to release Claudio. Will it work? Read or see the play in NY.All's Well is about a girl, Helena, who chases a cad named Bertram. Why do Shakespeare's women seek men beneath them?Troilus and Cressida are lovers when Troy and Greece are fighting over Helen. Cressida is ransomed over to the Greeks for a general. Will she remain faithful? Will Troilus get her back? Read this book.These plays introduce ring swapping and the infamous bedroom switcheroo--Who's really having sex with whom?For TROILUS knowledge of Homer's ILLIAD is helpful."
3,Marginally Good!,"This is a good CD if you are new to smooth jazz.It really doesn't measure up to ""real"" smooth jazz works but it gets an A for effort."
3,Okay Book,"There was some good parts but it seemed to take forever to get into the story. Just when i was getting into the book then another dry spell would be in the next chapter. There is alot of medical terminology that I would get lost in at times and then become uninterested, but over all an okay book if you are willing to wait until at least 1/2 through for it to start picking up."
5,Simply the Best Sci-Fi,Preston always fascinates me and the Cobra Event is no exception. An antiseptic look at an autopsy without missing a beat. My favorite book in over 3 years. I cannot wait for his next thriller.RX Horatio
3,"The reviews so far are sloppy; it's not as bad, not as good.","So far, the reviews I've read either gush or nit-pick. Agreed, both extremes have a point: the ""science"" is cool; and the writing is weak. In the first instance, cool subject matter never completely excuses mediocre writing. On the other hand, the prose isn't THAT bad. Read Marr's The Eleventh Plague for an example of really odiferous prose combined with two-dimensional characters and humdrum plotting! The Cobra Event is at least a viable alternative to watching sitcoms or listening to Uncle Fred's old viagra jokes."
4,This one will keep you up all night,"Richard Preston's Cobra Event will keep you up all night reading and then long afterwards as you ponder the significance of what you have read. A timely novel about genetically engineered germ warfare, Cobra Event is a fast-paced read. Mr. Preston inserts chapters about the world history regarding biological warfare, giving the reader much needed background and enhancing the story. Perhaps the main characters could have been ""fleshed out"" more fully, but any reader who criticizes Mr. Preston's storytelling ability is missing the point. This book is a wakeup call to the civilized world about the stand the world's governments have and are taking on biological warfare. Heed Mr. Preston's words and ignore the few shortcomings of a less than perfectly written novel."
3,Promising premise -- faulty execution,"Certainly not the worst book of this genre that I have read, but I am sad to write that the promising premise gave way to pedantic, ill-defined, stereo-typed characters and several loose plot threads that would most definitely have been worth exploring. For example, much menacing mileage could have been extracted from further encounters with the maniacal ""Concern"" -- this plot point was left out to dry like a dangling, sun-dried, wind-blown sheet. Most annoying were the definitions of bioweapon production and forensics ""industry terminology"". Most readers who are intrigued by this type of subject matter do not need the ""gloss"" definitions included within the body of the text. Perhaps one more round of editing and tweaking could have provided the book with the dangerous undercurrent that it lacked."
3,An excellent *attempt* by an otherwise excellent writer.,"I have always admired Richard Preston's analyses of some very complicated subjects, and my favorite by far was _The Hot Zone_. When I heard about _The Cobra Event_, I was thrilled, because anyone who is familiar with Preston's work knows that he is reliably accurate and intelligent in his examination of science.The problem is, he is not a novelist. Now, he doesn't do a bad job, and his skill as a writer saves him somewhat, but it reads like a sloppy attempt of an amateur novelist layered over exquisitely written and researched science.I can honestly say that while I was curious as all hell reading the book, I couldn't even remember the names of the characters as I was reading. Combine a copycat _Silence of the Lambs_ with _The Hot Zone_, and you have _The Cobra Event_.Despite all this, I certainly do intend to read more of his books. I just hope he sticks to nonfiction and not fiction in the future."
2,"An odd, poorly told story","The premise, biological terrorism from a rather prosaic source, had the skeleton of an enjoyable plot. But the author's odd temdency to break out of narrative and simply tell you what was going on or what something meant, broke the old fiction writer's rule of ""Show, don't tell."" The law enforcement characters seem to have been taught technique by the detectives who investigated the Jon-Benet Ramsey case (missing some obvious sources of information to track down their man). As the review above mentioned, the characters are rather cardboard --- the main character, Dr. Alice Austen, appears to be sleepwalking most of the time. And there are several gruesomely detailed autopsy scenes that even Bevis and Butthead would characterize as gratuitous. Rather than calling this book a ""page turner"" we found it to be a ""page skipper""."
5,The Cobra Event should be required reading.,"The Cobra Event by Richard Preston should be required reading for everyone. The true details of biological warfare are given in frightening detail. Knowing that such an event could actually happen is certainly an eye opening experience. Perhaps if everyone read this, more attention would be given to peace seeking instead of mindless plots to rule the world."
2,"Good journalism, bad literature",Preston's skill is in presenting factual material in a dramatic way. But this talent is dissipated in fiction because it's very difficult for the reader to know what's real and what he's just made up. Add to this a complete inability to evoke character and creaky dialogue and you have a rather unsatisfactory novel. I much preferred his New Yorker articles to anything in this effort.
3,Good forensics; weak structure,"While finding the story of genetically manufactured viruses fascinating, I couldn't help noticing that the characters seemed cardboard and the author also slips in and out of past and present tense. The story holds interest, but I agree that the romance is weak and almost a sop to current popular publishing practices. The best part is the detailed medical knowledge that the author gives which makes the story seem likely and very frightening. But I do wonder if it is as simple to manufactor that stuff in an apartment as he made out? Wouldn't the landlord notice?"
3,It was an average thriller.,"I don't get into required reading for shcool, and like to pick out my own book, however this was a descnet choice. I predicted a great book of creativity and lots of new litature from Richard Preston, and from many sources it looked to be different, however I believed it to be dull and uncreative, like it was copied from your basic thriller. Nevertheless the details and diction seems to bring it back to life. So i really cant decide if i liked it or not, so read it and decide for yourself, i thought it to be average."
4,Good Scary Thriller,This is a good scary thriller -- especially given what's going on in the real world now. Mr. Preston also gives uss information about how biological weapons are created and work. His story is believable and you care about the characters. I'd like to read another novel with Austen and Hopkins.
2,"Fun, but no masterpiece.","This book is easy to read, fun and flows well. That's about it. There is some modest success at character development, but nothing to shout about. Worth reading for the fun. Don't have high expectations. Not as interesting or exciting as THE HOT ZONE."
5,Reality Check,"This book was written for a scientific audience in the 90's. I am one of those readers that has to have all of the facts straight, or I cannot read something. This book is completly scentific!!! Everything, even years later, is still completly plausable. A great read for anyone up for a truthful thrill."
4,Great game and a lot of fun,"I was waiting for a good rally game with some challenging AI. There it is, this game is great, the AI is pretty good and will not let you go easily. This is far better than V-Rally 3 which was way too easy.Rally fusion is fun especially in multiplayer with all those different racing modes. The fact that you have to earn the new cars is great even if sometime it s much more time consuming than difficult.anyway, if you want to have fun, get this game. The one I am waiting for after rally fusion is Colin Mcrae 3 :)"
1,Ew! Boring!,"Ugh, I didn't even finish watching this movie. It's incredibly *BORING*. We enter the movie with two people halfway through a conversation, and it gets more confusing from there. The plot is minimal, at best, and the movie is basically a bunch of idiotic nonsensical conversations and sex scenes. Forunately, they weren't at the same time. Avoid this trash at all costs."
5,Tokyo Mew Mew A La Mode,"This book is exiting, and is one of stay up all night reading it books. Very romatic. Tokyo Mew Mew A La Mode, Vol.2, is the best of the two books out yet."
1,Not an especially good read.,"After being spoiled by Goodkind, Hobb, McKiernan, Fallon...this was not what I was expecting. Interesting ideas, but not terribly well-organized or easy to read. I bought the first, I won't buy any more."
2,blah,"I wouldn't say this was a BAD book--well, not an AWFUL book--but it definitely was not a very compelling story. I didn't finish it (I know, you're thinking, ""don't knock it till you've read it!"") but this is one of the few books that has EVER failed to hold my interest until the end. It's not romantic, even in the love scenes; it's not exciting, even in the chase scenes; it's not filled with interesting concepts, even in the ""magic"" scenes... It's just bland, bland, bland."
4,Enjoyable game,"I was impressed with the amount of time and energy spent in keeping the feeling of the show present in the game. The artistic backgrounds and characters are nicely done. I found the gathering of weapons and specials fun- although I was bummed I didn't get to use all of them. My only complaint was the ending was a little abrupt and not very challenging (possibly to keep things pumping for a sequel). Overall a fun pocket game, with great graphics, and a creative feel."
4,Rainbow Sandals hemp white,I like the sandals I feel they are smaller than what I was expecting but I have gotten used to them nowThe off white colored ones I bought dirty up way to easily but it is good quality
5,Great Even For Occasional Usage...,"I bought this because I wanted good-quality color prints. Color lasers print photos poorly, and I use a printer at home too infrequently to justify an inkjet as ink would dry out between uses.This works beautifully. However, EXPENSIVE ink refills. But so are color lasers' toner cartridges. Nonetheless, SUPER-FAST. And GORGEOUS output.One note: if you print infrequently as well, make sure to set the printer to only warm up when jobs are coming in. Out of the box it is set to warm up daily--and that will simply eat up ink. And electricity."
5,Appreciation for An Appreciation,"Better than any other book about Jane Austen's craft that I have read, this book puts Ms. Austen's accomplishments in perspective. Jenkyns eliminates much of the superfluous agenda that other modern critics have devised in order to put Austen in her place. His explications leave his reader with a greater understanding of how it happens that Austen's work continues to delight us and why it is possible that it has inspired so many other works of fiction. I originally bought this to read on my Kindle. But I later bought a hardcover version for easier use of the index."
1,Worst Xbox Title..period,"I can't believe how bad this game is. All the previews and demos made it look great. Then I actually bought the game and was completely disappointed.The graphics are ok, though too polygonal and plastic for my liking. The gameplay is beyond simple, just walk around a randomly generated dungeon and kill things. Combat is handled automatically by the computer, or you can do some basic manual control to fight the enemies off, but not much.There is literally no plot. You just hack around the dungeons killing things."
1,damn u capcom,"this just flat out ..., unless u like to be bored.it has no battle system--its all automatic.i couldent stand it for 2 hours - - - - i literaly threw all ... to the salvation army [like they would have an x-box for the poor]"
3,Killer vs Butch Dyke,"This was recently ran on one of my premium channels and I thought I would give it a view. The original from the 50's with Robert Wagner was soo much better than this fantasy. Matt Dillon who has never been considered a serious actor, plays a psycho killer who grows up poor and wants untold riches and success. Sean Young who apparently needed money for rent appears as the one twin who Dillon throws off the roof of an office tower. Next we see Young as the ""other"" twin looking like a total butch dyke who we are supposed to believe has fallen in love with Dillon. This film leans more to being a comedy instead of the intended thriller. Young look's like a total lesbian throughout the remainder of the film to the point that I expected ""Sister George"" to pop up on screen and assist Young in rubbing out Dillon. To be enjoyed more for fun than fear."
5,Excellent for decorating tips and gift ideas,"I was looking for something to inspire me for Holiday/Christmas ideas. This book has it all! From table decorations to window treatments to desserts, you can apply your own imagination to the ideas also."
3,Very helpful for a beginner such as I.,I don't know how good this is because I don't have much to compare it to. I am a beginner and it is helpful to me. What more can I ask for? It doesn't leap me forward but helps me to begin.
1,terrible,"Dull, trite and absolutely riddled with errors. Don't let students read this. Get McCullough's and make them plow through it."
5,Beautiful scenery but boring; cruelty to seagulls was appalling,"No, I'm not a teenager in search of violent emotions. But this movie was unbearably slow, and as beautiful as images of flying birds and clouds can be, there is only so much one can take at a time. The music is another great problem... it's so corny I had to turn the volume down several times.It wasn't very faithful to the book, and several scenes were just made up, while beautiful lines from the book were left out.But my great problem with this film is how they made it... there was no CGI at the time, so they really hurt and killed seagulls to get the scenes done. I really couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it. How can they take a book with a deeply spiritual message and harm so many animals to make a movie? I wish I had never seen it, and I will never show it to my children. I'll make them read the book, instead, which is indeed phenomenal."
1,The Book's Author Sued to have his name removed from the movie.,"The direction being taken by the last two ""Harry Potter"" films in moving farther and farther afield from the books even to adding scenes not in the books, reminded me of this movie ""Jonathan Livingston Seagull"".The author was appalled that the movie's resemblance to his book was only the name. The author unfortunately discovered that he had absolutely no control over how his beloved book wasn't brought to the ""Big Screen"". He sued the production company to have the title of the movie changed and his name removed from the credits. He lost on the movie's name, he won and his name and all reference to his book was deleted from the film credits.This may be a good movie in and of itself. But, if you have read and love the book, this movie is a big disappointment. Just ask the book's author."
3,"Wonderful Movie, Crappy conversion to DVD","I read the book and I loved it. Then I heard there was a movie about this, so I did some research and found the movie here at amazon. Reading other reviews, it was clear that the conversion to DVD was poorly done.Well, the reviews are right. The movie is stunning, the story is beautiful, the photography is spectacular, the Soundtrack great, and the sound... Well, the sound is what took two stars away from my review.Paramount should be ashamed of letting such a wonderful movie, where the soundtrack is basically half of everything, being release with no work at all at the sound quality. Zero, zero. The sound is MONO, and looks like somebody took an old voice recorder into the movie theater hidden in his pocket and recorded the whole thing.I think this movie deserved a little more time and money dedicated to create a better package.But still, the movie is worth it. I will complain at Paramount's site about this."
1,Cult of JLS,"I saw this movie in the theater during its first release when I was in grade school. I remember at the time, the book had a bizarre, cultish following - some teachers even mandated that very young students read it - not to examine it as any other literary work - but for the purpose of betterment and enlightenment - like the book was a cult leader's manifesto. My parents made me go to this movie with my older brother. Even at my young age, I recognized the movie as being meandering, ridiculous, seemingly pointless and ultimately very boring. What I DID learn was this - my parents were probably on something back in 1973."
5,TRANSCENDENT!,"JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL, a terrific uplifting book about finding the best in others and in ourselves, was a movie that required a very special soundtrack. It got exactly what it needed from Neil Diamond. Though released years ago this album is still as vibrant and soaring and transcendent as it ever was. Wonderful vocal renditions by Neil Diamond such as BE, LONELY LOOKING SKY, DEAR FATHER and SKYBIRD are simply marvelous and add to these the wonderful orchestral tracks of the same titles and you have a soundtrack that will have you coming back again and again.THE HORSEMAN"
5,Quickest way to sand drywall w/o all the dust!,I have a couple of these and they are the most convenient way to sand drywall - whether you're working in a finished house or it's still empty the dust is contained in your vacuum and everyone will be a whole lot happier. I only wish more local retailers would carry these in stock - at about $5 more than the regular hand sander I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't buy one.Get one and never look back.
1,The Hatchet Does NOT Work,I received the Milwaukee combo and straight out of the box the Hatchet didn't work unless you tap on it. Apparently it has a short and now I have to hassle with finding a Milwaukee dealer who will repair it- not exactly what i intended on when spending almost 500 bucks on a combo-i want Milwaukee to reimburse me for my time and effort!
4,SAMMU DAVIS JR,The cd was very good. I enjoyed listening to Sammy Davis Jr. It is nice backgroundmusic when your watching sports.
5,the breakthrough...,"""Control"", undoubtedly,was Janet's breaktrough cd. After having 2 albums, ""Dream Street"" and ""Janet Jackson"", Janet teamed up with the Jimmy Jam and Terry Louis from ""the Time"" to make her 1986 release, ""Control"". With approx. 2/3 of the album being hits, you can't really go wrong. Janet well explained her indpendency as an artist despite her family background. She was, for certain, known for being a child actress on such sitcoms as ""Diff'rent Strokes"" and ""Fame"", as well as being the youngest member of the legendary Jackson clan. She well expresses her state of being in control, hence the title. It's a great pop/r&b cd, and a good album for the 80s. It is a relatively good dance cd, but ""Rhythm Nation"" is better for dancing. There are many up-beat cds, and an overall good album."
3,"One of the best Pop albums of all time, but def. not her best!","I actually really like all the songs on this cd. Some of them are a bit corny. And there's one or two tracks that are a bit too outdated for me. When I think of You especially. My favorite tracks are Nasty and What Have you Don't for me lately! Wow some of the best dance pop songs of all time! I can def. see why these songs made her a star. Control is so-so, the video has a great message, and you kind of see the underlying effect her dad had on their lives. Pleasure Pricnple was always kind of boring to me. I know people say it's a classic,but I think she's done alot better. I think this has to be one of the classic pop albums of all time, but this is not her best work. I thought her next two albums would be her best. This album should be bought if your into 80's music or are a pop music fan. There's very little r and b on this cd."
5,janet,I love all of Janet's work and would recommend it to anyone who does and I'm a big fan and have all of her CD's
5,The best Jackson,Janet has definintly come a long way since CONTROL and she is still dancing and singing her way up the charts.
1,NOT better than Silence....NOT even close,"This movie was seriously one of the worst 80's movies I've ever seen...Thomas Harris should be offended and embarrassed his name even appears in this pathetic adaptation of his book. Mann's horrendous use of equally horrendous music ruins a big part of the movie...the rest of the movie is ruined by the horrible acting, editing, and screen play. While the book was suspenful, scary, gory and amazing this movie does not even hold a flame to the original writing. The ending was by far the most offensive aspect...I mean who the hell sees the killer and instead of shooting decides to crash through the window??? This movie is too horrible to even laugh at...I was upset that I lost two hours of my life to this awful waste of film..."
3,"An OK movie, a GREAT book","I knew about how Red Dragon was the first of the Hannibal trilogy, so I bought it. When I had finished reading it, I loved it and decided to rent the DVD. Well, it wasn't very good. It was well acted, well directed, but the writing .... They changed a really good ending from the book to a ... one in the movie. So if you thought the movie was just OK, and your a huge Silence of the Lambs fan, then read the book!"
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"I remember the Manhunter movie vaguely, so when this DVD came out, I was hesitant to buy it. I am a huge fan of ""Silence..."" and of all Thomas Harris's novels, but I remember the movie being somewhat uneventful. But after reading all the reviews, I figured it was worth another look. WRONG! Those who think this is a superior movie to ""Silence"" are just trying to either cash in on all the hype surrounding ""Hannibal"" or trying to seem fashionably elitist! Brian Cox is good as Lector, but none of the performances last in memory. Good cop drama, but not a thriller."
4,Miami Vice Meets the Silence of The Lambs,"As a big fan of Miami Vice, I enjoyed this movie, mainly because I enjoy the style of music that Michael Mann uses, it is very similar to the way Jan Hammer would score a Miami Vice episode. Also the clothes are very similar to the show, they are both outfitted by Hugo Boss. Now this movie is not anything like Hannibal, which is absolutely horrible or Silence of the Lambs which won Best Picture. Take the 7 minutes that Lecter is actually in the film out and no one would realize that this film had anything to od with the other two. Michael Mann created his own version of Red Dragon through his own 80's pop culture/Miami Vice look. You are given a look into the mind of an FBI officer who becomes the killer to catch the killer. This in turn makes the movie very dark, and the pace becomes very slow. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a dark thriller with a lot of music throughout the movie.......B"
5,One of the Best Thrillers Around-Criminally Underrated Film,"One of the best thrillers ever. Far superior to the overrated Silence of the Lambs. William Peterson is intense as Will Graham, and Dennis Farina's Jack Crawford puts Scott Glenn to shame (no offense to Glenn). Unfortunately not a well known film, although it got some attention after Silence was released. Everyone I recommend this to loves it. On my top ten list of movies I would like to see on DVD with special features."
3,Not bad,"I dont know if it is just me but the quality of the stream was very poor. Far below a normal DVD. As for the movie I can certainly see why this movie did not get as much notoriety as The Silence of the Lambs. But no, its not a bad movie. Sadly, I didn't enjoy this film or Red Dragon as much as i did SOTL or Hannibal."
1,Now I know why it's not called Red Dragon,"This movie is based on the book Red Dragon by Thomas Harris (who wrote silence of the lambs, etc.). The book in my opinion is incredible. It's far better than silence of the lambs or hannibal. I couldn't put the book down once I started reading it. So I was really excited to see Manhunter to see how it compares. Well it sucked! I was wondering why the movie wasn't called the same as the book but now I see it must have been because the author objected. In summary, the director chose all the least interesting parts of the book to put in the movie and even substituted the book's great ending with a really mediocre ""miami vice"" style ending. Which I guess was to be expected since the director also did miami vice... Don't buy this dvd, you'll be selling it on ebay soon just like I am err sorry I meant to say ""amazon actions"". Sorry to say the e-word."
4,Fine the way it is.,"Scary, dark, moody and deep.This film SHOULD NOT BE REMADE.It was fine the way it is.Brian Cox's Lecter is just as creepy as Hopkins.Wm. Petersen is incredibly sympathetic and beliveble.This is a fine scary little film. Much more belivable than more recent productions."
2,It must be a JOKE !,"After reading other peoples opinions, I directly bought that film...But it was a terrible suprise for me! I love to collect serial killer films and if I have to compare this film with SE7EN or Silence Of The Lambs, this is just an ordinary film which has no massive impression."
4,Articulated clone trooper,Beware - some of these have stuck parts - and forcing the movement of the wrist will cause the figure to be handless. I bought 10 and two were bad. Awesome figure but QC seems to be lacking
4,The Dickies ahead of the Ramones!,"The Dickies album ""Dawn Of The Dickies"" can be described as an album that was ahead of their time and ahead of the Ramones. This Dickies album sounds like what the Ramones did on their 1980 album with Phil Spector entitled ""End of the Century"". Were the Ramones influenced by this album? I don't know, but the songs reminded me of ""Do you remember Rock and Roll Radio?"" by the Ramones. With that being said, the Dickies were original and ahead of their time. The album is full of good songs with good hooks and silly lyrics. This album came out years before those ripoff artists like ""Green Day"", ""Offpspring"", ""Blink 182"" and any other ""Boy Band With Guitars"" that claim to be ""punk"" came to be. This is a great lost gem and should be purchased by any fan of good music. Don't let their label (punk) fool you, these guys are much more than that. They write great melodies and music. So don't waste your time and buy this album."
5,Simply the BEST Xmas album ever produced!,"Finally, THE Xmas album has been re-released! Thanks to the powers that be! This is simply a must-have for all Feliciano fans everywhere and it should make some non-believers believe that ""Yes, there really is a SANTA CLAUS!"" The album is balanced with soft instrumentals showcasing Jose's great guitarmanship, such ""White Christmas"" and lively Xmas songs with Jose's unique vocals, such as his magnificent composition, ""Feliz Navidad."" The ""Cherry Tree Carol"" is a beautiful song that sends shivers up ones spine as you listen to it. Likewise, with ""Little Drummer Boy""! Whether sipping some wine or mulled cider near the fireplace or entertaining family and friends, there is something on this album for everyone.As a special bonus, this album has 3 never released songs on it. Jose's ""Jingle Bells"" puts a whole new rhythm and twist on this carol. Our holidays don't begin until we put this CD on!"
5,Best thing Joe ever did,"As a Gosport, Hampshire boy who went to London with the punk and new wave revolutions in the 70's and is now a long way from home in the US this is a great flashback and the best thing Joe ever did .. definite reminders of the John Peel pub"
4,"Looks sharp, sounds sharp","Joe Jackson's first two albums have always represented, to me, what was good about the New Wave/No Wave splash of the late '70s to early '80s. LOOK SHARP was Joe Jackson's impressive first dive into those waters. Although not as consistently engrossing as his next album, I'M THE MAN, this album was a great introduction to the contradictory, self-conscious attitude of late '70s pop. Alternating between comic and pathetic, like ""Is She Really Going Out With Him?"" to ""Fools in Love"", the album does have an interesting range. The title cut is probably the most self-conscious in the sense that it figuratively asks, ""How should I look and/or behave in this post-punk world? What is the new attitude?"" I had just turned twenty when this album came out and, for that reason alone, this cut spoke to me. I worried about having to look ""over my shoulder"" too.The DVD has a great sound and the accompanying goodies make it well worth the very reasonable price."
2,It's not his best for sure,I had seen 15 degrees off Cool - hilarious. So I thought I would get another DVD. It was not what I expected - it wasn't funny at all.
2,"Loved White Ladder, hate Lost Songs",I bought Lost Songs because I love every song on White Ladder. But every song on Lost Songs is flat and uninteresting by comparison.
5,These speakers are super clear and pump!,"So i bought this speaker not knowing what to expect, never really heard of the brand. Well after i received the product i was amazed at how loud and clear of a sound it produced. Just get a decent amp to power these puppies. I ordered another one right after and plan to put them in my doors. There 250 watts 125 rms, but they sound good with even just 60 rms going to them. I deff would recommend them to anyone for such a low price almost the same if not better than seleniums."
4,An enjoyable look at a wordless book.,"The book was worth looking at. Nothing spectacular, but it was a solid 4 star read (look). I know this isn't much of a review, but I hope the rating helps onlookers."
2,Poor adhesive,Had to order a second mirror after the first one simply fell off. The adhesive provided with the mirror is weak. Buy some strong adhesive from Home Depot or somewhere and attach this mirror and all will be well.
4,No Lessons Learned!,"Yes Sasha Borianni is back, and she has not changed! Still up to the same games, juggling multiple men at the same time. No... she has not learned any lessons from her previous experiences. Sasha has excelled in her business and is still beautiful and sexy. But when it comes to men she is blind and reckless. I was a little disappointed at Sasha, but we all have to go though many different phases in our lives until we come to a place where we feel comfortable with ourselves. Read about Sasha's adventures and see if she finally finds what she has been searching for. If you have read ""Threesome"" then ""Fourplay"" is a must read for you. Keep up the great work Brenda."
3,Could've been better,I thought that the book could've been better. It seemed a bit rushed as if there was too many things going on at one time to fit them in adequately.
4,Battery life is poor,"I have been using the Free-Speak for non-bluetooth phones with my T-Mobile Sidekick 1 for about 8 months. Overall, I like it a lot. My only complaints are the battery life of the adapter and the flashing blue lights. The battery drains very fast and those blue lights drive me crazy. They flash constantly! Other than those things, I've been very pleased."
2,"Wonderful, but only for a short time","This headset was great, so was the second one I bought. But both lasted only around 6 months and then would no longer hold a charge. I just tried another Jabra product with a cord, and sure enough, didn't work after about 6 months. I'm one of those people who open a package and then throw the package out as well as the receipt (I believe Jabra has a 1 year warranty). Learn from my stupidity - save your receipt."
4,Dropped calls in your room!,"I've been using the Jabra product with my Samsung phone for about a month and it's great. I'm in the military so I travel a great deal. I often find myself in a barracks room or hotel room with a crappy signal. With the Jabra headset I can place my phone near a window or in any ""good"" spot in the room and move around freely. I used to drop important calls on a regular basis while just setting at a desk (and let me tell you, having to explain to a General that you ""lost the signal"" is not a good feeling plus I hated calling some company's customer service line and being placed on hold for 15 or 20 minutes just to end up loosing the signal and having to start all over)..now that problem is a thing or the past. I strongly recommend this produt."
1,Battery useless just over a year after purchase,"I've had this product just over a year and had decent success using it w/ my Sony Erickson T610. I didn't use it much, however, and now it's practically useless, cause the battery runs out after 20-30 minutes of use (and starts beeping before that). Since I didn't use it much, I'm guessing I recharged the battery 20-30 times at most. Since you can't replace the battery, that means it's time to buy another, but it wont be a Jabra!"
1,Don't waste your money...,I bought one of these and returned it after 2 days. The headset kept loosing connectivity with the adapter (I have a non-bluetooth phone) When I wore the adapter on one side and the headset in the opposite ear it disconnected almost constantly. When I moved the adapter and headset to the same side of my body it was better but it still frequently disconnected. My wife also complained that the sound quality was poor when I was using the headset. On the good side it is very comfortable and fairly easy to use once I got used to it. It also took advantage of Nokia phones ability to answer and hangup calls from the headdset. The coolness factor is good. Too bad it doesn't live up to its promise but I have had similar results from other Jabra products.As soon as I can find the Plantronics version I will give it a try...
1,This is really bad,"I used if for one hour and that is all I could take. There was much too much static and the people I called said it was noisy too. Also, it was too hard to turn it on."
2,Not AT ALL What I Remembered...,"Part of the reason why I was disappointed with this, is my own fault. I used to watch this when I was younger, and thought it was amazing. Watching it now, as a nineteen year old... I realize I was naive. Apart from the less-than-stellar acting, the production itself is laughable. I could have filmed this on my digital camera and it would have looked better. The camera operator often shakes through the movie, and the sound is a bit off. I wouldn't recommend spending money on this!"
3,What is up with the graphics?,"Overall, the game plays well. It's not perfect, but what game is? My big issue is with the graphic flaws that I am running into:At times, the movement in the game becomes very choppy.During game play, the player's feet will disappear into the court, making them look like they are standing in quicksand.The arenas stink. EA should have done a much better job in capturing the individuality of each home court. EA NCAA Football set the bar for this.The game is good, but compared to NCAA Football, it is lacking. I know the graphics thing might be small potatoes to some, but when I spend $.. on a game, the video needs to be quality.Also, for all the people crying about the name thing. The NCAA prohibits the use of any student athlete's image to sell a product. If EA used the players names, they would be in violation of this policy, so get use to it."
4,For the Musician,"Most music lovers admire the Police, either for their pop sensibility or for their expert musicianship. While 'Regatta De Blanc' and 'Synchronicity' bring out a more radio- friendly Police, this album emphasizes their musicianship. Many of the tunes discuss political and social issues and have a jazzy sound. The only exceptions are ""Spirits in the Material World"" and ""Everything She Does Is Magic."" This album is for particular tastes, but still maintains enough pop appeal to make it a worthy purchase for anyone."
3,"This isn't so dark, just different!","First off, I hope everyone knows by now that the cover of the Cd actually features numerical characitures of the band. They are from left to right, Stuart, Sting, & Andy.Now, about this Cd; it was often panned for being bleak. Sting himself said that they had to add Every Little Thing She Does is Magic to lighten up the mood.Far be it from me to disagree w/the writer of the songs, but I don't see it that way.This album is like the title of one of its cuts;Secret Journey. Nothing is really Goth here, or depressing. It's more futuristic. In fact Demolition Man & Omegaman sound like s/f titles. But Spirits in the Material World and Rehumanize yourself are more about introspection than self-destruction.This cd also includes the anthem of freedom used by many globally opressed people these days, Invisible Sun.Again, I feel there are a few too many throw aways such as Too Much Information and darkness to be a 5 star effort! Next, Synchronicity. Read on...."
3,Some high points but overall disappointing,"""Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic"" remains my all-time favorite Police song to this day, but unfortunately the rest of this recording is uneven and sounds like it was put together by a band an album away from breaking up."
3,"Great performance, OK Sound","This album is in my opinion one of Dylan's best. Recorded live with the Band, Dylan is singing with strength and conviction like he really means it. I wore the record out and decided to get a 'brilliantly' remastered CD of it. But unlike many modern remasters this sounds to me like it was made from the mix-down tape, not the original, and it has much of the harshness of early CD's made from the 2 track mix-downs that were originally used to produce vinyl records. Also, appears to suffer from dynamic range limiting for vinyl. Still, for the price, it was worth it."
5,An auburn album,"This is one of my favorite Dylan albums. It is not one of his most famous ore most astounding. None of the songs is very famous. It is not a musical breakthrough. But it has something intimate to it, that some of his other albums lack.This album is like a brown-haired, simple, but mysterious girl (Hazel?). No gorgeous blonde or sensual mediterranean. It is a cute auburn, that needs to be discovered.And the album is like a discovery. From the fancy ""On A Night Like This"" (the night we meet Hazel?), to the thoughtful ""Forever Young"", up to the more intimate last songs, crowned by the beautiful ""Wedding Song""."
3,I bought this CD for Forever Young...,"... one of my all time favorite Dylan tunes. The rest is well... forgettable. It's obviously hard to really go *wrong* with Dylan, but this is far from his best work overall."
4,The odd Dylan album,"Bob Dylan (and The Band) / Planet Waves: This is a very quirky album from Dylan but is very entertaining nonetheless. There are a few great songs here and a few so-so efforts as well, but it is still one that I really enjoy listening to. Four Stars"
4,Renee and Kit forever!,"As kids, we taped this off of HBO and regardless of the video quality, this became a family favorite. Catchy tunes and fun little stories make this a great video for kids, and the parodies of Mohammid Ali and Rocky keep the parents entertained as well. I agree with Leonard Maltin, however, in the opinion that it could have been kept to under an hour."
5,Absolutely adorable!!!,Animalympics is one of my most favorite cartoons of all time! It is a great video to watch with children and/or revisit as an adult. Buy it!
5,Best of its genre,"As the mother of a depressed adult woman, I've read several books in an attempt to understand what SHE is dealing with, and how it is affecting the rest of the family. Many books deal with the depressed person's problems, and there are a few that focus specifically with the people whose lives are directly affected by the depressed person...spouses, parents, children, friends, in particular. This one will have you nodding your head in agreement, it acknowledges your need to protect your own mental health, and it gives you concrete ideas, through very readable and interesting case studies, for ways you can help the depressed individual and help yourself survive it."
5,How You Can Survive When They're Depressed : Living and Copi,"I am presently going through a divorce from a depressive. Anne Sheffield's book has been a godsend for me. Even after a year in counseling, and being in school towards a degree in counseling, I blamed myself for all the failures, including the eventual death of the marriage. This book has set me free. I'm actually feeling blessed that she choose to leave. Lots of Christians say, read the Bible during times like this. This book has helped me to understand and believe what the Bible says. Because of this book, I can, for the first time, ACCEPT, deep in my spirit, that it wasn't all my fault. If you are in ANY kind of relationship with a depressed person, buying, reading and APPLYING this book will change your life. Do something for YOU for a change."
5,Mary Swann,"""Mary Swann"" was my introduction to the wonderful writing of Carol Shields. Back in the 80s, my knowledge of Canadian writers was limited to Margaret Atwood. In my opinion Shields is every bit as good. This intriguing story is about the mysterious rural poet, Swann, whose very identity seems to fade as others try to find out about her life and work, and how she came to write such haunting poetry within a harsh rural environment and a repressive marriage. The characters seeking to solve Mary Swann's enigma all project their own versions of her life upon their quest, but she eludes them all. The novel is a fine mystery, which explores just how difficult it is to truly know another person, and also touches on the often self-serving nature of literary scholarship."
4,blasters hand book,"Nice binding but the quality of the print was only fair. Not real crisp and clear, same for the graphics."
2,Never a quiet moment,"First, let me say that the 2 stars are not for the musical contents of the CD. That would have been 5-plus stars of course.No, the 2 stars are for the terrible job the folks at A&M have done digitally remastering this album. Or should I say de-analogizing? The sound is much too harsh, and too loud. Just compare the first minute of ""Give a little bit"" with the original (LP or CD) release and you'll know what I mean.I had the entire remastered collection in my ""save for later"" basket, but decided to delete them all after listening to thisone. I'll stick to the more analog sounding (and still very defined) first releases.For the record: I listened to this CD on my Electrocompaniet EMC1 with 24/192 upsampling, with the Rogers E40a and a pair ofLS3A's with AB1 subwoofers."
4,Congratulations! You just found something wonderful!,"I'm sure you are familiar with Supertramp from Breakfast In America or possibly Crime Of The Century (both most have albums). Well, this CD is right up there as being one of the greatest Supertramp recordings. For my money, Supertramp was on fire during these years and was pumping out some seriously good music. Fool's Overture - turn it up, lay back and be amazed!"
4,"Scary, but fun at the same time.","Being a huge fan of horror survival/role playing games, it was obvious that I had to have this one.The graphics are pretty good, but what really gets you is the soundtrack and background noises as you explore the the castle looking for clues, and avoiding ghosts.The ghost images are rather good. Just enough gore for horror fans, and enough cryptic messages for suspense lovers.I recommend this game if single person survival is your gig."
2,Not professional quality,"I think these aren't worth the trouble. The templates are not very user friendly and the output does not look professional. Better to just get the job done by a printing shop - not much more expensive, better quality, and no headaches."
4,Easy and no mess!,"I was a little adamant about how heavy or how big this litter box would be (I live in a 2bedroom apt), but it fits nicely in the corner, and it's easy to use. I was surprised that it did not leave a mess when i cleaned out the litter. Anway, it's simply practical, and I think it's worth the purchase."
3,"Concept work, product hard to keep together.","Overall the main concept of this box is a good one and after watching the instructional video someone did on line here it was pretty easy and it does clean litter the way it claims to BUT the two pieces never really snapped together from the start and with time even a generous amount of tape to seal it still meant litter everywhere. Once sealed with tape it is hard to put in new litter. Box is very large and works well. I tried this instead of getting an automated scooper. Wishing I spent the big bucks and gone the other route. Also if you manage to get a box with a better seal and snap and have any kind of bad back, knee pain physically maneuvering the box by rocking it is not the best idea. Full of litter to capacity and the angle you are at is not back breaking but if you are half way there this small motion over and over again might be enough to finish the job."
3,Make sure you have a roll of strong duct tape!,"I would love to give this box five stars, and I would have, if two out of the three I purchased had not broken already (two months). The box is simple to clean and is a lot easier on my back and arm BUT the little plastic clips that hold the lid tight (and all of the litter inside the box) break VERY easily. You don't know they are broken until you roll the box over and roll it back to reveal a huge pile of litter on the floor! A simple piece of strong duct tape has fixed the problem, and the boxes are still usable, but what a huge pain. I went ahead and taped up the third one just to be sure."
1,Scooping is easier in the long run.,"This seemed very clever and fun at first and worked well but then the screen got clogged and also, using World's Best Litter, attracted lots of pantry moths who hid out behind the slotted screen where all kinds of clumped litter also was hiding which somehow didn't fall into the drawer as it was supposed to when I turned it the box upside down. It's much harder to clean than an ordinary litter box - the screen gets clogged so easily. I'm going back to scooping - it's quicker and cleaner."
5,"YES, BUY THIS PRODUCT !!!","I adopted a large cat and a kitten from the Animal Shelter and the baby took to it without problem, the big cat will take a couple of more days but he's getting there. The DUST from the litter is ZERO, the ease of cleaning the litter box AWESOME! MY 5 year old son BEGS, yes BEGS to clean it! He loves turning it over and pulling the drawer out. So PERFECT !!"
3,"A terrific idea, but....","This is a great idea - but read the directions for installation. I know that's a dumb thing to say, but my daughter anxiously put it together, filled it with litter and let the kitten go in it. Then she realized the grate to sift the litter wasn't inside the lid... Multiple calls and e-mails to OmegaPaws were fruitless, until I finally got through to a human who graciously said they'd send the missing part. So check the parts before you unwrap everything so that you can return it to Amazon, rather than try to get through to customer service at OmegaPaws."
1,"A good idea, that doesn't work!","Length:: 1:47 MinsDuring the first few days of use I was very satisfied, but after a few weeks I'm going to trash this product. I'm usually very satisfied with products I buy on Amazon.com, and highly trust user reviews; however, this products fails. It takes up more space, requires extra cleaning, and spill kitty litter. See my video - DO NOT BUY!!"
2,"great idea, but this product falls short","The clamp seal that keeps the lid on is not secure enough to prevent bits of litter from escaping every time you flip it over. I use super clumping litter, but the action of rolling the container always breaks up the urine clumps - thus mixing it back in the the ""clean"" litter to go back into the container. Also, my cats don't seem to like it. I basically have resorted to scooping out the urine clumps which defeats the purpose of this container."
2,Breaking plasic tabs - is of no use after they break,"I've broken two of the plastic tabs that hold this together. I broke one and have been very careful since. Well, I just broke another one and was not using any excessive force. If the clips are broken then the whole system doesn't work. I used a zip tie on the first broken one and was still able to get into the container to fill it, wash, etc. Now I will have to snip off one of the zip ties to get into the container. There is no reason to buy this product if this problem is not fixed. If the tabs are fixed then this product works well."
2,Not what I hoped it would be :-[,"I ordered this since I have 3 cats and cleaning the litter box isn't exactly my favorite job.Anyway,I hoped that it would be everything people in the reviews raved about.It did work as promised,but kitty litter ended up coming out of the box and getting on the throw rug I use beneath my kitty box creating a further mess.The box is very sturdily made.I finally decided to remove the drawer and screen and use it as a regular kitty box instead of simply tossing it.At least that way my investment isn't a total waste."
3,The concept is wonderful but...,"I have had the product for a couple of months and although the concept is wonderful, the actual product is extremely shoddy. The clips won't stay in place and the litter leaks out every time I clean it. The box itself is very heavy when filled with litter. It is difficult for an elderly person, such as myself, to operate this product due the weight. I have solved that problem by placing the box on a table and it is quite managable that way. The actual box is very flimsy. The available space inside the box is very small even though I have the large size. If the manufacturer would improve on this product and make it more sturdy and construct it so that the clips stay in place they would have a really wonderful product. Even with its flaws, I still prefer it over the regular litter box."
4,Could be made better,"I bought this litter box because it looked simple to use. It actually is very simple to use, however, it could be made a bit more sturdy. The sliding clasps do not hold real well. I am using a clamps on it to hold it together when I am rolling it to clean it out. Other than this, I am very happy with the product."
1,"fingers are bleeding, but it still won't clamp together","Carefully read the directions twice and then attempted to put it together.Followed the directions and struggled to get all the clamps to lock. No matter what I do, the final clamp will not lock in place.So one star for great concept. Two bleeding thumbs down for ease of assembly."
5,catscabin,This is perfect for our home with seven cats. It is not expensive and it takes only a few seconds to clean the entire box. Best product I have used in years!
2,"Better than a small box, but with one BIG flaw","The big flaw on this is that it is impossible to use with a litter box liner because the top snaps on with sliding pastic hinges that hook into the bottom portion. (And you have to use the hinges because the whole point of this box is to roll it upside down.) Without a litter liner, you are forced to hand clean any mess left inside once you dump the contents for a full clean (not so easy either).I suppose this box would be ok if you had a back yard and could simply hose it down, but if you live in a big city like I do, four stories up, this just adds a lot more to your work.I recommend Clever Cat top entry litter box instead. It's my other litter box, keeps the litter off the floor, uses a litter liner, and is cheaper."
4,Great product,"I purchased this box about three weeks ago and I love it. I have the large box and it's spacious enough inside for my cat and cleaning the box is a cinch. One little problem I've been having on a regular basis (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) is one of the latches on the right side keeps coming undone and a small amount of litter leaks onto the floor when I bring the box back up. Other than that, it works fantastic. Would buy it again.**UPDATE 10/31/08** The latch I was having problems with was broken. I emailed the company and they promptly mailed me replacement latches (at no additional cost). I replaced the broken latch and all was well however after a few months use, the latch has broken again. A minor flaw from a great design."
5,Best Litter Box!,"This is a terrific litter box.I've had automatic litter boxes. I've had self sifting litter boxes. I've had regular litter boxes. This is the litter box for me and my cats. I've got the large one for my tubby tabby and his 2 pals. I clean the litter box at least every other day. It sits on the bottom landing and is perfect there.There might be a little odor after my little kitty uses the box. She's not real great about covering her poo. But, other that, it's great.When cleaning the box, I pull it toward me and roll it to the right. I empty the pull out tray and then roll the box again. When I have it rolled over, I give the bottom a thump, just to make sure nothing is sticking. I empty the tray again but there is usually nothing in it.I've been using the box for 3 months and there is nothing sticking to the bottom or the sides. They stay clean.Best litter box ever!"
3,Cheap Plastic Material Ruined a Good Design,"AESTHETICS and DESIGNThis a nicely colored (green and beige) and well-thought out litter box design.Deep enough to hold a good 4-5 inches without tracking too much, with clips to hold the top as you turn it on its side to filter the clean litter out and drop the waste into a long container that can be pulled out and emptied.MATERIALUnfortunately the flimsy plastic grate placed in the middle of the box (the source of the scoop-free design) is held by a couple notches, and, after using this a couple months, one or two of the clips holding the top gave, it no longer can be flipped over to empty it 'scoop-free.'SYNOPSISIt's still a nice litter box, and without the, its a decent size for the cats. I still like the hood, and the color, and its better than any box I see in the stores."
2,Disappointed,"I was very excited about this litter box based on the glowing reviews. Unfortunately, all the negative comments about this litter box are correct. Even with rolling slowly and tapping the side, all of the clumps would not make it over. There were clumps that got stuck behind and on the sides of the pullout shelf causing bad odors over time. Clean litter also went into the shelf causing a big mess when emptying it. The latches on the litter box are cheap and non sturdy. It defeats the whole purpose if I have to spend 5 minutes banging on the sides or scooping out the extra clumps that did not roll over. After about 3 weeks (I wanted it to work so badly) I gave up, removed the sifter and just use it as a regular litter box. The product was a great idea, just not executed well."
1,Inaccurate Product Name Is Misleading,"This product, such as it is, may function adequately as an EASY-TO-CLEAN litter box. However, IT IS NOT SELF-CLEANING. A true self-cleaning litter box is one that does just what the name says: CLEANS ITSELF. While all litter boxes needs regular disinfection, there are litter boxes on the market that do the sifting for you -- without any action required on the part of a human. This one does not. There's even (at least) one that washes and disinfects itself. This unit does none of the above by itself. I have no opinion on the merits of the litter box itself. But I do object to the misleading name. Shop carefully!"
5,Best litter box EVER,"I was very unsure how this was going to work when we first ordered this, or if the cats were even going to like it. We have four cats, all different ages. We at one point had four litterboxes, which was a stinking, embarrassing mess. The cats took to this box right away, and it has been a huge blessing. It is as easy as described to use and clean. Like any other litter box, it still needs to be thoroughly cleaned out and have litter levels maintained, but lets face it, rolling a box and emptying the sleeve is alot better than messy scooping. Our cats and our noses are happy!!"
2,Good idea but doesn't work in my house,"We've had this litter box for about 6 months now and it is a good idea in theory but doesn't work for us. Whenever the cat goes #1 near the divider inside the box (which is about 90% of the time) the mess clumps up all around it. So not only does this hamper the roll feature from working correctly, but every week I have to take the thing apart and clean off the divider piece. It is more trouble than it's worth. I ended up just removing the divider and scoop it out like a regular litter box now."
3,Make sure you have plenty of room.,"I live in an apartment and decided to give this a try. It's easy to clean the litter because you just roll it over and the clumps are collected in a removable tray. I only had room in the bathroom to put a litter box, just between the toilet and tub. Because of how packed in it was, rolling the litter box was not that easy. If you have enough room to roll it over easily, this is a great product. But, if you don't have much room then rolling it will be a problem, so you may want to check out other options."
3,Too small,"""Regular"" is misleading, this litter box should be called small. I have to get a larger one for my cat."
5,A Great Litter Box,"This litter box is the best thing that ever happen to owning a cat. I can't believe I scooped litter for nearly 19 years and now my Bengal Kittens have a litter box that is the best thing ever made for a cat. I have only had one problem one of my little latches broke off today and I'm so sad, but it's only been 3 weeks since I got it and Amazon took care of me and they are sending me a new one. It would be good if Omega would make replacement latches for this box, as this could be a problem but a very inexpensive part could even come with a replacement one."
3,Depends upon the cat...,"We have 2 cats, one is quite petite and the other is large. This size is too small for both. It would be fine for my small cat if only she would TURN AROUND after she gets in. Unfortunately she only did this SOMETIMES... the other times her back end was out the door, so puddles and poo were on the floor! I like the concept, the roll-and-clean feature works great, but it is just too small. It takes up a bit of floor space but inside the business area is very cramped. If your cat is small and gets the concept of actually going all the way in, then turning around to face out before doing her business, this might be fine for you. We are trying the large, hopefully that will solve the problem. Otherwise it's back to the electric Littermaid."
4,Easy enough,"I don't love or hate this litter box. It is easy to use once you understand that you don't just tilt it to clean it, but need to roll it on to the lid."
3,It's Okay,"This self-cleaning litter box, was great at first. Unfortunately, putting a little too much litter in the box will break it and it is more of a hassle to turn it every day for cleaning."
1,fine dust gets on the floor.,"fine dust ends up on floor when using this, and no door leaves a constant litter box odor in the air."
2,"tiny opening, not even big enough for my kittens","I was seriously disappointed with this product. The space inside was a LOT smaller than I had expected and the opening was so small, it was difficult for my kittens to get in and out easily. Additionally, the whole ""roll and clean"" thing didn't work very well. All in all, I would not recommend this item to anyone."
3,Seems like it would work great with a different litter,"I am using Tidy Cat Breathe Easy premium clumping litter and it sticks to the bottom of the pan defeating the purpose of the self-cleaning function since I have to manually scoop out the litter. I think that if I try a different clumping litter I may not have the same issue, and then I will be able to use the product as it was intended. But in the meantime it makes a great covered litter box. I guess the overall comment is results may vary depending on what kind of clumping litter you use."
2,Doesn't work well,"Got the smaller one, suits a small-regular cat OK.On the down side: the overall plastic quality could have been better. Lots of clean sand gets to the waste bin. You have to go through the waste bin and return the clean sand to the box. Some sand clamps and gets stuck to the bottom, so it doesn't reach the bin. Some clamps don't reach the bin at all, even if are not stuck to anything. So you will have to clean the sand in a regular fashion anyway.For this price - it is an OK box. Thinking about taking out the inner divider to make it a regular litter box, with more room for the cat."
5,Great litter box,I used to live somewhere with a basement. I then moved into an apartment and I needed to keep the cat's litter box in the kitchen. My cat used it right away. It's big enough for him (he's 18 pounds). Emptying the litter couldn't be easier. The enclosure keeps him from kicking it out. Love it.
2,Good Idea But...,"I received the Omega Paw Self Cleaning Litter Box as a holiday gift from a well meaning friend. It does not work for me. The Omega Paw Self Cleaning Litter Box is quite large and therefore requires a lot of room to roll it back and forth and also weighs more than I had anticipated (14 pounds jug of litter plus a few pounds of the box itself). My biggest problem though is that I have arthritis in my hands and getting the plastic top ""locked"" into place is very difficult and painful. It isn't an easy task for anyone to do. You need to remember that this action is not a one time thing;every time you change the litter you need to take it apart and then reassemble. I have emailed the seller and the manufacturer about returning the product but after 4 weeks I have not had the courtesy of a reply. I wish it were otherwise but I would not recommend this item."
5,Poop in a scoop!,It is gross how much I like cleaning the cat box now. All you have to do is turn it on its side and the scoop fills up with poop. Every time I do the roll over I take the scoop out and show my gf just to brag about how cool this box is.
2,Great concept. Cheaply designed,"I so wanted to give this five stars and, if I'd written the review the first week, this would have five stars. We've had this box three months and I'm now looking for a replacement. The latches broke within a month so the lid falls off easily and the grate does not stay in place. We are going to toss this one. Still, just because I am hopeful that somebody will make a quality rolling litter box, I am giving this two stars."
5,Best Litterbox Ever!,"I was rather sceptical at first about all the wonderful reviews this litterbox received so decided to purchase one myself. This is the best litterbox ever! It took 2 minutes to assemble, no more touching cat's waste, and clean up is a snap. My cats were actually waiting in line to use the litterbox when I first put it together! I ended up buying a total of two of these litterboxes and am thinking of buying another one. I have been using the litterboxes for about a month now and have not found any negatives as of yet."
4,Works pretty good.,I like this cat box. My house doesn't stink all the time anymore thanks to the enclosed box. It is so easy to clean that it gets attention more often too. The only down side is I need to get a scoop for the really small pieces of clumps. The really small clumps do fall through the vent/grate and end up still in the box. It's not really that big a deal so I am still happy with my purchase. If the vent/grate were more like a screen it may catch more of the small clumps.
4,Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box,The large is more of a medium size (to me) but it fits great in my laundry room -- my husband takes it out and sprays it down to clean it. Pretty easy to put back together. My 3 cats seem to like it. I will be adding two more cats so I may purchase another one. Great item for the price.
4,Better Than Scooping Daily,"First of all, I would love to be able to afford a litter box that does everything itself and flushes like a toilet, but the cost is too much for my meager budget, especially since I need two of them! I finally settled on this one and have enjoyed not having to scoop litter daily, but I have 3 kitties and do have to empty it daily. The odor problem has been cut down to be only when it gets too full or I forget to roll it. The problem we have with this box is that the litter gets caught in the grooves sometimes, so that the top doesn't click tightly. When you roll the box, then litter gets out through the corner, when it's not sealed tightly. It is vastly better than scooping, and it's cost effective, so I'm happy with it!"
5,Best Catbox,"I bought this litter box wondering if my cat would go inside and use it and whether it was as easy to use as described or not. It was easy to assemble with the directions - took me like 3 minutes. My cat went right in and used it! It has a large opening and is actually quite spacious. It separates the clumps and litter wonderfully. No more scooping! No more litter all around the box! So convenient! Love, Love, Love this product. I highly recommend it!"
4,Good Product,"I have been very satisfied with this litter box. It is super easy to clean the litter every day with little or no mess. And the best part, you never touch the litter! It has been great for my young daughter to help take care of the cat. My only comments would be that changing the litter is a little tricky, and can be messy, only because of the unique shape of the bottom piece, but once you get the hang of it, it is not a problem. Since there is no liner for this type of litter box (nor can there be), the bottom piece has to be cleaned with every litter change. But that is less often, since you remove the waste every day, keeping the litter fresh. I think this litter box works best with the super-clumping litter. I kind of wish it came in other colors."
3,Great but really needs a door,"As a vast majority of the reviews have stated, this litter box system works very well to extract cat waste easily and minimal litter waste. We have one small cat, but unfortunately she is one of those cats that really flings litter when she covers up. We end up with lots of litter on the floor every time she uses it. This box REALLY needs a door option."
4,"Good product, reasonable price!",I bought this two months ago for my new Ragdolls Kitten. He started using it right when we brought him home. It works great! Although I think the quality can be improved a little (like the lock tabs and the edges of the upper and bottom casing). But I am happy with it so far.
2,Good in theory but not worth the mess!,"When I first received this cat box, I loved it for about 2 weeks. Then I started to notice every time that I would roll the box litter would spill out. The slides that hold the box together slips and spills litter. I would have loved this box if I didn't have to pick up the spilled litter every time I use it."
2,Not so great,"I thought this would make life easier...to have a dipping of the container and collect the clumps, but too much loose litter comes, too...and it is more awkward than just shoveling the clumps out of the cheaper box models.I wouldn't recommend this product. Too extravagant for what it provides."
2,Concept good but does not work for all cats,"I was looking forward to not scooping any more...but this product did not work for me. I have 2 diabetic cats and their urine is very sticky...so the clumps stick to the bottom of the box and do not roll into the container. So, now I have to clean and return it!"
1,LITTER BOX,"IT WAS EASY TO SET UP; HOWEVER, i WAS CONSTANTLY RELOCKING TO PREVENT LITTER FROM SPILLING ALL OVER THE PAPER. SO FAR ONLY ONCE DID THE BOX CATCH THE LITTER. NOW I AM USING AS A TRADITIONAL LITTER BOX (I.E., SCOOPING THE LITTER OUT MANUALLY). IT MAY BE I PUT TOO MUCH LITTER IN THE BOX - ONCE LITTER IS DOWN THEN I WILL RETRY."
1,Only worked for a little while.,This product worked great for 2 or 3 weeks! That was the end of it. The litter started being removed with the clumps and the plastic started to break. I had ordered this early so I would be prepared when bringing home the kitty so now the time has passed and it is not worth the trouble to return it. It is a great concept but just did not work very long. Don't waste your money!
5,"Stop ""digging for buried treasure"" forever!","I have had this litter box for 6 months now and love it. It is so much easier and less disgusting than ""digging for buried treasure"". It definitely takes up more space in general, plus needing space to roll it, but it is worth it!"
1,Too Much Work!!,"I had high hopes for this item. There are three cats in my household and I thought this would be a better way of cleaning up behind them, but unfortunately, it is not. The time it takes to turn the box on its side to shift the loose litter into the holding tray at the bottom in order for the larger clumps to fall into the pull out tray is time consuming and too much effort. It was much easier scooping it out in a regular litter box tray without the hassle. Also, the side clamps are not secure enough to keep litter from oozing out the sides onto the floor for additional clean up. This is not what I expected it would be better to get an automatic litter box cleaner."
5,I love it,"I can't believe I'm so excited about ... a litter box.I admit that I hated changing the litter in the other one. I was never a very good ""daily scooper."" With this box I roll it over about every other day, and it's done. It takes about 1 minute.The only problem is that the box is a little too big for our hall closet, so we have to lift it up in the air and turn it to get it in/out.I was worried that the lid would be a problem for one of the cats (tall cat -- we had to remove the lid from the old box), but it's big enough that he doesn't seem to mind at all.I highly recommend this to busy cat parents."
5,A great litter box!,"I wanted to get a covered box because my cat always kicked her litter all over the floor. This box not only eliminates most of the litter coming out, but it is so easy to clean. A quick roll and roll back, and then I just dump the waste from the drawer into the trash bag.I tried some of the bio-degradable litter with this pan and found it did not work well, the clumps kept getting stuck to the bottom of the pan, and I had to manually remove them. The regular clumping litter works very well, I find a couple of nice taps on the bottom of the pan while I have it rolled over makes any clumps that are stuck fall right off.Note that there is not alot of room for the cat in here, so make sure it is big enough for your cat."
5,Super timesaver!,"This box is the BEST! No more scooping at all- like the others say, it takes just a few secs. to clean it, then I just slide out the tray and dump the clumps down the toilet. Use flushable litter if you choose to do this. My only problem with it is the clips that hold it together-I think I'll take the others' advice and replace them with my own screws. Also, I have one cat who tends to hang her butt out of it when she goes. She did it with every other box I've tried, but she does it a little more often with this one, as the space inside is a little cramped. My other three cats have no problem with it, though. Because it's so quick to clean, I clean it much more often, too, making my cats and my nose very happy! I will still give it five stars, since I think it deserves ten!"
2,"Good idea, bad engineering!","The clips that hold the lid on were really REALLY badly made and I didn't have the strength to press them firmly all the way. So whenever I flipped the box, the lid would come off. Messy and very frustrating and completely defeated the purpose!!"
2,What if YOUR bathroom's ceiling was covered with feces? Would you want to use it?,After reading countless reviews I stumbled upon some recent positive ones and I noticed the price dropped so I decided to give this a try. Despite reading about latches breaking and all sorts of issues I figured I could come up with solutions to prevent them.Overall I have to be honest and say this thing will require more work than just cleaning your litter box by hand. Little chunks will get stuck. You'll have to sift through the chunks it leaves behind. You'll have to take it apart and sanitize it a couple times a month just so it doesn't get icky. The plastic to the little drawer is also flimsy/poor quality and it doesn't fir perfectly or slide in and out with ease.I sent my rolling box of poo back where it came from.
2,Was decent while it lasted.,"My fiancee and I got 2 kittens when we moved into our new apartment. Once they were about 3 months we bought this to try and save some labor. Just roll and empty, right? WRONG!When you roll it, all of the litter goes through the screen like it's supposed to, but when you roll it back it stays on the wrong side of the screener so you have to roll it even more to even attempt to get all of the litter back into the area where the cat goes.It was definitely more of a hassle than getting on my knees and scooping. But it did do what it says, just wasn't as easy and pain free as it looked. Anyways, a month or so went by and the screen broke. WOOOOOOO LITTER EVERYWHERE!I now use it as a regular litter box. Pop off the top and scoop it regularly. :}"
3,Need a lot of floor space for this,"We have a closet with a cat door on it that we keep our litter box in. We need to pull this out of the closet to flip it over, so its not amazing. It really does require a lot of room to flip it. It does do a pretty good job of ""scooping"" the litter but i feel like it hoards a lot of clean litter in the area below the pull-out poop part. We just ended up taking the top off and scooping it with a litter scoop."
4,the best litter box choice,"This is an outstanding, ingenious litter box !After trying the ""automatic self-cleaning"" (good for nothing) and returned litter boxes...I once again decided to try a new litter box. This one is great ! I ordered the largest size for my 2 cats. You simply roll the litter box (and it's not heavy) , then return it to the orginal position and the ""clumps"" are deposited in a nice tray , you simply pull out the tray and dipsose of the waste. There are no parts to wear out, no filters needed, no waste bags needed. It would get a 5 star rating if it had an auto-clean up on the litter the cats leave on the carpet after using the box. I don't know why I don't see these sold in stores."
5,WOW,I heard about this box from a gal I met while out shopping. We have 7 indoor cats and 7 traditional boxes. Needless to say cleaning them daily was a chore...............I ordered two of the large Omega boxes and LOVE them.Cleaning takes only a minute.....I do it twice a day and it takes less time than when I cleaned the others once a day. I plan on getting a couple more.
5,Who knew...,"My family surprised me with this for Christmas. Who knew I would love this product so much! It's totally easy to use -- no more bending over a funky litter box, sorting through the litter to find the remains. Roll over, roll back, roll further back, slide out the tray, add some more litter. And the price is very right."
3,Not quite right,"I love the idea, and it works, but not quite as well as I had hoped. Maybe it's because I use the clumping ""Feline Pine"" which doesn't clump as tightly as others. Small bits of poo and pee get stuck in the slots and to the bottom/sides. Also, I have to shake it like mad to get the clean litter to filter through the slots, then shake it again to get it back into the main compartment. I've only used it for a couple weeks, but it already needs a thorough cleaning. I got the regular size and the usable digging space is very small. I guess it is faster than cleaning a regular litter pan, but not by much."
1,"Great idea, not for every cat.","Great concept, and obviously it works well for many, as all the 5 star reviews attest. I have two 15-20lbs Maine Coons, and one goes in and hangs his rear out the hole, leaving his business on the floor. Back to the Home Depot mud tub for my boys.Still, if you have a smaller, less obstinate cat, this seems like a great idea. The rolling and sifting worked as advertised, when the stuff was inside the box, of course!"
5,Couldn't be better!,"I now have 5 cats (2 new kittens just came home) and I bought this liter box hoping to make the liter changing job easier. It's fantastic! So simple it makes me wonder, ""why didn't someone think of this before?"" Great product, now I will order a second for the rest of the cats."
1,Litter box smells because cat's waste sticks inside,I am very disappointed in this litter box. The cat's waste sticks to the sides and gets caught when trying to sift the litter....This causes a terrible smell even when cleaned everyday.
4,pretty good,"works like advertised. pretty easy to clean, but takes some effort to rotate it all around and back again.have to clean out the insides every couple weeks, or the stuff sticks to the ""top"" when you turn it over and doesn't fall into the bucket. so you reach in and knock it off with the usual tool, but you might touch the stuff too....still, worth buying. glad we have it."
5,Works great,"This is a simple concept that works great. I hated to bend over and sift the litter with the little shovel. Just roll it over, roll it back, then empty the drawer. Easier on the back."
5,Absolultely love it!,"This product is absolutely perfect! I used to get in 'trouble' everyday for not cleaning out the litter box (traditionally with the hand scoop). But now I actually look forward to cleaning it out daily. So easy to use, saves litter, and my cat obviously loves it!"
1,an utter waste of money,"The part where the cat actually is supposed to go in is quite small. My cat is medium sized and he couldn't turn around in there once he'd walked in. Plus the whole concept of 'rolling' didn't come through to me before I bought it, but you just turn the whole thing over on its side basically. I can't see how that would be less work than scooping, even if my cat had wanted to use the thing. To be fair, he walked in it once to pee because for some reason he does that with his butt facing out, but he poos looking out and couldn't even turn around in there! This was supposed to be the larger one too!I'm putting it on craigslist for free, no one will even buy this piece of junk from me."
1,Great idea - but,I bought this based on the high reviews - and the concept. It seems like this is what I needed. It was easy to put together. My kitties took a few days to get used to it - but did use it afer awhile so that was not the issue. It worked well the first few days - but basically stopped working after about a week. The poop and pee-balls didn't go into the tray and stayed in the main litter compartment. The little drawer-tray filled with clean litter intead. So I ended up removing the pieces and using it as a regular litter box. So . . . don't waste your money!
5,Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box,"I had one of these and the handle broke off the litter drawer. When I couldn't find a way to replace the drawer alone, I wanted to purchase another litter box like it, but could no longer find it in the local stores. I was happy to find one at Amazon."
2,"Cheap build quality, doesn't work well","I read many of the positive reviews on this site, but have to say, my experience was very different. The build quality of this litter box is not good; the pullout tray does not fit completely within the frame so when you roll the litter box, you'll often times get litter falling out through the crack. Additionally, the litter box does get quite dirty on the inside and needs to be opened and cleaned periodically which defeats the entire purpose in my mind since it is a bit of a pain to open with the various clips.If you do empty this EVERY DAY it may work ok (but honestly, if you empty a normal litter box every day it is less work than rolling this thing over, etc), but if you would prefer to only have to empty your litter box every few days, this is not the product for you.Colin"
2,Doesn't work as described.,I was so excited about how easy this litter box would be to use/clean. I have two adult cats and have been using this litter box for about 2 weeks now - I'm so disappointed. The tilting action used to 'clean' the box works great with poop. It does not work with pee though. I don't think my cats are abnormal in their 'bathroom' habits. Whenever I go to do the tilt action (about twice a day) I notice that the pee spots stay stuck to the bottom or sides of the box. I end up cleaning it like a regular littler box every time.
5,Great product!!,"This is the best cat litter box I have owned. It really does work and I am very pleased. It has saved me on buying so much litter, and is very easy to clean."
2,Worked for a while....,"I loved this box when I first bought it; it worked beautifully, but now it has ceased to function properly. The collection box fills with CLEAN litter, and perhaps a few clumps. The screen seems to be in the proper position, so I don't know what has happened to make this box stop working, but it sure is a disappointment! Worked for about a month."
5,I Shi_ you not!,Not very often have I bought a product that lived up to the claims of its maker. This one does. It just simply works.Such an easy concept it had to work. No moving parts just roll it over and roll it back and empty the bin. It is really just that simple. I have never been so satisfied with a litter box.
2,"Decent at first, but disappointing down the road","This product was great at first, and worked as advertised. It wasn't quite the miracle machine that it set itself up to be, but it sure beat scooping every other day.Fast forward to 4 months later: despite carefully cleaning the product of the unavoidable stains that come hand in hand with cat waste (in hopes of maintaining the box's overall longevity), the internal plastic separator (the portion that helps you separate solid waste from the litter) eventually wore away the plastic holders inside the litter box itself, disabling the rolling functionality of the product.Fortunately, it doubles as a simple cat litter box if the interal parts break, so all is not lost. Just be warned that the lifespan on my product barely broke 4 months when servicing two kitties."
4,"Great concept, not great quality","I don't think you can find a better litter box for $30. That said, it doesn't have the great constructions. The plastic is somewhat flimsy and the plastic clips that hold it together definitely could have used a redesign.The good news is that it works. It works so well I am even considering buying one for my girlfriend's house even though my cat is only over there about 3 days out of the month. You are paying for a great idea, but the quality could be a little better. I imagine later models of this litter box will only get better, but I definitely recommend this one to anyone who is sick of scooping. The best thing I've noticed about this litter box is the lack of litter odor or dust in the air. I'm living in close quarters with my cat and this litter box definitely hides the odor and gives my cat more privacy.Awesome product!"
5,Perfect!,This litter box works great! I purchased the small one and the large one. My cats love it and I no longer have to look at an open litter box. This system does exactly what it's advertised to do. It makes cleaning the litter box easy.
2,Lock is broken already....,"I was a satisfied customer when I received this product; however after 3 months, I kept on spilling the litter from the box. I checked all the locks and one of them broke already so now, I dread cleaning it...I wish I had known that it's not as durable as I thought :("
2,Can we say clunky?,"Don't let the product name fool you. I found this box to be anything but self-cleaning! The inner grate misses pieces and I was constantly scraping clumps from the sides. Also, it is clunky,so it won't fit in small spaces and need a lot of room to roll it for the ""self cleaning"" process, which shakes a lot of litter dust into the room and causes the collector tray to spill small amounts of litter onto the floor through a crack along the outer edge. No matter how far in I pushed the tray, I could not fully close the gap. It is also heavy so people with bad backs,the elderly and smaller children will find it impossible to use. I bought the larger box which is suppose to be for larger or multiple cats but the inside is still so small, if not cleaned constantly,the cat is stepping in their waste. I have since upgraded to a cat genie which I am very happy with. Bottom line, I regret ever wasting money in this piece of junk."
1,Bad cat titter box.,Cat didn't like the box. Used it for just a short time. Got rid of the box and the cat. The new owner got rid of the box.
3,Works for only small clumps..,"Great idea! However, only for certain sized clumps.My cat happens to drink a lot and pee a lot so the clumps are big and unfortunately don't fit thru the collection bin.So we are still scooping. Check the size of the clumps for your existing litter. I think this product works the best if the clump is slightly smaller than your fist."
5,Great Concept,"This is a great concept and works flawlessly for us. At first one of our two cats did not seem to like the litter (recommended ""World's Best""). We added some of the litter previously used (Scoop Away) and that improved the acceptance.The unit seems to work just fine with the different litter even though the clumps are larger than with the recommended brand. We keep a small brush and dust pan on top of unit and after rotating the unit we sweep up the litter on the floor that the cats leave with their feet and dump it in the tray before taking out to a sack in the garage. Takes about 2 minutes and your done. We've been using for over two weeks and it's still clean inside, no problems."
2,Great idea but very poorly made product.,"I purchased this litter box approximately six months ago. I have two cats.This litter box initially worked out really well for me. There was always one issue with it and that was clumps of cat litter getting into the back of the grate on the inside of the box. (This is what sifts the clean litter and dirty litter, but it was no big deal because the grate snaps off and you clean the box out.So fast forward a few months later and the piece of plastic that keeps that grate in place brakes. I sort of manage to fix it or at least use the litter box in a way that was functional. Then one of the clips that held the top on broke and every time i flipped it over litter came pouring out.If this litter box was made better it would be great but unless you are interested in replacing it every few months, I would say don't buy it."
5,Love this litter box!,Such a great product! Easy to assemble and easy to use! No more arguing about whose turn it is to clean the litter box. Our cats love them too. 2 of our cats are big boys (13-15lbs) and they both have plenty of room to turn around inside the litter boxes. I highly recommend this product!
3,omega paw,this litter box doesn't work exactly like i'd hoped it would. for some reason i am finding that when i roll it the litter itself goes into the little tray but the waste stays in the main part. other than that it's okay.
4,Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box,"I am a bit disappointed in the quality but like the convenience. Two things bother me--the clips will not stay closed, resulting in a mess to clean up when the top loosens up while tipped and most of the time the cat urine sticks to the bottom so I end up having to use the scoop to loosen the clump.Even so, the self cleaning is much better than the normal litter box."
3,"Ok, but...","I love the concept and function of this cat box, however I do recommend it for ""large"" cats. My cat is 15 lbs, certainly not as large as cats can get, and he has just about fits inside the large size box. The cat can only actually use 1/2 of this box, because there's a divider/grate inside and the right side is where the litter sifts to when you roll it over. When he climbs in, there's no room for him to turn around so he pees up against the front wall. He's now begun to poop outside the box, unfortunately. Maybe small/petite cats would have an easier time using this box. Unfortunately, I'm going to go back to the traditional open box and freecycle this one to someone who might have better luck with it than I have."
5,Great Litter Box,"Ordered a second Omega for the two cats we just adopted. It is quick and easy to do the litter and the cats are great about the box. Have to get good litter, some doesn't work as well. We get the Dr. Elsey brand...seems to be the best with this box."
5,Omega Paw Litter Box,"With two cats, it is always best to be prepared and this product makes it simple. I have tried a self cleaning litter box that never performed as well as advertised. I also used the usual litter tray that I hand scooped every day and although that was easy enough, nothing beats the ease of use that this litter box offers. Simply tilt the box to the right and the litter sifts into the mesh area leaving the clumps with all the ""business"" to fall into the long receptacle. Grasp the protruding handle and slide the receptacle full of dirty litter out and empty it into a trash bag. Slide the receptacle back in, tilt the litter box to the left to allow the clean litter to sift back into the box and you're done. ""No fuss, no muss."" It all takes about 15-20 seconds and everything remains clean both in appearance and reality."
4,Self Cleaning Litter Box,The litter box does help to save room. It does make daily cleaning easy. The only complaint I have is that sometimes it does become difficult to move the latches to lock or unlock the box. Otherwise a good product to have.
