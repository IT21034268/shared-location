1,Dire!,"'Jon Bon' must have caved into the accountants or something on this very, very, ordinary offering. The accountants said' 'lets do all your old songs with a bunch of acoustic guitars and see if we can sell it to all those Bon Jovi fans (read suckers) and make a bunch of money.'Did they actually watch this after they filmed it?The band looks like they are about to fall asleep near the end and I nearly did too!Come on Jon, if you want to do an acoustic album, do it, but with some new material. These songs just don't work in an acoustic setting...why didn't you plug-in?Dire, dire, dire....."
2,Same songs different sounding,"Don't expect to hear the same rocking classics that they wrote in the 80's. They have taken all of the classic rocking songs, slowed them down and play the melodies differently. The DVD is good but not what I wanted. Sorry."
3,Meh,"Some interesting facts, but way too long for the content provided. Nice background info on the French and Indian War."
2,"Overpriced, Overhyped. Bad for Flash Cameras. Wheel broke after 3 months.","We bought this stroller and the left back wheel started to wobble after 3months.I can't believe noone mentioned this here, but the reflectors on the front will ruin all your flash pictures!! Really really awful design to put that there.120$ is too much for this stroller. I expect it to be more durable."
4,Love this stroller.,Very smooth ride and extra wide for my 2 year old. Will be great for many years to come. It is very sturdy and goes on any terrain. My only complaint is that it tips when too much is put on the back and there is no cup holder. It is though the best stroller I have bought for my children.
4,Just got it and we're loving it,"The thing that strikes me most about this stroller is its maneuverability. You can really control where you're headed better than most of the strollers we've used. The downside is that since its so compact, you can't really store as much as you're used to. Also, I learned the hard way (actually my boy did) that you can't hang stuff on the handles and expect the stroller to remain upright.All that said, its really a quality product that earns my hearty recomendation."
3,cant let this go on,"listen sublime rules and i love then half to death. but this isnt a 5 star album. this cd is pretty boring in fact and you dont have to get this album is your a sublime fanatic. some decent songs but, blaaa, not even close to as good as sublime. i wish i hadnt bought it."
3,good but not as good,i like this cd but its good not great if u wanna stick with the regular sublime stuff dont buy it but it is a good cd it sounds more regga than punk but its still good!
3,"EX-SUBLIME, NOT BLENDING SO MUCH GENRES...","It's a reggae album. reggae. That's it. It's like listening to ""get ready"" of sublime for an hour. It has good features, but RAS 1 (frontman, guitar and vocals) is trying too hard to fill up bradley's place. if you go to a LBDA show, ou'll know what i'm talking about. He's too similar... well, trying to be. Opie Ortiz (artwork and tatooer) only sings in a few songs. RAS_1 (Who was recluted from another reggae new school band) tries to take all the credits... Good effort, but not as complex and natural like sublime."
4,Let the good vibes play,"This is one of the most versatile for all situations i.e. partying, chilling, or gettin crunked up. The bass lines are so sick (Eric Wilson is God Of Thunder) that it makes some Sublime songs look pale in comparsion. ""Righteous Dub"" has a bassline that makes me want to worship him. Bud keeps it steady with beats and puts on a crazy show of percussion. Ras and Opie can use their pipes (they're no Bradley [RIP] but who is?) and the guest apperances are off the hook. My only problem is this cd is too reggae and not the motley mix of punk/ska/rock/reggae/rap that Sublime made. They need to add more punk/ska but other than that it's awesome. I don't like their version of ""Saw Red"" but ""Kick Down"", ""My Own Life"", and ""Sensi"" are sweet."
2,"I'm sorry, this is no good.","I bought Wonders of the World a few days ago and figured this would be about the same and I am severely disappointed. It has no ""it"" factor. It's pretty much all the same sound, or it's just not bringing me in. Wonders of the World had a few good tracks. I really couldn't find much I liked on this CD. Maybe My Own Life, but that's it. Sorry, but it's just not there. Wonders of the World is ten times better and that's only about a 3 star CD."
5,Great for first-time moms-to-be,"This book is very easy to read. I really enjoyed the lists and the factoids in the margin, as an aside to the content. As a first-time mom-to-be, the book helped explain what is going on in my body, and even helped with why and what I could do about it. It helped calm a lot of my fears, especially since I have not been to the doctor yet and we have not told any friends or family. I highly recommend it!"
4,Good book,So far this book has informed me on stuff I did'nt know. I had no idea Charles Schultz played baseball. This is a very good book.
3,Too good to be true,"I really liked this pan. I liked the color, lightness, and size. Unfortunately, its charms were fleeting. The outside enamel stains easily, so the lovely red was soon marred by brown and black streaks that I couldn't seem to scrub off. Worse, after I had the pan for about a year and a half, only using it once every week or two, the Teflon coating started to flake off. Not in big pieces or anything, but flaking off nonetheless. Yes, the pan was cheap -- only $10 -- but I was hoping to get better quality from T-Fal. Guess I learned my lesson."
2,Chapt 27,"If you want to see a movie about the JOhn Lennon killing, get Chapter 27 with Jared Leto. It's much better. I have both this one and Chapter 27."
5,Beauty,"The author is always a good read, makes you think. Sorry about his early passing. He expands well the Celtic history and poems."
4,Broadcast power will change the world,Book nbr2Jack is asked by Dr Alicia Clayton to recover stolen Xmaspresents from her Pedi Aids Clinic. Gia is a rocker andhugger at the clinic. (God Bless Gia & Dr. C)Alicia realizes that Jack can also help her with a problemhouse and brother. All of a sudden he is surrounded bybad guys (Arabs & Japanese).Alicia has a horrible past and the house is part of it. Shewants Jack to burn it down. This house is hiding a secret.The secret of BROADCAST POWER. What ever B Poweris..it can change the world.All HELL breaks loose. You must read this book and findout what Jack does.
1,would rather have my nails pulled than be forced to watch this again,"I thought, um... Dr.Seuss, Henson puppets, sounds like a great combination. I was wrong! The puppets are fine, cute and cuddly but the CG animation looks like a high school student did it on the weekend and the stories are just boring and mind numbing. It would have better to just stick to the original Seuss stories with the puppets and real sets, but between the CG and the stories I found it painful to even make it through the whole DVD."
2,Where have all the great narative historians gone?,"This uneven account misses the textures to be found in Bruce Catton's 2 volume biography, regretably now out of print. Although Catton's account at times borders on hagiography, his prose vividly recreates the time and Grant's life is lent a richer context than the feeble broth doled out by Simpson. I found it amusing that Simpson's introduction fails to pay homage to Catton's effort and even suggests that Catton half-heartedly wrapped up a project begun by another historian."
1,Dangerous for little ones,"My twin sons were so excited to get this toy, given their enthusiasm for pirates. However, the fun turned to tears quickly when they tried to push the car into the pirates skull and it snapped closed like a mouse trap on their fingers.I tried it, and it even hurt my hand. Keep away from kids younger than five or six, or don't buy at all."
1,I agree to the finger trap!,"I agree to the finger trap, it even hurts an adults finger, my husband and I have had this toy it snapped at both our fingers, I am taking this toy back to the store tomorrow.."
5,Excellent introduction to fiber bundles,"This book supplies a lot of intuition and background that more modern texts seem to assume of the reader. Steenrod's writing is meticulous and extremely clear. My opinion is that one can learn just as much out of this seemingly outdated text and probably even more than from the modern texts.... True, more slick machinery has been developed since Steenrod's time, but those big machines are hardly transparent. Steenrod assumes very little of the reader; he even has a quick course in homotopy groups, although he assumes the reader knows the basics of homology/cohomology. Perhaps most importantly, since many of the ideas in the book were new at the time, he doesn't assume that the reader is already comfortable with those ideas. All together this makes a very accessible book indeed."
1,Bad Orb all right,"The Orb have certainly slid since the heights of Plateau and Valley. If you're into monotonous electronic drum rhythms you might get something out of this. Otherwise, give it a miss. Unimaginative and boring. Great disappointment."
5,Bible Story Coloring Pages,"I appreciate the clean, clear drawings presented in this book of coloring pages. The large number of individual stories included helps me to help my children comprehend the way of life in Bible times and they are good discussion starters. The story with Bible reference on the reverse side of the drawing enables my children to read some of the story themselves for increased understanding."
5,Love my Felcos bought these for my husband,"About 4 years ago, I bought the small Felco pruners (I think they're the #6)and I'm very pleased with them. They've outlasted all of the other pruners I've owned. Four years without being sharpened and they're still cutting well. I expect the same from these."
3,It could have been better,This book was too predictable and the female character was smart but her actions were stupid. From the beginning of this book I knew how everything was going to end and I'm not one of those people who can figure out what's going to happen easily either. Read the book if you must but like me you might be disappointed.
4,It's a Pre-Raphaelite book,"The text is interesting, and there are some odd as well as very recognizable images. Not too bad."
5,Happy Grandson!,These larger strips held the Wall Tracks up very well!!! The ones that came with the tracks weren't strong enough.
2,"Good, not great","The plot was interesting but I couldn't follow the 'Godess' part of the novel, it was strange and silly. I can't honestly recomend it. Also it is hyped up as being very sexual and it isn't. Not really."
4,Standard And Gets The Job Done!,"If you are not expecting much, this is perfect for small plate weights (5-25lb weights). I just needed something for my small plate weights, and I got a better quality tree for my larger plate weights. It's okay for the price, but don't expect too much from this product and don't use this tree for any other use other than home use."
3,"Good book, but pages fall off !!!","Obviously I haven't read the 1200 pages yet, but my two day review revealed the fact that this book could be quite resourceful. However, during my review, some of the pages started to fall off...? After some careful examination, I noticed that the book was put togather in a flimsy fashion; minimum glue and no other support. Well, that was the end for buying Hungry Minds books who are the publishers. Cheating on dismal amount of glue necessary for a book makes consumers like me very unhappy, especially if it's a technical book and you do a lot of ""page referencing"".I'll keep the book. But say bye-bye to Hungry Minds (Hungry Pockets?)"
5,Heart lifting movie!,"This is an old, short movie but very uplifting!It makes you smile & laugh!We thoroughly enjoyed it! Even our 4 & 5 year old grandkids enjoyed it.It has a great message in it!"
5,heatshield,I absolutely love this product. Never thought I would find such a perfect fit for such a large windshield. Made of good quality material. I especially like the fact that once rolled up when not in use it has a velcro strap attached to it to keep it rolled up for easy storage. A friend from work has asked for information on how to purchase one for his truck. GREAT BUY!
1,Don't do it!,"This so-called ""movie"" is actually six short stories competing to be dumb, dumber and dumbest. The actors and actresses seem to have been recruited from a nearby homeless shellter. Don't miss the chance to pass on this one!"
1,Listen to the samples before you buy,"The back of the CD has the original artist's name after each song, but these are definitely not the original recordings, and I don't like any as well as the originals."
5,Deserves Listening To!,"This is one of three cds completed by this duet.......duet not really descriptive enough of the very contemporary sounds that result. Eddie Monteiro plays a MIDI Controller Cavichord accordian that provides a wide variety of sounds (not your ""Lady Of Spain"" type of thing!). Coupled with the very appealing vocals of Nancy Marano with backing vocals of Eddie, the results are astounding! The duo also does some relaxed but superb scatting as well.Jobim, Alan and Marilyn Bergman, and Johnny Mandel compositions are included as well as several standards such as ""Autumn Nocturne"", ""Skylark"", ""That's All"" and ""A Sleepin' Bee"". Flugelhornist Claudio Roditi appears on ""Love Dance"" while pianist Roger Kellaway and baritone saxist Gerry Mulligan are heard on individual tracks of their own compositions.This is really a very appealing album that will become a favorite within your collection."
3,"Very quiet, but not a ton of cooling","The noise level of all three fans is excellent, I can barely hear them. However, I had thought I could replace one larger fan with these three, but in reality, all three on my DVR don't keep it as cool as the larger fan."
3,Decent Pan,"This certainly is a decent pan for the price and is nice looking. The handle is a little loose (not bad) so I tried to tighten up the screw that holds it on - but wasn't able to get it tighter. But, for the price it is still a good deal."
4,These girls are Punk Stars,"This is a good album with lots od great guitar. Although depth of lyrics are lacking the music itself really rocks. Plus, there are very few girl punk bands of any infamy. The opening track ""Skin Tight"" is pretty cool. My favorite track is ""Too Fast For Love"". The other mentionable track is ""Get Oatta My Room"" with all its teenage isolation and angst. The words stay mainly to the surrface but the music goes strait to the soul."
5,THE DONNA'S RULE!!!,"Finally an all girl band that rocks as hard as ""The Runaways"", ""We've got a Fuzzbox and we're gonna use it"" or the early ""Go-Go's"". I loved the first two Donna records but this, their third release, is by far the best! Jeff and Steve MacDonald of the very underated band ""Red Kross"" produced this one and it's a match made in heaven. The songs are crisp tight and rocking and ""Hyperactive"" has hit single written all over it. Be the first on your block to discover them.....before they get huge."
5,a really good Donnas cd,"This was the 2nd Donnas album I got after Spend the Night. When I bought it, it immediately became one of my favorite CDs ever. There are so many girl bands out there but some just really.. well, suck. The Donnas are definately not one of them. They have musical talent and the guitarist Donna R. is actually really good! This is the first album the Donnas wrote all by themselves except for the the song ""Too Fast For Love"" which is a Motley Crue cover. I love this song and the Donnas did a great job with it. Good rock album with great lyrics most teen girls would probably like. So go buy it"
3,Pretty Good,"Just heard a sample of one of their songs from this album. They sound like a harder version of The band ""The Runaways"". No offense to all the females who are going to read this, but I have never been a fan of most female performers in rock, but this album seems pretty cool. If your a fan of the band ""The Runaways"", or just a hard rock fan in general, I would suggest this album, as it seems to live up to it's expectations."
5,Excellent Collection,"This is a great mix of seven Disney classic cartoons.I remember watching all of these on TV at one point or another,but not for a number of years now.My 26 month old granddaughter also enjoys these and has asked to watch them several times.I bought this at Target for $9.99 which is a decent price.Perfect for family holiday viewing.If you like the older cartoons,you won't be disappointed."
2,ok,"I was really excited to buy my son a bunch of Disney's Christmas movies, but I gotta say it's not like what i remembered. I wish I knew exactly which ones I wanted. This one was good, but I wanted more sing a longs for him."
5,Ben Gate at it's best!,"This is one Cd that doesn't grow old. Probably the most popular song on this CD is ""Lift Me Up"". This song is a very up-beat song! The lyrics are great in this song! The whole CD is truly one of my favorite CD's that I own. It is a very up-beat CD that you will always enjoy listening to! Oh, also, if you put the CD into your computer, you can see the music video for ""All Over Me"", you can see exclusive pictures that you could only see on this CD!"
4,Worth listening to,"I own both ""Untitled"" and ""Contact,"" and must say that ""Contact"" breaks into a little different territory than the first album. While I really miss the more raw, less ""pop"" sound of the first album, ""Contact"" is offers an upbeat, energetic sound, unique lyrics. Adrienne's soaring and powerful voice rises strongly above the music, making this a very uplifting and enjoyable album.One thing about this second album that differs from the first is that The Benjamin Gate's lyrics tend not to be as blatantly Christian as the first.Also, as another reviewer noted, there is not as much distinction between tracks on this album. The beat is similar on many of the songs.Still, this is a very worthwhile album, one of my favorites. My favorite tracks include, ""This Is Not,"" for its energetic sound, ""Do What You Say,"" for its powerful sound and lyrics, ""Your Kisses Blind Me"" because of its intimant lyrics, and ""Gratitude."""
4,All Business,"I used to wear nothing but Bally's, even though the leather soles would send me skating on barely damp terrazzo. These are true road warrior shoes, comfortable right off the bat, very comparable to J&M's, which need a break-in. One star off for having plastic-looking leather. What's with that Mephisto?"
5,This Artist is on fire,"Not really a Big Reggae fan, but I was always a Shinehead fan from when we was hanging on the chain gang, and pointing fingers at politians. so my wife and I ordered the praises album, and must say that Shinehead never FELL OFF, he was taking time out to produce a classic album.Peter Gatwick"
3,fair,"Good to practice hystory taking and to try to think what's more important to ask. Good, but you need more than this for the exam."
4,Sara's Secrets for Weeknight Meals,"Love her shows, decided to get book instead of going to website for recipes. The Quick Asparagus Lasagna, page 126 and Eggs baked in Ham with sofrito page 104 are family favorites. She makes it all simple and yummy.Sara's Secrets for Weeknight Meals"
1,Useless,"I own many preparation things on the MCAT and this has got to be the worst. I've noticed many mistakes in pronunciation. I reommend ""Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) - Core Content"" by David M. Tarlow"
3,Pleased AND Disappointed,"First of all, I ordered this set on 12/1/06 and it was delivered to me on 12/6/06 ... very satisified with the quick service. However, I noticed that in that period, the Price dropped by $5 ... my loss for not being patient. (This was purchased for our home use, and Not a gift... so there was no rush.)While shopping for a Block Set, I narrowed my search to a Farberware Set, a Henckles Set, and this Pinzon Set. What I failed to notice before my purchase, was that this Pinzon Set comes with NO WARRANTY !!! Most others come with limited LIFETIME Warranties. That IS an important consideration. I would reccomend all to bypass all Pinzon Block Sets for this reason alone.Although I have yet to actually use these knives, they do seem sturdy and weighted properly. I hope they will function as good as the Set looks.Pay attention Warranties before making your purchases."
3,"Good, but could be better.","These knives are very heavy and sturdy for the price. As mentioned in another review, there is a cleaver included that is very heavy and nicely made. They are packaged to survive a drop from an airplane, it seems. The knives all had plastic tips on them to protect them (and you, during the unpacking process) which I thought was a nice touch. That said, the packaging is plain generic cardboard and not very attractive, so if it is a gift for a shallow person....they might not like it. :-) Also, the workmanship is a bit rough on the handles, and the prominent ""CHINA"" on the blades is a bit off-putting. My set is not as sharp as I would like either, this seems to be hit-or-miss according to the other reviews. I wish there was a 3.5 star rating. For the price I paid during a Friday Sale, it was a good value but I think I would have been disappointed at the regular amazon price."
5,An Eclectic EP worthy of a long look,"Listening through this CD the first time I was impressed by it's diversity in keeping with it's hip and groovy vibe. Whether it's tracks from Hip-Hop Prophet KRS-1, Jazz giant Branford Marsalis, or newcomers like The Congregation this CD moves you from start to finish. I especially liked the ""home"" spun sound of Home from Kevin Sandbloom/Brian Rife/Steve Welch/Rich Owens (interesting band name?) This CD is good for a party or a long drive up the coast with the top down. Highly recommended!"
3,Not what you'd expect....,"...which shouldn't be surprising coming from the frontman of a band that consistently defies expectation. And yet it is surprising in the worst way possible--instead of an initial interest and exhilaration, the first time listening to Panda Bear's solo effort is...well...underwhelming. Yet, true to form, the music of this unique talent grows on you, expands inside of you, and eventually wins your respect if, of course, you can stomach a steep (and lengthy) learning curve.Sung Tongs and Feels are throbbing mashes of pure musical joy...Young Prayer is a whisper in comparison. If Animal Collective is like musically making love, Young Prayer is the afterglow."
5,Best Evidence Book I've found,I have read and used several books on evidence in the last eight years and have found none that are as good as this one. Its the best book to use in and out of the courtroom.
5,Definitely an eye opener!,"I believe that ""Clean Slate"" is definitely a great read. It helped me to understand the struggles a sikh in today's society has to face on a daily basis. The strength and faith that the character displayed in the book should be something everyone could apply to in their own lives. After 911, many sikhs were misconstrued with the muslims. This book gives a better understanding of the sikh faith!! The ending of the book was most empowering."
4,Can't put the book down,"I felt that this book gave me great insight on the struggles a young sikh boy has to go through in life. At some points it was emotionally diffcult to read about the physical and mental pain a young boy has to suffer because he does not fit the ""norm"". This book touched my heart and I'm sure it will touch others as well."
4,Good for self-study,This book may be good for those who want to learn Analysis but without a good teacher. It contains many solved problems to show you how the reasoning is like. But nothing else impressive.
1,Poses as constitutional scholarship,"If you want to read actual scholarship pertaining to the second amendment, look to Laurence Tribe, Andrew McClurg, David Kopel, Brannon Denning or Sanford Levinson. Going back a ways, try Justice Joseph Story's Commentaries on the Constitution. Henigan's work is, sad to say, sloppy, ill-reasoned and unapologetically partisan. For scholarship, look to the great jurists - not to a committed lobbyist. Henigan might just as well have summed up his arguments as ""Because that's what I believe: QED."" As his apparent purpose is to ignore the law on this subject, it could have been achieved much more economically by not writing a book at all."
1,WHY DUPLICATE EPISODES?????,"Doesn't anybody have the other Fan Collectives? And doesn't it bother them that the episode ""Trials and Tribble-ations"" on this Klingon Collective is ALSO on the Time Travel Collective. Other, better Klingon episodes could have replaced this one!"
2,I Allowed Paramount to Screw Me,"1) Some relatively lame Klingon episodes are included in this set. ""Barge of the Dead""? Why would anyone include that mediocre episode in a ""best of"" box set? Given that DS9 was full of exciting, complicated episodes that centered on Klingon characters, why were there only two episodes from that series in the entire collection?2) I was charged for a 4 disc set, when they could have easily fit all those episodes on 3 discs. Moreover, given that more episodes could have been included on each of the discs, why weren't they? Doubtless Paramount wants to make certain that I keep buying seasons of DS9."
5,Don Williams Melodies,I have been looking for one song on this album for over 20 years. I am very happy to discover it on this album. Of course all of his songs are great. Love the album.
5,Top Speed !,"If you think there is no connection between the ordinary fruit fly and a modern jet aircraft- Think again. Both these fly ! May be at different speeds- Here is an author who uses the remarakable example of the study of the fruit fly to derive powerful lessons for Business. His concepts on out-sourcing, Supply chain value analysis, volatality amplification and ""clock speed"" read like ""The Ten Commandments"" for Business.Powerful ideas explained well with simple examples. Long live the fruit fly !"
3,"Still a good snack, but were better before","The first time I ordered these the bars came in packs of 20, the price was a bit cheaper, and the bars were dense, sweet, and healthy (four star). Now, the second time I ordered them, they come in packs of 15 for about the same price, and the bars seem to be a bit less dense (now, three star). Still taste pretty good. Still a healthy snack in a pinch, something you won't feel bad about, but they're getting much more expensive very fast, and the formula seems to change a bit from batch to batch..."
1,Disappointing,"I am afraid that I found this book utterly disappointing. Expecting people to have realised that old-fashioned fox-hunting is as much a tradition as gladiator fighting or slavery used to be, I was shocked to see that someone still seems to find it enjoyable. The fact is that countless scientific studies show that fox-hunting is not necessary, and as to all other arguments, what is wrong with drag-hunting? The only answer is that blood-thirsty hunters would not find it as much fun."
3,fight scene rip off,"No complaints here, save for the fight scene with the martial arts hitman...I'd say about 90% of the action footage is directly taken from Jackie Chan's ""Legend Of Drunken Master""."
3,Very Entertaining!,"Okay, maybe this isn't a big budget action thriller, but it is definitely an action thriller. Trech and the rest of the cast don't let you down in this sexy, funny, action packed film. I rented it, but I'm gonna have to buy this soon."
3,Assembly Required?,"I am considering a purchase, seems like a fascinating topic however, I'm not very handy. For anyone who has purchased this does the fly come already assembled?"
1,horrible,"Couldn't finish it. Just awful in so many ways. The story makes no sense, the dialog is beyond wooden. And could Ed please stop casting himself or take acting and voice lessons?A painful film."
2,Expected More,"Loving Ed Burns movies the way that I do I expected more from this movie and I was greatly dissappointed. I loved ""Looking For Kitty"" and about the only thing that this movie has in common with that one is the music (which is very, very good). Everything else is rather boring and Debra Messing looked like a thoroughbred that was being tethered to a bad script. There was hardly any room for her great comedic timing and Selma Blair was like watching paint dry. So wrong for the part. I couldnt believe that she read a book let alone could possibly write one. Patrick Wilson was also not served well by the script and Donal Logue did the best he could with a minimal part. Loved the British accent and was quite surpised at how well he executed it given that he always plays burly, ""New Yawk"" city toughs. All in all, for me, it's an okay movie to catch on cable (like I did) but I wouldn't really advise buying it unless you absolutely just have to have another Ed Burns film."
3,Loose Collars can be Annoying,"Overall this is a good buy. The only issue I continue to have (not necessarily a deal breaker, but a little annoying) is that the collars that hold the Olympic weights constantly come loose. Not to the point where they fall off but to the point where I have to constantly tighten them. Also, if you purchase, I would recommend wearing gloves during use as the diamond pattern on the bar can irritate the skin."
3,Digital Binoculars,"Great to take pictures with sun light, video have not audio, good quality for Both Pictures and Video, good price"
2,Not very clear,The photos aren't very good. And they don't look like what you are looking at. We sent it back after a couple of days. You had to be VERY still to get unblurred pics.
4,Excellent,"I was disappointed only by the fact that Season 2 is not yet available streaming. It is no ""Lost"" but quite good."
1,Choppy Time sequencing and predictable,"I was unable to get through the PILOT episode because the sequence not only jumps point of view every few minutes, but it jumps time. I detest episodes that show you something and then say, ""10 days earlier"" and bring you back to where you were. But this! Oh, please! It kept jumping the timeline back and forth, at least 5 or 6 times before I gave up. And predictable. And not good writing. And the same scene over and over from different points of view. How disappointing!"
3,(UN) EVENT(FUL),Almost a 24hr series format. A lot of soul searching dialog in each episode. Casting not good for some of the lead characters. Special affects were okay but sparse.
4,good show,"Good show, really keeps you going, come on season 2! Wasn't sure I'd like it, but definitely worth the time"
4,Where are the remaining episodes,Not sure why this show was taken off the air. I hope some network will pick it back up in the future. Thanks.
3,Ok but somewhat predictable.,"Typical to serial TV shows, other than the first episode , it takes a whole season to have something significant happen. I watched the first season and became bored with the pace of story development. It is a good premise, but like a soap opera, it takes too long to get to the point."
4,Good brainless fun,Is a perfect series to kill some time with. I look forward to the next season. Not great but better than I see on regular TV
1,"Slow, Slow, Slow","TV Series that are mostly predictable & dull conversations are the worst, and I think this show is a huge offender. I found myself wanting to skip through conversation after conversation. If your show is going to be so heavy on the conversation, it behooves the writers to produce an interesting & original line of discourse. This show is a rehash of a rehash of a rehash, and then rehashed. Do not watch."
2,Disappointing return with some unintended laugh lines,"Having gotten hooked on this show last fall and waited months for it to return, I find the two new episodes disappointing. They show is beginning to move at a standard Hollywood-TV (i.e., glacial) pace and to utter standard Hollywood liberal cliches. At least for a conservative viewer, some of the lines are howlers. In this episode, our black, Obama-like (but better looking and more forceful) President lectures a new Senator who has become suspicious about the Inostranka facility (where aliens are secretly detained) on the sorry state of affairs in her home state of Alaska: ""You have the highest unemployment rate in the country! And the highest rate of childhood obesity!"" Maybe they're planning a nutritionally instructive cameo by Michelle."
5,Edge of my seat,"This show had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I wasn't expecting it to be so good, but it was just what I was looking for. It is really sad that it got cancelled. The twisting intertwining plot lines are part of what make it a great show with great writing, but I guess the majority of people prefer simpler shows."
2,Too predictable and shallow.,The show is too predictable. The characters are very shallow. No wonder there is no second season. It's a pity because the idea had some potential.
5,About Werewolf Skin Goosebumps #60 by R.L. Stine,"ALEX HUNTER IS A PHOTOGRAPHY FREAK. HE LOVES TO TAKE PHOTOS OF EVERYTHING!THEN BEST OF ALL,HE TAKES A TRIP TO VISIT HIS AUNT MARTA AND UNCLE COLIN IN A TOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF A FOREST CALLED WOLF CREEK.HIS UNCLE AND AUNT ARE COOL,BUT WIERD.THEY ALWAYS WARN ALEX TO STAY AWAY FROM THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR,WICH IS CREEPY,RUNDOWN AND ABANDONED,AND TO NOT GO INTO THE FOREST AT NIGHT.OF COURSE ALEX DOSNT LISTEN.LITTLE DOES HE REALIZE HE IS ABOUT TO FIND OUT THE SECRET OF WOLF CREEK.A SECRET HE WISH HE HADNT KNOWN OF.LATE ONE NIGHT, WHEN THE MOON IS FULL...IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT MORE...READ IT...IF YOU DARE...MY EYES DIDNT TAKE A BLINK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOOK...ANYWAYS, WHAT ALEX GETS IS MORE THAN HE BARGAINED FOR..."
4,Love it.,"I really like this tea! I love the combination of apple and cinnimon, and that the cinnimon is not extremely strong. The nutritional facts are a definite plus, by the way, and the ease to find this locally if I am too impatient to wait for an online order is an added pleasure."
2,Maybe it's just me,"I bought this tea on a whim thinking it would be perfect for this autumn and winter. When I opened the box, the smell was fantastic. I had such high hopes for this tea, but was sorely disappointed. It was much too sweet for me. I was expecting something that was heavily spiced, but it seems like the apple flavor is more prominent.I didn't want it to go to waste, so I experimented, trying different things in hopes that my taste buds would be satisfied. I tried steeping it for a short period of time, making iced tea, adding a splash of milk, adding more cinnamon, etc. Nothing seemed to do it for me. I really wanted to like this tea, because it smells so great, but I guess I'll be on the look-out for something else."
1,I didn't enjoy this tea.,"They really need to go back to the drawing board on this one. I thought it would be a lot like a sweet apple cider flavor, with cinnamon in it. To me it tasted like someone put a ton of cinnamon on apple peelings. Tried hard to like it, but couldn't. ICK!"
4,Very Entertaining....,"The first copy that I got did not play episodes 2, 3, 4, & 6. The replacement copy had no problems playing those episodes."
1,dissapointment season where ideas ran out,"I am a big fan of the pretender series and I just wanted to share my disappointment's on season 4 where it's an ending of a comedy season and not a fun season that we've seen in first 3 seasons. I believe they ran out of ideas and they just wanted to fill in the blanks and put any crap. I was really disappointed. :( I recommend no one to buy it, not to mention it's pretty expensive as it is."
3,"Pure of tone, but wavering musicality","Although Meyer's tone on this particular CD may come near to matching Harold Wright's, his interpretation of the Saint-Saens is replete with musical fallacies, the most obvious of which is the inappropriately brisk tempo. The Saint-Saens particularly vexed me; the first mvt. (Allegretto), in which he hastily stumbled through important phrases such as the d to high d short passage. The tonguing passages were almost stridently quick.For an excellent recording of the Saint-Saens, I would recommend Janet Hilton. Her tone is just as French-sounding as Meyer's, and possibly more so. Her recording of the Poulenc Sonata is just as amazing."
5,Wow is he good,"Was looking for a new recording of some French clarinet music. Looked through the list of many such recordings and found this. Wow, this clarinet player can play. His rendition of the Poulanc is remarkable to hear. If you like this sort of music, this is one of the disks to own. Also a good clean sounding disk. When I ripped this into iTunes, the song list ended up in Japanese so I did have to recreate the list in english."
4,Foods with a Foreign Flavor,"I love collecting different cookbooks. But I especially like the favorite recipes of Home Economic Teachers. I have a variety of these cookbooks. The recipes in these books do not have a lot of pictures, BUT the directions for each of these recipes are extremely detailed and easy to follow.I gave this particular used book a 4 because although the description said it was in extremely good condition, when I received it, the binding in the hardback book had a rip in it and several of the pages had stains on it."
2,not a good description,"I recieved this product in a timely manner, however the description was not correct. It was heavily highlighted and the pages were written in pretty heavily as well. Very unhappy and I feel like I was mislead."
5,It's probably better than the first volume,"Hank Williams. He is a genius, and is a legendary country music artist. His music has inspired many, despite his untimely death in 1952. In 1999, he recieved a collection in UMG's ongoing series '20th Century Masters.' The catalog also gave certain artists a volume 2, and in 2006, Hank was given one.This one, actually, is recommended. I, personally, prefer this one over the 1999 one. Why? Because it has more of my favorites. 'My Bucket's Got A Hole In It,' 'Your Cheatin' Heart,' 'Kaw-Liga' and 'I'm A Long Gone Daddy.'However, be aware that if you buy this, you probably should go ahead and buy volume 1 as well, just because that one has 'Hey Good Lookin',' 'Move It On Over' and several other definitive ones.But still, if you had to pick just one Hank Williams CD to buy, I'd recommend this one. Not for the price, but the sound quality is great, considering the time period of these recordings. This is a very entertaining CD.Recommended. ENJOY!!!"
2,Hardly worth the investment,The information in books like this one becomes dated so quickly that it's hardly worth the investment for most people. You're better off getting this stuff from the library.
2,Useful but fragile,"The pop-up shade is useful to keep light off the lcd screen but it's way too fragile for the price. The outer shade clips tend to chip off and springs on the hinges suddenly fall off. Good idea for a product, just not very durable. Look for the sales!"
2,LCD CAMERA SHADE,"Worked o.k., but not great. Within a week or so the glue portion holding the shade apparently came loose and the shade was lost. Didn't get much use out of it."
3,Usefulness of the item.....,"So far I have not found this item to be of much help in trying to view my LCD screen on my digital camera in bright sunlight.Delkin - eFilm Pop-Up Shade for 2.5-inch LCD's, Black - View Monitors in Full Sunlight!"
4,does the job,"Nice doodad, protects the LCD display, inexpensive, relatively thin, shades reasonably well. I'd buy it again."
4,Great CD!!,I bought this CD 3 or 4 years ago and I still love it! It's hard to believe the music's for a video game. I only wish it had all the songs on it.
5,best sonic cd ever!,This soundtrack is the coolest!It really tells you what sonic adventure 2 is about.My favoite tracks are:1.It Dosen't Matter(theme of sonic)2.Live and Learn(main theme of SA2)3.Thats the Way I Like It(metal harbor)4.E.G.G.M.A.N(theme of Dr.Eggman)and 5.escape from the cityI think that whoever else views this CD will want it.So if you like sonic you'll like this!
2,Tacky barbell,"This barbell looks beautiful on amazon but, once you receive it? You might not be too happy. The ball is clear but, you can see the bar through the ball, the wings look terrible and the gem is too large for something this small."
5,Very Helpful,"I found this book very helpful. I was able to have a completely ""natural"" birth with my daughter 2 years ago and I think this book helped me achieve it. I read it first when I was about 5 months along and then reread it about 2 weeks before I had her. I even took it to the hospital with me. After the birth of my daughter (my doctor said he had never seen anything like that), my doctor asked if he could have the book to read. He was very inspired by it. Since that time I have bought about 5 copies and given them to friends and family members that were pregnant. They were also able to go ""all natural"" and loved the book. I was getting ready to order another one and thought I should write up my success story."
4,Great Information,"I'm not finished reading the book yet but so far I'm very happy with the information provided. It's very interesting to learn the potential side effects of common drugs given during child birth. The ""active birth"" positions seem to make a lot of sense if you want to try natural birth. It's good to know all the facts before going into the birth."
5,"This is THE book to get for an enjoyable, low pain birth!","I highly recommend this book to any woman who wants an enjoyable birth. I was terrified of the pain of birth, but after reading this book felt much more comfortable. I took a Yoga class at the suggestion of the author and my birth was fantastic! I had no episiotomy, no tearing, no epidural and was able to enjoy my baby immediately! This book is a great tool as to what to expect and how to prepare for your ideal birth experience. Get this book!"
1,Kissinger War Criminal,"if you want the evil truth about Dr K and how he undermined the 1968 peace talks, read ""No Peace, No Honor: Nixon, Kissinger, and Betrayal in Vietnam"" by Larry Berman.This book explains how Nixon and Kissinger illegally colluded with SVN and Nguyen Van Thieu - he was told by Nixon via Anna Chenault to ""hold on, we are going to win"" and ""you will get a better deal with us"". So Thieu says he won't talk peace, Nixon wins, Kissinger openly changes sides after working with the Democrats, and together they crank up the war.The point is: The War could have ended in 1968 if it were not for this man - Dr Death himself, Henry Adolf Kissinger!"
1,No install or set up information,These units do not have installation instructions and the website requires you to be a profesional registered installer to get any information.
2,This is not a Bible,"I ordered this ""Bible"" because I was looking for a study bible for one of my son's. This book does include passages from the Bible, but is not in Bible format. In other words, this book takes the Bible and puts it into a different layout. An example is Isaiah is found towards the back of the book. It might be fine for someone whose only desire is to study portions of the Bible, but don't call it a Bible. A Bible flows from Genesis to Revelations. Call it what it is ""A Daily Study Book based on the Catholic Bible"". I am so disappointed!"
3,Arbitrary order of books of the bible,"Short daily excerpts are provided with a selection from the Old Testament and the New Testament from the Revised Standard Version, Catholic edition of the bible. Starting with Jan. 1, the selections are Genesis 1-2 and Mark 1:1-13 and those books continue until completion with an excerpt from Exodus (1-2) starting on Jan. 20 and an excerpt (Romans 1:1-17) starting on Feb. 10. I don't mind the New Testament books being mixed up, but later in the book, the Old Testament books are out of order too. I had hoped to gain a historical, chronological sense of things from Adam and Eve to Revelation. There's no reason given for the order of the books other than the reference to Carmen Rojas'work: How to Read the Bible Every Day which uses a similar scheme. I DO like the daily quotes from saints."
1,"FAULTY Switch, BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE","I needed a switch for my cooling fan. I purchased this switch simply because I thought Hypertech had a good reputation. The switch turns on exactly @ 176 degrees like it should, but won't turn off till 80 degrees, when it supposed to turn off @ 166 degrees. I called Hypertech-Support, and they were of no help... Their support department has no idea how a thermo-switch works and Hypertech should not be in the business. I will never buy anything with the name HYPERTECH."
2,I loved this TV for the 12 months that it lasted. Now it sucks!,"This TV was wonderful for 12 months. Then this strange shadowy line started to appear across the screen - not a horizontal or vertical line - but a distorted ""cloud"". It has gotten worse and now more ""clouds"" are developing. It's gotten to the point where it is too annoying to watch. (And I'm not sure it will be possible to watch much longer.) I would think that a Sylvania should last more than a year!"
2,Good while it lasted,"I purchased this TV (6626LCT) brand new in October 2006 for approximately $600. 18 months later, the unit will not turn on. I called customer support and provided the serial number. They said the TV only comes with a 3 month parts and labor warranty, and a one year parts warranty. So if your unit doesn't die within a year you are out of luck. I told the support rep I would not be buying Sylvania brand again. She didn't care =)I guess its time to upgrade to Plasma and shame on Sylvania for making a TV that dies after a year and a half of normal usage. I have CRT TVs still working from 20 years ago. I will not buy Sylvania electronics ever again, even if they do have a lower upfront price (which is what convinced me on this one)."
1,Temp. TV,"I really think Sylvania should try to make a better light bulbs and leave the TV market to people that really do their research and are already in the busines of TV and HT TV. I have also a Sony HT TV of the same size and this tv can not even come close to it. First of all tuning is so slow it take some time to tune into or goto the next station, picture quality very poor, I don't even know how long it will last but, style is very simple and just black..... I think in this day and age people want to get their moneies worth and if you compare this TV with almost anything els that is out there, it is a shame to pay 500.00 to 700.00 for this LCD TV."
2,My first LCD ..............,"I was quite excited about getting a new LCD tv for my dorm room. Since I had a very limited budget, I bought this tv from [...]a couple weeks ago for only [...]. However, I was quite disapointed with this tv. The tv had dismal black-level performance; no 2:3 pull-down detection; extremely blue color temperature; limited input flexibility. The hdmi cable of my tv didnt even work. The hdmi problem may be just the one I recieved but the picture quality was worse than basically all of those they sell in bestbuy. Thankfully buy.com fully refund my money....Im sticking with brand name tvs for now on."
2,Not an effective grater,This grater is too thin. Not very effective for vegetables or cheese. I am very disappointed.
2,Some Music from Fast and Furious other songs inspired by,Copy Protection is a joke and this should be recalled by Universal/Island. If its true about Sony knowingly using hidden programs on the disc (not a CD) I will be one unhappy camper. Sony/Universal/Island should be ashamed of themselves for letting this be released in the first place. NEGATIVE STARS recall this disc and reissue it with ALL the songs from the film non copy protected so I can enjoy the music on my ipod. A newly released edition of Fast and Furious The complete soundtrack I'd buy that for a dollar.
2,For all who were wondering...,The song played during the FBI-Raid on Chan's house is:Dope - Debonaire (afaik also on Scream 3 soundtrack)
1,WARNING: Copy Protected,"Supposedly this is the first US release of a CD using copy protection that will prevent you from ripping this CD to MP3 (or any other file format) and not play on any computer or DVD player. Included is a special CD player, which `should' allow it to be played on a machine, running Windows (NOTE: Mac, Linux and other alternative operating systems are not supported and should not be able to play this CD at all). I find this business practice to be repulsive and the consumer should act to prevent this. Universal has said that by mid 2002 all it's CD's will use this copy protection.Also know that this has already been cracked but ripping or copying the CD will be a violation of the DMCA and doing so could (theoretically) put you behind bars.(...)"
1,Warning this CD uses copy-protection,I just purchased this CD from Tower and I will now be returning it. It uses copy-protection which prevents ripping to MP3 files and it cannot be played with a standard computer music player.
1,Save Your Money,"It doesn't play at all on my computer. It may be ok music, but it is hard to tell, It sounds lousy on my car stereo. (lots of noise) I'm trying to return the CD now. This was my FIRST and LAST COPY PROTECTED CD, I'LL EVER BUY. I'm now going to download it, because I was told it was good and would still like to give it a listen. Unfortunately I've got no legitimate way to listen to it, even though I bought it. Save yourself the headaches and the money on this copy protected turkey."
4,i have some questions,"does any one know the name of the song when paul walker is driving his green car to race vin for the first time, it is the one that comes on right when the cars drive to the place where they race.email me - drummer4life@cableone.net"
3,"BT is the name of the ""techno"" artist","for the person who wanted to know who was the artist that made the ""techno"" songs , the artist name is called BT, and he's really good as well, highly recommend his ESCM and Emotional Technology cds"
3,cool cd,"this is a cool rock cd and i like hip hop, but u CAN rip this cd if u have a AUDIO cd burner, the ones that hook up to stereosi have ripped this cd (so i could protect my original), but it will not work on a computer one. AUDIO cd burner."
1,Avoid this company!,"Bought a cell phone battery that, of course, died one week past their return/refund deadline. Refused to refund or replace even though the product is CLEARLY defective. This company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again. Consider yourself warned."
4,A good book for third graders,"I liked this book because it was exciting and I learned al lot about Hanukkah. The book is not about eight nights of presents but the other things about Hanukkah, like why we play with driedels. I am in third grade and this book was just at my level."
5,Well Done,"The writer is in the rail industry. He's careful. Both the photos and the text reflect this. This is not an academic history, but it is a first class ticket on a first class story about a first class railroad. Tom Murray is a good writer. It is rare to suggest in the trade that this writer didn't write enough. The selection of photos was done with a finely tuned and patient hand. The result is a book that is not just a pleasure to read; it is a genuine resource about this timeless railroad and its unique story."
3,It's an okay lotion,"This is an okay, but not great, lotion. It didn't bronze especially well. It did have a nice smell and texture. However, for the normal price, it wasn't something I would buy gain. The price through Amazon is much cheaper and makes it a better deal."
2,Rantings with occasional moments of enlightenment,"Why I liked it:Some theories dealt with in the book hit close to home, and made me think a bit about life and its real purpose.Why I didn't like it:Most of the book projected cliché philosophical thoughts and the writer's rantings began to bother me after a bit. It was as if he was trying to get some thoughts across but could not clearly explain them. At times, it reminded me of a high school essay."
1,Hopeless,"This book is really pathetic. The 'ideas' in it are so mundane you'll know you wasted your money by about 10 pages in. The book hasn't been proofread. If you're like me and prefer your books to have most of the typos taken out, then you'll really find this book irritating. You might quit smoking just so you don't have to read any more quit smoking books like this one."
5,It's in the Cards for You to Buy This Book,"Being a Psychic and Relaxation Therapist, I intuitively ordered Nic the Habit, not for myself-I'm a non smoker-but for 3 of my clients who claimed they wanted to stop smoking if only there was something that would help them stop smoking, short of the patch. Nic the Habit proved to be that magical something. Of the 3 clients, the 2 men are: a Physican and a Construction Worker; the woman is a Hairdresser with her own Salon. All were under high stress and used smoking as a crutch until they read Nic the Habit and found out they were poisioning themselves. The author really did his homework. He lists thousands of toxic chemicals and other scientific data without making the book stuffy and hard to read. This book has bridged the conundrum of how to be scientific yet spiritual. I loved this book. And if you are a smoker or someone you love is a smoker-it's in the cards for you to buy this book."
4,Good back support,"This was a life saver for me when I cracked a disc. It's a little clumsy to put on. The velcro sticks to everything, including your clothes. It also stretches after several wearings and doesn't give the same firm feeling as the first few times you wear it. Despite the criticisms, it does what it's supposed to do and that is support your back and hold it in place. I would recommend the product."
3,Remake Uhh!,"I had high hopes for this flim BUT No!!! God they could of made a better film for the money they spent on this few LAUGHS gags that I got.They needed to worked the plot a lot more.The star power was'nt that bad they should've demanded a better script from the writers.The film set in the 1990- 97 okay was hard at best,because the old show was set in WW2 and that was great,and the 97 film was hard to watch because there was no real plot at all.Tim Curry as the world second best terrorist okay that sound like a plot I'd guess!! I 'll watch the DVD when I need see something GOFFY on Saturday. I love flim with HighJinks but this one falls short some what.I BE NICE AND GIVE 3 STARS."
4,Could use some 'Fiddling' With,"A fairly good, and funny, little movie that sometimes lacks pace. MCHALE'S NAVY is well-cast and acted out, but, as I said, is rather slow in too many scenes.Great when you see it the first time...second time: ""Hey, let's fast-forward this to this part..."" Many movies are no fun to watch over and over and over again, and this just happens to be one of them.But, Tom Arnold, Tim Curry, and David Alan Grier keep the movie somewhat interesting and entertaining. Arnold's the perfect hero...Curry's the perfect villain, and Grier's the perfect...well, maybe perfect isn't the word...he's a hoot, though!Local bootlegger, Quinton McHale gets an unwanted reunion with former rival Vladikof, the world's SECOND best terrorist. That's basically what the movie's about; their conflicts.All-in-all, fairly safe for kids over 8. More explosions than profainity."
1,disappointing,"I really looked forward to this movie. 2 words, very disappointing. I enjoyed the original series very much. It was nothing(ok, it was about the Navy) like the original. I watched it once, no desire to watch it again. And, Tom Arnold? They could have done a lot better with almost any other actor. There are a few(very few) times, I've liked Tom Arnold. He is not a comedic actor. He's tried many times, why does he keep trying? If you like McHale's Navy, watch the original McHale's Navy. If you like Tom Arnold, try the movie, but I believe you will still be disappointed."
2,an ok B movie,If you are a fan of the old series this movie isn't worth your time and effort.If you don't mind an ok B movie with a few funny moments from a cast much better than the material it is given (unfortunately the cast manages to sink to its level) then you won't mind it.I really can't recommend you spend money on this one. Wait for the actual series to make it to DVD (what's keeping it?)
4,Another Great for Tom Arnold!,"McHale's Navy isOne of the cleanest and funniest dramedies of all time.Tip: Don't forget to view Tom Arnold's other films, as he attempts to out do ArnoldSchwartzenegger. har har maety."
2,Not sure!,"I tried this software and every time I tried to burn data to a cd, it always formated the disk for 40-54 minutes. I have Nero home basics, which came with my new DVD burner, and it never tried to format any cd!! I tried the Nero after I got the Roxio. Maybe its me not knowing enough about the software but I uninstalled it."
2,good if it works,"roxie support does exist, but it's hard to get to; phone support is long waits, but helpful when you get it. still waiting on 2 e-mails sent to support 10 days ago. The little i have been able to use the product, it was easy to use and productive."
1,Buggy Piece of...Software,"Dubs CDs OK, but nothing else seems to work correctly on Vista, including DVD creation (no audio -- nice!) and conversion of FLAC files to audio CDs (thanks for all the new coasters, Roxio!). Delay after delay on the patches, too. Avoid this disaster!"
1,Too Buggy to be Useful,"I had hoped to use this software to make slide shows on DVDs. No luck --- the software crashed every time I tried to do anything with my photos. I pursued several different suggestions from the users' forum on the Roxio website, but nothing worked. I have a fast one-year old Dell with 1 GB memory, running XP, so hardware should not have been a problem.The only success I have had with Roxio is burning backup data disks. That hardly justifies spending about $ 70."
1,You'll be sorry....,"First, you will be lucky if the product installs at all.Next, you may find it does not like your video card, and MyDVD may refuse to run.I stuck with 7.5 after uninstalling 9. 7.5 is buggy too, but at least you can make a DVD.If you need to produce a DVD of any size, look elsewhere. You will waste a lot of time.The 5 start reviews here either did try to produce a large DVD and/or are shills."
2,I should have stuck with version 8,"Version 9 has been a big disappointment and my goal is to get it working almost as well as Version 8 did. So far, this has included two reinstalls, plus my first attempt at messing around with my computer registry, to get Cineplayer to work. I still have not located the still-capture function on Cineplayer.I have also had to do extensive reading on how to burn gapless CDs, since the Disc-at-Once function no longer does this. (The answer is that you must use the Music Disc Creator function.)In short, if you already have Version 8, there is no need to upgrade."
1,crudware,"I have used many of the prior versions in this series, and bought this tool based on my experience with those. Older ""Easy ____ Creator"" tools where normally solid performers, sometimes glitzy, sometimes not, but always just worked. This tool on the other hand tries to be glitzy, but never just works. My biggest issue was with the ""Video wave"" sub-tool that would run slowly and freeze up randomly (to the point that I had to reboot to kill off the processes, even task manager wasn't able to kill it) so that either I had to save every time I did anything, or loose all my work every time I tried to use the program."
1,"Crashes, hangs, runtime errors, and NO customer support","I've spent more time trying to get this program to work than with any other software. It seems to only work on a clean system with just the OS (In my case, Windows XP), but as soon as you start adding other programs--look out! Features begin to crash, freeze, and have runtime errors galore. The ONLY solution Roxio can provide is to do a ""clean install."" This involves removing the program, all program folders, and all registry entries, then reinstalling. The whole process takes over an hour, although I've gotten a lot quicker at it because I've had to do it so many times. After all that work--nothing! Same problems. I keep going to the web site HOPING they will have an update that will fix these bugs, but so far--nothing. Some features do work well, but these tend to be the add-ons (Drag to Disk and PC Backup), but I'm unable to use it for its primary purpose (CD & DVD creation). Until Roxio fixes the bugs, don't get it!"
2,Easy Media Ceator 9 instead of fixing 8?,"Instead of fixing major bugs in version 8, not only does Roxio come up with a version 9, they keep emailing me to purchase an upgrade? My version 7 and 8 kept giving me major problems. I have many other software on my computer including photoshop, premiere, etc. The ONLY software I'm having problems with is Roxio. It crashes, freezes my computer, refuses to open, etc. Support is NONE EXISTANT!!! I have yet to speak to anyone who isn't having major problems with this software. Whenever there are a large number of bad reviews on this program, it is followed by a few people who rave about the product. Most of these people must work for Roxio. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!! Complete money grubbing company who do not care whatsoever about their customers."
2,Poor photo functions,"I upgraded from EMC 7.5 to EMC 9 expecting improved interfaces and functionality. I was quite disappointed in the photo editing and printing functions. I can't print a full page with multiple photos. I received an acknowledgement of the problems, but so far no other response. I sent in problem reports over two weeks ago. Editing is awkward to say the least. Cropping requires too many steps, once you figure out what they are. I am returning to EMC 7.5 until either the problems are resolved or another program is available that provides the functioanlity of EMC 7.5."
1,Roxio EMC 9,"I bought this Roxio EMC 9 to update my version '7' & had nothing but trouble with it. I contacted Roxio several times & got absolutely no satisfaction from them. I finally just 'bit the bullet' for the $70 I paid, uninstalled it & reinstalled my EMC 7 & it's working great for everything I need. I keep getting emails for big bargains on Roxio's new EMC 10 but, after reading the reviews from those who've bought it, I realize it's no better than their awful EMC 9. Hope they can improve the program sometime soon & I may update but till then I'm sticking with my '7'."
1,Worthless piece of crap,"I made the mistake of buying the piece of junk against my better judgment. It will lock up when you try to burn a DVD. I tried re-installing it three times with the same result. The ""repair"" option from the Install disk causes set-up to freeze. Tech support is worse than a joke. I plan to go skeet shooting this weekend: so I will at least get some use out of this disaster."
2,Could not even get it to start,"I started out with Roxio 7 and 7.5 which was great. I figured 9 would be realy cool so I went and bought it online and downloaded it. It took 1/2 day to download, and then when I tried to use the software I kept getting a windows error saying windows encountered an error and has to close down. I contacted Roxio regarding this issue, but to no avail. I evently returned the software and bought Nero 7 enhanced."
2,Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 9,The program is OK. It's not worth the cost of the product. Not easy to use.
1,Why Bother,"If clunky software that battles with the Windows Vista Platform and continues to cause errors and other software to stop working is your choice of fun..........go for it. Otherwise, why bother. Sure it works in Windows Vista but save your money and go for Nero. Just not worth the trouble. Good for freeware or possibly as an arcade prize in an amusement park. Perhaps they can melt all the Creator 9 software disks down and make them into ash trays."
2,Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 9 (older version),"This is an older version I installed on an older PC. It did not work well at all for me. Extremely slow and difficult to work with. It may have been due to limited resources on the PC. I have now upgraded to a newer, faster PC with more memory and will try to reinstall and see if it improves the speed. However. I still think the software package is difficult to understand and use."
1,Many problems no support,"Purchased EMC 9 and loaded program, only about 50% of he many functions launched with out errors. I then attempt to solve problems (no support numbers or info listed anywhere) went to the web site for info. Support consisted of ask Roxanne a datbase search and then a no response from a submitted form. If it loads and runs it may be a good deal, if it doesn't you should have donated the money to charity. Check out the support before you buy or you will be sorry."
1,Listen to the Majority!,"This program is getting bad reviews for a good reason, it is a bad program. Roxio may have something up their sleeve in the future but don't lose hours of your life sitting in front of your computer frustrated with this one."
2,Errors - UNLIMITED,"I am not a computer engineer but know a little bit about the computer, enough to repair, assemble, load software, and such.First of all they have not resolved their problems with the Windows XP operator system.I found that Easy Media Creator 9 has unlimited number of errors. It refuses to read simplest of audio files.. WAV. It freezes when combining simplest of video files ... AVI. etc.I will not buy another Roxio product and would never recommend one.Going to get help from ""Customer Service"" is impossible also."
2,Rushed to the market before it is stable,"I tried something relatively simple - create a DVD using myDVD. Roxio kept crashing with a ""pure virtual function call"" error message. So I removed 4 of the videos that were apparently causing this error, and let the program steam ahead overnight to run the conversion. In the morning the status was stuck on 16% complete, and wouldn't budge for the rest of the day. Roxio needs to do more beta testing on this product so that it can detect wmv videos it cannot encode. The features look nice but I don't have much patience for buggy software."
5,Amazing and Wonderful,"I love using this program. It was given to me for my birthday over the weekend, and I've had so much fun playing with it. I have already mastered PIP's, and adding audio was easy as pie. Definitely recommend it. Using it and loving it. Been running smooth with no problems on my 3.4ghz with 1gb memory computer."
1,Should be a no star available,Bought this program. Intalled it. Tried to copy home dvd movies. Roxio locks up. reboot. still doesn't work. Piece of crap software. save your money and go buy Nero.
1,Product is destructive,"Installed the product. Because of numerous crashes, I then unsinstalled the product. The product failed to completely uninstall, giving numerous C++ errors.Now my Windows cd/dvd-burning facility is brain dead. I will probably have to do a Windows re-install.Attempts to call Roxio support have been in vain.VERY DANGEROUS PRODUCT. DON'T USE IT!"
1,Save Your Money,"Need to catch a mouse? Then avoid TomKat mouse traps. I bought six of them and used peanut butter as bait. For 5 days, each morning the peanut butter was gone from all six, but none were ever set off. Then I bought TomKat's spin trap (yes, glutton for punishment) - the mouse never went inside these traps (probably too full from eating off the other traps all week). Tom Kat traps simply don't work - triggers are not at all sensitive. A totally waste of money."
1,Not sensative at all,This trap's trigger mechanism is in no way sensitive enough to kill the mouse. I had 4 traps set in close proximity to where the mouse has been coming to get at our breads. They were all baited with a small amount of peanut butter so it couldn't take the bait and run. Every trap had the bait eaten off the next morning and none of them had been triggered. Do not use this trap if you want to catch your mouse.
5,Two for two in one night,"I set four traps in my basement last night, two with peanut butter on the plastic trigger, two with peanuts jammed under the plastic triangle. In the morning, two traps were activated resulting in two dead mice. Interestingly, for the activated traps, there was one of each type of bait.I used needle nose pliers to raise the plastic triangle bait holder to fit the peanut underneath. The bait therefore was very secure and required the mouse to work hard in order to steal the bait. The results were effective (and gruesome) - one mouse was caught with its mouth firmly biting on the peanut."
5,"""DON'T"" PATENT IT YOURSELF","An astounding book with all of Attorney David Pressman's knowledge about Patents in 572 pages. He makes you think twice (and more) about filing pro se, and although not said, he underlines that you need to be a genius to understand the instructions, the rules and the Patent Laws and to follow through successfully."
4,"Rich, useful and by itself","I found this book an excellect study, a new interpretation that brings more clarity to the post-World War II urban industrial experience for Pittsburgh's African Americans. It brings new material to bear compared to Dickerson's Out of this Crucible from an earlier generation. It's not easy getting a full picture of the African American work world as an urban industrial economy is in precipitous decline. Hinshaw's study is a an excellent first crack at this subject. I've assigned this study several times to my students and it has gone over very well."
1,Another disappointment,"I decided to read this book over the summer in an attempt to give John Hinshaw's writing/editing another chance to impress me. The end result? Another disappointment. His writing displayed a tremendous lack of clarity, and I also question his judgment in his use of words and phrases to describe his topic - steel and steelworkers. His style, lack of transitions, and disregard for basic writing rules surprise me for a professor with his credentials. I suggest he read a ""Student's Guide for Writing History Papers"" and use it to help improve his writing and research techniques."
3,Barney: We love our Family,This DVD video was cut directly from the TV show. Nice episodes but my daughter has seen each 100 times.
1,Glad I got it used,"I found a copy of this in a used bookstore for a very low price. I'm glad I did. If I paid the full price, I would have felt very cheated. The book is too slight. I'm a beginner to Texas Holdem Poker, but the book's tips were not much more useful than what I had already found for free on the internet."
2,Too Basic,"I understand this was written for beginners, but I found the book to keep things too simple for too long. After a while, it became repetitive and I would have liked a more challenging approach. The author is certainly witty and charming enough, and on the subway to work, the book is engaging, but I felt it lacked something."
4,Better than I expected,"I was kind of leary of reading this book at first just by looking at other reviews. Some people complain of grammatical and other errors, and others complain about complexicity. Personally, I really enjoyed the book. There were very few mistakes when comparing to the total number of written pages. Yes, the story line was complex, and yes, there are a large amount of characters, but as you begin to read on, everything falls into place. I was kind of disappointed at the end of the two deaths (I won't mention). I cannot wait to read the sequel to this. I would also recommend that this book be read twice instead of just one time...just to fill in gaps and things you might have missed."
4,A page turner and note taker in one,"This book was suggested to me by a friend who is in a different sorority than I, and I must say that I'm glad she did. Once I picked it up, it was difficult to put down. I could relate to the story very well by being in a sorority myself and felt as if I knew some of the characters personally. I rated this book 4 stars out of 5 only because of the numerous characters and story lines. I actually had to take notes, and flip back through chapters to refresh my memory. Other than that, the book was excellent and is a must read, but don't forget your pen and paper!"
3,"More people, more secrets...","This book was interesting in its own way. As previous people have said, there was just too many people featured here. Because of that, the flow was not smooth. I found myself turning back constantly to keep the characters straight. When the secrets started to unfold, you really needed a scorecard. The sorority involvement was interesting. It brought back many memories for me during college. I would recommend this book with a warning to get out a pen and pad to keep the characters in check. The finale of all this was interesting."
5,Body Rhythm Rocks!,"This band is very aptly named, the rhythms can really reach your body, making it very difficult to sit still while listening. ""Deja Blue"", ""Cuban Strut"", and ""Ghost Dance"" are particularly fine. Definitely highly recommended!"
1,I thought it was a parody,"Quite possibly the worst recording in history.I purchased this CD because (1) the songs and (2) I collect women singers. When I first played this CD I immediately grabbed up the CD case because I thought I had missed something - surely this was a parody? A put-on? I can find no indication that this CD is anything but a ""serious"" effort.I have no idea what sort of person would have the courage (gall?) to produce this album, but they couldn't have received adequate remuneration to compensate for the damage to their reputation.Just horrid."
2,"Has potential, but didn't make it.","I loved this scooper when I first got it. I chose it for it's ability to be cleaned in the dishwasher, and the great reviews on its scooping capability. However, now after three months of use, the handle is starting to separate a slight bit from the scooper. This causes a slight wobble in scooping, but it also causes water to seep into the opening while in the dishwasher. When I remove from dishwasher, water comes dripping out. I'm afraid over time this situation will deteriorate, and perhaps cause rust or mildewing in the interior of the scoop.Addendum: I contacted Cuisinart, whose reply was that they contract out their small kitchen gadgets and therefore cannot send a replacement. They said they would refund me it if I send it back, which is pointless since the shipping cost would come close to the product cost. I will no longer buy Cuisinart gadgets, since the company clearly takes no responsibility for the product quality."
5,Best ice cream scoop ever!,"This is the best ice cream scoop I've ever used. It cuts through even hard ice cream like a hot knife through butter, and the handle is extremely comfortable - thick and substantial so it can cut through the ice cream without a hint of bending, but contoured to fit the hand."
2,worked for my aiwa sorta but get a new player instead,get a better record player instead of buying this. it works for my cheap aiwa but not as well as it should. its cheap and i had to sand down some plastic because it kept hitting my records.
5,Record savour,"This product brought out some old tunes I have not heard in ages. My record player was in storage for twelve years with a bad stylus. Putting the new stylus on brought that old record player to life and I have it by my entertainment center once again. Excellent product at a reasonable price not to mention a memory "" revivellizer""."
2,Blinded by Celebrity,"Joseph Bosco had a permanent seat at the O.J. Simpson trial,so you would think he would have something new to add.Unfortunately,he was so mezmerized by Mr. Simpson and his attorneys,that he must have forgotten to take notes during the prosecution phase of this trial,so what the reader ends up with is a rehash of the Dream Team's smoke and mirror act.One of the most telling statements arrives early in the book,when Mr. Bosco states that he can't understand why when he went back to his hotel every night and turned on the TV,Mr. Simpson didn't look sincere,as he claims,he apparently did when you watched him in person.The camera never lies,Mr. Bosco.It always knows when you're telling the truth and when you're lying.That's why some actors become stars,and others fade away after one movie.This is a great book for anyone who either can't or won't remember what the evidence really was."
4,Tap shoes-great fit,"This tap shoes are for my son,he wears size 6 regularly and size 8.5 is good for him.Comfortable,look good. Not leather,unfortunately."
1,Junk,"The shoes, marked ""size 8"", arrived. They were at least size 10 maybe larger; totally unsuitable! Because they were marked the size we ordered, we paid shipping to get rid of them.So, the shoes we ended up, with from a regular store, actually cost us much more than they should have. DO NOT BUY SHOES FROM AMAZON!!!"
5,Great Job Bob!,This book is a must for anyone taking care of cardiac patients. I had older editions when a resident and fellow. Am an attending now and picked up the new edition as its a good little reference book. Still use it to brush-up on stuff before 'pimping' residents and fellows!
4,Good,Haven't used it yet but it came with the lid broken so that stinks! Other than that I think it should be good!
2,Barely acceptable,"This Frosted Glass paint is barely acceptable. It works...sort of...but only after many many layers. Unfortunately it is very difficult to get an even coat on without streaks or other imperfections. So, after adding many layers to get any kind of 'frosting' the result looks...well....bad.And then when it is finally on and dry, a fingernail scrap takes it off again without any effort.I am sure this product has its applications, but for now I can only see it as a last resort."
3,Not the best tea from Celestial,This is bland. Not one of the best teas from Celestial. Try Red Zinger or Apple Cinnamon Spice instead.
2,Play Somewhere Else,"Average. I felt like this was a book in search of a story. The author certainly filled the prerequisite of putting a lot of words on the pages but unfortunately they do not do anything together. I was looking for a tight, risky book - much as the dust jacket implies, but I got something much less entertaining. The only good thing I can say is that not many of the words had over 5 letters in them."
1,missing items,"my order included 3 items, only one came and no clue where the other 2 are. i contancted amazon n they said the only option i have is to return and get my money back"
3,No way these will last 50-100 years....,"I bought these because they were eco-friendly and figured they would hold up in my children's binders. I paid $25 for a box of 25, assuming they were coated or something to allow them to 'last 50-100 years'. No such luck. It is November and they are holding up no better than the folders I can get for 10 cents right before school starts."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"The first review hit the nail on the head. I didn't listen to him figuring that something would have been said if these were not the originals. The groups are treasures, these versions of the songs are not. I was just looking for Reflections of My Life, thought the other selections looked pretty good so I bought this cd. If you only want that selection lucky for you, that one is not totally bad, the rest are. They are apparently outtakes and it is evident they are practice, looking for the right feel, not finding it yet. Evidently they did which is why the cd was made, unfortunately the originals were not used, if these were the final product the songs would never have been released."
2,The Wizard of Snore,"I had high hopes for this remake of H.G. Lewis' The Wizard of Gore based solely on the casting of Crispin Glover as Montag the Magnificent. Unfortunately this opportunity for a fun revamping turned out to be horribly directed and acted garbage that has none of the energy found in the original. The biggest problem is Kip Pardue, an actor who delivers his lines like he's reading the ingredients off a cereal box. Since he's the main character the film spends 90% of its time on him, and it makes for a very dull viewing experience. Lewis fans looking for the ""gore"" of the title will also be left sorely disappointed. Even Glover is disappointing, approaching the Montag character as more of an evangelist than a magician. The best parts of the movie belonged to Brad Dourif and Jeffrey Combs, two actors that could teach the kids in it a thing or two about how to properly go over-the-top. Coming on the heels of 2001 Maniacs, The Wizard of Gore just doesn't measure up."
3,Glover of Gore,"Mr. Glover made it so! I really liked this one, especially cause I thought I'd hate it. The original film was cheesy and awesome and fun in its own right. But these old films have something of an advantage over the remakes. Time. In my humble opinion, remakes usually suck. Especially with the crutch of technology. Somehow this one worked for me - not crazy about the all the cgi in the more recent movies, but Mr. Glover brought it home! Good for the collection."
4,"Update in style, production and arrangement gives new life","The first official Graveland album, before ""Epilogue"" and ""In the Glare of Burning Churches"" summarized copious demo tapes, was ""Carpathian Forests."" On this album were majestic metal melodies slashed out in fast punkish riffing, with unholy screeching and mounds of feedback and chaotic distortion swarming over the music. It was difficult to hear, the songs were basic, and for many, the vision was not real. Fast forward: having perfected his studio work in its mixture of keyboards, sampled sounds and well-toned but frenetically distorted guitar, the mastermind behind Graveland re-creates these songs in longer, more subtle arrangements with stratospheres of instrumental contributions stacked on simple riffs played well on a backgrounded guitar. The result is probably best for recommended for Graveland fanatics, but its appeal also exists anyone who relishes an immersion in music like an unfamiliar daydream."
2,Convenience is too PRICEY!,"I ordered a Ty Girlz doll that retails for $11.99 at a store in Houston, Tx. Because the store is located in suburbs 25 miles from my home, my sister suggested I order it online. To do this, not only did I have to pay a premium for the actual doll but I also had to pay excessively for shipping. In total, the ""convenience"" of ordering this product online cost me an additional 60% more than the full retail value. Next time I will plan better and not order from this toy store."
5,a present,he is collecting them becasue they are his favorite series and would love to have them all so we will see
1,Do not buy!!!!!!!!,"What a horrible piece of garbage. 4 months installed and the screen does not work. The radio and clock work, but from all the reviews i have seen, i am not the only one suffering the GPX curse.Stay away from this company."
2,I have to join this discussion.I think this book is boring.,"Thanks to the other reviewers who had the guts to say that they didn't like this book. I bought it and was very disappointed in the rooms it pictures. Fuddy-duddy, frumpy, phony, and ""too studied"" come to mind when I look at these rooms. I think the rooms look rather old and drab too. They certainly are nothing like the bright and lively country French and northern Italian country style that I adore."
1,A dull little book,"I'm sorry I got this. If you want dull decorating, buy this book. I'd say that it's aimed at people like my mother, but even she is cooler than this. It's full of dull, traditional, expected, ""by the book"" decorating. There's nothing fresh or new about this. If you want ordinary, traditional, old style, you don't need a book to create it. If you want a fresh sparkle or idea, find a better book than this one. Maybe people with no style of their own will find this appealing. I can't imagine why."
1,Glasses crack VERY easily,"I really thought I was getting a good deal on these glasses especially since I've always thought Anchor Hocking products were good. However, 4 of these glasses have chipped or have a ""hairline"" fracture already. None have been hit against anything else. I can only imagine they lightly touched each other in the process of washing. Amazon really should remove these from their lineup. Someone else had made a similar comment about these glasses, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. My mistake."
1,"shame on you, learning curve!","I have spent hours on the phone only to discover that my son's new Take n Play sets (like Misty Island) will only be compatible with his Take Along sets (like Sodor Mountain) if I spend a fortune buying (yet again) new tracks! Seems Learning Curve, while selling all these expensive thomas toys doesn't make enough money off the costly trains, they have to change the track up every time something new comes out! My son loves thomas alot and I feel we get taken advantage of with all of this. Very disappointed. I know Fisher Price is taking over the diecast trains now... I sure hope they can do a better job at it!"
5,"These tracks match our ""take Along"" stuff",No need to buy a new set for more tracks I am happy to have these tracks and they go along with Take Along and Take N play the newer version...I believe.
1,battery problems,I bought this light a year ago for use during black-outs or when I was working on the car. The light was never used for more then five hours total and the battery is already dead (it will only hold a charge for about five minutes). The light is good and I do recommend this light if you have the option to leave it plugged in; but if you're looking for a good cordless light look elsewhere.
5,Differing opinion on the Serenade,"While the previous reviewers by no means gave the Serenade for Strings poor ratings, they did leave the impression that this work received a less than satisfying reading from Orbelian and the Moscow Chamber Orchestra.I would like to differ and tell you that the Opus 48 Serenade in no way diminishes the worth of this disc. While it is arguably difficult to compete with the Orpheus reading, this performance of one of the most beautiful string works in the repertoire leaves little to be desired.Don't stay away from this disc on its account."
1,Frivolous,"I got this book as a gift from a friend of mine. Unfortunately it was trite and tiresome. Nothing of real substance, but a riot for dilletantes or those with time to read but without the mind to know what to read. It barely skims the surface of the things rambles about."
1,Can You Believe What Lennox Says?,"Very early in the book in his discussion of the origin of the use of ""Dixieland"" to describe the Southern US States,"" Lennox indicates that the purported author of the famous song, ""Dixie,"" Daniel Emmett, was a Black man. In fact, Emmett was a Caucasian member of a then-popular minstrel troupe known for derogatory Blackfaced impersonations. Published photograps of Emmett leave little doubt as to his heritage. As a matter of fact, the authorship of ""Dixie"" remains in question since it was copyrighted well after the song became popular. Perhaps this is the only factual error in the book, but one must wonder."
2,A lightweight book - some factual errors.,"This book has some interesting tidbits, but overall it is a very light read. Anyone who is looking for deep research or expanded explanations will end up disappointed by the author's breezy examinations.The book also has a few flat out errors. One example is in the section explaining the phrase ""the die is cast"". While the author does correctly attribute the saying to Julius Caesar, he incorrectly ties the words to the act of throwing dice. Actually, the ""die"" refers to a molded metal piece used to make other metal pieces (such as the template for stamping coins). Once the die is ""cast"" in the metallurgic sense (same as ""cast iron""), it cannot be changed or modified. Hence its use by Casar when crossing the Rubicon. Games of chance had nothing to do with it.""Now You Know"" will take an hour or so to get through, and won't substantially add anything to your life except a few (somewhat accurate) vignettes on word and phrase origin. My verdict is: skip it."
3,"smooth, sleek","This board is sleek and modern. It's a little difficult to hang because you have to hang it on 2 nails that are EXACTLY spaced. I have a very expensive mirror by this company, too. Hanging it was just as difficult. This board looks good, expensive. It's smaller than I thought, even though I measured it out. Overall I would recommend it. It seems expensive, but I can't find anything comparable for lower cost."
4,Great Product,"I bought this because I have a collection of refrigerator magnets from our travels and my new refrigerator has a non-magnetic dooorThis solved the problem. The board looks elegant, all the magnets fit on it along with other notes. Installation was easy - I put two pushpins at the bottoom for the board to rest on (it hangs from the top) for stability.Packagin it arrived in was good.It would have been nice if the stainless steel was glossier - it emits a dull glaze, would have earned it 5 stars in my book !"
4,old tunes,"old, great songs that were worn out on my records. good price fast shipping same good shopping experience."
3,Great Songs -- Poor Production,"I love the songs on this album. Eaglesmith has a major talent for songwriting. He captures the life gone wrong but still trying better than any other songwriter out there. When I've heard these songs live, I've loved them (especially Codiene with Willie).But and this is a big but...When the violins come in, this album goes from stark and compelling to just plain sappy."
4,Great for foreign language learning,"We just received our copy of Just Grandma and Me software by Mercer Mayer and The Learning Company. This and several other CD-ROM titles by Mercer Mayer can be played in several languages including German, perfect for our bilingual family! My two-year-old listened to it about 4 times in his first session. The story is straightforward and leaves nice pauses between sentences so mom or dad can repeat or explain if necessary. These titles would be great for elementary school age kids as well.Just make sure if you're running Windows XP to get the latest version. I highly recommend this game/read-aloud storybook."
1,LEAN?,"If this book is filled with insights from experts in lean manufacturing, then why did the 4/27/98 issue of Fortune report a $63M loss with profits down 150% on their client company (Western Atlas). If that's what it means to become lean, I'll pass. If I'm looking for guidance on lean manufacturing, I'll go look at some Kaizen books. I'm not impressed........."
1,Horrible Software,"I cannot believe how many hours of my life I have wasted trying to get this upgrade to work. I should have listened to the reviews! Ever since I installed a software update online for iDVD, I have not been able to burn DVDs that can be watched in regular DVD players (video too choppy) but at least I could watch those DVD using my Mac. Now that I've spent money to upgrade to '08, the video quality is SO poor that the DVDs are of no use to me at all. The video won't even preview in iDVD - freezes two seconds in. Complete waste of money. Wait until Apple gets its act together before you waste your money."
3,Not For Hyper Pups,"I bought this for days when we leave the pup for over an hour to keep our him hydrated. On the first use, it lasted about two seconds before my lab knocked it over (all over). I think that it would do better for a small dog that's not too hyper."
4,great series,"I had no idea what to expect as I purchased it due to reviews I read on Amazon and I am pleased to say I really enjoyed this series and can't wait for the second series. It has an interesting story line, good actors and lots of action."
1,Show had lots of potential but in the end buying this is futile,FlashForward had an interesting premise and some inate potential but in the end it's an utterly useless proposition. At least half of the characters were annoying as hell and when I say annoying I mean Nikki and Paulo from LOST type of annoying. The quality of the writing changed radically from episode to episode as well. And then there's the unfortunate fact that the series wasn't renewed last week which means that buying this set is akin to buying part of a novel that will never be completed. I truly feel sorry for those customers who wasted their hard earned money on this.
1,misleading title,"this package had arms and abs of steel, abs of steel3, and thighs of steel. the title says buns of steel package but there's no buns tape! i will be returning this product because pf this and the fact that i already ordered abs of steel 3 and the package didnt specify that was the tape included!"
3,great little ipod station,"I needed something fast in order to have some ambient music in the background at a telescope party. I received this unit in about 2 days! Thanks Amazon. As far as sound goes it is not the best: it has very little bass(you can tell by how light this thing is. But it does what you need it to do for forty bucks. It charges the ipod and it allows for toggling from song to song from the unit. I would recommend this unit only to people that don't need bass in their mix. I was looking at getting the jvc kaboom, but that thing is 250! That boom box is like a rock concert on your shoulder. So there just doesn't seem to be a very good middle ground. Good luck"
1,Conditionally recommended,"Recommended if:* you eat steak well done.* you're ""sort of"" a photographer.* you do your best to work words like ""narrative,"" ""maudlin"" and ""hegemony"" in everyday conversations.* you find North Korea to be novel/quirky, and you feel cutting-edge and transgressive reminding people of that fact. Soviet Russia may also apply.* the bubbles in soda hurt your tongue.* you use the word ""appropriation"" a lot when you talk about music.* you've ever used the phrase ""the perfect pop song"".* you like to use the word ""white"" in a derogatory way. (Bonus points if you're white)* you'd like to visit Europe, some day...* you see your life as sort of a French existentialist novel. (Bonus points if all you've ever read is a bit of Sartre and Camus) (BONUS bonus points if you learned about Camus through that Cure song)"
4,3 for 3; Not many bands achieve this splendour...,"For this album, their third, Camera Obscura chose to remain shackled to the past, and our listening pleasure is all the better for it.The intro, ""Lloyd, I'm Ready To Be Heartbroken"" has Phil Spector written all over it, which is a good thing, as it's possibly the catchiest song they've ever managed to come up with. Along with the aforementioned name-drops, you should add a little Roy Orbison, Jan & Dean, and a whole lotta Brian Wilson. Kill surf city indeed!I rated this album equally to their first two efforts; there was obviously a conscious decision to bolster their sound, but they didn't abandon it completely, as the title track and ""Country Mile"" exemplify.Absolutely worth picking up. Great little pop album that fits snugly into any music collection."
1,Not a good product...,"defective product... very disappointed... I got it brand new but the Open/Close button, the Volume UP, the Tuner up and the MEM up button none of them work."
2,An extended tabloib column,"This is not a profound book. Though at times comical and endearing it reads a bit like an extended tabloid column. There is a tendency at trivializing the events in the former soyuz (the union) with the aim of offering us a pastiche of civil society there, but there is little effort to go beyond the events. The post-modern title is very telling in that sense."
2,Watch the seminar,Very disappointed in this book! Very vague ideas and sections. The Chief tried taking his seminar and putting it into written form. Highly recommend the DVD.
2,The Loved Ones,"I did not ""love"" this movie. I watched the whole thing but only because I was in a remote location where there was no signal available to do anything else at the time. I would not recommend it to anyone, not just because it was extremely violent and gory but because the acting was horrible. I gave it 2 stars because I watched it, otherwise it would have only 1 star. It could have been worse. No oscars for this one."
3,"Interesting attempt, but uses transliteration","An interesting attempt at creating a Yiddish translation of the beloved children's classic. This is an ""official"" version of the book, using the original illustrations. Unfortunately (and this is a major drawback) except for the first paragraph of each chapter, the book is entirely in transliteration: it does not present Yiddish using the Hebrew alphabet. While this might be a boon to some, it is a definite drawback to students of Yiddish and native speakers."
4,like it,It was just as described. Really like it. Shipped and received quickly. Looks professional. Got this for a home based business and it looks professional.
1,Nothing but Money-Grubbing Propaganda,"This book is nothing but propaganda to get people to hand over more money to the church. Jesus never said that you can ""invest"" your worldly money in the church to receive rewards in heaven. Yes, he said you should give your money away, but the point is not to do it in order to receive riches in heaven.Funny that most of the people passing this book out are pastors. Do you think they might have something to gain from convincing people of this author's premise?"
2,Not her best!,I was not impressed with this story. It was really hard for me to identify with and like Miranda. She was such a wimp and cried all the time.
5,Good centaur,"Even though he is holding a weapon, this is a kinder, gentler-looking centaur than the fierce, black-haired one from Safari. My daughter liked this one better for her 9-year-old sister."
1,Poor customer service,"Warning - this supplier does not respond to customer inquiries and does not send invoices so you can verify what you were charged. Bad business practice. Buyer beware. When Amazon was notified, they advised that they do not have processes in place to handle customer service complaints."
1,Are You Kidding Me?,"I'm hoping that this is a gag listing. $50 for a compilation of reviews posted by Amazon customers? The same reviews that are freely available on the product pages?If it is for real then this is the ultimate rip-off! Not only is it shocking to see freely posted reader reviews being sold, but for a price of $50! Complete disgrace; overwhelming greed.I wonder of the Amazon customers who wrote these reviews think of their works being a source of profit for others?"
5,just what I ordered,"These jeans are of excellent quality, heavy denim, no flaws, great fit, great price. I am very happy with them but the delivery was slow. (two weeks)"
1,Where's the peanuts????,This product should read Brittle with a couple of peanuts for looks. It also should be in a box to cut down on breakage. Very small pieces by the time it arrived in its plastic bag.
1,"brittle, but no peanuts","I got this in a giftbox. First, the box was big, but the product was small.Second, there were almost no peanuts in the brittle. So, it was essentially corn starch flavored brittle.Yuck!!!!"
2,Not very good,"First, it came as one big clump. I had to use a hammer to break it up.Not enough peanuts and it stuck (a lot) to my teeth.Not the best flavor either. Tolerable, but there are better choices."
5,Another Linda Kay Silva Page Turner,"Storm Rising is the latest in the Delta Stevens Mystery series and is by far the most exciting. Convinced that Delta is still alive after falling into the Caribbean from a helicopter, Connie Rivera, Meg Osbourne, Sal and Josh return to the Costa Rican rain forest to find and rescue her. They are joined by Gina, Connie's lover, Carducci, Delta's partner on the police force and Taylor, the jewel thief. The group experience many difficulties and you find yourself totally submerged in the book. I read the book in one day and was very sorry to get to the end. Don't this exceptional book."
1,McMansion Style,"If you like the newly built McMansion-styled homes, then this is the book for you. If you are looking for authentic French decor and tips, don't buy this book. This is no more ""unmistakably French"" than la Madeline food is to French cuisine."
2,Not Altman's best,"I'm a big Altman fan, and I was looking for something with his usual bite, but for some reason this film fell flat for me. Altman's usual star-studded cast re-enacts a fictional last performance of the well-known show, but it was just a bit too real to be satiric and a bit too silly to be real. Usually Altman films leave me feeling a shock of recognition--this is how life really is--messy, unfair, tragic but wonderful. ""Nashville"" (one of my all-time favorite films),""Short Cuts"" and ""The Player"" come to mind. Maybe this film just felt safe and a little boring--maybe there was just too much hokey music. Maybe you have to be a fan of PHC to enjoy it--I'm not. Disappointing!"
2,"Really not much, unless you are IN LOVE with the Radio Show","This had no plot, was missing the charm and whimsey of the Radio Show itself, and unless you like country music, then just don't bother, as most of the time is taken up with music. A shameful waste of talent all around. I was rather stunned at how disappointing this was. The best things about it were the comic deftness of Kevin Kline (funny almost no matter how trivial his material) the singing of Streep and Tomlin, and also Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly. Only Kline elicited any laughter at our showing. The audience seemed almost put to sleep... never a good thing. Absolutely none of the brilliant story-telling feel of Keillor in the script at all -- what the heck happened here? And where was Altman's famous ability to take you into the scene? A bit of a muddled mess."
1,BIG YAWN,"It must be me, I know that Robert Altman is a respected director, I know that Garrison Keillor is well loved for his humor and satire.I rented the movie thinking that it I couldn't go wrong with such an excellent cast and director.I couldn't finish watching it.It must be me."
5,Loved the movie!,Great movie and have shared it with many others! Nice to have a place where you can get old movies.
2,Waste of good talent...boring!,"I love radio shows. I love good acting. I love ensemble casts. In this case, I thought I'd lucked out, because all three were present. Two of my favorite actors of all time, Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep, are stars. Even they couldn't save this boring story. The emotional points in the story aren't touching enough because we've not been given enough time to love the characters. The goofy, funny elements could be heightened if we had more moments to view them, but instead they're cut off.In short, I couldn't wait for this movie to be over, which is an insulting comment but a true one."
5,It's like being an anthropologist and watching some strange tribe....m,Sending sparks up into the sky....What an amazing sendup--I'm just sad the movie had to end. I haven't laughed so hard in months.
2,I've had better,"While this brush mistly does the job, the bristles are so fine, yet hard that it is difficult to get the sauce to come off the brush and onto the food. I've tried the nylon/rubber ones at a friends house and they work much better. Not recommended."
1,"Tried it, but dropped after a few weeks.","Tried this product for several weeks. Was hoping it would help with high cholesterol and suspected hypo thyroid issues. Did feel a little warmer after taking it, but didn't affect body temp. A few weeks after starting it I developed shingles and decided to stop taking it. Coincidence? Maybe, but I've never had shingles before and since one of the side effects of guggul products is skin rash, was not convinced it didn't contribute to it. Wasn't on this product long enough to determine if it was helping with cholesterol or not. Not for me and would advise anyone who tries it to be cautious and alert for side-effects."
1,"EARTH, WIND & FIRE SHOULD SUE!","I thought this CD was a complete waste of time. The arrangements of classic EWF songs were ho-hum and boring.This was nothing but a ""vanity project"" for Sheldon Reynolds, a former member of Earth, Wind & Fire who joined the group after Al McKay and Johnny Graham left. The group had done their best work by then, so Sheldon never brought anything original to the table. I thought Larry Dunn (one of the original members) would have done more playing on this CD, seeing as how he contributed to the magic that once made EWF great. Sheldon limited Larry to playing on only a couple of tunes. That was a mistake. Please don't waste any money of this bulls**t. Invest your hard earned cash in purchasing the original Earth, Wind & Fire CDs."
1,Not as Good as the original,"This rendition of State Fair pales far in comparison to the original with Dana Andrews. The parents seem like they actually hate each other, and the mealy-mouth Margie has absolutely no chemistry with her beau. The only redeeming quality in this movie would have to be Pat Boone and Ann-Margret, they're cute together and A-M's version of ""Isn't Kinda Fun"" goes from stupid to steamy, and turns out kind of coo However, even these two don't compare with the originals. If you want to see State Fair, see the 1945 version."
4,"Wow, Ginger!","This tea is very strong on the ginger side. I don't taste all the lemon everyone is talking about (I love lemon!). Although it's not my favorite flavor, the tea is calming and does the trick. My favorite Celestial Seasoning's teas are peppermint and Sleepytime Extra with valerian. The echinacea one is very strong also, but a great quality. Love this company and their products!"
3,This book is OK for people who already understand the basics,"This book contains all of Weider's best principles. If you want to know some new things that can make your workout interesting. When you design your own workouts, don't use the ones the pros use until you have put on some lean muscle on a less strenuous program."
4,"Faces in the Smoke: An Eyewitness Experience of Voodoo, Shamanism, Psychic Healing, and Other Amazing Human Powers",A personal account of the ability of the mind to overcome our percieved physical limits.
1,passed it's prime,"the expiration date was up at the time i received these items. the tasted like vinegar. My Aunt use to bring it from New York and the date would last for a longggggg time. not happy for i bought 4 bottles.HP Brown Sauce England, 9-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)"
3,For Class,"There was nothing wrong with the book physically and it arrived on time. However, this book is boring and dated and does little to enhance comprehension of Spanish."
4,good for dragonball z fans,"It is taller than most action figures my son has, but he loves it and would bring it everywhere if I'd let him.... I don't get the Dragonball Z thing, but he was very excited to get this with his birthday money."
5,A Great Sequel,"Breggie James has done it again. This book puts closure to all the mysteries that came about in ""Sister Secrets"". I literally had to write down all the characters and their relationship to make sure I had everything straight. This book was a perfect example of how we need to know our past in order to avoid repeating it. James makes us realize that the Mother/Daughter bond is somehting special and should not be taken fro granted."
4,A bygone era,"Luckily, this 1965 book has the whiff of a bygone era. It is a comparative study of the political elites in major 20th century dictatorships. Concentrating on the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. It analyses the demographic makeup of the elites. Looking at, for instance, the occupations of the fathers of Politburo members, to get a sense of the social background that these members grew up in. Likewise with Nazi leaders.The authors try to find common patterns between these elites. In an attempt to understand how such movements successfully seize power. Plus also, no doubt, how the US might have to deal with them. Remember, too, when this book was written. An spoken undercurrent might have been how the US could prevent such revolutionary movements from taking power in the first place."
4,movie,Good movie - especially if you are a fan of kung-fu. Arrived in great condition. Very pleased. Thank you!
2,Motor burns out quickly not worth it.,"I originally bought this pump because with my older child I only had to pump occassionally, and it suited its purpose. When my second child arrived I had less time to nurse so, I decided to pump more often, with this pump it was impossible. It takes forever and the motor started to burn out after two weeks. I decided to purchase the new Avent pump, which works great."
3,No other option,"When I had my first child my employer didn't have a private place for me to pump. Since I refused to pump in the bathroom as everytime the toilet is flushed it sends bacteria and feces into the air, my only option was a battery operated pump. I bought it at BRU, and besides the noise and millions of batteries I went through it was okay. I didn't however pull enough of the milk out of my breast and I started to develop mastitis in both. I only recommend this item if you have no option buy to use battery operated devises, other wise, spend the money to buy a nice one, you'll send it eventually in batteries anyway."
3,Good at first.. then it lost me,"I bought the pump and started using it on March 20th. At first I was happy with the convience it gave me and the suction it had. In less than 30 days, the motor blew and lost suction.I am investing in a better Medela."
2,An interesting melange,"This series was not meant to be historically accurate.It is a melange of French historical characters, zombies, samurai and knights, therefore...a bunch of cultures. The entertainment is similar to The DaVinci Code: elaborate and confusing plot, mixing cultures and lots of adventure.Even with the confusing plots and unanswered questions, I feel that the creators made some fast make-ups at the end, which left me disappointed.Nice drawing quality and the English dubbing was great for an anime.I personally didn't enjoy paying so much for it but if you enjoy espionage, adventure, confusing plots, magic and multicultural and magical themes, you'll enjoy this."
4,Excellent!,I thought this book was very well written. It kept my attention as many don't. All-in-all a very good read.
2,Not For Kids -- Some off-color and adult jokes,"I purchased this book after others had said it's great for kids. My son loved it but came told me today that he was going to stop reading it b/c there are a lot of jokes are not appropriate for children. He's 11 yrs old. Other than that, the book is good -- just remember that it's not for kids."
4,Classic Shooter - Undeveloped Port,"I will be brief, FEAR is a classic PC shooter that does at great job at combining modern FPS mechanics with the horror genre. I found it genuinely scary and creepy and the story was very interesting to lean about. There are some bad parts, the last level in particular is frustrating, but its overall a great experience. The multiplayer is great but most likely dead, you can get ""FEAR Combat"", a free download for PC that is the full multiplayer game and is quite lively.Compared to most games this is a pretty visually lacking game on the 360. It should look better but it seems like it didnt get the proper funding it needed for a full fledged console port.Do not bother with FEAR Files, they are pretty bad and dont contribute much to the story."
4,FEAR is right,"I can see why it's called F.E.A.R.- you will be scared!It's strange how the music doesn't seem to be there, anywhere. I guess I can hear quiet notes in the background. Trying to control the character is pretty easy, except when it comes to aiming at certain things. This is when a problem will be presented.I love all the gunfire that takes place. The action looks really good and the way the guns fire constantly really makes a believer out of me that this game is the REAL deal. I want you to buy this game. This game was just a magnificent experience."
4,Scary!!,"It had me jumping out of my seat a few times. The online is lacking along with the storyline. I'm still not sure what happen at the end. However, the game play is fun and the graphics amazing."
3,Special Forces?!,"First Encounter Assault Recon (F.E.A.R.) ""special forces"" seem to have a limitless budget for Black Hawk helicopters. They never land, they always crash. Yet, they can't equip you with a decent night vision goggle(NVG) to do your night fighting in. Just a white flashlight that gives away your position as you are doing your ""special forces"" operations. The flashlight must be one of those ""shake and use"" kind, since it's always running out of juice but strangly recharging itself when it's off. I liked fighting the cloaked monkey ninjas best."
5,What a game!,"I have been looking forward to this game ever since it came out on PC, and this game is everything and more on the 360. Great action, graphics, pace and horror. It's freaky walking around in the dark and hearing the little demon girl whispering to you, or seeing her shadow run behind you. This game is going to be a classic."
4,Not as good as the others,"The first book in this series had me laughing so hard I was crying. The second one was just as bad (or good), but by the time I got to this book, the humor was getting a bit old. That's not to say it was bad. This book was very funny, and I'd recommend it to anyone who liked the series. It just wasn't as good as the others. (Anguished English, More Anguished English)"
5,Comfort for the Journey,"I have been on a spiritual journey for many years, always feeling terrible for doubting what I have believed from childhood about my faith. This book comforted me by letting me know that questioning is an essential part of becoming spiritually mature, an essential part of being fully human and living life ""to the full"". I highly recommend this book especially for women who recognize that they are on a spiritual journey."
2,Disappointed,"This is a one hour long documentary that friviously combines homosexuality with totalitarian propaganda. Cannot be compared to ""Strawberries and chocolate"""
2,NOT IMPRESSED,"I have this (unfortunate?) habit of having to finish anything I start. And I cannot believe i reached the end of this book. The crime was far from ""perfect""...it was so convoluted and contrived, I'm not sure if the focus of the author was devising a murder or creating an obscene number of inane mental ramblings, as Roger tries to logicalize everything in his mind. His constant, obsessive strategizing gets very tiresome and is not intriguing in the least. I'm currently reading a Dean Koontz novel, and it's making my heart palpitate - that's what a great suspense book does! Peter Abrahams has not impressed me at all. And with a pathetic ending to boot...save your cash."
3,A PERFECT FAUXPAUX,"The way I see it, the genius with the 181 IQ(on a bad day), was actually the village idiot, and the only really good person in the book was unjustly treated.This is one of those books that I finished because I always finish books I start. This book is nothing more than a case of double and triple crosses. The bad guys are really stupid and the good ones are clueless. This is not an exciting book, but is okay if there is nothing else around."
1,Disappointing! A waste of time! Thrownout money!,Forget this book. Too many coincidences to make this plot intricate or thrilling!
3,Not so perfect,"I naively acquired this book believing that the plot actually could be close to the perfect crime. There were far too many holes and events left to chance to make it even close to a perfect crime.Once I got past that mental block, the book was fun to read. It happened to take on more realism for me since I started it at Logan airport in November.I did like the insight into the minds of such diverse characters--everyone from a mentally off-kilter rapist/killer to a snooty professional with an IQ off the charts.It's well worth the read--just don't expect too much!"
1,Buyer Beware,"I've gone through two Polaroid DVD players -- both of them lasted only days after the warranty expired (just a couple months!!) They wanted almost the original purchase price to send me a ""refurbished"" one! We were not abusive in any way to these players -- I will never purchase another Polaroid product if I can help it."
2,Broken casters due to poor packaging,The packaging for this product was very poor in two shipments. In each shipment the casters on the unit at the bottom were broken. The product itself would deserve 4 stars for quality. Order one more than you need and return the damaged unit.
3,Could have been better...,"Although the product looked good for the most part, there were MANY nicks, dings and chips all along the sides and top of the box. It would be too much of a hassle to attempt a return. Lucky for me the person who I gave it to didn't care too much about the chips. I doubt I will ever buy anything like this online again."
2,Disappointed !,"I was disappointed when I saw the armoire in person. It's not nearly as pretty as in the picture. It's actually rather dull. I must admit I was influenced by the rave reviews of others. The quality was lacking, I believe it is overpriced. I was sorely disappointed.S.D."
3,Forget Everything About Roses,"Every album Ian Brown puts out, whether with the Roses or solo, is significantly different from the other, although they follow a logical evolutionary path. Brown has covered a lot of ground, from the sugar coated pop of the Stone Roses debut, the rock of the Second Coming, the experimentation of Unfinished Monkey Business, the beats driven Golden Greats, and now the ambient chill-out minimalism of Music of the Spheres. Only the Beatles covered more ground. Although it is not as accessible as the Roses material or the classic Golden Greats, it boasts two great tracks in F.E.A.R. and El Mundo Pequeno, and works well as a coherent album (despite there being the odd dud track). It is an excellent 3am album, and serves as a strong stepping stone to wherever he decides to take his music next."
3,Good but not great,"Stop Loss tried hard to get the emotional impact of fighting in Iraq right, and I think they succeeded in that. Where the movie falls down is when the soldiers get back to Texas, and are being phased out of the Army. That crucial part of the movie did not ring true, nor did the ending, which I won't give away. I can't believe the Army would be so cavalier as to have a low level clerk tell a decorated non-com they are being stop lossed. That news should have been delivered by the platoon leader. But I could be wrong - maybe the Army is that cold blooded. Other than that, this movie was solid although it could have done without the requisite bar scenes, and the movie lost continuity when it shifted twice during critical scenes back to the secondary stories of those who were not impacted by the stop loss. Too bad this movie didn't get wider play -it is an indictment of the Bush Administration trying to keep up our troop level committments without resorting to a draft."
4,terrific read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Michael Wallis has a very nice writing style, and great approach to the subject matter. I think the state of Oklahoma should erect a statue in the state capitol in his honor, for writing such a nice piece of work about the state. There are some really nice rememberances, and some very tragic tales found between the covers of this book. I would reccomend it to any reader interested in knowing more about Americas heartland, and the people who built it, and live there today."
2,Not better than my GeForce 3 Ti 200,"I bought this card hoping to extend the life of my Dell Dimension 8100, by replacing my GeForce 3 Ti 200 video card.Although the installation went flawlessly, the performance of the new card lagged behind enough that I went back to my original card.Frame rates are significantly lower and it benchmarked well less as well.I'm not inmpressed."
1,Did not fit,Even though the manufacturer said they would fit my F250 crew cab they did not. Amazon made it easy to return them.
2,Terrible quality,"2 stars... all for the movie. One of my favorite films, but this transfer is awful.I had a VHS recording from analog cable... and the transfer was better than this.The picture is overly soft and the colors and whites are dull.I can't recommend the transfer, but the movie is still fun."
4,"Very fine effort from Carradine and Stockard Channing, but for crying out loud, it's not an Actioner, it's a comedy!","Many tongue-in-cheek contestants in TransAfrican 3000 mile race (long since discon-tinued) with cars supported by differentcompanies/countries. Check out the frenchdriveers dialogue! Channing supposedly worksfor Playboy! Director Harry Hurwitz getscameo. Longshot style of filming suits thisfilm well. Wildlife is very good in here aswell. Cna you belevie that kooky HamiltonCamp is Colleen's (Smokey and the Bandit 3)father? Christopher Lee has also done filmswith Carradine's father, John. Funny andnot to be taken too seriously!"
3,"music, science and sex","Weird and wonderful, if somewhat confused. Just when he starts to make sense the author heads off on a tangent about the Catholic Church or some such bugaboo, and you loose confidence. The mass of facts, calculations, esoteric formulas and mathematical problems made my head hurt. But if you can get through all that and keep the basic message in mind, it is well worth reading from a musical point of view. I don't know how a scientist would judge it. The basic message is: everything connects."
3,INTELLIGENT,"This guy is really smart. He has alot of equations that are above my head, but they are in the book to qualify what he is saying. I enjoyed alot of the things he said, they helped me clarify some things I've been looking into. I did not get this book for his theory of theology or spiritual guidance. I got it for the science and knowledge of music and how it is in all creation. As far as I'm concerned he could have left some of his opinions out. But I'm glad I bought the book."
5,Kickbox video,"Love this workout. It is great for when you don't have a lot of time for a workout, or you can do two for a better workout. I like the way Shelly and the other girls cut up with eachother and seem to have a good time."
5,Princess In Love,It is one of the best teen books I have ever read. All of it wsa so Amazing! I loved it!
2,This is a Book?,This story does not give the talents of Meg Cabot full credit. Good for a few laughs but you may get more out of a chat session.
3,"Ok, but not as much fun as ""Boy Next Door""","I was really looking forward to this book, even kept stopping by the bookstore to see if they had gotten it in yet. Unfortunately, it wasn't as enjoyable as the first.I felt that Kate and Mitch were exactly the same as Mel and John from the first book. They acted the same and thought the same... almost to the point where I felt like if you did a find/replace for Kate/Mel and Mitch/John, I wouldn't have noticed. I just wish they had been more distinctive characters. Just changing their professions and physical characteristics isn't enough. [In some ways (Kate's journaling, their internal dialog), Kate/Mel's voice is also very similar to Mia's (Princess diaries) voice as well.]On the positive side, I enjoyed seeing Stacy's family and more of life at the New York Journal. Cute plot, but as I was reading I felt like I had already ""been there, done that"".I would recommend it as more of a library book than an addition to your bookshelf."
2,ANNOYING FORMAT..,"I could not even get to page 100. This format of reading only emails,text messages, and voicemails may be unique but it is extremely irritating. The heroine also seemed too annoying. Not too many would date a non-committing rock star/loser for 10 years."
5,Absolutely hysterical!!!,"I was a bit leary about this book and the format it was written, but I have to say it pulled me in from the very first page. It was so funny, I found myself laughing out loud on so many occasions. I also work in a law firm so the jabs at the lawyers made it even better (I completely understood what they were talking about!). It's a quick read, but definitely worth it! My only complaint with the book is that we didn't get more details on Mitch & Kate - I would have liked for them to have spent more time together. Oh well, I guess I need to get the next book to see how they are doing."
4,A Sense Of Place,"Instantly,the characters in this author's first novel come alive and lets the reader know exactly where they are. The sense of place and locale grows on you as you read on and on. Barrels of humor and well placed touches of romance and tragedy decorate the pages. One has to think of greater and more successful writers when reading this. Writers like Faulkner, Welty, Morrisson, and Erdrich mastered this same sense of place that McNichols entertains. Right at the time when the reader should be comfortable with a sense of place, Jan comes in. Now the reader is not so comfortable. Yet still, the sense of place dictates. A wonderful offering as a first novel."
2,Too basic to be useful for those in dire need,"This book was easy to read yet the information was too basic and not very helpful for someone who has done much reasearch and is truly searching for a different solution. Also, there are sections that contradict each other, such as, technology and learning to use it create stress and should be avoided, yet, she advises on changing over to electronic billing to eliminate mail. Overall, there were approximately two pages worth of useful advice. This book was a compilation of very basic information; almost anyone could have written this book."
4,Cobra round fire pit with screen,"We have enjoyed the fire pit and use it nearly every evening to burn wood scraps. It is durable and has not blown away during some fierce winds. However, do not use the screen/cover with a fire as it will melt. For the price, it's a good deal. Can't expect $1000 dollar quality for $150. Would have been nice to know dimensions and weight before ordering; I had to go to an another site to get the info."
3,Good for a native English speaker,Interesting and complete: a book on English Grammar for curious native speaker.If you are a foreign learner it's definitely not the best.
4,Good explanation of the concept of strategy,"My takeaway from this article is that strategy should be described as a series of many linked activities that are not only aligned but also re-inforce each other so that 1+1=3. A competitor may easily copy some activities but it is harder to successfully copy every activity. Since the success of the execution relies on 1) many activities working in concert, 2) refraining from doing non-strategic activities, the biggest threat to executing the strategy is coming from within the organization as opposed to any external competition.Well explained. Makes sense. However, I was less impressed by the actual examples given. In fact, I read this article a couple of months ago and I cannot remember a single example."
5,Great quality,Good quality - two toned - pretty and thicker material than regular folders. I would recommend this product. Thanks. Bye.
1,Overrated and Ugly,"Are you a novice planning on learning 3d software? Are you used to consistency in interfaces? Then don't buy this software. The interface is illogical, difficult and slow to learn. It breaks many common sense ideas/rules about software generally, (why put several functions at the bottom of the screen for example?). Be prepared for a huge learning curve here, even if this is the top end of 3d software it still is in my opinion poorly designed."
4,Tastes terrible but works miracles.,"This, being a pill full of green things, was not something that I expected to taste magnificent. But again, being a pill, it spends so little time in the tasting arena that it's a negligible aspect when considering this product. When taken in full dose, it keeps me full until I can get an actual meal in me, which is great when I'm at work and 9:45 rolls around with no lunch in sight. I'm sure the benefits to my body are great too, I'm just no scientist so I can't quantify that for you in an Amazon review."
5,Great Book,This book is very thorough and helpful for anyone who wants to use the Check Point product line. I recommend this book as it is detailed and info packed. The appendix written by Dan Kaminski who is world renowned in his security work is also a great read. This book is also a great prep for the CCSA NG exam 156-210. I would recommend this book to anyone who wanted to learn how to configure and use Check Point as well as to get more information on security in general. Good Stuff!
5,It helps me sleep at night,"I recently realized that Perfect Food was hleping me sleep at night because when I ran out of it, and had to wait a couple weeks before I got more, and realized that I was lying awake at night for hours at a time. Once I got the Perfect Food and began using it again each morning, I began sleeping at night even the same day. I think it has lots of good stuff that we need in our diet that we don't get, even in a healthy diet."
2,"Hey, WAIT A MINUTE!","Tom Jones ain't supposed to be having any business doing dance remixes in his old age. He did a duet with Sarah Brightman in 1995, namely ""Something In The Air,"" featured on her Fly CD, and he was supposed to have gotten it on with Bocelli, Aretha, Sting, and Enrique Iglesias last year, but ended up teaming up with the latter two on VH1's Men Strike Back. It's bad enough we had to go through hell listening to the aging Cher's ""Believe"" blasted in radio a thousand times over. I still fondly remember ""What's New Pussycat?"" That's about it."
1,Trim Rear Hinge Cover,This item did not include all the accessories even though it cost a lot of money. The cover for the window handle the cover for the 4 Glass plugs are all missing don't know if it was an error but this to me is a complete set.
1,Terrible,This book is outrageously overpriced. The book is elementary with little or no valuable information for a professional manager or trainer. Amazon should refund money to all that bought it!!!
3,Cellulean Treatment,I have noticed an improvement in my skin. I will continue to use this product and give you an update as time goes on.
3,Don't bother; it is not worth the Time,"At first, the deaths thought to be insignificant. Then a pattern is recognized. Someone is killing the top Russian specialists in every Western intelligence agency--England's MI6, Germany's BND, France's DGSE and our CIA.A special virus, Hydra constructed directly with the intended victim's DNA, is the cause. Throw in a few disgruntled Soviet dinosaurs who want to return Russia to its Communist glory days and you have the foundation for a clichéd, predictable tale.I finished it, but found myself wishing I had left this book on the library shelf."
3,Different Writing Styles,The Covert-One Series is a fantastic series that unfortunately is written by multiple people with different writing styles. I found the Moscow Vector to be a little slower than the other books in this series. That being said it is well-written and a good ride even if some of the scenes are completely implausible and unbelievable.
3,"good, but not as good","comparing to other covert one series, this book is not as wildly known. i personally love the covert one series very much, but i just couldn't finish this one. the story is much slower than other covert one books. as of today, i am still trying to make myself pick up this book to read."
5,All about salt,"What would you like to know about salt? You can most likly learn all (...)On the morton [site] you can read up on all the different uses for salt, for cleaning, your feet, your throat and so on. Beyond that, I will add my opinion. Morton was a well trusted product long before I was born. When I was a kid they use to really promote the anti clumping agent in the salt, so it poured when it rained. From what little I know about geology, salt has in some cases been around for millions of years. But mineral deposits in some area are more pure then in other area. We know we can trust Morton to give us the cleanest, purest product available. Even when the company is bought and sold, they still seem to maintain their high standard of excellance. Everyone needs salt, but we should also be careful not to over due our salt intake."
5,Packed full of easiy to use graphic power!,"I have a hard time learning new computer programs. (i.e Adobe illustrator) Corel Draw 11 took me about 4 days to master with the help of Corel Draw's oOficial Guide. This program rocks! I am not a pro graphics person i just wanted a way to take designs in my head and put them to paper. Corel draw easily does this for me with all there tools. The layout of this program is amazing. Real easiy to use without skimping on powerful graphis tools.Along with corel draws graphics suite comes rave and photo-paint. I'll admit there not as powerful as Flash or photoshop, but their a lot easier to learn. Making flash movies is very intertaining and photo-paint has some cool effects.All the programs in this suite also have tutorials to help you learn quickly. And designer.com is packed full of even more tutorials. If you're a new to computer graphic's or a pro thinking about switching from Adobe illustrator Corel Draw is for you. Value, Value and even more Value!"
4,Value for money graphics suite,"...Bottom Line.I would recommend this suite to anyone. It has a nice feel, and the documentation is easy to follow. It is not a simple program, but with a bit of time it can be learned by most users. If you are planning on becoming a professional, then this is a good place to start. You will achieve most, if not all of your goals without having to pay for extra programs, books etc, and the learning curve is not too steep, although it is not a toy either."
1,Macintosh version useless,"I bought this to work on some files created by a colleague with a PC. This is the slowest, buggiest, most confusing program I have every used. It takes about 3 minutes to load the file (on the PC, only seconds). It takes 30 seconds to save it. It takes probably 15 seconds to redraw every time anything is moved or changed. I tried to export to illustrator so I could get something done, but gave up after Corel had created a 180 MB file (from a 3 MB original) and was still cranking away. It crashed upon trying to create a PICT file.The user interface is confusing. I can't seem to do the simplest things, like find colors in the pallettes. The text editing is awkward. This is exactly the sort of program one gets after a version 11: bloated feature-itis and a counter-intuitive interface.For the Mac, at least, this was a complete waste of money."
2,Retro Candy,"Cute idea,but box arrived creased, and some of the candy stale. Did not live up to it's promise for the price. This was a birthday gift for my husband."
4,Nice lookin case.,"I got this case for my iPod and I'm pretty pleased with it. It looks sharp and fully protects my iPod from getting scratched or scuffed and though I haven't put it to the test yet I'm sure it would reduce any damage from a fall. It has a nice screen shield and a plastic covering over the circle selector thingy. The circle selector still works great, very sensitive to touch. Easy access to the hold switch and no problem with plugging in my various headphones. The only complaint I had was I couldn't plug in my iMuff link into the bottom of the iPod. The opening in the case was a just a bit too small. I got a lil grinding tool and shaved a bit off and it works fine now though. I recommend this case, it's a quality product, just be prepared to do a lil tweaking if you have iMuffs."
3,good,"it looks great - sleek, not bulky. just wish the material was a little sturdier. it's plasticky."
2,Very Short Battery Life,"No mouse should require new batteries every week, if you want wireless buy a Logitech cordless non optical, the batteries last on average 4-5 months."
2,"Great mouse, BUT TOO MANY FLAWS","Oh where to begin, i have used this thing for close to two weeks now and i dont seem to overlook the flaws. Let me start off with the pros.PROS:1. Wireless2. Responsive more than other wireless mice3. GREAT placement of thumb and back buttonCONS:1. Not as responsive as wired mice2. Not accurate, when you move your mouse, it sort of jumps rather than scroll from its original point.3. Does not move smoothly, this is because of the bottom corners sticking.4. Goes to sleep mode every so often.To sum everything up, get this mouse if its just for internet browsing. If for gaming or photoshop, this mouse would not be what youre looking for."
3,A nice mouse with one or two glitches,"I feel pretty lucky compared to other people who reviewed this mouse. I like it a lot except for one or two minor problems.This mouse feels much better in my hand than any other mouse I have tried so far. And I like the feel of the wheel also.So far I have not had to replace the batteries but it has only been one week.My main complaint is that sometimes you spin the mouse wheel and the screen does not move. I have two of these mice and the both do it, on two separate PCs. So it is definitely a design issue with these mice.I find that to be very annoying. But if you can get past that, it is a nice mouse."
3,"Nice ergonomics, poor battery life",I have the MS wireless mouse at work. I use it for typical desktop work (no gaming). The mouse is wonderfully ergonomic. However I have to change the batteries about every 3-5 weeks. That's just too often for me. I think I'll just go with a wired optical. The optical mice are far superior.
1,"Garbage, utter garbage","I guess I should have realized that this mouse was going to be a piece of garbage when because the IntelliPoint 4.1 software wouldn't install, and MS Knowledge Database had me hacking the registry and deleting system files. Worst of all, after all of this trouble to get the software installed, the mouse worked fine - albeit a little sloppy on the tracking - until the first reboot. Windows now sees it only as an unknown USB device, despite several reinstalls, and connection attempts."
2,"Nice feel, terrible control.","This mouse was trouble for me almost from the very start. First of all, it eats batteries like crazy. Two weeks per pair of good quality alkalines was about average. It did see a lot of usage during that time which put extra strain on the battery life, but they should have lasted much longer. Second, it was very skippy and uneven when moved. The mouse jumped during every movement, even on slow moves on a high contrasting surface. Third, it sometimes took a second or two before it would even respond to my movements. I found the combination these things intolerable and gave it away. It has been passed on at least twice since then. The unfortunate thing is that the mouse has a VERY nice feel in it's shape and buttons. I really liked that feel above any other mouse I've used. But sadly, that was nowhere near enough compensation for the huge drawbacks of it's operation."
3,Disappointing,"This mouse is not good in the precision department. It has ergonomic physical design, but it is unergonomic when you are trying hard to position the cursor for text editing.The only thing this mouse is good for is surfing the web.For text editing, programming, gaming, etc. I don't think this is a productive tool. You will stress yourself out trying to get the cursor positioned right.Get the corded version, there is an unbelievable difference in performance."
2,...,I bought this thing and it seems to work fine 90% of the time. But occasionally it gets lost and you gotta do annoying swirlies just to get it back again. Unless you're crazy and hate cords just get one with a cord. Wireless is cool but it still ...
1,No Longer WORKING!!,"I wrote a review on this item 2 months ago and i had originally gave it 2 stars, but now i would have to give it just 1 star. After two months of using it under normal conditions, it finally broke down. Such a shame because i was only starting to get use to the on again off again battery saving feature that made me lag in games. So for an item that is no longer working after 2 months, i would not recemmend this to anyone. I'm sorry Microsoft but you dropped the ball on this one."
1,Stick to Software,"This mouse has a nice feel to it, for about 5 minutes then you'll most likely notice a tiny pain in your pinky finger. This may not be the case for everyone but my hands are a little larger than most and when using this mouse it tends to drag my pinky around after it. I have both this mouse and the Cordless Mouseman Optical by Logitech, and I would say by far the Logitech mouse is better buy. It may have one less button but also has a smaller price tag. Please save your money and don't make the same mistake that I did."
1,"What a waste of money! If you're smart, you'll venture on.","I received this mouse as a gift, and it was nothing but a pain. I've used all different kinds, but this mouse was by far the worst. The lag time to get it back up and running is awful, and I found that if there was any dust whatsoever on the underside, the dang thing wouldn't work until it was completely clean! The only plus side I could even remotely give this mouse is that it is larger, so it would be accommodating for those with slightly larger hands. Unless you feel like cleaning it (and I mean thoroughly) before every use, it's not worth it.Note: after I got rid of this mouse, I went to Logitech duos and have not had a problem since."
1,"review of the ""DVD set"" itself, not the show","Like the majority of reviewers, the show itself is great. Of course, we all know this, as it's the impetus for most that buy the ""little house"" collection. I gave it such a low rating chiefly b/c of the VERY poor quality. It appears, to me, like they took a vhs copy and viewed it many, many times so you get the ""multiple watching defects"" that one would get from a vhs tape and THEN transferred it to DVD. Really, I think it would be better (quality-wise) for the consumer to return the DVD set and just tape it from re-runs on television. Or, better yet, not purchase it AT ALL and then tape it from tv re-runs.One personal opinion and/or suggestion to reviewer ""Kim Possible Finicatata ""Jen"""". The objective of a review is, generally, a review of the ITEM, not an editorial of your personal life. Possibly you should keep that in mind in the future?"
3,Working pritty good.,Good PC for the price. I did have some problems with my HP All-In-One but that is more likely Vista.
5,Great product - Vista isn't so bad,"Have been using this for 8 months now. HP makes a great machine. Would purchase again if I had to do it over. The TV tuner is awesome, the machine is fast and I haven't noticed any of the crashes or lags that so many Vista users complain about...perhaps that's b/c Microsoft has put out the 1st Service Pack for Vista or perhaps the complainers weren't using a proper hardware configuration (i.e. not enough RAM or Video memory)."
2,This is fluff,"Seriously, it's not that I am cynical, it's more a matter that this book will not really do anything for your average teacher.Yes, getting in front of an audience each day is difficult. That is why I think you need to become more of an actor than a courageous classroom warrior.Most of this book seems like it was written by a person in an ""Ivory Tower"". They seem truly disconnected from reality and seem to have no clue to what the real challenges of the classroom bring each day.I don't know, read it if you want, it seem like others thought highly of this book. If you got something out of it, good for you. When I read it, I was in college, and thought it was interesting. Now that I am in the real world, I have to chuckle at most of the nonsensical fluff in this book."
3,Points to Ponder,"I was not enchanted or spiritually lifted after I had read this highly-praised book. It was too much talk with little background. I love stories that empower, or motivate, where as that was what I was expecting with this book and was sadly disappointed. It scared me more to become a teacher (with it's sherr negativity) and failed to make me fel the need to explore my inner landscape."
2,Not typical style,"I have heard many speak highly of the book, but I just don't get it. There is passion in his style and his delivery encouraging teachers to maintain integrity, to stay true to themselves, and so forth. I guess that I lose interest due to the verbose language used. There are many aspects to teaching, and it is a lot of work; I am not equating this aspect to success or failure for connection with the students. As I said, many that I have spoken to enjoy it... I don't."
3,"The book was insightful, but the writing was overdone.",I am a college student majoring in the field of education. I read The Courage To Teach to fulfill an assignment. I found Palmer's theories on teaching from the innerself to be honest and insightful. His ideas on educational reform strike true particularly in light of all the failed attempts at reform. I found the downside of the book to be Palmer's writing style. The complexity of his writing made the reading so tedious that it took away from what could have been an enjoyable and eye-opening discovery for teachers at any stage in their careers.
2,Overrated,"Attempting to establish the thesis that ""good teaching comes from good people,"" Palmer overstates his case by downplaying the importance of expertise and technique. For example, he claims that teachers' knowledge of their subjects is ""always flawed and partial"" and that a command of content ""always eludes [their] grasp."" His overuse of the word soul makes it sound like only a ""good person"" can be a good teacher. This seems to be a shaky (or even simplistic) assumption on which to base a book.Ironically, the most effective parts of the book are those in which he discusses techniques for improving teaching, especially the focus on ""critical moments"" and ""subject-centered classrooms."" I agree with his points on ""the grace of great things,"" though the pious tone is bothersome, especially when he refers to teaching as ""life-giving communion with the young."" The second half of the book is much better than the first half, but it still is a tough read for anyone with a postmodernist sensibility."
2,Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Good monitor... except, sometimes it buzzes like some sort of humming bird on crack. That's incredibly annoying and surprisingly loud. Doesn't do it all the time, but I certainly believe the other reviewer that says his buzzes all the time."
5,Perils of Paradise,"This is highly recommended reading as Ms. Beamish is a superb writer! The author's narration of these riveting experiences keeps one glued, page-by-page, and her descriptions make it easy for one to feel each victim's emotions! Photo at the end of each chapter is a real nice touch, too."
5,entertaining,"Always a pleasure to read a Judith Michael book.I like the fact that it's written by a couple; you getboth a woman and a man's perspective.The Sybille character is evil but the other two, Valerieand Nick, aren't perfect either. It gives the reader theopportunity to make it's own mind on wether they willlike these people or not. This option is not dictatedto us by the authors."
3,Samsung 151P @ Bytesector.com,"The Samsung SyncMaster line of monitors have been reliable and made for the high end user. Once again, Samsung has not disappointed the consumers. The SyncMaster 151P is an LCD monitor that delivers sharp and brilliant colors to the user. There are very few LCD monitors that look as good off as they do on. The 151P was expertly designed by F.A. Porsche making it a sight for sore eyes anytime. Being an LCD monitor the 151P has a small footprint and takes up no more depth than the stand that supports it. This is really handy to anyone who has a messy desk and realizes that there is just no way that the CRT in front of them belongs there. The 151P comes with support and cables for both digital and analog input, but when using one of the two the other cable must hang behind the monitor making it a nuisance to move around. (full review @ bytesector.com)"
2,Am I really benefitting?,"Its anyone's guess whether Im throwing my money away or actually benefitting from these vitamins. They are a bit large, but shouldnt be a problem if you have swallowed pills before. You can cut them in half if they pose a problem, but swallow them quickly because the taste isnt too pleasant. People seem to trust the claims of centrum and other vitamin makers, so I hope that its money well spent. In honesty, I feel it changes the color of my urine, but probably doesnt provide my body with all the vitamins it claims. I dont think the body can really handle all of them in a magic pill. Who knows? Not me..."
1,Upsets stomach even if taken after meals,"Each time me and my husband take Centrum (the NEW formula), we always get a very bad stomach ache which stays for an hour or so. The previous formulation of the Centrum multivitamins,seemed to be okay. I have switched to a different brand, because the stomach pain can be quite severe at times."
3,Decent but not great.........,"The book read like a play. It lacked rhythm. It lacked passion. It was a pretty good story, but the absence of rythmic flow took away from the content."
2,Not her best work,"I usually devour Saray Mlynowski's books in a matter of days, but it took me several weeks to plod through this one. If not for a compulsion to finish any book I start reading, I probably would have set this one aside about mid-way through. It has a promising premise, but I felt the lead character just wasn't likeable enough, so I couldn't stick with her point of view as fame goes to her head. The author interrupts the story from time to time with an outside observer who watches Sunny's show, and I think the whole thing would have played better if the narrative wasn't in the first person."
2,Disappointment from Mlynowski,"I'm a huge fan of Sarah Mlynowski and loved ""Milkrun"" and ""Fishbowl"" (which I HIGHLY recommend!) I was awaiting her next book, ""As Seen On TV"", and so looking forward to it that I preordered it months in advance. What a huge disappointment. This was not up to par with the Mlynowski quality I'm used to reading. The plot was amateur and was something I would expect of a novice chick lit writer, but definitely not the calibre I was anticipating. I would not recommend ""As Seen On TV"", but definitely pick up her other 2! Now those are great reads."
2,Not great,"Not have read any thing from Sarah Mlynowski, I was not sure what expect from ""As Seen on TV."" Sunny Langstein is a twenty something that moves from Florida to New York City to be with her boyfriend, after a job falls though, Sunny ends up on Party Girls a new reality show. Quickly, Sunny goes from a character that the reader likes to a self-center woman who more interested in the lastest fashions than the fact that her boyfriend and others are falling the way-side.Other reviewers, said that this was not Ms. Mlynowski best, well I was not that impressed with ""As Seen on TV."""
5,Baby smooth skin!,"My feet feel happy after using the Denco foot smoother. It gets rid of rough and dead skin & reduces calluses. Use once a week and you will be very satisfied with the results. This device is often used when you get a professional pedicure, so why not treat yourself at home?!"
3,like all the others,"Its not a bad product, but its no better than any other foot file. I guess I will keep looking."
5,No more scratchy heels!,"Like another reviewer mentioned, my scratchy heels would always make snagging sounds on my silky duvet cover. Not any more! I was so excited to try this after I received it! I have used it on dry feet and slightly damp feet, and it works both ways. I just use it while I sit on the edge of the tub and then I rinse the dead skin mess down with some water when I am done. I have rubbed very aggressively, and I never have any discomfort afterwards...just smooth skin! I loved it so much that I recommended it to my sister! Definitely worth the $!"
1,Did nothing to my feet,"Did nothing to my feet. Not coarse, does not scrub at all. Waist of money. That is just foil with holes in it."
3,Pretty good,"This does a good job removing your callius but due to the shape the metal file tends to dip a little. So with the design of the file having the plastic edges around it, it makes it awkward to use in some angles, because the plastic prevents the file from touching your skin,"
3,Nice Product,It is okey product. Nothing so impressive. I used it with the callus remover solution but it took a lot longer to remove callus than anticipated.
1,Wrong Item,I bought the 563411 visors for my 2003 F150 Extended Cab because the site said they would fit. They don't. They are for a Ford Super-Duty not an F150. They are way too big.
1,"works ok, but tooooo overpriced","if i remember correctly, i paid way too much for it. it was hard to peel, but works fine."
1,"Pain, Pain, and More Pain","I assume you're buying this book becasue you are taking Secured Transactions. I'm sorry. This book is bad. All of the cases deal with old 9 not revised 9 which is usually the current law. You'll read a case- understand it and then they'll say it all changed when they passed revised 9. Prepare to be confused. If you are a professor please be kind, don't force your students to use this book. Any other book has to be better."
2,Only half work,This container set comes with 2 sizes. The larger size works real well but the smaller container's lids will not fit. Out of the 8 smaller containers I can only fit the lid on 1 and that one I would have to keep together because another lid won't work on it.I was even going to force them on and then put them into the dishwasher on the dry cycle to steam and dry them to mold them but it didn't matter how I chased that lids around the container the lid was to big.I contacted the manufacture and they sent me out another complete set but they do the same thing.Since the larger lids fit fine you would think they could get the others to fit also.I wouldn't think I'm the first one to complain about this.
5,Great!,"There are spoilers in people's reviews below mine... aparently some people just don't mind ruining it for you. A dub IS coming out. This has some nudity. 13+. Ok, these are the ONLY EPISODES OF PRINCESS ROUGE! THERE ARE NO MORE, YET... NOT IN AMERICA OR JAPAN."
1,Order Canceled --Contacted Them Twice--Never Told Why,"I have ordered this product before from WEB VITAMINS without issue.Suddenly, there was something 'wrong' with my order information. I was surprised, as I have been a customer for quite some time and have not made any changes. I have always been satisfied with their products and service, so I expected a swift resolution, especially since Amazon sent an email telling me that my order would be canceled if the problem wasn't fixed.I was wrong! After 2 emails asking for clarification and no response, (and then my order being canceled) I am chalking this one up to bad customer service."
4,Comic Bliss!!!,This is the comic you should be reading. All 10 volumes are brilliant.One as good or better than the next.Pick it up you won't be disappointed.
2,Not worth the money,"It was a book I wanted. I bought it at the high price. When I got it there is so much type written words where you would expect more pictures. Also the pictures are done in Black and White. Where the ruins blend in and you cannot really see them. Also many of the pictures look the same but say different ruins. So, less type and more color pictures or a better photographer.Not worth the money!!!!"
4,Great CD,"Jaci Velasquez makes this a great CD with the energy she puts into her songs. It is the same in her concert I saw. If I could change anything, I would use more latin percussion and less drum machine. I am partial. Con Tu Amor almost makes it to Cuba a couple of times, but never gets there. I guess Houston is as far south as this CD gets. Junto A Mi is very energetic. It makes you long for Tito Puente to break in with a solo, but this never happens. I know the percussionist in her band could do it, but he doesn't. That is really the only dissapointment I have with the CD. Jaci Velasquez is a more dynamic singer than I here in the Latin music here. That is why putting her in front of a latin band that is really cookin is such a good idea. Maybe Sony will rerelease some of her songs done up that way. It's a GREAT CD, I be waiting for the next one."
1,dissapointment,"I have been a fan of Jaci Velasquez from the beginning, hugely because of the message of the songs, this Spanish translation is a total dissapointment. The songs translate into totally secular songs and the message of Christ is lost. I hope she realizes this and returns to recording music that praises God, not man."
2,3 activities with 1001 variations,"Essentially, this is a book for people with little-to-no experience with group games or team building. All of the activities listed were ones I already knew, and the large number in the title comes from the number of variations for each of 3 activities: building things out of everyday items (see how high you can build a tower with the given items), common physical challenges (get the group from one side of the room to another using various props), and improv/word games. If you have a small imagination and very limited knowlegde of common team building activities, you might like this book, but if you're already in the field and looking for a book of new ideas, keep on looking. This isn't it."
4,Wonderful resource!,"My school has found this book to be very useful in helping our K-4 students build collaboration, teamwork, and cooperative skills. We do a lot of inquiry-based and Project-Based learning, and the activities in this book really help out! We've also found that the activities can be done with educators to build their teamwork skills!"
3,Last review inaccurate,"I just purchased this tv through philips outlet store, I have not received it yet, so we will see what happens when I do. But in regards to the ""fine print"" for the return policy, it states: ""Renewed product cannot be returned for credit, however this policy does not reduce your rights under your Purchased Products ""Limited Warranty"" for repair or exchange."" If you did receive a ""dead"" tv, there is still a 90 day warranty on it, which you can have it repaired, but it is unlikely to receive a ""dead"" product direct from the manufacturer. In a worst case scenrio if it was dead, I can still get it fixed for free, under the 90 day warranty. I have purchased many items that were ""factory-renewed"", and I have never had any trouble, if anything you save yourself time of getting it repaired if you bought it brand new, because the common issues with the models are already fixed."
4,The SP90 can be flash upgraded!,"If you want a blue SP100 without a remote and backlight, just flash upgrade your SP90 with the SP100 firmware. Just download the SP100 firmware and do the following:1. Rename the IMP-100.HEX file to SP-90.HEX2. With a Hex editor, open this firmware file and change the IMP-100 to SP-90 in the first line and resave the file.3. Burn a cd with this new SP-90.HEX file in the root directory.4. Place the cd in the player and turn it on.You now have a blue SP-100 that supports playlists, has shorter gaps between songs, user eq setting, faster load times, etc. And from now on, you can just flash this player with any SP-100 upgrade without having to edit the firmware as you had to do this one time.The SP-90 is a GREAT BUY now that you know it can be upgraded."
3,"Low battery life, not many other problems","Whoever says that this thing has amazing battery life probably doesn't own a RioVolt. They must be reading the product manual and just regurgitating it out there. The battery life on the sp90 is somewhere between 3 to 5 hours. It is nowhere near the 15 hours that they claim. However, I have had no problems playing CDs or mp3s, and no problems with skip (haven't really used it during exercise.) It's nice to have around and you can just switch around your mixes by changing CDs, which is nice."
1,This is not an Anti-Skip player!!!!,I also purchased this based on it's anti-skip claim and it fails miserably in that regard. It skips at the slighest jarring and I will be continuing my search for a true anti-skip mp3-cd player.
4,BUYING RIOVOLT SP90,"I like my newly purchased SP90. It plays my MP3s well compared to another player that I bought which kept skipping even when the MP3 player was in one place. The only one thing this player lacks is Firmware upgradability like the higher models. If the SP90 had this, and at this price, I would definatley give it five stars!"
5,I am craving more Gold!,"I would love to read this book again. But what would be the point! I remember each detail as though I had read it yesterday.Just looked up my old review and was amazed that it has been2 1/2 years since I read it. This will always be one of my all-time favorites. Glen, you are really Gold."
3,From 'Bang!' to 'Please be over soon!',"The first two hundred pages or so of ""Carter Beats the Devil"" are taut with tension, rich with historical detail, alive with vivid characters and memorable wit. And then there's the rest of the book. Too much plot and too many details conspire to slow what had been a speeding locomotive down to a crawl. And for all the over-writing, you're still left wondering about what makes the characters tick.Strange, but many of America's brightest writers these days have trouble sustaining momentum even while they pile on the pages. Michael Chabon's ""Kavalier & Clay"" also got off to a great start and then dragged to an underwhelming finish (Pultizer not withstanding). Ditto ""Empire Falls."" Wonder if Carter could conjure up the spirit of O. Henry to give these guys a crash course in keeping it short, sweet and satisfying."
3,"Starts well, but overlong and becomes unwieldy","I had been looking forward to reading this one for a while, so I was disappointed to find it has several first-novel-type flaws. The opening section is great, and so is the first act (the backstory), but when the action catches up with the narrative (acts 2 and 3) the plot is overwrought and the cast of characters unwieldy. Act 2 is particularly tough going, and I ended up doing something that I rarely do, skipping over pages quickly to get to the plot developments. The ending wraps things up nicely, but Gold doesn't need 500 pages to tell a story that would have been better delivered at 300 - a good edit is required. I'm hoping for better with Sunnyside."
4,Yummy,I highly recommend this tea - it's not an ordinary tea. Celestial Seasoning Dessert Tea in English Toffee I have found to be a great snack replacement when you feel like a little something but aren't really hungry. The tea completely makes you feel relaxed and in control...Like most Celestial Seasonings Teas.
5,Best Tea!,This is a great tea as you can add some sweetener and rice milk or cream and it's like having a coffee only better tasting and no caffeine!
2,did not get much out of this,"All the cd's seem to do is say a term, and its definition. Did not help me much. Will try some other way of learning."
4,Excellently done,"This is an excellent film if you're in the mood for some classy erotica. Kim Yates and Catalina Larranaga are classic beauties and both women shine in their performances. The weak link, if any, is Bobby Johnston; he comes off as a vacuous football player."
2,Lot of Hype for the Money,"First, the camera does look much more professional then the other consumer cameras. The software that comes with it and the ability to save to the SD card are also great... but after a few weeks of use the pan features inexplicably stopped working. The effort to get it repaired/replaced was such that we ended up not even bothering and just repositioned to get the best view from a fixed location."
3,"Beware, pricing rip-off","I bought this storage box at the hardware store for ~$10. The ONLY difference is the color - the top is grey, not blue. I hate how storage containers cost so much more as soon as the word ""scrapbooking"" gets attached to them.Other than that, the box is great. Perfect way to sort and store small embellishments, brads, eyelets, clips, rhinestones, etc. I keep all my adhesives in the top part for easy access, and it's easy to take on-the-go too."
4,Mildly adventerous,"See story summary above.Dean Ing's latest offering doesn't seem quite up to his usual thrills. Though it moves at a steady pace and has a gripping storyline, it just somehow lacks the suspense that I expect from him. The storyline does include a timely subject, objects known as UAV's-Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. The timely subject and the steady pace of the novel still made for a good quick read.Recommended."
2,Wrong book,"I ordered the wrong edition trying to save money, so I had to re-order the right edition later."
4,Good Item,This item works very well and I am happy with the performance. I would recomend to others.
3,Good,"The product came in a timely fashion. The seller said that it was ""new"" but the item had been opened so I really don't know if it was actually new or if they cleaned it up to make it look nice. I gave three stars mainly for this reason. In the past I had a seller send a ""new"" book that wasn't new at all. They actually tried to make it look new by covering it with shrink wrap, but when I opened it and went through the pages it had been marked in on several pages. So needless to say, since the hard plastic of the shipped item had been cut and opened, I can't agree with this seller that the item was new. Sorry. Oh...on a good note, the item works well. I have not had problems with it yet."
2,Terrible Volume,"I like how this Motorola headset fits. Very noninvasive. But I guess that's part of the problem. A) It feels cheap. B) It does not have sufficient volume. Even at the max setting. Granted, the cab of my vehicle is rather loud. C) I've been told that people couldn't hear me very well when I used the H350. I have since moved on to the Plantronics Voyager 510. It is more cumbersome, but has much louder volume. Also, I'm now told the Plantronics ""sounds"" like I'm on the phone, rather than speaking into a headset."
5,.,"I have to rate this very highly. Lyrically, Del cannot be touched. He must be rhyming 24/7 in his head because his rhymes are, for lack of a better word, professional. Straight skills. There are a few failures regarding the beats but it doesn't matter. 17 tracks with some of the most skillful and witty writing ever in the rap game."
2,"Works well, but the charging cord is lousy!!","This product worked well for us; unfortunately, when our baby was around two months old, the power cord for the handheld unit started acting up. It wouldn't power the handheld unit unless the unit was placed JUST SO on a tabletop. We since discarded it and got another one. I'm very unimpressed with this product."
2,so so reading,I really did not like this book. I didn't like the way the author wrote. It was very 50's. I didn't want to even finish the book.
3,Get Me Rewrite!,"This collection of articles, most originally published in The New Yorker, paint an interesting inside look at some of the more powerful big media players. Unfortunately, most of the material is outdated, having been superceded by events such as Tribune Co.'s acquisition of Times-Mirror, the forced resignation of Howell Raines at the New York Times after the Jason Blair scandal and the emergence of Fox as a one-sided cable news operation no longer bothering to masquerade as objective. Auletta stitches the pieces together with a few short paragraphs between each one, attempting to bring the reader up to date. Had he taken more than the few minutes of time which writing that material must have consumed and attempted to revise his old articles a bit more, the worth of his collection might have been improved. As it stands, it's already a period piece."
3,Well worth your time,"Auletta is one of the best thoughtful, dare I say, ""fair and balanced"" writers of media criticism out there. I can't see how very many people could argue with his findings, even if it casts them in a bad light, they are well documented and sourced.Media has been and is in a state of flux if not outright crisis since the late '90s, and though Auletta may not have a crystal ball, he is better than most at reading a map."
1,Too old to be worth reading,This book obviously is from the 70's. The book is nopt worth reading much less paying 15 bucks for. The author has new books out which are very complete and up to date. Amazon should be more careful about the books they sell unsless they can refund the money. jepetto@aol.com
1,Image is Everything,"The Image quality is very poor on this monitor, I suggest you purchase another brand, or at least, not this monitor. The image is fuzzy, and washed out compared to my old Tube Monitor, so I returned it and purchased another brand."
1,Ugly beyond imagination,"A very ugly monitor that gives below-average image quality. This is an old model and the contrast, which is difficult to adjust, really hurts your eyes after a few minutes. I think you'll need new glasses if you use this one. There are better products elsewhere (NEC, Kogi, etc.) for the same or better price."
1,Not a Good Book,"This book is bad, the topics are not in depth or well explained. Do not think to buy this book, if you are interested in the field of propagation buy ""Mobile Radio Propagation Channel""."
1,Worthless,"The Table of Contents is great, it covers every topic needed for a wireless communications class. But it is deceiving, the topics are not in depth or well explained. This book may be fine for the British with polarisation, but in the US, polarization is the correct spelling. The author may know what his is talking about, but he can't explain worth a darn. Buy a different book, this book has no practical use."
1,If I could give it zero stars I would,"Using this was sheer torture on my son, who has thick hair. The process took forever. The blades would stop constantly and I'd have to smack it on the table to get it going again. DO NOT BUY THIS!!"
4,"Thoughtful, original, a good read","This book uses the metaphor of judo as the basis for a surprisingly nuanced look at how (mostly) startups can compete with bigger companies. While some of the ideas the authors present are familiar (redefining the competitive space), many others are new or deserve to be emphasized in the new economic environment. The same goes for the examples. Many of the usual suspects (Southwest, Dell) appear, but often with a new twist, and the authors also discuss less-known companies like Transmeta.The book is a little heavy on high-tech/Internet-related examples, but overall, it's a good read, and unlike many others in the category, it's almost entirely jargon-free."
1,Total trash,Not a good book at all. Just text no material. There is a lot of proprietary knowledge that make the AS/400 tick. This book does little to shed light on this. Did not teach me anything that I did not know for FREE. If you get if for FREE then read it but PLEASE do not buy. Waste of printing material.
3,"good overall, not great","A good presentation. The information is good, narration by host (Bill Kurtis) is good, guest readers are good and pieces well chosen. My biggest complaint: the re-enactments are dissapointing. They are repetitive, and ""small"". A major battle often is represented by a handfull of people, often all that's shown is a few marching feet. Of the ""big three"" series, this one, ""Liberty"", and ""The Revolutionary War"" (with Charles Kuralt), I liked Kuralt's the best."
1,hardly worth it,"After a day or two, it worked as well as the old battery. It is a waste of time.It may not be the sellers fault but this item is crap. Maybe its been sitting around for 10 years and lost its charge.Item looked new but didn't perform new. Don't buy."
3,Junk -- Updated: now works fine,"This battery, fully charged when I went to bed, couldn't even hold a charge through the night. So my alarm didn't go off and I was late for an early phone conference. Total junk. I'm back at Amazon to buy a real one this time. Note that the junk battery looks identical to a real one, so all you can do is base your purchase on the reputation of the seller, user feedback, and price (cheap = danger).UPDATE:After several full rechargings, the battery now works fine. I'm not sure what the problem was, possibly that my Blackberry was indicating a full charge when the battery was not yet fully charged? I don't know. But after some initial frustration with this battery, I have to say I'm totally satisfied now. I'm upgrading to 3 stars because I don't know whether the original charging problem was the battery's problem, the device's, or operator error."
1,Blackberry C-M2 Standard battery,Battery does not hold a charge for more than 1 day. We may have a problem with the phones power draw but I'm not sure.
5,"If you like polkas AND tasteful music, this is it!","Big Lou is THE most glamorous, versatile and talented polka goddess in the US today. She sings in several languages, plays great accordion, and has the best outfits on the entire polka circuit. I especially love her duets with Glen Walters, and her creative use of kazoos. I give it a (high) five!"
3,Review of Essential CVS,"I am unimpressed with this book. I was hoping for much more. Basically, it is a parrot of most of the docs that come with it. So what's missing? It just doesn't go deep enough into how to use it in real life. How do you implement branch locking? How do you secure the server? What sort of example code could they present for the available hooks? There's a mild coverage on branching strategies but a couple of pages leaves you wanting more.Also, it talks about what graphic layers are available but it doesn't explain why one is better than another. Also, no mention of the fact that Cervisia is a stock component of Red Hat/KDE.All in all it's not bad for a beginner, but what a book like this really should provide are more of the paradigms."
4,Good book to establish version control,This is a good book if you are looking to establish version control with CVS. It covers the most common usage and the advanced usages are presented in an understandable format.
3,"Good,Interesting pictures, surprised at lack of information about them","For your money you'll get over 120 B/W photographs taken of people & places in New Mexico. Not very many of them are big city or landscape type stuff but more of a small town(village)/farm subject matter. Most are very nicely done, often covering subjects not usually seen in photobooks/magazines. I found dated photographs from about 1885 (1, I think)through the early 50's, it surprised me just how many undated, unattributed photographs there were. Apparently many of them were taken and only the general location written down, no dates, subject's identities or photographer's names given (I would guess by the clothing that most of these were done in the 30's and 40's). This is an interesting book, I just wish that someone had thought to write down some more information!"
4,Modern collection of poetry,"If I'm honest, I will say I haven't read much poetry. It is interesting to see how poetry has changed throughout the ages. Siken is a modern poet who uses vivid language and images that are crude and at times terrible. He demonstrates raw emotions and situations that are reckless and exciting. In my opinion, this is a great portrayal of American culture, most specifically suburbia. The overall prose and tone of his writing is dark and captivating, it is almost seductive."
3,Good but far from original,"This book is just a carbon copy of most of the popular poetry on DeviantArt. I know 14 year old girls who write the exact same things, in the exact same style of diction."
5,WORK WELL,"For thick files or books, pamphlets, etc. Too bad the colored ones were more expensive. My file drawers are open and the green is very blah."
5,Excellent quality,"Very well made with reinforced bottom. I got these and a box of 1"" capacity. I have used high capacity hanging folders for years. I'm mostly using these to replace Pendaflex High Capacity folders that are 25 years old. They make filing and retrieval of documents so much easier than when using overstuffed regular folders."
3,Not stable,When I bought these I thought they had closed ends but they don't. The folders do their job but they are not stable and they are always falling off of the metal sides. If I have something heavy inside weighing it down then they work just fine.
5,Delightfully told classic with a smart twist,"""Beauty"" was a gem! Finally, a classic fairytale with an intelligent female character! I loved the incorporation of the traditional story line into a wonderful character developement. It's priceless!"
2,Eh... lands a little flat,"I found this book while casually browsing through a bookstore and bought it because I had seen great reviews of it online and I really loved the Disney version of this classic fairytale.However, halfway through the book I found myself uninterested with the cardboard-like characters who all seemed to have the same personality. This book also could have been much shorter - McKinley, I felt, went too overboard with the description. For example, she spent two long paragraphs describing dark woods EVERYTIME one of the characters went into it. It was very tedious to read this book and it neither tickled my imagination nor made me feel any inspiration or love of the book like so many other books made me feel.I actually find myself wishing I had spent my time reading another book rather than this one. I do not recommend purchasing or reading this book."
5,Putting the beauty in Beauty and the Beast!,"Of all the books I've readÑand there are many, I assure youÑthis is still one of my favorites. Since I first read it in third grade (or was it fourth?) I've been enchanted by the touching retelling of such a classic fairy tale. I must have read and re-read it a hundred times since then (wellÑthat might be a slight exaggeration), but I love the book dearly!Robin McKinley is one of my favorite authors, weaving wonderful characters, eloquent descriptions, true humor and imaginative plots together in the way only a true fantasy author can. And she does it better nowhere than this book! (Though I am also smitten with all her other booksÑthis was the first I read, and is probably still my favorite. Probably.)Anyone who loves fantasy, or any great book for that matter, should read this as soon as possibly (and make sure to start at a time when you don't have anything you have to do for a whileÑI gaurantee you won't be able to put it down!)"
3,"ehh...so-so, average, medium, in the middle book","Your average old, typical old, bag of medieval mixes. Not much action or suspense if you ask me, more of a book you'd read a chapter a day from, nothing to make you want to continue on with questions or curiousity. I highly recommend loyal Mckinley fans to try either SHERWOOD SMITH's COURT DUEL & CROWN DUEL or TAMORA PIERCE's ALANNA. Both are action packed, full of surprises and twists. Have fun reading."
4,My favorite book growing up,"I love this retelling of Beauty and the Beast. The story comes alive. Robin Mckinley has done an excellent job at pulling the reader into this fairy tale. This was my favorite book growing up. The book pulls at your emotions, we can all relate to Beauty's struggle with her own name. I love it!"
5,Gorgeous storytelling,"This is a retelling of the classic fantasy Beauty and The Beast. But this version has a bit of a twist, McKinley's ""Beauty"" doesn't quite live up to her nickname and can be more accurately described as an awkward teenager, a girl who prefers to spend her free time with books and horses. I liked her immediately. When her Father accidentally stumbles upon the bewitched castle of the ""Beast"" he is forced into a promise that will forever change Beauty's life. To give anymore of the plot away would be to ruin the magic of the book.BEAUTY is categorized as a children's book (10 and up) but I think it will appeal to anyone who loves a magical, sweet, old-fashioned love story. McKinley's characters are well-drawn, sympathetic and just plain lovable, right down to Beauty's charming horse. This was another one of those rare ""unputdownable"" books for me. It's a keeper and one I intend to read to my babies when they're old enough to sit still long enough to enjoy it."
5,Beauty is beautiful,"I loved this book. Actually it is one of the best books I have ever read. It is romantic, pure and inspiring. It sparks the imagination and pulls at your heart. It is a wonderful fairy tale/fantasy book yet it has a touch of reality that makes the story believable. It is a must read for young and old alike."
5,Absolute Perfection,"The best, without at doubt, adaptation of the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale. Beauty is no longer a two dimensional fairy-tale heroine. Beauty is intelligent, loves learning, and riding her horse. When her family's fortunes take a turn for the worse, she shows her strenght, taking on much of the hard work forced upon her family by their financial downfall. She isn't perfect; occasionally she complains, she can be stubborn and willful, but she is more real than Beauty has ever been.The supporting character are created with as much loving care. No cardboard cutouts of selfish sisters or a bumbling father. Each character is drawn with meticulous care.Buy this book, read it, read it to your kids, or your spouse, or even your grandmother. You won't regret it."
3,"In responce to the other guy,","Heres the deal, Marilyn Manson sounds nothing like X, the guy who compared them shouldnt have done so. Dont worry, if you dont like Marilyn Manson, you will still like X.Also, Dont get this album and DVD. Instead, buy their first album, Vanishing Vision, one of the most amazing albums ever made. Everything else they did was ham and cheese, adding boring ballads to their albums. The album Jealousy was really good too if you like the band buy that, but trust me on this, Vanishing Vision will definitly impress you, and is a good introduction to the band. Yoshiki is an amazing drummer, but the guitarist Hide is equally impressive.Last, i have to add in that I dont like japanese music. Most of its pretty dull, but for some reason i've become a big fan of this band."
4,Enjoyable book,"I enjoyed reading this book to my children for several reasons. The pictures were nicely drawn and colorful. My five year old liked to watch a new insect appear on each page and I helped her identify each type of flower that was featured as the story of the bee sleeping in the Rose unfolded. The style of the story was repetitive and progressive, in a "". . . the house that Jack built"" way, which appeals to young readers. The rhymes were fun, and some lines had internal rhymes as well."
4,"Easy read, full of information","This book is great for kids and the uninitiated adult alike. I got it for my two sons, and was surprised to find that I learned a few things from it as well. Interesting, fun and informative.The CD that came with it was great as well."
4,Good accessory to have,"Attached it to a HP 7150 and it works wonderfully. Extremely easy to install. Contruction is very similar to that of the printer. There seems to be a longer than usual pause to let the ink dry before the printer flips the page over and prints on the reverse side.The price is steep, but as would be expected for a HP accessory. If you do a lot of two sided printing, this accessory is a major convenience."
2,No Caller ID,"This phone was everything I wanted but when it arrived, I saw that it did not have a caller ID screen. I think that in 2010 people assume that a feature like caller ID will be included in a phone, especially one with so many other features."
2,Panasonic corded speakerphone,This phoneis a wall phone but it dials instead of punching the number straight as other phones do.I cannot dial on speakerphone setting as I wish.
3,Requires batteries for speakerphone and memory,"Previous Radio Shack speaker phone did not need batteries -- this one does. Battery life is said to be about 6 months, and batteries need to be changed within one minute to retain memorized numbers. Sound quality is ok."
1,Don't Buy this Phone,"I purchased this phone for my grandmother (in her 80's) several months ago. When I went home for Christmas, I saw her phone and asked how it was working. It wasn't and she didn't want to hurt my feelings by telling me. It worked fine at first but after about two weeks, the buttons stopped working. The dial tone is there but when you begin to dial a phone number, the dial tone continues and the buttons are not recognized by the phone. It still rings but that's about it. And because she didn't tell me, I've missed the return window."
4,PANASONIC KX-TS105W,"Nice well designed phone. Very easy to program. Takes 3 AA batteries for memory presets. I purchased two of these phones, one for my grandparents who promptly dropped the phone on the kitchen floor ejecting the batteries thereby erasing all the pre-programmed numbers that I had entered. Battery cover needs to be taped down to prevent this, as battery cover does not close well (Panasonic could have designed a better battery cover into this phone as they have with other models).Phone has nicely sized buttons, loud ringer and well functioning speakerphone feature as well as a headset jack. Receiver cord is a bit short but can easily be replaced with a longer one. Will review again as the phones age."
4,Different,Not a bad Movie but definetly different. Salma Hayek is Hot as usual and does a really great laundrymat scene. This Movie will not fit all tastes. The story line is hard and gritty and cuts no corners making it's point. Life in the big city is tough and in order to make it sometimes you need to sell more than your virtue.I've just one question... What about the Soundtrack? The music was great it should have one.
1,"Awful acting, awful story - don't waste your money","The acting performances of D'Onofrio and Hayek were simply miserable. I found myself laughing numerous times because the acting was so pathetic. I still cannot figure out why a bedraggled, greasy D'Onofrio was cast as Valentino, and why he had two lovers tormenting over his illness. Neither his appearance or personality were desirable, leaving the character of Valentino completely unbelievable. The constant bickering of Hayek and ""Gary"" became annoying and predictable. This movie had potential, but terrible acting, terrible casting and cumbersome plot makes this movie virtually unwatchable. Easily the worst movie I have ever seen."
4,Mic Adapter,"I needed an adapter for my Shure mic to plug into a 1/4 jack. The SLR adapter fits my need to a ""T"". I use it on the end of the cable."
2,Mine needed tape,"The unit that I got wouldn't hold my mic cable securely (it kept falling out) I used a piece of duct tape on it, and now it works great. (Is there anything duct tape CAN'T do?)"
1,Really bad,"They sent me the wrong item, but since I will need to shipp it back and pay, I just throw it in the garbage."
5,20 years and still making hits,NE's new cd is their best work yet. They continue to put out hot music after all this time. It amazes me how many people have slept on them but this cd is the best cd in years. You can let the whole cd play. Every song has meaning. They didn't try to do the music out today they stayed within the NE sound and updated that. If i could i would give this cd 20 stars it's just that good. If you don't have it you are truly missing out on the best cd in years.
4,Finally a real R&B cd.,"""One Love"" is a great comeback cd for NE. These men still have all the talent that they had years ago. i kinda wish they had more slow songs on the album, but its still a solid album. some of the highlights are:""Rewrite The Memories""""The Newness""""All On You"" (hot upbeat song, great flows by the sexy R. Devoe)""Leave Me""""Wildest Dreams""""That's Why I Lied""""Love Again""The other songs on this album are great also but these are my personal favs. go out and buy the album, you won't be dissapointed.-stacie"
3,nato,"This album pretty much follows the formula.... The fusion of jazz and electronics is there; as is the complex layering of sounds in (most) songs. Oh, and the trademark ""ba-ba-ba-di-da-da-da"" vocals from Laetitia. That the album wallows in the latter makes it a little disappointing. With the exception of ""The Free Design"" and ""Blue Milk"" in particular, this album is just a little too kitschy. So, it's questionable as to whether ""Cobra & Phases"" will attract new fans. However, it IS another Sterelolab release, and many (including myself) will buy it for this reason.If you're unsure about which Stereolab album to get, then I'd recommend ""Emperor Tomato Ketchup"" and ""Dots & Loops"" before buying ""Cobra and Phases"". If you're just unsure...then try The High Llamas (""Snowbug""), Solex (""Pickup""), Alpha (""Come From Heaven""), or even The Now Sound of Ursula 1000 (self-titled, for something more beaty), too. Cheers! Ps: I gave it 3.5 stars..."
3,Good not great,"The only problem I have with this cd is that it's too damn long. There is a stretch of 3 songs towards the end of the cd that should have been taken out and made into their own ep perhaps. Then the rest of the record would be classic, because this record includes some absolutely terrific music. But when the cd is so long it's hard to hold your interest throughout. Or maybe since ""Dots and loops"" and ""Tomato Ketchup"" are so good, it's hard to measure up. Still, Stereolab are great no matter what."
4,"Ca c'est pas leur classique, mais c'est tres bon!","It's not difficult to compare any recent Stereolab work to kitschy jazz albums from the early to mid sixties or maybe some retro ""Escoval"" sound, but their work is truly contemporary. To me their benchmark album is ""Emperor Tomato Ketchup"" to which others are compared, but that is a limiting approach to their music. This new album is certainly more lush and jazzy with the horn elements--and it works, though long winded in a couple of instances. It touches on the Bossa Nova elements of 60's jazz and freight trains into Dave Brubeck at the same time. The fault lies in the fact that it is a bit erratic in the song line up. Perhaps this gem could be a definite diamond it the songs were realigned to work better in a different sequence. However, we can all live with it the way it is and certainly love it (yet all their albums take more than one listen, i.e. Brian Wilson style). Salut."
4,bring on,"everyone seems keen on this because it is not kid rock or whatever and its electronic, experimental..entailing everything from krautrock, italian soundtracks, bacharach, lounge, the influence of chicago and many others..the fact of the matter is this just isnt as good as the two previous stereolab records...mostly because of the fluff on it and because the formula they have found themselves needs more progression(as they did on the other albums) i think the ppl they use for colloborations and production add more sense of progression than anything else..this album isnt as enjoyable as the previous two either..that said, my main criticism is about 4 or 5 songs that are mediocre..its still go great moments(track 14, 2, 7, 6 and 9 and some others..)"
4,The kids loved it.,"A little bit dorky, a little bit mean, but with flashes of brilliance. My kids just loved it and would love to have more Zach and Cody. My eldest thought the kissing stuff was a little bit much, and while she was OK with it, she said she wasn't sure if she could show it to her friends."
2,Kevin Shields worship at its worst...,"... Which is sad because Scott's other (main?) band, Lovesliescrushing, builds off My Bloody Valentine's more abstract tracks (i.e. To Here Knows When, Glider, etc.) and takes them to the next level. But outside of a few tracks here, Scott is content with being nothing more than a Kevin Shields rip-off."
5,Cheap and Fast,"This rocket is built for speed and for height. It is small with a very durable fin system. It is not a difficult rocket to make and it will take you about an hour to make it - depending on glue drying time. Everything about it is designed to minimize weight without sacrificing strength so it can go fast and high.It has a streamer rather than a parachute which is a good thing because of the height it attains. With a parachute it could very well sail off quite a distance from your launch zone.I like the solid fin system. They are stronger than normal. I found the recommended painting scheme to be a bit too much, even though I did it by the suggested way. You might just want to spray paint the whole thing one solid color.Nice little rocket, cheap and fast.Remember that this is just a rocket. You still have to purchase engines, wadding and a launcher if you are just starting out in the hobby."
4,beautiful voice,"It is nice to hear some easy musics (like Lehar and Kalman operettas) -beside the calssical songs- form the incredible sensitive singer, like Pilar Lorengar was.It is a pitty that her publicity never raised her among the great singers of her time.Highly reccomend to everybody."
4,good atlas for good price,"I bought this book used for under $40. For the price, it was a steal. The book is about 8 years old now, some things are not uptodate with regard to treatments and a few other things (like I believe they refer to VEGF as angiogenic factor). However, as a good atlas with excellent pictures and good descriptions of disease states, I find it an excellent complement to a general ophthalmology atlas. There is also text on vitreoretinal surgery which is useful as a foundation for residents starting a retina rotation."
1,Useage Review,I received the product as expected. It failed to work and I returned it to Amazon. Panasonic tech support was unable to resolve the issue. I DO NOT recommend this phone.
3,disappointed phone,"I have a panasonic phone for 20 years, and it still works fine, except that the buttons are not very good now, and I have to press really hard to get it working. So I decided to buy a new panasonic phone. This phone sounds like a good choice. The first day I started to use the phone using the speaker/mic, the other party complained that I did not speak, actually, I was talking all the time. After a few complains, I did a test myself: use a cellular to talk to this phone. I was on the cellular side, and my daughter was counting numbers with this phone. Then I noticed the problem: 10% of time, I could not hear a sound. It was the problem of this phone. Therefore, I had to return the phone back to Amazon. my old phone is still out-performs this one.I still give a rating of 3 stars, instead of 1 or 2, as my good impression of the old phone."
2,A disappointment,"I purchased two of these phones based upon the previous customer reviews. I was looking for a phone with at least above average sound quality. Other customer reviews gave me the impression that this phone would satisfy these requirements. My previous phone sounded signifiantly better and it was about 1/2 the price. Most people would find the sound quality alright, but if you are looking for above average sound quality you will not find it in this phone. I'm quite disappointed. The rest of the phone's features are fine - no complaints except for the primary reason why I purchased this phone."
5,Excellent basic phone,"I found this to be an excellent phone with all the necessary features that I wanted. I was tired of the small, heavy, one-piece phones with marginal sound quality. This has very clear sound and when called at work I can tell the outgoing quality is just as good. I am not a speaker phone person so no comment on that. The memory feature is easy to use and convenient but common to most phones. Pay a little more for this higher quality phone and you'll like it. $20 dollar phones just won't give you this clarity."
4,Great Value,"Nice phone for the money,would be 5 stars but the phonehas a LCD display instead of a LED display,which makes itvery hard to see the time. Sound quality isvery good."
1,Embarrassing,"Embarassingly bad, this book shows that just because your an academic, does not mean you have anything worth saying. I have three problems with this book:1. Her arguments don't follow her line of reasoning. I will give her credit for laying out a framework to guide her arguments, though she fails to back them in my view.2. She uses newspaper articles as primary sources. I learned in junior high school that this is a no no. I'm a little frightened that this ""academic"" teaches young and old people at a major university, probably ""requiring"" them to read this book.3. She claims to speak from an American point of view, which seems to me that of a white, well to do perspective. Her profound lack of history and knowledge of the different cultures in this country make her arguments offensive.Thank god for the library. I couldn't stand to have such poor writing in my house for more than two days."
1,Christian agnosticism,"The problem that all authors of books similar to this one face is the fact that there is really no such thing as a ""just war"" as far as Christ is concerned. If you are a REAL Christian who believes that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and, as such, IS God,and do all you can to live as Christ did, which is what He commanded of all true Christians, you can NEVER subscribe to the ""just war"" THEORY (I remind all...it's called a ""theory""). Jesus was COMPLETELY (I repeat, COMPLETELY)NON-VIOLENT. To imply otherwise in order to realize a Constantinian (church-state) agenda is the height of hypocrisy and falsehood. The present author, Weigl, Novak, Neuhaus, et. al., are morally bankrupt apologists for Christian agnosticism...that's all."
1,SEVERE BATTERY PROBLEMS,"I PURCHASED THIS PANASONIC CORDLESS STRICTLY ON REPUTATION.THIS TELEPHONE COULD BE AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT, IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE FAILURE OF THE CHARGING SYSTEM & BATTERIES THAT IT UTILIZES.THIS PHONE IS USELESS FOR OTHER THAN SHORT & FEW CONVERSATIONS.THE NI-CAD BATTERIES ARE TERRIBLE & LAST ONLY A SHORT TIME...THE TRUTH IS 6 HOURS STANDBY & 1/2 HOUR TALK TIME & NO SPARE BATTERY CHARGING ABILITY. NOTHING !!!!!!NOW I HAVE THREE HANDSETS & THE BASE TELEPHONE & MY ONLY RECOURSE IS TO TOSS IT AWAY & START OVER. THE SIEMENS I HAD PREVIOUSLY WAS EXCELLENT ON BATTERIES USAGE, BUT IT HAD RECEPTION PROBLEMS, SIEMENS UTILIZES NICKLE METAL HYDRIDE RECHARGABLES. IT ALSO HAD THE ABILITY TO CHANGE BATTERIES.PANASONIC, LIKE MANY OTHER COMPANIES REALLY STICK IT TO YOU BY MAKING YOU BUY THEIR BATTERIES, WHICH ALWAYS REQUIRE REPLACEMENTS.STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE, OR YOU TOO WILL BE FOOLED"
1,6 of 7 handsets defective - do not buy!,"I purchased a KX-TG2740S with two additional handsets. Within 2 months the LCD displays on all 3 handsets failed. I sent 2 handsets to Panasonic factory service and received 2 refurbished ones in return. The display on both of those did not work at all. I sent all three handsets back and have received two more refurbished ones. The display on one did not work. That's a failure rate of 6 out of 7. Panasonic will not or cannot provide a product that works and will not provide a refund. Terrible product, terrible service."
1,More of the same negatives as other reviews,Spent a lot of extra money on new batteries for the main and remote units but they failed to hold a charge too for any longer than 20 minutes.There is no warning that the battery is low and that the line will disconnect at any moment. Don't buy this system. I need to buy a set of phones that doesn't get old after 3 months of use.
2,"Great features, Terrible Battery life","I agree completely with everyone's assessment of the battery life on the handset. I rarely have the handset off the cradle, and if I am lucky, I can get the handset battery to last 35 minutes. Another thing that irks me about the battery life is, the handset will show full-charge in the battery meter, and then 2 seconds later, it's beeping and the battery meter is flashing because it's about to die. It's all or nothing.The features of the phone are good, but the battery life gives frustration on this nearly $200 phone."
2,Lots of features-Poor range and batteries,This phone has a lot of features. It means well but fails in execution. The range is not all that good and the battery performance is dreadful.
1,Useless phone,I strongly agree with all the people having battery problems. I purchased this model less than a year ago. I started facing battrey problems just after a month. With a full charge it last for less than 10 minutes. I also have an additioal set that has the same problem.
3,NIMH Battery,"This isn't exactly a review because I haven't purchased the phone yet but am seriouly considering it. I am writing this to dispute some information in the review by a reviewer in San Diego. He says that to avoid the problems with the battery mentioned by several reviewers, he purchased the NIMH battery that was available for it. Since I couldn't find such a battery I called Panasonic directly and was told that there is not a NIMH battery available for this model. They do claim that the problems with the NICD battery have been addressed and corrected as have the problems with Caller ID."
2,Wireless Interference,"Many seem to be concerned about interferences with their 2.4 GHz WLAN. I operated my WLAN access point 6 feet away from the base station of this phone for 6 months and did not experience any noticable problems or performance issues. However, I do have interferences with my X10 wireless camera that make my surveillance system practically unusable. Nobody tells you about that. There are just too many devices on the market that operate in the 2.4 GHz band.Therefore, this phone has to go in exchange for a 5.8 GHz model (unfortunately, there are no 2-line phones on the market yet in the 5.8 GHz segment).I was reasonably satisfied with the features, although I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the directory is too complicated to search."
2,HP software and support is horrible,"Ok, The scanner says 48bit color. It only scans 24bit. There are no settings anywhere to access the full range of 48 bit. (yes I know there are only a few packages that support more bit depth but photoshop is one of them).Next, you can't scan multiple docs from within photoshop. The dialog box closes down between scans. It also doesn't remember your scan settings. Everytime you open the software it has some funky default scan settings that trash your image. Every utility included with the package has it's own default settings."
2,Quality is not garanted as the original battery,"I bought two batteries of this type. One came good, the otherone didn't work and when I put it into the camera, an error appeared. I tried to charged it, but after hours of ""charging"" the battery remained off. So I had to discarded it, and because I live outside USA, for me is better to forget about it against to return this stuff.Conclusion: I payed one battery for the prices of two."
2,"ruin the reputation of ""made in japan"" label",Mine was working fine until I had to replace the carbon film the first time. Then the 1-year old unit simply quitted working. Normally I am quite good at figuring out mechanical problems by myself. Not this one.Then I found out there are unlimited supply of Remanufactured Brother 1270E fax machines. How could so many units need to be repaired?I am a non-Japanese Asian who likes Japanese quality stuff. This model ruins my confidence in Japanese product.
1,No longer a good product. An exercise in frustration!,"I used to have this fax machine at my former office and it was a great piece of office equipment. When I went to my present place of employment, they used the same fax machine and it worked splendidly for about three and a half years. Then it broke down and was replaced with the same model. Only this new machine was endlessly frustrating. When trying to fax something, it would invariably skew the paper and then jam. It could take fifteen minutes to do a simple 1 or 2 page fax job. After several months of trying to work with this machine, we changed it for a new copy of the same model, and guess what---we have the exact same problem! The new fax machine also skews and jams paper. I have no choice, having received 2 lemons in a row to conclude that this model has gone downhill in quality. Not recommended."
1,What happened with the price?,"I saw it on sale for $53.39, next day the price went up. I told my friend about the price, he gave me a check for me to go ahead and buy the item since he does not have a computer. When I came home to purchase it, the price was WAY UP to $89 ??? What's up with that~!???"
4,Homoerotic photographs abounds,"O Rio De Janeiro is basically a huge volumne of pics (mostly black and white and presumably taken in Rio, Brazil) by Bruce Weber. Despite the cover which featured a guy staring lustily at a girl, who in turn, looked away from in and toward the reader, this book is really a book for gay men.Homoerotic photographs abound, mostly of young men louging around in bikini briefs, either on bed, in apartments, on roof tops, during a soccer match, on the beach, and so on.For gay men, this book is a delicious affair...and little else."
2,What Mystery?,I read a lot of mysteries and had hoped this would be a good one given the intersection between my professional life in academe and my love for a good puzzle. The book is a clever way to raise issues relevant to faculty development but not much of a mystery.
2,Inconsistent quality,"I ordered some of these for my home and classroom. The first shipment was of very poor quality. The bookends had scratches, missing coating, dried globs of coating, and two were bent. I returned them for replacements. Some of the replacements were fine, and some were as bad as the ones in the first shipment. In additon, one had a dark reddish stain on it that looked like it could be dried blood. I was told to return them for a refund. I wrapped the stained one in a plastic bag and put a warning label on it when I returned them. I kept the good quality ones, and I like them a lot. I was shocked at the condition of the ones I had to return. I give two stars for the good quality of those I kept and ease of return(amazon provided prepaid labels both times), but I would never buy these again. I also bought the regular ones (not nonskid) in 9 and 5 inch sizes, in the same tan color, and had no problems with those types at all."
4,Perfect Bathroom Reading,"Funny, broad-minded humor book, perfect for a quick pick-up read of a few pages or a lengthier amount of research on real signs spotted around the world by intrepid travellers and amusingly captioned by Doug Lansky."
3,Disappointed in color,"I have ordered these folders several times before and they're very functional, but for some reason, this time the folders came out a darker blue color (I double checked the lot number and it was the same as all previous orders). It is too close to another color I use for a different purpose - I like to color code my files. I will keep them because it's a pain to send things back and I can use them for other purposes outside of my business, but I definitely was disappointed."
1,Not worth it,"This program is one of the worst I have ever purchased. Fisrt - it will not run with NORTON running -- even though it accesses the internet. That alone makes me want to not use it. Had to call support to get it to load and after 30 minutes and 2 reboats, it still will not run correctly. Going to take them up on their 60 day refund policy."
1,re-rating after changes,"i was very critical at first because the album didn`t flow for me.I think i`ve cracked it try it this way track11,12,13,4,8,5,2,6,7,3,9,1,.The album seems to flow now and you begin to apreciate the music more.I couldn`t rate it 5 just because it was michael but now in this order i will rate it a 4."
1,The ink prints faded,"The ink prints out faded and unreadable. The ink cartridge is completely unusable, and I have been trying for over a month to get a refund, or even a replacement. It has been a huge disappointment."
1,Empty,"Empty/Dry cartridge, dated 2007. Purchased in 2009. Sure, it's genuine, but check the date.If you only keep one in reserve, this will be a shock when you need it. If you keep several in reserve, then you run the risk that the older ones will dry out before you use them."
4,Nice sell,"Same as you get in the store, just cheaper.Plus bring the empty cartridiges to Staples and get more money back.Nice!!"
2,MALFUNCTION,The ink in the cartridge dried up within 4 months use . It was only good for about 120 print pages.
4,Great young adult Sci Fi,"If you read through these reviews, you will see one comment after another comparing Starswarm to Heinlein's earlier works. Its an apt conclusion. Pournelle crafted a nice story here.Primarily, the plot surrounds a young kid 'Kip', who is growing up in a distant outpost on an alien planet. He has one friend, a young girl about his age, and a voice that talks to him in his head. The outpost is situated next to an ancient 'Starswarm', a name used for a certain huge plant that lives on this planet.The plot develops in a pretty straight forward manner. Nothing too unexpected occurs. Basically you have a swashbuckling tale. If your looking for a good book and want a very light enjoyable read, this would fit the bill."
1,"Professional, predictable, and pedantic.","Starswarm was written by someone who has fabricated several pounds of novels and read even more. The plot has been used in dozens of novels and hundreds of video games and thousands of movies. Viz: Plucky youth with secret identity sneaks thru villains to find the holy grail, claim his birthright, and win the girl.In this case the hero Kip is a ""prince of the blood"" gone into hiding with a faithful retainer, and a ""magic"" helper. An ursurper is on his tail. At no time is there any suspense. At no time is any character other than a cardboard cut-out. At no time is the history and society of Kip's world other than briefly sketched in.Been there, done that, have the T-shirt."
2,not quality product,poor ink quality...don't think that it's original hp cartridge. Supposed to be black ink but printed in brown!
2,"Cuisinart Can Opener with ABS Handle, Black","The can opener is good overall, but the handle it not what I expected. It is unconfortable and does not form to my fingers when turning."
2,Fun for Kids but BAD QUALITY,"This tube is real fun, kids love it but the quality is bad. The back rest bladder cannot last more than 4 month and then it starts falling apart, and of course the warranty is only 3 month. So far I have replaced it 4 times. The main bladder is bit better if you are lucky it will last 2 summers."
2,"Decent Tube, but material rips","I liked this tube and it rode well with three teens untill my second summer owning it, when the material ripped."
4,Not so relaxing time on the farm.,Vol. 2 does not dissapoint as Snow learns there are many depths to her sister when they find the farm in upheaval. To say more would give away an exciting story that is well worth reading. And as always the story is beautifully drawn and inked.
4,Good story,"I'm enjoying the characters and their interactions most in this series so far. The stories are good, but not my all time favorites or anything. I'm told it only gets better, so I'll definitely be grabbing the next volume."
3,Baseball Legend,"The book ""Becoming Joe DiMaggio"" was a a good book overall. It is about Joseph Paul growing up and learns about the game of baseball. He falls in love with the sport and soon learns the rules and how the game is played. He loves his grandfather and would do anything to make him happy and hopes to make it to the majors his dream. This book is a very quick read and somewhat a confusing book. But overall it was entertaining and i would recommend it to anyone from grades 5th and up."
3,Watered down cross between Cactus and Blues Image...,"It's hard to write this because I'm a big fan of Cactus and Blues Image, not to mention Mike Pinera's superb work on Iron Butterfly's Metamorphosis. There's a reason Son of Cactus II never appeared, and you'll find it right here. To the point, Son of Cactus reeks of a rush job from the very first track and it doesn't let up. The song lyrics wander in and out of triteness, and the music lacks the fire and originality that made the aforementioned bands legendary. Although it doesn't qualify as a disaster, don't expect a lot based on their credentials. This is boilerplate rock 'n' roll; okay for what it is, but it falls woefully short of the potential."
4,Sweeeet!,I really am impressed by this particular instructional dvd. Even after the very first try my joints felt so much better. I am optimistic about refining this modality. [...]
5,Awesome.,This is a fantastic DVD and the scenery is incredible. The Garrapoli's are engaging and informative. A very good example of Qigong.
4,A storytime success,"The clear photos with humorous cartoon-like embellishments are very appealing to kids. Though the fold-out design makes it tricky to share the book with a group, the question-and-answer format holds kids' attention. I was able to withhold the book's ""gimmick""-- the large, full-length picture of the lamb-- until the very end when I used it with my library storytime groups."
2,Thorough but unreadable,"This textbook is very thorough but some of the writing style is so unnecessarily obtuse that it is frustrating to the college student, which is its audience. The difference between the two authors seems to be apparent in the clarity of the writing. I was left guessing which author I found readable and which one I didn't. Although I continue to use this text, I am always looking out for an alternative. Even I, the professor, have to go to secondary sources to see what the author is trying to say."
1,Lump of Coal,"One star is being generous. While I am an avid fan of Christmas and tremendously enjoy most things related to Christmas; not even Christmas could make this DVD worthwhile. The acting is subpar and the plot is very predictable. I could not get through the movie in one sitting. The only reason I went back to finish it, was because I was searching for one redeeming quality. At last I found one -- the ending credits."
1,Bad choice,"The acting in this movie is so bad. Granted the story line was just like others, but I like watching Christmas stories. This one is not worth the cost of shipping let alone the real cost of the DVD."
2,Quality Problems,"I have bought the HP 7550 twice, and had to return it twice. The purchase was from a major retailer. It was easy to set up and the prints were good, but the machine was not properly calibrated from the factory, so that 6x4 in. borderless prints would not print on the 6x4 paper without leaving a border on one side or the other. After two hours problem solving with customer service, they suggested I return it. I returned it for another HP 7550 (factory unopened box). This time it was calibrated properly. Some pictures looked great, but on pictures with a lot of black or red, there was a noticable red marbeling in the pictures, and black never looked to be solid balck. Once again, after two hours on the phone problem solving, HP customer service suggested I return it either to HP or the dealer. I wonder how many others are havong quality problems. My next printer will not be an HP."
1,The print cartridge holders break.,I am on my second one. HP sent me a replacement for the first which I appreciate greatly but having the replacement break as well is truly a pain. Today I was printing and red turned to pink. The tiny plastic arm that holds in one of the cartridges has broken again. On the replacement unit!! Otherwise I'm truly happy with this printer but this seems like a design flaw.
2,"Yes, there is NO USB cable...","When I looked at the reviews for this printer, one said there was no USB cable included. I could hardly believe it, but ordered one, just to be safe. And good thing, because there was none. Even the instructions say to purchase a cable, but it's a little late. Be warned!!The print quality is stunning, but the mechanics of this printer are frightening. It has ruined almost every other sheet of photo paper I've used, with the ink carriage getting stuck on the crumpled paper and tearing it. Irritating and expensive. Is this a new HP money-making strategy?? I've learned to NEVER let it grab the last sheet of paper. That never, ever prints correctly.The print cartridges are scary to put in. I don't like this machine, and I forsee a lot of mechanical difficulty and repairs ahead. And the ink is used up so fast, it's like pouring it out of the cartridges. Yeah, it's neat, and has a lot of features, but if it doesn't print reliably, oh boy...."
5,Best explanation for object oriented programming book,This is the best book for beginning objected oriented programming I have read. It explains clearly step by step how object are created and used. All of the OO buzz words are explained with clearly written examples that you can actually understand.The programming concepts to fully utilize OO programming is explained with examples that are understandable so that you can use the concepts for your own programming.Also explain C# language in terms of OO programming and methodology so that you learn the language while learning how to program OO. Buy This Book!
4,COURAGEOUS BUT TROUBLED,"This is an above-average account of one soldier's experiences in Vietnam for seven years, much of it in combat and out in the bush on special operations. The author is brave and stubborn, but I also perceive him as a troubled soul, anti-authority and a somewhat questionable team player. He operated deep in enemy territory, and set up captures of high-ranking officers and ambushes. He knew if he made an error in judgement or movement, especially wearing the enemy's uniform, that the slightest mistake meant instant death. In this tome, he talked about his sexual exploits, smoking dope and being involved in fragging. He was more than a maverick - and his independent actions could affect others in tragic ways. Being the leader, would I want him on my team? I would have to think long and hard, but if I needed a 'special guy' for a special, delicate operation, Cornett would get my vote."
4,Great personal narrative,"His honesty about himself makes it easy to believe that Cornett is honest about others. One gets a sense of who the real heroes are and are not and why America could never succeed in any of our goals in that country despite some men working very hard to make that happen. Karl mentioned that the author had trouble with authority. I saw it as the author having trouble with lazy, dangerous (but not to our enemies), clueless, and power-hungry idiots. Two men fit that bill perfectly. His senior officers have just called his Vietnamese wife a whore... and he frags one of them. I noticed that the Courts Marshall didn't dispute that at all. In fact he got one year for attempted murder, and was allowed to remain in the army where he retired. As for Drug use at the time, pretty much par for the course as anyone in and around the army can tell you. Seeing senior and junior officers continually drunk, or whatever, while on duty during that period was common."
1,Expired cartridge,No where in the ad did it say this inkjet cartridge expired 9/11. I'm not very happy about that. Would like to get a headsup if I'm buying an expired item.
4,SOME OF-The Best of James Hall,"I know it is impossible to put all of the best song by James hall on one CD. But how can you forget about Anita Wells and Tanesha Crispell! But for all of us who has been following James from the beginning, this CD is something to carry along to keep the classics in good condition. Next time when you want to do another Best of, how about doing it LIVE and do a video. OverAll I recommend this CD, especially for the new James Hall Listeners. You'll Love it!"
4,Sid Meier's Pirates! Live the Life,"Very fun game, the graphics are pretty good too, basically the same gameplay throughout the game, but still a great game."
4,A fine book for regular readers of contemporary poetry,"Fine, fine poems. Definitely NOT cheap, vulgar, mean-spirited or disgusting, as another reader found them. And not a tract on the ten commandments in any hyper-religious sense (not a theological book, obviously)."
1,What a Bummer,"I bought this scanner on the internet. Iv'e had nothing but problems. From the looks of the reviews other people have had the same. The scanner hasn't worked properly since the day I got it. Images scan but show up with vertical lines that run the legnth of the document. Trying to ""save as"" scanned documents produces error dialog. The disc seems to be currupt, because it was impossible to load Photo Suite that came with the unit. Not to mention the unit is slow. I invested a great deal of time between e-mailing and reading at their tech support site, No Help. I waited on the phone 35 minutes to talk to a tech, who told me to try fixes I was aready aware of, or already tried. Oh, here's the best part, guess who gets to pay the shipping for the return? Thats right yours truly. I was told I'd be reimbursed. We'll see. God, I should have checked the reviews first. This things going back in a hurry."
1,Wish I could scan something!,I bought a Visioneer 7600 USB One Touch scanner and have yet to be able to scan anything! The install goes smoothly or so one thinks. You connect and it appears to be fine. I attempt to scan an image and it only scans a black dark image. I do my leg work and research to find updated drivers and do at the Visioneer support site and the update crashes my computer! I've tried install fixes per other forums and message boards and nothing works. I can install just fine and it LOOKS like it's going to work lovely but still - just the black dark images. Oh btw - I am running Windows 98 SE - seems to be the key here. Wondering - was this scanner only made for one operating system - Windows 98!?! Not a wise choice for your money.P.S. Would appreciate anyone emailing me if they know the fix for this problem of mine! TY gypsyfw@prodigy.net
2,"Showed promise, but in the end...","With great glibness, the saleperson said it would be ""a snap"". In fact, it proved to be unreliable (defective product, or typical of the line?). I would not recommend this. I returned it three days later."
1,NOT for Sensitive Skin,"Although I'd read great reviews of this product for people with sensitive skin, it was anything but good. I do not have overly sensitive skin, but I do need fragrance free moisturizers. This moisturizer not only dried out my skin but made my eyelids (where I did not apply the moisturizer) crack and peel.While I understand that everyone responds to facial creams differently, I would think twice before using this moisturizer if you've had issues with sunscreens in the past.I ended up getting rid of it after about a week and using something much, much better."
5,Perfect,Gorgeous. It's lightweight and seems really durable. Works perfectly. Pops right in. Flush connector works much better than shoving a hose up the drain! Perfect shipping as always from Amazon. Thanks!
2,Yikes! Not as good as the movie.,"There is a shallowness in Nance's books that's difficult to fathom for a so-called best-selling author. I saw the movie version first, thought the book would have more depth and interest. Well, just the opposite to extent that's possible. More caricatures than characters, weird social bias, etc. His books leave me feeling like I need a shower."
3,Good mouse but stinky!,"The mouse works well for gaming and practical use, but after prolonged use, the area around the logo absorbs sweat and moisture. After about six months, the palm on my hand began to stink every time I used the mouse. I am a clean-freak and even after cleaning the mouse for a good month with various cleaning products, the smell would creep back.Overall I recommend the mouse in terms of everyday use, but if a stinky hand bothers you, this isn't the mouse for you."
3,no so happy,I play a shooting game and you have to have continuously fast repeatative clicks and they all do not register (and no I am not missing the targets). For regular computer work it's fine. but this is a gaming mouse!
3,MX-518 recommendation,I bought this mouse about 4 years back it wasn't the metal model though. I thought this would be the best mouse. But I found out it is too small for my hands. So I went back online and bought a G7 it is a much better feel. It is also cordless wich helps in fps's.
3,"Was no better than my laser ""mini mouse"" for gaming",This may work with a multitude of games on the net today but came up way short for my Golden Tee Golf application.
4,Worth the money,It works with all function in all my programs. The mouse arrow does not run across the screen as with my optical mouse 3000 did. It did take time for it to feel right as I use it with my left hand.
5,Great Mouse,"I was honestly amazed with this when I received this in the mail. It was all I expected and more. On top of the comfortable grips and design, this mouse was top quality in terms of performance. The optical illusion of a hard, dented metal plate hides the smooth, well-crafted plastic going from the back to the clickers. The additional buttons are great as well. As default, the buttons on the left side are back and forward buttons for browsing the internet. However, with the software that comes with it, you can customize the function of the buttons to any key or command that you choose. Now, whenever I use a different mouse, at say, school or a friend's house, it feels . . . lacking, and uncomfortable. While there are other optical mice out there for lower prices, this one is well worth the money. It does not skip to the corner of the screen like any cheap optical mouse would, with fast reactions and customizable features, I highly recommend this product."
5,Very pleased,I had read the reviews of this mouse prior to buying it. It had gotten very good reviews. Ive ben playing with it for about a month now and i find it meets all my needs and then some. Highly recommend it.
3,Don't Buy Sight Unseen,"I have tried many different models of the Logitech mouse and have found them all to be seriously lacking. This gaming mouse could be a great device but you can't buy it sight unseen. It is too much of a gamble. I tried using it but it doesn't fit my hand at all. I either can't reach the button on the side of it or it becomes impossible to reach the ones in front. My husband tried using it too, and discovered that it didn't fit his hand either. I'm sure there are people whose hands it fits perfectly but this is something you can only find out after trying it out at the store.If you are a gamer, the only reason to get this mouse is to be able to improve your speed. This becomes impossible if your hand is either a little too small or a little too big for this mouse. Also, it looks quite different from the product image. It is quite slippery and looks flimsy. I don't think we will be using it much."
5,The Ultimate Mouse,"After 4 years of pure abuse (at least 10 hours at day, gaming -mainly fps- and graphic/web design)it's still working perfectly!Like every Logitech product, it's built like a tank and lasts eternally. Definitively my favorite brand.A must have for gamers and designers, and it's a lot cheaper but as powerful and precise as any current model, totally recommended.This thing will outlive me :P"
2,"BAD location for ""back"" and ""forward"" buttons...","There is nothing more frustrating, then to spend precious time, entering data on a web page, only to go grab your mouse, and hit that ridiculously placed ""back"" button, only to have your progress wiped out, and have to do it all over again. I can't tell you how much of a pain that button placement has caused me. On top of that, the design is a bit off, it's not quite that great fitting, it leaves my thumb aching, and I'm not doing any gaming!! Give me a good 'ol fashion mouse with the simple 3 main buttons on it!"
4,comfortable,"With my big hands, its hard to find a comfortable mouse. The standard ones give my hands cramps. This one isn't terribly big, but contoured enough to be good for me. Everything else works just fine too..."
5,THE BEST!,"This mouse has lasted for over a year and I have absolutely no regrets. I bang it around and it keeps on working. Logitech still reins supreme when it comes to making the best mouse for your computer, gaming or not. The mouse feels so comfortable and compatible with my (right) hand and the Back and Forward buttons situated where your thumb goes is perfect for surfing the Net. Be aware though, this mouse is not for those who use the mouse with their left hand."
5,Awesome Product,"This Logitech mouse is yet my best mouse among all other mice that I owned. Although I am not a gamer, I'm sure the gamers would agree with me for its precise movement and agility. Another A+ product from Logitech. Congratulations!"
2,Great mouse except that the buttons keep breaking,"The switching dpi on the fly works great and is really cool, although the front button in front of the wheel is not easy to access. It fits nicely in your hand. I like the mouse to be a little higher than some of the ""pure"" gaming mice. Only problem is i have had 2 break in the last 5 months. The first stopped being able to click one of the top buttons. The second had a similar problem where if you pressed the button too hard it would unclick itself, even though you hadn't let go of it. I certainly wouldn't buy another one of these if i had the opportunity again. Oh, and metal is the color, not what it is made of."
2,Lemon not up to the hype but is ok,"Had a previous version MX500 and was very happy for years. This is pretty much just the same mouse. Interface used to update the speed is straight forward until you get to the advanced settings, just have to figure it out. The lemon comes because of the scroll, mine skips. 1 out of 3 scrolls gets picked up and feels more rough than my previous mouse. I am sure others might be ok but now I have to just live with it or go through the hassle of returning it. No real impressive gaming differences at all from my MX500. Playing Medal of Honor made no difference with this new mouse really, for me it was just time for a new one so I purchased this. If on the fence because you think this will improve gaming don't buy, if you need a new mouse because your old one is shot this is still a great mouse. I just hope your scroll works better than mine. Would be better priced at $19.99"
2,"For a gaming mouse, I hate it.","I play golf on my computer a lot. The mouse is an integral part of making a shot and my old mouse (standard wired mouse received with computer) just wasn't working correctly. To start and stop a shot, the mouse is clicked. If the mouse doesn't start and stop exactly when clicked, the shot goes awry. This logitech mouse, for some reason, doesn't detect the clicks even 80% of the time and I have tried numerous different settings with no success. I wouldn't recommend it to even a novice gamer."
2,Get the G5 Instead,I love Logitecs products. This one is a disapointment though. My wife got me one for christmas. Its slipery. Its too small. Its painful to use for long periods of time. The DPI sensitivity buttons are placed poorly. Its frustrating when you accidentaly push those sensitity buttons.
5,Perfect Gaming Mouse,"Whether it is World of Warcraft or Battlefield 2, this mouse glides perfectly to its destination. I've been an Gamer for some time now, and can categorically say that I have not ever encountered a better mouse. The pixel adjustment is precise, allowing you to aim quickly and accurately whereas the alternate keys on the side make throwin grenades or using secondary fire a breeze. Finally, there is a button on the actual mouse that allows you to switch between screens so if you aren't a gamer, you can easily swap projects on your desktop. Past all of this, the design is extremely comfortable, allowing your thumb to lock into the mouse in a way, and providing better control. The right and left mouse buttons click easily and accurately as well.Whether you're a gamer or a graphic designer, this mouse is the mouse for you. Haven't found a use yet that this mouse hasn't made quicker/easier."
4,Will work for 2 years.,"This is my third MX518, and will buy one more in two years, I say two years because this is a great mouse, but as others have said, over time the buttons will wear out. get it, you'll live it a lot."
4,Good.,"Good mice for me. Smooth scroll, quiet nice in handle. Good mice for this price.I have it just over one month and no problem."
1,Out of the box Never worked!,"My son was so exited to recieve this from Santa this past Christmas. Major disappointment! Removed from the packaging and put new batteries in but nothing worked. After talking to customer service at Young Explorers I was told they had a number of people call about this toy not working. They issued a refund and placed an order for a new one. Expected delivery was mid January. My son asks daily if ""Santa's elves"" have finished making his new robot and checks the mail regularly. Today Jan 30 I recieved a card from YE explaining that the expected due date is now June 10! Tell me how to explain this to a 5 year old! So agravating!!"
4,A Thoughtful Reflection on Catholicism for Grown Ups,"If your rage is always ready to boil over, if you need to think of yourself as a Catholic but really despise most human beings, if blind obedience makes you feel really smart and snide, this is certainly not the book for you. But if you have persisted in believing that Catholicism has mainly to do with love, if human beings searching for wisdom and peace of heart touch your heart, if you've been needing some reassurance lately that emotional maturity and Catholic faith really are deeply compatible, then this book might give you solace, courage, patience, even smiles. Remember: even Jesus sometimes felt like calling the furiously self-righteous & those who suffer from irrational certitude -- ""hypocrites,"" ""brood of vipers,"" and ""whitewashed tombs."" This winter too will turn into spring."
1,Bring your crystals,"In the old days when people no longer believed in what the Catholic Church taught, they had the honesty to leave and either: a)join no church; 2) join another church; 3) start their own...hey, it's a free country! Unfortunately, the author is one of those people still claiming to be ""Catholic"" but who wants nothing to do with Catholic dogma and Catholic ethics.The result is a slick piece of spiritual consumerism for the upper middle-class: creedless, rule-less, but with plenty of spiritual warm fuzzies to help your self-esteem. Catholicism it's not.If you want the real thing, buy a rosary instead."
3,eh..,"My first thought when I took it out of the packaging was ""Are you kidding me?"". But I thought that maybe even if the book was very small that it would be worth the $20 that I paid. Yes, there is some useful information that I may have had trouble finding somewhere else but the truth is, I have read a lot of this stuff online already so yes, I was a bit disappointed. I was looking to find something specific to malt-i-poos since it appears to be practically non-existent. Yes, I'm going to keep it since I am sure I can refer to it here and there without having to sign online and google the info BUT mostly, because I don't want to avoid the hassle of returns. If you want a quick, brief, guide this is ok."
1,A picture book,I was looking for specific info on my new puppy.This was a photo album of malti poos.I paid $22 for a book full of pictures of other peoples dogs.Not happy
3,General information about this book,It is written in Spanish and has the English translations. There are 20 pages of information about Tijuana followed by 42 black and white photographs documenting the year 1964 in that area.Put together nicely.
3,Buyer beware,Be very cautious when purchasing printer cartridges. I recently purchased an HP 58 cartridge through Amazon. It was printing photos with a very noticeable green tint. A test page revealed the light magenta was not printing correctly. I tried cleaning the print head and contacts to no avail. I ended up purchasing another cartridge from a local office supply. It works fine. That's when I noticed an expiration date on the box and cartridge. The one purchased locally had an expiration date in 2012. The one I purchased through Amazon had an expiration date in mid-2009. It was over a year past the expiration date when I received it. MAKE SURE YOU LOOK AT THE DATE ON THE BOX BEFORE YOU OPEN IT!!!
4,"Not too bad, but could have been better.","""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"" probably has one of the cheesiest ""special effects"" from ""Star Trek""....Bele's ""invisible"" ship. They could've saved themselves alot of embarrassment by saying, ""It's cloaked"". Other that, that, the message is desperately needed for today."
2,Not as promised and missing 4 of 25 folders,"The box was missing four of the 25 promised folders. The folders did not have the ""Infopocket"" either. Other reviewers have also noticed this."
2,No Infopocket,"The folders I received did not have the Infopocket as described. Seemed okay otherwise, but I returned them because I want the Infopocket type."
5,Magnificent,"Words fail to describe this collection, no doubt one of Airto's finest (the world's best percussionist, in case you don't know). Raw, wild, refined, tender. Unlike anything else I've heard. The unrestrained passion (or is it madness?) of Ruben Rada's vocal on Meni Devol is unbelievable. Celebration Suite will lift your spirits and your feet from the floor. Remarkable stuff, and thank the stars it's available on CD now."
4,Christmas for Jessica,"I've always enjoyed Sweet Valley Twin books, but the special editions in particular. This book was fun and exciting. Like in ""A Christmas Carol,"" Jessica is shown the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future. We learn a lot about Jessica's personality, and a lot about her life. I think it's a great book, especially since it's the Holiday season. This book will probably get you ""in the spirit."" While I don't think it's very scary at all, it's a great Christmas story. And as usual, it shows the strong bond between two great sisters."
2,low quality products,"I bought it from amazon, which i trust the best; however, I make me so disappointed after I received the product. So low quality products. YOU can spend the same price in office depose near you for a much better one."
4,Pendaflex Hanging folder,"These file folders are hard to find in this color. I was looking for the ones that had the pockets inside, but this was the closest I could find."
4,Prince Valiant,I brought this product as I watched the TV series as a kid and remember it being pretty good. Overall the series is pretty good although I got tired of it after about half way through.The series promotes very good values and is definately something kids will enjoy. The actual packaging and the quality of the dvds are also very good.
5,Straight-Shootin' Advice for GI's,Paul Allen Keys is a straight-shooter - and I like that! He gives valuable and helpful advice about the Korean bar scene and does it with a touch of humor. He's trying to advise the GI's on how NOT to blow all their hard-earned money on bargirls. Paul is dealing with serious subjects in a light-hearted manner. His book is like a AAA tour book for lonely GI's looking for a good time.
3,Arrived quickly,A very slow read and pretty depressing. Vocabulary difficult - maybe common in South Africa.
4,incredible,"powerful tracks from an awesome figure. i remember a quote that said something like ""the job of the artist is to make revolution irresistible."" kuti is the greatest embodiment of this i've come across."
4,Encouragement.,"Being a Minister's Wife - Being Yourself: a great book1 Positive, encouraging, honest, uplifting! Wish I had read this book before becoming a Pastor's Wife."
5,I use it almost every week!,"This is a well used and most appreciated addition to my cookbook library. I use it nearly every week. I can make old standbys for my kids and more 'grown up' pizzas for my husband and myself. Most recipes are fast and easy, and the results are great. Pizza is more that the usual cheese and tomato creations we're used to, and Mr. Food shows us how to enjoy all that variety while still having a life."
2,Unhappy with toy!,When I received this toy I was very unhappy. For the price I paid it was smaller than the picture and doesn't even look like the dog in the picture. My 10 month old barely plays with it. I love the softness of the toy and I love Gund toys but this was a bust!!!!
3,"Wanting a seduction from Lefcourt, we only get a smooch.","Lord knows I want to love The Woody, just as I wanted to love the three previous novels I read by Lefcourt, covering such potential outlandish topics from saving Di to foreplay in the infield. But Lefcourt is such a charming writer, that I let myself be seduced by the cover with each book and end up feeling unfulfilled 300 pages later.Why? Lefcourt is great at setting up hilarious situations and then blowing them off one by one. A great comedy writer relishes getting his characters into such situations and then milking them. Lefcourt barely grabs the teat before he's off to the next episode.Peter! I love you, but go back and read how Thorne Smith got it right. (By the way, I'll still buy your next book.)Roger Morris"
1,The Fendi Watch that ran for only 15 days,"Watch came as promised. Given a week later for Christmas. Ran for 15 days, and now I cannot use US Fendi dealers and must get an International Warranty and who knows where it will get fixed or how long it will take. So much for a watch that supposedly costs $1200 retail and runs for only two weeks!"
3,Not as good as I was hoping,"So the little utensils inside are just fine. My son does love playing with them. My problem is with the packaging. The little doctor's bag has split in many corners and we've only had it for a few months. My son is not rough with the bag, so I am surprised it hasn't lasted longer. the fact that it is ripping (and will probbaly split in two within the next 6 months) makes me want to buy a whole other set. I'll probably just get a cheap artist's kaddy and put the doctor toys in there."
2,Not what I expected!,"I was very disappointed with the quality of the case. It is thin, weak plastic. I know it will not last long at all."
3,A disappointment,"I approached this book with keen anticipation. The topic looked promising and the writer, according to the cover blurb, has ""the allure of a poet and the clarity of a scientist"". Which serves as a reminder never to believe cover blurbs.I have to admit that I did not read the whole book, not even most of it, and that is unusual for me. I found it to be so badly written that I couldn't maintain focus. Anecdotes that might have been pure delight were bland and meaningless. I'm appalled that this woman is teaching English at the university level. Part of the problem is that she overuses short sentences and even short paragraphs and this robs the text of continuity.The writer appears too have done a great deal of research. It would have been better for the reader if she had handed it all over to someone who could have made an interesting book out of it."
3,butterfly book,"Bought it as a present. Flipped through it, slightly. No illustrations, but seems very informal."
5,Pine ridge camera mount,"Im using this camera arm with a digial camera.It mounted easy to the tree and remains sturdy with the camera mounted even in high wind. My only wish is that it moved verticaly as well as horizontally, but the swing arm has work great for me to capture deer feeding below my treestand.Waiting to capture the harvet."
3,"""okay"" product","This product works very well when you wait the 60 seconds for it to calibrate. Unfortunately, the product does not aways calibrate so i have to take out the batteries and put them back in place to reset the device. For the price, it is not a bad product, but it does not perform the way it is supposed to."
3,Red Hot Chili Pipers First Album,If you like the Chilli Pipers you will like this although it is not as good as the recording of their live performance.
1,Sorry to Break the Chain of Great Reviews,"Perhaps it is because I expected pop or folk music, but I was extremely disappointed with this CD. Being a writer, I can certainly appreciate someone wanting to write a tribute to their partner, but these lyrics would have been better published as a book of poetry or prose. The music is annoying, and the singing voice is mechanical and forced. It doesn't flow. A very amatuer effort. In short, the lyrics are good, but the music left a lot to be desired. For good grrrrlfriendly folk music, you would be better served to check out the Indigo Girls."
2,Poor quality DVDs,"I completely agree with the previous reviewers and wish I had read them before purchasing from this seller. The DVD disc quality is POOR at best. The picture quality is grainy and at least 2 episodes ""lose"" their English translation. The English translation in an of itself is absolutely POOR. Discounting the numerous spelling errors and typographical errors, the translation is incorrect many times. Another reviewer gave more details on examples of the poor translation. Also, in 2 episodes, the picture freezes in multiple segments. I do not know why this seller, Rolling Donut, continues to carry this product. Can they not obtain a good quality DVD AND fire the currently company providing the English subtitles/translation?"
3,It's okay,"I wanted to like this book a lot more than I did, but in the end, it's just another internet information marketing book. If you read Dan Kennedy, Joe Vitale and others like them, you won't find anything new here. As a matter of fact, Joe Vitale is in this book."
5,Favorite horror novel ever,"In the interest of full disclosure I must admit that I know and greatly admire the author. However, that does not mean I can not be objective.Mr. Harris wrote a novel that scared me like no other, and yet the structure and symbolism were more like that often seen in great and classical works of fiction.It is a story of a young boy in a rural Georgia town who comes to understand who/what he is. From terrifying and suspense-filled bathtubs to a tree house providing sanctuary to those willing to climb a ladder, this novel filled my mind with imagery and thought provoking feelings like no other.... Nevertheless, Deliver Us From Evil had me checking my back and cautiously glancing around a brightly lit room full of people in the middle of the day.Enjoy."
2,:(,Wasnt that great. Lots of info but poorly laid out. Not well written. Looks good in the preview but a real dissappointment when you get it. I recomend DIY(design it yourself). Its far more professional and useful.
1,Looks like it was printed on someone's copier.,"First off, the author uses curly fonts that are difficult to read, and a cheesy layout that makes the book look like it was laid out in a spreadsheet program. The name lists themselves are pretty short; only a page for some ethnicities. There's not a whole lot of detailed information. You could do better (and save yourself some cash) by searching for names on the internet."
1,Frustration at its peak!,"I was attracted to this book by the picture of the hibiscus origami flowers on the front, never mind the saying, ""don't judge a book by its cover."" Well, I should have listened. the folds and lines were very confusing. the designs were nice and attractive, but this book made it tough to achieve the beautiful goals. attracted initially by the hibiscus, i immediately tried to make that, having previous experience in origami, i thought i could handle it. the diagram was a mess of dots, dashes, arrows, and lines. i could not, try as i might, make that blasted hibiscus. i haven't picked up the book since, except to hold it in my lap now as i write this review for reference.designs:aloha shirt(nice, pretty easy), volcano, humuhumunukunukuapua'a, anthurium, hibiscus(AAAAAAHHHHHHH!), plumeria, marlin, gecko, snow king protea, orchid(looks tough), hula dancer(also hard), double hull canoe, bird of paradise, torch ginger.do not buy this book. it is thoroughly vexing."
3,didn't even use it,I wish I'd spent the money for this book on something else. I never even cracked it open. It is very easy to get around in Germany without it--even a single traveler with no real plan in mind can communicate with relative ease. I'd probably only need this book if I were taking a German Language class.
2,Not as expected,"I will eagerly tell anyone to read the Snow Queen or Catspaw, but I cannot recommend this book. I was expecting another rich story set in the world of Tiamat, but was rewarded with just an average detective/buddy novel. This story could take place anywhere, at any time, just by plugging in different dates. Many things hinted at in the story are not developed enough, and it left a taste of promise unfulfilled. Vinge is a talented storyteller but this book comes across as a rushed contractual obligation."
1,garbage,"This book is the most ridiculous book I have ever read on real estate investing. With over 200+ books on the subject in our library and attending over 100 seminars, I have to say...dont waste your money on this one."
2,Mama can do better,"Although I'm a fan of Mama and Simone, I didn't rate this book much.Whilst the central character and her family are engaging and well drawn, I found the plot (which needs to work in a detective novel) rather disappointing. The start was intriguing, and the mystery of the vanished girl certainly made me want to read on, but the solution was too much of a coincidence to convince. ... And the side drama(the death of Mama's cousin) just petered out.Plus some sloppy editing causing confusion with the girls' names, and the result was a read that wasn't as good as it could (and should ) have been.I'll read some more books by this author because I've read some by her that were better than this one, but still.Mama can do better!"
1,not good,It might have worked for Jay but I securely hooked it up to my gate - no instructions provided but you figure its easy. I hooked it up nice and tight and the darn metal bracket just swung around and the gate fell to the ground and I again have a gate that drags on the ground - waste of money
1,"Manikkomio went from ""Mambo"" to singing boricuarengue : (","Manikkomio, on their fist cd had mambo. On their second cd the had boricuarengue and no mambo at all. I didn't like this change. It was like they were trying to be like Elvis Crespo or something. I am through with maniKKomio bye"
5,Chocolate Goodness,"Two words: Freaking Tasty. Quite the synopsis eh? Upon unwrapping this ambrosia of the gum gods, you're left with one question: How do I hide this from my coworkers.Good luck"
2,It brokes the first time a move it!,"The joint in the back came so tight, so when i move it it brokes! The size is great, it looks great materials, but now i have to put it in the trash, because the metal joint is broken."
4,Great view,"I transport troubled children so I need a good view of all in the vehicle. This gives a great view, The suction cup did not work well and the stem busted. We attached it to the rear mirror and it worked great."
1,Don't buy! Poorly made!,"The mirror is great. The suction cup works great too. But there is a piece that holds the mirror and suction that breaks so easily. Not even a real metal. Shank that connects the adjustment ball to the back of the mirror is pot metal. I agree with the other person (Mark Schoeppel) that gave this mirror 1 star. I tried to adjust it and align it. Yup! it snapped right off in half. TRUE! I regret buying this piece of ****! Don't buy. If you do, just be careful adjusting. Its neck will break."
5,like having eyes in the back of your head,"I looked at all the other mirrors advertised and reviewed. Most mirrors are for cars and are made out of plastic with a reflective coating and don't give a great image. I believe this mirror might actually made of glass. I don't know if mirrors for cars cannot be made of glass due to regulations but I guess it does not apply to this product because it is for a boat. I use it in an RV because the RV has no rearview mirror. I needed a way to keep and eye on the kids without turning around. The field of view is perfect. The suction cup worked perfect and stayed on the windshield even when left up for several weeks. In side the accordian rubber boot is a series of nuckles to get the perfect bend and you can tighten the nuckles if you you need to. Over all this mirror worked perfect. Not only is this a value, but I could not find another mirror at any price that would do what I needed to do."
4,"Geat Mirror, but ...","Let me clarify I don't use this on a boat. I use it to eliminate the blind spot in my car.This is a great mirror -- that is, if you can get it installed properly.It's huge, not only it eliminated the blind spot on the right side of my car. I can actually see my kids on the rear seat clearly. Well, the one on the left side might still be able to hide right behind your seat. But the one on the other side has nowhere to hide except to go all the way to the floor.But installation is problematic. The sucking cup doesn't work, which is more or less expected. My Acura TL has a small tab on the ceiling where you can clip your garage door opener, I am able to squeeze the rubber cup into the tab and it stays there just fine. But if you can't find a good place to install in your car, this mirror is pretty much useless."
3,Building acoustic guitars,"I have recently been bitten by the guitar bug. Particularly assembly and design of guitars. This is a great source of information to the anyone that builds guitars. The information is clear, concise and easy to follow. It is a well balanced, easy to comprehend resource."
4,Excellent,"Mr. Kinkead has written an excellent book. Great pictures and, for the most part, clear explanations. A few places leave you scratching your head for awhile. The most serious problem with this book is that he gives no directions on how to make any of the templates or jigs he uses during the various stages of construction, with the exception of the body mold. The plans for the dovetail jig for the neck/body joint would have been extremely helpful.The weakest area of the book, probably because it's the most complex, is the neck construction.But for these shortcomings, I would have given the book 5 stars. I would advise buying other books, such as Cumpiano's, to suplement Kinkead's."
3,Not a bad game,"This is a O.K game . It has really good graphics . My favorite level is when you go through a maze to help out Alice , from Alice in wonderland this is an awsome game especially at the end . There is a BIG SURPRISE!!!!"
4,Works well,"Initial review is very good. Item is easy to use and appears to be made of good quality. Clear communications and compact size aa plus. Once I hit the slopes, I report back."
3,Okay Buy,"This game is wonderful for those who are young and for those who are just bored. I haven't gotten into the whole game so far, but I can already judge that this game is one of those of which you pull out to play when you're bored. I'm not saying customers shouldn't pick up this title. Although this game has many fun and unique levels, it can get repetitive quickly. I give it a 3 out of 5. For those of you who enjoy this game very much, I support your opinions as well. Have fun playing!"
3,Not very fun on computer,"I bought Disney Universe because it was half off, and while it is a fun game, it would be even better with more than one player. The download version, as far as I have figured, can only be played with one player due to the nature of being played on a computer. Some of the levels are difficult with only one player."
2,"Terrible Recording, please look elsewhere...","Although Sylvia McNair sings beautifully as Anitra and Sloveig, Tate doesn't conduct well, and the Berlin Philharmonic sounds very emotionally detached from this piece. The Hall of the Mountain King sounds terrible. The recording also suffers from poor editing, you hear the trolls yelling after the big closing notes at the end of inside the Hall of the Mountain King when they should have left out that annoying part. In any case, any recording with the choral parts is better than the watered down orchestral only Peer Gynt suites. I love Grieg's music, but this is just a poor performance. You get what you pay for!"
5,Her Best Book,"This is Sandra Brown at her best! The twists keep coming and the bad guy is as bad as they come. The heroine Maris Matherly Reed, an editor, is intrigued by the first chapter of a book sent to her by an writer who goes by the initials ""PME"". She tracks him down and visits him on his remote island home, finding ""PME"" to be more intriguing than the book. Confused by her feelings, she returns home to her husband Noah, only to find that things were not what she believed them to be and that ""PME"" and Noah have a past. She must find out the truth before it is too late!"
5,Amazing!,"I absolutely LOVE this book. I have read a lot of Sandra Brown's suspense novels and this one is by far one of the best ones (Chill Factor coming in 1st). I am not going to tell you what it is about because of all of the other entries, but I want to tell you how great it is. It is a fast-paced, drama-filled book with just a slight, prefect bit of romance I am sure you will love. I hope this helps and you pick this book up!"
5,The Very Best of Sandra Brown,"The characters are worth knowning (most of them) and the ones that are not make the story the terrific suspense that it becomes. Maris Matherly-Reed is a successful editor. Her father is the owner, as was his family before him, of the publishing house that Maris works for. Her husband is the No. 2 man in the publishing house having ingratiated himself with Maris' father and then having married Marris. Marris has only begun to suspect that her husband might not be all that he seems to be when she receives a prologue to a manuscript from a writer who identifies himself only as P.M.E.Marris becomes intrigued with the prologue and sets off to find the author and as she becomes involved with the story of the book we find that ""Envy"" is a book within a book within another book. There is a relationship between the mysterious author and her husband Noah. The plot of both ""books"" is beautifully crafted and a must read from cover to cover."
5,A new favorite,This was my first Sandra Brown novel and I am excited to read more. I loved this story and couldn't put it down!
5,Next Box Office Hit!,"I listen to a lot of books on tape while traveling back and forth to work. I thought this book was GREAT! Not only did the narrator have a terrific voice, but the story captured your interest in the first few pages. I didn't want to pull into my driveway when I reached my home. Personally, I think this would make a great movie."
2,Not A Great Read,"Call me a sour old cow, but looking at the reviews here I realize that I am one of the few that hated this book; perhaps I am the only one who hated it with a passion. This book cemented the fact that I will never purchase another Sandra Brown novel. Her plots are getting really ""out there""--for the lack of a better term--and her writing is not strong enough to make these out there plots plausible. And I was neither offended or aroused by her sex scenes; I am used to the so-called ""vulgarity"" of them and they seem to be written purely for shock value and have gotten downright classless. Ms. Brown has also, of late, been sacrificing character development to support her ludicrous plots...only to provide you with her TWO PAGE ending, which is so damn predictable, you wonder why you bother. If you ask me, I was infinitely more interested in Parker's novel than Ms. Brown's!"
3,Good But Not Great,It was pretty decent it has some compelling moments. But rauchiness of the book left at lot to be desire.
2,A bit of a disappointment,"I have read many of her books and this one disappointed me. It was ok, but definitely not the top of her game."
3,"Good, but not great","I just finished reading Envy. I really enjoyed the novel within a novel format, but didn't find it as an exciting a read as Switch which I couldn't put down. I wouldn't rate it as high as many of her other novels."
5,I simply love it!!!,"This book really changed my view of Brown's books. I have stopped reading Brown's book since last year because i find it very superficial. It really made her writing style seem shallow. I decided to give Envy a try when i saw it on the bookshelf. i wasn't expecting much from it but Envy really surprised me. Although i haven't finish the book, i know that i will definitely enjoy it because i am enjoying it even now. This book has the depth that the other books have been sadly lacking in. And this is exactly what made me want to go on reading it. I started this book without even reading the sypnosis or any reviews because i want to be be objective about this. I didn't expect anything but i was rewarded by a terrific storyline which truly surprised me. So please do give this book a try because it's really very well written."
4,One of my favorite books!,"Love the author, love the book. This book is passionate and written by a great woman! She knows how to keep you interested the entire time, and how to throw in multiple twists to keep you guessing. Highly suggest it!"
5,Envy review,"The book arrived quickly, condition was as advertised and was packaged well. As usual, Sandra Brown delivers a compelling, well-structured mystery with good characters."
2,Predictable,"Read the first 80 pages of this book and had it all figured out. There wasn't any surprise ending, flipped to the last 30 pages to confirm all my suspicions. Was very disappointed. She is going the way of Danielle Steel."
4,Definitely worth reading,"This is an entertaining and honest read. I really enjoyed the writing style. This book focusses more on the life of a FAC than the actual flying of the missions. Fans of DaNang Diary and A Lonely Kind of War might be disappointed to find much less in the way of the white knuckle accounts of hostile engagements, but anyone interested in the people who fought the war can't fail but to be impressed with this book."
5,Great book..,"Great book, reminded me of stories my Dad told me about his tours in Vietnam. Made me proud of him and ALL Vet's again. Thank you to all."
3,No InfoPockets,"The Product Description says it has ""interior InfoPocket—this ""file-in-a-file"" holds CDs, photo, memos, business cards and more"" and the picture shows InfoPockets. However, both times I ordered these (10/2011 and 12/2012), the folders I received DO NOT have InfoPockets. (I did receive the correct model # 4152.)These are better quality (reinforced at bottom and top) than other cheaper ones, but I was really paying more in order to get the InfoPockets."
1,Autocool doesn't work-waste of money,"I bought two of these and tried them on my car in Northern CA. The fan is so weak I doubt that it could keep anything the size of the smallest auto one degree cooler than an equal car without the autocool. I tried two of the autocool fans separately and together, the ambient temperature was 85 degrees, after 1 hour the inside of my car was 98 degrees with two autocools working. What they don't tell you is it doesn't work if you have tinted glass. No where in the TV ads or website Ads nor on the box do they mention this, only inside the box in the instructions. A Sacramento TV station did a comparison of two identical vehicles one with the autocool and each heated up to 118 degrees, no difference was observed. [...]."
5,A sweet tribute to moms,I'm a longtime fan of Anthony Browne's books and this one is probably my favorite. The illustrations are lovely and it's a very sweet-natured book.
5,Just what I was hoping for,"This was exactly what I was looking for. I was kind of leery about buying it after reading another review on here about it, who claimed that it photographed white for them. But I did not have this problem. I actually used this to shoot 13 children who were wearing white shirts and it definitely had a contrast against the background. The product does match the swatch that's shown pretty well. It's kind of like a light tannish-gray, which is what I wanted. This was the first time I used a paper backdrop and I really like it. It's a thick quality paper, but just make sure you're not using it on carpet because paper on soft surfaces with people or furniture on top- not a good idea."
1,Fun game!!,"While these are very easy for adults to remove, unfortunately they were also very easy for my 14 month old to remove, and it was excellent entertainment for him until I was able to replace them with regular old flat ones that are tough for me to pry out."
1,How would you call this safe!!!,"Amazon should take this off the list. This is a scam and these are useless plugs. They have a meaningless spring type button in the middle and they have a side thickness which makes then so easy to pull off. My 7 month old son made it a game to pull these off, I can't tell you how annoyed you get and stressed you get..."
4,how to test almost everything electronic,"ordered this book, got it fast. excellent reference book. So good I just ordered another one for a retiring friend."
4,Excellent for group counseling DUI,"This video can be an interesting set up for several DUI group topics such as affects, laws, and a good eye openers for teens."
4,Helpful small novel,"This little book is a detective novel meant for students of Spanish. It uses Castillian Spanish (European). The realistic dialogue with common idioms and current slang makes it especially appropriate for young learners. The plot, characters, and resolution are not particularly well developed, but they are not the intent of the writer. The book's main purpose is to teach the language, which it does quite well."
5,Read is Good,"Hoenig offers readers what he offers listeners: a rock and roll guide to money and life. With inspirations from Letterman to Rukeyser, Maus to Buffett (Warren, not Jimmy), Michael Brady to Michael Price, Hoenig finds a way to inspire smart behavior -- saving, investing, grabbing for knowledge and life with both hands -- by wrapping common sense and insight in a tasty package of loud irreverence. Hoenig might be the only finance author that attracts backstage groupies. He might be the only finance author that deserves them."
3,"Really a ""Dummies Guide""","There's nothing really wrong with this book, but there's nothing really good about it, either -- it's more or less a ""Dummies' Guide"" targeted at twentysomethings. Stick with more established authors (and advice) if you're a beginner, and get something smarter if you're not."
1,Offensive!,"The author tries so hard to relate to fellow Gen Xers that he ends up littering the book with cynacism and offensive phrases. For example, he explains that ""Black Monday"" refers to the day the stock market crashed, not the TV entertainment lineup. And, that's just where it starts. Buy another book, even if the author is over 24."
5,Great taste - low sodium,This marinade has a great mesquite taste and is easy to use. It takes less time than most to really take effect. There is also no match I have found for the low sodium count.
5,Terence Trent D'Arby (Sananda Maitreya) - In Concert,"Fantastic concert from 1987. Filmed on a german TV show Showcasing his first CD Hardline. All i can say get this DVD. He is in top form in this video and still is(saw him live in 2003). Can't wait till they release a more recent concert! Also check out his ""Wildcard"" CD simply incredible. His website: www.sanandamaitreya.com for more info."
5,delightful ...,"Tokyo Godfathers is a comical and touching story about three homeless friends and their quest to find an abandoned baby's parents during the Christmas holiday. The main characters each have a unique personality, but they interact well and portray a feeling of 'family' between them. The animation is superb and the subtitles are easy to read. Tokyo Godfathers is magical and heartwarming. A truly delightful anime film about friendship, love and miracles ... with a perfect ending."
4,A Christmas Fable for the Great Recession,"As I'm a sucker for anime films, it didn't take much to convince me to snap up a copy of Tokyo Godfathers when I saw it in a cutout bin; only $3. But I had no idea what a thoughtful, touching, funny film it is. On Christmas Eve a trio of Tokyo homeless people--a bum, a transvestite, and a runaway teenage girl--find a baby girl abandoned in a trash heap. Then come their wild adventures, as they try to reunite the infant with the mother who apparently abandoned her. Of course, it turns out to not be as simple as that. Nothing is quite what it seems. By the time they finish, the three street people are well on the way to redeeming themselves and those that they touch during this nearly magical holiday season. Not only is it a good story well told, but a beautiful one, too; the snowy cityscapes of Tokyo are breathtaking. Just a heart-warming, wonderful film. One of the best Christmas movies I've ever seen. Be sure to watch it this coming holiday season."
3,Causes stomach ache almost immediately after taking :(,"Definitely a good multivitamin - Gives a nice boost when I take it in the morning. Unfortunately, it also all of the sudden has caused stomach aches almost right after I take it, no matter if I take it with food or not. When I first switched to this vitamin a few years ago I did not have any problems, but now I get a stomach ache every single morning which is a real drag. They must have changed something in their formula. After doing some research, it seems that the Iron content in the vitamin causes this problem for many people. Suggestions say to find a vitamin that is Iron free."
1,BE AWARE! NO EXPIRATION DATE!!!,"Saw a lot reviews about not having expiration dates or production expiring soon. Latest negative review was about half a year from when I bought it (8/5/2012). I thought they fixed the problem. Received the product 2 days later, and STILL NO EXPIRATION DATE!!! I am starting to question the authenticity of the seller."
4,Checks and balances,"The outline of the book is outstanding. It's a shame some people may misread and misinterpret much of what George is relating from her own life experiences. She could have spent more time and space reflecting on the Biblical guidelines for a happy marriage, as well as examples or illustrations from other people rather than herself. The whole issue of submission should not overshadow the role of the wife to provide a check and balance for success and happiness in a marriage."
3,Pixter is great...too bad you can't find software for it.,"My 4-year old loves the Pixter, however, I have been trying to find the software with the games on it. You can't find it anywhere. Well, not true...I found it on [online store] for [$$$]. Why would they make some of the software unavailable? It is frustrating to buy a product and not be able to find its accessories. I would recommend it if your child likes to play the same software over and over and over."
4,Great for the Car!,"This is great for road trips. It keeps my daughter (7) content while my son plays Game Boy. One disappointment thus far, I have not yet been able to find anyone that has the Game Expansion Cartridge in stock. Very frustrating, as my daughter is too old for the ABC Cartridge but I would like her to have variety!"
2,"Bought the Pixter instead of a Game Boy, but really no fun","I kept resisting getting my 6 year old son a Game Boy, because kids get so addicted to them and I have not been able to find educational software. So I bought this instead. This is boring and hard to use. I wish someone would just start making Reader Rabbit for the Game Boy."
1,Ours doesn't work!,"It sounds like a great toy, but ours worked erratically from the minute we took it out of the box. Will be returning it, but am cautious about replacing it if it is not a durable toy -- not at these prices."
2,"A very basic ""best of"" show","The packaging for this DVD was very promising...but too good tobe true. This is a poorly done ""clip"" show that could have beena keeper.The good:You get a brief glimpse at a half dozen different contests.There is a top ten segment that features the ""best"" contestwinners (although not all of the girls actually won.)The BAD:In the main program, the clips of each girl's routine is edited down to about 30 seconds. You hardly have time to identify thegirl, then they move on to the next performer.What's even more STUPID: They take the time to show the lameaward presentation of each contest in its entirity! (Don't allguys buy these DVDS to see the girls get a bouquet of flowers?)Overall, I wouldn't pay full price for this DVD (unless you'regonna use your pause button every ten seconds...)Hot Body did a horrible job editing this one."
5,Great,The new version has an ultrasound section which is more extensive than the first edition. The book is sound and an excellent review. It is certainly the new review book as opposed to other texts. It is good for residents and practicing radiologists. I am finished with residency and fellowship and it is a handy reference book! (2nd edition)
3,"Great product, fast shipping, but Mine came open","My rolling pin came in a Amazon box that was well sealed. the problem I have is that the rolling pin's orinally packaging is opened. the bottom part of the package is cut open with what looks like a razor blade and the rolling pin is dirty. I am assuming I was sold a used and returned rolling pin. Whoever packed it was well aware that the packaging was damaged because the rolling pin was placed inside of a plastic bag...I am complaining about this to their customer service. I should have just got up and went to Michaels to buy one instead of being lazy and buying it off of here. I know I can just wash it as I would have to do anyway but I was sold this product under the impression that It SHOULD have been new. I have attached a pic of how my rolling pin arrived.For the actual review of this rolling pin. I have a small one, same brand etc and it works great so no complaints about it's function."
3,"Not bad, but could be better","This book is a good start for those who do not know anything about ASP.NET or are moving to web development. If you have some experience in web development you may find yourself skipping some chapters.However, it is evident that the technical editing was not done properly. Chapter 18 had VB.NET code with an extension of .cs, which means it should have been a C# code.I have not read Mastering ASP.NET using VB.NET (by the same author and publisher), but I suspect that most of the material in the C# version was just ported from VB.NET version.I would not agree on some of the statements made about which authentication method but it does cover what's available and the book does explain some of the basics."
2,Not a good book for beginners,I was following the instructions in this book to create a new project. It just didn't work out the way as the book says.
3,"expensive, and small","i have always loved this kind of toy. this one is very expensive for the size of it. however, the size is not bad as i had an experience with my baby getting hurt when i was at a friends house and she fell on my friends toy which is very similar but much bigger. my baby got a little ""booboo"" from the other one. this one feels safer"
3,Lazy,"The Mentalist is the type of program I have come to think of as ""The Lazy Detective Series."" This is a newer breed of detective show in which some genius figures everything out in ten seconds flat and the police never have to do any real detecting. Numbers and Lie To Me also also fit into this genre niche. Of course, its not really the detectives who are lazy, its the writers. Not having to ever write real mysteries which are solved via deductive reasoning, police procedure, interrogation and so on must make it very easy on them. Top it off with a cast which looks like it just walked out of the pages of a fashion magazine and you have an instant hit. Light and easily digestible with no thought required and fun to look at. Except for the lead who is essentially an arrogant sleaze bag, the cast is all very likable if a bit one dimensional. Tagline: The Mentalist- goes down easily and completely forgotten by the next morning."
5,The Mentalist Season #1,Down loaded first on amazon but when they lost authority I ordered full season throw same. I really like this show it's defiant.
1,RIPOFF!!!!,This is nothing more then a ripoff of USA Networks much better show 'Psych'. Don't bother.
5,Mentalist Season One,"My wife and I love this show, and the first season they ran it at 9-10PM. The last two seasons they have moved it to 10-11PM. I'm sorry, long days and I need to head to bed by 10! I could record it or use a DVR, but I don't. We missed watching the show and have since purchased Season One and Two. I absolutely love it, clever writing, Patrick Jane's lines are so amusing, especially the way he'll say things with a twinkle in his eye, and they have a well developed and enjoyable cast. The recording are done well, and there are a lot of episodes, Season One has 23 episodes and special features. We typically watch two or three a night, and have really enjoyed them. It is one of those DVD's that you'll watch, then pull out next year and be happy to watch again. Season Three, just ended last week and that DVD will be coming out in the next few months. I already have it on back-order. Great present for someone who loves the show, but is lazy like me and won't record it."
5,Simply Phenominal,This show is a pleasure to watch every week. The plots are always enticing and never formulaic. The cast is quite talented - especially Simon Baker.
5,The How of Now,"As a longtime seeker of enlightenment, I've read many a book that promised guidance. And I've received a fair share. But this book has come into my life at a crucial time and seems, more than others before it, equal to the task. It provides a simple and effective--I didn't say ""easy""-- method for attaining bliss by teaching a two-question process. The first question brings one's present reality into focus; the second gives one a ""leg up"" on accepting that reality.When I read a book that thoroughly meets my needs, as now, I don't pretend to be impartial or a careful critic. In fact, I want to say that the writing is exquisite, but don't know how much my pleasure in the book's content informs that opinion.If timing is everything, and I believe it is, then my wish for you, reading this review, is to share my good fortune. May you meet this book with an open heart, letting the gift of its message march in."
4,Fabulous combination of flavors,"I received a bar of Dolfin's milk chocolate with masala as a gift, and I am now hooked. It is hard to describe the flavor- a combination of spicy and sweet that seems odd but works very well. Milk chocolate sometimes tastes too sweet for me- hence my preference for dark chocolate- but this combination hits all the right notes. The masala flavors are not overpowering, so people who fear spice can rest assured. It is hard to put the bar down, since I just want to keep eating it!"
1,I was there too,There was no tradition of discriminating against Asians in the USMC...I would refer you to Navy Cross recipient Maj Chew-Een Lee USMC - what do you think he underwent being a AA Marine officer in the 50s! I was at OCS the same time Bruce was there...no big deal - some racial remarks but nothing I would call institutionalized discrimination. I and a Vietnamese-American graduated the same summer he was there - why weren't we dropped? Maybe because we performed to acceptable standards while Bruce did not. OCS is meant to subject candidates to mental and physical stress - if you can't hack someone calling you names - how will you take combat?? Most of my Sgt Instructors were minorities themselves - if anything I think they were glad to see that a minority was becoming an officer. I've been a Marine officer for 15 years and can only say - I think he's made himself famous at the expense of other AA Marine officers who have graduated OCS without having to file a lawsuit.Semper Fidelis
5,Prozone PZ6 indoor air purifier.,"Highly recommends this products. Keeps the air so much cleaner.Prozone PZ6 Indoor Air Purifier, Black"
4,Quiet & Efficient,This replaces the same brand and model that I had for three years. It worked very well and I was compltely satisfied. I expect the same from this new unit.
5,Prozone PZ6 is an outstanding product,"We purchased the Prozone P6Z 5 -6 years ago to eliminate pet odors in our home. It did a terrific job and most of the time forgot it was even there because there is virtually no noise and it is small in size. The tube which as a guaranteed life of 20,000 hours or about 2.28 years (24/7) lasted 5 years running continuous. I did not know when it stopped until the pet odors came back so I checked the unit and found it has stopped working.I sent it to the manufacturer and it was repaired for $50.00. In the meanwhile I purchased a second one. This product has run 24/7 for 5 years. We purchased it for about $125.00 back then which means it cost of about $25.00 per year plus a very small amount of electricity. I would recommend it to anyone."
3,Good for beginning painters,"Jerry Yarnell is a very accomplished painter and has had a series (or more) on TV, so I had hopes this video would make a good presentation for an artists' group. Unfortunately, it is really just basic information for beginning painters and not of much interest or use to those who already have painting experience."
2,Not a good source,"I was really disappointed in this book. It's not a very good source of ""hack proofing"" I was hoping to have something that I could use as a training guide for other developers, but this was certainly not it. The book contains information regarding locking down the web server's operating system and changing some settings in the CF Administrator, but it is not at all an effective tool for training developers or yourself in producing hack-proof ColdFusion applications.Skip this one... It's not nearly worth the price."
5,A Bag of Stale Fritos and alot of Mosquitos...,"Makin' love...ridin' a bike...throwin' a football thru arubber tire swing. You do it once-you can do it a million timesover. Same for the SCOTS-still making that tried and truepsych/voodoobilly/surf music since day one, now honed downand as sharp as a farmer's chicken decapitatin' hatchet. Whereelse can you get a peach colored leisure suit and a pair ofFlorsheim boots in the same ditty? Oh yeah...and nobody can playthe Danelectro like Rick Miller. Great production, even bettersongs. While listenin, you can ""let yer dog run he'll be back when he's done...chasin' those critters away."" And bassist MaryHuff's standout ""Just How Lonely"" will send shivers down anyPatsy Cline fan's spine. Great music, excellent lyrics...not adud in the lot. Get yer 8-piece box of fried chicken, a case ofDixie blackened voodoo beer, prop up yer feet, let out a few""YEEHA'S"", sit back and enjoy...for this is The Real McCoy."
4,SCOTS STILL RULE ON LATEST CD,"The latest release by the Skids shows they are still the kings of the rocking/grooving/blues/country thang they do. My favorites on the latest are Pass the Hatchet, Drunk and Lonesome Again, Just How Lonely, I Learned to Dance in Mississippi, Haw River Stomp, and the updated King of the Mountain ( long time favorite ). If you're still not convinced on how much the Skids rule, just check 'em out in person the next time they come near your town. They'll get ya grooving and give you some fried chicken and banana puddin to keep you satisfied. I only wish I could play like Rick can play those 6 and 12 strings."
5,SCOTS in Memphis,"This CD rivals Dirt Track Date for the best of SCOTS. Saw them in Memphis and they were rockin as usual. a note to Patrick above: SCOTS is just getting better. Get a clue man.These guys should get some air play with a couple of these tunes. ""Just how Lonley"" could be a crossover hit if radio stations would wake up.I look forward to the next trip SCOTS makes to the area cause the chicken and rock will be flyin."
4,It`s ok,"Not very posable. Not very good details. But hey, it`s from TAS of the 90`s, it`s alright, but it could be cheaper."
1,Lets change that church to fit society?!,"Homosexuality, no matter how you put it is a sin. Not that we shouldn't welcome sinners into the church, that's exactly where they need to be. Jesus never said to hate the person comitting the sin, God actually does love everyone. The issue comes about when you grab onto a sin and make it your lifestyle. Use it to bolster your identity.Christianity isn't about hating or bashing gays, as the LGBT front would love you to think. It's about doing what is right in God's eyes and walking rightly with him.The argument of ""Born that way"" doesn't hold here. I may be born with a proclivity to steal, but if I ""come out"" and say, ""Hey man, not my fault, I was born this way!"" then I am accepting the sin. Walking right with God may cause you to have to change. Lets not spend our time on justification of sin, and instead spend time trying to find ways to glorify Him."
3,"Looks Good, Bad Quality","It only looks good when your wearing it with a vest and belts and stuff. If you just wear this shirt it looks like you belong in a Shakespear play. Waay to poofy. After one night of wearing it, it ripped from the arm pit all the way down to the bottom of the shirt. Definitely a one time use item."
2,Nice Looking But Junk Quality,"I bought the x-large size, as I am a busty and chunky woman. The fit was great and looked very nice, but after wearing it only a few hours many seams separated and was completely ruined by the end of the day. Not worth the money I paid!"
3,Falls short,"The title is excellent. Great Concept. Road trips, commuting, outings...... Kids today spend more time in cars than imaginable previously.Many fun but completely impractical suggestions. The more doable ideas are not so creative. It is not a bad book but didn't offer anything new to us. Think music games, word games, craft projects, books on tape and storage. However if you are at a loss maybe this book is for you."
4,WATCH OUT!! NOT FOR YOUNG TODDLERS!!!,"Bought this for xmas for my twin almost 3 yrs olds (because amazon says they are 3 and up). Lo and behold, the box lists it as for 4 year olds. And that is for real. These are incredible trucks in great detail, but they are not up to the damage of the love of a 3 yr old, nor are they safe for one. Sadly, they got these for xmas because their mom believed the ad and they are broken already and NOT safe for them (many chokable parts!!!) and they are in love with them so I can't hide them 'til they're old enough.By the way, for an older kid these would be great."
3,Too much money.,For the price you pay it really is just another plastic toy.. sure it squirts water but kids will move on to the next thing quickly.
2,sad toy in six months,"I bought this toy for my sons third birthday. He loved it and it is awesome except that they made a spraying fire truck toy that could not weather being outside. After six months of outside use, the belts are destroyed the ladder is broken off and unusable, and the hose nozzle is long gone My son still likes it to spray at camp fires we have, but besides that it was way not worth the money. THe recycled plastic is great, but it doesn't hold up outside, and why have a spraying fire truck that can't be outside? Sorry Bruder, try again."
2,"Great book, AWFUL READING OF THE BOOK!!!!!","This book is a timeless classic for sure, but the narration is the worse I have ever heard bar none! It was so bad and so hard to follow with no pauses of any kind. The listener is exposed to one long run on sentence from start to finish. I gave up trying digest what I was attempting to learn from the book and just deleted my download. If you don't mind pressing pause all the time to give yourself a moment to ingest what you just heard and then press play again, this could be a reading for you."
1,"Faulty Chinese Parts, Expensive Filter, Poor Customer Service","The replacement filters are a ripoff, the Chinese on/off switch shorted out and getting help from Hunter customer service is more frustrating than dealing with the 3 Stooges. Hunter should drop this product line and stick to their overhead fans."
2,"Non-Standard, EXPENSIVE Filters!","I previously owned an air filter that used standard-sized filters, so you could go to the hardware store and get a HEPA furnace filter in that size instead of paying a FORTUNE for the ""official"" replacement filters. I thought I would do the same on this model, but they wised up and used a completely non-standard filter size, so you have to go through them for the replacement filters (which cost as much as the unit does). The ionizer is nice, otherwise I would have given it 1 star."
3,It was okay,"I bought this for one song, and it was outstanding. The rest of it was not my cup of tea."
4,Great documentary.,Elmo wasn't around when I was a kid so I never really knew that much about him except that all the kids love him. It was fascinating to see how he came about the deeply complicated man that created him.
5,Charming,"I didn't know if I would be interested in this story, but it turned out to be really good. I can't imagine that someone would know from a young age that they wanted to be a puppeteer and then someday turn out to be one of the best. It's worth watching."
1,The human body portrayed in the most brutal manner,"I bought this book after hearing an interview with the author on public radio. At the time, I was involved in observing numerous surgical procedures and found myself in agreement with the author's descriptions of the beauty of the human body as seen through surgery. The images in the book convey nothing of the sort. While technically brilliant, it seems the author selected the pictures for their shock value and brutality. Where is there any notion of the care that is taken for the patient? Where is there any depiction of the exquisite skill of the surgeon? Where is there any attempt to preserve the dignity of the patient? They all are on the ""cutting room floor"". The author provided no room for them in this book."
5,unbeliveable,there are many songs and groupos that i like but this tops it!(aside from relient k) the songs are so amazing! great guitar playing and his voice fits the music...it's soooo cool! get it it is totally worth it!
3,GOOD FOR A BEGINNER.,"This is a very good guitar for a beginner. Has a nice sound and handles well. The only suggestion I have is that you buy a good set of guitar strings when you buy the guitar. The guitar strings that comes with are very cheap, they broke within one week. Spend extra six bucks and buy some good guitar strings. Can't go wrong for money that this guitar cost , it is a good guitar."
2,Not as good as reviews put it,"All 5 stars reviews --- that was the reason I bought this item. But I was terribly disappointed. The timbre was not good, with rigid strings that needed to be replaced. No wax on the surface; hand feeling was not smooth and was just too light in weight.My friend bought a second-hand Fender Guitar with the same price and was way better than this one.Do not buy this one. I totally regret that I bought it. No more than a mass-produced low-quality guitar."
2,Not impressed,"This is a good guitar for beginners because it's something to start with and learn on. It's cheap which allows you to not spend alot of money on your first guitar only to lose interest or quit. But I do not recommend this guitar to any seasoned guitar player. It goes out of tune very quickly. Alothough it does produce a warm tone, I just can't handle the constant tuning."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be.,"This guitar looks like a great deal, and if you're just starting out, its acceptable. But I was really taken aback when I saw it came with rusty strings and the action was so low that it isn't playable. I contacted the company and they are sending me a replacement set of strings, but I have to take the guitar to a shop to have the neck re-set, which I currently don't have money for. Just kind of inconvenient. Make sure you have some money set aside to get it set once you buy it."
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"I've had this guitar for over a year now, the action is way to high. I had to put electric guitar strings on it because regular acoustic strings make the neck bend and it makes the action way to high. I can't play any notes above the 12th fret which just isn't cool. DO NOT BUY THIS!! Please save your money for a more expensive guitar. Word from the wise: Never go cheap on a instrument!! I recommend getting a Washburn, Ibanez, or low end Taylor or Martin. I really suggest you DO NOT buy this. I myself am never buying a Takamine ever again."
2,First time disappointment,"I had recently seen this guitar at a local music shop and was sold on it. So, I thought I'd check Amazom first. It was an unbelievable price difference from what I saw at the music shop. Having bought instruments many times before through Amazon ...and noting it came from Musicaian's Friend...there was no question and I bought it.What I got was disheartening. I've never seen strings like this. In different places along the length of the strings there was something that looked like stain or rust or burn...or I don't know what else. One of those strings is even starting to ""unwind"" itself. I'm sort of shocked and a little angry, but this is the one time I actually got what I paid for. I'm guessing they were unloading the defective ones through this website.I hope this saves someone else from not thinking twice...and to be ready to be disappointed if theirs is as poor as mine."
3,just like that,"It didn't come with the exact specifications and it came almost a month after I ordered it, nothing more"
2,Scriabin's ears,"The performances on this CD are full of poetry. Most of the pieces recorded are the preludes, the slow, sombre, 'mystical' elements weaving in and out of O'Riley's fingers. Whereas O'Riley is able to bring out these elements with effectiveness, his overall playing lacks dynamics of any kind. He plays with no abandon whatsoever. Sonatas 4 and 10 are on this CD. I could not finish listening to the 4th, maybe because I am so use to THE Hamelin version. As for his performance of the 10th, it was mild. The last track, Vers la Flamme-again, no abandon, no dynamics. A very hairy piece I admit. But Sofronitsky I think does it justice. Every reviewer gives this CD 5 stars. Poetry is fine, but you need more than this to play Scriabin. O'Riley just doesn't quite cut it."
4,Interesting but old,"Do not expect anything fancy with this video! This is a video that will probably only be of interest to a student of ballet, a dance historian, or someone with a special interest in the Kirov. We fit into that final category, as my daughter's main dance teacher has a solo on this video! She currently teaches at Orlando Ballet, so any of you young dancers attending OBS for a summer intensive will likely have her for class. She was and is amazing!"
5,"A very personal, heartfelt version of the Holy Bible.",I pick this up every single morning. The words are clear and speak to my heart. The added explanations and stories by Max Lucado enhance the biblical stories and spark me through the daytime hours. Very well put together.
2,Flimsy phone(Handle it with great care if you can),"Recently bought the VX8100 as part of my account upgrade with Verizon. The ph has some good features but LCD screen is very flimsy and pressure sensitive. I had put it back in my front pocket after a call as I normally do. When I took it out the next time, the screen had cracked. All along I had been just sitting and I never bumped against anything. Its just 20 days from the time I bought it and Verizon wants $50 to replace it. I had a motorola before this for 3 years and had dropped it many times but never had this problem."
3,"Features: some great, some not so","This is a sleek little flip phone with many terrific features: excellent main and outside screens, nice ringtone capability, voice dialing, picture and ringtone caller ID.But if you were planning to sync your PC address book with this phone, forget it. It won't do calendar sync at all, and the address book feature (after you buy the cable and software) only provides phone numbers. So if you want to use your phone to look up an email or mailing address on the road, you can't.Also, look out: Verizon says you have fifteen days to test the phone and service, but they start counting the day you place the order, before the phone is even shipped. If I knew who regulates the mobile industry I'd make a complaint. From the day I actually received the phone I called Verizon after ten days and was told it was too late."
5,Review of my cell phone that was ordered,The first phone I received the battery was dead and the charger did not work. I corresponded to the company and returned that phone and they sent a brand new phone which is great. The only issue now is that it did not come with a car charger as it had said in the ad. Unfortunately I could not find the name of the company to write and tell them that everything is fine but the phone charger was not included (something that would come in very handy here in FL where it hurricanes). So if you could send them my thanks and also this request I would greatly appreciate your help. Thank you. Robert Libby
1,Totally dissatisfied with the VX8100,"After almost 2 years with this phone, I have nothing good to say about it. The reception has been terrible, the battery discharges within 10 hrs (and that's when I don't use it--when I do talk, the talk time is under an hour), and it's difficult to hear anyone half the time. Several friends with the vx8100 have had similar experiences. I guess I was spoiled by my Nokia--and I'll be going back. I can't imagine ever buying an LG again."
2,"A nice phone, but crippled by VZW","I have purchased this for family members and often recommended it, but sometime in February, VZW busted the .mp3 player so that it no longer works on new phones.I don't know with what software / feature relase this took place, but using the phone as a simple .mp3 player was a great plus for this phone, and the reason I bought it and recommended it to others.At some point, I suppose VZW will turn off the phone service features as well..."
5,Enjoyable,The book was enjoyable and I look forward to another level of this series if one is every written.
5,Incredible!,"This is the first Bee Gees CD I bought. I didn't realize how much I love the brothers until I heard the CD. If you're looking for a complete compilation of great music produced by the Bee Gees, this is probably it. There is one song missing that I wish was here, but it never went to #1 -- ""Morning of My Life"". That song showcases their raw talent at 3-part harmony like no other.If you're thinking about buying this, don't think any more. Buy it."
1,The size of my CHECKBOOK literally TINY! DO NOT BUY,"This I purchased in a three pack and I thought I was getting a 3 full size coloring books. But no, I got two tiny coloring books (The little ABC coloring book, The little animal ABC coloring books) and full size was ABC By Anna Pomaska. If you are seeking a full size one I suggest purchasing the 2.50 by Anna Pomaska. I can not believe the other two are so small a child could not coloring in them. Literally it is the size a small checkbook! Be careful if you decide to order in a three pack like I did as ""The Little..."" title should read Super Tiny Coloring book. What a waste of money buying this for a child! Very unhappy mother!"
4,History of Plato's,It's a good documentry of swinging in NYC back in the 70-80's. If your from NYC you might like to know what was happening the same time as Studio54.
3,"Is historical and very informative, not sexy","If you are expecting lots of explicit sex, you'll be disappointed. As a documentary, it is a bit tedious. Didn't bother to watch to the end."
2,sister freaks,repetitive of Jesus Freaksnot enough new stories in it that differ from the Jeasus Freaks book.
4,MouseTrap/Operation/Simon,"Mouse Trap/Operation/SimonAll three of these games kept my kids happy for hours. I especially loved Mouse Trap since I didnt have to go through the frustrating phase of setting the board up so I could play with my children. If your child likes Gameboy & Board games, I highly recomend this one."
3,Mediocre to boring,"I purchased this game in hopes of more than hitting the 'A' button. In, Mousetrap, geez, there is no strategy, no decision making at all. It is much better in real life. This game is all about the trap, and if it works or not, so it is very bad for an SP. Operation is also incredibly easy, but you do get to pick what to take out and when. Simon is a memory game. Blah. I bought it for 20 bucks, and well thats really all its worth if that. None of the board game packs are very good. I guess thats why they are 'bored' games. HAHA"
4,GB Mouse Trap/Operation/Simon,Great fun! An old classic game and its good to see that my 5 year old enjoyed this game as much as I did as a child.
2,"Not ""industrial"" strength","A friend of ours had this door stop at their apartment and it looked great, felt heavy, and most importantly was able to hold their door open. So I ordered it for our apartment door.I was hopeful because in the description it said it was good for industrial doors as well as regular apartment doors. Our apartment door is particularly heavy because of a strong mechanism for automatically shutting the door.Well this Blomus door stop did not stand a chance. It just jumped up and down as the door steadily pushed it to a close. So sad :(The construction, otherwise, seemed nice, but it was not able to grip the hardwood floor at all and was far too light weight for our modern high rise apartment door."
3,Interesting stuff,"This book is full of tidbits of interest and usefulness. However, it's a bit confusing at times as Safire pokes fun at certain usage ""mistakes"" that aren't all that bad. His tongue-in-cheek presentation makes one wonder at times whether he means what he says or not. One also wonders whether he got caught up in writing to a difficult and wordy title. I generally enjoy reading Safire, but this book is a departure from his usual clarity."
5,Good Resource,"I am still in the process of reading this book, but it is jam-packed with a lot of helpful information for those of us trying to get through the daily grind of the workplace and for when you feel you have no-where to turn and no recourse/then this book is for you. It gives you no-nonsense information in easy to read English. If you are having problems in the workplace this book is very highly recommended to give you a ton of information as to what your legal rights are in the workplace and what recourse you have. For once someone makes the worker feel powerful and you DO have choices and options that of course your employer would NEVER tell you about and in my case the HR Department that is totally ""pro-company"" and ""anti-employee"". The truth be now known."
3,A little helpful,"As a recently unemployed person I found useful information concerning my rights, where exactly to look for information pertaining to my state's unemployent and COBRA laws, and what to say and more importantly what not to say to the unemployment office and when looking for a new position. The book also give helpful tips when starting a new job and signing a new employment contract. If you are a legal whiz this isn't the book for you. If you are just an average Joe/Jane, then sure you will probably pull some helpful information from this book."
4,This is not a game.,"This product is not a game. It is a replacement cord and it happens to work for playstation 3's. It is a generic brand (I can't remeber what company the packaging said it was--intec or something, I think. It's much thinner than the original playstation cords. I actually bought it for my laptop (plugs into the adapter) and it's thinner even than my original one. So far it works."
5,PS3 Slim AC cable that fits!,I looked all over for a cable that fit. I even ordered the Nyko one for the fat original PS3 model. This is the one that fits.
5,Architecture of the computer kind,"Reviews architectures and operation of conventional computers. The term 'architecture' can be used to refer to the view of a conventional computer as shown by its assembly language, as well as in other contexts. This reference considers the basic elements of a conventional computer architecture, compilation, data coding, registers, memory addressing, instruction sets, branching in programs, subroutines, interrupts, virtual memory, input/output, instruction execution, increasing performance, instruction lookahead, parallel and pipeline instruction execution."
3,Phrases & Sayings,"This book reads more like a dictionary rather than an informative or humorous history of where common sayings and slang terms came from and have changed over the years. However, it is not a waste of time. There is good information of where words and phrases were documented, therefore a history of how and when they were used. There is also quite a bit of cross references so younger generations than myself may have a few of those ah-ha moments and know their parents & grandparents are not really that crazy. I may search for a companion book to use with this one, but for now it is quite good material and easy to read."
1,Scissor Jack,"I bought the jack because it looked like it would fit my application well. It did fit, but it wouldn't lift a 1,000 lb load although rated for 4,000 lbs. The screw was well lubricated with grease, but there is just too much friction to be over ridden by the crank. It was cheap, but still not worth the little money I paid."
5,Keeps you guessing...,"As always, MacBeth ferrets out the true villain from among the many possibilities, without threatening his simple life by getting promoted. In this story the author focuses on vanity, jealousy and longing - topics familiar to most readers."
4,Have read better Hamish Macbeth Books,"Usually I like all of M. C. Beaton's books, especially the Hamish Macbeth series but I did not particularly care for the plot in this book. I felt the plot was weak...all the women falling for this handsome, charming newcomer and making fools of themselves. However, since I am such an avid fan of M. C Beaton, I read all her books if only for the colorful descriptions of the countryside and the characters (especially Hamish Macbeth) of these small villages in Scotland, especially Lochdubh and Drim."
4,Hamish McBeth Series,"I'm in love with the fictional Hamish. That engaging, laid back (way back) but intelligent constable who has no luck whatsoever in the romance department is truly delightful. The author does a splendid job in her creation of this character and her description of the Scottish Highlands."
4,tomb raider,this needs to be ran in compatibility mode right click on the short cut that runs the game go to properties go to the compatibility tab check the box in compatibility mode leave in windows 95 hit apply
4,Does Not Play on Linux,Tomb raider games do not play on linux.I don't know why Amazon says that it does...
1,have none,i have not been able to play this game because i don't have the gamecard you need...the packaging was in good condition...my rating is based on the fact that i have not been able to play...
4,Good for basic reference,"This book is an excellent intro to criminal profile types. The author explains the legal conditions concerning how an offender may claim insanity. The author does delineate crime concerning the youth. The book also informs you about what responsibilites, ethics and procedures a forensic psychologist has concerning criminal defenses.The author also brings your attention to the challenges and issues within the field of forensic psych that concern malingering and lie detection. The author holds degrees in clinical psych, forensic psych, philosophy of psychology and years of experience. The book is informative and educational. The book does not contain real cited cases but contains much knowledge about the field."
2,Too Long a Chase,"Mr. Durand concocted an interesting premise with a Javert and Jean Valjean type chase. However, it was the longest most repetitive chase I have ever read. The characters kept me engaged for the most part but at the halfway point I was praying for new action or a swift conclusion. The cat-and-mouse improbability became extremely annoying. He did create an interesting sociopath in the character Laemmle yet even he could not redeem the deja vu experienced every thirty pages in the book."
3,Decent collection,"This is a German import collection of Albert Hammond's hit singles back in the '70s. As far as I can tell they are all original tracks from those days. They are not re-recorded songs as some said for his other greatest hits. Albert is probably only known in the US for his ""Never rain in S. CA"" single; his other songs are better known in Europe. This collection will allow others to sample his other hit songs. For me it is a good trip down the memory lane."
5,Genius,"Tori Amos is a genius. This DVD is just a sampling of how perfect she is. It is a must have and would make a nice gift. She may now only have a cult following, but it is the best music around from one of the nicest people I have ever met."
4,Good tips for those short on cash,"First, this is a short book. Verging on a booklet. ""54"" pages, but it's basically 8.5x11 pages cut in half and curlex bound so really 14 sheets of paper doublesided. This book would work really well as a PDF download (hint hint).However, it's still a very good value. I deal mostly with informational Websites in education and non-profit. I'm simply not going to spend big bucks on an SEO consultant, specialized software or on expensive industry research reports - I need simple, real-world things I can do to improve our site's visibility and the basic understanding of why I should do those things. Was the content I found in here worth [ the money ]to me? You bet!"
1,This game is horrible!,I have never played a worse console flight combat game in mylife and I own PS and N64. I am not a hard core flyer/gamer and amusually easily impressed. The graphics are no better than a mediocre PS game.END
4,Honest Review of Air Force Delta,"This is a great first gen flight experience and is graphically pleasing to play. Flight physics aren't realistic but this is, after all, an arcade flyer. Rent before you buy if you're not into flyers but if you're into flight sims - you'll love this. Go ahead and pick it up..... One of the top 5 titles for Dreamcast I've played so far - (Out of 9)...."
1,Handle with Care,"The book highlighted some popular notions about what the experiences of people with autism are, but was not supported by any credible information. The advice was trite and intuitive, and offered very little that could be considered meaningful. ""Right From the Start"" or ""Let Me Hear Your Voice"" are much better buys, and are far more practical."
5,Looks great in our bathroom,"Bought this for our master bathroom, had it installed so can't comment on that. It looks and works great, haven't had any problems with it (1 year now). Highly Recommend."
2,Until the last minute!,We were looking forward to watch this movie. The anxiety to watch it went all away. The movie took as long as it said it would take (close to a month to arrive). It is still in the package. No more free time. I ordered it together with two other movies from different vendors and they arrived way before the ETA.
5,Berlitz Italian Phrase Book and Dictionary,"I bought one of these books with the CD and another book for my husband. It is perfect for our trip to Italy. I bought two other sets of Italian phrase books with CD, before this and found them impractical. They covered much more Italian than I would ever need or be able to learn.This book has everything a traveler needs laid out in chapters: At the Airport, At the Restaurant; At the Hotel; Greetings, etc. It's too bad it took me three tries to find it."
5,Really loved this book.,"Read it twice in Paperback, which I purchased twice because I lost my first copy and now I'm going to get it in hardback to add to my collection.Great book, funny, heart wrenching and believable (as much as a romance novel can be). I personally think it's a great read, characters have depth and you can feel the love they have for each other."
5,GPS systems,"Bought this for my directionally handicapped husband last Christmas, and he loves it. Very easy to learn and use."
4,four stars out of five,"My husband borrowed his friends Tom Tom One when we went on vacation earlier this year. It was a godsend. It was easy to use and assisted us with finding places to eat, hotel to stay at along the route and alternative routes if traffic was backed up. We decided to buy one of our own as a result of the positive experience. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars for the rating for the simply fact that I feel that the unit should have a stylet on the side much like a PDA...but my husband does not. You decide."
3,Frustrated,"With so many reviews singing praise for the ease of operation, I feel like a dummy. I found the learning curve steep, the instructions minimalistic and the navigation of the screens awkward. OK, so I have learned, and that's over; now to the continuing frustration. First test trip in town, ONE led us to a finish point a half block south and block east of the actual location (different street & street number). In planning an eleven-stop itenerary, for two of the stops ONE would not accept a street number, though map searches through Google, Map Quest and Yahoo! Maps took the address and resulted in a parking-lot destination. As other respondents indicated, this leaves us anticipating a bad outcome on the trip (we have Google Map printed instructions--cost far less than the ONE). We'll see how it all comes out and update this review in a couple months."
3,Extra Mileage,"This is a nice product and it gets you there. BUT, it sometimes takesits own direction and the long way around. If I know where I am goingit will tell me to go in a different direction and yesterday if I followed its route it would have added 5 miles to a 20 mile route. I dont know why this is but with gas costs today, it should be more conservative and take the shortes route. Other that that it is OK"
2,Needs to be upgraded a lot.,"The problem I have with this is that what it says is the fastest way is not. It doesn't know most of the roads where I live and leads me to a lot of barricaded roads, gated roads and seems not to be able to locate addresses once your near your destination. Its probably programed to run the shortest distance but sometimes that leads me into mucho traffic and traffic lights. I use it to run service calls in my business and time wasted is money wasted."
1,Buy a Garmin!,"I can not begin to describe how bad the TomTom GPS system is. When my father ran the demo to get from the Eastern Shore of Maryland to Charleston, SC (basically get on 95 and stay there until you hit southern South Carolina) the demo took 45 minutes, had him going hundreds of miles out of the way, off I-95.The TomTom compared to the Garmin is night and day. You literally turn on the Garmin out of the box and the map shows you where you are. My husband, the ultimate electronic junky, was amazed. I only have good things to say about Garmin. Hope this helps!"
1,tomtom,"TomTom ONE XL 4.3-Inch Widescreen Portable GPS Navigatorthis prduct has no earthly value, it failed to function in english.i threw it into the trash can after 12 hours of frustation. when i called the maufacturer i tried to explain the problem. after a lengthy amount of time following the instructions from a factory trained 'expert' i was put on hold. after s few moments the call ended. i do not recomend this product to any sane person. also amazon will not be seeing anymore of my business.john S"
2,Suction Cup Sucks,The suction cup does not stick to the windshield well in cold weather driving. It keeps falling off the windshield. I have to remount it again with one hand while the other hand to operate the car. It may increase the chance for accidents because of the suction cup.
1,Disappointed,"Beware of customer service support. My unit was defective out of box. It seems flash card not readable. Manufacture customer support facilitated return. However, unit came back 2 weeks later with same problem."
4,Pretty Good,"I just took this unit on a 5000 mile road trip from Chicago to San Antonio, to Phoenix and back. The unit was worth the price, especially for finding routes off the interstate system.The GPS was almost always very precise. Sometimes it would suddenly place me a couple hundred feet away and give me instructions for getting back to where I already was. The voice directions used the word ""yards"" when it should have said ""feet"". The POI database was often incorrect. It would tell me that I had reached my destination when it had actually put me in the middle of nowhere. Gas stations would turn out to be closed down and new ones wouldn't show up. In some areas, POIs are about a half mile off.The PC software did not work with the device, so I could not set-up itineraries in advance of the trip. When I returned home, I saw that the program update was available, which included the fix. Now, if only the POI database were updated and the units fixed in the dialogue, the product would rate 5 stars."
2,Can give bad directions,"After reading many reviews I purchased a Tom Tom One with the expectation that it would be an inexpensive base line portable GPS. I tried it out around town so that I could get familiar with it. Its logic will route you to numbered highways over surface streets and this may not only be confusing and perhaps dangerous, but it can increase the distance to be driven.While driving on names highways, it would direct me to dirt roads and even a farmer's road between grape vines and tree fruit. In addition, the time on the unit would be off by the wierdest amount, ie not just even hours. In fact, the time was never correct, or even close.I am afraid that if I was on roads that I was not familliar with, I might have been placed in harms way it I had followed its directions.I returned the unit for a credit."
2,terrible...,"i really loved everything about this tomtom until i started using it to avoid highways. i live in los angeles, and it does not considers major highways like the 101 and the 170 freeways!!! it became really annoying to constantly be setting it to avoid those roads. then, it just stop charging! the charger connects to the cigarette lighter and it was really really hot and out of nowhere STOPPED WORKING! i couldn't believe it! since the tomtom doesn't come with a wall charger i couldn't charge it any other way. and it definitely was not my car's cigarette lighter because the light was green and kept getting really hot! luckily, i was able to get store credit from where i bought it for another GPS. i'm getting a garmin this time! and also... tomtom work on an inferior routing system than garmin and magnellion. i would suggest trying out those two brands instead."
3,TomTom One review,"I am reasonably happy with my TomTom One performance so far, although, on two occasions, the voice has told me to go take a turn in one direction, but the map display shows the opposite. So far the map has been correct. Very strange. This could be a bit disconcerting when I venture out into unknown territory.But overall it works quite well.I am most disappointed by the fact that my TomTom, bought in September, does not include the most recent 6.75 map release (April ?).The map release on my unit is 6.65. I would judge that 6.65 reflects road changes up to 2 years ago, but that is strictly a guess based on my mini survey in my area. TomTom is very cagey on this subjectTomTom One map updates are very expensive.But for $200 it's a pretty good deal. Especially if you compare with a GPS installed in your car in the $1000-2000 range."
5,Smart Purchase!,"I wasn't sure I would have a need or use for any GPS but now that I have the TomTom I am so glad - I use it all the time. It is accurate, clear, sleek, user-friendly and an overall quality product. I have friends with the GPS built in to their cars and there are ridiculour flaws to the routes. My TomTom in superior! I use it to find new routes to regular commutes/travel and to discover new places to go in neihboring towns and in the city nearby. It is the best purchase and I am thrilled to have it - glad to answer any questions about it too - I'm a big fan!"
3,"Great gadget, questionable directions","Yes, TomTom One is a great gadget. It's small, lightweight, compact and most importantly AFFORDABLE. And I love the fact you can download John Cleese's voice to be your nav guide (for US$20!). My one issue is that it navigates using a ""how the crow flies"" mentality.I had to drive to a store a couple miles away from my home. Looking at Google maps, the logical route was to turn onto the major street near my home, go a couple miles, turn right, go a mile and you're there. So the simplest route is essentially an upside down 'L' shape. When I put the destination address into the TomTom, the routing it plotted looked like a staircase. It had me turning right then left then right then left at every block. That's ridiculous! And when I tried driving the simpler L shaped route, it kept trying to get me back on the staircase routing it originally plotted.I returned the TomTom for a refund the next day."
3,TOO BRITISH FOR THIS AMERICAN !!,"Accurate but annoyingly British for those of us that are 100% AMERICAN.Even the ""American/U.S. Voices"" insist on calling a ""Freeway"" a ""MOTOWAY"" and an exit ramp a ""Whirl-away"". Couple that with annoying British accent (even in the U.S. version) and it makes me want to puke.At least it ain't a French accent.The first time it told me to take the ""Whirl-away"" I thought it wanted me to get on an amusement park ride! A Whirl-a-WHAT!?!?!?We double checked we has ""U.S."" voices but it still used many Northern Europe/U.K. acronyms and nicknames I'm completely unfamiliar with.Many of the options were unavailable for the U.S. when I purchased it such as Traffic monitoring, etc.Okay - but not great. Also the screen crashed and blanked out on me while in the midst of a free way. It has software problems."
3,Slim Styling; Ok to get from point A to B,"The good: The design is nice and easy to use; just plug and go.The bad: The lack of POI's is astounding. I went to the Tom Tom website and there were only a few options as far as downloading additional POI's - Dunkin Donuts and Baskin Robbins were two, and a third was for 10-15 various retail stores, ie: Circuit City, Radio Shack, Costco etc. The website is not helpful at all. Also, the only way to choose either shortest distance, fastest route, etc, is during the initial set up, not when you plan each trip."
4,I love this,"It's built for the map-chllenged, like myself. The directions are very simple and easy to follow, re-computing directions when I take a wrong turn is quick enough that I can make corrections before it's too late. Also, I really like that the directions tell me which lane to be in in plenty of time to get there before the next turn!"
1,"After one year of use, it is dead now. The worst customer service.",After one year of use. My tomtom one has a problem of charging. It is a problem of the device itself not the charger. I tried with new charger but not charing. I tried to solve the problem through customer support and experienced the worst custumer service. I will never buy tomtom again`.
5,Tom Tom GPS,"I used this GPS for my first trip into Manhattan to pick up family returning from a crusie, and took them to LaGuardia. No question about it - if it weren't for this device, I would still be wandering around NYC, and that was 3 months ago. This was the first time I'd used a GPS, and I will never travel w/o it."
4,TOMTOM one,"I love this item! I would have given it 5 stars if I could use it to play mp3s also, but it doesn't. I'm still waiting for maps of Mexico TOMTOM! Once tomtom releases them, I'll give it 5 stars. There are a few errors with the latest released US/CANADA map but I really didn't expect them to be perfect either. I think you can notify tomtom of the errors through their webpage."
1,"Poorly written, don't waste your money.",I saw this book and noticed several outdated ideas. It also reads like it was written by a 2nd grader.
1,Harmful,"The author keeps repeating the same stereotypes throughout the years. Here is his proof that your child might be becoming gay: he talks to his mother a lot, he shows emotions, he doesn't want to play with other boys, he is depressed and isolated, other kids tease him. Stupid, stupid, stupid! Then, he says if fathers play sports with their kids and take them out for ice cream and talk about male bonding issues, they will be fine. Come on, the kid will simply become a sports-loving gay guy.This is harmful because it misguides parents. It gives them false hope, and the author has seemed to suggest in the past that he has alternate reasons for his ""psychology."" When I was a kid, my kindergarton teacher told my parents I was showing gay tendencies, and my parents went on a compaign to change me, like forcing me to play cowboys and indians for an hour. It was ridiculous. Ignore this book."
1,Reviewed by who?,"The one professional review for this book is by George A. Rekers, who was later busted for hiring a male prostitute. Repress much?"
1,You've GOT To Be Kidding!,"Don't waste your money! Your child will be in therapy (or suicidal) at a really young age if you try and follow the ""advice"" in this book. They state parents should toughen up ""girlish"" boys, ""feminize"" rough-and-tumble girls, and make sure their children only have toys, activities, and mannerisms traditionally aligned with their gender.It's a throwback to the 1950's - except there were homosexuals around then, too. Raised in exactly the types of families the authors describe in their book.As I said - Don't waste your money."
1,Suicide,"I found this author's perspective to be counter to research based information. Not only that, the author fails to recognize the importance of supporting a child's self-esteen, self-worth and self-concept in order to help one's child develop into a well-adjusted, resilient adult. This approach can be permanently damaging to the child, the parents and the family unit."
3,3.5 Stars,"This is a peculiar recording for OCS. It does not seem to truly kick into gear until the third cut. Prior to that it does not much sound like OCS. The first two tracks seem like an effort at creating a single or two. Unlike prior efforts, they add a second guitarist. It just seems unecessary in a studio context. It seems to cramp the sound, making for a much more dense record than OCS typically puts out. I always enjoyed their sense of space within their sound. Steve Cradock is one of Britain's finest guitarists, other than in a live context, do you really need a second guitarist? Still, it is still a fine recording. One worth obtaining."
4,Step below their best,"Better than North Atlantic Drift? I think not. That album, in my opinion, is the best thing they've done - even better than Moseley and Marchin'. Those three rank as the top OCS albums, and this one is right on the heels of the lesser two. It starts off a tad weak. The opening track, I Told You So, is catchy but not up to par with lead-off songs on their strongest efforts. The second song - On the Leyline, Waiting - sounds like the Smithereens, not a good thing for a band of this caliber. The Weller song is okay, as is Man in the Middle. The album doesn't really start to gain momentum until the 5th song, but from there on out it's excellent. A different arrangement of the tracks would be even more satisfying. All in all, it's good to hear the boys back and they sound good. I have high hopes for this line-up in the years to come."
3,Beware of binding.,"This is a good textbook for anyone who wants an overview on the elements of speaking in public. The content is broad, but not too deep. It puts perspective on oration that I had not considered before. There is a lot of practical thinking woven into the chapters.However, buyers beware! I bought the ring-bound edition, not understanding that I would have to provide my own 3-ring binder. It was a complete buyer error, but be advised to consider the binding of your textbook. Acquaint yourself with the various types of binding (i.e., spiral, ring, etc.) and identify your preferences."
5,Let's Hear It For Healthy Play Food!,"I was so excited to see these at our Play Group - after finding nothing but milkshakes and cheeseburgers and ice cream cone clones at the store, finally some healthy play food! All the kids at Play Group love this set, and I know my daughter will be very excited to get it as a gift. It's very well made, sturdy and rich-looking, as others have said. No cardboard to rip, plastic to dent or flimsy metal to break and scratch little fingers.Cutting the ""carrots"" and ""cucumber"" has made my daughter want to eat more vegetables at dinner, and she's also learning how to hold and use a knife safely! Great set, great quality and great price."
5,Who'd HaveThought?!,"Who'd have thought that wooden food would be so much fun? I don't know if it's just the cool cutting sounds these foods make when you ""cut"" them, or whether it's that kids love doing what Mom does, but these are really fun. Clever idea."
5,Love it!,"My 11 year old boys played with a set like this years ago when they went to daycare, so I thought my little 3 year old girl would like it, too. I gave it to her for Christmas this year - and she LOVES it! She likes the fact that she can ""cut"" food like mommy does, and she enjoys serving us the vegetables and bread after she cuts it up. Even my boys get in on it - they remember playing with it when they were little. Very durable - I have always loved Melissa and Doug products. She will love playing with this for a long time. A good addition if your child has a kitchen playset."
4,"Great for ""big kids""!","My 2-year old loves this product! She cuts her food like a ""big kid"" and is so proud of herself. She is having a lot of fun serving us bread and making soup. She does have a hard time actually ""cutting"" some of the smaller pieces; She can't get the knife in the pre-cut groove. However, she is not quite 3 yet (recommended age) and she doesn't seem to mind; She just pulls the food apart instead and then pretends to cut it. Overall, a great toy; Sturdy and lots of fun!"
4,My 18 months old son loves this toy,"He loves to cut the bread, watermelon, and carrot. He can sit and play for quite a while with it. A good toy!"
4,Engaging food set!,My son (2 yrs old) really enjoys this set. It makes a toddler feel like they are doing something that normally they wouldn't be allowed to do (like cut up food with a knife). The food is stuck together with velcro and the (dull) wooden knives are able to cut up the food.
2,Color is not indelible; it effaces with minimal play,"My daughter (34 months old) loves this cutting board set, but major problem: the color rubs off these wooden toys onto hands, clothes and the cutting board itself is stained with color from the vegetables. Melissa and Doug claims the paint is non-toxic."
3,Average purchase,"I purchased this set for my 14 month old boy. He seemed intrigued by it at first. But he cant manage to ""cut"" the vegetables with the knife provided. So all he does is take them apart by hand and throws them around :) He thinks the tomato is a ball and throws it in the air! Maybe he'll like it when he is a bit older."
5,Great for 2-year-old helpers!,"My 2-year-old loves this set and plays with it every day! She always wants to help in the kitchen, but there are only a few things she can safely do. This set was a great way for her to learn to cut things. Now she can help me chop soft things."
1,"Fumes, fumes and more fumes","My daughter seems to enjoy it but I'm very disappointed by the fumes--which makes me believe that the paint is not eco-friendly and/or has not off-gassed yet. I spent a bit more and bought the PLAN cuttable foods and there is no smell. If this is a concern, I would definitely buy PLAN. Going forward, I will no longer use M & D products--everything smells unless it's used for awhile and has off gassed."
4,Great toy for 2-3 year-olds,"This was my 2.5 year-old's favorite toy at preschool, so we bought one for home. He loves cutting up the vegetables. It's good for practicing coordination, counting, colors, etc."
4,Definite Improvement in my WiFi !,"Definitely increased the amount of networks I pick up. I usually connected to about 3-5 networks and now I the option of connecting to over 13 !!!! The only downside to this product, is that its very fragile. I recommend securing it."
4,USB extension helped performance,"I was disappointed at first, until I plugged it into a 10 ft [also 15 ft] USB extension. It now works for me. I think the extension simply gives more latitude for antenna placement, and finding a signal. Be careful handling this plastic device."
1,No Driver Available for Win 7,"Be aware that the latest driver is for Windows Vista. They have newer products, but they will always lag on driver release to try to get you to buy new hardware."
3,Don't know for sure since it doens't work on what i have,"I kinda mucked up when I bought this on amazon, I actually thought it worked with Mac.There are so many different versions, I ended up clicking the wrong one I guess. But it doesn't work on mac 10.6 and so I finally got a PC, and go figure, doesn't work on Win7 either. Like WTF, can't something like this be made tech agnostic like a modem. So, I spent $75 for nothing. Anyone want to buy it?"
3,Not bad if you have a few hours,"O.K., so it took several hours of constant adjustments to get the right aim, but when it did it gets a very good signal which is at least 3 times better than my super G wireless card. It is highly sensitive to position and aim, so have some patience with it. It has made the difference between getting no signal and getting a very good signal."
1,"Very Disapponted - Does not work, etc",I had previously purchased an HWU54D and love it ! This model never functioned properly and the software could not be completely removed from one of my desktops.I will not purchase this model again.
4,Hawking 8db USB dish,"Most of the time my laptop can get a strong wifi signal but due to the far distance away from the Station, the laptop is not able to emit a powerful enough signal to communicate with Station.The Hawkings 8db dish really works, it boost and improves the signal from my laptop to the station and I'm able to get and receive signals even when I'm 200m away.The only disadvantage is , u have to know the direction of where the signal is coming from. or the Hawking will not be able to preform."
2,No so good,"No so good functionality, inferior performancesoftware was no good, a lot installation problems, dont'n worked under Vista Home Primium 64 bits."
2,Great material - Terrible remastering,"This review regards only the ""Future Games"" CD from the two disc set. I had no interest in the ""Spirit of 84"" CD when making my purchase. Such a fine album deserved a better transfer to the digital format. This remaster is not good, great, or average. It is terrible. All the sonics are gone and they were an important part of the original recording. Some tracks don't sound like they are from the original master tapes used on the LP. I consider ""Future Games"" second only to ""The Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus"" in the Spirit catalog. That recording got a great MFSL treatment from Japan. ""Future Games"" got butchered by BGO from England. As an aside, all the discs I have on BGO are inferior to their original vinyl versions. I suppose they fill a niche, but they do it a disservice."
5,Holiday in the sun,This was a great purchase! I love this movie and missed getting to watch it whenever I wanted! Definitely getting lots of use!
3,I'M AN OLSEN FAN,THIS MOVIE IS NOT ONE OF THEIR BEST MOVIE. I DIDN'T LIKE IT VERY MUCH. IT'S LIKE AN 1 HOUR AND 1/2 MUSIC VIDEO.
1,I Hate the Olsen Twins,"I was forced to watch this movie at my friend's slumber party lst night. Let me start off by saying I don't like the Olsen twins. .... Okay, now that I have gotten that out of the way, here's what I think of the video. D-U-M-B!!! So what. Alex and Madison go off to a vacation in the Bahamas and make out with boys. They're only fifteen! Boys this, boys that. Too many of them! This movie is just a waste of your time and money. Unless you like to make out."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"The box works for the purpose. The issue I have is with the materials and quality of assembly. If the diamond plate material was any thinner you could see through it which makes the entire box very flexible. The rivets through the piano hinge for the lid are loose and some are not installed through all the pieces. The sticker inside indicates it passed QC Inspection, this tells me the inspector didn't look at it or the Quality standards are very loose. I'm sad to say, Made in the USA."
3,Good and Bad,"I've had this product for 3 days. First day I got it, I put it on the outside of my bedroom window, minutes later it feel to the ground. Luckily it didn't break or chip, so I guess it's kinda durable in a sense. Then I tried it again with some vaseline and it has been suctioned to the window ever since. Visually, it's no problem to see the temperature during the day, but at night, you might as well not even bother looking at it because the numbers are impossible to see."
4,You Can Go Home Again (But Beware the Consequences)!,"Lynn Schulman moves with her family back to her hometown of Riverside, NY and finds herself wrapped up in the murder of a friend. The lead detective turns out to be a former boyfriend and as the case unfolds, Lynn finds herself more involved than she would like. With more depth than the average murder mystery, this book illustrates how past history affects the present."
3,Hot & Cold,"This was really fast paced at times & then really slow. The characters were very real to me. But too intense in their difficult interpersonal relationships. I read for escape. The mystery revolving around the story line I really enjoyed & I thought was well done. At the end I was sitting on the edge of my seat, but I also had some questions about it."
5,solid state rules!,"IF you like panzee music this is not for you.These are some of the most intense & extreme artists on the market. If your into the harcore seen I would definately suggest blindside,training for utopia & zao. Every band on solidstate is better musicaly than their contemporaries on the secular market.Whats more is that unlike most bands they actually have something worth singing about."
4,As described,"Came in as described, well packaged, fast shipping. I found they were a bit pricey once I saw them in person. After a few hours of wearing them, they began to hurt and rub the back of the heel. Not made for being on your feet for long periods of time. They are awefully cute though."
1,The worst history book!,"This book was the required text for my high school history class, and as one who regularly reads various texts as a self study method, I must say I was dissapointed with such a faulty book. You can indefinitely tell this book was written by kids, due to many grammatical errors, blatant attempts at humor and sarcasm, and criticsm of textbooks based on their inability to comprehend them. The content is vague,biased and sometimes even wrong. I read the first five chapters and was unable to contiune due to my discontent. If you are someone who prefers simplistic books which withholds information and is written by kids that don't have a degree, then you may enjoy this book, but by no means is this the ""best"" history book. What an egocentric name!"
1,"Poorly written, flippant, needed editing","There is a need for a summary of American history that is interesting and well-written. This is not that book. It is cheap, full of ""nudge-nudge-know what I mean"" references, grammatical errors, spelling errors--a sophomoric effort by sophomores. I was embarrassed to have it in my library, and have given it away."
1,Highly disappointing,"These videos are much dated and did not appeal to me at all even though I have an engineering background. I only watched two tapes (moon landing and challenger) and couldn't stand it anymore. For the moon landing, the narratives were extremely boring, few and uninformative. The pictures were ok, but not worth much without good narration, I found. Challenger tape was more recent but even more boring. For the first 20 minutes all you see is astronauts dressing up in real-time. Then you see the shuttle take off and explode for 1 minute. The last 40 minutes or so present you with an official investigative report produced by NASA which contains so many details that you are bound to fall asleep."
4,Pretty Awesome,"I just bought the BSB's Millennium a few days ago and I really love it. Although the slow songs tend to be a bit mushy, (excluding I Want it That Way and I Need You Tonight) the fast songs are really fun to listen to and very uplifting. I never really liked the Backstreet Boys much before..one of the things that drew me to Millennium was sentimental value for the whole CD (thanks to summer camp) However I'm not going to deny that ""It's Gotta Be You,"" ""Larger Than Life"", etc., are truly good songs. Awesome work, BSB. You rock."
1,This CD is horrible,"This cd is horrible,Why do i think that,you may ask. These people are just little boys who try to be cool with their NEW KIDS music! If you want some real music, i say you should pick up KoRn,Limp Bizkit,Fear Factory,Or another great band not this TEEN BOY fad stuff!!!"
5,Not just for teenyboppers anymore BSB has grown up,As an music listener I am very very picky about my music. Who would think I would by any pop album especially by a supposed boy group. Well you are all wrong. If they are a boy group I think we need to re-debate that. BSB new CD is lyrically sound and melodic beats keep you humming away. I have not changed this CD since I got it 38 days ago and I never do that. The adult population is listening and we like the music these five vocalist have produced this time around. It is worth the buy.
1,a honest review..,"i suppose i'll never be able to respect musicians who do not write their lyrics or compose their lyrics, but this album goes way overboard the boring label. in an unoriginal, confusing mix of techno, ballads, rock and mainly pop, this album in one word? terrible."
2,Bland-O-Rama,"I have enough heart to say that this album isn't a disaster, but even by a pure pop standard, ""Millennium"" falls short. The single ""I Want it That Way"" is definitely first-rate, with its memorable chorus and mid-tempo groove. The same can be said for the pleasant, if slightly cheesy, ""Larger Than Life."" Elsewhere, things get patchy and the songs, for the most part, begin to sound the same. No doubt BSB are a halfway-decent singles boyband, but they have yet to make a consistent album. Will they ever? Time will reveal."
5,Not Bad!,"I bought this CD for my pre-schooler (yes, pre-schooler). He's a fan and knows all the words to some of the songs. He heard their songs on the car radio and just seemed to gravitate to their music. He has even adopted some of their moves. I can honestly say I like some of their songs, especially the first three on this CD. We listen to this CD together and it's not bad (from a Mom's perspective). All in all, this is a very good CD. The Backstreet Boys appeal to many audiences."
5,Jan's Thoughts,"I never thought BSB could do better than their first album, but Millennium does just that. Every song on this album is terrific. I Want It That Way is beautiful and the Greatest Fan is a wonderful tribute to all moms. In my mind, the Backstreet Boys are the greatest group on the scene today."
1,Teen trap,"These guys use catchy melodies and lyrics that touch the hearts of anyone that's lyrically challenged to suck money from teens and their parents. Most of the bboys fans that hate me now will understand my point in a few years. Fans--- find music that can feed your brain, not music that will feed your heart and hormones only."
1,no talent,"anyone can sing but to play and sing at the same time is something the bsb can't do,this requires talent something the bsb do not have.ths cd has songs on one subject only where is the diverse writing skills.you can't progress musically if you don't play,look at new kids on the block,boyz to men,and nsync bands with no music ability.i suggest listening to led zeppelin a group who actually made their own music and it is still being played and will still be played when we are gone and when are chidren are gone too.bsb won't even be remembered.just look at the reviews of any any led zeppelin cd."
2,not quite...,"Ok, so I may not be a huge Backstreet Boys fan - but I've got two step-sisters who listen to this album constantly and I have to admit some of the tunes got stuck in my head. The Boys, to be fair, do the up-beat, up-tempo tracks pretty well, perhaps better than most of the other boy-bands out there, and Larger Than Life probably is the best of the bunch. On the other hand, they are not so adept at tackling the slower, slushy numbers. These tended to be plaintive at best, but at worst pathetic. The lyrics are just awful! In all, the album's good if you can fast forward through the ballads, but there are too many of them to save Millennium from getting any more than two stars from me. Sorry!"
4,not just a boy band,"ok ok ok, i'll admit, i found this album very good. i'm not a little teeny-bobber, i'm a 16 year old guy. this album was given to me by my girlfriend, and i can't complain, ""i want it that way"" is an awesome love song, and the other songs have talent in them. Hopefully this will prove they are more than just a ""boy band"""
1,turn it off,"My two little girls bought this album yesturday and to me, its more dangerous than anything by Marylin manson, Alice Cooper or Motley Crue. Kids are in danger of having no musical appreciation when listening to this."
5,Duh! It's the hottest boy band alive!,"I discovered BSB in 7th grade and I can't get enough! On the day Millennium came out, my class was on a feild trip and I had the wait the next day to get it. I like ""I want it that way"" the best because you get to hear a each boy's voice at least once. The cover has awsome pictures of all of them with their faovrite element: Nick-water, Brian-sky, AJ-sun, Howie-fire, and Kevin-steel. I listen to this every day!"
2,Boy Bands..,"The only song I can stand on this album is ""Larger Than Life"", for its upbeat, get-you-dancing mood. Don't waste your money on this CD if you're looking for something with quality and variety. I myself would recommend going to any 3rd party MP3 site and taking advantage of the record company by downloading the CD, rather than paying 16.95 for it. ;)"
5,Oh my goodness. The BEST!,"The Backstreet Boys are cool, and this album is one of the best releases of 1999. I'm so excited right now, I can't even finish this review, so I'll stop here."
1,You have my pity,"To all the the little girls who are too blind and narrow-minded to see that this, as well as almost any other pop record out there, is nothing but meaningless drivel falling out of cute (but amazingly shallow) mouths and who are unable to open yourself and your mind to meaningful music, have my pity. I want you to know that you are missing out on so much beautiful music by settling for this schlock. I beg you, for your sake, that you stop listening to this and pick up a record from some real musicians like Radiohead, The Doors, Pink Floyd, Portishead, and even some classical stuff. Until then, you have my pity."
1,May I say Baaaaaarf?,"I am so disgusted with this type of music, the so-called 'boys bands.' To begin with these talentless morons are not bands (they wouldn't know how to play the maraccas) and their voices (or as their legions of brainless fans call them 'harmonies') are simply the product of computer programing and studio work. I can't believe that this trash has found such a lofty place in American culture. When they first came out they were 'cute' but please! People, buy yourselves a brain or some taste! My tasteless little sister played this album until she had a brain concusion. This is garbage, God I just wanna barf."
1,if you like this you suck,"Honestly, the backstreet boys are one of the major threats to our society. they foster teenage girls into carefree, ignorant zombies who couldnt spot a threat if it bit them. Please dont buy this, i beg you to be more responsible."
2,over-rated,the songs r ok---not so nice yet does not deserve to be hits because the songs lack emotions--very superficial sorry for all boybands lovers for this frank comment
4,Music That'll Have You Dancin' The Night Away!,"This is an awesome CD! I had ""I Want It That Way"" stuck in my head for days! (It's that good!) ""The Perfect Fan"" is really sweet. It shows how much the group loves and appreciates their moms."
1,Not as Good as The first one,"When I first got this cd I was glad cuz they were finally done with it. When I heard ""I want it that way"" I thought the cd was going to be cool but I was wrong.They have to many slow song except for larger than life and It's Gotta Be U. Anyways if u guys want to buy it go ahead."
2,A word from CANADA,"Well I heard the cd. It's pretty good. I probably would enjoy it [the Backstreet Boys] better if people didn't make such a big deal about the new cd coming out or the group. I mean, talking about it was fine, but having a Backstreet Boy's Day, on the release day, was going over board."
3,Good,Although I've never heard the whole CD I like what I have heard. And even though I am a big pop fan I think lots of people can enjoy it.
1,I'd give it 0 but I cants,"Listen everything u hear on this crap u can hear on the first horable album or a old New Kids song. It totaly lacks originality and soul. really how many women have these guys been ""in love with"" none so basicaly what thier sayn' is a bunch of BS"
5,Backstreet Boys the BEST!,"This CD is another great CD from the Backstreet Boys as the others! This CD is not only 5 stars but a million, billion, trillion well, you guys know how many stars! Backstreet boys RUELZ! Brazil loves you guys, Backstreet Boys! I love you all also!"
4,Enter the Millenium with MILLENIUM!,"This CD is like a new beginning for the Backstreet Boys. They have refined their voices even though they were great before. The songs on this album are really a part of them and they put a lot of wotk into their music. They are hot, talented guys that definitely deserve some credit for doing what they love to do as well as making other people smile.This album has great listening music on it including slow songs as well as upbeat ones."
1,Maybe the worst album EVER,"Wow. I had no idea that an album could be this bad. The songs have no meaning whatsoever, they didn't write the songs they sing thus they aren't expressing any emotions or opinions. Total bubblegum music (music that's main sales are from kids below the age of 18 or girls). I'm not sure why anyone would be looking at buying this album. It's horendous, mind-boggling. I have no words to describe how corny this ""band"" is. Yes, their voices sound good if you like that kind of sining, but that's not why their records sell, plenty of other artists have great voices and few of them are what the backstreet boys are, popularity wise. However, (thank god almighty) they aren't popular anymore. Instead, a band who might be even WORSE is leading the way for pop music, Nsync. Please, help me and others who can't stand these kinds of bands. Put Nirvana and Greenday and Weezer and the Smashing Pumpkins back atop the charts. Let's have another grunge explosion, PLEASE!"
5,You must buy Millenium form the BSB!,"This is a very cool album from the BSB. They have a mix of different types of music such as the slow melody ones and the more upbeat ones. Slower soothing songs are ""Back to your Heart"" written by Kevin and ""No One Else Comes Close"" and ""I Need You Tonight"" which was mostly sung by Nick's sweet voice. The faster songs are ""Larger Than Life"" ,which is a song co-written by Brian and is a song dedicated to the BSB fans, ""Don't Want you Back"",""It's Gotta Be You"",and ""The One"".Those songs you can play over and over again and never get sick of it.It also has the famous No.1 hit ""I want It That Way"". ""The Perfect fan"" is another sweet song written by Brian dedicated to his mom.Aawww... how sweet of Brian.It's a great album to get for Mother's Day to play that song for her which can show our love for our mothers. P.S The BSB sure can swoon anyone with their oh so sweet voices that harmonizes so well together.Hope You will all enjoy the album as much as I did! BSB 4EVA!"
4,Not bad,"When I really started getting into pop music, this was the first cd i bought. I listened to it for two months straight - nothing else. So what kind of a cd does it have to be to be good enough to be able to listen to it for that long without a break? Also, this is definitely the best Backstreet cd. If you want to get a Backstreet Boys cd, this should be the first one to get."
2,It's ok.... for a boyband,"Let me start off by saying the Backstreet Boys are alright musicians. 2/3 of them can sing, whereas the rest sound like screechng cats. However, in my opinion Millenium has too many slow songs, for my liking. Precisely 8 out of 12. More than half. "" Show me the meaning of being Lonely"" is too depressing, Larger than Life was the best song on the album, until it got played out by MTV. My favorite songs are ""Gotta be You"" and for a slow song, "" No One Else Comes Close"". But, millions of prepubescent girls probaly disagree with me, and thats fine. I'll just keep listening to their first album instead, and pull out Millenium when I'm in a bad mood, and need a good laugh, all I have to do is think of Nick's prepubescent voice singing ""I'm your bad boy""."
5,One you'll wanna listen to over and over!,"This a great cd! I love all the songs on there! It's kinda funny, because when I got it as a present i wanted to give it away to one of my friends but they all had it. So I decided to listen to it. I was blown away, because every single track on there was SO great! Everyone, young and old will like this! Also, it sort of bugs me when people say that they aren't good because they don't write their own songs or play their own instruments. Lighten up people! If what they are doing makes people smile, what's wrong with that? A friend of mine likes listening to 'It's Gotta Be You' just because it makes her feel happy! People don't need to take it that seriously!"
2,Um . . .,"I just wanted to say that I FEEL (many others don't), that ""I Want It That Way"" is an overrated song, and I think the songs on this CD sound very much the same, which is okay, I suppose. And, most importantly to me, BSB's music is SO DIFFERENT from *NSYNC's. Thank you, I needed to express that. :)"
5,BSB~Millennium,"Hi Amazon customers,I think this CD is great I've had it since 1999 and I still play it at least once every week. I'm a huge BSB fan. For all you BSB haters I really think you should actually listen closely to thier music before you criticize them. I LOVE this CD!!And I love their first and third CDs also. I have them all!"
5,Excellent! Anbody w/out it...needs to go out and buy it!,"This CD; I have been a backstreet boys fan for awhile, not only because they are sweet people but they have wonderful harmonizing skills and beautiful voices. The second CD, i wasn't planning to buy, but when I did it surprised me on the quality! VERY WELL DONE BSB! Keep puttin' out records that match your rep and you're guranteed sucess!"
2,A DISAPPOINTMENT,This cd is not like the first one.I only like ''LARGER THAN LIFE'' and ''I WANT IT THAT WAY''.That's why I gave it two stars.My favorite Backstreet boy is Nick.I hate all the others.
2,Attack of the pretty boys..,"The Backstreet Boys are cute. That's about all i'll give them. Their c.d. isn't all that bad, if you want regurgitated, reiterated, non original songs lacking a true purpose. Honestly, they barely make sense. Maybe in your eyes, but I can't find a meaning in any of them. Their songs are made up of silly, transparent, apathetic and emotionless lyrics and melodies used to hook pre-teen girls, which evidently they have. Take my advice and get Ben Folds Five, the goo goo dolls, or Semisonic and listen to some real music. And maybe you'll decide that there is actually a music world outside of them. Sooner or later you are going to grow up."
2,An over-rated album coming up short,"The new Backstreet Boys CD ""Millenium"" just doesn't cut it. It lacks originalty BIG TIME. All the songs sound so similar that none of them are able to stand out. In addition to this lackluster of an album, where are the upbeat tempo of songs that have made them so famous? How are they gonna dance on tour when all their songs are slow. Please someone gives these guys a clue before its too late. There is a lot of potential, but they just don't possess it just quite yet. Perhaps it has to do with their writing contribution to the songs. BACKSTREET BOYS sorry to say but leave it to the professionals!"
5,It touched my heart.,"This cd is the perfect cd. All the tracks are first rate and I was really impressed by the maturity of the guys' voices. I became a fan of the bsb after listening to Backstreet Boys(Their second Cd). There were one or two song in that cd that I was not so impressed with. I thought it was a bit on the teeny bopper side of music. Millennium on the other hand is a cd with class.All the songs are great. I recently bought the cd and I think it's wonderful that I don't have skip tunes because they don't seem to coincide with my mood. Just to set the record straight, I am a 34 year old school teacher who is very picky about her choice in music. I would encourage any oldie like myself to buy Millennium. Once there is a heart beating in your body, this music will reach it. So go buy it already!"
2,Interesting!!,"I am shocked. I have hated the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC for so long because all they are is $$ and girltoys. I have to say, Millenium is a whole new thing. I have only heard Larger Than Life and I Want It That Way, but i love them both. They are the only two songs I like from these two groups, give or take a few. I will never be a DRONE to BSB or NSYNC. I will be faithful to Dave Matthew's Band and The Bobs. The BSB and NSYNC will not take over my mind!! Still, those two songs were good."
5,bsb are larger than life!,"I just bought this album and I listen to it all the time!The best songs are ""show me the meaning of being lonely"",""don't wanna lose you now"" and ""spanish eyes""!The songs are so sweet they make me cry!Ilove to listen to Howie and Brian's voices!I also like ""it's gotta be you"" and ""larger than life""!Great dance songs.so if your looking for talent and great music I highly recommend ths album! p.s. Ilove you Howie!"
4,kick nick,"this is a grrrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaatttttt cd. A.J. and Howie sound awesome, (big) But nick carter has way too many solos. Otherwise excellent material. Stronger than their last album."
5,Amazingly enough....I loved it!,"I really didn't care for BSB until they came out with this album. It has a great compilation of songs, from slow to upbeat. I listen to it at work practically every day....and I am not sick of it."
5,This CD is GREAT,"I wasn't too crazy about the BsB's first album, but as soon as i heard I want it that was i bought millenium. its GREAT. They're not at all a teenybopper band, at least on this cd. They have really mature voices, and I LOVE their new image. O yeah, and look at the pics of Kevin on the inside--HE IS THE HOTTEST MAN ALIVE"
2,"Same old,Same old","Okay,they got a little more original.But the songs they helped write sucked!This whole album sucked more than the first.All the songs sound exactly the same as each other.The tempo changes,but it is still basically the same.Now I know why my mother told me that some people can really be mentally backwards.The lyrics are so unintelligent,so empty.This record will bring them success,but it will also be their eventual demise."
5,Backstreet Boys rule,"Backstreet boys are the best! I am just about the only one of my friends that still like them . One of them likes them + N Sync. But, i'm the only one that likes them , I don't really N Sync. I like a lot of other bands just not N Sync. I have a riend that is ostantly telling me that she really doesn't like them. But, Millenium is my favorite cd, and Backstreet Boys are the Best! They have very good songs, that have great meanings."
1,Corporate manufactured garbage,"Please, all this album is meant for is selling t-shirts, posters, and tickets to kids who dont know any better. Anybody who calls this fluff ""rock"" better start listening to Clapton, The Beatles, Zeppelin, Pearl Jam, even Elvis...THATS rock folks, not this corporate fluff. Sorry, I cant respect any group that doesnt write their own material or play instruments on their albums. 1 star because there is no zero star rating. Open your eyes kids, theyre emptying your wallet right in front of your eyes."
5,i listen to it over and over.,"This is one of my older Cds that i decided to come back and review as i realised i hadent given it all the praise that it deserves. This is a realy great CD, it has the most amazing songs on it, there all good but the best of the best include ""the one"", ""i want it that way"" and ""show me the meaning of been lonely"" This is not just for teenage girls, you know how much i like it, and my dad likes it more than me!"
2,BSB needs to get rid of Nick,"Now, I'm glad That I never had any need to ever get this CD, but since my sister got it I gave it a spin. The reason I gave it 2 stars, were for the 2 songs Nick didn't have a leading part. Sorry BSB would sound 100% better without the boy. Sure everyone thinks he looks good , but really he has brown hair and is BUTT ugly without his Makeup. Another reason this CD was bad was the fact that they still don't write their own songs. Sure Brain and Kevin have credits but they had a real song writer help them, and they only write lyrics not Music. So If they get rid of Nick and learn to really write song, they will begin to get more respect, From everyone who is not a girl between 8-25."
5,Millennium,"OMG, I only have good things to say about this CD. Every song is fabulous! Although it took me a while to adjust to I Need You Tonight, now I love it. (Even though, if you've ever heard any of their import songs, it's the song Heaven In Your Eyes, with a different title.)Someone asked me which was my favorite song and I had to really think about it. I would have to say, Don't Wanna Lose You has to be my favorite, and that was a VERY hard choice because I love them all.Brian Littrel, God I love the way that man sings. He has been blessed with a magnificant voice! So Brian L. if you ever read this, your voice is soooooo soothing!I highly recommend this CD. Buy it, you won't regret it."
5,Enjoyable,"I cannot wait for their next album! They have proved to the world that they can still be a great boy band. Many of these songs are much like the songs from their last c-d, but they are different in many ways, too. I loved all of the tracks, but my favorite was ""I Want It That Way,"" because they use all of their beautiful voices."
3,the cd is okay,the backstreet boys's cd is cool but there are not much of dance songs to dance to. although the bsb are totally hot nomader how there music.
5,One of the best CD's I have bought in a while,"The is not your ordinary CD. It has songs for just about everyone! Im not usually a pop fan, I haven't really listented to my ""POP"" cd's for a while, but when I herd their new single ""I want it that way"" I fell inlove with the song right away, and just had to have the CD. I have 2 copies of it( My first copy was ruined :o( )and I like listen to it every day. I mean ya can't really say enough good stuff about this cd, it has everything from great dance songs like ""Larger than Life"" to soulfull ballads like ""Perfect Fan"". I luv this cd and I reccomend this to everyone...young and old.....people who like all kinds of music."
5,AWESOME!,"Hey, I'm an 18-year-old guy and I've been a Backstreet Boys fan for a while. I have all three of their albums and I have to say that all of them are REALLY GOOD!! Millennium, however, is an awesome album. The boys have really matured. Every song on this album is soooooo good. As well, the fact that they co-wrote some of the songs and co-produced the album, they are much more credited. GOOD JOB GUYS, KEEP IT UP!"
2,Best of the boy bands...,"...which is not saying much. I have a strong aversion to the groups of five or so guys who can't sing, for the simple fact that their songs are not real music. However, I found myself enjoying some of the Backstreet Boys' melodies, even if the lyrics are not extremely creative and were likely spit out by a bubblegum-pop generator. The songs are more enjoyable than many by other ""teenybopper"" artists; I would not buy this album but I give the Boys credit for not being completely horrible."
4,Great music,"I like this cd for its different fast and slow songs.I think this is a CD for most anyone,it has great sound,great artists and good lyrics.So in my opionion if you like anything even close to this music you should buy the CD."
1,THE BIGGEST WASTE OF CD MEDIA EVER!,"I can't belive the junk this ""band"" produces. They have no musical talent and just pray of young people. thank god they are just a fad and this will not go down in history as great music. I hope that the company that put this out goes broke so they will not beable to unleash this plage upon us. After you hear this music you will see why kids today are so depressed. readrider P.S. If you want some good music find some Sinatra"
5,Very Well Made,"This CD is great. It plays the mood of music you want. If you craving for music, you can get real rock, like Larger Than Life. If you want calm music, the CD will be there to calm your CD. It's a must."
1,Thank god the boy band era is done...,"Beck in 1999, you couldn't get away from boy bands. Their cheesy manufactured computerized songs were everywhere. It seemed like you can't get away from them. Thankfully now in 2004, they are all gone or forgotten. This is just a reminder for everyone to say that this crap still sucks and you still need to stay away from it."
3,Its OK,this was an ok CD but the NSYNC CD was a lot better! Half of the songs were ballads and I am not really crazy with ballads
3,BackStreet Boys New Cd,"This cd is full of nice dance beats but i would have to say that they have a lot of slow songs to me. i think they should make the songs even amount. half slow songs, half fast songs. I'm really tired of people complaining about BsB and N SYNC they are people and i don't think they are tryin' to copy anyone. i think they are tryin' to find their own style of music. So people Shutup about ""Oh N SYNC is copying BSB."" or the other way around. 'Cause that cluess talk is really buggin' me. But anyways i would recommend this cd to whoever likes a lot of slow songs. If you don't like that much of slow songs i would recommend to you to juss by tha singles. There's also another thing.. Brian L from the BSB wrote most of the songs with other popular song writers and kevin R. But i don't see any of the other BSB's names on the credits fer writing songs. So you probably know who works hard more than anyone in that group."
4,it was not as good as the last but still good.,"It has good songs but no big hits beside "" I want it that way"" but over all it was good."
3,this cd has music on it please buy it,i heard this disc i think it was on the radio and i had to get it it was good if you heard this and you like it too please buy it you will not be disappointed this record really rocks your cd collection is not complete without this cd in fact this may the only cd you need
5,"Excellent read, great illustrations","I enjoyed the concepts, and illustrations that helped to solidify them which Halliday uses. What is especially noted about this grammar as one of the major contributions of SFL is Halliday's concept of transitivity and its relationship to the ideational metafunction of discourse. This was the book that propelled me to dig deeper into sociolinguistics (see Halliday, Language as Social Semiotic) and thinking with an SFL mindset throughout my graduate education in Biblical Studies (MDiv, and MA). Although my application may not appeal to all, the general theory of a functional orientation to linguistic study can be applied across the board of human behavior and sociology. For me, it's the reorientation of putting ""man"" back into the linguistic analysis that sparked my desire.For me, highly recommended."
5,BUY IT NOW!,"I work at a music store and I have seen probably a total of 5 people buy this album since it came out. You people don't know what you have missed. If you like Dead Can Dance's percussion, unique use of instruments and chilling poetry, you will like this album. Brendan Perry shows us his songwriting skills untouched. This album reminded me of a few songs on DCD's ""Into the Labyrinth"" like ""The carnival is over"" and ""Tell me about the forest"". If you like DCD but could do without Lisa Gerrard's somewhat strange vocals, THIS IS THE CD TO BUY! GET IT!"
5,Magnificient,"Long have I desired to have a copy of this marvelous record. Despite the fact Perry's first record after splitting Dead Can Dance is far from the classic sound of the duo, EYE OF THE HUNTER is nothing short of breathtaking. Perry decided for a very intimate and acoustic intrumentation which does not mean the album lacks power and intensity, on the contrary, the record is full of those moments that send shivers down your spine thanks to the sheer depth and emotion of Perry's voice.Some of these tracks have become favourites and are still played live to this day. MEDUSA is one of the saddest and most tragic songs that Perry has ever written and that says a lot. The rest of the album follows the same pattern of acoustic guitar plus some other acoustic instruments like violin, mandolin and flute but never sounds repetitive or boring, far from it.A great record and a great debut solo album."
3,lost maybe? come home brendan!,"i have not purchased this cd yet but just listened to some clips from this site.....i have always loved brendans voice and am glad to say that aspect did not dissapoint me...Iwas introduced to dead can dance 2 years ago and now have all of the albums including the 2 releases from lisa gerrard solo's...There music to me has always been inspirational...I am a musician myself and recognise the raw art that they have created together "" gerrard i think did very well on her own...."" but this album dissapoints me ... i cant speak for brendan but i liked his raw ideas with dcd...maybe this will grow on me and ill come back and correct myself...But i doubt it..I want to cry :-("
1,not too fresh,"This product arrived on 12.29.2009 but the expiration date is 07.2010. Although it still has 7 months to get expired, I just can't believe the bottles stayed in somewhere else for 3 years before it got to my place. I'd rather grab it in CVS or RiteAid next time."
1,not as described,"It said ""one 220-count bottle"" in the product features, but I got two 110-bottles, with additional labels over the expiration date areas. I don't know if my vitamin is fresh or not, and feel being cheated..."
1,BAD. PRODUCT,"I ordered 2 220-count bottles of centrum silver, instead i received 4 110-count bottles. each bottle had the expiration date PILLED OFF. and they put their own labels over the place where they had pilled off the expiration date! i contacted AMAZON and they refunded me. i got same vitamins for a better price in a store."
1,Very bad shopping experience,"The items I received are totally different from the picture.According to the introduction on the website, it's "" One bottle of 220 adult vitamin supplement tablets"", but actually it's ""Two bottles of 110 tablets with old package"". The more terrible thing is that no expiry date can be found on bottle. The back of the bottle sticked an extra label where usually printed with expiry date. When the label is moved, I find the corner is intentionally torn off.When communicate with the seller, I'm very very very indignant with his/her attitude. He/She can't give me any information about the expiry date and said that never happened!!!! Such a liar!!!!!"
2,"Received two small bottles instead of one,and No expire date could be found.","I purchased a bottle of 220 tablets, but actually I received two bottles of 110 tablets.There are no expiry date can be found on the two bottles. The back of the bottle sticked an extra label where usually printed with expiry date,when the label was moved, I found the corner is intentionally torn of.Does that mean the vitamins already expire? How can I konw the expire date? I have to stop my father from taking it."
1,Contains Aspartame,I purchased a bunch of these and now need to throw them out. It's my fault and I should have done my homework first. How can you make a vitamin and flavor it with a neurotoxin? I hope Centrum takes it out of the product and I would give it a shot again.
1,Oh how I've been fooled,"For so long I thought Centrum Silver was the best thing I could get. Why not? Mens Health recommends it and it seems to have everything I need. Well Centrum is BY FAR THE WORST MULTIVITAMIN anyone can take. And don't just take it from me. Read The UltraMind Solution, or Revive, or any book about taking toxins out of your body. Any active form of vitamin they recommend you should definitely not take, it's all inside a Centrum. EVERY SINGLE ONE. Centrum is a big company that could care less about what's inside your body. I'm warning you now, there's much better multivitamins out there, just do some research and you won't regret it."
1,Deceptive product,"What I received did not conform to the product description. Also, the expiration date was passed. I wish I had not wasted my money. I just trashed them and I will not buy any other product from this seller."
1,Very cheap...,"I was given one of these for Christmas and I'm not impressed. It's a cheaply made product that falls apart easily. I'm not sure what the appeal of this item is, ok it may be helpful to quickly shave strays in between your eyebrows, but that's about it. If you use this to shave your facial fuz like they show on tv, you will get stubble as you would with any other shaver. It sits in a drawer and I'm sure it will fall apart soon just by doing that."
1,Not worth it,This product did not do a thing for me. I had to keep running it back and forth over my skin and finally it took off a few hairs. I was not impressed
1,Literally fell to PIECES!,Literally fell to PIECES in my hand. The pivoting was the worst after a few pivots it fell into about 5 pieces.Buy the Conair they last & actually work!
3,Not so good,Not all that good will not buy again shipping was fast but not what I was looking for does not trim all that well so will not buy again.
1,Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!,Tried using this and after the first time I tossed it out! I used it specifically for all over my bikini area and it pulled and yanked my hair out...Ouch! Definitely would NOT recommend this item:(
3,"Work well, but not a close shave","It works well on the face and the hair does not grow back thicker. I use it on my upper lip. The down side is that it doesn't get a close enough shave, so you feel the stubble right after using it."
5,Great CD,Excellant CD! Has some of Jerry Lee Lewis bset songs. I would recomend this CD to anyone who likes Jerry Lee!!!
2,Egg slicer,"Wires don't pass far enough through grid to slice all the way through the egg, so quite a bit of egg white gets left behind. It's really only a problem on a double cut dice not so much with a single slice through."
2,Hunter Air Filters,They were great except they aren't Hunter! They were generic and I was expecting the name brand.
3,Only Large enough for one Filter,As a couple of others have already mentioned this replacement cut-to-order filter is only large enough to get one replacement filter out of rather than the two stated on the box. Purifier Model 30547 needs a 19.5 x 13.5 pre-filter to completely cover the Hepa filter. Anything smaller will allow dust directly into the Hepa filter shortening it's life considerably. Pre-filter 30901 is the designated part to replace the original for this model.
1,DON'T BE DECIEVED - CHEAP AND DOESN'T FIT,"Beware of buying this filter for your Permalife 30546 or 30547. First, the filter is significantly thinner than the Permalife-supplied original filter. Second, the webbing is much less dense the original (so don't expect it to catch as much particulate matter). Third, there's no evidence of any carbon filter material, and that's probably because there isn't any. Finally, you have to cut it to fit. While not terribly difficult, this isn't a product you can easily mark with lines for cutting, and it's not just a matter of cutting the length to fit: you have to cut along both axis. Totally worthless. The people giving this 4 and 5 stars must use their filter as a placebo, LOL."
4,good product,It works pretty well in my window unit AC in Iraq. I cut a sheet in half so there is enough for two uses. I should have read more thoroughly since I was looking for a reusable prefilter but the charcoal activation seems to keep odors out of my CHU.
4,Revelation,recommend this book because it addess the number one problem in USA Christians - head knowledge over heart knowledge - the Bible is the writen Word made Flesh and still lives among us - that we can have a personal relationship with Jesus - I have not finished the book BUT what I read has me moved to live a life to Him - if you are looking for a book on time tables about the end - this is not for you
4,Good collection,"I enjoyed this collection of varied stories, but in my opinion nothing captures the China adoption experience like Karin Evans' The Lost Daughters of China. Readers seeking information on China adoption would do well to try both books, I think. And for the nitty gritty on background and issues concerning international adoption from China, I recommend yet another book, Laura Cecere's The Children Can't Wait."
5,Great Classics,This set comes with 15 DVDs - 15 Classical movies.Unfortunately Amazon did not provide any information. I bought it from somewhere else with a much cheaper price.The set comes in a very beautiful box with beautiful ladies.Here are the movies in case you were wondering:Disc 1: AnastasiaDisc 2: All About EveDisc 3: The Best of EverythingDisc 4: Blood and SandDisc 5: CleopatraDisc 6: Desk SetDisc 7: Gentlemen Prefer BlondesDisc 8: The Girl Can't Help ItDisc 9: How To Steal A MillionDisc 10: LauraDisc 11: Peyton PlaceDisc 12: My Blue HeavenDisc 13: One Million Years B.C.Disc 14: The Rains CameDisc 15: The Snake PitI would recommend buying this.
3,"Close, but no Cigar","This book is riveting and provided fascinating new information about Paul Laurence Dunbar and Alice Moore Dunbar. At the same time, it scratches the surface in too many places, relying on feminist cliches instead of substantive analysis. This is clearly a dissertation that was published with out the skilled editing that allows the author to reach new conclusions. Too many times, I feel that a window had been opened for me to get a glimpse into lives, then swung shut before insights had been fully explored."
4,family fun,"This is a good family yoga video. My kids (10, 8, 4) do this with me and there's something for everyone. Some of it is a bit cheesy, and I get the feeling that the lady is a bit uncomfortable on camera, but it's still well done."
1,Worst light ever,"I would never buy this product again. The bulb went out after 2 uses, and is not very easy to replace. I just ended up throwing it in the trash."
1,What a piece of crap..... I'd give ZERO stars if I could....,"This thing didn't even last until I got the rebate check back.... the drive itself is fine... the USB interface just stopped working.... Please see Seagate's website for their very restrictive warranty return policies (It's almost as though you can void your warranty by taping the box left-handed AND they link you to another site where you're invited to BUY the correct materials to ship your drive back to them). I consider their warranty return competely useless (No data recovery without an exorbitant fee, even though the drive itself is not the problem.... and you get a ""reconditioned"" drive, not the one you sent back....) BEWARE!! My first and absolute LAST Seagate purchase......."
5,ATTRACTIVE and efficient,"Any objection for using this cover rests only in the size of the pot or pan to be covered together with the angle the handle makes as it rises over the rim.Hold the pot or pan to be covered at profile to eye level. If the handle rises over the rim, the cover will not fit snugly.For pots and pans that do fit, this cover is excellent. Note that the largest diameter limit is 12"" (or more)."
4,quality lid,"Got this lid for a Circulon Infinite 11"" pan and it fits nicely.Seems to be good quality, not flimsy stainless and the adjustable vent is a nice add on."
1,Bad Design,"Try putting this lid on a 7"" pot. Most all pots have handles that slant upwards. This lid will not fit tightly. There is a gap. Also, if you are cooking something on the next burner the lid is so wide it hits the other pot. This item was returned by me."
2,It is NOT universal--not recommended,"Was hoping to use this lid on several skillets I got that came without lids. It is way too big and cumbersome, bulky for the big pans and just does not work with the smaller pans. Won't work on pans where the handle goes up even a little.Therefore, it is definitely not a universal lid.I'm sorry I chose this lid.I also don't like the stainless steel as you can't see what you are cooking, but I did understand it was stainless; just thought it would fit all my skillets.I do not recommend purchasing this as a universal lid."
1,Universal piece of crap,"If you have a pot, something that you would cook pasta in, this will be fine. If you are buying this for a frying pan, DO NOT BUY IT. It is too big to fit almost any frying pan, so that when you try to put it on the pan, it just hits the frying pan's handle and will not close. Quality seemed to be fine, but I never could use mine bc it did not fit on anything I owned. Universal (lol)."
4,Great Sound,"I put this system on my 86 Iroc-z with a carb 350 and it sounds great and looks just as good as it sounds. Very easy to install and turns a lot of heads. The only thing to watch out for is that the tips slightly angle down rather than straight out but with a little bit of adjustment, I got it to where I wanted it."
4,What are you talking about???,"Very few people have done as much for American Pit Bull Terrier literature than Richard Stratton. He owns, judges, and understands the breed better that any author I have read. Kh'76's lack of understanding of the pit bull is reflected in his grammar and spelling. If Stratton felt that the English Bulldog, American Bulldog, or Tosa was a better fighting breed, he would writing about them. I suggest that he reads the book, The World of the American Pit Bull Terrier and he would understand why the pit bull was the fighting breed of choice for many years and what makes it superior breed. If you don't understand the importance of a game tested dog, I don't suggest his books. I recommend Jesup's, it has pretty pictures."
5,A ton of stuff for a little money,"I got so many discs with this package, was very impressed with the content of the product too. My 5 year old is challenged but not to the point she wants to give up."
1,Very Disappointing,"I thought I had found a book that incorporated my son's cat in relaxation techniques that he could use for home and school. I was REALLY disappointed! This very small book (only about 25 pages) talked more about cats and their reactions to things. I thought that if I worked with my son and his cat I would be able to calm him down when he gets uptight. This book is not intended for that!! In fact, it has very little use other than its descriptions of what cats do and how cats react to certain things. Don't bother with this book if you're looking for specifics on relaxation techniques with your cat."
5,Reader in Denver,"Incredible work! This is THE BEST Enneagram book available, combining the psychology of the personalities with the spiritual force at work in all of our lives. This powerful combination allows the reader to move from mere typing of themselves or others to an actual practice of learning to release him or herself from their ego mind. This book is the real stuff, a true gem from gifted spiritual Teachers who come from a place of understanding."
3,book was very used and i shoud off bought new for e few $$ more,book was very used and i shoud of bought new for e few $$ more. Delivery was on time. Thank you!
4,Good Stuff and Makes Sense,"I have not read the entire book. (Does ANYONE read the ENTIRE book of this kind?). So far, it is RIGHT on the Money for me and a number of my Friends. I like the fact that it is not JUST, ""This is you"". This book also suggests ways to deal with certain parts of your character type. If nothing else, it is FUN to see what ""type"" you are."
4,Practical self assessment book,"Really neat for even beginners, better for people that have already been involved with this philosophy. Once you have narrowed down which one of the 9 types you most likely represent more closely, you start the journey of self improvement. It has helped me greatly - but do not expect fast results. Finding yourself takes time and you may at first mis-diagnose yourself or you may be in a phase of where you transcend from one type to another."
4,Good read,This series is fun to red. I love how the author weaves the same characters throughout each book. They start to seem like old friends
4,Lack of Communication,"That is the running theme in this 3rd installment of the Cedar Cove series. Rosie and Zack are the main characters this time. They have decided to divorce and the ordeal is quickly coming to a head with their children. Maryellen and Jon have decided what is in the best interest of their new born daughter; and Olivia and Jack have finally come to an agreement.More is revealed in the mysterious death at the Beldon's bed and breakfast with the divulging of an incident that Bob witnessed during his Vietnam years. Will this lead to the identification of the mysterious stranger? Are others still in danger? What is the full story?I enjoy this series, revisiting storylines and characters, just wish I hadn't waited so long in between books, forgot who a couple of people were, but Macomber is good at refreshing your memory."
4,CEDAR COVE REVIEW,A VERY NICE SERIES TO READ....I LIKE HOW SHE GOES BACK AND REFRESHES YOUR MEMORY ABOUT PREVIOUS BOOKS IN THE SERIES.
4,great series,"Read from June 04 to 10, 2012I really enjoying the Cedar Cove series. I love the aboundance of warm down to earth characters that make similar mistakes that you & I would make. THe uncertainties, hopes and desires that characters go thru in this series hits very close to home."
2,Informative but boring.,This book didn't base the story on a specific character as a narrator so it was boring. I learned what happened in the American Revolution. I didn't like it very much. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Even if you like learning about the war.
2,Complex read burdened by an awkward translation,"This novel moves from the present to the past and back using a brutal double murder as the crime under consideration. The prose is very descriptive in terms of natural surroundings and densely written reminiscent of the style of Cold Mountain. At times, the story veers off into tangential musings about life, death and like cosmic topics; I did not think these meanderings added much to the story. It takes a tremendous amount of effort to read this book due to the complexity of the plot, the burden of what I believe is a mediocre translation and, ultimately, what to this U.S. reader was unfamiliarity with Swedish/ Norwegian and Lapp culture. I believe that the high praise and awards for this book must largely reflect the taste of readers who read it in its native tongue and understood cultural currents which, lacking prior background, I could not appreciate. If I were to sum it all up, I would subtitle my review as Lost in Translation."
3,Tedious,"In 1974, Annie Raft takes her daughter Mia to small-town Blackwater in northern Sweden, to meet her lover Dan at a commune. When Annie searches for Dan, she instead finds two dead bodies, and spots a man leaving the scene - the same man connected with Mia years later. I read it all, but found it a bit tedious. (C+)"
3,a three today but a 5 in 1967,"Though still interesting, this work was best listened to the the era it was created. At the time it came out there was nothing else like it."
2,Nice but noisy,"Nice design, but the ticking is so loud that I can't have it in the bedroom, which makes it useless as an alarm clock."
4,Nice for the price,"Keeps good time, good alarm (and snooze), backlight on demand illuminates face well, easy to reach snooze on top of clock, nice size clock,and easy to read face. However, the secondhand ""tick, tick, tick..."" is moderately loud. That said, it's really no louder than a key-wind, pendulum type wall clock, and the ticking relatively quickly becomes ""white noise"" (1.e., one ceases to be aware of the ticking noise and it inhibits awareness of other environmental sounds, like traffic etc.). Additionally, this might also be a clock to consider for a baby's room"
5,love this little clock,"I bought one of these clocks almost 8 years ago at the supermarket of all places, and can you believe, it's still perfect, even the little illuminating bulb still works. I needed another one for a guest room, so came looking for that same clock. The original clock is whisper quiet, so I was curious about the reviews. Sure enough, the new one has a faint ticking, though I didn't find it particularly bothersome, but others may be sensitive to the sound. Still, it is a great clock at a great price and was so happy to find it again. By the way, and this probably not at all important, but I did notice that the first clock actually has the word ''quartz'' printed just above the number 6, the new one doesn't."
1,Worst Product Ever Purchased on Amazon,"Bought this as a backup due to multiple power outages. This alarm clock has not properly worked since the first time I tried to put the battery in. The section for the battery does not hold the battery in place so every time you even gently move the clock the battery falls out, including just turning off the alarm. It is a daily routine to reinsert the battery, try to put the also faulty battery cover back on and reset the time; this takes multiple attempts. As it was inexpensive and compact I decided not to return it right away, but now I regret my decision. Wanted to rate it with no stars but system would not let me"
5,"It's good - small, tasty, crunchy, and ""hullless""","I love this popcorn, it's tasty and crunchy and it's my favorite so far. Blue popcorns seem to have more flavor than yellow or white. I think the selling point of this type is that because the kernels are small the hulls shatter when it pops (""hullless""), so that you don't get the big painful pieces of hard popcorn hull in your teeth like with larger varieties. It's not going to be completely hullless but compared to regular large yellow popcorn the hulls are pretty much gone. The resulting popped corn is smaller than you may be used to, though. Try it, it's good!"
3,tough,This corn is very tough and doesn't pop up very well.I need to sit with a paper towel in one hand to spit out all the tough kernels.I won't be buying this corn again.
5,2nd Purchase of Amish Wrought Iron,"I am highly satisfied with the value and quality.For a detailed review from me please refer to the other small wrought iron shelf, not for corners, made and sold by the same people and company, that I submitted a review on earlier today.Highly recommend."
1,Doesn't deserve a publisher,"I read De Angelis's other book which is hilariously bad. Her method for expressing emotions is to use bold face, italics, exclamation points. Sometimes she uses all of them in a single sentence. Her advice is vague and commonsensical: ""Judge a Man by the Size of His Heart, not by the Size of His Wallet"" or ""Look for a Man with Good Character."" Philosophers have debated for ages on what ""good character"" actually is. De Angelis pretends like the debates never took place. Falling in love is complicated business, and De Angelis evades the complexities for the shallower waters of vague cliche and trite observation."
3,Subject for advanced meditator,"This is something you take on retreat. It requires a degree of understanding, compassion and a calm mind to begin with. If you just read the more exciting chapters like those on super-normal powers and direct knowledge alone you may be lead to an improper understanding on an intellectual-only level."
5,A beautifully told story,"A touching story told very beautifully. It is a typical Shyam Benegal movie, that seems to have a soul.The story captures the horrors of India-Pakistan partition very subtlety and brings to light the plight of the divided families that still suffer in its bloody wake. The protagonist, Mammo, is played by Farida Jalal and she gives one of the most heart rendering performance here. The theme song of this movie sung by Jagjit Singh is very melodious."
1,"Amateurish, unintentionally hilarious","This DVD is so bad that it is almost funny. First, I haven't seen such bad sound sychronization since I watched dubbed Japanese monster movies in the '60's. Second, the DVD was made in the Winter, certainly not the most photgenic season for Cape Breton. Third, it evidently rained for eight days of the ten day shoot so a lot of the DVD talks about the rotten weather. Fourth, a good portion of the DVD is spent at a Canadian Legion Hall ""dance"" featuring a wretched heavy metal cover band. Fifth, a good 10 minutes of the DVD is devoted to Hopewell Rocks, New Brunswick, a beautiful spot, but totally unrelated to Cape Breton! This is obvious ""filler"" used to cover the fact that there is so little useful footage of Cape Breton.Please save your money, and don't buy this DVD! Any website devoted to Cape Breton will supply more information and more interesting pictures than this abyssmal DVD!"
1,"made me very dizzy, was not able to drive and go to work","I just tried vital Nutrients DGL Powder twice and was not able to sleep for two nights, I through away the container of vital Nutrients DGL Powder because I was not able to return this item"
3,Soothing,"Skimming through the book, although not very impressed, I did end up with a soothing feeling.SPECIFICS:Page Count: 128Number of images: 119Small images: 0Half page images: 24Full page images: 952-page spreads: 0BW images: 20TEXT:Foreword: 1 pageIntroduction: 1 pageAdvices for aspiring artists: 3 pagesIndex: 1 pageEach page has at least 1 short paragraph about the art there displayedART:2 images: 5 stars16 images: 4 stars90 images: 3 stars12 images: 2 stars0 images: 1 starOverall: 3 Stars"
2,It was a video getting people excited for something that had already happened.,This DVD isn't very interesting for fans of Serenity who have already seen the movie. This DVD was made for the long-time fans who had formed social connections around Firefly the TV show. Think of a DVD made about all of those fans who had made Star Trek into a motion picture and you might get an idea about this DVD. Worst of all this creation seems to have been about a month after the movie Serenity came out. There is almost nothing new in the package that is of worth if you already own the movie and TV show.
3,Good Documentry,Good reveiw of a fans journey from the axing of the series to the making of the film Serenity.
4,:-D,"It's really great, and arrived really fast. I'm just bummed that the interactive computer features don't work on my Intel-based Mac, but that's just extra stuff I hadn't expected in the first place. Plenty of special features besides it anyway. :D"
5,best vitamin C available,I take 2 packets every day for a year and have had no illness while taking it even though I am surrounded by sick people at work and on the bus going to work. The only bad thing is the price at $1.00 per packet its costing a lot of money but its worth it not to have any illnesses. It raises the vitamin C level in the blood much higher than any other vitamin C
2,Expired product date,"Although the product expiration date was only out dated by a couple of months and probably not harmful to the consumer, I would have appreciated knowing that information before I purchased the Lypo-Spheric Vitamin C. I will probably not purchase from this vendor in the future."
1,Lypo-Spheric Vitamin C,"Sorry, but twenty two packets of goo did nothing for me!Bought the book & records. Sounded good.I suggest you check out...Vitamin C diminishes Vitamin B"
5,Great,An older friend told me about these and gave me a sample. I use them if I feel a cold coming on and it knocks it right out . These are wonderful.. I believe my friend is 95 years old now ...I am thankful for her sharing.
3,Monotone Workouts,"I like Rodney Yee's am and pm yoga workout dvd, since I deemed the am yoga on that dvd a bit short, I opted to buy this one w/20 min sessions. They're quite monotone for ea session - one workout contains only standing poses, the other only twists, etc. I'd much rather have well-rounded complete sessions than just one type of poses for 20 min."
5,Amazing staple for your daily yoga routine,"I'll admit that when I first bought this DVD a few years ago, I wasn't completely thrilled with it. But since then it has become one of my favorite yoga DVDs. I keep coming back to it again and again. the work outs are the perfect length (about 20 minutes each) for a week day: strenuous enough to make you feel you've actually accomplished some real flexibility and stamina training, but short enough to allow for daily use. Add to that Rodney Yee's wonderful calm voice and serene visage, and you leave the work out feeling both tranquil and invigorated. I am not an advanced yoga practitioner, but I have been doing yoga for several years so don't consider myself a beginner. This DVD has continued to be enjoyable, beneficial and challenging even as my skills have progressed. I highly recommend it!"
1,Cheap plastic,This comb broke when I first used it. I was using it to comb out dandruff from my dog's fur. I had a similar comb by Ace but it was much sturdier than this one even though same design. This one wasn't worth the money. Wish I could find the better version.
2,Bad,"Very cheap quality... it got all broken after the first use. I would not recommend, and refuse to buy another one."
1,Whats wrong with you guys!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"You guys really need to get a life and stop making fun of all these artists! You're just jealous because carrie underwood is smarter, prettier, and a better artist then you'll ever be. Move on because look at how many copies your selling compared to her! Face it guys u lost. Oh and if I could give u 0 stars I would!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Close but no cigar.,"I have read all of this author's works and by far, Ben and Josie of ""Loose Lips"" and ""What We Did for Love"" fame are my absolute favorites. I just couldn't quite identify with Jazz. Something about this chick was a bit too strange for me. I loved the author's signature wit and humor as strong as ever in this book but still the storyline didn't quite jibe with me. Thomas, I thought, was totally cute and someone I could really get into but Jazz threw me with her weird and off-beat ways. One of the previous reveiwers pegged it, Jazz and Thomas make for a loony pair and don't quite pull it off as a couple. I'm still the biggest TMW fan and would read any of her work. Enjoyed the reading although not nearly as much as her other works."
5,A sad wonderful read.,"I have 3 children adopted from Korea and this book was a wonderful read that brought me to tears. I already had lots of information on adoption in Korea, but this offered me a greater insight on culture and the stigma surrounding a very complex situation. I applaud the bravery of the birthmothers. I cannot imagine the great sadness they must have giving up someone they loved for nine months and knowing they can never see that person again. This book allows you to feel what they are feeling. Thanks for a wonderful read."
5,Great delivery of product,"The album came and was in the condition promised. In fact, better than I thought it would be! I was very satisfied."
4,No Anxiety About Owning This,"Slatkin deserves kudos for being such a great interpreter of American composers. His time with the St. Louis Symphony has mostly been a blessing for those of us who are seeking recordings of great American music, but here he is with the BBC Symphony, and yet it is more proof of his abilities.The orchestra's playing is solid throughout, and I am completely satisfied with the soprano in the ""Jeremiah"" Symphony. The technical aspects are vivid, adding extra punch to Bernstein's reined-in bravado writing. As a bonus, the CD also includes the complete Divertimento for Orchestra, a fun piece to help lighten the mood after the far more serious symphonies. I don't think you can go wrong with this one."
1,no product recived,"it has been over three weeks and i still have't recived my cd. so i would have to rate this company very poor. i had sent a notice to the company and have not recived any response either. thank you, elena lowe"
5,A treasure of country music,"Erin Hay is one of the finest country singers of her generation, yet most fans of country music probably do not know about her. She will remind you of what you love about that kind of music. She has a perfect sense of the honky tonk sound, rich with twang and feeling. The instrumentation on her songs is terrific, too. This is roots music, updated perfectly.Erin Hay is a hall of fame candidate."
4,Relaxation with no hangover,The tea works like a dream. It relaxes me just enough to go to sleep and I don't wake up feeling drugged. Works much better than valerian capsules.
5,Sleepytime Extra really does the job,"Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime Extra with Valerian really helps get to sleep after a fast-paced day with work, kids, etc. The taste is not bad and the results are great! It can be hard to find in stores, so this is a good way to buy. My whole family drinks it now, so I was glad to find it in 6-packs."
2,Designed for A-Cup,They should recommend these for people with A cup. They are tiny. I buy silicone pads for more cleavage on occasions. These get lost under my C cups and does nothing. They are small and thin. They don't adhere to your skin either.
5,"Works well, can handle linux, great customer support","I accidentally killed mine with a bad linux install, which rendered the drive useless. Windows could not format it, nor could any other option. I contacted patriot, and within a day they had sent me a utility that restored the drive to perfect condition."
2,Bad Luck or Bad Quality?,"I purchased the 2GB one. I've tried a few times loading pictures to this drive. The most I could load was ~800MB. Is it just a defected drive I received, or it's in bad quality?"
3,Selected Poems and Prose by Adrienne Rich,"This book arrived in fairly good condition. A couple of pages were dogeared, but otherwise it was fine. As far as the text goes, it is very good, though quite obscure, poetry. You need a teacher to help you read it, and fortunately I have one. The footnotes were uneven."
1,Adrienne Poor,"She must be one of the favorite poets of English Lit. teachers, and one of the worst. Norton can do so much better with other poets and other authors. There are plenty of titles I would like to buy that Norton simply has ignored, and here we are with yet another edition of adrienne rich's poor talents and even poorer verse. What a waste."
1,book review,the book was a dissapointment not interesting at all would not recomend it sorry that it is taking up space in my kindal I thought that it would be about Van Gogh but it was about nothing that intrested me
1,Please!!! Quit singing through your nose!!,"Even in a select niche such as beach music, it is obvious how far nepotism can take someone. If Terri Gore's dad wasn't famous, she couldn't get the time of day from a record producer with this nasally, whiny sound. Her cover of ""Midnight At The Oasis"" should be a criminal offense. Save your money, and your ears, and buy the original. It may be 25 years old, but at least the scratches on a 45 would spare you the nasal twang of this CD. [...]"
4,Works as Advertised,"I probably should rate the external hard drive higher. However in my opinion when something works as advertised, it should receive an average rating. It worked immediately upon being plugged into my IEEE 1394 with my windows XP. The little software program they supplied set me up with the correct disc format and allowed me to partition the drive. I am using the supplied software to backup my system. The disk drive is very quiet, runs cool and the data transfer rate is very high as advertised. I feel good about my purchase."
5,"A bit noisy when not in use, but does the job very well","We got this 200GB drive to help us with the additional task of backing up files between offices when we realized that our Seagate 160GB drive would not be enough to do both things: daily backups and data transfer between locations. Now this 200GB monster is sitting in one of the offices for our daily backups and the 160 GB (also a Seagate) is going back and forth and they are both holding up extremely well.The two only downsides to the 200GB drive:-It can be a bit noisy (I find it noticeably noisier than its 160GB counterpart), including the times when it's not in use.-It is not precisely compact in design. But having seeing how many overheating issues arise in limited spaces such as the insides of laptops, I am not sure having a roomy case is such a bad thing after all.All in all, I'd recommend this external drive for daily backups any day. I am sticking with Seagate!"
1,Lasted only 2 months.,I plugged this hard drive into my computer and used it to backup files. About 2 months later I was copying files and all of a sudden it wasn't recognized anymore...I worked with it but nothing worked. I called Seagate Tech Support and they refused to honor the warranty because they wouldn't be able to tell if it was my fault that it broke...it never left my desk. Very poor drive.More recently i've purchased a Western Digital MyBook. I have dropped it 4 times and it keeps on trucking. The Seagate one is good if your in the market for a new paperweight.
2,Didn't work for me,"I bought this thinking I was going to get an upgrade to the 500. Unfortunately, though it was smaller, the ear piece was larger so I couldn't get the jabba gel over it. Without the gel, the ear piece just sat on the ear which made it unstable when moving.Also unlike the 500, this was quiet and difficult to hear or be heard. The 500 was loud with the jabba gel."
1,Going rogue...,"Just the thing for those who want to read the memoir of a lame child of a famous family who can only catch her little bit of limelight by shocking us with her departures from the conservative, Republicanism of her famous and heroic grandfather.So granddaughter of the savior of the West in WWII marries a commie and then, when she needs another splash of attention, quits the Republican Party and endorses Barak Obama.Just another spoiled brat of political privilege making her mark by selling out the side."
2,Like John Cusack but,My husband and I both like John Cusack but this movie just didn't do anything for us. Just don't think the plot was that good.
3,Affordable Improvement for Older Vehicles,"I bought these and installed them on my 2003 Jeep Wrangler. They're a solid improvement over the factory head lamps but lack the clarity I was expecting as a first-time buyer. Still, a satisfying purchase for the price point on Amazon."
5,Jeep headlights,These are cheaper alternatives to modern H4 plastic conversions with h4 bulbs and LED money is better spent on other upgrades.
5,Marvelous scientific biography,"I have ofter wondered about Dirac who I consider the mystery man of quantum physics. He seemed to be totally consumed my the underlying mathematics of physics, at the same time he was so naive about the trifles of human interchanges. This is a concise and illuminating history and I assume, the one that another recent book about Dirac is based. The book clears the clouds."
3,Good shoe for your style,"Make sure you like the style of this shoe. After three months of everyday normal wearing, the front part of shoe wearing out and it does not look very good any more. It is not for everyday wearing."
1,Piece of crap,"The webcam flops - you sit it upright, it falls over, biggest piece of electronic crap I've ever bought. The only cool thing was the surveillance software, however the pictures it took also crap."
3,you probably already have this,"The amazon person above got it right - not their best period, but hey - it's the Wedding Present so it's still pretty darn good. The problem is that if you bought Saturnalia and the MiniPlus EP when they came out, you already have most of the stuff on this CD except for some different versions and a few live songs. I admire WP's effort to keep their stuff available for fans but this is kind of overkill. Still one of the greatest bands of the 90s!"
1,Don't ruin the game,"Ico is a beautifully crafted puzzle game that lasts about 7-8 hours, with no replay value. The maps are not hard, and ""dying"" only happens if you make very careless errors. If you use this guide to run through the game, you'll only ruin the fun of the game, which is the puzzles. Relax. Take your time. Figure it out for yourself. Enjoy the visuals, they're some of the best on the PS2. If you really, really have to, consult an online guide."
3,"Great jersey, awful mask.","I had been wanting this costume for a while. The jersey, while not actually featured in Friday the 13th movies, is a must-have for any Jason Voorhees fanatic. I finally got around to ordering it and it didn't disappoint me. The jersey itself is worth the money you'll pay for this costume.The mask, on the other hand, is probably the worst quality piece of crud ever. When it arrived, it had been smashed to the point where the paint on the nose was chipping off. The mask is made of not-so-durable foam with not-so-lasting paint over it. Want my advice? Purchase this for the jersey, then find a quality mask elsewhere."
1,Horrible taste - better stuff available,"I have tried several different types of sugar-free chocolates and this is one of the worst. Instead, I recommend the Dove dark chocolate and the Russell Stover coconut."
3,Generic 1980's Dyfunctional Families,"There's nothing much new here. Several teenage boys have to deal with death, divorce, injury, and police. The performances were fine, but the script needed work. It's not enough to pile tragedy on top of tragedy. Note to all producers: I'm getting tired of every late 70's car being showroom clean and waxed and every 80's house having 3 lamps in every room."
5,Hollywood,"This is a excellent comedy and well put together. When looking at it. Just about every scene reminded me of something that happened to me in life. I normally don't look at the arts in this way. But, this movie just stuck out there in my face for real."
5,b-side the best song in years,"ok, i'm not gonna sit here and try to convince you that ""found a little baby"" is one of the best songs of the last decade. it just is. BUT i will tell you that i'm a musician whose records are sold here on amazon and i can tell you that i WISH i wrote and arranged ""found a little baby"". esp. arranged!! genius stuff.i don't think much of a lot of my ""contemporaries"" in the music world but liam hayes has got it. all the names thrown around are pretty close but jimmy webb(who is a god to me)is THE influence here.and yes, i was disappointed in the sparceness of ""more you becomes you"" but i still love that record too.BUY THIS RECORD AND IMPROVE YOUR LIFE!"
5,If You Only Knew,"At the time, I bought 2 of the Friendship Ring books, If You Only Knew and Please, Please, Please. The first one I read was If You Only Knew. I loved it!!! I couldn't put it down! I could not wait to start the next book! This is a wonderful book by a wonderful author."
1,The worst DLG album,"I bought ""Gotcha"" without first listening to it becuase I like ""Dark Latin Groove"" and ""Swing on"". I made a mistake."
3,"This product is okay, but I've seen better ones!","Although this product is all right, I have seen better. I will rather use the Twinkle Hair Trimmer; it works better1"
4,Great Product!,"Length:: 0:56 MinsGreat Product, if you're like me and need something to help trim body hair this is a pretty nice and handy tool. It's Cheap, easy to use. What else is there to say!?"
2,Aiptek Products,"We have purchase several and as long as you wish to take out door pictures and just download them, It is ok but if you want a WEB CAM.......... Don't purchase this product. It does not work and only sometimes can you get the programs to load. Very hard to do in Windows XP! Your computer will not reconize the camera!!! EVER!!! Tech support will not respond to you! You must call long distance to get any help! I will not purchase another AIPTEK product."
1,Cute piece of JUNK!,"I can't get the camera to work on my Windows XP. Batteries seem to be dieing within hours. Then tested batteries and they are fully charged, yet camera won't turn on. And there's NO OFF button! And it doesn't record SOUND! How can a web cam not have a mic? And who wants video without sound? And the Compact Flash card is NOT removable so you can't insert a larger (256MG) card if you wanted to. I've wasted 2 full days trying to get this camera to work on my PC with NO luck. Don't waste your time. It's not worth it. AipTek is JUNK! Back to Best Buy to return it..."
4,angels are watching over virtue,I was truly blessed by Virtue's songs. It was as if they just know exactly what people are going through and make the perfect song for that situation. I love them so much and I always tell people that I am the long lost member of the group because I can't stop singing like them. God bless!!!
2,Incomplete,"While the author obviously has done an enormous amount of research on the Prinsendam fire and subsequent sinking, he has totally ignored any and all statements and accounts of the Prinsendam's crew members. I am sure that there would have been many that would like to put the record straight after 25 years. The author is relying too much on press articles and passenger interviews while the official inquiry results of the Dutch Shipping Inspectorate are barely mentioned The book is also full of inaccuracies as to emergency operations on board a passenger ship.For those readers interested in the disaster and rescue efforts as seen through the eyes of the rescue organizations involved, this book will be very entertaining."
4,Good,This book gives you the knowledge to understand what happened when this boat sank. I was on the prior sailing and it is odd to read about the boat actually sinking following week.
2,Poorly researched and full of errors,"This book must have been written and reviewed by a travel editor. Any author with even minimal nautical experience would not have made the multitude of mistakes throughout the manuscript. Still, this author's mediocre effort can in no way diminish the epic rescue performed by the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Air Force and Canadian air crews off Sitka during October of 1980."
4,Great sub and customer service.,The sub I bought was defective but my brother has the same sub and it beats. 100 luxury is going to send me a new one while I send the defective one back. They have emailed me a lot and are taking care of me. I will recommend them to everyone just because they care about there customers. It a quality most company's do not have but they do. I can't wait to get my new one because I know for a fact that it is a good sub.
3,Pulsar Brown Strap watch,"Received this watch today and I am fairly pleased. The pros of this watch are firstly it is very thin and will fit comfortably under a long sleeve dress shirt, the aesthetics of the arabic numerals are quite nice, better than the Timex easy reader numerals IMO. The cons-the watch is not water resistant AND YOU CAN'T GET IT WET, and secondly if you have a very big wrist you'll be on the last notch. The strap is not very long at all and I don't have particularly large wrists. This is a very delicate watch meant for someone who works in an office, def. not someone pounding nails or laying bricks. I give it 3 stars out of 5, good buy for $50."
1,Brain Surgery is easier than figuring out how to use this adapter,My title says it all. One has the read the first review and following these steps exactly plus line-up the groves on the tape and adapter perfectly while slowly closing the case. Brain surgery is easier. My recommendation is to buy one of the more expensive motorized adapters. The few buck difference is not worth making a mistake and destroying your little girls first step.
4,Allowed me to watch old movies,This adapter was inexpensive and worked great so I could convert some old VHS-C tapes to my computer.
1,"please, do not buy this","Unfortunately, this converter jammed my VCR and ruined a family home movie...on the first tape. I had to take the VCR to be repaired...I'm not sure how much it will be to fix. I have used a converter for years and gave it to my nephew. I replaced it with this and have instant regret."
2,Simply a poor design,"Length:: 0:30 MinsI am sorry but a product should work as intended. $12 or $112.I have a brand new VCR as of this post and bought the Maxell adapter at the same time to copy VHS-C cassettes to DVD.1. The adapter will not go into the VCR smoothly - it is tight.2. Had to put it in part way eject it and put it in again to make it fit.3. Tried my old VCR and I had to disassemble it to get the Adapter back out.4. When I managed to get the adapter and copy a video I was not able to use the adapter to rewind.And finally some tapes were damaged.The problem is that the screws that hold the bottom plate of the adapter on are not flush with the bottom plate of the adapter and they rub on the VCR carriage when being inserted.This adapter may work on some machines but you will not know till you own it. Just sayin'. Remember, You can't go back and film your memories if you damage the tapes.My recommendation is spend the extra mony and get the automatic type."
1,TERRIBLE!! You get what you pay for!,"I tested this product out with two different VCRs (well, I tried to). In the first VCR it would not rewind or fast forward without getting the tape all tangled in the machine. It actually broke one of my tapes! It also would not play for more than 15 seconds without the VCR shutting off, a VCR we use for other things without any problems. In the second VCR, the adaptor was too big to fit into the VCR! Who makes a VHS adaptor that will not fit into a VCR. I returned this product and ordered the battery powered one from Ambico [...] and it worked perfectly in both. Spent a little more on that one, but you know what they say... you get what you pay for!"
4,great product for the price,"this isn't the easiest to use model, but for the price it is great. sometimes you have to slip the cassettes in just right or wiggle it a little as u insert your cassette into the adapter. but it it nice not to have to worry about batteries to replace. all things considered i am happy with the price and product."
1,Don't order unless your cassettes are Maxwell ones,"Do not order this Maxwell VHS C adapter if you are looking for a standard size adapter. It is not ""standard"" for all Cassettes. For example, JVC tapes will NOT fit in it. I know because I bougth one and damaged my cassette. You will be unable to slide the door shut &/or it will open up your cassette tape on top and damage it. Spend your money on one that is Standard instead of this. Only if you have a Maxwell cassette tape should you buy this. Otherwise, save your money."
1,RIP OFF,I CLEARLY TYPED IN THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AN ADAPTER THAT WILL PLAY 8MM CASSETTES AND WHEN I RECEIVED THE PRODUCT IT STATED THIS DOES NOT TAKE 8MM CASSETTES ..WHICH IT DOES NOT SAY THAT ON THE THE DISPLAY THATS POSTED....THAT WAS A RIP OFF FOR ME.
1,Pure Junk!!!,This is the worst product I've ever purchased. Shame on Maxell for making such a horrible product and marketing it to the unsuspecting public! Thanks to this piece of plastic junk I have lost a treasured video of an important part of my son's life that was captured almost 20 years ago. Don't buy into those who say if you are careful or do it a certain way it will work just fine. That's what I thought too but even following everyone's advice who left positive reviews my tape was ruined. I will never buy another Maxell product. If you value your VHSC tapes please spend the extra money and buy one of the old JVC Adapters. Now I know why they're so expensive. They're the only ones that are quality made. Too bad I lost mine. This thing is going in the trash. Lesson learned.
1,Wrong size,"It is NOT for 8mm cassettes :o( Very disattisfied with the product. My son plays sports and we need to convert the 8mm into videos, we try ordering this cassette because the description stated that fit 8mm cassetes and when we received it it too big."
1,Does not work with Hi8 cassettes,It says on the box that it does not work with 8mm cassettes. It does not say but it should mention that it also does not work with Hi8 cassettes.
1,just dont,This product did not function properly. Loading and unloading the device was nearly impossible because of the poor assembly. I would not purchase this product again.
1,NOT GOOD,"Somehow this device is folding the tape as it reads/plays it and ruins the tapes. I guess I should not have bought the ""cheap"" converter! Now I have to buy another one and spend more! UGH!"
1,Arrived broken,"The product was shipped on time, but it arrived broken and it will not work. I do not recommend it."
1,Maxell Cassette adapter,"This did not do what it was intended for and has been of no use to me. In short, a waste of my money."
3,"You get what you pay for, and these don't cost much","These replaced the shears that came with a Wahl electric trimmer set that I use to cut my husband's hair. They have a good heft in the hand and and the blades are nice and long, which I prefer. They're sharp, too. But I really can't call them any better than ""meh."" The action -- the actual feel of cutting -- just isn't that smooth. I've owned really high quality barber shears in the past, and this isn't what they feel like. The blades don't meet perfectly enough. They don't make that satisfying whispered metallic ""swish"" sound that perfectly honed blades make when they pass each other precisely. And, while they cut hair okay, they cut it just okay. The hair resists a little, but surrenders.Maybe I'm being too harsh. Browse Amazon or the web, and you'll see that really high quality barber shears go for hundreds of dollars. Pay 16 bucks, and you'll get 16 bucks worth of scissors. Which these are."
1,Not good.,"This was the worst dance DVD I have ever had. The moves are confusing and she does not explain them. Far from getting a good workout and feeling cool about dancing (as I usually do) I mostly just felt spastic. Like the other person said in her review, I thought it might get better with practice but mostly it was just frustrating. I'm returning this one."
2,Good for a LOT of weight-loss- not for long term results,"I got this book out of desperation as a mother of young children who didn't have time to go to the gym. I loved the in-home workout section. Changed my idea of a workout forever for the better! I lost weight, but since this book doesn't teach you how to eat correctly, it all came back plus some. I think if you have a lot of weight to lose, like 100+ lbs, Curves is a great place to start because you will drop pounds- just be aware that this book doesn't teach you about eating nutritionally for life... just eating a certain way for a few weeks to quickly lose weight.... but it will come back if you don't change your eating habits in a well-rounded nutritional way."
3,Curves (book) by Gary Heavin,This book explains the philosopy of the Curves exercise salons. It alsogives additional exercise methods and a diet program. The diet program is hard to understand because it onlyl gives shopping lists for weekly food amounts without suggesting daily menus.
2,Curves On The Go,This book is very helpful and it is a companion to the Curves Book(which I already have). This book makes it easy to follow your plan when you are on the go.
3,Recent events and trends tell us a lot about ourselves.,"Mostly short quips about news items which indicate that our society is doomed, or at least is several bricks shy of a load. The 101 puzzling statistics, interesting facts, and irrational actions are listed after a cutesy headline incorporating the word ""doom."" A quick and easy read which should appeal most to those over 20."
1,Mickey's Magical Christmad DVD,"The only reason this product received 1 star is because it arrived on time.Since the DVD came from out of the country we were unable to play it on ANY of our DVD players.""region does not support this drive"" was the error message received on all players.My Daughter was extremely disappointed as this was one of her few Christmas wishes.After reconfiguring our laptop we were able to play it one time on that. But when trying to re-play it only allowed us only 3 more down loads total before our harddrive would no longer work.This item was a waste of money and a huge dissapointment.You might reconcider having foreign DVD products for sale."
1,Ba! Humbug!,"All the classic Disney stars are here but only for a split second! Don't blink, you might miss Snow White even though she's featured on the cover. The animation is not up to Disney standards nor are the songs! Stick with ""Mickey's Christmas Carol""!"
5,Good value.,Different spin on same story. My daughter watched it several times while home sick. downloaded via kindle great value and easy download.
3,Just OK,"If your daughters are looking for lots of Disney Princess time on this show, they will be disappointed, just as we were (and considering the price!)"
2,Don&#65533;t waste your money!,"Absolutely disappointing!!! If you want to make a Christmas surprise for your little one forget this expensive DVD. Mickey Mouse and all his pals (old and new) are meeting at the House of Mouse and spending time on uninteresting conversations, unimpressive gags, and non-catchy songs. There are four cartoons interjected in Ricky Lake-like show. ""Donald Duck"" skating lesson and Mickey Mouse Christmas tree picking are classics and worthy of watching but they are only 5 minutes each. The only feature on this DVD my three-year old was salivating was the story of Scrooge with Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse and Goofy. But do you really want to spend over (dollar amount) for 25 minutes worth of cartoons? I grew up on Disney cartoons and I am initiating my daughter to Disney, but this is simply a rip-off!"
4,Hairdressers out from hiding . . .,"This revealing and sometimes amusing documentary follows the efforts of several western women to open a beauty school in Kabul, Afghanistan, in the days following the fall of the Taliban regime. Here the feminist assumptions of the school's instructors collide with the realities of life for women in a more traditional, male-dominated Islamic culture.The filmmakers have been invited into the homes of some of these women and we learn a great deal about their values and aspirations, as well as what is expected of them. When a young single woman reveals that she is ""in love"" with a young man, she makes the filmmaker promise not to tell her mother, who would strongly disapprove. A married woman speaks of living through the reign of Taliban terror that kept women house-bound, and another describes secretly working as a hairdresser during those years in her home - in defiance of the law. The beauty school instructors may make you cringe, but you'll admire their students."
3,The Beauty Academy of Kabul DVD,It is a short documentary on the beauty school. I was using it to supplement Deborah Rodriquez books of Kabul..The video did give insight on the female life in Kabul...but just not quite what I expected...I would recommend the DVD for those that want to see some of the conditions that they live in in Kabul though...
2,"NO WHEEL, HOW LAME","It's a pretty cool game, but not being able to use the wheel pretty much ruins it for me. If I had known that, I wouldn't have bought it."
4,A Solid Racing Title for the Wii,"Yes it will take you a while to get used to the controls, but once you do, it is a very fun game. There are many racing modes and the story is not half bad (for a racing game); it gives you an incentive to come back and play time after time. Tuning the car is easy and fun to do. There is a lot more depth here as compared to ""Excite Truck"", which is fun in its own, but not deep at all. Although all of the racing takes place during night time, the graphics is one of the best on the Wii. I recommend at least a rental for all racing fans out there."
4,Sunny strum-drum,"If you are at all familiar with the NZ strum-drum bands, then you know what to expect with Bike. Shimmery, multi-layered and extremely melodic. Andrew is not afraid to lay on the catchy melodies and he does so with a fervor worthy of Stealer's Wheel. His voice actually sounds like Gerry Raferty at times.While not completely different from the Straitjacket Fits, this is worthy enough to stand on its own. I would give it 4.5 stars if that was an option. Simply terrific and deceivingly catchy tunes."
1,There are better books on the subject,"Although the topic ""Endangered"" is timely and important, the book itself is poorly constructed and derivative. Each chapter consists of lengthy anecdotes and extensive quotations from other works, connected by the author's rambling commentary, with frequent references to his upbringing in an un-named Third World country. There is very little here that is original, and not much of practical help to parents. There is no question that our society is basically hostile to the needs of children. Researchers like David Elkind have been making the point for years. Readers would do better to turn to Elkind (try his classic ""The Hurried Child"" for starters) and similar authors for a clearer and more helpful analysis."
5,Two Thumbs Up,"I used this product to repair delamination on a Hobie Cat pontoon. It worked exactly as advertised, which is to say... very well. Supplier had excellent price and outstanding customer service. FedEx damaged my first shipment and supplier promptly sent another."
1,Not easy to clean,I didn't have any problems with this model bird house until it came time to clean out last years nesting. It was then that I figured out that you need to disassemble the bird house to clean it! Look for another model that has easily removable panels - not this one...
4,not bad at all !!,"I've put four of these together and have had minimal difficulty in the assembly. I guess the main item to remember is to make sure the peak cap retainers fit into the pole, and not just through the roof opening. To make sure the cap stays on during very strong winds, I put about 4 dabs of silicone sealer on the rim of the cap before pushing it down into place. The first one I put up has been there for six years, and is still in as good condition as it was when I put it up. Once assembled, it is rather stiff and consolidated. Only complaint is the problem of attaching the rails to the floor plate. Rail post must ""click"" into the designed holes or it will not stay. I have plans to add another set of apartments after this next season is over."
4,How the five powers stumbled into World War One.,"A nice read, and very fair minded especially concerning Germany and Austria-Hungary. Thonson details the principle authorities who were responsible for WWI and how their actions resulted in the world getting into this conflagration. The Germans and Austrians are of course detailed. Then there are the French and Russians whose action also caused the war. France did not want to be seen as causing the war, but her President Poincaire almost certainly raised the level and desire for war. As I have stated before, the Russians and French were not babes in the wood, and Thomson shows how their actions resulted in the conflict.This is a nice read. Unfortunately, this book is very much out of date and hard to find. It gives a balanced view of what happened in July and August of 1914."
3,Zombies - 'Collection' (Castle Music),"For the low price,this ten(10)track bargain title isn't half bad,but you might want to snatch yourself a copy of their 'Odessey And Oracle' or 'Begin Here' CD's(see my review of both).I mean,'Collection' does indeed have some nice tunes,like ""Tell Her No"",""She's Not There"",""Road Runner"" and ""I Got My Mojo Working"",but it's duration is just 28 minutes.By today's standards,that like an EP.Still,this CD would serve the completist a semi-worthy purpose."
2,OK Album The Zombies okay band,first off this is a very cheap pointless album and is just another one of the old greatest hits cds that sell for only 10 cents because people are dying to get rid of them because they just collect dust. the only really great songs on here are shes not there and time of the season but besides that the album is boring. All the songs are 3 minute little romance songs or tributes. Pointless not original
2,Another useless poker book,"I have bought them all, none would teach you anything you wouldn't learn at the tables and if you aren't are the tables there is no good for any poker book."
4,"Bluff me once, shame on you.","Great insight in to poker bluffing and reading bluffs. As with any other poker book you need to practice, practice, practice and find what works best for you."
2,Not again,"So here we have another series where a skinny model is able to whack around a bunch of guys much bigger than her. Come on. It's hard enough accepting the premise that every cop in the precinct--male or female--is drop-dead gorgeous, but that some chick weighing no more than a fistful of feathers can be sucker-punched by someone she has no reason to suspect, right out of the blue, and come back like Bruce Lee calls for way to much belief-suspension. I might give it a couple more views, but if the pilot is the best they can do, then I'll pass on the rest."
3,I like it. but,I wish they would take all of the crude sexual references out. I wish they did not ruin so many shows with this. It is like every one should be sleeping with random people all of the time. If you don't there is something wrong with you. Great message for all of the young people watching the show. The tension between theme is way more romantic then talk about hooking up all of the time. Of course they get this which is why the two have barely touched. It adds nothing to the show to have the side characters acting like one night stands are the keep to happiness. Which any person over the age of 25 should know and something that often takes major consequences for younger people to learn..
5,Classic love story,Romantic and knows how to develop the characters slowly. The love story building between Vincent and Catherineis classic! It is a series that will be watched over and over.
1,What the Heck?,"Okay people why would you want to play a game that is a T.V show. Come on, what could Raven possibley do, the fun thing might be looking through the future but still what the heck!!!"
1,So Stupid!!!!,"First of all, the Raven T.V. series stinks and so does the game. The graphics are AWFULL and the whole plot of the game is stupid. So follow my advice and DON'T GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!"
4,enjoyable,"If your looking for a fun golf game where you can customize and improve your in game character then this is the best of the best. Very relaxing and fun game, no complaints just wish the graphics were better. A lot cleaner than 08 version of the game."
