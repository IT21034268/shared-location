5,Attractive and practical,"Got two of these to use for clean and used safety glasses when clients walk back into our manufacturing areas. We added nice labels to the front of each basket. The baskets look good - not too ""country"" or ""homey"" and provide protection for the glasses be because of the cloth liner. They're a little narrower than what would be ideal for some of the pairs of safety glasses, but overall they meet our needs. Good product for the price."
1,Poor Quality Unit - ZERO Tech Support,"I bought this unit and noticed the low volume ""motorboat"" noise almost immediately. E-mailed tech suppport and was told to phone the tech support department to arrange for a replacement. Called the tech support department and was told to return it to the store where I bought it.Second unit was worse than the first and I'll be returning it for a refund tomorrow.Nice looking unit but with the mediocre quality and the non-existent tech support its pretty much worthless.Delphi refuses to aknowledge the problems that have been well documented in many other forums."
5,Stellar account of the postbellum delay of emancipation,"By first explaining the volatile atmosphere of the antebellum south and then giving gripping accounts of plantation life, the hellish life of 'free' blacks in the south, convict leasing, and prison farms (with abhorrent practices detailed up until the 1970s), Oshinsky provides one of the greatest accounts of American slavery I've read to date. An uncomfortable but excellent book"
2,Not My Cup of Tea.....,"I didn't particulary care for this album. There were no live instruments, and it sounded like some machine tampered with his voice. Everything was computerized, and on most of the songs, other than ""God Has Not Forgot,"" and a few others, if I didn't know any better, I would've thought that I was at a club. To be truthfully honest, I'm glad I listened to my sister's c.d. before I considered buying it. If I hadn't and would have bought it first....I would've really been disappointed."
5,BANGIN'!!!,"oh my God, he's done it again! In my opinion, Tonex is a musical genius. This guy is going to have longevity in the industry, not only because of his abundance of talent, but I really appreciate his stand for Christ, and his love for his wife. I guess I must have listened to Track 2, which is ""O2"", a billion times, I loved it so much. The whole CD is awesome, and I'm looking forward to more stuff from this guy. He is truly THE REAL!"
3,"great fun, looks and feels real, but doesnt last","awesome awesome toy! the only shame is that it doesnt last very long and that you can hear a buzzing noise when the thing is pressed down! i have had this for about 9 months now, and it quit out on me about 5 months ago with no warning!! beware of this toy! its fun if you dont plan to use it very much but i am disappointed!"
1,Rubbish Quality- Stay away from it,I wish I could give less than 1 star - the product is of very poor quality. It is made of cheap aluminum and not steel. My wife ordered it seeing the shiny picture in the product description. The product is not worth the money.
5,Love it.,My boyfriend and I have all sorts and brands of pans from over the years and have misplaced lids. This works well on all our pots. Thanks.
5,Perfect fit,"Got this for my Ruger GP100 4in. stainless, fit is snug and secure..Thumb snap is steel reinforced and easy to use, holds pistol very secure..Holster will break in in a few days and will last for years of hard use. It draws smooth after breakin period, I have Hi-vis front sights and there is no hang up. Thick leather, sturdy build just like my 22 year old one I use on my 44, very nice holster..I highly recommend it.."
4,"Lasts a long time, but dries out my hair!","I have used Bigen for years, but stopped because my hair was so dry from use. The last couple of years, I have used various rinses and dyes and they always fade after a few washes.My hair is black, but I use black brown. With bigen, you have to go a step lighter than the color you want.I like this product a lot because of its long lasting results and it is not messy. Unfortunately, I do have some on my forehead that I can't get off. I suggest you use vaseline on areas you don't want to be dyed by this product."
2,Black Relaxed Hair,I expected so much more from this because of its reviews. However im not impressed. My hair feels the same after using this.
1,Did absolutely nothing for my hair,"After hearing so many good things about Neutrogena Triple Moisture cream, I finally decided to try it. Well, suffice it to say I threw it out after a week.This moisturiser did nothing but fragrance my hair (it has a strong fragrance). I tried it as a leave-in, as well as a daily moisturiser. It probably worked better as a daily moisturiser, but it still didn't do much.After using this moisturiser, my hair felt coated and felt dry after a couple of hours. Not surprising, since two of the first few ingredients are silicones.I have used better moisturisers and leave-ins e.g. It's a 10, Skala.I will not be purchasing this ever again."
3,Needs English Dubbing,"The water margin was a good flick but despite the extra footage. I would rather have it dubbed in english, than have extra Footage. So I purchased Seven Blows of the Dragon."
3,Very thorough but way overpriced,"Who would have imagined 21 years after the initial release of Star Wars that the Force would still be with us. And box office receipts in the hundreds of millions generated by the 1997 re-release of the SW trilogy prove that interest in the series hasn't waned. This tells you everything you always wanted to know about Star Wars but were afraid to ask (or didn't know you should). Sansweet's Encyclopedia is an incredibly detailed A-Z listing of characters, creatures, gadgets, and gizmos gleaned from the films as well as the numerous novels and comic books they've spawned. It also offers a timeline for the entire SW story and an introduction by best-selling novelist Timothy Zahn."
3,Could be better - A good effort that fell short,"If you are a Star Wars fan this is a must have reference guide. However, the book is noy engaging. It could offer so much more. If you compare it to the Star Trek Encylcopedia you would see a difference in presentation. Star Wars should have an entry like ""planets"" then list every possible planet worth (and not worth) mentioning along with brief info in a chart form. The the same should have been done with ship names. There could have been more picture layouts for ships, showing the different types and scale, and types of uniforms, symbols, insignias, and weapons. I hope the CD version offers more."
5,The definitive guide to the Star Wars univers,"I have been a Star Wars fan long enough to have purchased previous all inclusive reference books to the star wars universe. This one blows them all away. First of all, since the resurgence of popularity of Star Wars mountains of material about the galaxy far, far away has been in circulation. New characters, worlds, and species have been created through comics and novels, not to mention the roleplaying game. The Star Wars Encyclopedia has cleanly laid it all down for Sci-fi posterity. This volume contains information to challenge and enhance the knowledge of any Star Wars fan. It is well worth a read. May The Force Be With You."
5,Solid and Accurate,"Have you ever wanted to know where the Glythe Sector is? Or wondered what a M3-D2 droid was for? If you have then I highly recommend the Star Wars Encyclopedia by Stephen J. Sansweet, because it is filled with all things Star Wars-from movies, novels, comics and TV shows, (Though I suspect I would have been happier if it had no mention of the Ewoks/Droids cartoons). This is a high-quality publications and is presented hard cover format, making it an ideal addition to anyone's Star Wars library. It allows the reader to see what wonderful consistency that has been built up over the past 22 years within the universe-something that Star Trek can never boast about given how everything in that universe is entirely variable. Clear, easy to read entries are laid out naturally in alphabetical format for easy location, and it would make an a great tool for role players as well, making it is easy to find characters, places, vehicles, etc."
3,"Not bad, except for the cover.","All I have to say is, I love Star Wars, it's a great book, but who was sleeping in the editing room when the art for the dust jacket went to print? Perhaps the Michaelis/Carpelis Design Assoc. Inc. company and Brian Dugan failed to reference any of the three movies in the trilogy, or they would've known that Luke Skywalker has NEVER weilded a RED light-saber! Nor has Darth Vader ever battled with a BLUE one! That alone took out a lot of faith in the book. After perusing it for a short while, I do agree it's interesting and in-depth, but in this case, you CAN judge a book by it's cover; especially if it's a book about Star Wars."
5,Everything about Star Wars is in this book,"An Excellent book, this is the first book like this I've bought and it certainly won't be the last. It is well worth the money I paid"
4,Contents is Great...,"In Depth, interesting and accurate as the other reviews say but a shame about the foolish mistake on the front cover. Every Star Wars fan knows what color light sabers Luke and Darth should have, but they still got it wrong. I suppose it doesn't matter really but still..."
2,Are you sure your printer is supported?,"This server worked great to connect older laser printers. No additional workstation software is needed. I had an old HP1020 work horse and this server did a great job for simple one sided printing. In this simple situation- this is a great print server.Two way communication needed for an HP ink jet, HP laser jet and Epson ink jet won't work and complex printing won't work.Before you buy this be 100% sure your printer is supported and the type of printing you do will work."
2,Poor Technical Support,"It does not work with my HP Deskjet printer, the tech support were completely unhelpful, and just told me to read the manual and follow the instructions, they wouldn't help me troubleshoot the installation.The print server seems like a good product, but the technical support is awful."
1,What a piece of sh....,"I cannot begin to tell you how poor the product support is for this piece of junk. It will NOT work with an OfficeJet of any kind - forget even trying to set up the printer as a multi-function device. I couldn't even get it to recognize the printer via USB cable.No tech support to speak of, and the manual is pure garbage. Returning tomorrow to try a real brand.DO NOT BUY THIS P.O.S."
2,Research specs on your printer before purchasing,"Had to send this print server back because it would not work with my printer. The description and specs listed did not specify that it would not work on a ""Host Based"" printer, even though the printer has usb."
1,do not buy,"You will be sorry if you purchase from these guys. They have an abysmal customer support record and a laughable sense of proper documentation. ""Is my printer compatible?"" ""I don't know, you would have to call pre-sales""So I just keep checking with pre-sales until I find a printer that works? You're kidding, right?"
1,doesn't work with hp 1005,"Ordered this to free up a computer in a room only being used as a print server so that the kids would be able to use it, and the idea of this is exactly what I need. However, it always says the printer is offline. It does see it, but this is some sort of unidirectional box and almost all printers now are bi-directional, meaning they take in print commands, and send back info to the computer (like toner/ink status, and whether it is off or online. Since the box doesn't see the printer is online, it is useless. Tried for an hour before discovering why the printer would install but not print. Sent it back the next day. Don't waste your time or money. Is there a no stars option? This looks like someone made a usb version of a relic that should have died shortly after dot-matrix printers."
1,glad it was free,"My co-worker gave one to me because she couldn't get to work after a whole lot of fussing with it. After two days of playing with it and I don't have two hours to spend with tech support, I'll be giving to some poor unfortunate soul."
2,Pretty difficult,"I have mild to moderate experience with networking, but can usually figure it out or know to call someone who knows. But this thing is pretty rough on me. So far I have invested approx 1.5 hours of my time with nothing to show as of yet. So far I have not found a listing of compatible printers. But for now I have to give it low ratings. I may end up throwing in the towel on this one and sell it."
1,Pointless,"I looked for a vacuum cleaner on Amazon, which lead me to a site in the U.S.A.. I ordered the cleaner, but when it arrived I realised that it was 120 volt and I cannot use it in the U.K.. Despite complaining on numerous occasions I am still left with a vacuum cleaner that I cannot use and which they have charged me for."
5,A strategic focus combined with a clear introduction,"The real value of this book to architects is its pragmatic presentation of enterprise integration strategies for service oriented architectures. The author detials a range of implementation scenarios, pifalls and best practises according to the IT maturity of the enterprise.The book presents a complex topic in a sufficiently organized and clear fashion to make it suitable as a starting point for enterprise clients to understand the language, strategic opportunity and challenges of Service Oriented Architectures.This book is a must have for architects and technology consultants involved in implementing service oriented architectues."
2,Waste of verbatim,"The entire book can be summed up on 3 to 4 pages. Mostly the book regurgitates the same concepts over and over to fill up the pages, using a plethora of technical terminology to abstract it's own meaningless. For the most part the book is intended to give you an overview of verity of technologies encapsulated in SOA architecture, but from a very distant perspective."
5,SOA Design Fundementals in multiple levels,"It's a practical guide on defining service characteristics and design principles in multiple levels, from component implementation to application design to enterprise architecture. Very digestive material."
2,Not the best,"First off, if you have a PSP Slim (PSP 2000 series), it will not fit right. It will hang on and you'll have to secure it with something like tape. The speakers have two hooks that fit into the screw holes at the top of the PSP and another two hooks that hold onto the bottom of the PSP. The audio is louder by far and easier to hear in a noisy environment, but the audio quality is not as crisp as the built in speakers. Lastly, the speakers require their own power source, so get two AAA batteries ready. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Having it's own power source does free up more play time on your PSP.Personally, if you have a slim, don't bother buying this. If you have a regular classic PSP...well...I'd just recommend finding a better quality speaker to use."
4,short and has been reissued with 2 Franck pieces,"Telarc CD 80637 adds Cesar Franck pieces ""Fantasie in A"" and ""Pastorale, Op 19"" making the total time of the reissue 61:39. 2004"
3,"hall sound, what hall sound?","Just a note for audiophiles - this early recording is one of those where the organ is in stereo, but the reverb/overhang is in mono. There might have been coincident mikes to explain this - there is left and right organ sound, but virtually no space. You either like this technique or you don't, but if you don't it is really annoying, especially compared to live organ.Still, your mightiest subwoofer, a true one, not the so-called subs that are really just woofers, will have a lot of fun with it. A true sub has, for a change, a lot to work with.JK"
1,Not the same sound.,"I love the sweet voice and easy falsetto of the early Muldaur. After one listening, I gave this album away."
4,Good resource,"This book covers the basics of CAGD. It starts with a brief overview of vectors and some of the mathematics that are essential to understanding the rest of the book, then plunges into the material. The book does a really good job of describing the algorithms from different perspectives. The major algorithms are approached in two ways, one from the way average people could understand how the method of creating curves works, the other from the way the computer generates the curve, mathematically.The math in the book is not for the beginner. It does require a good exposure to linear algebra and some calculus to understand. There are many examples of calculations to follow along if you have trouble.The basic concepts of how to create curves using the methods described, anyone could understand.This book is a really good reference and a pretty good introduction to many of the CAGD concepts. There are a number of errors in the book, but most of them are easy to spot."
4,GORGEOUS...BUT COMPLETELY BOTCHED ENDING,"Simply wonderful rendering: perfect cast, lovely score, beautiful undercut direction. The only warning I have is to turn off the DVD near the end, when Carrie and her brother are leaving Wales. Thereafter is botched and incongruent. If you're going to use a certain convention, one must do it in the first ten minutes of a story - not introduce it at the ending, where it clumsily destroys all the lovely moments preceding it. Nonetheless, a terrificly enjoyable 90 minutes."
1,Rasputin,Rasputin is nothing more than an adults only production made specificaly for the Adult Film Circuit.Its transfer from film to video and then onto DVD has resulted in a sub-standard end product of no historical accuracy.The picture quality is poor and does not hold ones attention for very long.I think that other versions of the story are superior to this one.I can always say that I saw it once.David Cox
3,Needs to be bigger,The case is good. I got it free when I bought a game. My only complaint with it is that there needs to be space for the adapter for it to be really useful.
5,Wonderful stuff,"Been using this product for many many years. For cuts, burns, dry skin and is the best diaper rash cream out there. It might say for animals but it is great on humans too"
4,"Felt a little clunky, but a good game nonetheless","I played this game on the PS2 and loved it and have since bought the PC version since it was so cheap. It somehow feels a bit more clunky on my PC (and it's not a question of hardware as this machine can run Oblivion at 1680x1050 with all graphic options at max). Still though, it's a great game with a cool storyline, and a must for any Warhammer 40K fan. My only regret...close combat as a Fire Warrior just isn't something anyone wants to get into. Also would've been better to be able to play as a Space Marine, but some would claim that would be a little too easy in certain regards."
4,Good Blues,I listen to an internet blues station and I think I heard a few of Juniors tunes. I mainly bought this disc to hear the blues from an SACD source.I like the surround mix as well as the 2 channel. They did not go overboard on the rear channels like some discs. Since its Hybrid I can take it with me in the car. I nerver heard Junior's version of Gimme one Reason. I was familar with Tracy Chapmans I like them both. Its a good listen and make a great addition to any blues library.
5,A Real Gem!,"This record is real blues, great harp playing, singing, slide playimg! It doesn't get better than that!"
5,Inspiring,"Like others, I first heard this 20+ years ago on a Telarc vinyl disc (which I still have). If your turntable and cartridge were not up to par, the thump of the drum would actually skip the needle out of the groove, and if you looked with a magnifier you could see the bass in the impression.The engineering of the recording was so top rate it still stands out today on CD. The caliber of the performance is outstanding. If you don't like at least some of this album, I'll eat a bug."
3,"Fun, but wheels slip","Bought this for my daughter Just turned 4. It looks so great, but was a let down when she tried to ride it, the wheels do not have enough traction and slip, so it is very frustrating to ride. Before long, she was pushing her dolls on it instead of riding it herself. This will go back to toys-r-us"
3,Amazing price for a cheap toy,"Besides the fact that I got an amazing deal from amazon (25 w/ shipping compared to 40 in store) The toy is not a good quality. The stickers dont stick very well( half came off) and the toy is plastic and it shows. Its not very steady. Your 2 yr old will not be able to reach the pedals, no matter how tall they are, but my 5 yr old can drive it with ease. The buttons are cool and educational. If you are looking for a trike to last a long time then this is not the trike for you, but If you child loves dora and wants a trike go for it."
1,little book in a big package,"This book may be a good read however, despite the size of the book it is offset by the small font(8), much to small to easily read. The print occupies only a 1/3 of the page. What was the publisher thinking? Needless to say I had to return it unread."
3,1996,"I'm looking for a good reference book, for my PE exam. I bought this, kind of at Random. When I got it I was very dissapointed to see that it was written in 1996... This was written a year after I graduated from high school... Simiconductor devices have changed so much sense then... I hope it is a good book, but I wish I would have got a more recent book."
4,Enchanted Robert and Gisel Barbie Dolls,My daughter loves the movie Enchanted. These dolls look a lotLike the real characters. Nice quality barbies.
3,Lackluster Performance,"The CD of this performance did nothing for me, so the added dimension of watching this show does makes this set palatable, I guess. It's kinda interesting to watch. I just can't get excited about it because Dylan and the band don't seem too excited about it. The energy level does start to pick up in the end somewhat, I think. But there's a feeling of ""going through the motions"" here that is unfortunate. And the set list leaves a lot to be desired. John Brown and God on Our Side are interesting, I guess. Dignity's kinda fun because it's not on an album, I guess. Oh yawn, think I'll take a nap."
4,works well but replacement problem,"This product does work well in removing fingerprints and preventing skips but it recommends replacing the cleaning pad after 30 cleanings, or sooner if the pad looks dirty. It also gives intructions on how to replace it. It states that replacement pads and cleaning fluid refills are available from your dealer. This I have found to be untrue since I have not been able to find the pads or fluid anywhere."
2,Sacrificed utility for looks...,"Works great, if you can make it work. The main problem is the design of the handle, if you can call it that. There is so little area to hang onto with your thumb and finger to turn the wheel. Easy enough when there is no load, but once you have a wet disc loaded... take out the pliers! They should have designed it with a better handle. If you have to go through several hundred DVDs at a time like I do, it's pure torture."
3,Nothing special,"I used a Birnbaum Disney guide many years ago and liked it. So I ignored some of the negative reviews and bought this book. I figured it would have additional useful information on restaurants that the comprehensive Disney guides would not have. I was wrong. I also bought The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 2005 (great book!) and found its one chapter on Disney restaurants had all the information I needed. I didn't use the Birnbaum guide.The food at Disney restaurants is great. If you don't have a comprehensive Disney guide and all you are interested in is the restaurants, then you will like this guide just fine."
5,Healing power of the mind,"The author shares the spiritual laws of healing and deals with the causes of emotional and physical problems. She shows one how to turn on the corrective thoughts in order to change the whole pattern of your life for the better. It is explained that everybody can use these ancient healing laws and there's nothing mysterious about them.In fact, healing constantly takes place in our lives in simple ways that seem miraculous. We all have the healing power, if we only realize it. The healing laws include: The ""No"" law, ""Surprise"" law, Law of Release, the ""Yes"" law, Praise law, Law of love, Miracle law, Occult law, Imaging law & the Mystical law.Countless examples of healing are provided to demonstrate these laws in action. A pleasure to read and a book that substantially expands one's consciousness. Should be on every healer' bookshelf.How to Use Your Healing PowerYou Can Heal Your Life (Gift Edition)"
2,"Good content, very poor execution","This book would be a fine introduction to semiconductor processing if it were not so poorly written. The scope and depth of the material is appropriate and informative. However, the book was published without sufficient editing or, apparently, any proofreading and the result is occasionally inaccurate, often grammatically incorrect, and comically redundant throughout (the author must have been paid by the page). Find a more carefully written guide or wait for the fifth edition and hope it doesn't slip past the editor like this one did."
2,Stopped reading it,"I was really excited to read this book from all the great reviews I had read but did not enjoy it. I guess what I didn't like was his writing style which I found a bit stuffy and formal and the stories he talked about weren't really all that interesting. I got half way through and thought, ""Forget it"" and put it away, not likely to go back."
2,Really dirty/wrinkled/TAPED together book.,"This book said ""good."" not, ""taped together with wrinkled pages and dirty outside cover"" Not very happy with this purchase!!"
4,Regular Guys Indeed,You'll like this story line. I've known a few straight and gay guys with this type of friendship. Very enjoyable performances and most real story line.
3,"Worth seeing, when all these movies seem alike.","Well, all these movies seem to be alike when it comes to the story line. But this ones woth seeing."
4,funny and light worth it for the rental,"I enjoyed this film! That being said, I like to watch movies from Germany! I think it was a great story! felt like there where some spots that needed more info but all in all fun!"
5,Regular Guys,"Divest yourself of the proclivity to be too critical, judgmental and officious and just sit back, relax and enjoy this rather charming and humorous flik. It's premise is simple, the situations are familiar (to me, at least) and the underlying development of the relationship between the main characters is almost too sweet, and, yet, enviable. Would that life were like that and that real caring among people was that easy. Hey, guys, I am a 72 year old gay guy, no lover at present (mine passed away 14 years ago)and I was touched by this relaxed, fun film--So, Shoot me! Then, go watch it and see if you're able to experience it and NOT smile at the end. Just do it! Don't take life so seriously for once. Luv to each of ya! Valentino427"
3,OK,"The aerobic portion of this video was very fast pase and hard to follow. But, the arms and abs portion was effective."
5,It took me by surprise,"I was so excited my I got my Dark Angel Soundtrack cd I couldn't wait to listen to it, but at the same time I was hoping I won't be skipping through alot of the songs. When I played the CD, it took me by surprise...The Dark Angel Theme with Chuck D and MC Lyte, dang...That song is the bomb!!! It made me hype up about the show and the fact that it is a great song. And another song called ""The One"", those two songs really tells all about what ""Dark Angel"" is all about. This really is a great CD for a great show. I just hope ""Dark Angel"" will be around for a while, so we can keep talking about how great the show and the soundtrack are."
2,Disappointing!,"As an intuitive person and one who is always interested in what makes people tick, I was excited about this book because it circumvents the difficulty of written language. The test was fun enough, however, the deeper I got into the book, the more I sensed that it was just off on the details--for both me, my spouse, and my family members who took it with me. I found a much more succinct and accurate quiz on ColorQuiz.com. Save your money."
1,"very disappointing, returned it","First of all this is a cheap childs toy and will not fit even the smallest adult, which isn't very clearin the ad. Secondly it looks nothing like the photo and is totally ugly and just poor beige lumps.the gun was a completely different color than shown..it was white. The box it came in was also mashed.i returned it as soon as i saw how awful it was, which was a total pain."
3,Nice addition for the Padme Amidala costume,"We bought this for our 7 year old daughter to go along with the Padme Amidala costume we got her for Halloween. In my mind it's exactly what I've come to expect from costumes and accessories.The gun has held up through much play so far. The only issue is the trigger can be a bit flaky at times. It takes 2 AA batteries. Our daughter liked the fact that it makes sounds just like Padme's blaster.The belt is made from a single piece of molded plastic. The holster looks like the pictures, but the pouches look more like ""blobs"" of plastic (for lack of a better description) as opposed to actual pouches. Our daughter didn't care in the least!The belt attaches with velcro, but we had to use a safety pin to attach it on our skinny 7 year old - no big deal...room for growth!After buying several costumes of the years, we've come to NOT expect too much from them, but this has been fine and we would buy it again."
1,GARBAGE,This is the sleeziest and poorly produced film I have ever seen. It is vulgar and done in very poor taste. Only the scum of the world find any entertainment in ths dvd.
1,Fell in love...,"Fell in love with this dress, but after reading the review I changed my mind. I will probably never order from this store. It's too bad, they should have made the customer happy, since we who shop online all the time do read the reviews....Hope you are listening"
2,not satisfactory,We tried using these latches on various drawers and doors. They never worked well. Our two-year old found she could still get by them if she opened them quickly. They don't seem to grab well and are very difficult to install.
3,Well built but not very sturdy,"I was planning a trip to Europe and thought this monopod support might be a good option that would allow me to leave my tripod behind. I have a Manfrotto carbon fiber monopod, so I hoped to travel very light. I envisioned leaning the monopod with pictured support bracket against a hand rail, or perhaps a wall to steady my camera. Although very well constructed, as is the case with most Manfrotto products, I was disappointed that this product really isn't capable of supporting anything but the smallest of cameras. It simply wouldn't support my digital SLR with lens attached. The ball head is very small and not capable of supporting much weight. I think this product would work very well with a smaller camera, like the Canon G11 that I also own, but is inadequate for larger cameras. I returned this product and took my tripod along on my trip."
5,"Easy to use, and doesn't take up space on power strip","I hate power supplies that plug directly into the outlet. Usually, they're really bulky and end up covering the adjacent outlets, rendering the power strip ineffective. Fortunately, this POE injector plays nice, and has a power cord."
1,My wall in Charger was EUROPEAN Standard?!,"First of all. I purchased this product to be used in the USA. 2nd of all, there is no way to contact the seller to tell him that. 3rd of all. The product is useless because I have to go to Europe now to use it. BUYER BEWARE"
3,Oliver Stone's first film - psychological trama.,"Edmond Blackstone (Jonathan Frid) is an author of horror stories who suffers from a recurring nightmare in which he and his family are terrorized by three bizarre figures. Just as Blackstone starts to write, the three figures appear at this home, and the dream becomes reality. One of those figures is played by the late Herve Villechaize (Fantasy Island) and he is VERY convincing and scary as hell! I would love to see this movie remade!"
4,love it except,the tuner on this unit is amazing... the only downside would be the fact it does not like to play burnt or backed up dvd movies.
1,Akward to Strap on Head,This was a disappointing santa present. One of the bulbs did not work. The stapping and battery are combersome to a four year old's head. This is an item I will be donating to the Christmas toy fund during holiday clean out. They have laid around the house all year--untouched.
1,Mis-named and misleading,"This was a very disappointing toy. As my two daughters said, ""What's the point?"" It's like wearing two flashlights on your head and the goggles are not at all comfortable. A regular flashlight would be a better bet."
3,Disappointed to say the least...,"To say that I am disappointed by this latest release from the DC10 series is an understatement. Last years release mixed by Cirillo & Tania Vulcano was EPIC. It is still the best Album that I own. To this day!!!Perhaps I haven't given this compilation a good enough try but it is way too experimental and downtempo for me. I have been to Ibiza and this is not really what DC10 is all about.I disagree with the last reviewer that this is sleazy, sexy, pumping music. It's way to chill for my tastes. Hopefully, it will grow on me over time.I definatly recommend picking up the 2004 DC10 (mentioned earlier.) It's well worth the money."
5,Excellent,"This DVD is a must have in your Drummer's toolkit. Very good layout of skills and well explained, demonstrated and applied.I highly recommend it."
5,"After a 30 year hiatus, great tool for relearning","I played for about 5 years, 30 years ago. While I tapped my feet and hands during those 30 years, I forget a lot of technique. This DVD helped me to get back a lot of what I'd forgotten. And it is opening my eyes to stuff I'd never ventured into. It is a great, comprehensive look at a lot of different types of grooves.I suggest putting the poster up somewhere that you can see it easily while playing. Seeing Igoe perform is a great help, but for slowing it way down and getting the coordination working, the poster is indispensable.Getting the old grooves back and learning some new ones will make me a much better drummer than I was 30 years ago. I will be getting Groove Essentials 2.0 when I get 1.0 down."
4,The first album is not bad,"The album was never origianlly released in the U.S. The only difference from the original release is that the title track was available twice on the vinyl. First track in swedish, last track in english. Even though a bit silly some times, it is excellent commercial 70's music. But for somebody starting to listen to ABBA I would start with a later CD like ""Super Trouper"" or ""Arrival"". With this as their first album together, it is worth the money."
3,indifferent,"Having completely disregarding the previous reviews, I went ahead and bought this game. It's not made as terrible as those claim to be, and the only way I can see spiderman falling off is if you're pulling really hard on it. The game is made ok, the card board slots do tend to come out of the board more often than not. But it's not that big of a deal. The game is slow, and not that much fun. I bought it for my 3 and 5 year old sons for Christmas, thinking that at least one of them would like it, but that's not really the case. We've played it just a few times since then. It's kind of a boring game with going around the board an endless amount of time until all the villains are captured. I am a big believer in making my boys finish things that they start, but I have let them give up this game because there's not point to it. It's still kind of cool to have in our collection of games though."
5,brings memories,Dr. Gottleib's book so very well describes growing up in the late 20s and 30s in an immigrant Detroit neighborhood that so much resembled scrambling up in New York City. There is humor and great honesty in the telling of this man's story of becoming a complete man... a mensch. I read it in two days and wish it was longer.
5,This Is the Country Album Of The Year,"In My Opinion This Is The Best Sawyer Brown Album To Date,It Has Great Songs.The Best Are The Following-IN NEED OF A GIRLFRIENDCOME BACK BABYSOMEONECAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?definitly buy this album."
5,Classic EWF,EWF are still the baddest Band to Me&when they were on there 70's roll they truly brought the Pain with each Album&Tour.this Song is timeless.Happy go lucky&full of fun.all the classic EWF Arrangements&production in full effect here.
2,Something to keep in mind while reading this book,"exegesis (n) an explanation or critical interpretation of a text.eisegesis (n) the interpretation of a text (as of the Bible) by reading into it one's own ideas.If you already hold the opinion that the Bible says homosexuality is a sin, abomination, etc. this book will appeal to you and solidify your opinion.If you want to find out what the Bible says, look elsewhere."
3,A mixed bag,"While Gagnon's caliber as a researcher is unimpeachable, his skill as a theologian is considerably more questionable. Conservative Christians who take a close look at his underlying arguments will no doubt be concerned by his views on the authorship of the Bible, his overextended argument from design, his apparent rejection of the doctrine of eternal security, and his downplaying of Jesus' condemnation of divorce.Readers of all persuasion will be concerned by the circular logic Gagnon employs when fitting a number of passages (Judges 19, Ezek. 16:48-50 and Gen. 1:26, among others) into his condemnation of homosexual activity. Discerning readers will be even more concerned by his extensive reliance on Paul Cameron's thoroughly discredited sociological research.Although I agree that the Bible reserves sexual activity exclusively for heterosexual marriage, Gagnon's book will be, at best, a secondary resource in my library."
5,Excellent in-depth study!,"Gagnon has produced the type of book this topic deserves. So much is written about this topic that is biased by an a priori positive or negative attitude towards homosexuality, that it is refreshing to see a really thorough study of the topic at hand. Gagnon is clear about his opinions, no doubt about that, but these are well separated from his exposition of the texts. It is the well-balanced nature of his arguments, the thoroughness of the exegesis and the completeness of his discussion that have set the standards of discussing ""What does the Bible say about homosexuality?""."
2,A little book about nothing,"This book is poorly printed. It is done on the inexpensive side with very cheap paper. Thus, when you try to really open the book you break the spine.The printing is very close together and very difficult to read.The information is crowded together. Not a book for the Hungry Traveler."
3,"I love it, but it will not stay together!","I am very disappointed because normally Playmobil quality cannot be beat! The attic especially is very tricky to assemble, and the construction is very fragile. The attic falls apart on a regular basis. It is also very easy to shift the house from the base. I even tried adding some drops of glue to hold it together, but it didn't last either. I am going to try to use a couple drops of Super Glue in various point to see if it will stay together then. My kids love it, but they are extremely frustrated when it comes apart, and it has been nothing but a headache for me and my husband who are having to reassemble it constantly, which is not quick or easy."
4,"It is worth the buy, a must to add to all the steel tapes!!","I just did this workout(the aerobics part), and I really thought it was fun and not to difficult at all, I got all the moves by the first or second try and I didn't even view the tape first, each instructor has a new routine and they take you step by step building up to all the moves. Don't be afraid to try this fun tape, the bad reveiws I read kept me from completing my total steel collection, I finally grew so curious, as to why this tape was so bad and I just loved and enjoyed doing the rest of them, I just bought it and took a chance, I'm super glad I did. This tape is a great workout!! Try it!!!!"
4,"Terrific, motivating aerobics section!","I just recently purchased this one and have really enjoyed working out to it. I look forward to the ""jazzier"" aerobic segments and portions of the toning (Leisa's floor work in particular). This is a good one to get for a good fat-burning, energizing work out."
4,Delicious,These are not hot even though they day Jalapeno. We cannot even taste any Jalapeno. But they are soft & delicious. Now they are our favorite cornbread. To bad they are not Organic.
2,"Great story, but.......","I just finished this book and I am so mad about the ending! If not for the way the author chose to end it, I would have given this story 5 stars. I liked the characters, and I had a hard time putting it down. It was one of the most gripping medical thrillers I have ever read. However, I absolutely hated the ending. I could not wait to find out what happens to the clinic, and what happens to Laura's baby but I was totally let down. The reason is: the author chooses not to tell you the answers. The book just ends. If you like to be left hanging, then you'll love this book, if you don't, then don't bother reading this one!"
5,"And, still in fantastic sound!","I like the way ""RumCow"" says it's still the same old 1985 sound even though Amazon lists it as being issued in 2002. Apparently, from what I've noticed after reading Amazon's stats on CD's for a long time this apparently must mean that it was reissued in 2002, but is still the same recording it was for sound and performance from when it was first in print back in '85. Well, this Bipolar Bear rates for both Sound and Performance in my database for CD's where I rate things on a scale of from 0 - 11, 11 being Superb, can't find anything to complain about at all. Well, I rated this an 11 when I first got it in '85 and, even by today's standards in digital recording it still deserves an 11 for both Sound and Performance. So, don't hesitate. If you want a Rachmaninov Second by all means get this recording. It's still one of the best out there, and now at a reduced price!Mark Zimmerman, Chicago - the Bipolar Bear"
4,Interesting Story,"This is an interesting story, one with twists and turns that are unexpected. Overall the story comes across without distractions - it is a well told story with good acting, filming and directing."
3,Not Telarcs' best !,"I should have listened to C.Tate who gave this recording the most accurate review that is available. The performance is marred by a bad engineering/ recording! This is truly a crime,as the performance was, as far as I could tell beautiful. What a shame and woe to anyone who buys this disc."
4,GE Lamps 82143 50-Watt Reveal with Halogen Floodlight,Works fine. Actually brighter than the original bulb that came with a hood. Somewhat annoyed that I was only allowed to purchase one of them.
4,Livin' Clips,"These lads are ones of the walking US streets wherever round a country and their loud tunes are of problems surrounding-sex, drags, money mostly.Low budget clips of life experiences."
5,"Great Product, Great Price","I've been using Synovicre for my dogs for several years now. It's wonderful to see them being more active and feeling comfortable as a result of this product. It must taste very good to them because they take it as a treat. For a while I was buying it from my vet. However, Amazon charges half the price I was paying the vet and it came in a matter of days by US mail. I'll be continuing to buy this product from Amazon."
3,"Good service, interesting book","The book is very interesting, If definitely makes you think about things that are hidden under the surface."
5,Wonderful read - finally the truth!,"I bought the book to read about farming and homeschooling since I do both. I then realized that what Rod was writing about was my life. I am a Catholic that moved to a farm and has been homeschooling for two years. I am growing an organic garden this year and found a place to buy organic meat. I have taken it one step further, I am hoping Rod reads this and looks into immunizations. If anyone would have told me ten years ago that I would be a crunchy con, I would have laughed them off the farm. I am a crunchy con through and through and though it may seem to some that it is a harder life, it is a happier one. This book is what is missing in the political arena. TRUTH!"
3,people who think for themselves defy category,"So, he's doing a great job living according to his values--I don't think this is so much a revolution among conservatives as a sign that the tired old categories and stereotypes are breaking down. I say this as a person who apparently believes many of the things this author does, and live accordingly, yet call myself a ""liberal"".One question: how does such a strict form of Christianity not lead to more discussion of our moral obligation to the poor? That was a glaring absence as I read."
3,Generally useful but maybe not for the clinician.,"This text has good information; however, constant manipulation of the formulas without explaination makes this text hard to follow. For someone trying to review calculations they have not studied in a while, this text skips the commonly forgotten math (integration) hindering complete understanding. I was often questioning for whom exactly the book was designed. This text has excellent problem sets. Having studied with one of the coauthors, I was a little suprised as her classroom notes would have made a superior text."
4,ABBA in their prime!,"In the midst of the disco era, few recording artists produced music to last beyond the dance floor. ABBA's music from that time not only served the functionality of the immediate need for great dance music, but had substance that sounds fresh 25 years later. Seemingly always able to write pop classics, Andersson and Ulvaeus wrote songs in this era that transcend the traditionally context-dependant medium and serve even now - and perhaps more so! - as examples of the timelessness of truly great songs."
2,Disappointed,"My wife gave me a Rolex, and I swapped it for this watch because I wanted an alarm and electronic features. The watch is cool looking, and very light. But after a year, managing all the functions with a single spin of the stem is tedious and trickly. Plus the bezel has already jammed, which cost me $50 to have fixed. The dealer said that wasn't covered under warranty. Another thing I don't like is there is no second hand."
3,"More concert, less filler","The Rainbow Bridge DVD/VHS is enjoyable as a laughable time capsule. However, being billed as a concert movie, this was anything but. If you purchased the ""Soundtrack"" album to the same movie you will be woefully disappointed since the LP contains great tracks from Hendrix but no performances from Rainbow Bridge (aka Rainbow Ridge) These performances weren't released on CD and Vinyl until about 30 plus years after the fact (and in limited pressings) The same can be said of this bait-and-switch movie. There are some great performances from Hendrix but a lot of it is still missing. Collectors have synced together segments of film and audio and produced some great footage which makes the rounds on the internet (YouTube, etc) but there is still no definitive release of the whole concert on DVD. If you enjoy Hendrix, purchase this and index the portions with his performances, the rest is insipid drivel thinly disguised as a movie."
1,DONT!,"Even the most fanatical Hendrix fan will recoil in horror soon into this film. The deceptive packaging makes it appear to be a concert film... highlighting pics of live footage not from the movie, listing songs which appear only as background tunes and the final insult... the DVD sound mix is a horrible mono wash of low fi. The relatively brief footage of live Hendrix does have some bright spots, but they are overshadowed by cuts to a movie scripted audience no one would care to see. This film is ""bad acid"", save your cash for the good stuff man. =)"
4,Appreciate the Film For Its Own Merits -- A Historical Gem!,"To begin, it would be a mistake to approach viewing this film as a""Jimi Hendrix film."" As I understand it it began as a documentary aboutthe Rainbow Bridge meditation center. When it was filmed nobody knewJimi's death was but two months down the road. The film was supposedlybankrolled by the Brotherhood of Eternal Love (qv) -- the loosely knitcommunal family that first delivered mass quantities of high-qualityLSD and Afghan hashish to the western world.That said, the film could have benefited from some better writing andediting. Still, we are provided a window upon a moment in time andspace when a positive vision of what might have been was still aliveand progressing. Take the film and appreciate it. There will be no morelike it. As strange as it appears at first glance it is valuablehistorical footage that is like none other. The Hendrix footage is justa bonus -- the icing on the sunshine-frosted cake."
3,Hippy Dippy Indeed,"The concert footage and the surf footage are worth 3 stars, but the rest of it's just a lot of rambling (The opening scene with the narrator going on and on about the purpose of the film is rather annoying). I wonder what happened to Mitch Mitchell as he looks like was tripping heavily throughout the concert. I recommend the DVD because it has a separate listing for concert footage."
3,Not like the one aired on tv!,"Can I tell you how disappointed I was when I downloaded this episode of the season finalae of saturday night live, and the Justine Timberlake and Lady GaGa skit was omitted. OMG! That was one of the highlights of the show. I don't know who made the decision to sell this episode without including that skit, but had I known, I would never have wasted my money! The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because the episode was still pretty good considering. So, buyer beware! There is no Justine Timberlake and Lady GaGa skit like on the original airing! Sooooooo disappointed!!!!"
1,edited,"the shows are edited. I bought one episode of elton john, he was great did not get to see him perform with leon russel as that was edited out :( sadly I had to be bombared by 20 minutes of irratating snl news. how I miss chevy"
5,Best Ever!,This cookbook is filled with home made meals like the one's my Mom use to make when I was a child. My family has enjoyed the new recipes I have been cooking from this cookbook for them. Also all the tips and hints are refeshing to find in a cookbook.You must have this cookbook!
4,LOW COST ALTERNATIVE,"This product will not turn you into a software developer, but at least you won't spend a couple of years attempting to master Visual Basic or C++. People can knock Instant.EXE, but it -Is-What-It-Is-! Instant.EXE fills the need to write usefull applications without wasting a lot of time and money! Compare $20-$50 for Instant.EXE to a whopping $750 for a useable Microsoft application suite! If you just want some of your own applications, this is it. If you want more than that, learn the .NET platform."
4,Thanks Amazon for featuring one of the best.,"One of the best ""creature features"" ever made ranking up there with The Thing (1950). The Brits know how to make the black and white spook films like X The Unknown. The black and white is crisp but moody, the scary sounds crawl up your spine announcing the strange appearance of THE DEMON. And Dana Andrews' low skeptic dialogue is in great contrast to what's really out there! Thanks Amazon!"
4,The Elements of Fantasy and Fiction,"The DVD describes the most-common elements of fantasy writing, and then lists several types of heroes and monsters. The focus is on the Lord of the Rings, Beowulf and Arthurian legends.I am glad that while mentioning ""dragons"", they did mention the different symbolism dragons play in western and eastern mythology.More than just an entertainment, the symbolism works upon one's unconscious (subconscious mind) and the heroic quest and conquering of an assortment of monsters can be viewed as a symbolic representation of inner growth and realization of one's potential which can only be known by facing and overcoming apparent obstacles on one's path."
4,Five stars for style; minus one for content.,"I recommend this book highly because of the way the information is presented, but I was able to find a number of factual errors (I was also a Netware 4.11 CNA, so I was familiar with most of the material). This book makes an excellent review tool, but it probably should be supplemented with a good set of computer-based tests, since the practice questions in this book don't bear much resemblance to the ones on the CNA test. Combined with the number of errors in the test, that means that this book should not be your only source of information if you want to pass the test (which I did without much trouble)."
1,Worst purchase,This is the 3rd rider I've bought for my 4yr old son and the worst! Electrical IS a problem but so is the dump itself. You cannot fill with anything cause there isn't a back to keep it in and it also doesn't lift very high to empty anyway. We can't even put wood logs in it. I paid $199 not $299 but was a big waste of money. Haven't called yet on the electrical. You need to be super strong to take out the battery charger.
5,Will satisfy any appetite,"In Fabulous Lo-Carb Cuisine, Ruth Glick presents a culinary wealth of more than a hundred easy to prepare recipes ideal for anyone seeking delicious, nutritious meals that are low in carbohydrates. From Hot Artichoke and Spinach Dip; Broccoli-Cauliflower-Pecan Salad; Asian Steak; and Italian Chicken with Peppers and Onions; to Philly Cheese Steak; Mexican Stuffed Peppers; Almond Coconut Candy; and Hazelnut Truffles, Fabulous Lo-Carb Cuisine offers a diversity of dishes that would grace any meal and satisfy any appetite."
4,Too many carbs!,"I love this book, it has great recipes. However a lot of them have 10 or more carbs, at least the main dishes. Once you have a main dish with 10 carbs you can't really add any of the delicious side dishes. I would recommend this book, just watch the carbs."
3,Okay mystery,"""Buried Diamonds"" is a mystery with a historical element since there were flashbacks to events that occurred in 1952 and 1944. While the mystery was interesting and the solution not obvious, the clues weren't as subtle as they could have been. However, it felt realistic that Claire and the others didn't figure it out sooner. Like real people, the guilty person let slip things they shouldn't have yet Claire and the other characters ""heard"" what they assumed was meant rather than what was actually said.The characters were varied and sometimes quirky. The suspense was created by tension in personal relationships and from physical danger. The setting details did a good job of bringing the story alive in my imagination.There was a very minor amount of bad language. It was implied that most of the characters were having unmarried sex, but there were no sex scenes. Overall, it was an interesting mystery."
1,Absolutely Dreadful Recording...,"This particular recording is unplayable. It alternates between passages so soft that they are inaudiable, and others so loud that they blow the roof off. Whoever miked and/or mixed this album did a horrible job. I've heard this symphony many times, including live performances, and never experienced anything like this. It went in the rubbish bin after one playing... however, if you need something to torture your neighbors or the local dog population with, this will be ideal."
2,The little earbuds that couldn't!,"After checking with the Manufacturer to ensure that the ear-buds were the 0 to 20K hz response type, I anxiously awaited their arrival. Already having a set of ear-buds of the same type that were purchased earlier that really were 0 to 20k, I had something to compare the new ones with when they came. Big disappointment. The sound quality on the new package was nowhere near the advertised range of 0 to 20K, and the overall impression of their sound clarity and color was 'muddy' at best. For a company that has the ability to produce an outstanding product, these were a great disappointment, and cannot be recommended at this time."
2,Single Camera video production,The real lack with this text is simply that it was printed in 1982 and technology has moved on.
1,"Cheapest quality, but still useful.","This thing belongs in the 50 cent bin in a flea market in rural china. The packaging is terrible. There's very poorly translated bare bones instructions and no adapter for charging the battery. The one redeeming quality is that the grip is pretty good and fairly secure and feels almost like a regular playstation console controller (which is much more ergonomic than holding the PSP). Too bad the 'rechargeable' part is a total lie. I hope I can get my money back. Save yours for something better. I just got this and could not have been more disappointed. If someone figures out how to charge it, can you tell me?EDIT: I found the charger input. It's not in the directions, nor is it marked, but it's there on the side. But the grip is good and if it can provide 30-60 minutes of fun once or twice when I am stuck with an uncharged PSP, I'll be happy. Still, surprised and disappointed to get something off Amazon this poorly packaged."
3,"Was fun for about a month, then never really used","THis was one of those things that seemed really cool at the time. It was used for about a month, maybe 2 and then we simply stopped using it. It turned out to be more of a novelty thing."
3,Great ergonomic handle but lousy battery charge function,The handle makes playing the PSP much easier and very similar to other game platform controllers but when it is plugged into the PSP as advertised it will not allow any charging and will drain the PSP battery in very short time.I'm not dissapointed with the unit as a whole because all I really wanted when I purchased it was an ergonomic grip which this unit definately has.Even with the limited charge function I would still recommend it for the low price for that reason.
3,Come On!,"I listened to this on audio CD and got really tired of the story line! One too many misfortunes for the main character for me! Not funny after a while! I ejected the CD on Disc 5 (the last one) and said ""Enough""!You will only enjoy this one if you are a real die hard fan; and, I will say, I could never have ""read"" it...."
2,The Grand Finale,"Not one of Janet's better books. I usually enjoy her humor, but humor was very limited in this book. Would not recommend it to others."
5,Every child on earth should have one!,"I love this book... I bought it when I was pregnant and my child is 3 now. He will be four in 3 months. Even now when I look back on the beginning of the book, I am so amazed by how much my child has grown! The book is lovely, I bought it for my little boy but it can be used for a girl as well. It has so much information to put in it that sometimes when I update it, I can't recall some of his milestones that I forgot to record. I advise you to keep it in sight so it will be ready for any achievements that you would like to record. I know that 20 years from now this book will be in wonderful condition and will be nice to show my son how he was as a baby. I really love the rubber band that hold the book closed. Can you say GENIUS?"
2,Horrid packaging!!,"The item arrived on time (early, actually) which is fantastic. When I received, the entire top of the box was torn. It was almost like it was old and was falling apart. Nothing was taped shut. I opened the box and the item doesn't seem to be bent at all (surprising, but good). Other than the packaging, the item is great! My ferrets and my toddler niece who insists on getting in it love it! We don't have room for the 11-panel right now, so we got the smaller one and plan to get expansion panels to make it bigger when we get a new place."
2,good idea but didn't work,"I purchased this to handle a stray kitten I found in my hard. After reading the reviews and description, I thought it would help contain her until I could find a new home. The first night she was able to crawl out of it, and then I had to spend 3 days coaxing her from behind my shelves. It's just not high enough. It needed a cover for the top."
2,problems for some animals,"Good idea, poor execution?I have two ferrets. One of them discovered she could climb out of this pen using the horizontal bars in and around the sliding door as a ladder. Once she learned how, she was out as soon as you gave her five uninterrupted minutes."
2,Engineering needs improvement,"Very lightweight and cool looking, but the engineering needs ALOT of help. The wheels get stuck and don't turn very well and it is a bit too wide to get through doors. I am going to unload on ebay."
2,Total Bummer,"I really loved the first two books, and pre-ordered this for my Kindle.. just arrived and I'm nearly done with it. Mostly because I can't stand reading the bulk of it and skim page after page of boring junk. This book totally lacks the great ideas that the first two had... ideas that always made you wonder, and look forward to how they unfold. ENDYMION not only lacks big ideas, it lacks any sense of suspense... u always either know whats going to happen, or what actually does happen leaves you thinking ""well, that certainly was stupid"".Skip this book...its junk filler from an author that can do great things, but seems to have pumped out a sequel to to cash in on prior excellence."
3,A disappointing sequel to one of the great SF novels.,"HYPERION and FALL OF HYPERION are possibly the two best SFbooks I have ever read, so I was overjoyed when I first heard aboutENDYMION. Unfortunately, the third book just doesn't live up to its predecessors. Where before Simmons took us into a fully-fleshed, politically complex world, we now have a rather simple story, few characters, and none of the literary writing or philosophy found in the first two books. Very disappointing, to my sorrow."
4,Follows the lead set by Hyperion,"Damn good read. It follows on the heels of a book (I consider Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion to be one book in two parts) that is truly phenomenal so to be just average Endymion would have to be exceptionally great, using this new yardstick. Hyperion uses the same 1 book in 2 parts trick which I don't have a problem with, it's still worth the money and you don't have to lug around an L.Ron Hubbard sized tome, but I haven't read the next Endymion yet so there are no ties to any loose ends which is a bit frustrating. I am glad that Dan didn't feel such a strong need to make the cast so pointedly multicultural, although those elements were still there. Not as strong as his first offering but a solid follow up. Maybe in the sequel we will get to see if Endymion actually has any physical limitations."
2,A serious letdown,"Simmons is a very good writer and the writing in this book is fairly good, but it definitely seems a step down from the Hyperion books. It could have used some more editing. It just seemed sloppy.The writing style, however, is the best part of the book. The characters seem rather flat and the plot is contrived. I would almost guess the Mr.Simmons was making it up as he went along. There's a lot of Deus-ex-Machina save-us-in-the-nick-of-time stuff, without a lot of explanation. This is the stuff of bad action movies. There is even a 'super-shrike' now that the shrike is apparently a good guy(kind of like the Terminator movies). I loved Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion is one of my favorite s-f books, but this was so bad I didn't even read the next one. Sorry."
5,Religious attention to the details of the arguments.,"However, future to understand the occurence of 365 inthe discussion of Einstein spectrochemistry, in a 1970 editionof Nash's Classical and Statistical Chemical Thermodynamics,Addison-Wesley... I, not yet understanding the context of365, towards the end of the statiscal volume 2, in thiscombined two volume in one edition, with 2 indexes, andaccordingly, by the author's own statement, the statisticalmechanics more understandable than the volume one, classicalthermodynamics.I am not familiar with the amazon.com version, except to saythat some reticent society of academic publishers somehow give a reference to some formal diurnal understanding,that the inductive understanding of science is a religioustasking.As some year of days, a groping about the text of Nash.However, some number theoretic year of days is strangesoliloquy by Nash.spotter,coastwatcher's grid *N,truk island, south pacific"
4,An old favourite,I saw this film at the cinema when I was a teenager. I have been trying to get a dvd copy for a long time so it was nice to be able to see it again. A little over long at times but it is always good to see Robert Mitchum in action.
2,"Not the ""Holy Grail: that everyone claims it to be","Apart from the brilliant name, there is nothing else in the book that's in the top leagues.This book has a lot of errors in the verbal section (trust me, I know what I'm talking about; I had a V51). Some of the problems in the quant section are quite challenging though.So overall, if you do need extra practice beyond the ""Official Guide"". I suggest you go for the Official Guide verbal and quant books rather than this one. Kaplan 800 is a waste of money, but can be of use for quant if you get it free."
5,Is This One Of The Best Books to Read Aloud Ever? You Bet It Is!!!!,"This book is so much fun to read aloud to my 16 month old daughter. In it the author creates a scenario in which an alligator is creeping closer and closer to where the children are hiding in the apartment asking again and again ""Were the children scared? You BET they were!"" In the end the children overcome their fear and the alligator runs scurrying away. The rhythm of this book combined with the beautiful photos and funny story make it a blast to read at story time."
1,Save your money,The adhesive for this product did not keep the corner covers on. My daughter saw it and ripped it off the first time she saw it. Even if it did work it only comes with enough adhesive to use each corner cover once. This was a waste of money.
4,Hot Hype - Good Lamp,"I bought this lamp to keep an ill African Grey warm. I saw a lot of warnings about the fire danger and they actually made me think that the heat was much more than it is. The heat goes out from the lamp four to five inches before it dissipates altogether. I would have liked for it to be more radiant but it does the job in Hawaii. It does draw lots of current and will increase your electric bill substantially! However, it is a good light and this company is quite reputable."
2,Wouldn't buy it again,The pedals only turn one of the back wheels which actually make this fairly hard to pedal and the plastic wheels just spin on most surfaces.
2,Skip the Kindle Version,The Kindle version was very disappointing - the images were black and white and the index was useless since it had no links back to the referenced item.
3,Not much to say,This book was sufficient enough for the class I used it for. It has very few errata compared to most text books.
5,"Pure uncut and original highlife, the way you would want it","This CD is one of the best highlife compilations that i have. i am not a ghanaian and i could not understand a word of the lyrics in most of the tracks but it never really mattered. i am virtually familiar with all the old and current stars of Ghanaian highlife i.e E.T Mensah, Nana Ampadu, Alex Konadu, A.B Crentsil etc but this compilation contains mostly lesser known artists. The title ""electric highlife"" really describes the tracks as it contains some very good guitar works. If you like nice guitar rhythms and really want highlife music that is original, you cannot go wrong with this compilation. It is a mixed bag and there is something for everyone. i particularly like tracks 1,2,4,5,6,7 and 11"
1,OMG This product has Xylitol in it! Xylitol will kill a dog!!!,"This product has Xylitol in it!According to the ASPCA:Xylitol is used as a sweetener in many products, including gum, candy, baked goods and toothpaste. It can cause insulin release in most species, which can lead to liver failure. The increase in insulin leads to hypoglycemia (lowered sugar levels). Initial signs of toxicosis include vomiting, lethargy and loss of coordination. Signs can progress to recumbancy and seizures. Elevated liver enzymes and liver failure can be seen within a few days.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNTIL THEY CHANGE THEIR INGREDIENTS!!!"
4,Thorough overview of php and mysql,This book can serve both as a reference guide as well as a practical introduction to php mysql. The book has a wider scope by not only exposing the reader to advance php programming and practical examples but also a detailed overview of mysql which is usually not found in php programming books. My only gripe is that the book could be written better in terms of style but overall this is a very good book to buy.
1,Get with the times,The mixes of this album lack any depth or quality. The songs are extremely outdated and outplayed. This album even insults top 40 listeners.
4,Good Club CD,"This is a great dance CD. It's got some great tunes on. However, two of the songs don't belong in the collection, ""Nobody's Supposed to be Here"" and ""Kiss the Rain,"" which are both ballads."
5,NOVOTNI PROVIDES READER-FRIENDLY GUIDE TO SOCIAL SKILLS,"Michele Novotni's newest book is easily one of the best and most useful books that anyone with ADD could read. Novotni provides exellent advice that, while insightful, is also easy to read and understand. Pick up this book today and watch your relationships with others begin to improve immediately!"
5,lyrical pianist,John O'Conor is a lyrical pianist who plays with beautiful tone. He is not so aggressive as some other pianists and has made a beautiful recording of Beethoven piano sonatas. He keeps strict tempo. It is a wonderful introduction to Beethoven and John O'Conor. He has also recorded all of the sonatas in a complete set. But this single CD is a good introduction and not so expensive as the whole set.
5,I love it!,"The magnets are plenty strong, it is nice looking, and small enough to fit on any metal surface in a kitchen. Not big enough for a kitchen towel, say, to dry without folding it over a little."
4,Magnetic Towel Bar,"The towel bar works well but make sure it's where you want it when you put it on a metal surface. When I tried it out on my white refrigerator I had difficulty removing it because the magnets are so powerful. When I pulled, the magnets came unstuck from the towel rods and I had to glue them back. When I finally pried them off, a little white paint came off the frig. Other than that I'm very happy with the towel rod."
3,An Ignored but Enjoyable Disc,"After I purchased this disc, I read some reviews and most was less than favorable, but as is often the case, listeners discover what critics pan is often very good. This disc is certainly an enjoyable recording and both Francisco Araiza and Eva Lind do an adequate job. The three duets from the French repertoire (LAKME, MANON and ROMEO ET JULIETTE) are the discs best arrangements. The Donizetti and Verdi duets are somewhat weaker, but each is performed reasonably well. None of the pieces would be my favorite renditions of the works, but the disc does offer an interesting mix.It is unlikely that this disc will be re-released since it was not a top seller when it was first issued, but from time to time it does become available. Since it now would be a discount recording, it is worth purchasing and adding to a collection. It may not be a first choice but it can be enjoyed from time to time."
3,"Fuji should get a better casing - it creates a vacuum, and hard to remove from the tape itself.","Fuji's cardboard case the tape comes in is too tight. It creates a vacuum, and is very difficult to remove without ruining the case."
3,Disney carousel,"My 4 year old loves this carousel. Especially the horse and music. She has a hard time getting the princesses to stay without falling out, but when they sit properly she loves it. I rated durability low bc it would probably break if sat on accidently. Definately for 3+."
4,Hollerin',"The only remaining recording of some of the early National Hollerin' Champions and competitors. It should be included in the Library of Congress & National Archives, along with the other documentaries that are already there, if it has not been done already. An updated version with additional recordings of more recent champions would be nice, as well, along with an oral history of the National Hollerin Contest & cultural history of the ""almost lost art of hollerin'."""
5,Thorough scholarship and somewhat prescient,"This is an extremely pertinent book for the next millenium. It is also quite popular in policy circles inside the Beltway. It is an indeispensible text for all Americans concerned with the future of international trade and the ongoing pathologies of our current trade regimes and the power relations they sustain to the detriment of the vast majority of human beings and the planet. It is thorough and scholarly throughout. While it is best read with a cup of Joe on a rainy day, it is worth the time and pays rereading many times over in light of current events. It's only shortcoming is it's neglect of the ecological dimensions of international trade and politics, nevertheless, it is a book for all who care about the human future."
4,Inconsistant,"Ordered 2 stands. One was retail package, the other bulk packaging. One had a rubber foot, the other didn't. Stand itself is decent, but very inconsistent item packaging."
5,The worlds best kickstand,"This is the world best kickstand and comes in black and alloy. It is light, easy to fit and has a great spring. I now have one on all three of my mountain bikes"
4,"Stand works, not all items included.","I purchased a pair of these kickstands for my children's new bikes. Cutting them down to size was not an issue - just follow the included directions.My issue was with the packaging / included items. I received the item in a sealed plastic bag which is the 'bulk packaged' version. The bag did not include a rubber foot as shown in the one (user added) photo of the packaging. The description is silent on whether it is included, though at least one reviewer stated that it could come in bulk packaging.Seeing as how most comments discussing the rubber foot stated it was included, I took a chance. I would have liked to add the rubber foot, but it is not critical. Still, it would have been a 5-star review had it either been included, or if the product description (and picture) stated whether it was included or not."
5,"A very nice, good quality, inexpensive phone with extras.","Notes to the person with the problems:There is a little ribbed nib on the earpiece part of the cradle. If you remove it and slide it back in upside down, it makes a little hook, which securely holds the phone in place when it's on the wall. You can also extend your cord by buying an inexpensive coupler (female to female) that links the existing cord from your phone (yes, it does come out of the receiver part) to the new, long cord, which you then plug back into the receiver.I have one too and it's a nice-looking, inexpensive little phone that sounds nice too and has some good basic features. It stores 50 numbers in caller ID, which is easy to see and scroll through. I am very happy with this little phone and will be buying a couple more for other rooms in the house."
2,577 Adapter,"Agin way to big for what I needed, but was able to return it with out and problems. Needs to have a better disciption on it site."
3,Strong product but messy,"Carmex has always been an old standby for me when my lips were especially chapped or I had a cold sore with which to contend and, indeed, the formula of the original Carmex in the jar is quite strong, something you can tell from the harsh taste and smell, but it's extremely messy to apply and wear. Your fingers will wind up with a greasy residue and, unfortunately, your lips will feel just as greasy as well.Carmex will do the job but you'll need to suffer the ""side effects""; it's too messy and harsh to use on a daily basis"
5,Very pleased!,This DVD arrived promptly and was exactly as described. I would definitely do business with this vendor again. Very pleased!
5,Hidden memories? or not?,"A woman is brutally attacked and sustains a concussions and has recurring epiletic episodes because it. She is sure it was her husband - partially from the fact they were having very bad marital problems and he had abused her in the past. Because of this, he goes to jail -- but later another man confesses and he is released.She now has to come to terms that he may not have been the one who attacked her -- but she is still sure of it in her own mind.I had an accident and sustained a concussion (it was a pedestrian/auto and I had no recurring seizures) but I know what she was going through and what she remembered and did not remember. I remember coming to curb of the street but did not remember the pickup hitting me - or did I?Fantastic book. I recommend it."
3,OK.,"This is a strategy that some siblings got together and decided on for themselves, and it may be helpful to other siblings. However, most of this book is geared to siblings who already get along well and can overcome difficulties in communication to begin with. It's an OK offering for sane families without much baggage."
2,Make sure you have the right cabinets!,"These look like they would work, but the only way they will fit on your cabinets is if you have the kind that the doors are flush with the rest of the cabinetry. Our cabinet doors sit out from the edges of the cabinets so this product will not work as the lock goes on the cabinet itself.Can't say how the lock works itself as I was not even able to install them."
4,Works as advertised,This lock was easy to install and is a good option for securing the lazy susan cabinets from an 18-month old.
1,Junk,"Worked for a couple of months, then stopped locking. now the just hang there. Have to find another way to keep the kids from pinching fingers in the lazy susans"
2,Works great while it lasts!,"We have the same problem-the lock lasts a few months (its hard plastic, so it isn't very forgiving) then we have to replace it. We looked at some other options too, but they would require drilling into the front of the cabinet and trim and I don't want to do that. As it is, the last one just broke a week ago and I'm frustrated at cleaning up flour, etc. so everything sits in a tub on the table. If you don't mind replacing it often (order a few to start with-for $3 you can always sell them later if they don't get used), then this is a decent buy!"
1,Does not work with bi-fold doors.,I bought this product to use on my large lazy susan bottom cabinet. There is no way to install it on the bi-fold door. Tried many different locations to no avail. Don't buy unless you have a normal cabinet door.
1,Does not work for all lazy susan cabinets,"I was hopeful when I ordered these cabinet locks, as my daughter has been actively invading our corner cabinets lately, and our best deterrent previously has been a rubber band stretched between the cabinet knob and the knob of the nearest drawer...Hubby the engineer's analysis is that these latches will only work if your lazy susan cabinet doors are the old-fashioned type that are one solid piece. If you have the modern type that hinge in the middle these latches will not work. I'll be honest, after looking at the latches for quite a while I'm not sure that they would even work on the older style cabinets...Anyway, these aren't worth returning, because it would cost me more than they are worth to send them back. I guess I'm going back to rubber bands for a bit until I can track down a set of the magnetic-key style latches locally (I've been told they usually work.)"
4,GOOD CARD READER BUT LOOK AROUND FIRST,"This is one of the fastest card readers i have used. Good card reader but look around Amazon before you purchase this card reader. Only after I purchased this reader, I realized that there are card readers on Amazon that read xd cards and are also cheaper."
3,"Good sound, but does not charge Nano 4G","The ""line out"" jack included in this unit had good sound, better than the sound from the headphone jack. This output is always the same volume which is often a good thing. However, it does not charge the Ipod Nano 4G."
3,"Works well as a charger, but does not isolate power hum","I use this all the time in my car to provide power to my iPod. It works as advertised in all areas but one.... When the iPod is attached to the charger and the car's radio, there is significant power ""hum"" audible in quieter parts of songs.I usually use the charger while the iPod is off to charge it, but disconnect the charger from the car's power outlet when actually listening to music. Not that much of a problem as the iPod quickly gets to a full charge with the charger - and then I can listen to music on that charge for as long as I am willing to be in the car ;-)"
2,Broke after a year,"I bought this in April 2006. It worked fine until last month when the output started being finicky and putting out static until today it finally died. The headphone out works fine, so it's not the cable or my car. It was a good product until it half died (charging still works), wish it would have lasted longer than a year and a half though."
5,monster cable ipod charger,"i've used two igo brand ipod chargers and they both broke. this one has an audio out at the dock connector and looks beautiful. it doesn't stick out very far from the plug and the led tells you the the status of the charge. i use a direct line to the stereo (not fm modulation, not fm transmitter, not tape adapter) and i don't get any noise from the charger (which was an issue raised by reviewers of the belkin version). great value!"
1,This doll made me vomit on my designer silk DKNY pants,"I hate the way that mattel is trying to sell products these days. Mattel is encouraging children to be older than they are, flaunting their legs in public or showing their belly buttons. Like who would even want to buy this pitiful excuse for a lump of plastic. the only good thing about this product is that my family was able to use it to unclog the toilet. Mattel you need to think of different designs inorder to sell products. I mean, since sponge bob square pants barbie this is the worst toy i have ever seen. their clothes are so dagy it looks like they just came out of a garbage can. they are so annoying i cannot express my utmost mate for them. If i could give you some advice it would be not to but this filth, mattel you must be pretty desperate to get ""new audience of older children"". So far i have only used this product as - a toilet cleaner- a chew toy for my dog- a means to take out my frustrationMattel you are some sad, sad people."
1,Author is totally misinformed/wrong on the Bengal Breed,"This author has clearly never been around a Bengal nor owned one! There are no truths to her claims that Bengals attack without provacation, urine smells so strong that other cats hate them, dmestic cats are stacked out to breed with wild! Indeed! This womam needs to get her facts straight before writing a ""help"" and ""informational"" book! Quite the contrary is true on the Bengal, intelligent, loving, playful, gets along with all other cats and dogs, IS NOT A HYBRID but a DOMESTIC CAT! I have 12 Bengals and 4 dogs and 4 Cats and they all get along GReat!"
3,Great book-some misinformation about the spotted Bengal cats,"Very factual and interesting. A great book to have......when they rewrite the section about the new spotted, leopard-like breed called the Bengal cat. There is so much misinformation about the breed that the Iams company is going to rewrite the section regarding this interesting and very popular breed. Wait to purchase this book, it will be worth the wait. I would rate this book a 10 if it had accurate and fair information about Bengal cats."
5,"Cave of the Siddhars Powerful, Transforming & Pure Joy","to date...this may be my very favorite cd,to take me deep within the self.What a beautiful Journey."
5,It makes me want to close my eyes and dance,"I like the selection of instruments, the mellow trance-like rhythm and deep male vocals. It makes me want to close my eyes and dance. There are many layers to this music that unfold as you go and special effects that shine through along the way. This is a fabulous collection for an amazingly low price."
4,Good information,"Unfortunately, this book has a huge number of typos. One is very ridiculous: Bostonia, instead of Bosnia. Otherwise this book has a lot of behind-the-closed -doors information. The author made a great effort to put together such information. The chapter about the occult and anti-Christian origins of Hitler's ideology is truly great. This book is written from a white magic point of view, and presents the anti-Christian New Age movement (with all its aspects: feminism, permissive sexuality, ecology etc) as the future religion. Strange, but the author of this book that reveals so well conspiracies, is pro-conspiracy!"
1,Still waiting for delivery 1 month later!,It's been a month now and I am still waiting for the second half of my products! Where are they? I need these for a wedding asap! Very disappointing
5,made me enjoy jazz and piano in a whole new way,"I just bought this incredible work after hearing it played on KCSM in San Mateo. Words to describe it should include: precise, inventive, playful, beautiful, expressive, exciting. The pieces have no difficulty in moving between highly disparate idioms such as blues, 20th century music (I hear Bartok, Webern, Stravinsky), impressionism, and bop. There is not a dull moment on this CD; it develops constantly and has enough ideas to satisfy throughout. This is my favorite jazz in quite some time."
3,I can't configured the Routers Lab,"I have a hard time configuring the Routers .. everytime I type ""config t""- the window will closed..2-4 times I tried .. the same thing happened... isn't me or the software.. can somebody help me with my problem."
5,"Sue Fabisch's ""Music 4 Mommies"" Fantastic",Being a mother of seven and grandmother of eight I totally relate with this C.D. I loved it so much I purchased two of Sue's first C.D. and look forward to her next C.D. in December. I am her number one fan after her family.
3,Enjoyable classical music,"Until recently, I was not aware of the classical music of Ottorino Respighi. But I have to admit that his music has made an impression on me ever since I listened to an old record of his material. Subsequently, I acquired this CD, and I am glad that I did. All three of the CD's pieces are enjoyable--""Pines of Rome,"" ""The Birds,"" and ""Fountains of Rome."" My favorite of the three is ""Pines of Rome,"" one of my favorite classical music compositions in general. The CD's sound quality is also nice. The music is performed by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Louis Lane. The CD booklet includes an essay of Respighi, too. In addition, the CD's cover illustration is not only attractive, but also captivating. The CD is just over 54 minutes. Actually, I rate this piece of work 3.5 stars. It is recommendable."
3,not bad,this is a good product but it didn't come with the wire. and I need to get the wire from homedepot. and also no light bulb.but it can do a great job.
4,Best SQL book I had,It is bit of old book but it is best for bingers who need jump start for SQL programming and do not care about new oracle features. It starts from very basics but then it takes you to pretty high level.
3,Not Necessarly for Everyone,"This may not be the best film in the history of cinema, but it is one of my alltime favorites. You get the feeling that much of the dialog was mafe up as it went along and like other Robert Altman films there are frequently several people talking at once and it can be a bit difficult to follow. It doesen't matter, the whole plot is crazy start to finish and charactors are all over the top. This is not your typical romantic comedy, watch with an open mind and you may just love this!!"
1,Over priced manual,I was dissapointed with quality of the book. I expected the quality to be a little better than just a black and white photo copied spiral bound book. The example pictures in the book would have been better had they been in color. The price of this book is way over priced.
2,"Good story, horribly written","Ordinarily, when I pick up a true crime novel, I have trouble putting it down. I've always been fascinated by what humans can do to other humans. But this book took me longer to read than any other book I've read as far back as I can remember. I just could not get into it. The writer's style did absolutely nothing for me - and the ""sections"" he divided the book into made no sense at all. Plus he couldn't decide on a name to call each of the main characters, so he just jumps around from variation to variation. It's fine to do that a bit at first so you can get a feel for the characters, but after a while you really have to pick one! And I really didn't like how in the beginning, each chapter alternated between past and present. Sometimes that works, but here it just didn't. Don't waste your time with this one...instead try Last Dance, Last Chance by Ann Rule."
2,Not what was expected,"I thought, based on other reviewers, this would be an excellent choice. Was disappointed. It was very bland, even trying to doctor it up with extra butter and salt didn't work. Very disappointed. We will be doing homemade mac and cheese from now on using whole wheat macaroni."
4,Better than the usual,"My kids like this Mac & Cheese even better than the ""standard"" blue box brand. The fact that it is better for them than the usual is just icing on the cake."
1,Absolutely horrible!,Oh my god this film is really gross I do not want to watch it again. I rented it thinking it was going to be good but it's really disturbing. It's the story on Dahmer where we see him hunting for men and he brings them into his apartment and actually rapes them. We see that he's raping aisan and blacks. I do not want to see that again. That is really wrong and a sick system. The movie is really slow too. Please don't waste time watching it!
4,Brilliant film along the lines of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,"Jeremy Renner is phenomenal in this. He gives a very chilling and believable performance. In a perfect world where genre films receive Golden Globe / Academy Award attention, this would be a Best Actor contender.Don't go into this film expecting blood, guts, or even kills. Yes, there is violence, but this isn't your typical horror movie. If you enjoyed Renner in The Hurt Locker, this is a must-see. Kathryn Bigelow cast him off of this."
1,dumhar,What a stupid movie!!No details not that violent and very slow.Why do they make movies like this ? Why not show the span of his life and events that mde him what he is rather than on night with stupid flashbacks? they never learn I know they didn't hav a budget but damn!!
2,weak,"I was expecting a story of his life but there was little substance here. Not badly acted, but boring and no story."
3,Could have been Better but was okay,The only reason this movie does not fall into a Movie of the Week category is because it gave the villan some humanities. But it was not enough to save the film. Jeremy Renner did a great job with what he was given.
3,Boring!,"Dahmer's acts were barely touched on in this film. I felt this movie delt more with him on a light level. The director tried to make him too human for my taste. There should have been more of his acts (not gore), but just how twisted he was. However, if you just want a light, yet creepy feel for Dhamer, then this movie is for you. It's not a bad film, just disapointing."
1,Haven't bought but have compared,"Can you believe the regular price on this is $119.00 with no tv screen or video recorder on top? I saw this Karaoke machine in ToysRUs it looked like it said $19.99 but they had wrote in a one (it didn't look like a one). When they told me the regular price was $119.00 (wouldn't even look at it really), I didn't believe him, because the display had an old sticker on it (the sticker was faded and looked like the old stickers they used) that said $59.99 which he said was the price it would be now with half off. Don't seem like a sale to me! Where is the features? Something didn't not feal right about that, so unless I've missed something I would look at another Karaoke machine. My friend doorbusted a better one last year for $35.00 (it had a tv screen)."
4,"Last minute bag, not weather proof but great bag","We found out last minute we needed an extra bag to fit everything in on the way home from vacation.We found everything we wanted online (a lot cheaper online then figured) we couldn't get anything on time for the trip. We ended up at sports authority and found the bag for I believe $80. Not a bad price, we checked the hard top carriers and they were all over priced like $300 or more. It was easy to install and we fit 4 black garbage bags full of clothes in the bag. It did make wind noise with the straps, although we were going 90 on the interstate. But we got used to the sound and just fixed them everytime we had to stop. The clothes were damp inside the carrier once we did make it home, but we also went through a ton of rain, a blizzard and strong wind. I would except that to happen. We drove 1,500 miles and it was totally worth the money to save room in the car."
4,Thule Quest Cargo Bag,"very pleased with our Thule #846 Quest Cargo bag. Traveled from NJ to S.C and back with no problems. Stayed in pleased, didnt hear any noise from tie down straps.I would definately recommend this product!"
1,HOrrible!,"We strapped it according to directions on the top of our car. It rained some and was windy one day, but not downpours. Even though we had everything inside in super strong zip locks--everything (EVERYTHING) got soaked.I know it said it was water resistent (I think that was the word they used) but come on--this was bad!So I returned the item and Amazon makes it so easy to return.Elaine"
3,"A truly interesting story, but a difficult read...","Kay Cordell Whitaker's book detailing the beginnings of her life as a shamanic practioner is a great story but - in the humble opinion of this double degree Lit grad - is hard reading. Whitaker's literary style in itself is simple, but nearly ALL of the book is composed of direct quotations from her teachers, which becomes rather exhausting after a while and, for those looking to get quickly to the meat of a story, drags that meat as though it were on a teasing stick before the reader. Ironically, the highlights of the book are actually the little stories told by her male teacher, of spiritual life in his native village in South America. If you're a patient soul, and you can get all the way through this, I am certain you will gain much. Personally, I found Paradise Lost a breeze compared to this..."
1,No blue ribbons at the fair for these recipes!,Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! The recipes were terrible. Would anyone actually eat popcorn and milk mixed together?!! Is it really a recipe to just make popcorn and add it to milk?!! And the butter recipe was terrible. Butter is the easiest thing in the world to make... just add cream to a jar with a lid and shake. Why would you add a carrot to the cream? Why make it complicated? And do I really need a cookbook to make oatmeal or a butter and jam sandwich?
3,"Good, but a little misleading...","L'Aloge's book is chock-full of wonderful and intriguing stories. However, despite the title of said book, most of the stories presented serve more as ""food for thought"" rather then actual mysteries. There are only a handfull of mystery and ghost stories in this book. Still, it makes for a good read, if only for those stories alone. A definite read for Old West/history buffs, but those who are into the more supernatural might want to steer clear."
4,A lesson of life!,"Amateur is according the Greek meaning: all those who love what they do .And somehow the spirit of constant and ascendant improving established the difference in Foster that day when the cheat was done. He imposed to himself the maximum penalty to finish with that hard and unbearable memories.But when he watches that young promise who tries by all means to get close him and knowing about him, he will feel the last call and something inside him it will awake.This slow paced but interesting script is a lesson of life, the constancy, tenacity and work ness will never lead you to a dead zone. Something is watching you and sooner or later the truth will shine.Along the film there are another secondary lines that support the script: the caddy world, the racism and the secret passions. Splendid photography and a brilliant performance of Gary Sinise and Phillip Baker Hal confer this movie an artistic status."
1,nothing special,"A straightforward simple tale of Pano the locomotive who leaves the station with his caboose behind. He does not realize his error. As he passes animals and people they try to tell him something is wrong, at the end he realizes what it is.Nothing special about the story itself or the illustrations. There is a similar tale in ""Thomas the Tank Engine: The Complete Collection"". The large Thomas book is superior in content, it has many, many stories and wonderful illustrations.Even my train-addicted boys were uninterested in this story!"
3,Not the color depicted online,"I ordered this rug in what looked like a violet, navy and grey pattern, but when it arrived it was nothing near that. It is navy, orange and grey. It is just the right size fore my dorm room, it arrived on time and it is soft so I am going to keep it but I am very diappointed with the colors. I dont understand the error because even on the slip inside the packaged rug the image checked off for which color I ordered is clearly purple and blue. They look nothing alike."
4,not half bad,"Best for clarity and distance of the 1/2 dozen line of sight (high frequency) cordless phones I have. Still looking for reviews of AT&T 9515 /9520 which claim 4,000 foot range. Guess I'll have to buy one of those also to check it out."
2,The Sounds of Silence,"I bought the Panasonic 2.4Ghz phone because my roommates all had 900Mhz phones and I didn't want my calls interfering with their's. It worked great for about a month, then just suddenly stopped working altogether. I have yet to discover the problem and now have to send it back to Panasonic in hopes of getting one that works."
2,Life savers are sour,The service may have been great but the life savers weren't. Some of them were old and crumbled when I opened the package and I found myself looking for an experation date.
2,Disappointing to say the least,The new softcover edition is of very poor quality compared to the original hardcover. The photos look like they are photocopies of the originals. It's nice that this book has been reprinted (it's a classic) but the cheap paper used really makes the quality suffer. Do your best to find a hardbound copy at a reasonable price before getting this edition.
4,Very Good Value,"The SC 340 works as advertised. It is very easy to set up and use. However, it did not control the on-screen menus on a RCA Satellite box, although it can turn the device on and off, change volume, channels , etc. The bulletin board at the Jensen web site does acknowledge this, but the information is buried in the customer bulletin board."
2,a continuation of the debt,"In ""The Reckoning"", Robinson goes about analyzing exactly what went wrong with the African American race. Yet once again, the blame inevitably falls on ""whitey"". Most of the book is a regurgitation of its predecessor, claiming that the government should pay reparations to the blacks in the US. Almost no attention is paid tho the faults of the blacks(for example their tendancy to blow money on fancy cars, jewelry, clothing, etc., instead of giving money back to the community)."
1,quality control for Rosle Made In China is low,"I love Rosle products and have bought many over the years. I enjoy the function and high quality control in manufacturing for most of their products. Recently, however, some 'made in china' Rosle products have had serious quality control issues. This item--Hook Fish Slice--is one that has issues.I returned my 'fish slice' the day after receiving it because I felt a rough, unfinished edge along the front. The brushed steel handle is also quite different from the (made in germany) handles (of which I have many) with the brushing being very course (instead of fine).I will continue to buy Rosle, even if they're made in China, but I'll return any and all that don't match the quality of made in germany items."
5,Imerse yourself in this great story.,"This is one of those books it is hard to put down, because the story is well written and her life was very interesting. I highly recommend this book."
4,"Good choice, VERY short","After reading the other reviews I ordered a size bigger than I would normally wear and was glad I did. Overall, I was really happy with the costume for Halloween this year. If you are tall, you will DEFINITELY need to order a petticoat to wear underneath. It is included in the picture, but not with the costume - I am 5'8'' and I would have been flashing people if I had not worn one."
1,Terrible,"If you're willing to buy a story where two badly armored crooks invade a police stattion and take on numerous heavily armed, heavily armored cops, then you might actually enjoy the movie.The plot is terrible, with more holes than the average bullet-filled corpse. Acting is also terrible, with 'Bubbles' being exceptionally poor.The basic storyline is that a London crimeboss is taking out the competition to ensure a merger of his 'company' with a big US crime syndicate. After the killing of a rival in a park, a witness survives, and the hunt is on.On first glance, this sounds like a Guy Ritchy or Tarantino plot, but where those directors manage to create exceptional dialogue and bizarre plot twists, this one just lacks. It starts off rather bad, and goes downhill from there.Stay away from this one, unless you have a serious knack for random violence and gore."
1,sux,Not what I expected. I need to know specifically which items I can ship outside the US and which I can't. This did not help at all.
1,"Great music, good performance - but terrible recording.","The music may be great and the performance may be great, but the recording (or the piano - but I doubt that) is terrible. The piano sounds like it's made of cheap metal (if that were possible) - everything sounds ""tinny"". The higher registers sound shrill and thin, the middle registers are flat and lifeless, and the lower notes lack any depth or resonance. A real disappointment."
2,As irritating as a non-contoured mask.,"I've used the ""old"" style non-contoured silk eye masks for years now but they are quite irritating to my eyes to have something pressing against them, and for years that I've been using them, I constantly fight with them to adjust them to try to make them comfortable and allow me to go to sleep, so I saw this one and bought it thinking this is the be all, end all last mask I'll have to buy. Unfortunately that is not so, for me there is still pressure in the wrong places around my eyes and I've had to go back to the old flat non-contoured eye masks until I can find another contoured mask that works for me. I attribute this masks failure to work for me due to my size. I am a large person and have a large head (John Wayne has nothing on my stetson hat size), and this might not be a good solution for others that are not ""average"" size beings."
2,So so,So so game with difficult controls for the missions and lackluster overall simulation Wing over Vietnam same.
4,eh eh,the idea behind the book is great but the theology has some serious question marks on some of the answers Grandpa provides...I would recommend some caution there.
4,Works very well with my iMac computer.,"I am impressed at the ease with which this scanner works. I have an Apple iMac, and all I did was install the software, plug into my USB port, and I was ready to go. A CON though: there is no printed manual. I still like to have a printed manual."
3,An Ambitious Attempt,"Volume IV of this series is an ambitious attempt to explain the details of the battles of Stones River, Chancellorsville, Brandy Station and Gettysburg. The 77 minutes is replete with historical commentary from experts, photographs, maps and reenactment scenes of the respective battles. The major weakness of this video is the difficulty of making clear the intricacies of each particular battle, as much action occurred at various times and places at each battle over a period of days.This video can not be compared to the masterful film of Burns on the Civil War, but is hardly inferior to ""Civil War Combat."" Positively one is able to see the very battlefields in question and the sites of their major activity. Also, the reenactments provide vivid imagery for Civil War fans to enjoy."
3,Too much history,"This book spends way too much time covering the history of every chipset, processor, motherboard, and everything else. Much of it is obsolete. If you want to learn how to upgrade and repair PCs this is not the book for you. It assumes that you can already do the physical process of adding and removing parts. Although, a lot of that is found on the DVD. They need to stop building on 17 editions worth of technology and take some stuff out. Otherwise it is a great book and there is still tons of non-obsolete material. It has a great reference guide in the back."
4,Good book but not practical,It's a good book but not too practical. It goes into too many details you won't need as a PC repair tech. Look for a more general guide
4,Building a PC,The Book helps me very much in building a PC from scratch. This was my first time and the book kept me from having to call someone to help me when I ran into a problem.
3,Background stand,"Nice and tall, but kind of flimsy. Does not hold the roll of seamless paper well at all. Too top heavy. But for a regular backdrop it works fine."
3,Not exactally as described,Ordered this to use with my kitten. It doesn't look like the photo. It looks like jeans. The product works great though
5,'THE' Best of the bunch. Well crafted horror- NO Vampire.,"I do not read vampire books AND this is not Vampire book. But the book is so GOOD that I will read this author's other books- which are Vampire books!This is grand scale,small town, multi characters,bloody,atmospheric horror with lots of action,twist, ancient mythology and very GORE,graphic scene. If you like ANY type of horror then this is a must. My rule of thumb is- if ALL reviews of the books on Amazon are good then that book is GOOD... and was I right!"
2,Not Good,"Had the same problem as one the other reviewers. There are two plastic grommets that hold the jig in the correct position on the support arm above the sharpening stone. They (the grommets) keep coming out of the jig. When one, or both, of the grommets come out, the jig wobbles and you cannot properly sharpen. I tried gluing them in myself but so far have been unsuccessful in finding a glue that will hold. This could be easily fixed by making the grommets with a lip on the inside that would snap over the inside edge of the hole on the jig. It sounds complicated but if you saw it in person you could see how very simple the fix is."
5,An indispensable collection for beginning students,"James Charlesworth's Old Testament Pseudepigrapha (volume 1) is still the go-to general collection for Jewish apocalyptic literature, but it is too expensive and overwhelming, both in terms of its bulk and the academic style of its commentary, for the typical undergraduate student/beginner . Reddish's slim paperback really gets the job done for that student. It includes at least portions of every important apocalypse outside the Bible, both Jewish and Christian, in an accessible translation with a pertinent introduction for each book. Its scholarship is solid, but at the same time it doesn't confuse the introductory student with debates over points he/she is not yet ready to address. I've used this text in university classes with great success and recommend it highly."
3,Are you serious?,"At the time of this writing the SB-800 is being sold for $595.95 while the SB-900 is being sold at $570.00, but being sold in the $400 range. Even for those who aren't aware, the SB-800 is the predecessor to the SB-900, so paying more for the SB-800 is insanity."
3,"Good flash, but lame user interface.","First of all, this is the last of the Nikon flashes that were made in Japan. The new generations of Nikon flashes are all made outside of Japan.This is not a flash for the casual user. It is a very powerful professional flash, but it is not an easy flash to use. Reading the manual is mandatory and then you need it to accompany you for at least the first few weeks just to get used to it. A lot of functions require a two-button selection. Hence you need 2 hands to set the parameters. Also, the functions are all hidden within menus which you have to get to from other menus. So, changing your parameters during the middle of a shooting is not an easy task.I bought it for the power based on the small footprint. The new SB-900s are a lot bigger. However, the new ones addressed the lame user-interface of the SB-800s.Bottom line, this is a powerful speedlight, but not very intuitive to use."
3,A LONG WAIT,"I WAITED A MONTH FOR THIS HAILEY LIND BOOK, WHICH WOULD BE MY THIRD LIND ART MYSTERY NOVEL, BUT IT NEVER CAME. ON CONTACT WITH AMAZON DEALER, THEY ADVISED BOOK WAS MAILED IN A TIMELY MANNER, BUT MUST HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE MAIL. TO THEIR CREDIT THEY ADVISED THEY HAD NO MORE OF THIS BOOK, BUT CREDITED MY CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT."
3,Attitude sometimes falls short,"After looking over the reviews and excerpts of this book, I was really looking forward to reading it over my vacation. For the first 20 pages or so, this pleasure was realized. Unfortunately, I found the flippant and ""girlfriendy"" tone to be a little grating after a while. While some of the advice was excellent (I now have several additions to my ""must read"" list), I disagreed heartily with some of their reviews and was dismayed to find inaccuracies (like putting ""The Thorn Birds"" in the Mother/Daughter relationship chapter while stating that Meggie and her mother both loved Father Ralph - it was her Aunt who was hot for him!!!).I think this book might be better in small doses so as not to overload on the ""attitude"". I really enjoyed the trashing of several of those awful marketed-to-women self-help books about codependency and how-to-get-a-man-and-keep-him, etc. Carefully recommended."
1,"For $300, I expect a working machine at a minimum","I bought this yesterday and upon taking it out of the box, the wheel and axle assembly broke off. The axle was welded on with a spot weld that broke off as I was removing the cultivator from the box! Terrible design, don't waste your money."
1,Go Mantis,"Bought the Troy-Built cultivator last spring, used 2 times (briefly),worked well. Third time, the pull start broke. Replaced. Second tiller broke after two uses, same problem. The Troy-Built site had many complaints of tillers breaking after a couple of uses.We had a used Mantis cultivator which I gave to my dad after 30 years of use and it's still going strong. Forget Troy-Built, go Mantis."
1,Terrible,"Everyone in this movie is unhappy and miserable. Not much back story, just a bunch of unadjusted adults behaving badly. I really like a movie to have a point, and an ending. Just a cliff hanger here. The only point made in this movie is that no one is happy."
4,It wasn't that bad!,"Redbox & Rotten Tomatoes gave The Romantics horrible reviews but I wanted to give it a try because I love stories about unrequited love. I think the problem is that there isn't much of a plot other than a group of friends getting together the night before for a friend's wedding( they never leave the property for the entire movie). There is a lot of talking. I didn't mind this. I actually loved the scenes between Katie Holmes & Josh Duhamel. I thought Katie Holmes did a good job and I was paying particular attention since the reviews bashed her acting skills. Honestly, I think the reviewers were being way too harsh. I felt her heartache. Anyway, it really depends on what type of movie you're attracted to. You're either going to like it or not. I liked it.~"
1,Sleepy,You never get to know the characters well enough to care.The acting is very good but it doesn't help make it a movie you'll think about ever again.
3,good but ended odd.,"I enjoyed the movie up until the end, I kind of felt cheated on the ending of the movie. Left me going What now?"
3,Too short,It was a bit vague. A surprise ending though. A good movie to watch if you are a bit bored though.
2,Meh....just meh.,"Maybe there's some deeper meaning I missed with this film but I just found it to be so trite and tired...really, one of those times where I say, ""I want my two hours back"" or ""at least we didn't see it in the theater!""I don't enjoy films depicting infidelity and stupidity so perhaps that's the issue. ;)"
2,"At best, its OK","Having not read the book I feel cheated. I now plan to read the book so that hopefully it will give me more incite into these characters. I've read in other reviews that Anna Paquin demolished her character Lila. Which would be about right because I was rooting for Katie Holmes (Laura) the entire time. I honestly thought the movie was mediocre at best. It was also very boring at points as the characters mostly just talk. Even the parts that are supposed to be ""funny"" failed to even bring a smile to my face. There were parts that I almost liked about it, I am a sucker for tragic, angsty, love. However I guess I'm sad in a way because I cannot stand movies that don't at least give us an idea of what happens to the characters. If you're sick and demented and like to watch people cheat on each other and argue for an hour and half, this one's for you. Otherwise ...Save your precious time and watch something else."
3,Dark and a Disappointment,"With a cast of this caliber, I would have thought that the movie would have been well done, but it wasn't. The gifted cast were made to look like amature actors in my opinion. It was also very predictable for the majority of the scenes. Dark and almost depressing, I'm very disappointed."
1,indescribably bad.,"a long, drawn out cliche. plot is overused, characters are written with no depth. two hours lost that i could have spent cleaning out my closet."
1,Reliability problems,"The features and sound quality are top-notch, but I discourage purchase of this product because of reliability problems. I purchased two of these units, one for me and one for my parents. Both units failed within a year because a chip went bad in the phone causing static and disconnection. Panasonic did a good job of repairing my phone and the service tech was familiar with this phone's problem. Nonetheless, my next purchase will not be from Panasonic."
1,The worse phone ever!!!,"I bought this phone when it first came out. It looks pretty nice but kind of expensive. Hoping that this will be the last phone I will get. This phone has so much STATIC that I have to put it on speaker phone to get it to work. Everytime I make a call, I use the handset to dial and put it back on the speaker phone to talk. I was thinking about sending it back to the manufacture but after reading frustrated customers' review and what they experienced about the repair process makes me forget about it. In all, I would never ever recommend this model of the phone to any body."
1,Dead at one year,"This phone worked great for almost a year. Then as I talked, I would hear a crackling noise. Finally, the crackling noise became unbearable. Now when I search on the caller id, I get the message 'out of range'. I thought it was the battery going bad (it has a re-chargeable battery); however, when I replaced the battery, it did not improve. Don't buy this phone. The service is poor too. I left a voice mail and they never returned my call. I bet I have cost Panasonic at least 6 phone sales by word of mouth. I proud of it too. It would be morally reprehensible to let people enter into a buying decision on this phone without letting them know it is a terrible contraption."
1,Don't buy this phone!,"Unfortunately, I didn't read these reviews until after I bought this phone. My experience is the same as most of the reviewers. The phone is really bad. It has wonderful features and a great look, but it just doesn't work. After about 5 minutes on the phone I get this buzz that is so loud I can't hear the person I'm talking to. The buzz starts low and gradually gets worse. I've tried moving the base unit, unplugging appliances, messing with the antenna, and switching channels. All to no avail. I don't have a problem with the user interface, but that doesn't matter since the phone doesn't work."
1,VERY poor reception,"I purchased this phone a little over a year ago and, like other reviewers, as time went on the range dropped SIGNIFICANTLY. I've replaced the batteries multiple times and no luck. The problem appears to be signaling from the base to handset since everyone can hear me clearly but I can't understand a thing they are saying. Because of this problem, the caller ID only works 1/3 of the time (which makes me wonder why I'm paying $10/mo. for the feature). Also, you can't play messages from the answering machine while the handset is in use - very annoying.I got this phone to replace a Sony 900MHz DSS model that kept cooking the batteries. 3 years, two phones, and $400 down the drain. Don't get this phone."
1,Worst phone I have ever owned,"I bought this phone only 1 year ago , for alot of money, and now it won't even work. At first you would only get the ""out of range"" message every once in awhile and it would only last for a minute. It kept getting worse and worse until now the phone will not work. All you get is the ""out of range"" while standing inches from the base unit.Also the programing of the phone is confusing. I have read and re-read the manual I don't know how many times and I still can't get the time and date to work.This phone is the biggest waste of money. You're better of buying a cheap phone that at least you know will work."
2,Misses calls,"We've had Panasonic phones for awhile and have always been happy with them. This phone misses calls though: we'll pick it up and it'll take a moment to connect then say ""Out of range"" even though it's next to its handset.I've missed too many calls with this phone and I'm here now shopping for a new phone.I strongly would not recommend this telephone: especially at this price."
1,"Looks Good, Feels Good, But it doesn't work.","If you are looking for a phone that is feature rich, difficult to use and you only need it to work for a week or two then look no furthur.Like all the rest of the reviews, I have one and recently I was at a clients home who had one that works the same (it doesnt). They seem to work ok for about a month then the buzzing starts. It gradually gets worse to the point where you are out of range when you are standing right beside the base unit. The answering machine works but with no local dialing control to place outgoing calls it is just an answering machine. Do yourself a favour and buy another phone."
1,Don't Judge a Phone by its Looks,"I owned this phone. After three months the silver coating all over the phone started to peel and the printing on the face of the phone began to wear off. When I contacted Panasonic, they said this was caused by chemicals from my skin, i.e., makeup. I remarked there was not warning about using the phone while using makeup or having the phone come in touch with my skin. Ultimately, I am getting my full refund.The phone has other problems. Sometimes the screen doesn't work; I would get a message saying it was too far from the base when it was only 6"" away; the phone wouldn't work in front of my house when they claim it will work up to a mile away.It's difficult to hold and overall just a pain in the neck to use. It is clear and without interference, but that's a small plus considering all the minuses. Don't buy it!"
3,Not smartly designed,"Somehow I don't find this user friendly. The main reason being the functionality of Redial button. You need to select menu, then redial, and then talk to redial a number. Three buttons to redial? Who likes to do that?????Some other minor things that bothered me are the blue colored navigation button and the size of the TALK button. It is so confusing when you hang up the phone as you need to make sure you are disconnected.For this price they could have given a caller id on the base unit too! I am glad I did not pay to get this one. I had it as a gift."
1,Should they be sued for this product?,"It looks and feels good from outside. But this is the worst phone product I have ever had. Even worse than the 2 dollar phones you get at the local electronics shop. Don't be fooled with 2.4 Ghz thing. It sounds worse than my 15 year old cordless phone.What they say above is all true. I used this one for only a couple of months and it gave ""Out of Range"" signal. Its reception was getting worse and worse and finally died. We have another one at home. I tried the handset on it, which worked. So the problem was the actual recieving/transmitting machine which has the 2.4 chipset on it.The menu of the product is confusing and not smartly designed. You have a big blue button which should work miracles of OK/Exit/Menu/Up/Down/In/Out etc. Believe me, it is confusing.Reading from above comments, I feel like I should not send it back for repair, since they do not anyway. With so many complaints, I guess they should be sued or should recall this product."
1,Terrible product!,"I bought this phone just about one year ago and over the last month and a half have been experiencing heavy static and ""out of range messages"". I currently have the phone away from all electronic componets and have moved it around my place several times but the results have been the same. My last phone was a Sony cordless and I had it for over 3 years with no problems except for my roomate spilling water on it- bad luck. I'm shocked to see all of the similar issues with this phone and believe that Panasonic should be liable for a full refund- I will not waste my time on another Panasonic phone. Someone mentioned a class action lawsuit..it might be time to look into that option...."
3,Sad state of affairs:(,"Nobody, I repeat, nobody makes decent cordless home phones anymore. Here's just another example - ridiculous interface and control layout, completely weak and [poor] battery life, and a[insufficient] base unit that can't be used in parallel or as a main unit. My old Panasonic 900mhz had twice the battery life. My 10-channel Sony had better ergonomics.The redeeming highlights are: it's updated form factor with grippy elastomer holds, the all-weather ruggedness, the lighted buttons, 2-line display, and I actually like/use the clip once in a while. The actual range is relative to where you live and the surrounding structures - but can't I complain, it's clear a constant.The price is finally falling - so it's reasonable in comparison to other giga-hertz units. If somebody wants to go in on fronting a phone design firm- tell me and I'll consider pro bono work with the junk that's out there."
4,Good review for first time inquirers,"Excellent question and answer format that gives information on a wide variaty and range of bilble topics. Gives a good idea of what is happening in the field of scripture scholarship. However, one should understand this is the view of just one author and does not present all positions held on the topics discussed."
1,Noise/smoise!,"I bought this for my grandson, who is 13 and has trouble falling asleep. This didn't help him at all; he said it just sounds like a humming sound which is annoying. Actually, it bothers his sister, who is in another room."
4,Portable & Convenient,"After 6 years of walking my dog every day, I've found this to be my best option for cleanup. It's compact enough so I can carry it(by the handle) and an umbrela at once. The ""slot"" to load the roll of bags and the way they dispence is easy to use. Plus it opens wide enough to clean up after a 180lb dog with ease.I have two issues with it. The first one is the handle. I've gone thru 3 in the past 6 years just because the handle cracks and breaks. It could be me putting too much torque on the handle but I'm not sure. My other issue has nothing to do with the product itself but rather that this has become hard to find in a store. I don't know why that is so but I do know I've not found anything that works better for me."
3,2 Inches Too Short & Other Defect,"These collars are made two full inches too short. The 10"", which I bought, measure only 8 inches from the mid-buckle clasp to the furthest hole. I'm using these as ID tag straps for equipment and luggage, and I'm actually happy that they are much shorter than comparable pet collars. I can't find 8"" pet collars anymore. They are also somewhat defective because the stitched end that wraps around the buckle is wrapped the opposite way most ""normal"" pet collars are done, with the raw side on the outside of the collar. Again, compared with the other pet collars I've purchased, the raw side is so rough that you wouldn't actually want it rubbing against your pet's neck. But it is less attractive this way, to be sure, though it won't affect the performance of the collar. The blue is a nice intense sapphire blue, and the quality of the strap and buckle are otherwise fine."
5,Que falta hace reírse en tiempos difíciles,"como el actual...Y ESTOS CHISTES SON TAN PICANTES Y GRACIOSOS, QUE TE ALEJAN DEL PENSAMIENTO LA PERSPECTIVA DE LA GUERRA, de la pobreza y del desempleo..Y HASTA DE LOS PLEITOS CON TU MUJER !"
3,So Far..ehhh,"Well i have not shot my Ruger with this yet. It does not fit flush to the mags. There is a gap like it is high centered. I can make one edge touch but then the gap is wider on the other in. Some reviewers have written about gluing the corners, I had planned on doing this if i had the problems some people had written about. However with the high centered issue i can glue one side and leave the other wide? split the difference and not have a solid lock up at all? This will require a little modifications with the precision file set, oh will... will update when I'm done."
2,Will only deter amateur joyriders,"I had the Autolock engaged on the clutch pedal of a car with an alarm and starter disable. The next morning the Autolock was laying in the street where the car used to be. Had the Autolock been effective, it would not have been possible to push-start the car, which the thieves did.Purchase the Autolock ONLY as your weakest layer of security. A well-installed alarm, multiple kill switches, boot devices, etc. will do much more to help you keep your car."
4,Early Rice,"This album was from early on in Tony Rice's career. It has two really great tracks: Ginseng Sullivan and Blue Railroad Train; the rest is pretty standard bluegrass. Rice, of course, has a great singing voice."
3,Vancouver Guidebook,"It's not as thorough as Vancouver & Victoria for Dummies, but it added two or three additional bits of information to what I have learned so far. It's main emphasis is on restaurants/pricing and ""must see"" places...so these are good things to know."
2,Buyer Beware,"While you will experience stunning geographic photography, this DVD has little value. There are no captions identifying the buildings, landmarks, historic sites, or gardens, and this DVD is really just a photo travelog of unidentified locations accompanied by music of Tchaikovsky. There are no tracks dividing the works into movements so once you start, you're stuck with the entire piece. The failure to identify the places photographed limits the usefulness of this DVD."
1,Flimsy,"Bought this for carrying a GLOCK 30. Worst purchase I've made. The clip is large and the lip to hold it secure on the belt is small. On fast draw, the holster comes out with the gun. In a live situation, maximum threat, I'm dead! Last time I get one of these. Sticking with Blackhawk, don Hume, occidental or kidex."
4,Love the convenience!,I pick these up all the time at the store - great to be able to order online for a decent price.
4,great for cereal; too tart for eating out of the hand,"The raspberries are good in cereal, but too tart for eating out of the hand. But in cereal they're great!"
3,Invalid serial number?,"I encountered the same problem of the invalid serial number when installing this program. There are several ""l"" and ""I"" in my serial number which were shown in the font of arial, and it is impossible to tell they should be ""l"" or ""I"". Therefore, I tried several different conbination and finally worked. I also found, you cannot just change the serial number by re-entering a different letters; you have to click ""back"" and then enter the whole serial number. For those who may have the same problem, give it another shot! Good luck!"
4,A book for freelancers from a freelancer and editor,"This is a freelancer's book written by a former freelancer now editor. As such you get an insider's view on what is needed to be a successful freelancer. There aren't a lot of hints for improving your writing or picking subjects or any thing like that. The author assumes either you have the necessary ability and talent needed or you'll learn soon enough that you don't. Instead the focus is more on what to do to get in the door and stay inside. That is getting the attention of the editor and once you do get it how to keep it. I'll give you the main tip in two sentences. Do good work. Write what the editor asks for, write it well and write it on time. The author goes into more detail and explains more of how to do it. Not a bad investment if you're looking to get into freelancing. I give it a B+ on the StuPage Reviews."
2,Very bad quality,The quality of this Short Sleeve Polo is very bad. I was very disappointed by purchasing this.
1,Unwatchable!,"I cannot even rate ""Dance of the Drunk Mantis"" as a film. The subtitles are unreadable and the picture quality is terrible. It made for a baffling viewing experience. It might be worth it if you didn't need the subtitles. Maybe."
5,This One's from the Heart = James Darren,"This is a really excellent copilation of classic songs. Must with THE PROFESSIONAL QUALITY of James Darren. He manage to keep the mood and feeling of every song. Not adding any king of new 90's or 00's music style, just keeping the original concept. An excellent choice of GOOD MUSIC. By the way, I really did enjoy some of those songs in the TV series Deep Space Nine. MR. DARREN SHOULD RECORD ANOTHER CD WITH SIMILAR KIND OF SONGS, GOOD MUSIC LISTENERS WILL APPRECIATED!"
5,DS9 fans rejoice,"What it is: fun music, many of the songs having been performed in character on the show. James Darren's singing stands on its own, so those who enjoy the genre will love hearing the music, and those who loved seeing his character in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine will get a kick out of that fact all by itself.What it is not: Some folks have been disappointed that these are not the versions performed on the show. This is James Darren, not Vic Fontaine. The duets with other characters are not there. It was recorded as a separate effort from the show. I did not expect otherwise, but some folks did, so I thought I would mention it again."
4,Great performance,"I think I purchased this before Amazon was even founded and loved the CD. I don't remember the sound quality being as bad as some of the reviewers mentioned so I loaded the disc in my player and listened to it again. They have an excellent point. The orchestra sounds flat and lifeless (not their performance). I am not a recording engineer so I don't know if the problem was microphone placement, equipment quality, or just poor mixing but the orchestra just seems muffled. The piano sounds great and the performance by Horacio is my favorite so I still recommend it. Much better than a flawless recording of a terrible performance."
4,Handy Field Guide,"Of the several field guides to Indian birds, this is certainly one of the best researched, illustrated and sleekly designed books. The pictorial index in the inside cover page is brilliant and a great help for birders out in the field. Distribution maps are easy to locate and acurate.One would have liked to have a little more descriptive write ups on each bird, but the need to keep the size of the book manageable might perhaps have prompted the authers keep them short and sweet. However, due to the criptic and short descriptions in the book I find myself carrying two instead of one book in my backpack, Kazmierczak as a ready reference and Salim Ali for details.Illustrations are the best among all field guides available to date.Overall, a good and necessary addition to one's collection of bird books of Indian Region."
3,wonderful--but not a field guide,"The plates are delightful and the descriptions of habitat, song, geographical distribution etc are well done and accurate. However, what is needed is a FIELD guide! Why not base the book on Peterson guides and make it fit in the pocket. As it is you have to cut out the plates with a razor blade to make it into a field guide--or leave it at home. This is true for most bird guides, whether it be Costa Rica or Ecuador--or India. What we need is a book we can use in the field. Since 90% of birding is done with guides we do not need all the other stuff!!"
5,A good reference,"This is an invaluable reference work for anyone looking for information on the philanthropic world. However, there is 1 glaring omission: My brother, David G. Jacobs, is the Editor of this book, and is credited as such on the inside front cover. I don't know who this Jeffrey Falkenstein is, or why he is listed as ""compiler"". I felt I had to set the record straight on this item."
4,Cup of tea?,"I'm a long time coffee drinker but recently decided to switch to loose leaf tea. One of the items I needed to make this happen was a tea pot. Checked out various offerings on Amazon and decided on the SST (stainless steel teapot). It's a nice pot, holds twenty-eight ounces of liquid, more than enough for 4 six oz or 3 eight oz cups of tea. I find that I get a satisfying cup of tea using Rishi Earl Grey, three tea spoons to a pot with a four minute brew. The pot doesn't keep the tea as warm for as long as I'd like but that's what a microwave is for. The included tea basket works great. The handle is a bit awkward but all in all a good selection. If you like the look of stainless then you can't go wrong with the SST."
1,Don't Waste Your Money and Time !,"I bought a book based on recommendations above and I can't describe how deeply disappointed I was. This pamphlet (not even a book) and video DO NOT WORTH the money it cost: absolutely basic information for dummies. The pamphlet/video can be summarized in one sentence: Eat right, don't drink, don't smoke, take your vitamins and exercise. Who doesn't know that! All this information can be easily found on Internet for FREE."
1,Pathetic,"Unbelievably horrible. Pathetic. Moronic. These are the only words that I can use to describe Dimitri Gutas' book. The book is supposedly for specialists in the field, but Gutas is not a Near Eastern Studies specialist, so he is not qualified as an author. Seek out other authors for a scholarly account of the Graeco-Arabic translation movement.As for this book: Tear it to shreds. Throw it in a swimming pool and leave it to drown. Bury it under ground. It doesn't deserve to be published or read by anyone. Absolutely dreadful. Ridiculous. Hateful. Dimitri Gutas is the poorest excuse for an author and a scholar."
4,I will definitely remember this book!,"This book was on my bookshelf for at least 6 months before I actually picked it up and began reading... once I opened to page one, I couldn't put it down until I had read the very last word. I definitely recommend this book - it will make you smile & make you cry, sometimes at the same time!"
5,Good Book,This kept me reading far to long into the night. Lots of twists and turns. All Archer Mayor's Joe Gunther books are just great.
4,Scent of Evil,Love Joe Gunther. I put him with the likes of Alex Cross.I am now reading the fourth Joe Gunther book and loving it. Keep up the good work
3,Not as good as the others...,"This book, was a disapointment to me. When I first began reading it I thought it would get better. It didn't. I liked the idea of reading about a girl who helps take care of a lighthouse (especially during the Civil War which happens to be my fave period in American History) but the idea of her parents breaking up I didn't like. Divorce didn't happen very often back then...why did Miss Hesse have to put it into a book?"
4,Voltron Beast King Golion Complete,This was given as a gift and it was enjoyed very much. This tells more of the complete story. This showed that it was a lot more darker than the original version that came out back then. I would highly recommend this to fans of the show and those who are looking for something different.
5,ZACK ATTACK!!,"This is by far one of the best albums I have heard in years!It starts out great and ends great. Not one single filler as far asI am concerned. Zack is my new insperation to pick up my guitar andstart playing again. His style of playing and writing is about asclose to perfection as you can get! Super clean,heavy,loud,crunchy,melodic,you name it Zack has got it!"
5,a Great BLS album,sorry to all those people who don't see real talent some of the metalheads who only like the music when u can't understand the lyrics and enjoy someone throwing up into a microphone this album isn't for you but if u like a nice solid album with some heavy tracks mixed with some good ballads buy this album it is solid all around
2,Wow,This album can be compared to the genius of Saint Anger by Metallica with more cowbell!! It reminds me of November Rain from Guns and Roses if Steven Adler had still been in the band and was alowed to sing.You must OWN this CD.I wish I had more thumbs to express my feelings for this musical.
2,An Okay Fan,"The fan is powerful.But, I don't like the swivel head. It's not attatched firmly to the stand, so it can be twisted by hand easily. Also, assembly of the fan and fan cover was annoying. The fan cover comes off sometimes. And be careful of those blades (stainless steel)! You can loose a finger!"
3,must read for community builders,"The thing I like about this book is its practical and positive orientation about giving voice to one's own set of talents and how this contributes towards community building. The whole orientation of its philosophy is so commonsensical one gets struck that one never thought about talents and skills that way. Nonetheless, this positive orientation seems to take a one-sided approach that diminishes the totally real reality of weakness and failures (or probably that's just me being rather cynical!). Also, the online-assessment is a very good one, although the fact that one has to buy a book to get a one-time, one person access code seems to be motivated more by marketing ideals, rather than pure good intention of helping out people discover themselves. All in all, it's a must read for serious community builders and church leaders."
3,Be careful if you buy this used,"I had to get this book for a class and ordered it used. Unknown to me, this book has an associated online assessment that has an access code. Each book has a unique access code and can only be used once. I was unable to take the quiz and that is a large part of what this book is about. Buy this book new if you want to get the full benefits."
2,Useless Without the Assessment,"LikeNow, Discover Your Strengths, this book is not really a stand-alone book but essentially the second part of a two-part process:(1) taking the online strengths assessment and (2) using the book to interpret the results. Clearly, without the first half, you get little use out of the second.But the code only works once! Unless you buy this book brand new, it will do you no good since you can't take the test. If you did buy it new and loved it, you can't pass it on to friends either because they won't be able to take the test!Also, if you buyNow, Discover Your Strengthsand use it well you probably won't need this book. It largely translates what you learned in the first book into church- specific opportunities. Common sense and a little creativity should fill in most of this information for you if you really understood it the first time around."
3,So now what?,"Because the book describes each of the many different talents, it does not get into depth with any of them. It is a helpful basic resource, but I was hoping for more."
3,Inadequate to pass the exam,"From page one, critical mistakes all over the book that force the user to not only question whether the entire contents are accurate but whether the author even has a CNE yet a CNA. The book doesn't follow the course objectives nor does it even mention them in the book. The practice tests have misprints and some of the answers are out-right wrong. It scares me to think that the editor is as popular as the book claims. These people are out to make a buck and did from me, but that won't happen again."
4,A Dam! Good Documentry,"~This documentry is an exellent pice of work like the book of the same title which i read while i was at college. The movie discusses the old movie system and how it was brought in to the 20th century, by a few directors such as Scorsese, Coppola, Peckinpah, Beaty, Penn and Denis Hopper. It shows how the directors like penn were influenced by french directors like Trafut etc. but what makes the film so good to watch is the interviews from the directors themselves. I would have liked a little more~~ information on Sam Peckinpah & John Cassevttes that would have given the movie 5 stars in my opinion.~"
4,Gorgeous Charm - Amazing Price!,"Amazing find! The charm is as adorable in person! Out of this world pricing! I was a little concerned about using it on a charm bracelett, as it seems a little dainty. Alas the gal who's present it was, was not concerned about that at all!Way to go!"
5,Rachmaninoff's Vespers w/ Shaw,"I just heard this work for the first time this afternoon on my local classical music station KUAT in Tucson. It was simply enchanting. A capella. Over an hour of beautiful sacred music, the Vespers (or All Night Vigil) is part of the liturgy of Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican communions. This work by Rachmaninoff has a slightly Russian sound but is still a modern work of about 1915. It is simply sublime."
1,Did Maestro Shaw read music ?,Never before in my life have I witnessed such a blatant disregard for the written score. This recording SUCKS
1,Absolute Filth !,For a truly fantastic reading of the Rachmaninov Vespers check out the Polyansky recording on Melodiya.
1,BEWARE MADE IN AL-QAEDA!!!,"I buy this for my nephew he charged the psp for second time and the charger exploded! thanks God he was far away. one friend of mine look the charger and he said that he bought the same one and it did the same on him it EXPLODED!! just beware, don't buy it, not recommended!! ""at least that you want to use it on July 4th"""
5,LOVE IT!,I bought this because I had a kettle of water on my stove for probably two hours in the morning.I thought of the propane I was wasting. It also took forever for water to boil. This french presshas boiling water so fast that I know now not to leave the kitchen. I love it.
5,Love it!!!,This is the best French press I have ever owned. I onl write reviews when I really feel strongly about something and this product is AWESOME!!! Priced as much as a plain old French press for sale at Starbucks (yuck) you would be a fool not to get this.
2,Loved it until it broke,"My wife and I used this press 1-2 times per day for about 9 months and loved it -- and then the base began to leak.An incredible convenience (boiling in the same pot as pressing), but we are back to our standard glass press until a new version of the product is released.Especially disappointing at the price."
5,Yo,"I have a bunch of guitars so buying a strap for each one would be very costly. I looked at many guitar straps and was blown away by the prices of them except this strap. Who needs a strap that would lift a car? So I decided to get a couple of the Earie Ball straps. They are great and I can use them on any stringed instrument that allows for a guitar strap. I just put one on my baritone uke and although a bit wide for that instrument it feels great. The material is not as thick as some of the straps I have but again, I don't plan on using it to tow a car. If you want to use it on your vintage Gibson it might not look as good as the guitar but it would be functional. For daily use on my guitars this strap is ideal. The price sold me and the quality is better than the price. I will get more of these for my other guitars."
5,Great strap for your money,"Great strap for your money. Can't go wrong with this. I was searching all over the net. Found things like the Levi straps, Comfort Strapp, Planet Waves, etc. Well you know what, unless you play in a gig for 4+ hours, this will do. If you're a pro pro, go for those other expensive ones. If you're just playing at home or with friends, get this. Get value for the money!"
5,Ernie Ball Guitar Strap,"I ordered this guitar strap for my son, as a late Christmas gift, but the shipping was so fast I received it in time for Christmas. He's very happy with it. The strap is exactly as described."
1,terrible costume,"Don't be fooled by the picture! First off, this is the least sexy thing one could possibly wear--it's like velvet footie pajamas for children. Secondly, it's not purple, it's bright blue. It also runs very short. At 5'6 it was easily 5"" too short for me to wear. Last but not least, the mask is ill-fitting, wildly uncomfortable, and utterly unwearable. SKIP IT!"
1,eh...,"im 5'5 and about 120lbs with long legs. I got a medium but shouldve DEFINITELY gotten a large. I put this on and was uncomfortable because the length wasnt right and i bent over and ripped it, not to mention made of awful material even for a halloween costume. Oh well waste of money. It was cute from the waste up though lol"
5,Loved it!!!!,THis book is GREAT i absoulutely LOVED IT. I couldn't put it down. I lost sleep. OMG it is SO good!!!!!!
5,Great performance by Telarc,I do not agree with the previous reviewer comment about the technical quality of the Telarc recording. Technically and artistically this is an outstanding release as are the other Mozart Symphonies by Mackerras on Telarc. I have most but not all of them.
1,Not for the ameteur,"Total emphasis on artsy manipulation of images. No practical use for someone just getting started. Maybe for a pro with an established business, models, and clients this book can provide inspiration but for a private individual this book is of absolutely no value."
2,Technology is great.,"This battery is quite possibly the single most annoying device I have ever encountered.....the lights seem to flash at the most inopportune times for no apparent reason. Quite a feature. I guess it does keep a decent charge, though. And it was on sale. And I put some duct tape over it."
5,Not Dohnanyi but Morris,"Very nice review from Ryan Richards ""reb77"". There is one problem though. The version that is being sold above is not the one by Dohnanyi and the Cleveland Orchestra, but a version by Wyn Morris and the London Symphony Orchestra. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by this interpretation of both symphonies. They are pretty starightforward in terms of tempos and dynamics. There is not much really that can be varied on Beethoven's symphonies. There is such an amount of different versions that for a director going out of the framework that already exists for Beethoven would be disastrous. The recording in this album is from 2003 and very good. I asume that must be either ADD or DDD; clean and very powerful dynamic variations. I recommend this album. A very good price-value recording."
5,The Revealer,I brought this book for a seminary class but after I read it I had to buy a few more as gifts to other ministers. Lea & Black not only revealed some good background information for biblical students but provided information which I often use to help me in my sermons and personal studies. I highly recommend this book to anyone who feel the need to look behind the scriptures.
4,"So far, so good!",I've wanted a pizzelle maker for a long time and thought the reviews and price on this maker seemed the best. I've used it once so far (the recipe in the book made over 100 pizzelles) and it seemed to work great. They tasted great. Jen
4,Bakes well; difficult to make pizzelles look pretty,"I bought this maker because I really wanted to be able to make a unique type of cookie to give as Christmas gifts. The machine bakes well and the recipes in the small cookbook that came with it are tasty. It's frustrating, though, that I can't get the pizzelles to come out consistently round. The kit really needs to include some sort of dispenser (like a squeeze bottle or pastry bag) that can measure out the exact amount of batter needed for each pizzelle. They do include a very tiny plastic spoon, but this does not work well, especially because the batter is so sticky. I use my own cake-decorating pastry bag to more carefully measure out the batter for each pizzelle. This still isn't the best option, but it does help. Also, a note that the metal on the outside of the unit gets VERY HOT. Too bad the company couldn't have come up with a cooler outside for the baker."
2,Too Small,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. She made pizzelles years ago and was initially thrilled. But when she saw the small size of the cookies, her disappointment was clear. We never even plugged it in. I don't disputed the performance other reviewers claimed. But, we got the Villaware pizzelle iron instead and found this traditional size better suited to both standard cookies as well as filled cookies, ice cream cups, etc. that my wife likes to make. It also cooks faster than the Chef's Choice literature claims.Before you buy, be sure you realize how small the cookies this iron makes are. They just aren't suitable for some traditional pizzelle uses"
4,Impressed,"First, I was impressed at how fast I received it. It works very well and I enjoy making different flavors."
1,thick pizzelles,really didn't like it.. I'm sending it back.. makes the pizzelles too thick. you can't squeeze it to thin out the cookies.
5,Great Book,"This book was very good. I really enjoyed reading it because it had me guessing every step of the way. This book was alot better than the last warriors book she wrote,this Warriors New Prophecy had alot more action in it than the last book. The only part I would have changed is that Stormfur went with his friends when they left The Tribe of Rushing Water,but overall it was a wonderful book.:3 ;3 :3 ;3 :3 ;3 :3 ;3 :3 ;3 :3 ;3 :3 ;3 :3 ;3 :3"
3,"Warriors, NP: Dawn","Nice how the Clans could come together, and not rip each others throat out.My fave bit would have to be when Crowpaw/feather said he wasn't afraid of dying because Feathertail would be waiting for him.Kind of longish, but still good."
3,Ok book,I still think the books before THE NEW PROPHECY series were betterbut if you had read those read the others THE NEW PROPHECY 4 could be super good! We should see it from Firestar's point of view again.Why does the cool cats have to die. Is all of river clan going to die? That is a wild guess!
4,I agree,"I agree with the review above, but if it is a book from the second series, wouldn't it say (The New Prophecy) somewhere? And based on the age it is for, it saounds like a book from the first series. It really bugs me that it isn't out yet, becouse it says June 05. It could be a misprint though. It shouldn't even be on the market yet anyway. At least not until Moonrise is out. I'm so excited! I can't wait to see what happens! I wonder where all the clans will go. What a big change!"
3,Irwin 10 180T blade,"The blade did not provide a clean cut on .25 thick plexiglass, rapidly lost sharpness . Required lubrication on blade to prevent seizing of motor. Plastic melted without it. Price was reasonable"
2,too rudimentary,"I only recommend this book if you are an absolute beginner to yoga and aren't looking for a lot of a lot of detailed information on various types of knee injuries. Although I got a couple of helpful tidbits from this book, it wasn't particularly useful for me as an intermediate yoga student. I'd been practicing yoga for about a year, when I dislocated my knee doing cow face pose. Since I'd dislocated my knee several times as a teenager, I wanted to avoid another injury. I was hoping for tips on how to safely ease into lotus, but the author doesn't even mention lotus pose. I was also hoping for definitive answers on which poses to avoid (I still don't know whether I can safely do reclining hero pose). Some instruction on bracing or taping techniques would have been helpful, but there is nothing like that in this book. Overall, the info isn't very specific and the poses offered may be too easy for some people."
5,This book is incredibly helpful,"Sandy Blaine's book is great. I've used it to help my knees and it's been a huge help. It's clear and thourough, I highly recommend it."
1,Might be good if dvd was actually in box,Ordered three items and received them within a couple days. I opened up the package still wrapped in plastic and no dvd was inside.
2,Works but wish the D700 was like my D70 with this builtin,"I was disappointed from before ordering this product.. Its a much needed product for me but the one that was on the D70s was smaller, much cheaper, and no extra modules on the camera was needed. I could even use my pda's infrared to activate it. I could keep the remote in my pocket and quickly use it anytime it was needed. The D700 I have to plug in the module and use a much larger remote and there are a bunch of other switches on it that I'll most likely never use. Also, if I want to use my SB600 speedlight I need the extra mount or dangle it over the side. Not good considering the D700 is considered high-end consumer camera versus the low end D70s"
4,pretty good buy,I got two of these for my boys for christmas and so far so good. My 2 1/2 year old still cant reach the pedels but i guess he will grow into it. I got a diffrent looking bag then the one displayed but it still works. Over all a good buy for $[...]!!
4,Djembe head,"The head arrived in good condition and in a good time frame. It's a little frustrating how tight the head originally is, which makes seating it on the djembe that much more difficult, but that's the way it is."
2,Works great but not for long :(,"Bought this router on Nov 07, unfortunately it stopped working.Had to return it due to Internet Access failure, the DNS wouldn't recognize any web addresses. I reset the router and still wouldnt work, I setup a static DNS server and didn't work, then updated the firmware and setup again and still didn't work.Pros: Easy to configure with assistant*, excellent range (about 40 feet tested), good speed on wireless G.Cons: Very hard to configure the encription type (WAP & WEP), when rebooting takes some time to gain access to Internet again, rarely but it did lose its connection."
4,PSOne car adaptor,"THE CAR ADAPTOR IS ONE OF THE GREATEST THING INVENTED FOR THE PSONE,I KNOW SINCE MY FRIEND HAS IT, BUT I NEED TO KNOW IF IT ALSO WORKS FO THE PLAYSTATION 2."
3,Hits the points.,"As the war on Iraq and other decisions were made in the past are being un-raveled in time, this book illustrates the clear examples of how the current president is blinding all the trusted individuals of the nation.You should read this book to get a better understanding of how the Buah family are lying and taking control with lies and deceipts."
3,Cheap belt,"If you need a cheap belt in a pinch to just wear a few times this would be good, it did not hold up to daily wear for too long and it started to pull apart."
2,I agree that it is not terribly helpful for non-MBAs.,"The only thing this book succeeded in doing was turning me off about getting an MBA. As a software developer, I would have thought my background in mathematics would have been sufficient to understand a supposed-overview of accounting, finance, and economics topics, but I found these chapters dry and they seemed to simply present a great deal of equations that made little sense out of context.I may still go for an MBA someday, but this book did little to prepare me, tide me over in the meantime, or excite me about the possibility of mastering the topics."
4,A Very Good Read,"This book is organized in ten chapters, one for each day:1 - Marketing2 - Ethics3 - Accounting4 - Organizational Behavior5 - Quantitative Analysis6 - Finance7 - Operations8 - Economics9 - Strategy10 - MBA MinicoursesThe style of author makes it very easy to read and to understand. The goal of the book is not to give detailed in-depth knowledge about each topic, but the same holds true in a regular MBA. The main goal is to introduce the basic concepts and to make the reader aware of them. In real life, one has always to be able to research and study in detail some areas as needed.I have considered for some time to enroll in a MBA. The greatest value I see in it, is the networking with other colleagues with different backgrounds and different experiences.If you can not afford the time and the money, I strongly recommend you this book."
2,what a price,"I actually saw this toy in a toy store and purchased it for my 4 year old, he played with it for maybe 15 minutes then clipped it to his backpack and I haven't heard it since.... also a note on the price,... the price listed on here is SO not worth the money they're asking."
3,Decent backup wallet,"I have owned this wallet for about 6 monthsOn the positive side for the price this is decent leather and the stitching has stayed pretty solid even through normal wear and tearthere were some minor stains on it when I received it but figured it was not worth the trouble of returning it.After using this for a month the wallet starts to look dingy and will start getting a yellow tint and the design will start to fade quickly.This is a decent backup wallet, like an old pair of sneakers that got to be a little ugly over time but are still very comfortable"
5,Great Product!,"Just a great as I had expected! Runs perfect and really cools down our entire home, upstairs and down!Thank you!"
2,LOUD,"The fan was shipped and arrived very quickly, which was a pleasant surprise. BUT, the fan itself is very loud and doesn't seem to move much air. When placed on the LOW setting it has a very annoying high pitched hum. When on the HIGH position it sounds like it could refresh the air in the room within seconds, but actually moves very little air. I would suggest a different brand - it's bark is much bigger than it's bite for sure."
5,Nice looking & effective fan,"Very happy with these fans. Purchased one from a CVS nearly 5 years ago and it is still working perfectly. Purchased 2 more from Amazon, and am still very pleased with these fans performance. Love how quiet they are, the general aesthetic, and the fan speed adjustment + ""thermostat"".These also work very well in windows that slide open horizontally instead of vertically. Extra solid segments can be purchased at a fairly reasonable price from Honeywell, but we warned that they are only half length.I have also had no issues with these windows malfunctioning in rain or allowing extra rain to come in through the window."
5,Exactly as described.,"Beautiful rug for a small space - I have it at the front door. Quality at a good price. Arrived quickly, would recommend."
1,Laser pointer/PDA stylus,"Laser pointer works, but can't get the pen tips to come out without taking the pen apart. Will never buy this again."
5,The finest performance I've heard.,"Horacio Gutierrez has a special ability to give beautiful performances of the big virtuoso piano concertos of the Romantic era. Although his virtuosity is staggering, it is matched by his artistic sensitivity. His performance of Brahms Piano Concerto No. 2 is simply gorgeous, surpassing every other performance I've ever heard -- including the legendary performance by Serkin and Szell. I beg you to get this superb recording."
5,Really Helpful,I loved this book. It told me things I'd never heard and convinced me that eating right was a damn good idea.
1,Basically Vegan Diet.,"I heard Dr. Fuhrman on the radio first. While he seems to be knowledgeable, I found this book pretty useless. His Diet is essentially a vegan diet. It is much better than Atkin's diet of course. But like Atkins, Dr. Fuhrman's diet would be a difficult diet to maintain for a long period of time.On a related note, his website is too commercial. In general, my opinion is that if a physician or anyone for that matter truly care and passionate about the well being of fellow human beings, why can't they make that information free on his/her website. Publishing book is fine but many leading diet specialists make it a commercial..too commercial."
5,"Not just a diet book, it's a how to book for healthy eating!","This nutritional diet is based on solid scientific research, it's not a fad diet. It is about living a life that is healthy and disease free. Dr. Fuhrman is a real life practicing physician who is truly interested in helping people get healthy (which will also result in weight loss if overweight). This diet not only prevents heart disease and diabetes but will reverse it. I highly recommend this book to my family and friends!"
4,Add soluble fiber to the mix,"While I've pored over, studied, and largely implemented Dr. Fuhrman's excellent EAT TO LIVE, I'd like to warn the reader of a seemingly overlooked gap: the role of soluble fiber. So, before you go chowing down on those salads with umpteen veggies, be sure to supplement this huge quantity of insoluble fiber with the soluble kind. Otherwise your salad and veggies just wash through you; you'll find it very uncomfortable and it will impede your daily life.So be sure to supplement your healthy new diet with enough soluble fiber, including apples (peeled), applesauce, soy/tofu, oats, dried beans and peas, carrots, and, of course, psyllium. Rice, barley, and bread also seem to help."
2,Eat Your Veggies,I am all for eating fruits and vegetables and this book has some great information. My only complaint was that the menus and weekly meal plans did not contain any food I would eat. Give up dairy? I need it for my osteoporis....I know I can get calcium from other foods...but got to have milk.I found the advice of the book to restrictive.
4,Sound advice for eating right.,"I found this book to be full of great practical information for improving your health. Dr. Fuhrman is right on when it comes to the American Diet. I do feel that he pushes abstinence from meat a bit too far as a small amount of meat is good for you. He does admit this in his book, but one is left with the impression that any meat is bad for you, and he pushes the vegan diet all the way. Other than that it is a great book. I have started improving my diet by following closely, not strictly, his diet, and I am losing weight (ca. 7 lbs.)and feeling much better after only 2 weeks! Thank you Dr. Fuhrman for the ""practical"" advice and the recipes in the book."
2,Be very careful if you have IB,"I bought and read the book in January at the urging of my doctor, and then gave it a try. I love vegetables and fruit, but 2 pounds a day exasperated my irritable bowel symptoms and I needed to quit. I also hate cooking and food prep, which this eating style pretty much demands if you want any variety at all. Maybe I should have modified things a bit, but I gave the book away."
5,Commit! Commit! Celebrate!,"I am buying Dr. Fuhrman's book for everyone I love. As a patient of Dr. Joel Fuhrman, I am living proof that making a six week commitment to his program yields incredible results! With this knowledgeable coach and cheerleader, I reversed diabetes, improved cholesterol levels and triglicerides; I am now a slim size 6 once again; and I have more energy than ever. You owe it to yourself to read Dr. Fuhrman's book if you want to live a healthy life and learn how to eat properly."
5,They should be teaching this in medical schools!,"As a physician who graduated from medical school recently, I really wish we would have been taught to better educate our patients about how much their diets can affect their daily health. We really did not get the training in proper nutrition ourselves. Basically, we learned what diets to write for an inpatient non-diabetic, a diabetic inpatient, a cardiac inpatient, and morbidly obese inpatients. If such a diet as is described in this book was presented to us, we may have been pushing this to patients instead of pushing meds as the only option for improving hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. I'm a strong advocate of meds as long as they are prescribed responsibly. If this diet can reduce the number of meds a patient is on, so much the better. This is a great book and I'm trying to work at incorporating more fruits and veggies and cutting out animal meats from my diet. Thanks Dr. Fuhrman!"
5,"Not a diet, but a healthy way of living","I bought this book and was not a vegetarian or vegan. I have lost 20+ lbs in the first six weeks, but more importantly I feel better than ever. I know it is a pretty rigid plan, but if it helps you change any of your bad habits, it is worth it.If you strictly adhere to the plan for six weeks, you will have a diffeent perspective on eating. I do not plan to stay vegan, but I do think I will eat vegan most of my meals from now on."
2,A little more truth in advertising would have helped...,"I can summarize this weight loss plan simply: become a vegan. Not a vegetarian, mind you, but a no dairy, no eggs, no kiddin' vegan. To be fair, the author does offer a ""Seven Day Plan"" for non-vegetarians but that is little more than a concession on his part. The narrative of the book says that the only way to really live an optimally healthy life is to become a vegan.I have no problem with people who are or want to become vegans. Furthermore, I have no doubt that I would lose weight like a conventioneer loses money at Caesar's Palace on this diet. I, myself, just don't want to eat a pound of kale every day for the rest of my life. Or bok choy. Or rapini. I wish I did. I just don't. If you do, this is the diet book for you."
2,eat to live is okay for wabbits,"i only gave this a low rating because i cannot imagine eating like this!great food plan... if you can hack it. . . i'll be doing weight watchers, thank you!!!"
3,LOUD!!!,"Way too loud for such a small fan. Also, has an awkward mechanism when it oscillates. Has a catch when it gets all the way to one side and the motor slows down."
4,Damien Rice,"This cd is missing a lovely song by Damien Rice, called 'delicate'. In the movie it plays during the beach scene where Frankie is attempting to skip rocks.Just thought i would share this piece of information."
4,Nice mix of score and soundtrack,"This album is nice because it has all the score music along with all the other music played in the movie on one CD. The ""Dear Frankie Main Title"" is especially nice to have. I bought this CD for my sister for Christmas, but now the whole family wants to listen to it. I would recommend it for anyone that liked the movie!"
5,Dear Frankie- CD,I liked the music in the movie so much that I bought the CD and was not disappointed at all. It's wonderful and I listen to it constantly.
1,Fire Hazard,"Within hours of plugging in this fridge, the power unit overheated and melted! We're fortunate my son's bedroom didn't start on fire. It cooled drinks and food quickly, but the outside of the fridge was very warm. I thought the fan was loud, but it didn't bother my son. TRU said they didn't have any complaints or returns on this fridge."
1,Piece of Junk,"We bought this fridge and the powersupply burned up after two weeks. We also had purchased the extended warranty on it from Toys R us, but everytime we tried to register it, the warranty website kept saying page not found. After it broke and Toys R Us wouldn't take it back, we ended up being out both the money for the junky fridge and the warranty. We can't even file a claim to have it replaced because we could never register the warranty. Don't buy this fridge!"
5,Ben Franklin Reader,"This is an interesting book and Benjamin Franklin was an amazing man. Walter Isaacson's book ""An American Life"" was much easier to read. This book is Franklin's actual writings and while he was clever and brilliant it is hard for me to really follow his text."
3,"well built, but....","This a well built product and is well worth the money, but my dad and I have been playing paper football for years and didnt know what to expect. A paper football has much less drag and slides freely across the table. Although the leather Fiki Football seems very durable, it is not flat and therefore wobbles when you play and it doesnt glide across the table very easily. Maybe we will try to get used to it instead."
3,Denominational bias abounds,"I found that this book was good at answering some standard questions but forced answers for truly difficult sayings of Jesus. Some of the answers given I felt were lacking and unclear. The author appeared to have a specific denominational mindset that closed off the answers that were quite simple from a different angle. The ""difficult"" in the title appeared to be relative based on a person's denominational preference and closed mindedness."
4,My niece loved it,I purchased this for Christmas day entertainment. It's nice to have some wholesome offerings for youngsters. My niece loved it - the Strawberry scent on the packaging is very clever. Good purchase.
5,In Lithuanian Woodcut,"All readers who love good, sensible writing will enjoy this book. No trickery or multisyllabic mumbo-jumbo. No jibber-jabber. Highly recommended."
1,El autor no es psicólogo,"Sólo quiero hacer una acotación al comentario que aparece en líneas arriba respecto a que el autor es un psicólogo prominente.El autor no es psicólogo, y mucho menos ejerce dando terapia. El autor tiene como profesión únicamente la de escritor.Me parece una irresponsabilidad señalar al autor como un psicólogo prominente."
5,"¡Parece leyenda, pero con las técnicas","de este libro, conquisté a mi adorable esposa !Y se lo voy a pasar a mis hijos varones, porque vale oro como EL MANUAL DE LA CONQUISTA DE LA MUJER !"
2,wears out quickly,"It worked well for a little while, but over a few weeks the motor got weaker and louder. Now its just really loud and doesn't push air. I plan on returning it."
3,good blower,"It does circulate a lot of air and keep me cool.I like this feature. But it sounds like a jet engine,just matches its name--blizzard.I dare not set it on high or even medium,because I am afraid of waking up my roommate adjoining."
2,Way too loud,"A table fan should be felt and not heard.A little sound from the whirring of blades can be comforting. Motor noise, on the other hand, is very different, very unpleasant, and actually quite unnecessary. Whether it is the motor on a $10 product or a $1,000 product, manufacturers seem to have an aversion to putting a little inexpensive vibration/sound absorbing material around the motor housing. Go figure.I do have one tabletop air circulator (Vornado) that is tolerable on the lowest speed thanks to a square of egg crate foam I set it on - a little fan whirring but almost no motor noise."
2,It is too loud,"The title of my review says it all. If you do not wish to hear anything else in the room, the fan works well."
1,doesn't work,I ordered three of these fans. Two of them made incredibly loud squeeking noises and didn't blow out any air at all. The third one worked for about a week and then died. Don't waste your money.
1,not worth the money,"I bought this last summer and it has had about 5 minutes of use total. My 5 year old is too heavy for it (it doesn't give him any bounce) and my 2 year old can't touch the ground when he sits on it. Seem that only a very thin, tall child would be able to use it and find it at all entertaining."
2,Big disappointment with big potential,"Since his 2nd birthday jumping is my son's favorite pastime, so I thought that this would be an ideal addition to our jump-o-lene. I was thrilled with our purchase as winter is fast approaching in the Midwest and I am always looking for ways for my little guy to burn excess energy indoors. Sure, I read all of the reviews with the complaints and quite frankly, I thought they were a bunch of whiners. Having lived through the experience, I cannot emphasize how long it takes to funnel through sand (especially damp sand) into the little hole. After hours of working the sand through the hole my son spent about 3 minutes on the ride. I think that Little Tikes underestimated the ages for this toy and now we have a huge, heavy paperweight in the middle of our play room. My son is on the 90th percentile for his age for height, but he can barely tough his tip toes to the floor, so any serious bouncing won't be possible for months. Someday he'll love it!"
1,Not worth the time or the money,"My mother purchased this toy for my two-year-old for Christmas, and, just as in the other reviews I've read, we spent hours setting it up only to have my daughter sit on it for about two minutes. My daughter {who is big for her age at 31 pounds) cannot make the thing bounce or whirl. Her feet do not reach the ground when she sits on it. It is now in the middle of our yard collecting dirt {on the ball}-- I'm waiting to see if she will grow into it, but I'm doubtful. At her birthday party a few months ago, I watched some of the older kids playing in the yard, and even the four-year-olds got bored on it fast.I'm very glad we didn't spend the money on it, but I wish mom had read the reviews before wasting her money on this one."
2,how to get sand in the toy,"i bought this at a thrift store for $10 so i didn't waste much on it thank goodness. my daughter only walks in a circle pushing the seat around. she'll bounce on it every once in a while but gets bored with it in about 5 minutes.a tip on getting the sand through the hole. most play sand is wet or at least damp when you buy it, so put the sand in something or just dump it on the porch in the sun for a day or two till it dries. cut a two liter plastic pop bottle in half and put the opening of the bottle in the hole of the toy then just pour the dried sand in with a cup or little shovel. cuts fill time to just a few headache-free minutes. my toy already had sand in it since i bought used, but i used this method on an umbrella stand i recently bought.hope this helps"
1,whirlybouncer rider,"My kids did not enjoy this product at all. It did not bounce and whirl. my kids were tired and bored on it they did not stay on it long because they had to push and work very hard for it to bounce at all for them to have a little enjoyment out of it. the item does not go high they have to use there legs to do all the work i give this product a thumbs down, and alot of my friends bought this for their children and they all said the same thing."
1,Disappointed,The picture gives the impression that your child can spring and float fairly easily around in a circle...like a teeter tater on a merry go round...that is not what it does. My 4 year old can barely bounce on it and my 2 year old is on her tip toes to try and bounce. I'm not sure what the design of this was for...but it was misleading. It was expensive so I would think about it before purchasing.
5,Too Big For Most,"It's going to take a fairly intelligent person to fully understand this book to its full potential. There is a lot going on here and even more to criticize. But that's what makes it so great; its complete honesty. It's interesting to see how this man's mind works and how he deals with the world around him.I don't believe it's a book to agree or disagree with but just to ""watch"". Only a pretty bright person can really relate to his base ""you have to be alone to really create something worthwhile"" attitude.I think for most people this book will be an all or nothing experience."
3,really A 3.5,"I ENJOYED THIS BOOK BUT, DARN IT I FIGURED OUT THE BAD GUY VERY EARLY WHAT I DID NOT KNOW WAS HOW HE PULLED IT OFF THIS WA A GOOD BOOK A STEP OR 2 ABOVE THE BASIC MYSTERY I GUESS I DID NOT LIKE THE ROMANCE END OF IT BUT, IT HAD TO BE THERE"
5,great mystery!,"This was one of the free kindle downloads Amazon offers, and I have to say I would absolutely have paid for this book. Really enjoyed the story. Will definitely check out next book in the series."
1,Couldn't get past the 3rd chapter,"Downloaded this based on the reviews, but the writing was so bad I had to stop reading. The author uses overly descriptive sentences for nearly everything and thoughts seem to change mid-paragraph. It jumped around so much from sentence to sentene I finally had to quit. Wish I could say better - but this one just couldn't keep me reading and it's very rare for me to not finish a book I've started."
1,Deadly Sanctuary,"If you are a 16 year old teenage girl, you may enjoy this book. I had to stop reading half way through I was so disenchanted. Poor writing skills, tedious plot and unlikable characters."
5,Creepy blend of spooky psycho-thriller and whodunit.,The author writes knowledgeably and well. She knows how to weave a complicated tale. She is a good mystery writer and has evidently done her homework. She knows her craft. (I'm a writer myself and that's important to me.) I recommend it highly as plain old good entertainment.
4,WOW ...,"I don't read many authors and tend to stick with true life murder writer Ann Rule as I always know i am going to enjoy the writing style. A year ago my mom gave me this book to read and I finally got around to it 2 weeks ago. I usually read a few pages at night but with this book I could not put it down. I can not wait for my mom to share the rest of the series with me. I met Ms Noble this weekend at a show on our town square, she stated she was writing her next book and I can not wait to add it to my collection."
3,Great for beach reading or teenage girls,"Others here are right, the writing is a bit amateurish. Ginger--why did she speak like a ""hick?"" Yolanda's Reyes' broken English seemed too contrived. Too many ""damsel in distress"" rescues, corny conversation between Kendall and Tally when their lives were seriously at risk in the final rescue. A mature woman running outside in her underwear because of spiders seems like something from a romantic comedy."
1,Too big for my pool,"Bought this for my above ground pool, was supposed to work on my pool, but it was far too big and hung down in the water. Filled with water and leaves on top..big mess.Was always wet, ended up drying it out and never used it again."
5,Great Fit,"This is the best fitting cover we have ever bought. The extra holes in this cover are also a plus, no more pooling water to empty off the top."
4,not too shabby,"We didn't really get a chance to use it this year, but I think it's fine for the price we paid."
3,Pool cover is just OK,"I bought the Intex Easy Set pool cover for my Intex 8-foot pool, which I love. The cover appears strong enough and fits nicely around the circumference of the pool, but it ties with long white cording, which leaves open the chance of it knotting up and then being of no use. I would have preferred a drawstring with the squeeze piece that you push in and draw up tight. You could then get a better, tighter fit and there would be no chance of knots. Still, it serves its purpose for the small amount I had to pay."
2,Pool Cover,"Very reasonable price, but tore very easily. The cover ripped the day we took it out of the box. Every day that we removed it from the pool it ripped a little more. For the price, consider it disposable. It is great buy for one summer's use."
2,did not fit,This did not fit my 10 foot pool. I maybe could have really stretched it with the someones help. Disappointed that I could not return it.
2,"Don't bother, waste of money.","What a waste of time and money this purchase was (to me). The description says the cover is used to keep stuff out of the pool... how is that even possible with the size and amount of holes there are on it? Half inch round hole do nothing but let just about everything through, with the exception of large leaves and twigs from the tree above. Again, a waste of time and money, in my opinion.The only thing satisfactory was Amazon's quick and hassel-free return policy."
1,What were they thinking?,I dont know wht a debris cover wuld have holes in it ! Who ever did this is not very smart! There are no pros with this product.Cons lets in bugs debris and rain water.
1,Useless!,This is a nightmare to setup in uneven territory. Tried 5 different spots in my yard and never worked.Wasted money! Get yourself a membership at the YMCA and save yourself some money.
4,So Far So Good,"I've had this for just a few weeks and does the trick perfectly fine. Stays on even in high winds. Keeps most of the leaves and dirt out of the pool. And for the price, you really can't beat it. It also helps warm up the water a bit."
1,not worth the money,I am really disappointed in this cover; I am going to buy a better cover next year. When it rains water just sit in it and it is has made the cover bigger; it is so thin and cheap made. I have to get a shop vac to get the water off the cover before I remove it. It is very hard to take off and on. Spend more money and get something better; it is not worth the money.
5,pool cover,"This pool cover was very affordable. Easy to put on, lightweight, and ties to keep out debris. We are on our second cover now, as first one experienced normal wear and tear."
5,pool cover,"This cover fitted perfectly, and is helping keep my pool clean and bug free. Can be put on by one person and has a tie to keep it secure. Very happy with the product."
2,Not so sure it was the best solution!,"I bought the pool cover to help keep my pool water clean, keep bugs and other stuff out. It did a pretty good job for that but I didn't realized it would be a breeding ground for algea! My pool water was cleaner from debris but got a little slimey on the bottom. Next thing I buy will be a filter w/a skimmer instead."
1,pool cover,not the same as pictured it has a clear hole in the middle with serveral holes around the cover that I didn't expect that was not on the orginal cover I had bought with the pool
1,What's the point,"With the plethora of holes in this thing, the bird poop, bugs, grass etc. get into your water, the exact thing you are trying to keep out. This cover is worthless, look for one without ""drain holes"""
4,intex pool cover doing its job,Im so glad I found the pool cover on amazon alot cheaper than if id gone into any store near my home. Im so greatful that I can keep the kids cool and the pool clean without a headache!
1,SUPER BRONCO IS THE RIGHT NAME!!!,"I purchased one of these tillers on reputation of Troy Built.That was the first mistake. It will not till hard packed soil or any sod. I even contacted the factory and purchased extra weights and a spur to try and controll it. If you are tilling and hit a hard spot,hold on for life,or let it go. The forward rotating tines will drag you with it when they come out of the soil.(by the way I weight 200lbs). This tiller is dangerous to operate,because when it comes on top of the soil the tines are rotating faster than the wheels,thus it takes off.I tried to trade it back to the dealer where I purchased it,and he wanted so much difference,I finally sold it thru the newspaper and bought a counter rotating tiller. A world of difference.If you have loose soil or a sandbox to till,this tiller might work."
1,Glare screen badly packaged arrived shattered,the item was sent badly packaged the glass screen was shattered had to return it
3,This Book Needs to be Edited,"There are no references in the book to the applicaplbe practice files (downloadable leaveing the user to open the various files and determine which is applicable to a given exercises. I'm only in Ch 3 and have found references within the text to tables within the text that do not exist. Example, Ch 3, pg 51 references Cell B7 in figure 3.7.Figure 3.7 is a dialog box displaying how to change a field name. The book itself seems to have excellent content; however, I've found nomenclature to be inconsistent, practice files not identified, and references not accurate. Very informative book be very frustrating to use."
3,Lack of book references to practice files.,The book is informative but lacks references to online practice files. The online table of contents which is suppose to tell which file is to be used in relation to the book diagrams is incorrect (at least for chapter 3) which makes it frustrating and time consuming to get through. I've decided to skip to chapter 4...I hope the references get better.
5,Great recipes,"This cook book is has very interesting Italian recipes for baking.Michele Scicolone has several other cookbooks that have very easyrecipes, her torta's are to die for in this cookbook. Great Italianfood."
3,More than a book,"More versions of biscotti than nearly anyone could use, but it's a studry book and holds a cup of coffee and biscotti quite attractively in a pinch."
1,Be Careful!!!!!!,"I have never spent so much money on such a large volume that has so little useful information. If you are using Vista, check the other books available, this focuses on XP. I also bought 'Using Outlook 2007' and it is the same. The reading and explanations are easy to follow and understand, but I have found only a couple in each book that actually work. I do not know whether the high ratings given these books are XP users who have used limited information; but the ratings sure fooled me. I borrowed a 'Dummies' book and it has much more useful information."
2,Special Edition Using Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 Review,I didn't really like this book because it goes over a lot of basic things that I already knew about Microsoft and then the things that I needed help with was hidden away within the book and I just did not have the time to read through it.
4,Awesome book!,"WONDERFUL book! I loved the adventure and historical context of The Raider! But more importantly, I LOVED the characters! I don't know why everyone is saying bad things about Jessica - I think she was absolutely incredible. Yes there were times where I questioned why she hadn't figured out that it was Alex - why couldn't she look at his eyes, hands, or lips and know who he was? But I loved the ending and the way she accepted him. Overall wonderful read - perhaps not the VERY top of my list, I think that place is held by Eternity then Mountain Laurel, but certainly close! Definitely pick up The Raider for the American version of The Scarlet Pimpernel and Zorro!"
4,Great Book,I thought this was a very funny and enjoyable book. I almost felt like there were three main characters instead of two. When I started the book I wasn't sure if it was really of interest to me (I thought it was going to be like Batman or Spiderman about a guy with an alter ego)(even though it wasn't!) but after the first chapter I was totally hooked. I really enjoy this author's books.
2,"ok, not as interesting as I'd hoped",This book spends most of the time dwelling on mundane facts of Bettie's life and explaining it in a bland way.
2,"A poor to middling, tired tell-all.","I found the book to be poorly written, and entirely devoid of any REAL information. Foster recited the same anecdotes as every other author to ever write about Betty, and generally with a lower level of literary talent. I found the book to be tiresome and needlessly pompus. I highly recommend this book to insomniacs and masochists. If novices to the so-called 'Betty Revival' need a good jump-in point, I highly recommend Bunny Yeager's book on Betty, while it has many of the same problems as Foster's poor book, it WAS written by Yeager, a verteran of the pin-up industry, which at least allows for some UNIQUE perspective. pd"
5,"Please rate the recording, NOT your Amazon experience . . .","Why would one give the RECORDING IN QUESTION a rating of one star . . . when the PROBLEM was entirely NOT the fault of Charles Mackerras, or the LSO, or Telarc, or even Rimsky-Korsakov, for that matter? Yeah, I don't know, either. It appears that Amazon--being run by humans--was less than perfect and just flat-out screwed up. I can't imagine that Amazon wouldn't correct the problem, if one would ask nicely.Anyway, I own this disc, and it is wonderful. The recorded sound is vibrant and rich, befitting these lush romantic masterpieces very well. Listening to this evocative music, one is easily transported to the ancient middle-east or to Spain. The violin solo work on both pieces is crisp and immediate.For $15 (two lunches) you get an hour of musical fantasy that you can enjoy for a lifetime. I have no problem giving this a five-star rating, and I can thank of no (sane) reason for giving it one star.Mike"
5,Review MD-12 Motor Drive for FM2,"This item was new as described on ebay, its functions work properly. It was a great item that I got on Ebay"
1,Very disappointed,"""The Sword"" got good reviews from several sources, and I am surprised and disappointed at how much I disagree with their opinions. I was only able to read 100 pages before I gave up in disgust. I feel that the writing has the over-done and over-emphasized qualities that are usually found (and expected) in second-rate romance novels. I found it especially disconcerting that the story doesn't even *start* to focus on the characters highlighted on the cover blurb until page 111. I am returning the book to the store I bought it from. I feel that it was such a waste of my time that I want my money back."
3,Good,The Sword is a novel to pass the time. It is the first of a trilogy. The Ring is next. The Chalice last. I've read all three.
4,Starts slow but ends strong,"The first part of the book seems a little detached...it isn't until the second part of the book begins that I found the book to have some real merit. The Sword take a traditional fantasy approach with eldin (elves), humans and dwarves, though the author does add her own twist to how these races mingle and what powers they utilize.She does a good job of bringing out the personalities of her characters, though they were sometimes RIGID in their roles and therefore somewhat predictable in their reactions to circumstances. And the author's use of religion and race as a force to drive the characters into a storyline was interesting, though not overly done. Don't get me wrong, the book is great, I just saw some minor things that bugged me just a little.And I did like the spin of the overall story enough to purchase the next book in the sequel. A good one to read."
5,Excellent,"This works great, and even fits out Britax convertible car seat. What a great invention! And it's so convenient in cold weather areas."
4,A LIMITED VIEW OF THE PENNEY STOCK ARENA,"The book was excellent reading to supplement my knowledge of penny stock investing. Weaknesses include the strategies and emphasis on trading exclusively on the over-the-counter bulletin boards. Any reader who is interested in unemotional, systematic strategies including trading penny stocks on Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, and American Stock Exchange, may wish to browse through MAKING DOLLARS WITH PENNIES: HOW THE SMALL INVESTOR CAN BEAT THE WIZARDS ON WALL STREET, by R. Max Bowser. Bowser shares his twenty-two years experience in the penny stock arena. I think it encompasses a more comprehensive approach to investing in these type stocks."
5,EXCELLENT!,"A MUST book for anyone interested in the Penny Stock Market! Excellent for beginners! Easy to understand text! If this book doesn't help you in the fast growing market, nothing will!"
1,I was mislead by good reviews.,"I am a book guy when it come to learning/solving problems on the computer. I have some great books that help me out every time I have a question. This book is sooo not one of them. I always go to this book first when I have a question about Word 2007, and it always disappoints. What the heck book were all these reviewers using? Awful."
2,my 2 cents,"I found the quality to be a bit squalor. One of the more regretful purchases. It's not even cotton and the fit is just weird, well if you must get a tool tshirt, get a large size - maybe I made a mistake getting a small so it fit me well but the cloth is of a strange kind - the cheap kind I guess."
4,A Healthier Life,"This book is a must read for everyone. I believe if people could apply what they read in this book to life, it would strongly impact those around them and themselves. Life is not about what it gives you, but what you give in life to enjoy it."
2,Just not much there,"The message in this book is genuine and could be helpful if you've never ever read any business advice or self-development books. But it's just a rehash of lots of other stuff in painfully simple terms. Every few pages has a huge quote taking up a full page, so the book only really comes out to about 80 pages of actual text, and this is on very small pages with the text evenly spread out.It's a nice try but there are so many other books worth your money: Good to Great, The 4-Hour Work Week, 7 Spiritual Laws of Success, Never Eat Alone, the War of Art...read all those first."
4,Great read!,"This was a very worthwhile read. I also have Von-Hippel Lindau, but I strongly recommend it to anyone. It focuses on being positive and having a better outlook on everything. This relates to having health problems, family life, work, or just life in general. A must-read!"
1,Do Not Buy This Book!!!!!!!!,"Do not waste your time with this rip off. They charge you $18.00 to tell you one thing. ""Be nice to people and it will make you feel good."" This book is extremely short, double spaced and a complete waste of time. The authors probably wrote this thing in less than a week.I am so sick of these purported ""helpers"" that gouge the public out of their money without offering a damn thing. This is beyond disgusting. This is thievery.There is nothing new here. Move along."
3,Good - but strong workplace orientation,"The concept behind this book is good - focusing on the positives in your interactions with others. I was disappointed by the heavy focus on office interactions (which is fine, just didn't happen to suit why I bought the book). Also disappointed by the lack of depth. Not including the intro and epilogue, book is less than 100 pages with very large type and margins. That includes over a dozen pages with a graphic of a bucket with a single quote inside. Good news/bad news - you can read and get all of the content in under an hour. Certainly not worth the full retail price, questionable even at Amazon's discounted price. I gave it 3 stars because the concept is good and I got some worthwhile tips, but this felt more like a pamphlet that a motivational company would use as a giveaway rather than a book. HOWEVER, If my work team were having interpersonal issues, I might very well give this 5 stars for providing a good discussion foundation in a group setting."
1,Steer Clear!,"Although the product worked initially, it soon stopped working completely. To make matters worse, their return policy involves waiting a month for them to get around to testing the item, then deciding what to do with it! I offered to purchase a new one and then have them credit me for the defective one, which they refused! It's been two weeks since I shipped the item back to them by FedEx and they still haven't even looked at it. Now I'm going to purchase a better product, one that works, and one from a manufacturer that treats customers better!"
4,Revenge!,"The first of a trilogy by director Chan Wook Park. One of the top Korean directors working. You may have missed this one especially if you haven't seen OLDBOY or LADY VEANGEANCE! This movie isn't as visually spectacular as the two but it makes up for that with raw in your face violence. A story about a stolen kidney and a kidnapping gone wrong. The blood is intense and the action is a little brutal. All in all a fresh raw take on the revenge plot. Great acting, cinematography, and direction. This is just the start of a master coming into hs own!!!"
4,Painful story to watch,"Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance starts off simply. Ryu loves his sister very much. She is sick, and needs a kidney transplant, but first they don't have the kidney, and later they don't have the money. To get the money the boy's patriot girlfriend hatches a plot to kidnap his former boss' daughter and ask for a ransom. But things get complicated, accidents and misunderstandings happen, and people end up dead.There are actually two Mr. Vengeances that the story follows, both trying to seek redemption and going about it the wrong way. Neither of them are evil men, but the loss of their loved ones leads them to do things that would be ordinarily beyond their nature.This is a slow quiet film, the violence that unravels is like a slap in the face. The ending is heart breaking, and hard to watch, but it couldn't have ended any other way."
2,Ridiculous,"Are people comparing this to Oldboy? Oldboy was flabbergasting. It delivers an invisible slap of surprise on the watcher's face. Mr. Vengeance fails miserably at creating any sort of effect whatsoever. The storyline is a bit challenged, if you ask me. There is no real feeling of revenge and most of the time the screenplay with characters coming in and going out creates confusion. It took me a while to understand what's actually going on. I watched this 40 days back and can't even recall what happens in the end. What's even more confusing is that I've known to have a prodigious memory of mind, or atleast I claim to.In any case, absolute bollocks of a movie watching experience. Avoid."
3,I came to mock,"But IRON CHEF USA isn't all that bad. I'm a big fan of the Japanese Iron Chef program and was, heeding reviews of the Iron Chef USA television series when it first came out, a little apprehensive about this one. It doesn't have the exotic charm of the Japanese Iron Chef series, and William Shatner is way too well known to play what should be the mysterious Chairman, but other than that this is a decent rental. IRON CHEF USA is to the original what The Magnificent Seven is to Seven Samurai - a painless way to kill time with some bright moments, but it can't hold a candle to the original."
5,live is best,"I saw Fono play at an MP3 tour in Visalia California with 5 other bands. GooGoo Dolls were the frontliners and let me tell you that by far Fono and Tonic stole the show. The boys from London sound great live, they are hot and nice as well. I bought their CD at the show and they where gracious enough to sign it for me. If you ever get the chance to see them perform you won't be dissappointed. Keep it up guys, looking forward to hearing your next album and hopefully seeing you guys on the charts!"
2,A little disappointed,"I bought this to put out on the new deck. After a few months exposed to the elements, the cage part and screws have rusted greatly. The grill part is still holding up very well. We now only use this as a grill and not an outdoor fireplace."
3,Funky 70s Bollywood samplers,"Mesmerising collection of sampler tracks from the composer duo Kalyanji-Anandji. Interspersed with corny dialogues from the movies, which inject humor. Amitabh Bachchan does the honors in Tracks 5 and 9.The additional beats add to the tempo of the tracks. Good to see such material unearthed from inane, forgotten movies from India. Should be a breath of fresh air to the western audiences looking for something different."
3,An interesting way of looking at a much-written about topic,"This first book tells us the story of Art's parents, how they met, and how their lives changed as Hitler took over Europe. The story moves back and forth from Art's father's life in WWII Poland to 1980s New York. I felt that the drawings showing depictions of different races as animals put such a different spin on the Holocaust. Plus, when you think that the Nazis treated the Jews at ""less than human"" it seems to make sense on more than one level. I was eager to start the next book, for this book ends with Art's father arrives at Auschwitz."
3,"It's a comic book, but not kid-friendly","This was required 7-th grade reading for my daughter, but since it is a sensitive subject, I read the book to together with her. Also, in Massachusetts the state education curriculum doesn't touch world history until 9th grade, so she had no clue what any of the historical references were. Therefore for each page that took 10 seconds to read (it's in comic book format), we probably spent 5 minutes in explanation of what was going on.Bottom line: if you are familiar with the history of the Holocaust, this book is an interesting take on the subject. If you have not studied WWII, the book will be confusing."
4,engaging,Very interesting and at times sad story about a family trying to survive during world war II. Would definitely recomend this series.
4,Poignant,"Maus, A Survivor's Tale is a son's pictorial version of his father's story of survival during WWII.Both haunting and mesmerizing, sometimes funny and touching, this is a story of perseverance and about what the Jews had to suffer through at the hands of the Nazis in WWII Poland. Spiegleman never sugar-coats what his father had to endure in order to keep he and his wife alive. A true work of art."
1,Slanderous simplification of the Holocaust,"I wonder what would the Jewish circles say if somebody published today a comic book with Jews depicted as, say, rats (actually, the Nazis have already done that...)? ""Maus"" shows the Poles as pigs, and it does that in the context of over 220 trees (the largest national group) planted in Jerusalem in memory of the righteous Poles who saved Jews during the war at the risk of their own and their families' lives. Now the descendants of the saved ones pay the Polish people back..."
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"It's sad but true--in more ways than one. Yes it's won awards and rightfully so, but if you only ever read one comic book in your entire life, Maus dosn't have to be it. The story is intense and important--and it's nothing you can't read in Night and the art leaves a lot to be desired. I think people who say they like comics and have only ever read Maus are not unlike people who say they are really in to philosphy and they've only read the Tao of Pooh."
5,Maus: What I think,I thought that Maus: A Survivor's Tale and Maus: A Surviver's Tale and Here My Troubles Began were both excellent books written about the Shoah. I think that Art Spiegelman does a wonderful job of capturing the true feeling of those who were painfully subjected to the Shoah. Please read these two books to have a deeper understanding of the Shoah
5,Excellent,"great book, compelling, and entertaining. Was shocked at how much I enjoyed this book. I did not think I would appreciate the graphic genre or learn anything new about the Holocaust. But I did!"
4,Spiegelman gives survival testimony a new form...,"Being a graphic novel buff and Holocaust student, Art Spiegelman swept me away with his portryal of Holocaust survivors. Seeing a testimony in print as well as represented pictorally has a way of displaying an honesty not possible in a traditional memoir. I cried and even smiled as Spiegelman took me on the journey of his fathers life before the Holocaust, his loss of ""humanity"" during Auschwitz, and his regaining of life after liberation. I would recommend any Holocaust student, or even those of you just begining to research this unique genocide, add Maus to your reading list. Your heart will bleed as Vladek's life is revealed through his son's artistic pen and through his own testimony stuttering off a tounge of broken English."
4,Big subject is well compressed!,"British imperialism is too big a subject for a 400 odd page book. But Bernard Porter compressed it into this small book, which looks successful to me. This book would be very helpful to those who would study modern history from now on. But it would be also helpful to those who already have some knowledge about modern history in that the author closely examined the relationship between British Imperialism and British Economy. Because my country Korea was once a victim of Japanese Imperialism, I never doubted before that imperialism is just a method of red-in-tooth-and-claw capitalism. Now I learned that things are not that simple. The author says late 19th-century British Imperialism was both capitalist and anti-capitalist at one and the same time, which broadened my scope of understanding. Though imperialism contributed to British economic decline, it also protected its citizens from red-in-tooth-and-claw capitalism."
1,out of line reviewer,You could memorize this book and still don't pass the series 7. There are better books than this. Stick with the discs.
5,A stunning accidental discovery.......,What a fresh gem this CD is from Telarc. Flip the lights off and rear back and savor the virtuosity. One of the finest engineered CDs of trumpet I have ever encountered. Highly recommended.
4,Wow Pretty good,"I haven't heard It Dies Today's new CD but this album is pretty extreme. There is a lot of Gothenburg influence here but what really struck out to me was their long songs and absolutely brutal breakdowns. This is an emotional CD but it never gets too whiny or too emo-ey in fact there is only like 30 seconds of clean singing total on this CD. What really stands out is the breakdowns, and the singer's brutal death metal voice during these earth-crushing breakdowns. Unlike some hardcore bands, these guys break it down like 5 or 6 times per song, so get ready. Good band, but On Broken Wings owns the whole metalcore scene in my opinion."
5,I truly loved Ms. Goodman's poems.,I loved Ms. Goodman's poems very much. She really gets to the heart of the characters of Pride&Prejudice.
1,don't waste you money or time- just keep a sharp knife handy,"I would give this no stars but not sure how to.I bought these at a local store (Thank goodness I can return them!) My family loves potato salad and mashed potatoes, so I thought I would give them a shot. Took me twice as long as it would have if I had just peeled the potatoes as I usually do. You have to cook the potatoes BEFORE you peel them - but only halfway- and if they are not cooked anough, the peel doesn't come off as easy as they say. Then you put them back in the water to finish boiling. The ""bumps"" on the gloves that give them the rough texture also started to come off with the second potato.Don't waste your money - just keep a very sharp knife handy."
4,Better than expected,I purchased this ring for someone who is enthralled by peace symbol jewelry. It arrived quickly and was of better quality than I expected for the price. I would buy from this seller again.
5,Wonderful guide for beautiful Belize,As a frequent traveler to Belize I found this book a wonderful guide to all the natural beauty of Belize.
5,Experienced RPG gamer's thoughts on Shining Soul 2,"This game replaced Final Fantasy II on my short list of games to play when you are bored. It took several years to do this, let's see why...Pros:1) Multiple character classes including a class only available once you beat the game! User configurable stats allow you to focus your character on a particular task, IE: healing(defense) vs powerful weapons abilities(offense).2) Text is easy to read.3) Gameplay for me has passed 80 hours over the past year.4) Forging: You can forge three ""minerals"" and get a random item or ""special"" item. The characteristics of the item depend on: ""mineral"" values, gold paid for forging, order of placement on forging block and pure LUCK! This is the best weapon/armor creation method I have seen to date on the gameboy platform overvall.Cons:1) Soundtrack could be better. Music for the stats screen is good though.Do not miss out on this game if you are a fan of Final Fantasy or RPG games."
5,pratical for all,I just started to do a study with a dear friend and have only done first chapter will know more later but its a good book for men.
5,AWESOME book! Every beader must have it!,"This book has some of the clearest directions for various techniques of beadweaving that I have ever seen. The charts and diagrams are marvelous, and the projects that are included with each stitch technique range from easy for a beginner to challenging for more seasoned beaders. This is one book I would not want to do without. When somebody asks me which beading book they should buy to learn how to bead, I always recommend this one."
4,Creative Bead Weaving....,"I love the book. It has lots of beautiful inspiring pieces. It's more of a book for intermediate and advanced beaders than beginners in my opinion, but that doesn't mean a beginner wouldn't get something out of purchasing it. I retun to the book over and over again for helpful tips and tricks and inspiration. I highly recommend it."
4,excellent starting point,"Well-written beginners book on candlestick charting.Bedford's style is easy to read and interesting - not only does she include the basics of candlestick charting but important chapters on western methods, trending, support/resistance and breakout trading. The end result? An EXCELLENT starting point for the novice trader or any one who wants to get into trading the stock market.Good diagrams and layout, as well as some interesting insights into trading psychology - an underrated but critical aspect of trading.Learnt a lot in a short period of time - and unlike many finance books out there - it didn't send me to sleep!"
3,"bought as a gift, did its job, cross country","Bought this as a gift last year for a cross country trip my brother was making. He used it the entire time, no issues. When i went to purchase one for myself, it was not available, so i went with a different brand,and generally, i feel its similiar. Radar detectors seem like one of those things, it either does its job, or it doesnt, no bells no whistles. if your going to complain about the loudness of a beep or annoying sound, then drive the speed limit.. its supposed to be annoying and get your attention!I will say, i feel this beep was louder then mine, and i do prefer a loud beep."
5,A wonderful journey to the North Country!,"I read this every November, when the days start to get short and the first snow flies. This collection portrays a lost and disappearing Vermont, a way of life on the verge of extinction."
3,Not Bad but has flaws,The case itself looks nice but i could never get the fan speed control to work. Other than that is just an average case.
5,Object of Virtue by Nicholas B A Nicholson,"This book is a truly wonderful read. The plot is fast paced and totally gripping, set in a decadent and atmospheric world that will stay with you long after you put it down. The glamour and tensions of the New York auction house scene is evoked with tremendous wit and insight.I am just about to start it all over again. More books please Mr Nicholson; you are set to become a permanent feature in every library."
3,a ghetto drive thru double feature,"it's great for all the guys to enjoy a good R&R watching these flicks. but not for a wholesome family to partake. oh by ghetto, i mean ""low-budget."" don't let this word scare you away, they did a pretty decent job for what they spent making these movies. ""i'm bout it"" is nice and quite entertaining. that's personally the movie i was going for until i saw this double pack. ""da last don"" is full of stereotypical and generalized personas. it just makes me laugh. very cheese worthy but fun if you don't mind the script. either one doesn't have the best acting nor the worst, but it's nice to see your fav rapper on the tube or plasma/lcd tv ya got. and yeah, the price isn't bad at all."
3,Poor Imax documentary,"Imax Documentaries as compared to say BBC or Discovery Channel documentaries are low on substance and big on camera footage. In the case of ""Seasons"", there are no breathtaking footages or even interesting shots of anything. Not to say that this documentary doesn't cover anything, but for $..., I expected more than what a sixth grader already knows."
3,Come to Duncan for help,"These two videos follow the same plot lines. Both women come to Duncan for help. In ""Saving Grace"" Grace is sincere and really needs his help from an immortal stalker who can't get over the relationship they once had. In ""The Lady and the Tiger,"" we get the first viewing of Amanda. The graceful thief who you will grow to love. She is trying to save her head from her fellow partner in crime from years ago. Why not offer him Duncan's."
2,Couscous did not work for me.,I heard about couscous and wanted to try it. I am not a professional cook and I did not care for my results. I have given away the remainder of what I ordered. The one concern I did have was that the boxes did not contain the contents very well. The grains are so small that they leak out of the seams of the box.
3,"Not their best, but still going strong.","Fleetwood Mac still sound and look great in their first post-Buckingham tour, but this isn't their best performance. The tape doesn't feel ""live"" at all; it feels mostly canned thanks to the over-edited videography. Stevie Nick's constant close ups don't help either; they don't fit well with the rest of the footage and are used far too often. She has definitely sounded and looked better. Christine McVie, on the other hand, is at her best. Songbird is sentimental, Everywhere is exciting and Isn't It Midnight shows she can rock out with the best of them."
3,The Mac abducted by aliens?,"This video was like watching a band imitate ""Fleetwood Mac"". I've seen the Mac and Stevie live and both concerts were sensational. This concert seemed very rushed,like they couldn't wait to get finished. I don't know why Stevie even bothered with ""Dreams"". As a HUGE Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks fan, it was very obvious that this band needs the chemistry between Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham to have that ""magical"" feeling. Christine did a great job. She was the star of this show."
3,Big Love Question,"This is not a review but a question - and I need an answer as soon as possible. I recently saw the ""Big Love"" video from the original version (not The Dance version). I was amazed by this video and I want to know where I can find it as it isn't on the Tango in the Night video. If you can help please email me, please!"
4,beautiful,"This is beautiful work. I hate to use cliche words, but Jacobik writes with a gracefulness and musicality (and music is everywhere) that makes her poetry a true joy to read."
1,Disappointing.,"The author's monosyllabic vicabulary utterly deadens what was an extremely interesting film. He adds no philosophy to the complexities, and adds very little in the way of plot. It reads like something one of the soulless Strangers might have written: devoid of joy, interest, creativity, and heart."
3,NOTE: Lessons are from Biblical standpoint,"This guide is written for use in a Christian school setting (for more info go to www.progeny.com). Each lesson is Biblically based and compares the themes of the book to Biblical principles, often referring the student to specific verses. If this won't work in your situation, be prepared to modify the assignments."
2,Not by Takahashi Shin'ya,"This is not the 1982 Japanese film by Kasai Yoshikatsu / Takahashi Shin'ya that Amazon makes it appear to be (search UPC 012901013331 for that film). Rather, it is a 1969 French animation called Aladin et la lampe merveilleuse. It is not known at the moment when the English version was first produced. This copy was released in 1993 by MNTEX Entertainment of Prior Lake, MN.The rating for this review is based on poor Amazon content and not film content."
4,Very High Quality phone,"I have had my SCP-8100 for 3 years now. It has been a great phone till the last 2 months. One of the hinges finally broke after the millionth time I have dropped it. This thing has been laying in 7 inchs of snow for about 5 mins before I realized it wasn't in my pocket, and it never stopped working. The only other complaint other than the hinge is the battery. I had it for about 2 years and I had to replace the battery. The life went from 30hrs too about 6hrs, on... not talking... I had to charge my phone while I was a work as so the battery would be good for my drive home. But, I went to www.cellphoneshop.net and found my battery for $12.90, when the same battery at my local Sprint Store was $69.99. Since I recieved the new battery nothing has gone wrong with my phone. I love it and I would recommend it too anyone else who is wanting a good camera/media phone."
2,Not all its cracked up to be--very misleading,"I've had my phone for over 6 months. Reception is generally good, with few dropped calls. Coverage is mediocre at best (doesnt matter which provider).Disadvantages are: 1) handset gets really hot after phone conversations longer than 2 minutes2) Ringing volume (meaning from incoming calls) extremely LOW even at highest volume setting. I mean you can hear the person you're speaking with loud and clear, but that's only IF you can hear the phone ring in order to answer it. I have missed so many calls because I can't hear the phone ringing!!!3) Downloaded games don't work: I don't know if this is the service providers fault, or the phones, but I downloaded 2 games, and was able to play them only once!4) Backlighting of keys extremely poor, so that you have difficulty in dialling numbers in poorly lit conditions."
2,don't buy this phone,"This is the second phone that I have owned. I don't like my phone. Here's why:-When I answer the phone, I have to wait about 1-2 seconds before I can talk or else the other person does not hear me.-The sound is too loud. I tried to turn down the volume to the lowest, but it is still too loud.-The whole hinge broke after about 8 months. I have trouble opening and closing the phone."
2,Don't buy it!!!!!!!!!,"Let me tell you something, if you are taking a class on HVAC duct system and if they ask you to buy this book.It is much better if someone else can share it with you, don't waste your money."
5,Wow! Hope there's more!,Excellent! Hat's off to Amazon for making it available and at a reasonable price!
5,Awesome,"Depicts just how extremists do not define any one group. Rather it shows how they mutate a religion, group,culture, etc. Great show!"
1,Good promise terrible execution,This series tries to be intelligent and thought provoking while being entertaining. It fails miserably. Its attempts at being PC while also being controversial are just silly with the general plot suffering and getting lost in the while.Save your cash and buy all seasons of 24 and the wire instead.
3,Another Mel Bay book,"Gives good basic instruction. Don't buy more than one of thes beginers books, and save yourself some money. Go to a more advanced book as soon as possible, to get much better music."
5,"Best, Bester, Bestest","When Connor's old girlfriend from Ireland shows up at the wedding supposedly with Connor's baby, it certainly is a shocker. But the shocker of the that subject is when Molly takes off without the baby and leaves Connor and his housemates to deal with hthe little tike."
1,Feel I have been gyped,"I only received on 5 inch silver wire, and paid over 20.00.Don't you know that TWO wires are necessary to make silver water/"
5,The Definitive Recording,"I'm often suprised that Beethoven's C major mass is not more popular. It's true that it's not the Missa Solemnis, but Shaw understands that. This is perhaps the definitive recording of this wonderful work, with solid performance from everyone, beautiful solo work, and careful conducting in an overall sunny style very appropriate to this work. The serious is not underplayed, and Shaw has done a great job of bringing out the delicacy that so many others want transformed into bombast. Recommended!"
5,Buy It!,This is the best CD of the year (so far). Although Kid Ramos has used talented guest vocalists on most of the tracks his own vocals on the last track are nothing to be ashamed of!
4,Nice big stainless steel watch,If you like big watches then this is the perfect watch. If you have a big wrist this is the perfect watch for you. If you have a small wrist I think it will look funny. The face of the watch is very big and is a nice sophisticated watch. I recommend it to everyone. You will not be dissapointed.
2,SALDOUS,"One of the worst I have ever read...It outlines many stories but some of these stories are only a page or so long which leads to them being not very informative. Some of these stories are only based on one person stating they felt a presence or had an experience, which even for a believer, isn't enough for me. No bibliography, excellent pictures, but too much opinion without giving you the facts and letting you decide. Seems to be written more for a teen or older child vs. an adult. My niece read this book and loved it, but she is 10. I have loved almost every book on hauntings and ghosts I have ever read, and this is one of the unfortunate exceptions. If you prefer something that will keep you scared and awake at night, this isn't the book."
1,Don't be fooled by the cover...,"Yes, the book has a great cover, but it isn't what I had hoped it would be. Why?The content isn't actually original, enlightening, or even interesting. It reads like a long, mediocre essay on the subject of ghosts and hauntings.For example, there is a story about a man living in an apartment who always comes home to find his cat outside by the door. He then proceeds to lock the cat in the bathroom. Again, the cat is outside the door when he gets home. The story ends abruptly. There is no explanation as to what this means? Might there have been a window that the cat could have exited from? Why exactly is this worth writing about?The author is more concerned with jumping from one ""tale"" to another instead of weaving an entertaining or compelling argument for the existence of ghosts."
5,Ghost story,The book shipped out and arrived quickly. It was also a great read for the evening. I enjoyed it very much.
4,Good ghost reading,I really liked Leslie Rule's Coast to Coast Ghosts. Makes me want to visit the places she's investigated. Look forward to reading more of her work. Good personal writing style.
4,Works Great,The Signalinc Repeater does what it's supposed to. It would be nice if the profile was slimmer (I had to pull the dryer out a good bit because the plug is directly behind it) but it significantly improved X10 reliability.
5,A Great Value,"This is a great deal per ounce, and if you bake a lot of bread like I do, you save yourself some trips to the store."
3,did really use it,"use it all the time and has kept my files safe,as said in the add ,and very fast delevery,thankz would order again,liked it"
5,A Must Own,"This is a must own album for any Smiths fan or anyone who is interested in becoming one. This is the very best of the Smiths, complete with energy and rage, disappointment and longing. A true jem from Morrissey and Marr."
1,Don't waste your momey.,"I bought this toy for my son's 3rd birthday. He is a HUGE Blue's Clues fan. I had hoped this toy would be good for keeping him busy on long car rides too. Needless to say he unwrapped it, studied it, juggled the inserts and the magnifying glass, and then tossed it aside. I showed him how to use it and tried to play it with him but no luck. He picked it up a few days later only to dismantle the clue strips from the inserts. These of course are all lost now. My 16-month-old showed a little more enthusiasm for the toy since she recognizes the characters but after a couple of weeks both kids are disinterested."
2,This Stinks!,"I was under the belief this was the ""original soundtrack"", i.e. meaning it was from the movie of the same title. No such luck! First, they're not even the same performers. Second, some of the most popular songs are missing! They're not even on the album! If you're looking for the ""original soundtrack"" of the movie starring Donnie Osmond, STAY CLEAR OF THIS PIECE OF TRASH!! (I'd return it but it would cost me more than what the thing is worth...this will definately go out in the next yard sale and I can only hope I'll get a buck or two for it!)."
2,Definitely NOT the Movie Soundtrack!!!,"I agree! I also have this soundtrack and it is a huge disappointment. The songs don't have the same passion and the different voices completely distort the visual memory that you have in your head. Whenever I want to listen to the soundtrack I've resorted to running the actual movie on my iPod just for the audio even while in the car. The songs on this CD and its related MP3's will feel like an insult to the movie. Much respect to the actual singers, but whoever in production allowed this as the ""final soundtrack"" made a huge mistake."
3,Good contemporary dance DVD,"Good! It's from the 80's. I'll like to see a more recent performance, but it is very good."
5,"The original ""Reality Adventure""",Hands down the best book of it kind. Tilman picked up the trail where Joshua Slocum packed it in and added climbing to the adventure. You'll want to pick up your ice-ax and practise bowlines for a Spring voyage to South Georgia or Greenland.
5,Another must see for fans of extreme horror.,"A teenager is being extorted by a gang of thugs which is lead by a childhood friend of his. To complicate things, his former friend is also a sadistic homosexual who wishes to take him as his lover. His situation becomes more and more bleak until he answers an online ad offering to solve his problems. Through the ad he meets three other misfit teens who agree to help him pay his debt to the gang. Things go horribly wrong when the gang bursts in on the newfound friends and makes it clear that they will not buy their way out of trouble. In the end our lead gets his revenge, but loses his humanity in the process.This movie is very much like the first in the series, and if you enjoy violent horror with a touch of sadism, then this film is definitely for you."
1,It is a doorstop - save your money!!,"This 50W DK subwoofer came free after I purchased the projector. Either I got a lemon, or they simply aren't worth the box they ship it in. Don't buy it, you will regret it as soon as you hear it.On the other hand, I still love myOptoma DV10 MovieTime Home Theater DLP Projector With Built-In DVD Player, but I hooked it up to aSony HT-DDW700 Complete 5.1-Channel DVD Home Theater Systeminstead. As of today (9/1/2007) this Sony package is selling for $169.00. Together, these are a great combination."
5,Mandy's got the beat!,"I love Mandy's new single Candy, but my absolute fave is ""Quit Breakin' My heart,"" i totally love it and can't get it out of my head! i can't wait till her CD comes out!"
3,IT WAS GOOD~~,"The first time I heard the song, it sounded origional and up to date, but after I bought the CD, it got old. It's a great song, but HELLO there are plenty of other girls that could sing like that. We need a girl that can sing and dance and express issues about something OTHER than love. What we don't need are more singers like Mandy, because they don't sing with passion in their thoughts, they think of things that don't matter as much. And our society is already filled with girls like her. The song's got an origional beat, but a few times on the radio is enough for me :O)"
1,An Amateur Approach,"Marc Shapiro takes just over 100 pages to say what many authors have said much better in biographical information recounted in magazine articles. The facts are bungled in details from the books which makes me question the facts about J. K. Rowling's life. Were those bungled as well?Clearly the book went to press prior to the time when the name of the Fourth Harry Potter Book was officially released because it refers to that book in it's working title. However the last couple of chapters report ""facts"" about J. K. Rowling's life that take place as late as the last quarter of the year 2000.Overall, save your time and money for more worthwhile reading..."
2,Her life isn't all about one series,"When I had gotten this book, I was excitied on the prospects of getting to know J.K. Rowling's life better. Her childhood, motherhood, and other things interesting in her life besides Harry Potter. However what I got was not at all what I wanted...actrully exactly the opposite. Though it did have some parts on her childhood the things were very vague and gave you hardly any information. Half of this book was on Harry, and practically a lot of info in this book everybody already knows. It seems all J.K. ever really accomplished in her life were the Harry Potter books. The only reason I gave this book 2 stars is because it was informative on what J.K. is going to name her future Harry Potter books and some plot lines to number 5."
3,Hmmm... I think someone didn't do their homework,I liked this breif bio but I found a lot of inaccuraces. I was little disgusted by the fact that the author did not do their homework before setting out to write it. Otherwise a nice breezy read.
4,"Better than the rest, but not perfect...","I've bought several of these through the years (about 20 or so?). I can't remember even one cracking or breaking. They last really well, and the ability to see inside the containers without opening them is really worth the extra money. And they are quite large compared to other see-thru containers. My only gripe is the latches, though they work great when latched, they tend to fall off over time when NOT latched. They are in place using molded plastic, and don't fit tightly at that. Because they move around when not latched, they tend to come out of their slot. They are easily put back in, and still latch fine. As long as they are latched, they stay put, only when they are not latched do they tend to come off. They stack really well, and hold a lot of weight in and on top of them, a really good design for stacking. I still think they are worth the extra $$ compared to other cheap products."
3,"O'CONOR IS A TALENT, BUT","...this CD just doesn't quite brew up the magic of a WAM concerto. Just my opinion. O'Conor is fantastic with the LVB 32 sonatas. He helped me to fall in love with music all over again with that cycle. Astonishing touch - of joy, wonderful rhythms, and fluidity. Still, it takes real luck, skill, and sound engineering (etc.) to pull off these WAM pieces. The greats can always have a CD that just doesn't cohere. I give O'Conor's LVB 32 about 20 stars...and this CD a 3.Maybe try Brendel/Marriner for great Mozart chemistry."
4,Good quick read with a too quick ending,"The Chalice wraps up the trilogy about the kingdoms of Nether and Mandria (roughly based on the Enlightenment courts of Peter I of Russia and Louis XIV of France respectively, only more ""medieval""). The Chalice is restored, Faldain is proclaimed king and he proposes to Alexeika Volvn.The book is mostly a solid fantasy if slightly cliched and a little predictable, but it is a fast easy read with well-drawn characters, some of whom die or are enslaved. A few of the characters are annoying (Alexeika in particular drove me crazy), but realistic.As for other readers, the ending is too quick. The rebels storm the capital and they take it. It could have easily been made into another book about their campaign against Muncel. I am curious about the ""sequels"" to this trilogy and will read them when I get the chance."
2,Shaker Crib Does not Convert into Toddler Bed,"My daughter is 20 months and I wanted to convert the crib into a toddler bed. To our surprise we found out that it doesn't, very disappointing especially that we liked the crib. We also bought all the matching furniture. Should have been well noted at the store."
4,A Ghoulishly Good Read,"May Bird is a skinny, knobby kneed girl with no friends and a hairless cat. Her mother wants to take her from her beloved woods in the hills of West Virginia to a boarding school in New York City. One day May finds a letter, a call for help that changes her life. As May is drawn into the Ever After she discovers many things, not the least of which is friends.This book is dark, and, perhaps for small children, a bit frightening; it is also touching, and at times, funny. The pace is lively, the dangers are immense, and the ending is wonderful. Enjoy"
5,IT'S TIGHT!!!!!!,"overall the album is the bomb... the highlight is the DRAG-ON joint, It's a comeback from ""Down Bottom"""
2,It's No Donnie Darko,"Although The Chumscrubber may deal with some content similar to Donnie Darko, it fails to reach Donnie's sublime climax. Both occur in suburbia, both have somewhat of a family drama element, both deal with death, and both have an absurd/sci-fi element to them. Darko's elements pull together beautifully, while Chumscrubber's meander, without a clear direction.I loved Ralph Fiennes performance, as the delusional mayor of the town, but it didn't add up to anything. The plot yields no greater discoveries of character, beyond the fact that everyone needs to take drugs because they hate their lives. But rather than having people change or deal with their problems, they seem to squirm about in them, never dealing with anything concrete or moving foward. The lack of dramatic action results in a film that, although interesting in content, never approaches the satisfactory build and arc of Donnie."
2,Too much singing on this disk,"When Sarah Silverman delivers her standup, she is very funny. Only problem is, this CD features 15 titles, only seven of them are standup comedy. The rest is stupid songs, which are supposed to be funny, and some lines in some songs actually are. But if you're like me and hate singing in comedy CDs, beware."
5,it's its mahalia at her best.....,if u like the baptist and pentecostal shouting mahalia this is something u have too have and see.i have all her vhs tapes and thisis my favorite....5 stars really from scale of 1 to 5 stars i rateit 10 stars plus....she's still the best to be gotten in gospel.i would rather pay 100.00 for mahalia then anyother gospel singer i know....she's still the queen on her thone when it comes to gospel music.no other gospel singer on this earth i've heard can touch her beautiful voice......she's still this worlds greatest gospel singer.....
3,ITS LITTLE!!!,"OK this is the smallest frizbee ever. Granted i did not read the description very well though. This is a 4.5 inch frizbee. you can't throw it. guess it would be good for little dogs, but my lab mix would just eat it. lol"
2,Titanic Poster,The Titanic Poster that I purchased came out very grainy in appearance. I purchased several other posters from other venders that came out much clearer. I would not recommend buying from this vender.
5,fabulous,"Miss PattyCake is fun and fabulous! She teaches the real, Christian meaning of Easter is a preschool friendly way. Miss Pattycake is an absolute favorite at our house! I wish Amazon would carry more of her DVDs with reasonable prices and prime shipping. I appreciate the the children in her videos represent differing ethnicity. Miss PattyCake has a fun animated face, making lip reading easier if needed."
4,A great read!,"Don't let the beginning of this book throw you. For about 100 pages, this reader struggled through all of the seemingly disparate story lines to find a connection. Finally, they all start to slowly come together to form an action-packed thrilling conclusion. This is the kind of thriller that will make you stay up too late or make you late to work!"
2,blah,"I don't like this book. The neighborhood reviews are too short and too opinionated. The author clearly thinks that owning a big pink house in the suburbs is paradise. As a result, his descriptions of the city neighborhoods are all scorn and no detail. Also, a big chunk of the book is boilerplate info from monstermoving.com that has no particular relavence to Seattle.I also got the Newcommers Handbook for Seattle, and I am much more impressed with it."
3,Fun Read but disappointing,"Book starts out with good intrique... it moves along and keeps your interest as you try to figure out where things will go. So, for the most part, it is a fun and quick read BUT the ending was boring and too disappointing - Mr. Woods could have done so much better if the ending had some surprize. Oh well."
3,Does not work on Crown Victoria,"This product does not work on a Crown Victoria (2000) despite what AC Delco or Amazon product finders state. In fact, most if not all Crown Victorias have no cabin air filter at all."
5,Being Dead is No Excuse,"Funny, funny, funny. And true, true, true! Funerals are ""gatherin' times in the South"". This book brings it all home. Great recipes (for funerals and other gatherin's)."
3,Cute Read,I bought this book becasue I love the Sweet Potato Queens and while this book was cute. It did not have the Queen's flair. I have passed it along to the gals I work out with in the morning to see what they think of it. The recipies just we not as funny as the Queens.
2,"Sorry, but I didn't like it that much","The book was recommended to me by an elderly Southern lady with a great sense of humor, so I had high hopes.But I hate to say, I don't like it. It is not very funny and it is a lot more serious than I expected.So, if you need some recipes for ""stuffed eggs"" and ""tomato aspic"", go for it. But I swear I think I could write a much funnier book about the South than this one.Maybe I am just too young to get it. I feel very apologetic about not liking the book, since all the other reviews are so glowing."
5,Fun book with good recipes,"This book makes a great gift for church-going southern women. Good recipes for pot lucks, whether funeral or not."
2,Car Talk Tunes,I enjoy volume 2 much more than this one. Too much bad language and crudeness in this volume one. I think I gave it away.
2,Chuck Norris bombed with these.,"These movies were filled with too much bad language and violence for my taste. BUT, I still like Chuck Norris."
5,Third time retains the charm.,"When Lacey Garrett takes a moment to answer a message board poster's question, she has no clue that doing so will soon have her teleported to another planet. Zain Masters believed that he had been scouting a simple, out of the way world. Then a hidden laser shot his ship out of the sky. Lacey is the only person who seems to understand the strange markings on a local monument. Markings that seem to hold the key to a way out of his situation. But something dangerous lurks beneath the surface. Barry's third book in the Un series is a fun adventure/romance, but the planet hopping plotlines of the previous entries is missing this time out. Lacey and Zain spend most of the novel in one place, a desert planet the Warrior Programmer dubs Death Valley. Despite the lack of world building diversity Barry's story is a delight to read. Highly recommended."
2,Style over (verly little) Substance,I haven't finished the book yet. In what I've read I've seemed to see more gimmicry than ideas.
3,"Awesome ""Knoxville"", AwFUL ""Overture""","I agree with earlier reviewers regarding this recording of ""Knoxville: Summer of 1915"" - one of Barber's most beautiful and hauntingly nostalgic works - is exceptional. Sylvia McNair is one of (if not THE) best interpreters of this piece that I've ever come across.HOWEVER, the ""Overture to the School for Scandal"" - a wonderful, playful, and above all, swift orchestral work is taken INTOLERABLY SLOW here. The ""Adagio for Strings"", probably Barber's most famous work, is well conducted here, although for both ""Adagio"" and ""Overture"", I would strongly recommend the recording made by the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Leonard Slatkin, of Barber's music. Here, the ""Adagio"" is suffused with more emotion, and the Overture is handled magnificently."
1,Re-Inventing the Past + Sins of Omission,"To believe that Paula could ever tell any truth except for the way she perceives it and uses it for her own benefit is ludicrous. The omissions of the physical abuse and trips to the hosital have conveniently been left out. And, in order to move on, she has left all the people who not only supported her emotionally but financially and truly believes that she alone created her 3 million dollar fee for this book."
1,"Gawd, what a joke!","I had to quit halfway through the book, it was so ridiculous. Is she promiscuous and naive or is it just me??? And how MUCH can you really go on believing that sweet Mr. Simpson is innocent? Get a clue, but more importantly, Ms. Barbieri, GET A LIFE!!!"
4,Fire Buff...,Really detailed book on the badges and history of the FDNY.Great for any fire buff interested in the FDNY.
4,Great bar feature,"Excellent product. Good quality, though the self-assembly instructions were a little lacking!."
2,Big disappointment,"Yes this movie was a big disappointment. I expected much more violence than what there was. A small scene where the White Arab attempts to force the abducted girl, Georgie, to give him oral sex and there was something that I THINK was supposed to be a rape scene, but otherwise no more violent than an episode of Criminal Minds. Pretty tame by R rated standards as far as I was concerned!"
1,IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I would like to give it a negative star but there was no choice of giving it a negative star. It is one of the worst math textbooks I have ever seen and I feel I have wasted 100 some dollars on it! Why does it suck? Let me clarify. It is obvious and naturally follows.
3,"Decent, but get something else","I've read over 75% of the book and worked through most of the problems. I have to say this book is ok at best. When I first got the book I hated it, as the subject is hard and the proofs seemed difficult to follow. After a while, the proofs became easier to understand and the book became easier to read. It was then I realized that alot of the examples in this book were vague. However, most of the proofs, of theorems, lemmas, and propositions are well written. Overall, I would not recommend this book. There is a newer edition out, and perhaps this is better than the one I used."
4,Seeing Willy Perform Live,"Paper Airplane has to be one of his greatest! I had the incredible opportunity to see him perform as a soloist in an intimate setting in Wausau, WI along with approximately 30 other people in a friend's living room. What a guy! His humor, wit, charm and talent is quite an unbelievable package. I strongly suggest this album for its DMB/Jack Johnson mellow style."
4,Well rendered old fashioned ghost story,The Uninvited is a compelling ghost story that will keep most viewers engaged until the conclusion. It is old fashioned as the two romances that are included seem a bit unlikely and forced and I think the movie would have been better without at least one of them. Even though the movie was filmed in California with lots of American actors it still conveys the feeling of village life in 1930's England quite well. Modern viewers will likely see the twists coming in the ghost story but this is still a very enjoyable film and much better than many of the the gore fests Hollywood has produced lately. The ending makes sense in the context of the rest of the story which can't be said about all films in the ghost story genre.
5,Great Ghost Story,"I first saw the movie as a teenager many years ago, long before I found and read the book. Both are great but I think the movie is one of the best ghost stories to come out of Hollywood without a lot of special effects. It's just a darn good movie from all points of view. I loved it when I was 14 and I still love it 50 years later!"
1,Couldn't get it to work,"What? Couldn't get ten year old technology to work? Well. It's my fathers computer and his old computer with an existing Zip had died. I had hoped to give him something to download his 15 zip disks onto his new computer. Driver found the zip drive, but the new computer wouldn't read a thing. Heartbreak. But he had a CD burner on the same (old)computer and never got around to converting Zip to CD.Who was it, the white queen in Alice,said: ""you have to run very hard just to stay in the same place""."
5,Computer Dust Cover Set,"I have a computer in my shop for looking up repair issues and kept spending money on having the components (printer, keyboard, CPU) cleaned; this dustcover set are keeping the components clean so they are worth the cost."
3,Mickey Mouse Plug,"Necessary and cannot beat the price. I thought that it would be a potential problem fitting the triangle adaptor, but it worked perfectly."
5,Great Cord,"I had to use this to replace my girlfriend's cord that she was using in China. It is a great replacement and was cheap. Shipping was quick and the product arrived in good shape. All in all, this product was the way for me to go and hopefully you will have a similar success."
1,Dead after 3 months normal use,I bought this cable to replace one that had become unreliable. It worked great for about 3 months but has developed the same problem the previous cable had. There is a break in one of the wires right near the plug. I know that sounds like I could be just abusing these things; I can only assure you that it has not had any abuse that I can tell.
1,Unsatisfied.,"I was really happy with the time it took for the product to ship and arrive; however, when I opened it, I noticed that the plug's prongs has small SCRAPES which may be ""BURN MARKS."" The cable is alright, but I just hope it doesn't burn anything... I bought it new too."
3,"Fast Shipping, but Not as Pictured","Originally picked this item out of the others not only because of price but because of the depicted picture. This is NOT the flat cord as shown in the picture, the one delivered is rounded. While some may consider this just a cosmetic issue, I have found that the flat cords resist breaking at the ends much better than the rounded cords; which is the reason I picked this one. Just FYI if you are buying this because it is a flat type. Also while cheaper than the original store, these are just repackaged Monoprice.com cables, it says so right on the package."
5,It works !!!,It arrived and I just simply plugged it to my HP laptop adapter. It works right the way.The quality is good. I would say that it's even better than the HP cable design.
5,There Country is as Beautiful as there Music,Been a Fan for Years and I always wondered what there Homeland looked like. Well the Music couldn't fit the Scenery any better. As you view the DVD you see Landscapes during the Songs. Its no wonder where they get there inspiration. Beautiful..... Simply Beautiful.I never felt so relaxed watching this Film. The Shows were not only entertaining. But made great therapy for stress relief as well.
2,Worked after a good resetting and cleaning,product was advertised with original book of codes and didn't come with it... kinda Necessary if its use is to be of valued..and the only books available are twice what the genie costs...
2,FoodSave Bag Storage and Cutter,I have tried this product twice and had the same problem the cutter breaks after a very short time. I will not buy it again.
5,The best Organ Symphony recording ever,"I heard this recording for the first time yesterday, on my car radio, which is basically a tin box. It completely blew me away. I've loved the piece for years, and heard many different recordings, but this one outshines all the rest by far, even on a tin box radio. I heard details I've never heard before. I like the tempi Badea takes. I had no idea that the organ and orchestra were recorded at seperate locations, and I look forward to learning whether the recordings were done simultaneously or at different times as well. This recording is a triumph of composition, performance, musicianship, conducting, and engineering, all rolled into one. A Not-To-Be-Missed experience. Thank you, Maestro Badea."
3,"Interesting, a bit self serving","Once I read a memoir or biography that grabs my attention, I always want to read about all the characters that are referenced in the book, and that's how I came onto to this book.The childhood in a storied New York landmark home were very intriguing. There wasn't as much objective detail about other relatives and people as I would have liked, but perhaps legal issues precluded that.At the end of the day, not a lot was revealed, and the 'bad boy' reference wasn't filled out enough, to my way of thinking. Still, it gave me more pieces of the puzzle of a prominent and interesting family."
5,INCREDIBLE!,"The Magic of You is my favourite Johanna Lindsey romance so far, I think I've read it over 10 times already but still, everytime i pick it up again, it makes me laugh over Amy's fiest and tingle over the enchanting romance. The plot is so refreshing and the way Warren tries to resist Amy is so cute! This book is a must have!"
2,I visitted Skipsville often,"A woman chasing a man to this extent is not romantic.It was like a foxhunt with her trying to run the fox to ground,at any moment I expected her to yell ""tallyho!"" It's ok to give Warren a nudge but this girl was outrageously ridiculously too forward to be believable.I finally got through it by skipping the more outrageous parts.Of course Warren was no dreamboat either.Unfeeling is the best I can come up with to describe him.To be fair to him though he tried to warn her about not setting her cap for him and constantly referred to her as little girl in order to discourage her.Alas she didn't take the hint.Halfway through the novel I still had no idea why she was chasing Warren.What qualities of his caused her to believe herself in love with him? I don't believe he fell in love with her either,he gave in so she'd stop chasing him."
2,Not what I'd hoped for.,"After the other three Malory novels, this one was really disappointing! Amy had no redeeming qualities that would attract an older man like Warren except for her forward attitude towards sex, and even that would wear thin, I know it annoyed me. Never at any point did I see where Warren fell in love with Amy, it is usually easy to point out in these Lindsey books, but with this one it is pretty unbelievable. And yes, Warren was not the oldest brother, Clinton was, and I don't think this book had any scenes in the Carribean either! Check the synopsis, it needs correcting!"
3,"Love most of her books, but this was a little ""out there"" for me","I love a good historical romance and most Johanna Lindsey novels deliver. I am not one to point out how ""ridiculous"" some of these books are and I hate people who turn their nose up at this type of book! I read them for fun and don't expect them to be quite like real life. I love it when there is adventure and when the hero does not want to fall for the heroine, but he just can't help himself.However, there was just something a little ridiculous about a 17 year old girl so quickly falling for a 40 (or maybe 41) year old man. No matter how gorgeous, sexy, brooding, powerful he is, Amy's overly zealous pursuit of Warren was over the top. Yes, as the youngest of the Mallory clan, she would be more worldly and knowledge, but still. ?? I gave the book 3 stars because if you are a true fan of historical romance, it was a fun read with some great dialogue between the two main characters. It just wasn't my favorite."
3,Not is good as the three previous Malory novels,"I love the Malory novels. However, this book was lacking in the romance that I have come to expect."
2,hot uncle in law?,"Here's a blast from the past for me. I used to really love this series. My tastes have changed somewhat over the years so I haven't re-read this for quite some time, but, if nothing else, I think this may have been one of the forerunners in series about a family (both the men and women eventually having their story told.)As I recall, Warren was the James' wife Georgina's brother (whoa, getting complicated.) Actually he was one of multiple Anderson brothers, thus to branch off to their stories later. Warren was the warlike one who ends up with Amy, the gentle one. Overall, not as good or as memorable as earlier books in the series."
5,"Good texture, easy to use","If you're looking for a good gluten free/grain free flour, you've found it. This almond flour is very finely ground, so your baked goods come out with the right texture, not too coarse. And, most importantly, they taste right. This flour comes in a re-sealable package, which is a big plus."
5,"Blanched Almond Meal Flour, 5 lb",The quality of this almond meal flour is excellent.It is very finely ground and very fresh. I have only been gluten free for about 2 months and have found many wonderful recipes using almond flour and do not miss baked products with wheat flour in the least.
2,Now Cost $11 More on Amazon than Honeyville's Site,"The product is excellent in terms of consistency (very fine meal) which is decisive in baking recipes where this is a wheat flour replacement. As others have mentioned, it lasts at least six months (probably longer) when stored sealed in a refrigerator or freezer. I bought the 5 lb bag on Amazon in July 2012 at the price $29.99. I was preparing to re-order in January 2013 and, to my annoyance and disbelief, the price for the SAME ITEM is $43.00 (plus S & H). That's a 26% increase. Went to Honeyville's site and it cost $36.48--(31.99 for flour, plus $4.49 flat rate s & h). So, what would have been a 5 star review for the product on Amazon, is now a 2 star review due to the exorbitant cost. I don't know about you, but I'd like Amazon to provide a justification for charging $11 more than the manufacturer for an identical product. Happy baking!"
5,I Use Almond Meal for Pie Crusts,I use this almond meal instead of flour in my pie crusts. It is low in carbs and is much better for you than a flour pie crust. It also stores well in the freezer.
4,gameshark memory card or mini game,half the people dont know what its for gameshark memory card or mini game the other half brather have mobile psx id like to know what are some names for the games
3,What I got.....,"I heard the songs on this CD a long time ago. That's why I bought it. The cover was in pretty good condition, but when I went to play the CD, 2 tracks wouldn't play at all due to a couple of surface scuffs. These scuffs weren't mentioned in the ""Condition"" section. I'm somewhat satisfied with my purchase."
3,not as good as I'd hoped,"I bought this CD for our 4 year old son when it kept appearing as a recommendation based on our favorite kids CDs.While there are a couple of standout songs on the album, and Wendy's singing voice is pleasant, I think this album suffers by comparison to the work of artists like Ralph's World, Laurie Berkner, Justin Roberts, or Jessica Harper. The creativity, talent and magic displayed by those artists in their children's music just isn't here in Ants Wear Underpants.I'm not sorry we bought it, because parents of a music-loving kid always crave variety, but it's not our favorite and our son rarely requests it, either."
1,B rate series not worth the time,I had high hopes for this mini series However it became apparent real quick that it did not even take its self seriously. I expect more from the BBC these days but back in the mid 90's I guess it down on it luck badly. I would only reccomend watching this if you want you want to gouge your eyes out with a spork.
3,Not to shabby BBC,I have really enjoyed this look at the end of the world through alien invasion. The cast was awesome. I think the look of a alien that is all organic even their ship is organic is pretty orginal.
2,A big tease,"This starts of fantastic and full of promise. Then while you're on the edge of your seat it gets behind you and kicks you off the couch stealing your popcorn and soda. You can only go ""what the heck?"". There is literally no ending, good or bad and you really get left with a bad taste in your mouth. If you're still thinking about buying this, I suggest spending the money on having someone punch you in the gut first, it's quicker, probably cheaper, and it will be easier to forget. Also, that cool alien on the cover is completely useless as part of the movie."
2,Yawn,"I guess if you find British Sci-Fi to be exciting and you think Dr. Who is the peak of their talent then this might entertain you. Mr. Ward is out of place in this movie and by the end I was hoping the Aliens would have their way with all the cast members and put me out of my pain. Not a good movie if you want original ideas, acting, or even basic special effects. The series ""Tri-Pods"" was more orignal and entertaining...where did they go wrong with this one?"
2,Sony MDRQ55LPB w.ear Clip-On Open Portable Headphones (Blue),"I bought these to use while working out. The sound was actually good, but I had to press the phones to my ears for it to be loud enough. This is not feasible, especially during a workout. The headphones fell off my ears while running, and finally during my ab workout, I gave up altogether and removed the headphones. It's possible that my ears are not big enough to keep the headphones on. Based on sound, I'd have to rate this at least a ""3,"" but based on function, I downgraded to a ""2."""
1,Not worth it,im big on sony so i thought at the price these would be the best. well they have no bass and highs arnt very good. after wearing them for a while they start to hurt your ear. Dont get these!
4,Great Binocs,"I like these bimoculars very much because the optics and feel are awesome.They are a bit heavy, but that is no problem for me as I use them mostly inthe kitchen to identify birds on the feeder outside so far.The eye lens caps are fairly handy being connected and attached to the strap.The larger lower caps are not so good. I think they will get lostoutside easily. Overall, I am very satisfied."
3,spray commander collar,This Collar works well but battery in the remote keeps comming loose and then the collar does not work have to keep taking it out and putting it back in. when it works it is wonderful also the dvd did not play in my dvd player.
1,save your money,"Bought one. Effective, but found the battery in the receiver needs to be replaced after a few days. Then, the unit failed at about 4 months. Because it seemed to help training I bought a second unit. Like the first, the second one also failed at about four months. Neither unit was ever wet, dropped, or abused. Nice idea, but product quality is lacking."
5,Great companion to Effortless Mastery,"Been reading the book for sometime now. Just got the DVD and I must say that it's wonderful. Granted the production is not very slick, just a camcorder recording of Werner giving a lecture.Nonetheless, it's great to see and hear him talking about his concepts. He's very funny and really has the whole room captivated the entire time.If you're familiar w/the book, this will be more like a reminder of some of the concepts. If you've never read the book, it'll be a great introduction."
4,Great individual bible study book.,This book was recommended to me by a friend and bible study leader. I am enjoyinging the journaling portion of each section and the personal reflection. It is a great book of personal reflection and gives you the privilege of drawing closer to God.
1,this review is for Panasonic SL-S200 - bad durability,"I bought the SL-S200 in august, and it has intermittently skipped since new, a friend who has the SL-S361C had the same problem, and someone else who has the SL-S361C reviewed it and said that his was constantly skipping after 1 week"
3,BushnellNatureview Spotting Scope,"I purchased this spotting scope for my sister to use. I have owned other Bushnell productsincluding a Discoverer spotting scope years ago. I am disappointed with the nature view's quality.It looks good, has good screw on lens caps and is light weight. 15X is the most usable setting.The fine focus adjustment lacks a good focus, it is too touchy. As you increase power the quality ofthe view fades. It is most usable in the 15X to 25X power ranges. It is a good spotting scope fora beginner or some one that will use it only occasionally due to it's pricing. If you want a betterquality, you will have to shell out more money. A really good spotting scope goes in the $1000.00and up range. My problem is that I own and use the really good equipment and this spotting scopecan not begin to compete with the really good equipment. Again it is good for the price and the novice.My sister will love it because it will meet her needs, me I will stick with the really good stuff."
2,My opinion,"The game system seems to work fine, but the large paddle controller barely works at all. The small controller seems to work much better. My level of satisfaction is just so-so. Based on the sellers statement that all parts were tested and worked well, which is clearly untrue, I would not purchase from that entity again, and recommend against him/her."
3,"Your joking, right?",Reading all these reviews confuses me. I still have my saturn and i dont see it at all like these other people do. Some of the games are pretty epic but a handful of games couldnt save a overall crappy system. The saturn was too little too late. Playstation destroyed it because of quality of the titles made for it. Some good games but overall the saturn needed to fail.
3,Operetta not Grand Opera,"This production gives the grand operatic treatment to operetta, inflicting seriousness and distance on what should be intimate, lighthearted and fun. This disk is disappointing and tedious whereas Mike Lee's ""Topsy-Turvy"" is vibrant, fun, charming, and true to light opera as experienced in a small theatre with pit orchestra."
5,Superb Mikado!,"Some trimming done, but luscious singing and all on one disk -- well worth adding to any G&S collection. And this return by one of the all-time great Mikado's will warm many a D'Oyly Carte fan's heart."
4,"Lush, but Misses Some Humor","Please note: I'm no expert in G & S, let alone light opera. Still, I grew up with ""The Mikado,"" as my parents are big fans. The version I recall from childhood (one of the D'Oyly Carte recordings) perhaps influences me too much when I complain of the lack of punch, bite, and general emotion in the singing here. The singing is indeed beautiful, but is that what you really want from ""The Mikado""? If it is, this is your recording for sure. If not, go for D'Oyly Carte. If you're on the fence, the quality of this modern recording might again make this right for you. Perhaps we owe it to G & S to buy *several* versions."
2,O GOD I WISH IT WAS DJed!,"This single is very underrated, it didn't even hit the US Top 100, I was shocked. The day I bought Try This, I was expecting this to be a big hit. Its a good song, well Pinks popular overseas well she's losing her popularity here, hopefully her next single will do better."
4,like a song at a long-ago dance that you can't remember....,"The second and last album by Scottish popsters Danny Wilson (the band named themselves after the 1951 Frank Sinatra filmm Meet Danny Wilson) may not be as good as their first, but it's quirky trumpets, conematic soundbites and byzantine lyrics do not disappoint. Also contains one of the most obscure and hooky songs of all time, ""NYC Shanty"", re-telling of the 1957 film, ""An Affair to Remember"": ""Don't tell me that you love me, don't tell me that you care, don't say you're coming over, don't dare! I'm not going to climb the Empire State building for you, you'll have to wait!"" What a swinging refrain! What a bitter sentiment. Beautiful!"
2,It gets pretty boring after a while.,As much as this is sort of a fun game to play I just can't the date Source graphics engine. This looks so 2004. I know graphics ain't all but there are many other great FPS games with better graphics I'd rather play. I bought LFD1 and quickly got tired of this non sense shooting at 35 corps at once all the time and LFD2 didn't got me excited enough to buy it. More of the same things.
3,Was a gift.,Not really sure how this game is . Was given as a gift. Have not heard if he really liked the game or not. Better check some other reviews.
2,A Little Disapointed,"I was kind of disapointed in this game for two main reasons.First, the CD you buy is only a key to download the game. It's kind of a pain. I like to uninstall and reinstall games as I need them and this makes it impossible. If I get virus and need to re-format I will loose the game. If I understand correctly, I will have to buy a new key. I also don't like the fact that I must have steam on my computer.Secondly, the game is kinda repetative and lacking. There are only a handfull of weapons and only a handfull of zombie types. Even more disapointing is the lack of story and the repetitve nature of each level. ""Run from A to B, wait for rescue, kill zombie army, get on escape veichle"" I'd like to have more interaction with survivors, (there was none except for the guy in the church tower, and the other end of a radio).Overall though, this is an entertaining game."
1,wrong one,Well the truth is. It is the wrong version of left 4 dead. I needed the one for Xbox 360. I will be sending this one back
4,fun stuff,"I really liked this game the campaign is fun and u can beat it but there are unlockable achievements and overall it is a lot of fun, just honing your skills is something i am trying to do and its an overall fun game that is basic enough and fun to play over and over again."
3,to short,linear game play; all to quick. Compare to Wasteland 3 that is so open and many ways and hours of play
5,Excellent fun,"I been out of the PC games for a while but finally got back into it with Left4dead. It is a zombie apocalypse game (dawn of the dead, land of the dead etc ...) You will have all kinds of fun blasting those dirty, nasty zombies. It is so easy to connect to multiplayer via the internet. You can also easily use voice chat over the game (need a webcam microphone optional)."
1,NO IDEA,"Well, first off I read all the reviews and it sounds like a fun game so I decided to buy it. Now here's my problem and it could be partly my fault for not researching more. Because this game requires internet activation I simply can't play the game. I am currently stationed overseas and internet isn't the greatest. Had I know this from the start I would never had wasted my money. I was looking for a good shooter to blow off some steam and was left scratching my head wondering why I spent the money for this. Not even in the product description did I see any mention of internet being required. I realize you need it for multiplayer, but you can't play offline either...come on people. If I could give this a -5 rating I would just for the amount of disappointment I had."
1,Internet connection DRM to play a offline game,"Steam or not, it still forces you to connect on-line and register the copy then it's yours. You can't sell it now even though you paid for it. Steam is like SecuRom just dished out differently, but it is still a draconian DRM.I won't buy it."
1,Got Scammed...,The quality of the product sold to me was terrible. I did know Valve Games required a CD Key just to play the game. And there is a Limit of one CD key per registration and this product was used. So this resulted in me wasting 25$ because the game did not even allow me to install it due to the CD key restriction. Selling Used Valve games is a fraud and should be Illegal. So what i bought was just a useless CD.
3,Could have been better,"I am the biggest fan of the Home Alone movies, especially one and two. The fourth one was okay, but it would have been better if the characters had not been ""recycled"" unless they were the actual original actors. I think that if they hadn't used the same names as the original characters it would seem like a better movie. Also, the actor who played Kevin just couldn't cut it. It is good to have this movie in your set, but I wouldn't have bought it if it didn't come in the set. It might be good for kids who haven't yet seen the first one."
1,So funny I forgot to laugh..,"When you're a good uncle like me, you have to sit through painfully bad movies with your 5 year old nephew sometimes. I don't get how something like this could or would happen. A forth Home Alone film!! O.k. the first film is a holiday classic, the second was quite funny as well. The third Home Alone film was a Hollywood sin, and an unforgivable one. Now lets end this.. this direct to DVD film is not going to appeal to both adults and children, as the first two films did. It's very much on the same level as the third one. Kids may enjoy it, adults might want to read a book."
1,Dumb Retarted Movie,"Wow I never thought Kevin's parents would get a divorce and Marv's mom! Oh please, where's Harry and Uncle Frank? Where's the adventure! Two thumbs down!Don't waste your money on this piece of crap!"
4,WARNING: Not a sequel,"Gees! everybody hates this movie, but why? OK, so yeah, they have different actors, and this turned out to be a disney movie, but who cares, HOME ALONE 4 haters could yell at me all they want, but they won't stop me from liking this movie. I think I enjoyed this excellent piece of work. H.A. 1, 2, and 3 were good too."
1,Absolute Torture,"This is not Home Alone. The producers of this film screwed everything up with their own dumb imaginations. I don't care if I don't see this movie again, because I really don't want to. I AM TELLING THE TRUTH. The snow is computer generated because this must've been made in the frickin' summertime and nothing is the way it should be. Not even the best film makers in the world would be able to pull THIS off. I THOUGHT I WOULD ENJOY THIS MOVIE. 1 star=dreadfully crappy."
1,Waste of Time/Money,"Unfunny. Painful to watch, but not like the other home alone's. Not entertaining. My five year old boy that liked the first 2 Home Alone's and loved the 3rd so much he watches it over and over- this one I couldn't even get him to stay in the room for very long. This movie should not have been made."
1,this movie is terrible,i did not like this movie at all and the whole cast crew producers even the director have destroyed this frenchise the 3rd movie was just as lame as this one but this movie is just utter terrible from the very begining to the very end and french stewart is one of the worst actors iv ever saw in a movie trust me people do not buy this movie it stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,It's no Home Alone 1 but it's good.,"It's not very professionally produced- poor music, grade c acting, and lousy camera angles. BUT it's not bad! Interesting characters and story line. And the kids actually really enjoyed it and watched it more than once this week. Once a year, as another Part of your family's Christmas movie collection, it's great. Just don't go into it expecting the magic and perfection of the first Home Alones."
1,Lots of Smoke and Mirrors review at mxdwn.com,check out a review of this record athttp://www.mxdwn.com/article.php?sid=228
2,You don't need a degree in music to know this isn't great,"Alright, I suppose I'd rather hear this than go deaf, but it just isn't a great cd, the songs are fine, it's the pianist and his style, or rather lack of any. I love songs like Lullaby Of Birdland and Midnight Sun, where in the hands of Dave McKenna would become classic versions, however here they are turned into easy listening wishy washy background music, if you like Kenny G, you'll love this, it's watered down lounge piano music at it's worst, but two stars for effort and song selection."
1,"NOT a jazz cd, but it's ok elevator music","The music on this cd is just ok, definately not four star music. It isn't elegant enough easy listeing music for even a lobby of a nice hotel. I can just imagine this guy playing in a Nordsroms and everyone just walking by because this music is like wallpaper it makes ok background, but is generally to be ignored, so if you like Kenny G., or Farrante & Teicher style easy listening this will be great for you, but if you know what ""jazz"" is, as in improvised or swinging music, this isn't it. Skip this guy unless your the type who rides in elevators just to hear the music that's playing in it."
4,Gary Clark/Piano,"A thoughtful, well-rounded collection of standards.fresh interpetations. Do yourself a favor!"
5,Her name is Youn Sun NAH. Her last name is NAH,Youn Sun's music is unique. But the most important reason I like her music is that it is beautiful.The main reason I write the review is that I want to correct her name. Her last name is NAH and her given name is Youn Sun.
2,Action 4 Pack - Volume 1,"I wanted to get some good action movies, and thought this was a good deal. When I watched them I was really disappointed in the movies. Extremely boring. I'd definitely check out the ratings of each movie before I buy one of these again."
3,Bought for Seagate BSY error fix,"I know a lot of people buy this cable to fix problems with Seagate 7200.11 hard drives. If you are, be careful.First it is an authentic 5 wire cable, instead of the knock-off that uses 3 wires which is shown in most of the demonstrations on how to wire it for serial comms to the hard drive..This means you will have to spend time figuring out what wire does what.Also, because it is the authentic cable, both ends are just about impossible to peel back w/o destroying the thing. I made the mistake of cutting the phone end off prior to plugging it into the computer. When I plugged in the USB connection wasn't even recognized by the computer (no sound effect or notification that a USB device was plugged-in thus it was $20 down the drain. Since, I'd already chopped it, it couldn't be sent back. So, moral of the story - check the cable before you cut it, and be careful once you do."
1,nokia-ca-42 usb cable,The item I received was not a Nokia product as advertised and did not work with my phone. It was aftermarket from china. I finally ordered one from Nokia and it worked. Nokia cables are all made in Thailand and have Nokia stamped into the plastic end.
3,nice product at first,"I liked the straightener a lot. it heated up fast and straightened my hair very effectively. my roommate had the same straightener but hers stopped working after about 6 months. in another review they said the light flickered. the same happened with my roommate's. then a month later, mine did the same thing, so I knew there was a flaw in the product."
3,Wonderful...for a while,"This product does have some kind of defect. I bought my first one and it quit almost exactly six months from purchase. Luckily I kept the warranty info and receipt, and was able to trade it in for a new one at the store of purchase. I wasn't so lucky the second time! This time it quit on me (flickering light, until dead!), after one year. You would think I would get a different straightener, but it does a great job until it goes kaput! So, I bought another one!! We will see how this one fares...third time is the charm, right? Just wanted to warn those that are considering this purchase! $15-20 per year might not be worth it!"
2,If you want to say NO TO ROGAIN.....,"I bought this straightener, and was happy that I could finally not have blow dry my hair straight every day... BUT the first few days I used it, the black parts around the metal bars (that straighten your hair) got one strand at a time of my hair cought in it. And THERE IS NO WAY of getting it back, so you have to pull it off and you have an AUTOMATIC FLYAWAY. After a few weeks, YOU WILL NOT HAVE ANY HAIR LEFT. BEWARE. YOU WILL BE DOOMED BY THIS PRODUCT!"
2,Okay,"I have had this straightener for about a year. It will get my wavy hair straight but not quickly and I have to use the high heat settings. Also, my hair does not get stick straight but if your hair is already pretty straight then this is a good straightener."
1,don't buy it,"Don't buy this straightener. It works okay and has different heat settings, but thats about all it can offer. I've used many of my friends straighteners that cost only $10 more and were at least twice as effective. Also, this straightener rips out your hair! Where the plates and the plastic meets, hair gets caught and rips out. Don't buy it"
1,dont waste your time...or $$,"I had read reviews of this straightener on the site, hoping it would do the job of straightening my extremely curly and long hair in a short amount of time, and purchased it. I was very wrong. It takes a while to heat up, and once it is heated up, it doesn't straighten my hair. I have to go over the same 1-inch section of hair about 30 times to get it anywhere near straight. Don't waste your time or money on this straightener. It's not worth it. period."
4,Perfect Heat Straightener,This is my third (3rd) unit over the years. Good ole' reliable Revlon RV059and at the right price !
2,Hit or miss,The first flat iron I had was awesome - I had it for over a year and it worked great. I left it with my roommate who had grown to love it as well. The second one I purchased was terrible - it lasted less than three months and the plates were defective such that several hairs would get caught and ripped out every time I used it (I am embarrassed to say that I continued using it for nearly three months despite the fact that it ripped hairs out every time). There are many other products out there at a comparable price. I recommend trying one of those.
5,gooood stuff :),"I was looking through amazon to try to find a straightner SIMILAR to this one because i couldnt find this exact one but once i found it i bought it immediately ....my cousin had this one n i would go to her house to use it every once in a while but now that i got my own i remember why i wanted one so bad.... so...straight to the point-heats up FAST-straightens hair like...""woah""-its plates are big so it does more in less time-has HIGH heat settings-the only thing that bugs me is the smell...it smells like metal..but im guessing its because its new cuz my cousins doesnt smell like it...anywho GREAT PRODUCT work every cent"
3,i love it ....at first,"i love this straightener so much, but i've had to replace it twice in three years. It seems like all ones that are professional cant be used for longer than ayear w/o breaking...it was very very disappointing, because one day it just stops working..and you're like...hmm...i wanted to straighten my hair today, and anyway, now i have a vidal sassoon ceramic one....it works ok, i dont like how it straightens my hair as much as this one did, but they dont sell this one where i live anymore....sad"
3,A Good Start But Needs Work,"Bobby Caldwell sings ok, but he needs to learn how to pronounce words. It's enough to drive you crazy! And the last cut on the record -- called the bonus cut -- doesn't fit at all. It should have never been included.One of the best tunes is ""Day In, Day Out.""Even with all of this, it's a darned good record with a great big band back-up. You'll enjoy having it in your collection."
4,great handbag,"Great shoulder bag. It has a lot of room to use as a tote you could fit a water bottle, a large book and more. The distressed patent leather look is also really cool."
2,Leather Loses Its Shine,"I purchased this bag in black in the spring. I have used it quite a bit, but definitely not everyday. By the end of the summer, the leather at the top of the back started looking old and worn. Much of the leather lost its shine. It is definitely not worth the money. I am already looking for a new bag to replace it and it has only been about 4 months. Very disappointing."
5,Full Samples for the book are Online and very cool,The person who wrote the previous comment didn't read the book's opening pages in the introduction. All of the 101 Samples in the book are online! Each one is very cool and runs right away. The samples in the book are snippets from those examples with plenty of explanatory text for each sample.
1,Just a guy trying to learn more,"it looks like a great book but it doesn't seem very useful without the companion content. It gives the URL at MSPRESS on the back cover.BBUUUUTTT, when you get to the download, the file is no longer available.One of the reviews above told how to get the material another way,it didn't work either.OBSOLETE"
2,Not a book for beginners,"Being new to VB I expected this book to help me through the rough spots. I am a embedded programmer who uses mostly assembly language, but wrote a fair amount of C programs on the PC using the old Borland 4. I find that seeing some examples is my best way to learn.You would have thought with 25 years of experience I could figure out how to code in VB.Well, this book looks like some C++ I have seen, not like any basic I am familiar with. Most examples look like cryptic C++. Perhaps this is the way VB6.net is, and, if so, I should have bought visual C++ because I know C, just not C++.I suppose the book is fine for experienced VB programmers, but I cannot recommend it as a highly experienced programmer 'trying' VB for the first time."
4,Netgear Gig-Switch,Product is deployed @ home and is working as desired. I work in the enterprise network space and I would not recommend this unit for that space. But it is working great in my home network. The unit does have SNMP support and I manage the unit using free-software found on the web. I'm pleased with it's current deployment.
4,It works - what else can I say,"I'm a satisfied Netgear user - I've been using their product (mostly switches) for a few years now and I have no complaints - they do an excellent job at an excellent price.I bought this particular switch so that I could play around with gigabit ethernet and jumbo frame, and it seems to be as effective as any of the other Netgear switches I have used in the past."
5,Great Smart Switch,This switch replaced a 5 port non-smart (?) Netgear switch (GS105) and I like the ability that this one has to see and control better the traffic going through it :-) It helped me diagnose a network issue in minutes because of its capabilities :-)
3,Hasn't worked so far??,"We live in a normal neighborhood of homes. No farms or other fly-friendly habitats nearby.However, for some strange reason, when we go out on our open patio, within minutes we have flies everywhere.Before I build a screened in porch, I decided to give this product a try.I sprinkled the tiny pellets around the area both near the patio and farther away around the yard. I chose a few spots I could easily watch whenever I looked outside.I never once saw a fly on the product, nor did the fly population noticeably diminish.I'll try again starting in the spring, but I'm looking at contractors in the meantime."
2,Very outdated,"I was not impressed with the lack of real information. I could have gotten more information by talking to a ""working model"" for 10 min. The fact that Wilhelmina has been a part of soo many modeling scams, makes me think that this ""advice"" is off base too. All fluff , and no substance."
1,Basic advice.... little real information..,This book had no real advice. Most of it was just common sense advice any person shold know. Seemed geared for 15 year old girls only.
3,Nice,"Our dog likes the higher eating position but for some reason refuses to drink water that high, so have to have the water bowl on the floor which kind of defeats the purpose. Fairly stable table at this point with no weighted sand in it. Nice but not great."
4,ok so far,"as did many others, i bought mine on black friday 2005. So far no problems with the bulb. Anyone know who i am supposed to call when it does go out?? It has turned off on us a couple of times while watching something. Kind of weird. But thats it. Picture nice and nice inputs in back."
1,INFERIOR PRODUCT!,"I have had this TV for 3 1/2 years now, and the Light Engine broke. Toshiba company would not agree to negotiate reducing the cost for the part. I replaced the Lamp bulb before I had it officially diagnosed. It's ashame how companies can't make quality products anymore and we have to waste products and purchase new ones at a lower cost than repairing the old. I would never buy a Toshiba product again. I am talking 3 1/2 years and the worst part was that this TV got such infrequent use. Its ashame!"
3,"Good idea, bad quality","This TV is a really good idea with poor execution. If you want a TV in a small space without wires and a big unit, like under counter in kitchen this is a good idea. The sound is also quite good for such a tiny little box. Unfortunately most of these seem to be flaky. Mine will flicker or have a line through it unless you jiggle it until it stops. Of course they are out of production now so the point is somewhat moot, except for used ones that appear from time to time"
1,Not Happy,I am very happy with the service as well as the price of the item and the shipping. The only issue I have is that this battery doesn't even last as long as the old one I replaced. We play the game for two days and the battery is dead. We don't play much either. Maybe an hour or two a day. I am very disappointed in the quality of the product but the service was excellent.
2,Not as good as the nintendo battery,"Positive - the screwdriver that comes with the battery fits the nintendo DS lite screw well.Negatives -#1 - The battery I received is a very tight fit. This is advertized on the package as ""you can swap batteries in a snap"". It was difficult to get the battery in, and required a small flathead screwdriver to pry it back out (the screw is a phillips, so you need to take an extra flathead with you). Not what I would call ""a snap"".The original nintendo battery goes in and comes out of the battery compartment easily.#2 - The packaging claims ""up to 3 hours extra play time"". I have not tested the battery because of #1, but my son has played for well over 5 hours on the original nintendo battery without requiring a recharge.#3 - nintendo offers a replacement battery that is supposed to be the same as the one included with the ds lite for $15 plus shipping."
2,Not nearly as good as the original..,"I highly suggest you skip over this, and purchase a Nintendo original. I purchased this battery as a spare, because I do quite a bit of trans-pacific travel. The claims for this battery are that it will give you 3 hours of play time. I find this ridiculous. In all of my attempts, I have received a little over 1 hour of actual play time. While I have had no problems with it fitting into the battery slot, it seems that others have."
2,"Fairly well-written, but...","...if what you want is a book about giant robots fighting, don't bother. This is a yawner of a mercenary/spy tale, with tedious descriptions of governmental systems and plots to overthrow them. There are precious few moments of mechs even being mentioned."
5,battle tech strikes again,"I think that battle tech just keeps getting better and better. This book is great I'm 11 and a bit know and I'm having no trouble liking or reading it. I meen I don't read very often but the other day I read for about 6 HOURS!! If you like the miniture game Mech Warrior Dark Age, battle tech, or just like a good book look no further. The book also gives lots of back groung imformation to the dark age collectors. this is a great book and I can't stop reading it. I hope you enjoying the book as much as I am."
4,Fantastic book for non-series readers,"First off, I'm a huge fan of Battletech and the subsequent Mechwarrior derivatives so I'm a little biased to begin with. While not having read many (maybe one) of the novel series, I decided to see what the Dark Age direction was like. I was pleasantly surprised. Stackpole does a fantastic job of telling an intricate, conspiritorial story. The plotline is very well thought out and it a treat to work through. If you enjoy a rich story, this book is a good fit."
2,"Nice looks, but that is about it","I lost my set of MDR Q33 and bought these as a replacement (since Sony has discontinued the Q33's). The only nice thing about these were the looks - the sound was disappointing as was the fit. They were not only loose, but uncomfortable. Needless to say that I returned these and luckily picked up a pair of refurbished Q33's on amazon.com."
5,sturdy,There are cheaper bars but this one is very sturdy and easy to installwith just a few screws for each bracket.
5,Interesting Book,"For anyone who enjoyed ""The Waltons"", you'll also enjoy the behind the scenes of Earl Hamner and his adventures making it. He has a very rich history and, yes, s wonderful way with words. Great photos showing the real family and Earl as well as the real house. You cannot bypass this book if you want to know the history of ""Waltons Mountain"" and the person who became part of our family for 9 seasons ... and is still to be found if you want to be inspired."
1,Like old style better,"I hate this curved style of the Vidal Sassoon handheld dryer. The attachments scrape my scalp instead of combing my hair. I'm buying all the old, straight style I can find and ignoring this curved thing."
4,Not too shabby,"There is a lot to say about this book. I just finished it and it was required reading for upcoming freshman. I must say.. It could have been much worse. the plot was confusing at times because there were 3 different subplots. One with Telemakus, One on odysseus travels and then odysseus' return home and being home. The end was pretty cool. It was hard to get into at the begginning though because it was like ""sing me a song muse"" or something like that.. that just really confused me but as you read it gets better and better.I wish you could just read a book and not have to like identify the themes and stuff.. I just want to write a report on how I veiwed it.. tell the story from beginning to end then forget about it. Life would be so much easier that way"
1,THIS BOOK IS SOOOOOOOO BORING,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It is soooooo boring and useless. So if you dont like boring books, dont read the odyssey."
2,a really boring book,"This book made me tired reading it, it was boring and long and it din't make sence. I say skip the book and go straight for the cliffnotes."
5,Brilliant,"A riveting and accurate rendering into English of one of the most important works in European history. The translation of Homer has been undertaken by different famous and not-so-famous individuals for nearly as many years as the 2,500 years the text has been extant. Robert Fitzgerald has clearly learnt well exploding fishcake from his contemporaries and older translators. He manages both to be faithful to the original rhythm and feel of the poet and also inject modernity into a work which changes meaning for us paralell to the changes in our own history. He shows evidence that he is a scholar but also that he is a human being involved in the world. I cannot fault this translation. Brilliant."
5,This Book Tells The Real Story Of The Teamsters Union,This Book is a must for every Teamster to read!
2,I don't know,"This cd is well....I have mixed feelings about it, to me all the songs sound the same as their other cds. I picked this one up along with another and they BOTH sound the same. I want to like it more then I do but I cant. I would suggest a better band like Hate Eternal or maybe even CannibalCorpse. Dont get this if you like variety. The only reason why they dont get 1 star is because I like the guitar and some of the drumming. Later"
3,nice book if you like quotes,"lots of pictures & quotes from disney princess movies.....that's all it is, is quotes & pictures though."
3,Wish it had Mountain Dew,"I only bought this for the soda recipes, and was disappointed that the ingredients contain Koolaid, which is an extreme amalgamation of chemicals masquerading as human food. At least he could have use food-grade citric acid. Meaning, if I wanted to include crud...I'd just buy the original product he;s trying to copy."
5,Mensa... whatever,"This recording has been regarded as ""required listening"" for choral musicians and directors. I doubt we will find better choral singing of this piece in our lifetimes. You should have heard it LIVE! To ""Mensa Girl,"" why did you need a recording to help you learn this piece? You are ""Mensa,"" after all."
3,Just okay,"The watch itself keeps good time, I love that it never needs batteries, and the backlight is decent too, I like that you can have it come on by just raising your wrist to look at the face of the watch. What I dislike about this watch is the crystal scratches way too easy so I have to put it to an electric bench buffing wheel about every three months to polish the scratches out. The band is cheap and started cracking, finally broke in two after only two months of wearing it."
1,This is what spoiled it for me...,"George was out playing alone when he encountered two men in a vehicle whom he had NEVER met before. They were friendly and told him that he was talented. The next thing we know is that the three of them get into the cab and drive off. Oh dear !!This isn't the sort of thing I'd wish to encourage, would you ?One positive thing about the tale is that it provoked discussion aboutnever going away with strangers even if they seem nice.We like the Curious George books and appreciate the fact that they were written quite some time ago, but when reading to impressionable kids it's good to make sure that you approve of the content."
3,It could have been better,"This book had the potential to be great. It had a very important subject, the romance of a ship wreck and artifacts.Alas, the subject got lost by the author's personal thoughts which were inconsistent.The facts could have spoken for themselves and made this a very powerful book. Perhaps someone will do the book that could have been."
4,Very Impressed!,"This is by far the most impressive Tai Chi video I ever watched. First of all, he actually breaks down the move step by step. He then starts at Tai Chi pace to a much accelerated pace which is the entire point of Tai Chi. Your suppose to practice slow to eventually become extremely fast.He uses all the Wu-Style moves found in the basic 24 movement. If you learn these moves, you will pass the beginner stage for sure.No space is needed. You stay in the space spot the entire time. Go from left to right. Right to left. I gave it 4 stars because it is a great video that delivers exactly what it promises. I believe 5 stars are for products that deliver beyond what they promise. A few combinations would of been nice or applications of the moves would of been nice."
2,Not for rear glass.,"This compact product offers a decent view of children using rear-facing car seats. That is, until the vehicle actually starts moving. The mechanism that allows this mirror to be articulated to properly face the child does not resist even moderate vehicle motion. This product is useless in anything but the visor-mount configuration."
4,Great for seeing kids,"My son sits in the middle back seat. This mirror allows me to see him without turning around and taking my eyes off the road. It clips to the passenger visor and has a movable mirror. I only gave it 4 stars because with any baby mirror, the image is a bit distorted since it is not real glass. Good enough to see his expressions, though!"
2,"Nice concept, but...","The idea is a great one, however the size and optics prevent it from being a useful purchase. It is not magnified enough to be able to see closely when you are driving and the actual mirror lens is very cloudy even when wiped with a soft cloth."
4,Better than those dumb ipod earbuds,"I bought these a few years ago to replace a pair of headphones that my dog had chewed up. Then when i got an ipod, i kept using them because those standard white earbuds hurt way too much. I find these very comfortable and I wear them for at least a few hours a day (if not more). I've actually had 2 sets. I got rid of the first pair because after about 2 years of use/abuse one of them finally stopped working. I've had these now for about 6 months and they're still going strong! The sound is not the best, but what can you expect for this price? I'd say the sound is probably good enough for most people. I recommend this product"
5,Have owned these headphones since 2005,I love these headphones...great sound and durability. I use them at the office and have stepped on the cable so many times and have never ripped. After owning them for 6 years the ear sponge had to be replaced but thats it...I bought cheap headphones and removed the ear sponges and placed them on these headphones...I use the blue cover on the right ear and the silver on the left ear.
2,Eh...I expected more,"Looking for headphones to go with my iPod, since the earbuds that came with it hurt if I wear them for long periods of time...Not impressed with these headphones. ""Rich bass"" my ear -- the cheap headphones that came with my last portable cd player have better-sounding bass. These Sony headphones are tinny sounding, and I need to crank the volume to hear anything through them (or press the 'phones to my ear -- the spring clip doesn't have enough tension to put them in that place for me).On the plus side, I suppose, they are comfortable to wear - I don't find that they ""deform"" my ear in any way, and they don't hurt. They'll suffice for running, but I'll be sticking with the Apple earbuds for other uses (plane trips, at work, etc.)"
4,Astonishing,"This book was published 99 years after the closed-door talks given by C G Harrison (no one seems to know who he is) in 1893 before the Berean Society (also couldn't find out what this is but Harrison said it is an association of Christian esotericists).Harrison gave the talks after the publication of AP Sinnett's Esoteric Buddhism. I realised that he has not read the Mahatma Letters which was only published in 1923. That's why I am astonished at what he knew. Is he a chela, I wonder? Is there really 'Esoteric Christianity'? And where is the Berean Society today?I agree that Christopher Bamford wrote a very good introduction, without which most readers wouldn't be able to understand the background of the lectures."
3,Beginner's Treasure,If you are just starting the whole scrapbook phenominon this book is awesome. If you are on into your new love hobby of scrapping you may want to pass on this book. It starts from the very basic of things. If you are just looking for layouts this book has some pretty good ones.
1,A poor film with an inept cast!,"This film has nothing going for it;an improbable plot,bad acting,most of the film takes place at night or in low light except for close ups.The script is that of a dime novel, totally unbelievable. The film won an award in Florida at a film festival,but I can't imagine why!I would suggest that one should view the original(1945),it has to be better entertainment.Susanna Foster, the only established performer in the film, didn't even sing!"
2,waste of money.,I bought two of these carpets. They were pretty when i bought them but soon curled up at the ends and also frayed. I would not recommend these carpets.
1,Awful,"Terribly cheap materials, the carpet was actually bent, not rolled. Took me 2 seconds to decide to return it. Do not buy!!"
4,Great Value,"Installed it myself, worked great with a vast variety of games (FIFA Soccer 2003, NBA Live 2003, Empire Earth) however, when trying to play with very high detail settings, animatios seem a little choppy. I Think it's a great value for its price, and will run a lot of games an apps with decent performance."
1,...,"I don't recommend this product. The appliance doesn't stay warm long enough to do the entire face. It stays warm long enough to do one side of face. One other problem is with the unit itself, if just lays in the charger so if it is bumped it could lose the charge connection easily."
2,Masterpiece Megatron is very fragile,"I'd consider not transforming it after you buy it. You might regret it later like I did. Broke the small left plastic thigh tab during the second transformation to a p38. The sixth time transforming it, broke the smaller upper connector tab above the right trigger halve that holds it in place in p38 mode. Will have to find some replacement parts on ebay for it. Will take a while for those parts to show up especially that the figure came out recently. Not in a hurry cause I won't be transforming him any more. But won't pay full price for another. Especially that you can't even transform it due to the fear of snapping those cheaply done plastic little pegs."
4,Best version of Megatron so far,"This is hands down the best version of Megatron made so far, eclipsing even the original G1 toy made back in the 80s, as this one is a perfect duplication of his G1 cartoon look. The only downside to this toy is that it is not as sturdy as the Optimus Prime anniversary figure that came out earlier this year. I'd say this toy serves better as a showpiece than as something you would buy for a child to play with (which I wouldn't recommend).But basically if you're an old school Transformers nostalgic nut (like myself) then this one is definitely for you."
5,megatron masterpiece,I bought this item and will recomend that any G1 collector pick up this ultimate version of G1 megatron. However this is not a toy that young children can play with. Nor do i recomend transforming to gun mode because this has fragile pieces. Overall this is the toy i have been waiting 20 years for.
2,Broken Thread,"This book made me work way to hard to get through it. In a nut shell the book is about Jews escaping the Holocaust. Some are in Italy, some are traveling to it. There were some parts of the book I enjoyed and found the history very interesting. I have always been intrigued by WWII and was interested in the part Italy played in this time in history. However, the novel is too choppy to follow and the constant change of locations made it difficult to form any real attachment to the characters. Just when I was getting engrossed in the story line, Russell jumps to someplace else and we are on to another plot. Too many main plots all going on at once and not enough pertinent information to connect them."
3,Coudn't connect,"I really wanted to like this book...I thought I would find it interesting because of the subject matter, something I was not that familiar with, Italians helping the Jews in World War II. But I just couldn't connect. The writing was beautiful, dense, moody, but I just couldn't connect with the characters. I tried to keep reading hoping I would finally feel something, but I think the characters were there to move the story, rather than the story there to move the characters. So, the story was interesting, the characters wooden. Sorry Ms. Russell, but I seem to disagree with all the other reviewers."
4,Lest we forget!,"It was an intense subject but I learned about the war I did not know. I especially liked the ending because it all came together--""Lest we forget"""
5,Great novel,"'s. Russell again does not disappoint. A gripping, unable to put down read. Recommend to anyone who loves great literature."
1,Where are the editors?,"By page 43, there were at least two grammatical errors in this book. The author deserves better."
4,"Interesting, but...","Interesting book, but with too many characters to keep track of, especially all with foreign names, it bogged down. Although the author lists all the characters in the beginning, when you're reading it on a Kindle, it's awkward to keep going back and forth, and distracting, too. Still, I enjoyed the book, I just thought it should have been simplified."
4,I like the idea,This book guides teachers on how to create open ended questions. Good Questions helps me differentiate instruction in my classroom by the way I ask questions.
5,Good ideas,"Very well writtenAs a math teacher for young children, it's nice to see this presented as a possible method"
5,Great Family Time,Brings back great memories for me and my grown children! I recommend this move to families who are tired of all the sex and violence in cartoons now a day!!
5,Loved this show back in 2000-2003,"I dont have to wait and watch it to review it, I have seen every season of this show when I was 14 and Im now 24 but I never knew they had made a movie, I loved rocket power and because I was a skateboarder it made it all even better and got me pumped up to go out and skate, Cant wait untill this arrives, Fingers crossed."
4,"Great, once they figure it out","Length:: 0:31 MinsWe give half of Bo's dinner in his bowl and the other half in the Cube and it's been really effective at keeping him occupied and slowing how fast he eats. There was a learning curve of a couple hours - I suggest when introducing it use really tasty treats and kick it around a few times to show there's good stuff coming out. With patience I imagine most dogs will pick it up. The biggest downside, and it's not really much of one, is that it can be a noisy process with the dog nosing the thing around on the floor and banging it into walls, chairs, etc., to get the kibble out."
3,"Good idea, but didn't work for us","This is a great idea, however the center came loose and my dog got his lower jaw stuck in it and had to go to the vet to have it removed,so for future and current owners the mini centers seemed to have a problem with coming loose easily and with treats inside dogs will quickly get stuck even while supervised(in less than 30 seconds while I tried to get it from him he was stuck)Before all of the commotion though he seemed to love it. He also was not hurt but had to be sedated to have it removed. I did follow the manufacturer's directions I guess it just wasn't in there tight enough which could have been my fault or a manufacturing error with the cube's locking mechanism, the vet was not sure, this is not so much a negative review on the cube but more a warning to other owners to make sure it's in tightly and don't leave your pup unsupervised with it."
1,junk,"THe center lock easily falls out, it will not lock in at all. My dog played with one at school and loved it with no food in it on a rubber floor, so I came right home and ordered it. Once I took the center lock out to fill it up, I have not been able to put it back in."
2,"Strange mechanism, only worked with the smallest of kibble.","I bought this for our 8 month old lab to keep him mentally stimulated. When filled with the smallest kibble in the world on the most difficult setting, this maybe worked for 5 minutes. The opening wasn't large enough for any normal treats (or at least any treat I could find at PETCO), and once I upgrade his food to a different brand, then that wouldn't fit either. Eventually he figured out how to adjust the difficulty and removed the core before chewing it to death.Toy is in the trash. Not for the serious chewer."
4,Noisy but entertaining.,"Minus one star because it's really hard/impossible to clean. One of my dogs figured it out, the other one probably figured it out too, but she didn't like the sound of the clanking around, so she'd figured out how to follow her brother around and steal the food that he gets out. I guess it's still entertaining them, so that's something. Just don't put stuff in there that can rot."
3,When it works it is amazing!,"I love my buster cubes, when I get them opened! I have a mini and large one. They are great for my dog who is very hyper and all over the place at times. It helps to keep him engaged and focused on one thing. I think this has helped long term.My issues: THEY WONT OPEN!!! After about 2 months the center piece stopped turning, on both of them! The first one, the large one, I thought it was just a fluke. A one off, nothing to write home about. So bought another one, but, then with the mini the same thing happened 2 months after using it. He was getting fed 2x a day, so 60 uses and then it jams. I have tried everything. Soaking it in hot water, banging it while trying to twist it. Nothing seems to get either open. I don't want to spend more money on getting another one for only 2 months of use. Unfortuntately, i missed the return window.The 4 months we used the busters cubes I noticed an improvement in my dogs behaviour."
1,DANGER CUBE!!!!!!!!!,"My 6 month Havanese was able to remove the insert out of this ""toy"" and had put the entire piece in his mouth before I could get to him to take it out. This cube is VERY dangerous and no matter how much you watch your puppy, owners know how quick they are.My puppy could have choked or worse on this piece. Don't risk it happening to your puppy."
1,"Terrible ""toy""","I'm sorry I bought this impossible toy. The instructions on the box do not match the product. In order to open it, you are supposed to insert your finger into hard plastic and turn. I had to put on a glove as it scratched me so much. It's very difficult to open and to close. The instructions include difficulty settings and there are none on the ball. The dog would have to bat the ball like a cat to get it to work. Waste of money!"
5,"It is just play, play, play now.....","Be aware, my spaniel will not do bathroom business IF he gets this thing outside. I bought this for my one year old cocker spaniel. He loves it. I was so surprised at how fast he learned to roll the cube; one piece of dog food fell out and he was rolling this thing across the house for more. Of course, I short his meals and feed about 1/2 his dry dog food via the cube. I have four dogs, so this thing has caused some fights. So, I ordered more and extra for my friends. Save your sanity, just get two (one to play with and one on standby)."
1,TOY CAUSED TRIP TO VET!!!,"MY GOLDEN RETRIEVER MANAGED TO CHEW THE CENTER, REMOVEABLE PIECE OFF AND GOT A PART OF IT STUCK IN HIS MOUTH.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. GET THE ATOMIC ""MOLECULE BALL"" INSTEAD. ITS SOFTER AND MORE PLIABLE AND NOT NEARLYAS DANGEROUS."
3,Very noisy and gets stuck in corners,"We lost a different kibble ball that our 16-pound Havanese loved:Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball, Large(the small size). I thought I'd try a different kibble ball as a replacement. The Buster Mini Cube is made of hard plastic and makes a lot of noise when the dog rolls it onto the linoleum kitchen floor and into chair legs, furniture, etc. It's also a cube (true to its name) and gets stuck in corners. Maybe it's because my dog first learned how to get treats out of the Omega Treat Ball, which is round and made of softer material, but he definitely didn't have as much fun with the Buster Mini Cube. He also liked to carry the Omega Treat Ball around in his mouth, and the Buster Mini Cube is too large and square for him to do so. I just purchased another Omega Treat Ball and expect it will remain his favorite kibble ball."
3,"hard to load, good but there are other products that are better","we love the idea of draining a dog's energy, stimulating their mind, giving them a fun challenge, and feeding them all in one. we have bought a lot of the products that do just that. the buster cube was one of the first products we bought. it does what it says. the only downside is loading this thing. it takes time and is kind of a pain. we have since moved on to theKong Wobbler Dog Toy,OurPets DT-10504 Smarter Toys IQ Treat Ball, 5 Inches, andPremier Busy Buddy Tug-A-Jug, Medium/Large. all of which are easier to load and accomplish the same goal."
5,Great entertainment for your dog,I live in Canada and this toy is pretty hard to find up here. I ordered it from the US because I had heard how great it was. I fill it with kibble in the morning and leave it for my dog to play with. She goes crazy for it. The difficulty setting lets me put it to max so the food doesn't all come out in the first 10 mins. I bought 2 so I could give one to my mom for her dog.
1,This cube is a pretty horrible dog toy,I have a german shepherd puppy and even he is not interested in this toy. We tried rolling it around for him and he was not amused. he ate the treats that fell out (like 10 at a time) and then left it where it was. Buyer Beware. It would be better if it was actually soft plastic but its hard and uncomfortable to play with for him. 1/2 star!
2,couldn't get the treats out,"Neither I nor my dogs could get treats out of this! I shook it and rolled it every which way, nothing came out. It wasn't easy to load, either. I tried it with tiny treats, it made no difference.I tried a few different times, we couldn't get treats out of it, so the dogs quickly lost interest. My friend said it's her dog's favorite treat dispensing toy, so I gave her another one instead of tossing mine in the trash."
1,Don't Ask Alice- Another Non-Poignant Diary,"Apparently Mark Bennett spent his childhood drawing draftsmenlike designs of the houses in his favourite sitcom. These drawings were collected in an art show and a successful book resulted. Now Mark is back with a tongue in cheek guide to etiquette as it is portrayed by TV shows. Har-de-har-har. What this book lacks in humour, it certainly makes up for in the author's frequent asides to his former alcoholism, depression and various other monkeys on his back. This book reads like a bad diary by an almost humourless comedian."
1,sparks!,"I bought this hair dryer and had it for a few months. within those few months it worked pretty well, but it wasn't any better than some of the hair dryers i have tried before. however, one day while I was using it, it started making sparks and shooting them out at my hair!! As you can imagine I was pretty alarmed and thought for a moment that my hair would catch on fire. luckily, it didn't, but my dryer went right in the garbage after that."
1,"Correct part No. on box, wrong part inside","It looks like someone returned a part and put the wrong part in the box. My problem is I didn't find it out until I'd had the part for over 2 months. I ordered a compressor, dryer and both A/C hoses at the same time. I received the compressor and dryer in a few days but the hoses went back order for months. I finally cancelled the order and paid to have the hoses custom made and that's when I found out that the dryer was the wrong part. Too late to be able to return it and no way to call and explain. Technology does have it's drawbacks."
1,One sidded trash.,"This book is a very one sidded view of negative news paper and other articles collected that sheds only a bad light on this breed of dog. This type of ""journalism"" is very dangerous."
2,Should be titled How to Search the Web using Google,"I thought the Document would give a much better in depth look at how Google works. It didn't, I only found a couple of points that I considered valuable. If you have never used any search engine in your life, you will find it of great value, otherwise keep looking. If you are using a firewall expect problems getting the doc."
2,"Very short, not very useful","I bought this on an impulse -- hey, Amazon is recommending this for me, and it's cheap -- and I didn't do my homework. I didn't read these reviews and I didn't check it out.I won't ask for my money back -- I did, after all, order it, and it's cheap. But I was very disappointed. I already knew all except 2 of the ""tricks"", and those 2 weren't very useful (one returned no info!).Unless you're a complete Google newbie, this e-book just isn't worth the time or the money. Sorry!PS: Don't assume that Amazon's recommendations are good! (I guess that's obvious...)"
3,Sacred Stone,"This is not Cussler's best work. It is a good story, lots of action, but too much jumping around. He is trying to work with too many significant characters at one time and he keeps jumping from one to the next. It becomes difficult to follow the story as there is so much disjointed material to keep track of. I like the book, I am glad I bought it, but I have read other Cussler works that were much better written."
3,Where is the Cussler part?,"Not a bad story, but during the book I got more and more convinced about the fact Pitt and Giordino would have managed everything better in only one chapter.Pity. The memory of the older (only written by) Clive Cussler books deserves better!"
3,Too many players,Too many players makes it hard to follow for short daily reading. Problable ok if you read right through it.
2,Too many characters and plots,"Ok, I bought the audio edition of this to listen to on my drive to work and back. This story almost made me fall asleep at the wheel. Too many characters or similar depths made it difficult to keep track -- in fact, I still dont know who half the characters were. Did Cussler write this book? Save your money and your sanity and get a different cussler book."
4,Sacred Sone by Clive Cussler,Good read that keeps you interested as the pages pass by. Juan and his unique crew comes up with creative solutions to get the job done. I'm on my through all the Oregon Files. Best series yet by Clive.
2,I'm really working hard to finish it but its a stuggle!,"I'm about 1/2 way there and its a struggle to finish - not Cussler's usual - maybe because there is another author and its not his? Way too many characters - I'm no dummy, but I have to keep referring to the front of the book to remind myself which one of the ""cast of characters"" he is talking about because he switches every other paragraph to a totally different scene with totally different characters. The story isn't bad - but beside the confusion of figuring out who he is talking about and where they are, there is so much extra non essential filler in it that it is hard to get involved in it. I hope it gets better as it goes along, but I doubt it!"
2,Lacks typical Cussler action.,"Cussler is a great writer. However, he missed the mark with Sacred Stone. Unlike other Cussler books, it failed to hold my attention. It lacked the typical action and suspense found in his books."
4,It's good enough.,"""Who are the Amish?"" is a good introductory book to those learning about the Amish. While this is classified as an adult book, I found its writing style and book layout to resemble that of a juvenile book. But, because of this, it's not overwhelming in its approach. Written in 1985, some Amish communities may have since changed their way of living, so if you're looking for up-to-date information, then look elsewhere. I was hoping for more information on their lives, like courtships and traditions. The pictures are far-away shorts, but in color. While this book only skims the Amish way of life, it's still interesting. I recommend."
5,WOnderful,"What more can one say, I only they would get the liscense through to making SCTV dvds!!!!!"
3,A John Candy Teaser,"While this video has some hilarious snippets of John Candy's most inspired work, it is not nearly enough to satisfy the legions of SCTV fans who remember entire episodes. I was disappointed that the video did not contain more of the classic sketches in their entirety. If it is true that there will soon be a major video release of SCTV material (oh, please, let it be so!), then save your money for that - - this teaser will only leave you frustrated."
4,"Good movie,but......","Good movie,great acting, but if you want to know the REAL story of Bumpy Johnson,Madame Queen,and the character played by the great Clarence Williams III, Bub Hewlett, and the white gangsters, read an eyewitness account. Read ""Harlem Godfather, the rap on my husband Ellsworth ""Bumpy"" Johnson. It's hard to put the book down! Also she tells the REAL story of Frank Lucas, who she says was little more than a flunky."
1,AWFULL,"I love crime movies and this is a disgrace to the genere. It is one of the most un-original, poorly written, and boringly directed movies I have ever seen. I am SHOCKED Tim Roth would ever be a part of this horrible excuse for a gangster movie. Obviously the director was watching the Untouchables and said to himself ""This movie is cool, I want to rip it off."" Honestly, it shocks me that anyone can say the title of this movie with a straight face. Anyone who likes such movies as Reservoir Dogs, Scar Face, and Goodfellas will be outraged about this film. Anyone else would probably think it was good."
4,attractive shoes at a good price,"These are inexpensive shoes, considering they have leather uppers. I've had to break them in a bit, but they fit well. I received compliments from my co-workers when I wore them."
5,One of my all times favorates,"Great shoe. Extremely comfortable and stylish as a any great casual shoe should be. I almost do not want to wear it to make last, but can't resist its comfort."
2,UNSAFE!!!,"Had this hair dryer for several years... loved it until it blew up in my hand today!!!!!!!!!!! I came on Amazon to see if this was a freak accident or happened to other consumers. I plan on contacting the company tomorrow. This is extremely dangerous, similar to other consumers experiences sparks came out of where the cord runs intot he machine, it burned my finger and could have been a lot worse! STAY AWAY!!!!!!!"
3,Lasted 3 months,"Well the price was nice for what the dryer offers, but the ""hot"" heat setting became disfunctional after 3 months of usage so naturally I was dissappointed. I think it might have to do with the rear filter getting clogged with dust.My old dryer was also a Vidal Sassoon and that lasted me well over three years because that filter actually had a removeable filter that you can take out and clean."
2,Ionic hocus pocus,"I bought this hair dryer largely for the concentrator attachment, and figured that its ionic capabilities were a bonus. Well, the concentrator attachment will not stay on the dryer, and falls off repeatedly. Also, the ""magic button"" for the ionizing really doesn't do anything as far as I can tell."
1,Exploded after 5 weeks,"I bought this hair dryer 5 weeks ago. Wasnt very happy with it. It is not strong enough for long hairs. it took me over 20 minutes to dry my hair with it and you cant feel the effect of the ionic stuff. I have tried ionic hair dryers that worked much better. so even if it was working Iwas not happy.Then it exploded this morning!!! It is still under the waranty but I have to pay for shipping + 4$ admin...Not worth it in my opinion. even if it is cheap, buy something else"
5,Blinded By the Lyrics opened my eyes,"Brent Mann's new book Blinded by the Lyrics opened my eyes and answered many of my questions that I wondered about for years. Brent provides fascinating, fun insights to many songs that may have had you asking ""What did they mean by that?"" in the past. This is a great book filled with hours of entertainment for anyone who has ever listend to music."
2,It's pretty bad,"This book isn't completely useless, though it's pretty close. I'd say that a couple of the Logical Reasonig chapters are useful, but that's about it. The games section is completely useless (get the Powerscore Logic Games Bible).Honestly, there are plenty of released real LSAC tests to practice on. You don't need this book. Whatever the merits of Kaplan's fake games, they just aren't really reflective of real ones.I didn't even look at reading comp, so maybe that is excellent. Though probably not."
3,Okay book for practice,"I am using this book as well as some real LSAC issue prep tests right now for the Feb LSAT. Sometimes these questions seem a little different from the ones in my prep tests, but not a big problems for me. I like that this book has background advice, unlke the preptests. The section on analytical reasoning is more complete then my other Kaplan book. I still need help with analytical reasoning, I am going to try the games-only books and see if they can get me about the 70% level that I score right now."
5,New writer.,"A tight,quick but never shallow little book that shows how the private eye story should be written. This is the first offering from this fellow, and I hope he has a lot more like it in him. Merck Bayern is a likeable guy with just enough flaws to make him a real person, one you'd like to shake up and down once in a while."
4,AP class,"In reference to the other reviewers, the complaints here don't seem to address the actual content of the book - $95 is expensive for a paperback, but that's why the same book can be found for $20 under Used&New.;ANYWAY, I'm a high school student who ordered this for use in my AP United States History course this fall. The book is clearly laid out, the prose is engaging, and the parts that I have read so far are comparable to(and in some instances this one surpasses) Alan Brinkley's ""American History: A Survey"", which is ranked far better. I'll probably drop another review next year after the AP exam, but it seems to be clear and concise, and the resources on the CD-rom are invaluable."
5,More than met myexpectations,"I purchased the MP3 disk version of the Nora Roberts book as a more efficient time of enjoying a good story and yet continuing my routine daily tasks. I found the disk fit into most modern CD and DVD players (although with DVD player I had to put my TV on as well (so not so good for the environment)). It was an unabridged version so the same as the actual book and the narrator was excellent. I sometimes find it a drag when the audiobooks come with 9-13 CD's that you keep on having to load into the player but this came on one CD. I also find using a computer most of the day, it allows my eyes to take a break and my ears to start working.Product was in perfect condition when it arrived. I was very satisfied with my purchase and only wished that more sellers allowed international postage."
4,Great Ending...,"By far the best in the series! I just love Cian, and I just loved Moria for him. Nora ended this Trilogy with the perfect mix of nail biting suspense and justice.All six of the circle were so well blended and the characters were so real that I actually felt like I made new friends.And for all of you who have read this don't you just love what Nora/Goddess Morrigan did for Cian?!?! Of course you saw it coming and of course that's not what usually ""happens"", but this writer can make anything believable! She did for me, and I'm oh so happy with this Happily Ever After story."
2,Disappointing,Nora Roberts is an excellent writer with realistic dialog and characters. But action novels are not her forte. This book is the climatic battle that was being set up in Morrigan's Cross and Dance of the Gods. We have waited over 800 pages for the battle between Lilith's forces and Morrigan's six heroes. And it falls flat. There is no suspence in the battle. No doubt who will win.There are better books available to read. Worth checking out from a library or borrowing from a friend but not worth shelf space in your house.
4,travel sized edition,This is a very thorough little book so put your glasses on to read it. Overall though is a lot cheaper than the big Phaidon Atlas.
2,deerskin gloves,"I was dissappointed in these gloves. I had purchased them for a gift, and was not pleased with the quality. They were marked irregular and they had a heavy lining. Had I known this I would not have ordered them, and will not order from this place again."
5,I didn't lose $95 ..like I did with Dave Clarke's Comic Book,A highly organized and very helpful companion to the other CNE5 Update Study Guides. While Dave Clarke concentrated on superheroes he eliminated some vital facts that this book filled quite nicely. Dave's book got me to within one question of passing. I skimmed ExamCram and vaulted to CNE5 overnight (literally). Several questions in the book actually showed up on the test.I immediately picked up Exam Cram for A+ certification by the same authors. It'll be my companion to the formal course. Again it may save me $95.
4,amazing.,"it's amazing as a straighten & a curler.. but i would still advice for both (seperate items) and this for travel & a space saver, if you have a small bathroom.. and of course, the price. you can't beat it!"
3,Holy Blood Holy Grail,This was a used book but arrived in very good shape. The story is very good and helpful for further study.
2,JUST DOESN'T FLOW,"Jesus, this is a HARD book to read because it is so badly structured, it reads like a 12-year old school work or something, very HARD to read, boring, does not have any rhythm, it just DOES NOT FLOW.Besides, as the other reviewers pointed, this looks a lot like a joke because the authors keep telling ""we searched this, we searched that"" and they don't really offer any real and substantive evidence on nothing. There is a lot of ""some studies claim this""... ""some studies claim that"" etc, just BAD."
1,Simply Terrible,"Like many others, I read the Da Vinci Code and this notion sparked my curiosity. I researched online and found that Holy Blood, Holy Grail was the book that fully illustrated this theory.I read it and wanted to burn it. The three people who wrote it are not historians. They enjoy molding conclusions out of evidence that is completely bogus. It is almost as if their theory was the dragon created by seeing the shape in the clouds. They mold the ""evidence"" to fit their desired beliefs.It was a terrible book. The research was poorly done and poorly presented. I discussed it with an history professor at a private university and he described the authors as ""hacks."" I do not want to pass judgment on the authors personally, but this material they published is pure garbage.I am not a Christian and am quite unbiased as far as the teachings of the Church are concerned."
4,i don't believe it,but that dont make it a bad book. there's a lot to be learned from this book even if it is disinfo. you can't make good fiction without utilizing alotta facts. i'd def recommend this book to everyone
1,Not readable,This book from this publisher concretly is very unreadable and i would not recomed anyone to buy it. Printing is very small and quality of the paper is very bad and this really gives you no posibility but to quit reading it after 15 min.The book itself i will buy again but from different publisher.
3,slow reading,held my interest but it is almost too much history to be absorbed. I was glad that I could find this through Amazon.
1,Not as good as the Da Vinci Code,"The authors have pretty much lost any credibility and any claim to scholarship by suing Dan Brown for writing a work of FICTION containing some of the authors' concepts. In essence the authors are admitting that they wrote a work of fiction and don't appreciate the competition. Had they seriously believed that their work had any merit as a scholarly historical work it seems unlikley they would be suing Brown for popularizing their research in a work of FICTION.Since the authors now seem to see themselves as competitors of Dan Brown, their work should be judged as a work of fiction. In that respect they have presented us with a book that is markedly inferior to The Da Vinci Code."
4,Disturbing.....,"I have been educated in catholic schools, am a Roman Catholic for the past 27 years of my life. I have been discouraged by my friends to read this book but let's just say that am a question mark person. I want to explore, to question especially things that matters to me as a person. Am not saying that we should fully believe in this book but it poses more of a challenge to us christians to know more about our religion. I know my faith but it doesn't hurt, I guess to wonder at times. I remember one of my religion teacher in high shool when she told us that it is better to at times doubt how your faith is than be so overly confident of its existence...this book is one of the must read material for those who are searching but don't blame the subject of the book, remember that the translation and the tradition then was through oral traditions and they are just human to commit error."
3,"Review--Holy Blood, Holy Grail","The book, Holy Blood, Holy Grail presents some interesting ideas relating to Christian beliefs. It appears to have been well researched by the authors, although some of the ideas may be supposition. It becomes very involved in family lineage of the Grail family and is sometimes difficult to follow because the family lineage is rather involved. The relationship between the grail story and Freemasonry, is an interesting development."
3,Good questions - didn't like the style.,This book asks a lot of interesting 'what-if' questions and proposes more than one far-fetched answer. Well done as such. The style is a bit too pushy and heavy for my taste. Has kind of a righteous undertone.A good read if you are already a sceptic. It is not going to convince anyone with faith to open up their mind.
1,Bloody Bad,This book did not live up to it's review or the books that have precluded it on this subject. The author was dry and lifeless and the bood read more like a boring account of a laundry list than a recount of the author's believed facts.
3,The Da Vinci Code Law Suit,It is interesting that the authors of this book recently filed a law suit against Dan Brown of the Da Vinci Code claiming a breach of copyright and plagiarism on the part of Mr. Brown.
3,FLAWED ACCOUNT OF THE BIBLE.,"Jesus Christ was a baby in Matthew when the shepards visited.But when the magi visited and he was no longer seen in the manger, he was around two years old and lived in a house.The evidence is that when Herod tried to kill all the babies to get him, he killed them all around two years old.Because the magi had told him how old Jesus Christ was at the time.The geneology however from further studies are both Josephs. Wether surnames in one and not the other, there are differences, but they refer to the same people."
1,HOKUM HOKUM HOKUM,"IF YOU BELIEVE WHAT IS WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK THEN YOU ARE VERY STUPID AS JESUS DIED AND IS RISEN AND LIVES IN ALL OF US .THE STONECUTTERS ARE THE ONES WHO WOULD INVENT A STORY LIKE THIS TO TRY AND CONFUSE PEOPLE YEKNOW WHO THEIR EMPLOYER IS DONT YOU THE MAN DOWNSTAIRSIN HELL ,THIS IS WHO CONFUSES PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD AMEN"
4,Amazing!,This book gave me a lot to think about. It is such a powerful projection of what might have been the truth in history !
1,Total TRASH - throw it in the garbage,"I couldn't even get past the first couple chapters. I'm no Bible-thumping Christian, but this is utterly ridiculous. Unless you want a big laugh, don't read this nonsense. The author wrote this book based on his opinion, not facts or even good guesses. Not only was this book unbelievably unbelievable, it was also extremely long and wordy. Go get yourself ""The Da Vinci Code""!"
2,Bwah!,"If you're looking for cheap, cheesy entertainment and wild specualation, this is it. This book has been kicking around for years and is currently back in the spotlight because ""The DaVinci Code.""Dan Brown's a much better writer of fiction than these guys and uses the ideas much more entertainingly. However, if there was ever a book that should be shelved next to Shirley McClaine, this is it."
4,Try Reading the Original,"This is the original work that inspired the Da Vinci Code. In Holy Blood, Holy Grail, Bagent and Co explore the theories touched on in Dan Brown's book. And, since they don't have to wasted ink and pages to a thriller plotline, the authors can and do dive into the subject in full detail. Personally, I don't believe this theory, and I don't consider it important anyway. What Christ brought to the world--the light he sought to uncover in every soul--can only be diminished by focusing on the possibility of his progeny. Yet, I also find anything that brings a different view of history and historic personages fascinating. Thus, the four stars.Richard Salva--author of Soul Journey from Lincoln to Lindbergh [UNABRIDGED]"
3,Pulp History,"I am struggling to find another qualification for the genre. The factual, bibliographical and contextual support for the theories put forward are very tenuous. That, in my opinion, disqualifies the book as being a serious historic study.That being said, the theories in the book are curious, and as a result, it reads more like a mystery novel of the type of ""The DaVinci Code"". It has a little more basis in reality and history that the ""Code"", but not much.For those really interested in history of the period, a good place to start would be ""The Albigensian Crusades"" by Joseph Strayer or ""The Cathars in Languedoc"" by Malcolm Barber.For those who like the pulp history of this type, they may try the books by Jean Markale, such as ""Montsegur and the Mystery of the Cathars"". The sequel to ""Holy Blood"", ""The Messianic Legacy"" is not worth the read!"
2,500 page Sleeping Pill,"The ""shocking"" revelations, assertions, and hypothesis are somewhat intriguing, but take way too long to be explained and presented in the novel.I understand that it takes extensive rhetoric and evidence in order to justify the resulting hypothesis, but there is a ton of filler in this novel that just is not interesting at all.I'm sure it's more fashionable to champion this work over more accessible stories, such as The Da Vinci Code, but I read for pleasure first, insight second. Plowing through this novel was not a labor of love."
1,Opinion of a Reader,"I'm not a Christian, so has no stake on this issue. I'm giving it only one star as it is not an easy book to read and to follow. As a reader, I found the book to be very hard going. There's a lot of names and linkages made through almost a thousand years of history. It's all very dense and impenetratable, which made the argument for the final sensational conclusion ver difficult to grasp. As such I cannot say whether or not I am convinced by the book. If you are interested in this book because of Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code, I suggest that you stick to that book because this book will most likely not add or subtract from that story."
2,Exhausting,"Having loved The Da Vinci Code I'd thought I'd delve deeper since Holy Blood Holy Grail was the inspiration for it. Big mistake. This was an absolutely exhausting book to read. It seems to go on for over 300 pages of endless genealogies before it gets to the main hypothesis. It's an extremely slow read,at times repetitive and incredibly boring. The subject was interesting but getting there will kill you. Don't do it."
4,Excellent scholarly work and a thrilling read!,"When I read _Holy Blood, Holy Grail_ a few years ago it changed my life and my entire perception of Christianity. This book is not for the dogmatic or closed minded, but for those who want an unbiased look at the Gospels and the life of Jesus."
2,Far-fethched but intriguing,"Although I found the book to be quite intriguing, I could not make the leaps in logic and reasoning which the authors seem to make with but a grain of salt. Throughout the book, I could not help but wonder whether the authors are freemasons, since every conclusion fits in rather well with freemason belief. Jesus is portrayed not as God, but as a fraud. The Bible and the Gospels are all misquoted and incorrectly analyzed. To think that Jesus had children is preposterous. Some other presumptions in the book seem to be given with no background information or substantiation. There is a period of about 500 years which the authors completely skip. This book is the best example I have encountered of trying to discredit the Christian Saviour. God have mercy on the authors' souls."
5,A Life Changer,"This book is meticulously detailed, yet a fascinating read. This is not some softheaded coffee table drivel. The people who wrote this spent years researching it. It shows. It's a conspiracy theory, and conspiracy thories have a bad name nowadays (largely because there's a conspiracy against conspiracy theories<g>), but what is politics but conspiracy? Watergate and Irangate were definite cockups but they were definitely conspiracies as well. One shouldn't have to be lumped along with X-Files style Alien Abduction freaks if you believe that conspiracies abound in the realms of politics and religion.Whether or not the genuinely shocking central conclusion has any merit, the fact remains that this book opens up and disects the accepted wisdom about the history of Europe through the ages, and does so in entertaining style.Great read. It changed my views on religion forever. I'm now *proud* to be an atheist!"
4,Good,"I think is great for the beginer, but also gives alot tips for someone who has been using Windows Vista and it is easy access on my Kindle book."
1,wonderful dancer gone bad,"This was one of the worst books ever!It was more fiction than truth. Poorly written andsuch a fantasy. No need for fiction when writing about a trulygifted and talented performer!Awful, Awful, Awful"
5,Robert Barnard's Own Favorite,"I read that this was Robert Barnard's own favorite of his detective novels, and it's not difficult to understand why. His over-the-top characters had me laughing myself silly. The other reviews cover the plot. I've never seen a better example of a sane man surrounded by madness. A riot."
2,NOT TO HAPPY WITH COT SO FAR!,I am not very happy this cot has no paperxwork accompanied with it stating name ot weight capacity in the picture it looks like a pocket for your glasses etc on the side there is not one. I have no idea if it will hold my weight 275 lbs or not lots of loose threads all over it. What is the guarantee?
4,Sturdy,"I was happy to find that the cot is very sturdy. It is skinnier than I had hoped, but I was spoiled with my last cot that didn't hold up. The only advice I have is to make sure the feet are properly attached. Mine were not and I didn't notice until I was putting it away and found the hole in my tent floor."
5,Military style cot,Good strength in the frame. Very easy to assemble. Functional. Very pleased with the cot.
1,Buy a Different edition!,"While the book itself is very good and very important in the history and philosophy of science, this edition is the absolute worst. I am convinced this ""publisher"" is breaking some sort of copyright law, as there is none of the standard information on the inside cover, and the layout is so bad that I was half convinced that I received the wrong book. I'm still not convinced I got the right one, and will be purchasing a different copy as soon as I can.The text is almost devoid of formatting, up to and including a lack of indentation, improper spacing on block quotes, improperly sized illustrations, misplaced quotation marks, etc. It's like they had someone just retype the book into a Word document, then republished and resold it on the assumption that grad students like myself will see the cost reduction and take the bait."
4,good social and political understanding,"Dowden provides the reader with a good social and political basis and evaluation of mythology in the ancient world, focusing on the ancients themselves instead of falling into the trap of modern theory and belief. If one is working on anything involving classical myth, I highly recommend reading this book at some point. You'll disagree at times, but it will make you think."
1,This is Embarrassing to Revlon,"This curling iron is just flimsy. I doesn't heat much, doesn't stay heated and the plastic handle is breaking after just a little over one week of use. Don't expect curl. Don't expect anything but returning it to the store. Revlon owns Helen of Troy. The few Helen of Troy irons needed to be returned due to shoddy manufacturing.This is too bad because I used to love Revlon curling irons. But now they have really gone down hill. A cheaply made piece of merchandise."
3,"Umm, I like it.","I'll admit that I don't know much about curling irons, but I'm pretty satisfied. I do have a few biffs about it. THe more you use it, the harder it is to curl your hair. You have to let it stand alone for a while to continue. The dial is a PAIN!! That's a big design flaw. It's so easy to turn and often while curling my hair I accidentally turn it down so I am constantly checking to see if it's still there. Luckily I use the highest setting, but if you were using another number, you'd die. Otherwise, curls fine. I definitely got my money's worth, but that's about it."
1,burned out,I bought this curling iron at walmart and the first time i used it it burned my hair and the setting was only on 4 needless to say it's a piece of junk. so now i have to pay for a haircut besides having to take a bus to take it back!!!!
1,Doesn't Curl,I'm asian but my hair is still not very thick. This curling iron doesn't work at all. No curls whatsoever.
3,Reasonable price,"The iron does work well and I plan to continue using it.Pros- auto shut off, lots of different heat settings, cord has a rotating device so that it doesn't tangle; end where you hold onto the barrel has a small ridge just before you get to the part of the iron that is hot so it clues you in that you are getting close to heat.Cons - on light is too dim and you can't tell if it is on or off easily; distance between the handle and release button is an awkward length and that makes it uncomfortable to release the hair when you want."
1,May Catch You On Fire,"I have had this curling iron for almost six months, and while the heat setting is a little frustrating, I had relatively no problems. Then, today, as I was getting ready to curl a section a hair, I heard a loud pop and saw a pretty big spark fly from the handle. I am relieved that I didn't actually have the thing in my hair when this happened. I would not recommend anyone to purchase this iron, regardless of the price."
2,its ok,"this curling iron i guess is pretty much worth the money, i have fine, very thin hair which is hard to curl regardless, but this curling iron literally didnt do anything to my hair. the size is perfect!! but my curls fall out very fast or dont even curl at all. gets hot, but not hot enough!"
3,Entertaining,"This isn't a great biography (frankly, a GREAT biography of Daley hasn't been written yet) but it is entertaining and captures the Boss during an important point of his leadership. I couldn't put it down despite its lack of sourcing, lack of objectivity, and light prose."
4,Lively and exciting read.,"Brandstetter, a gay middle-aged insurance investigator, doesn't believe a gay activist in Southern California killed a ""red-neck"" sheriff. Turning over stones, he tracks down the real murderer."
4,I Shot The Sheriff,"Once described by the Los Angeles Times as ""the most exciting and effective writer of the classic California private-eye novel working today,"" Joseph Hansen writes smart, smooth PI novels in the hard-boiled tradition--with one difference. Insurance investigator David Brandstetter is homosexual. Not so amazing these days, but something of a shocker in the 1970's when the first Brandstetter novel appeared. In book four of the critically aclaimed series, Brandstetter is investigating the murder of Police Chief Ben Orton, a man who seemed to hate everybody, and whom everybody seemed to hate. Gay activist Cliff Kerlee has been arrested, but Brandstetter isn't so sure, and if he can't be convinced, he may have to be killed..."
1,Microsoft Devotee Sacrifices Objectivity And Credibility,"""Amazing!"" was what I thought throughout this virtual love song to Microsoft. The author is naively impressed that this multi-billion dollar corporation was able to catch-up in a market that it should never have fallen behind in to begin with! He views MS's success as a matter of brains, speed and talent- and pays little attention to how the software behemoth simply was up to its old tricks: force companies to carry your product, the same way it forces, for example, Compaq to load its operating system onto every computer it sells. Writing as though describing the activities of a hard-pressed, plucky, band of computer savants, the author misses the mark. This is a company with a ""genius"" at the helm, a billion dollar war chest,and thousands of highly-skilled, technologically proficient staffers, that still managed to get caught with its browser down."
3,It really is amazing,"I have always been a fan of Jodorowsky and seen him as a visionary. I was never able to agree with those who spoke over fraught hype; however, this film left me a bit cold. There are moments of true cinematic wonder, i.e., the elephant funeral. It really is amazing how a film can connect with so many on such a deep level, then not for others. But this film, while it gets off the ground, never soared for me."
3,Pros and Cons of the Sony Dream Machine,"I've had this alarm clock for a few years and here are my thoughts:Pros:-ability to have two weekday preset alarms, and two weekend ones-simple, compact, and pleasing design-""no power no problem"" is helpful-it sets the time for you (and it is accurate)Cons:-Screen is too bright for me to sleep at night (I turn it away from the bed)-At some angles it is difficult to see the numbers-Difficult to read time from across the room (and my bedroom is not large)-Radio often does not get clear reception (this is a problem I've found with all portable radios, but one can often turn them a certain way and reception clears--not this alarm, same reception any way you place it).-I SO wish the radio had pre-set buttons, you have to use the tuner.Overall, I like this clock radio more than any other I've tried, though I'm still on the search for one that has less drawbacks."
3,"good read for poker players, gamblers","The first chapter of this book is the best fictional account of a poker game I have ever read. The remainder of the book is a fairly interesting story, giving a good look at the real world of professtional poker players and gamblers. As a work of literature it leaves much to be desired, but for its intended audience, an enjoyable read."
5,Great frizz fighter for curly girls,"I usually apply this to wet hair and dry, then apply just a little more once dry and my hair stays relatively frizz-free all day. This lightweight cream adds shine and keeps hair soft, much better than the ""crunchy"" feel you get when using gel or mousse. Would highly recommend this product!"
3,"Good product, but do not recommend this seller","This purchase was received damaged via the mail(broken lid, contents oozing out of jar). After a negative review when the vendor did not respond to my email about the shipment, he offered to replace the product at no extra cost. It's been a month now, a replacement has not been received, and again the vendor did not reply to my inquiry sent to him a week ago. I recommend the product(I've used it before), but not the seller."
4,Just a few words...,"As a 4th grade teacher, I am always on the look out for new books to spark interest. The colors used are very somber which was the mood the author wasgoing for. This is not a happy outing for the father and son, very sad. A hard thing to find a father/grandfather. I hope that this book willgive my students a feel for the mood at The Wall. A very moving book, a must read!"
5,The Wall,"This was an excellent book. I read it to my class, which is composed of learning disabled children. It was very poignant and meaningful and the children were easily able to derive the meaning from this book. I used it for Veteran's day and it was an enrichment about our soldiers and the sacrifices they make."
4,"Good, but something happens with the USB ports","We got this product, first of all, the picture showed an IBM logo (like the one in my laptop), but i received the new Thinkpad logo from Lenovo, mmm... sad for those who loved the colored ibm logo like me... sometimes one of the usb ports don't recognize my ibm mouse... sad also! be carefull when you buy products based on the picture, sometimes it doesn't reflect the final product you are going to receive!"
4,An easy to listen to recording,You have to be a Rossini fan to listen to this whole c.d. more than once a week. The orchestra sounds great on this especially on William Tell. It's fun to listen to for a pick me up every once in a while unless you're a die hard Rossini fan.
4,Works Great!,I ordered a black ink cartridge and it works just fine. It's dark and doesn't smear. Saved me a ton of money. Don't know about the color cartridge but the black is worth the money! Thanks!
3,Runs out quickly,I too agree that this ink really runs out quickly. It does not print the promised 190 pages. Of course this concern has to be taken up with HP and not the resellers but just so prospective buyers know..
5,Much Better Than Lexmark Cartridges,"After recently purchasing a new HP printer, I had to get this ink cartridge. Compared to the old Lexmark printer I had, this ink cartridge is a bargain. It only costs around $12 and so far I've printed over 200 sheets and have yet to replace the cartridge. Though less expensive than laser printers upfront, over the long run inkjet printers can be incredibly expensive because of ink cartridge costs. Thankfully, it seems that these ink cartridges will last much longer than my old Lexmark ones and with the inexpensive retail price I can buy almost three for the price of one Lexmark cartridge."
1,Don't Buy...Wasting Your Money,This sucks and doesn't work at all. It is a scam. I followed the directions to a T and it came out looking like a horror movie prop. Not at all like the cloneawilly.com website pics.
1,Totally Dissatisfied !!!,"After arriving later that expected, none of the hardware to assemble this item was in the box. Upon several calls to several different incompetent people we were told hardware could not be shipped separately. Needless to say we returned item for a full refund & were very unhappy. Would not order again."
2,poor sewing on zipper,"Although I have had Dickies in the past, the quality of the sewing around the zipper was bad. After only wearing these to work for the second time, I noticed the stitching was coming apart where the zipper cover was. It looked as if my zipper was open at the top. The pants were not small, as a matter of fact I thought a 36"" waist would have been more appropriate after I tried on the 38"", but decided to keep the 38 in case of shrinkage. Anyway, I ended up stitching the seam myself, and now all is well, the comfort and easy care of the work pants are fine."
5,COMFORTABLE!,I had bought a pair at JC Penny and returned it because it was cheaper on Amazon. Dickies is known for being stiff and hard to break into but this pair is so comfortable!
2,"Stiff, scratchy and uncomfortable","Got these for the hubs for Christmas pictures. Was looking for something inexpensive as he'd only be wearing them like once a year because he's more of a jeans guy and wears uniforms for work. He's glad he only has to wear them for a few hours, they fit well but the material is stiff and scratchy and just not comfortable, even after washing it a few times with fabric softener it's not any better."
5,"The ""Dark Navy"" is very dark.","I like these pants, I've ordered 3 pairs from Amazon now. They're durable, fit well, are comfortable, and for $20 the price is right. The style is a nice compromise between jeans and khaki pants.Beware that the 'dark navy' color is indeed very dark. In poor light you might confuse them for a pair of 'black'."
1,Disappointed,"This was the biggest disappointment I've ever had with something ordered online. The hat barely fit my nine-year-old daughter and the vest and pants were both much too small for even a size medium much less a plus sized garment. I was desparate for a costume by the time it arrived so I cut the vest up the sides and did some tailoring to make it work, the only thing that actually fit were blouse and the boot tops."
3,Not much for Video Poker,"This video was pretty good if you want to learn how slots work, but the title was deceiving. I thought it would teach you how to play video poker, and it had very little about video poker."
2,Look for something better...,"Yes, i couldn't wait to get this one, remembered it from my childhood. i think i just liked the fact that my Mom sat with me pouring over Sendak books...cause i don't think this one cuts it. The boy seems depressed, story is depressing, has a slightly funny quality, more interesting for adults than it is to my kids. I think my one child was interested based on my own interest, and she likes some of the characters a little bit. My other doesn't want me to read it again. Period. And I won't."
2,Poor Choice,"I bought this last year at Wal-Mart on clearance, just weeks later. The inside became cloudy and full of condescendation. Therefore, this watch isn't even water resistent when giving your kid a Bath. Luckily, I kept the receipt for a full refund, but would never buy this again."
4,Software compatibility issue,"If you read 'readme.txt' carefully, you'll find instructions on how to run examples under full GAUSS version. I use GAUSS 5.0 to run the examples, and no problems at all. To me, it's a good place to learn GAUSS programming."
4,Horrible cover art for a great film,"Although the cover art for ""Fever Pitch"" gives one the impression that the film is some kind of soccer sex comedy, the film is actually a touching and funny account of one man's obsession with an English soccer team and how that obsession can get in the way of real life. Adapted by Nick Hornby from his excellent memoir of the same name, the film has fine performances from an able cast that includes Colin Firth. If you are an English soccer fanatic like me, the film is a must see. An American remake was made later that uses baseball as the obsession rather than soccer, but who cares?"
4,Fever Pitch,"This movie is pretty good if you like British films which I do. Colin Firth does a great job at playing the crazed Arsenal football fan, and I have a feeling that if you also live and die for Arsenal, you'll like the film even more than I did. The only downside to the movie is that it does drag at parts, but overall, it's witty and funny."
5,Chestnuts by Harvey Reid,"I discovered Harvey Reid by accident several years ago and have purchased several of his CDs. This one does not disappoint. Clean picking, great material selection and ""natural"" sound quality give this an atmosphere of a really good private concert. Sound is not over-produced. A cast of quality sidemen make this one of my favorites for relaxing listening."
3,A Little Too Pro Hitler,"The quality and production values are good, but the script is definitely Pro-Hitler. Really that is not what I expected. I was just looking for additional documentaries after purchasing World At War. The script blames the German High Command for mistakes and not much blame is placed on Hitler himself. It also describes the attempt on Hitler's life as ""murder"" which I think is incorrect. Also the script suggests that Stalin wanted to put together a peace agreement with Germany late in the war, an idea I think shows how off base this documentary is. For the history buff it has some interesting parts, but some of the script is way too pro-Hitler."
4,when Hitler started his march to the failure?,"This documentary is good, but incomplete. This incompleteness implicitly shifts the date when Hitler started his march to the failure. It was not 1944, or 1942, or even 1941, when Hitler invaded the Soviet Union. It was September 1, 1939, when Hitler invaded Poland. Stalin badly tricked Hitler. Hitler invaded Poland and got the declaration of war from the Poland's allies. From that moment on Stalin's own military efforts were always considered fair and positive, including the occupation of the rest of Poland according to the secret paragraphs of Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. War on 2 sides is very dangerous, in most cases disastrous. And Hitler fell into this trap."
5,Great Socks,"I like these socks. They are not too thick, but very comfy. Even though I am allergic to wool, this variety is very comfy and doesn't itch. Since I can't seem to find these in local stores in my size, online is my only option."
3,Entertaining and pretty scandalous for 1958!,B-Movie about a troublemaking young lady in the bayous of Louisiana starts weak but ends with a suprisingly strong finish. Worth 85 minutes of your time.
2,Tempos are far too fast,"The sound and playing are fine, but the tempos are so fast that it sounds as if the conductor's on speed. The fast tempos completely miss the beauty of the pieces. Extremely disappointing. Unless you're a speed freak, avoid.I'd have rated this a 1 star/hate it except for the sound, the playing, and the performance of the 6th, my least favorite Brandenburg but better than some I've heard."
5,Completely satisfied,"Got this pair for my Dell Dimension 4600 desktop. It's working just fine - no conflicts, no crashes. I think they're very reasonably priced for something that is offered by Amazon.com and not some obscure 3rd party seller. I picked the gratis SuperSaver shipping and received them the very next day. Plus $0% sales tax. Adds up to a pretty unbeatable deal."
2,DOA,One module was dead on arrival. I sent both sticks back for a refund and opted to buy PNY Optima ram instead. The PNY sticks worked like a charm. Amazon made the return process a breeze.
4,superb mozart,"After hearing this particular serenade live, I just had to go and get it on cd. It is beautiful. My favourite movement is the Adagio, part III. This movement was featured in the movie Amadeus. What a genius he was."
2,"Works, but no better than the old ones.","Length:: 0:11 MinsBought these for my wife's 01 4runner. They're nice and function smoothly, but still don't have the strength to open the liftgate fully. As you can see in the video, you still have to push the gate open the last foot."
1,Great stories,"I am a Leonard fan, have 42 of his books now.The western novels and stories are great, so are the stories in this book.The atmosphere, creative plots, the characters....truely good."
3,A really cool movie!!!!,I thought this movie was really good!!! The actors did a great job. Charlie Sheen was awsome! It is worth your time. And don't you just love the name!
1,My Favorite Bad Movie,"I decided to go ahead and give the film the 1 star it deserves, but anyone who is an afficianado of bad cinema will love this movie. The talented cast never seems to realize what unholy crap they're in. And the story gets steadily more unbelievable until the final, bust-a-gut climax. Personally, I'm looking forward to this being released on DVD..."
1,Not worth your time,"It is unbelievable that a movie this poor could be made in 1997. Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen, right up there with the Jackel and Mafia!, this movie is an embarrasment for the fine group of actors who opted to take these rolls. A ridiculous plot that is easy to figure out from the beginning doesn't help things and the ""action"" sequences are nothing more than Sheen running from a trained assassin who couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with his oversized pistol and cheesy RC chopper. Before watching this movie, flip through your channels on TV and find a color striped test scene or even black and white fuzz. Watch this for 5-10 minutes and then realize this is better than Shadow Conspiracy."
1,Encore sonnet processor...,"It worked so so with the Powermac G4 sawtooth version, but kept breaking down. Had to reinstall the software several times, before it totally blue out the mother board. I tried it on some other G4's I got cheap from Ebay and it blew out the circuits, including the Sonnet Encore. I don't ever want to come close to that product again!"
2,Energy?,During a ride I would consume one of these. They taste good but are a little sticky. I don't really feel that I get any energy from them. Though I get stuff my body needs.
4,Hazzard on Greene,"Hazzard, a contemporary novelist and friend of Greene's, describes one of his vacation spots where he spent much time writing and socializing with friends. Hazzard describes the island, its history going back to Roman times, and, more recently, the European and for a large part German artists' colony in Capri since the 19th century. Her description of Greene is more anecdotal than about his life and work as a writer. Many of the habitues of the island and its cafes are well known, some of them movie stars, and the villas the rich and famous have built for themselves are architectural wonders. Hazzard marshals a great deal of detail about Greene and Capri in a well written, short book."
2,"High hopes, wilted","What a wonderful and promising subject: a talented writer telling the story of a man with a beautiful, fascinating life as he lived it on Capri, one of Italy's most delicate treasures. I longed for thoughtful description of the man and the island and the synergy they created, but couldn't get past the first two chapters. The author, who apparently knew Greene, seemingly was so proud of this that she spends multitudinous pages telling us, in dry and unreadable form, how important she was in his life (not very). She fails to draw us in with what this story could and should be: a celebration of two unique beauties. I'm returning the book, and I never do that. I won't finish the story, and I usually read even the driest of books voraciously."
4,Pretty Good,"This is a pretty decent collection of three 6 stuff, but they should have had more tracks from ""The End"" & ""Mystic Stylez"". But for the triple 6 newbie...this will do...however longtime fans may be dissapointed and will agree this could have been put together better. Peace"
1,Self-congratulation By Establishment Mouthpieces,"This is a collection of sophisticated, well-written essays by popular scholars of the pundit persuasion whose success (here and elsewhere) depends largely upon their function as mouthpieces for establishment sentiment. Not much here that would count as incisive analysis, and generally undocumented. Strong on righteous indignation, demonization and red-white-and-blue jingoism with an intellectual patina. Will be very comforting to readers who like to indulge themselves in that sort of direction through the medium of slick academic rhetoric."
2,Look elsewhere if you want user friendly software,Not user friendly. Install was ok but I have already spent hours simply trying to figure out how to change the time each slide is displayed in a slideshow project! You have to pay for tech support unless you email and then wait days for a reply!Have used Roxio and Windows movie maker in the past and they are far superior for neophytes and those wanting intuitive software!
1,Grrr,"Being sold as a recommended software package for my HD camera, I was not pleased at all to find out that it only records in standard definition and I would have to spend $90 for an upgrade to high definition. Sitting in a box in the closet, it angers me to see it."
3,"For HD, make sure you have high-end equipment!","I have the Sony HDR-HC3, so I had to get Vegas in order to edit the HD video. It is incredibly slow. I thought a new processor would help things, but it didn't. I now have the Intel Core2Duo E6600, one of the fastest available, along with 1GB of RAM, and it still hangs, doesn't respond, and is a pain to use. I wish Windows Movie Maker could import HD. It has 90% of the useful features Vegas does, but not all. As I write this review, it is in the background chugging away and unresponsive just because I zoomed out to view the whole project... not converting, not burning, just zoomed out. I'll probably have to kill the process again."
5,Many translations - this one is the best,"The Tao Te Ching is, quite obviously, a work that poses great challenges to translators. Apparently it takes much more than just a through knowledge of the language, but also many years of involvement with spiritual practices that are organized around the principles of the tao. I have read all of the ""important"" translations of this work and know something of the philosophy of the tao, and say, without reservation that Hinton's translation is the most sublime, the most poetic, and the most profound. Compare them yourself. See what you think and feel."
3,Ok,This hay can be hit or miss. Most of the time I find it's too dried out and thick which my guinea pigs don't eat and it's wasted. I will have to try the Oxbow brand.
2,The good and the bad,"I already own a kirby, but bought this just over a year ago for something a little easier to use and not quite as heavy.It does pick up very well and the filter is easy to clean. I am pretty amazed to see how much it picks up, even with frequent vacuuming.About 5 months ago, one of the cord holders snapped off. Annoying, but liveable.Then just over a month ago, the vacuum started making a horrible horrible LOUD noise with every use. As soon as you turn it on, it sounds like something it terribly wrong, but it still works. I am now shopping for a new vacuum."
2,"Was working great, till about 5 minutes ago....","well, ive owned this for about 6 months, and actually i was more or less happy with it, except the attachments (extender hose and duster in particular) keep falling off. then about 5 minutes ago, the damn thing started shaking uncontrollably, had a burning smell coming out of it, and had a large squealing sound. i keep all my equipment in great shape, i really do, i clean filters, i unwrap any string that gets caught in the brushes, and i do all this stuff before each cleaning.well, today it died, and after only 6 months.i think im going to try the roombas, thats my thought at least."
1,Another Disappointed Buyer,"Wish I had read the reviews before I purchased. All I can say is ""ditto"" to clogging, uselessness of the attachments, messy filters that need frequent cleaning, poor suction, terrible on bare floors, and after four months started smoking every time I turned it on. Throwing mine out and ordering a Hoover."
1,WORST....VACUUM....EVER,"This vacuum absolutely SUCKS! I received this as a housewarming gift from my in-laws and I swear that they are trying to punish me. It shoots dirt and kitty litter out the back side and impales in into my legs. Then when you turn it off, it dumps all the rest out on to the floor. Then you have to use a dust-buster to clean up what you just vacuumed up. If I could rate this as zero stars I would. Save your money, unless you enjoy a dirty carpet."
5,Going against the grain here...,"Well, I am going against the grain for once on Amazon, and stating this vacuum works impressively well.The difference compared to other bagless is that you have to empty the can more often (its small). If you dont, things get clogged up pretty quick, and I think thats why so many are having trouble. They arent emptying the the can and not cleaning/replacing the HEPA filter...which is VERY often forgotten!"
1,Totally unreliable - I feel ripped off,"I've had this vacuum for a few months and I feel pretty ripped off from Eureka. I even wrote in to them to express how poor of a product they have produced and I never do things like that - but this vacuum is just plain terrible.The belt breaks like it's its job, and any time you stop moving or turn it off, it leaves a large pile of dirt, dust and debris at that spot.It has also broken twice, and now the motor smokes when it runs. Do not buy this product."
2,Flowers,"Once again not a beginner's book and I am, quite a few step by step demo's but very intricate, you have to be at the advanced stage of painting for this book."
4,Pleased,"This is a nicely written book and if you like flowers, you will see how to join the arrangement together and add depth. It was very helpful. Much of the info relates to other work as well."
2,So So Book,"The book was neither good nor bad. I was interested enough to finish it, but there were no moments whern I waited breathlessly to find out what happened. The heroine was unlikable and the hero was a sweet fool. I enjoyed hearing more about Avril, whom I liked in Fortune's Bride. Sara resolves to be happy, isn't, resolves to be happy, etc, until I wanted nothing more than for her to make up her mind."
1,controls,when will these game programmers realise standerized control setups make the game more fun...do they really think i enjoy learning a new botton setup every time i change games...
2,I am disappointd in this game.,"This game is a let down. There are no checkpoints in the game, so if you achieve say 3 of 4 objectives in a mission and get bumped off you start all over from the beginning. Plus the way they laid out the controller buttons is not that good imho. You cannot go prone, R2 is the trigger where R1 is on say Call of Duty, and L3 should be sprint like on many games. It makes sense since you are using that stick that you should be able to control the sprint function with it. Also there is no ""basic training"" to walk you through the buttons, you go straight into combat. Don't buy this unless you are a fanboy of this series."
1,mark twain sam australia WA Perth,I am a major martial arts movie buff and hate to give these movies bad reviews but have no choice on this one. I guess when I brought this film thinking it was going to be good but was mistaken big time and only got it for the fact that at the time when it was purchased by me there werent any comments on this movie so i took the gamble which is obviously my own my own fault. The fight scenes are by amateur so called martial artists who dont know anything about real full contact fighting because every time a punch or kick is thrown it goes nowhere near the opponent but he still manages to hit the ground in a fake grunt of fake pain. Don't get this movie unless you have run out of other movies to purchase if I could take it back this would be going to the very last of my collection purchasing on amazon or anywhere else.
2,Unbelievable and distubing,"As has been stated before, the plot is similar to Mad Jack (which if the plot was a draw for you, Mad Jack is much better). The primary problem with this novel is the characters. Sabrina does not take action when she should and does act when she shouldn't. Although in the end I kept rooting for her to leave her husband (which tells me that the romance angle of the romance is failing). Also, Phillip is a cad and just plain horrible. Not only does he willfully hurt Sabrina, but he also abuses her physically, all without apology or repentance. The change in Phillip at the end is not enough to redeem him from the horrible things he does for three-quarters of the book. I didn't believe them in love at the end and I didn't believe that their relationship will ever work."
1,Quite Disappointed,"This was my first coulter's book. Most disappointed that I bought the book. I didn't want to judge her writing by this book so I go for another (Lord Harry) of hers. Same plot like hero nursing the naked heroin. I hope she can write better than this. I want to try another of hers, can anyone suggest?"
2,Pass it by,"Predictable- unlike her other stuff, a disappointment. Hero is a jerk (A1)and he's really not worth redeeming- yuck!"
5,Great Book - Catherine Coulter does it again!,"Catherine Coulter has done it again! I couldn't put this book down - Sabrina captures your heart and you root for Phillip to win hers. Of course, if things went along easily for the pair you would become bored quickly. Sabrina is a strong heroine who believes that she can change the way English society thinks. Phillip is a notorious rake who wants Sabrina but also his freedom and his mistress. How would you handle it? Sabrina does it very well!! Why not read it and see for yourself!"
5,Very Best of Cockburn,"I am just newly acquainted with the powerful lyrics, melodies, and beat of Bruce Cockburn. I now own 6 CD's, but this one, my first, is my favorite. All strong winning songs and 16 in total. I feel guilty enjoying his social commentary songs like ""When A Tree Falls,"" as much as I do, for they relate to our failures in dealing with the environment and other peoples as things to abuse for our benefit. I guarantee you will not be sorry you bought this CD."
2,Singles -- Not his best stuff,"I've bought every Bruce Cockburn album since his 1969 debut. His best stuff is his ballads. When he sticks to acoustic guitar and spritual moods, he is the most awesome singer-songwriter of our time. When he waxes thick on his communist politics, I wretch, big time. Apparently, I'm not the only one. The late, great Michael Hedges (Windham Hill Music) said the same thing."
3,Hmmmm,"This book is a collection of black and white photographs depicting mothers and sons through various stages of life (concentrating on childhood). Along side the photographs are heartwarming Hallmark-ish tags like, ""A son needs a mom who will make sure he does not get lost in the crowd"" or ""who will let him go when he is ready to marry."" There are 56 pages of this with some pages containing only one tag and others, up to four.The beginning of this book has a page with ""TO"" and ""FROM"" printed on it so it is obviously meant as a gift. The intro by the author was a lovely message to his mother. He stated his admiration for her never letting on what sacrifices were made to be a mother and then he goes on to remind the reader of all the things a mother does for her son in the following pages.This could be a good gift for a mom, reminding her of the joys of raising a son or an adult son to remind him how much he is and was loved."
2,disapointing,I was excited to get the additional cartridges...not sure if they were used/refurbished 2ndary to good price...but I cannot access all of the songs...they just don't load and when you type song number in...it says that there is no such selectio...emailed seller my concerns but they never even responded :(
3,Frustrating purchase,"When you purchase this item, it prompts you to purchase additonal cartridges by stating that ""customers who bought this item also purchased......"". Well I did, and although it was not that costly, these ""cartridges"" do not adapt to this product. This product only uses SD cards. The ""secret"" website mentioned to allow for downloadable music, is forever ""under construction""."
5,Awesome for the determined decorator,"Amazing pics, and recipes. Beautiful and modern. I found this book to be an asset for begginer to expert.If you are serious about cake decorating and piping techniques this book won't dissappoint. After all, anything worth doing takes patience and practice."
3,OK for some not for others.,"I would recommend reading the quick start manual that comes along with the trial version of DB2K, it's decently written and provides a lot of answers, however; true beginners will find that DB2K for dummies is a God-send in the fact that it provides a lot of reference, but keep in mind the book isn't written to well.Hope this helps and good luck!"
2,contrived,I would have given a 3star for about half way through but its so flippy this and floppy that and too long winded by half.In the end it just feels like the script writer is trying to manipulate the viewer on the premise that plenty of twists and turns regarding whodunnit will create suspense and intrigue but too many.l
4,"SEARCHER, a hint of Good things to come from Mr. Boxleitner","In Bruce Boxleitner's ""Frontier Earth: Searcher"", the story picks ups shortly after the end of the ""Frontier Earth"", the first book in this series. I write series, because it is my hope that this is a long running series. I found the first book Frontier Earth, and now the sequel Searcher to be very entertaining and well-written books. Strong character development and historical research combined with an ""Alien"" influence add a unique twist to events in the desert southwest of the late 1800s. My order arrived on a Friday afternoon, and I was finished with the book by Saturday evening. It's one of those books that you just don't want to put down until you are finished. I look forward to the next installment. (Mr. Boxleitner, please give us more!)"
3,Book was in good condition - but not as I had expected,"The paper cover was missing, and there were water spots on the hardcover. I paid more for this copy than for another one in excellent condition, but I was glad to get it as this price, too."
5,very convenient,"This item has plenty of space for the personal cd player,cd's,car kit,ear phones,ac adapter,and more."
4,Bra nybörjarbok,Boken vänder sig främst till nyblivna ormägare eller de som tänker skaffa orm.Mnga fina bilder (64 st + 33 teckningar)Den behandlar bde ormar och utrustning
5,Great set for the money,"These are a great set for a starter/college student. They were ranked by Consumer Reports as the best buy for knife sets, and with good reason.I was looking for a cheap set for my parents, to add to their collection of Wusthof Classics and Sabatiers, just for everyday use, soa s not to wear out their more expensive knives. Sure, these might not have the great German steel, but they also don't cost 10x as much, and with my handy electric knife sharpener, that's not really much of a problem.You sure get a lot of bang for your buck here; the wood block is nice, no cracks. The knives are a great deal- bolster, full tang, and forged steel, not stamped like in many cheaper blocks. The polypropylene handles felt a little rough, but overall weight balance felt good.Great deal! Highly recommended."
5,look no further and buy these,"this set of knives are the buy of a lifetime for home cooks-wonderfully balanced and extremely sharp out of the box,could easily replace any set costing hundreds of dollars more!!!!!Whether looking for replacements for an older set or making your first purchase these knives are the only ones to consider.Very happy to have found them at such a LOW price-great construction and a good warrenty-very pleased with purchase and product!!!"
2,Nice looking set...DULL!!!!!,"All of the knives are super dull! The serrated edge knives stink! Of course you can sharpen the others easily, but forget it....the bread knife tears bread better, and the steak knives feel more like steak saws....bear down! And invest in thick plates!"
2,"Redundancy at it's best.. If you have 70-291 and 70-298, you have just about the whole 70-293","I have just gone through the 70-291 and 70-298 books, and went through this one ..... and was gravely dissapointed.. I felt like I was reading the same material as I just finished.. So with that said, I believe if you are going for tests, and you already own 70-291 and 70-298 there is no reason to go out and get the MSPress of 70-293 since the material would have already been covered..."
2,What a waste of money!!!,"I bought these books to prepare for the 2003 exams. I can't believe how shallow, and poorly written these books are. The practice exams are a joke, the material and the technical coverage of the books are for novices. If you don't know how to create a user or a group in AD, then these books are for you. But, don't expect to sit the exam and pass based on these books. If you think you can use these books as reference, then think again."
5,Great!,"Wonderful, exactly what I wanted. I was afraid that it would not be what I needed, but it went above and beyond expectations."
2,Where is Major League 1?,"I only saw this moive once, and that was enough. My question is why haven't they put the first Major League on DVD? It is such a great movie and they have put 2 & 3 on DVD and they do not compare to the first one. I really hope they get their act together and put out the first movie."
5,dtriplett42,"I SEEN MAJOR LEAGUE WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT AT THE THEATRE!! I THOUGHT IT WAS HILLARIOUS!! IT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE COMEDYS!! YOU GOTTA LOVE CHARLIE SHEEN, RICK THE WILD THING VAUGHN!!! & BOB UECKER WHO DOES THE PLAY BY PLAY(HARRY DOYLE) AFTER SEEING MAJOR LEAGUE, I HAD TO PURCASE MAJOR LEAGUE 2 & 3 BACK TO THE MINORS!! YOU CAN NEVER GET ENOUGH OF THE CLEVELAND INDIANS AFTER SEEING ALL THESE MOVIES!!!!! BUY THIS DVD IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY!! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!! #1 TRIBE FAN WILLIAM."
3,Major League II / Major League: Back to the Minors (Comedy Double...,"I lked these movies, not as much as Major League, but they were intertaining. some arts were funny. all in all good movies"
2,One dimensional and boring,These books are apparently inspired by comic books and have similar depth to comics. The characters aren't very interesting or clever.
5,This is a must-have baking book,"For all the times you are strapped for time but (pick your situation): have to bring dessert to a pitch-in, bake cookies for your children's school event (at 10 o'clock the night before!), have to make something to share for the after-church reception, want a pretty dessert to serve to guests, or have a major cookie craving, you will be happy you have this book. Love it!"
3,Embassy Alligator Embossed Burgundy Genuine Leather Bible Cover.,"The Bible cover is ok, but is a little tight for my Bible although it was recommended for my size Bible. I don't think I will be able to use it at all because I had to put Bible tabs on my Bible and I'm pretty sure it won't fit at all now."
2,Disappointed in size.,"Ordered this with a giant print Bible. It appeared on the same link so you would naturally think it was the right size to be oofered with the Bible I purchased. the Bible wouldn't fit in it. It was a gift for my elderly mother and on Chrisymas, one of her gifts did not work. Not happy."
1,Not Pleased,"I don't like to be negative and tend to try to find something positive in all things for the most part. Having said that, as I opened the package an unbearable stench emitted from the product. I admired the make and style and overlooked the stench as I thought it would go away. I placed my bible in it and carried on. However, as the days past I noticed I smelled a horrible stench when I entered my room. I removed my bible from the case and it stunk also. I gave it away to my sister who washed it and left it to air dry. However, she noticed the stench intensified and permeated her car. I don't know if it was mildewed or what but even to this day my bible stinks and it has been a week. I wound up throwing it out in a dumpster far away so the stench wouldn't be around. I wasted my money and was not pleased at all."
1,Embass Alligator Embossed burgundy Genuine Leather Bible Cover,"Disappointed!Is this a Lab made leather? It's not Genuine Leather!It appears to be plastic with a repulsive odor.This item is not worth returning and difficult to rate.Needless to say, I didn""t hesitate to drive to our nearestFamily Christian Store to purchase a Real Leather Bible Cover."
2,Bible cover.,"Why does this smell so funny?? I like the carry bag and it suits my needs except, I quit using it cause of the smell. Any tips?"
2,Not so happy.,I have not had this for long I think less than 30 days and the handle has already torn. Trying to see if I can return it. I really like the style and size but it does not serve my purpose completely if I cannot use the handle.
3,You Get What You Pay For,"Don't entertain the thought of converting 1000s or even 100s of slides with this . Software is poor , manual is lacking . At best , quality of scans is just OK if the slide or neg is perfect .. and the weather is good .. your mood is not bad .. moon is full etc. etc.Top notch film scanners with ""Digital ICE"" run 500.00 to well over a 1000.00 bucks . Most of these require a SCSI interface .When I got mine it was 75.00 MSRP , It was worth it ."
2,You get what you pay,"This is not a bad item when you need to scan a couple, but its very slow and the resolution is not good. If you need it for your family photos it can be a good product, but you have to think you will need a lot of time, if I could I'll try to get one with autofeed."
1,Great for something you don't care about or is completely useless.,For some reason all the images look as though it was a printer with the ink cartridge running out. I have tried every possible combination and it all looks the same. Stay away from this thing unless you are seriously desperate.
3,"Handsome volume, but not complete","This book does not contain Burns' bawdiest works, such as ""Nine Inch Will Please a Lady."" For me, these are an essential part of the Burns canon, and should be on hand for a Burns Supper.The good news is that this is a handsome book which is otherwise quite comprehensive. One solution would be to have a copy of this on hand, as well as a copy ofThe Merry Muses of Caledonia, which contains the bawdy works left out of this collection.This is not a particularly scholarly work--the introduction is only a couple of pages long, and makes no mention of the works left out--but it is jam-packed full of poems."
4,It's a VB database programming appetizer,"I've been programming for several years. Did most of my work in MS Access, and Quick Basic before that. Access had spoiled me as far as writing small client/server programs. I was looking for something to introduce me into the world of Database Programming in VB. This book, surprisingly, does a pretty good job.I was looking for something to get me started with ADO as well as some of the newer VB technologies, such as WebClasses - a subject I knew nothing about. The book did a fairly good job. It doesn't go in depth into any of the subjects, but gives you enough to wet your appetite, which is what I hoped out of it.If you're looking for something to introduce you to the world of database programming using VB, this may be the one you want. Let's face it - compared to other programming books, you can't beat the price."
1,would not purchase again,So bad I turned it off after 15 minutes. Maybe it gets better but I will never know.In my opinion its so poor I cannot even classify it as a B flick.
1,wrong picture,"Be warned, the Light Grey pair pictured is incorrect. The light grey pair received actually includes Hot Pink!..Also beware that these shoes have a mesh wall and as such will let water in. Not great for outdoor running, unless you want your socks to get wet!.."
5,Nice shoe at right price.,I Buy them for my wife who runs on concrete. No complaints. Lasts much longer than Nike and is better looking in my opinion.
4,Knowledge is Power!!,I got this epilator a couple of months ago and waited to write my review. Here's what I discoverd:1. It was painful especially on my legs as I had never waxed them before. But now it is not bad at all as the hairs do come back in finer and you get used to it. I also use this on my underarms and bikini and it works great.2. Make sure you exfoliate!!!!I had a big problem again on my legs pretty much only with red bumps and ingrown hairs. After speaking to my mom (who is an esthitician) she recomended using a product call Tend Skin. There is also another one called Solution 2 that I found that works well also. If you exfoliate and use either one of those products and can stand some pain initially it is definately worth it to have such smooth skin with no stubble and save your time and money from having to wax. By the way you can get either one of those products on Amazon. Hope this helps..
4,One of the best,"Probably one of the best epilators out there. I used to have an Emjoi which I bought from the Sharper Image which was better and used to catch more short hairs, but this is pretty good too. The only reason that I bought this one is that I accidentally broke the other one (by plugging it into a 220V outlet). I had my first Emjoi for about 4 years so they last a good while. I don't know if this one is worth the expense though as I bought a Braun overseas and it worked about the same and was about $30. It didn't have a battery though.The main reason I posted this was to say that this DOES NOT WORK WHILE PLUGGED IN, which was surprising to me. Other than that, it's a pretty good epilator and while the extra guard and loufa-type pad are of no use to me, I bought this anyway because of my previous Emjoi which was very similar to this one.EDIT: I checked again about a week ago and it started to work while plugged in! Very weird...but I'm glad it started to work."
4,The Good And Bad From My Experience,"I was looking for a model that would take out an occasional unwanted hair or two on the face. I wouldn't recommend this one for that purpose, although it does great with legs.I had an unfortunate moment yesterday when it tried (unsuccessfully) to take a chunk out of my underarm skin. I won't use it again for that area.I actually bought 3 different models to compare. I also have one of those tiny Emjoi epilators, which works great for the face. This one didn't win my experimental competition, but it was a good product nevertheless."
2,Weak,So-so art and a weak storyline hamper what could have been a very good story...don't buy it thinking the cover is indicative of its contents as I did.
5,Warrior Princess,The Rogue Squadron: Warrior Princess is a excellent addition to the Star Wars Universe. The Rogue Squadron builds upon the characters in the novel series of the same name. The Warrior Princess brings the Rogue Squadron to a planet in an bloody civil war to place a squadron member in the throne to stop the war.
5,Martha's House,This book was my daughter's favorite story book when she was little. She loved this book. I still have the book but it was missing the first few pages. She was wanting this book for her baby. When I finally saw this I had to purchase for her. She was so excited about getting this book. Thank you so much.
3,Comparisons,"This is the same band playing the same charts as on the ""Birthday In Britain"" album. The best thing about it is we get to hear John Park do another version of his great solo work on ""Street Of Dreams."" That alone is worth the price. John was perhaps the most inovative alto man ever to play with Kenton."
1,NOT WORTH A SOU,"This is NOT ""The Artistry of Fiorenza Cossotto,"" an early studiorecording that is excellent, but only available on vinyl. It isa compilation of a few very poorly recorded ""live"" arias. Saveyour money...mine went in the trash."
5,Has worked fine for three weeks,"Fairly easy to set up, has worked great with no stoppages for three weeks now."
3,If Using For AT&T Use AT&T's Supported Devices,"Length:: 1:04 MinsI read online how this modem works with AT&T; DSL. It works and is lightweight but due to AT&T; DSL abysmal service I had to return it and cancel the service for a client.Make sure that if you use it for AT&T; DSL get a technician to take a look at it to set it up because over the phone they are really no help as they usually read off a script as this device is unsupported.In addition, this modem is not for the faint of heart, use the modem provided by AT&T; to have your headaches reduced...somewhat :D"
1,This part Sucks,"First off, Don't know WHY they require a CD-ROM Since it doesn't come with a CD.Second, Even though it says Seperate Power Unit, It Doesn't Say ANYTHING About Sold Seperately. The Unit doesn't even Work w/o PS. Why Sell it Seperately??I've bought LOTS of things where it said Power Unit Seperate and NONE Of them you haev to BUY the Power Unit Alone.(Thats Mis-Advertisement)Third, It's suppose to have either a Serial Port OR a Parallel Port, Which it doesn't. Only Ethernet.DONT BUY TIS PRODUCT. Going to Send it back because of Mis-Advertisement. OR Lack of It."
3,more of the same,"For fans of Copeland's last album, In Motion, this album will not disappoint. Copeland's music is now more accessible than ever; it's obvious when one studies the constant growth of Copeland fans. Despite the monotonous implications of the album title, Copeland has once again managed to craft a mellow rock album that does not push the limits of musical capability, yet does not disappoint, either."
3,"Great design, bad glaze","These mugs are beautifully designed. However, the set I received must have been seconds. MANY flaws in the glaze. Get these at a store so you can inspect them before purchase."
2,Oh. He's such a goodfella.,"This book is full of lies and exaggerations. It is very easy to read. Won't have to look up any of the words in a dictionary. I knew Anthony growing up, and it doesn't surprise me he became a snitch. I remeber asking some of my friends hung out with him. I never understood why. This book should be taken with a few grains of salt. He makes himself out as being such a goodfella. I wasn't surprised that he betrayed, and lied about, some of the people who were his friends, especially those he played music with. I'm sure that it wasn't hard for him to stretch the truth about his experiences. I never sold drugs, and I'm not crazy about drug dealers, but I have little respect for snitches."
1,Don't waste your money.,Simply put. It does not work. Flies return to pester the dog within the minute you use it.Cannot find old brand that did work anywhere anymore. What a pity.
4,I feel like a yeoman at the hearth,"I read some translation of Beowulf in middle school, and thought at the time that it was an interesting if archaic story. Having cut my teeth on Tolkien and Dungeons & Dragons, Beowulf didn't seem to tread much new ground for me -- even if it was composed a thousand years before.Then I picked up Ruth Lehmann's translation at an academic bookstore. Suddenly, the verse jumped off the page with a tone and rhythm that I never heard in the pedestrian translation of my early days. Was Dr. Lehmann a Scandanavian skald in a previous life?Practically, there are times when the alliterative verse becomes a bit dense and disorienting, and for that reason alone I give this less than a 5-star recommendation. If you want the clearest modern English retelling of the Beowulf story, you should probably look elsewhere. But that shouldn't deter you from the lyrical quality of this translation. It's a magical experience that transports you to a cold and ancient Denmark."
1,cheap horrible shirt,"this shirt is fit for a toilette cleanup rag! what a crappy piece of merchandise, i hate it, absolute garbage. don't buy it."
2,Not What I Thought I Was Getting,"I ordered 4 white ones to add to a set of glazed pottery pasta bowls I've had for years. Although the glaze on these is bright white, so much of the underlying pottery is visible that the overall effect seems creamy, not a true white. With the unglazed bottom, they are more casual than elegant. These are the smallest pasta bowls I've seen, which may be why so many folks find other uses. They might have been good for my husband's super-sized morning bowl of shredded wheat, but I decided to return them."
2,For history buffs only...,"As much as I enjoy reading, I was anticipating that this book would deliver the goods on the origins of the Cowboy. However, after owning it for a couple of months, I find that I am forcing myself to read it. I just cant seem to get into this intense history (I love history) as there really isnt anything that I have found to keep this story moving along. It almost feels like I have an obligation to keep reading, since I purchased it. I cant really recommend this book, and will say that the best thing about it is the cover photo."
5,"Very worthwhile book to help develop a child's sense of awe, wonder and interest!","Having grown up in a house with this book always present on the coffee table I can vouch for the fact that it is a great way to help a child broaden his/her mind and develop a love of reading non-fiction, and of geography. It is the kind of book that every child should have available to stir their blood about the wonders of the world they live in and share."
3,It's OK.....,"after reading the reviews, i was kinda skeptical, and thought that it couldnt be as bad as everyone has claimed.... i was wrong. While the actual gameplay itself is alright, the graphics are pretty bad...the first version i played was the X BOX version and it would get 5 stars...if i had an X BOX....and the loading time.... WHAT IN THE H*LL IS UP WITH THE LOADING??? i can take a short nap within the loading time.... but it's ok to play, if you can stand the graphics and loading time...my girl and i enjoy it for about an hour before our eyes hurt.. they really messed up with this one.. i'm disappointed.... and i'm usually an easy guy to please.... word of advice...rent it first and see for yourself.... i hope Top Spin 2 is better..i'm just glad i got a good deal on a brand new game for $25 instead of $45-$50 at bestbuy!!!"
3,Fun for my son,"I bought this toy for my 6 yr old son, it's what he wanted from ""Santa"" for Christmas. The item arrived in time for Christmas and made his day. The toy itself is fun for him to transform and pit against the Megatron Transformer. He's having fun with it. Thanks!"
1,Don't waste your time; buy convenience foods,"This book is seriously mis-advertised: it is for people who have never seen a kitchen, much less cooked in one. A recipe for pancakes actually tells you to buy already-mixed pancake batter. Gee, I wish -I'd- thought of that! Also, the author should check her facts: one cup of instant rice does not yield one cup of cooked rice when you follow package directions. It yields one and a half. There were a very few recipes that I had never thought of that I'll try, but I could have done the same with convenience foods. If you know what your microwave looks like, you're much better off with Desperation Dinners, which is excellent, and it doesn't insult your intelligence."
3,Average,"The mystery is pretty average, probably because this is Ms. Rendell's first of the Inspector Wexford series. The book is not long and moves briskly enough. I am game to try more of the series."
4,I never saw it coming.,"When a movie can surprise a jaded moviegoer like me, it's managed a feat beyond reason.I won't give anything away here, but check it out."
1,I see dead marketing directors!,"The ""movie"" is great, but they RUINED the DVD with endless previews/trailers that you CANNOT skip over! For that, the ""DVD"" gets zero stars if I could. If you are to jam a DVD with worthless previews that you do not have at least the decent respect of the option of skipping, then I expect a 75% deduction off the list price. Or I will never buy another DVD from this production company again. They have joined the moronic ranks of DISNEY in the DVD dept. You are hated in every sixth sense of the word."
2,"Boring and contrived, with little substance or depth","The dialogue was contrived, wordy and not believable at all--as was the story. I never really got into this movie until the end--which I thought was the best part because it was such a freaky surprise. Apparently, I'm the only one who was genuinely surprised by the ending (or the only one honest enough to admit it); or perhaps I was so bored throughout it that I just didn't pay attention to the clues others picked up on. Anyway, if you do figure out the ending early on, there's really no reason to sit through the rest of it--as there's really nothing else of substance in this movie."
1,wrong format,"This was not the format I anticipated... I understand it is a European format, and does not work with US DVD players and therefore it will not work for me."
4,Dead Man Walking,"This movie proves what everybody already knows - that Bruce Willis is dead as an actor. Renowned for his lack of thespian range, he always ends up playing the same guy in every movie. Seen in this light, casting Bruce as a walking corpse could be seen as an inspired decision. He's not likely to ruin the part by acting well. Thank you Bruce for being Bruce. We love you just the way you are, and at the end we're not too sad when we learn that you've been dead all along, because, like, we knew it, man."
5,Oh Yes,"Much has already been said about this film, so I will keep my comments brief. I loved it. It was the first film to scare me in a long time (vomit girl under the bed, yuck!). It was the first film to surprise me in a long time (great twist ending, my god!)."
1,Disney forcing you to watch previews. Don't Buy!,"This is a great movie, one of the best. But you shouldn't buy this or any other Disney product. Boycott them.When you put this DVD in, you have to watch 8 mins of previews. You can't skip them. You can't access the menu. You can't even stop your player. You have no choice but to watch the previews.If Disney isn't stopped, they will do this to other DVDs. And other companies will do it too. It has to be stopped. Boycott Disney!"
5,Expected much -- better than expected,"Yes, this film was well-acted, eerily filmed, creepily scored, and very well special-effected, but I love a movie that pulls the rug out from under you. You've experience the growing intrigue and horror as the truth of this boy's life unfolds, and feel the satisfaction of having it finally believed and resolved, and then: SLAM, BANG, WOW... The wind is knocked out of you and you have to go back and watch it all over again to see how beautifully it all hangs together. And then you have to think about it for a few days, to realize the implications of everything you've seen. A very, very worthwhile film on so many levels."
5,Totally blew my mind,"This was a totally awesome movie. All of my friends said that it was good, but I just figured...yeah, yeah. Well, I just happened to see it for sale when I picked up a new TV, so I grabbed it. I'm very glad that I did. Except for the previews at the beginning of the disc instead of an option in the DVD menu, this DVD rocked. I never saw the end coming. When it happened I was just struck dumb with amazement. If you buy any DVD this year at all, make sure it is The Sixth Sense. You will not regret it!"
4,I see dead people,Oh my God! Haley is so scared and sad! And Bruce with his quite and caring way of speaking. I didn't expect the ending and came out of the theatre as all of the other people did without saying one word!
2,Umm .. Did I Miss Something?,"I simply don't understand why everyone thinks this movie is so amazing. Going in, everyone knows the little kid sees dead people, that line was hyped so much before the movie. Hmmm ... hmm.... I wonder what might have happened to Mr. Willis' character. Needless to say, the ending becomes rather disheartening when you can figure it out at the very latest halfway through. Maybe if there was something extra or amazingly special in the ending the movie would become worth something. The acting and music and such is extremley well done, but the obvious plot doesn't leave many good memories to be had by me about this movie."
4,The Sixth Sense,I'll be brief: Great movie... but the forced viewing of the movie trailers is extraordinarily obtrusive.
5,One of my favorite movies of all time! Simply amazing!,"What can I say? I refused to see this movie for the longesttime in the theatres because of the the PG-13 rating, but when Ifolded, I was floored! I admit, there is alot of down-time, but the payoff is well worth it. I saw it with no pre-conceptions except for the PG-13 rating. I consider myself lucky because most of the viewers of the video/dvd will be expecting something. I'll be watching the Academy Awards this year for the first time since Pulp Fiction to root for this movie. CLASSIC STORYTELLING!"
5,The Sixth Sense,"I thought this movie was excellent. It was well written, well directed, and the actors were exceptional. I also thought the movie had a purpose. How do we overcome being different, how do we exercise our spiritual gifts for the benefit of helping others was the final food for thought. The surprise ending was also quite deep!"
5,whats with the previews?,"very nicley done, even without to much special effects. but was very disappointed to see mandatory previews. i hope this isnt the future of dvd."
2,I See Dead People,"One of the most over rated movies of all time- billed as the #1 all time thriller, stars Bruce Willis who meets Cole Sears. The Dr. is unprepared to know what haunts Cole. The discovery of his sixth sense leads to consequences. Though not a bad movie, it just can't live up to the hype. Don't waste your time on this wannabe iconic thriller."
3,Broken and ignored,"The Dvd came in a timely fashion, but upon opening it, I discovered it was broken.l I emailed the company three times with no answer and decided to just mail it back with a sticky note. They refunded the money pretty quickly."
3,THE TRAILERS BLOW CHUNKS!,"The pictures, sound and extras are great--but c'mon Disney! Who the hell wants to sit through those damn trailers every time--a major annoyance on an otherwise fine DVD."
5,Previews can be skipped,"Great movie, and a GREAT DVD. Just hit the next-button on your remote. Skipping the intro's is really easy!"
4,"There's a secret, ssshh!","Pretty good, hats off to mr B.W., he's just about renewed hiwself from moonlighting.I figured out the secret, but it is kind of obvious in hindsite.P.S.Who is Kizer Souxsie"
5,The Film of the 20th Century,"Wow - what can I say? A very intelligently scripted and amazingly acted film in which Bruce Willis proves that the action stereotype is just a misconception of him while he plays a child psychologist with a real sense of character. The supporting cast offer a uniformly high standard also, and with an amazingly scripted plot, make this the best film I have seen in a long, long time. If it's action you want then stay away, whereas if it is suspense, drama and plot you want order it now!Fantastic all round. Bet it makes you jump....."
5,One of the very best,"Many times I walk out of the theater thinking ""I should have waited for the DVD"". I wish I saw this one in the theater, I would have rented it again anyway. The story was tensed and very emotional. But the real impact was that after the movie, I kept thinking about it. It was well written and directed. I also enjoyed the Bonus materials, I wish there was more behind the scenes shots. The rules and clues made me want to watch it all over again. Make sure you don't see this part until you watch the movie.Other things don't bother me. With the DVD, you can just skip the previews or whatever."
3,"A Good Movie, A Bad DVD","The Sixth Sense was a good movie. I feel an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture was probably overly generous (Best Actor, however, was deserved) but nonetheless a fine film. However the trailers / previews commented on by others very much irritated me also. Yes you can forward through the various trailers as chapters but it is irksome. I have no objection to trailers / previews being a menu option, but being forced to watch them or forced to skip them is frustrating. I too will not buy another DVD from this company unless they change this policy. So then, four stars for the film, two for the DVD, for an average of three."
4,It is worth it.,"Its an excellent movie, unexpected ending which makes it an astonishing movie. It is worth purchasing,and it will be seen more than once to make sure there is no mistakes in the movie! you will know what I mean if you see it."
5,Gets better all the time,"I watched the sixth sense again last night, for the 50th time.It is a great movie that gets better all the time."
4,GREAT.. NOT A HORROR FLICK,"Some people are disappointed because they expect a horror, which this is not. Instead if you really watch this with your eyes open you will find a much deeper movie about letting go and acceptance. The twist at the end is just one element, but surely not the movie itself. M. Night's movies are never about the obvious, such as Aliens in Signs, but really about MISSING signs in life.This is not about a kid that see dead people, but about letting go of dead. The erounous coomparrision to Jabob's Ladder by a few is misguided. This is about someone already dead, Jacob's Ladder is about dying. You can't knock a movie siomply because the idea or concept has been tried before. Nothing is new in Hollywood. It is how the idea is executed."
1,A Discusting Portrayal of Horror,i've watched this movie three times hoping that on one occasion i would enjoy it since friends and family have recommended it to me several times. however it has gotten worse with each viewing. the sixth sense can be described as a shallow attempt at what hitchcock has mastered. the plot is weak and to those who really thought willis was alive throughout the movie well...i have some beachfront property for you in russia.
3,Boring movie with a great ending,"If it wasn't for the great ending, I would have given this one or two stars. I was looking forward to seeing this movie because I love these types of stories, and it had great ""word of mouth"" reviews. However, I was looking at my watch quite often throughout the movie. It was really boring, but the ending made it almost worth it."
5,great hat,"I love this hat, I was afraid of getting the wrong size because they had the choices of medium-xl so I guessed and ordered a medium and it fit great."
1,very bad envelopes,"I buy items from Amazon usually on a weekly basis and most items are outstanding. These envelopes stink , when you try to adhere the envelope there is not enough stick em to seal so each envelope you have to put a piece of tape on it."
1,This book does not help with passing exam,"I just took the exam after studying the entire book and I failed. The questions in the actual exam are ""case study"" style but the included sample test (on cd) looked nothing like it. The book is very general, contains reams of extraneous information and does not focus on the material on the test. I wish I could return it."
2,"confusing, vague, ambiguous, and difficult to read","This book uses words pretty loosely, and frequently confuses the readers. Explanations are not clear. Material is incoherent. Microsoft's proofreaders, reviewers, and/or editors did a poor job on this book. Buying it is a waste of money. Please look elsewhere."
5,"Great HousE from the German Label ""Plastic City""","This is an excellent album for House fans. Deep, thumping beats keep the sound moving. ""Plastic City"" seems to have a few good artists like this and one would be wise to check them out. If you like the pounding style of Terry Lee Brown Jr. then you should like this also. Lots of variety and even a little ""New Age"" sound thrown in."
4,good - but you need to get your own extra help,"I completely agree with Jeff - this is a great scanner for the money & I am also going to upgrade to get ICE... I think the other 2 reviewers are at the point I was initially - the manual offers no assistance in how to adjust this scanner to get the best performance. You need to go on the web and search out help from others who have had success with this (there are many) and other software (vuescan if you are comfortable with it) can help too. I use Photoshop CS after the scan to perfect the picture and I mostly deal with slides and very old negatives which are often dark. With the right settings it works well, it just takes time to play with it and find the right settings. I have not had the ""on - off"" problems in turning it on, but if you leave it, it will turn off, I think it does that to prevent overheating. Overall, great product, but slow & takes getting used too."
4,Great Book,I like this book. Very informative and interesting.Definatly gives you a better understanding of how crystals work.Highly recommend.
3,Netter's Atlas of the Human Body,"This book is useful for high school or very basic anatomy classes, not for any sort of upper level courses."
2,Not suitable for the gluten intolerant,"I was looking for gluten free recipes, and was seriously disappointed by this book. Although there are a few gluten free recipes, there is nothing that can't be obtained elsewhere. For those seeking gluten free recipes, I recommend Special Diet Solutions by Carol Fenster, or any of the books by Bette Hagman. There are too many oats, spelt, teff and kamut in this book!"
1,Doesn't stay upright!,"This duck doesn't stay upright! Seriously, what's the point of having a duck if it can only lay on it's side????"
1,Looked like used parts,"there was a nick in my balled up antenna wire, the clips that hold it to the vent bend really easy and fall out of the mount really easy. Just seems very cheaply built. the way it was packed and received made it look like it was ripped out of a car than re-sold. the reason i even gave it a 1 out of 5 is because getting just the antenna alone is $34 and to get even a cheap mount and power cord for about the same price is OK in my book."
5,Great Story,"Romance and intrigue.... Laura Gordon gives us the best of both with this exciting story. A twenty-year old murder mystery is at the core of this story. The heroine of this story witnessed her mother's murder, and a trip to Australia years later to stay with family causes her to start remembering bits and peices of the murder. But a murderer lurks nearby, one who will kill if she discovers the truth of what happened on that fateful night years ago. This story is well executed with plenty of twists and chills, as well as a handsome hero who helps her as she discovers a truth too horrible to believe. Excellent read"
1,This is not for Pagan men.,I like parts of this book. But I do agree with Old Pholophier that Bonewtis makes way to many exesues for pagan women and their bad behavior. For Pagan women to be abusive toward their brothers is to continue the abuse and what victory have you WON if you do not deal with your own demons. None. The book gives me the impression that men need to be subservent to women. But is that not what the Monotheitic relgion religons do to women? Is not Bonewits asking men to do the same thing? When does it stop? The Pagan path is a empowerment path and it comes from within. Not at the expence of others.
1,Doesn't work at all!!!,Don't waist your money!You will never get a professional manicure with this item. It works as it pleases and you may find yourself with a half manicure.
1,FRANKLY DISAPPOINTING,"I am a professional translator, and frankly I found this particular dictionary to be not up to expectations, in particular since it is extremely expensive. There are many, many construction terms that are not included. Not only that, even the Spanish translation to the Preface is full of translation and syntactical errors in Spanish, Wiley should have gotten a native speaker of Spanish to do it. If the preface is full of mistakes, the rest of the dictionary is suspect."
5,good product,"I bought this product as a gift and was very happy with it. It has no defects in the ceramic and looks great. I couldn't beat the price! If you are looking for a dutch oven like this, I would buy this one."
2,Not what I'd hoped,When I bought this lens for my camera I was hoping it would let me take closer pictures. It doesn't. I may as well not even have it on the camera. Money wasted.
1,Didn't work for me,"I tried this supplement when I had a yeast infection and it didn't noticeably improve any of my symptoms at all, despite my using it for weeks.Unfortunately, it must not work for everyone."
5,Great product--disappointed with the order!,"Love the product! Not sure what happened, but I didn't get a bottle of 120 like I paid for...the bottle was only half full if that...should ask for another bottle, but don't know how to go about it..."
3,A little disappointed...,"I have mixed feelings about this product. My 20 month old daughter plays with it alot and seems to enjoy it. My complaint is that the snaps, buttons and shapes can all be removed (and lost - and amazingly return) from the book. The plastic buckle on the buckle page was removed by my daughter within weeks. I've read reviews about how this book is great for the car and other types of travel. However, the pieces often fall to the floor of the car and most times cannot be retreived. The button page does not allow for both the button and button hole to be held, which doesn't emulate actual buttoning. The ballons that snap onto their page do not have any indication of where to line up or press the snap into place. I've already ordered another set of books where the pieces remain with the book."
2,Disappointed,"I was qutie disaoointed inthiss quiet book. There was too many repetitive pages. I had one for my child many years ago, a handmade one, and a I guess this one did not match up!! It is the first item that I have ever returned to Amazon."
4,pleaser,My 3 year old Granddaughter stopped opening her gifts as she was fascinated with this book. She was interacting with every page. I would say this was worth every penny.
2,Maybe when she's older she'll like it?,"My 20 month old wasn't able to do much of hte activities in this book, nor was my 23 month old newphew. The buttons are too hard for them to put back one, and the belt is not easy for someone of that age to do. Nor is tying anything of course. I don't understand how this is recommended for 9 months and up. So, for now I'm putting it away and hope that maybe in a year she'll like it more."
2,so so review,Its a nice looking garbage can but the automatic opening part is pretty disappointing. It does eventually open automatically if you hold something above it in just the right spot but it is pretty slow. I would not buy another one.
4,Effective after just one week,"I have osteoarthritis in my knee and am recently recovering from a tibial plateau fracture. I have recently been allowed to start putting weight on my leg and my knee was blowing up like a balloon that had little balloons popping out in places. After one week on these pills (I am only taking 2/day not the recommended 4), I noticed that my knee had stopped swelling and didn't hurt as much. The pills are quite large, but if I find I take them with a lot of fluid, I have no trouble getting them down. Would be 5 stars if not for that"
2,Hard to swallow,"These pills are huge, and the recommended dosage is 4/day. I ordered them because they claim to contain the combination of ingredients found to reduce osteoarthritis symptoms in several studies (glucosamine, chondroitin, and and manganese ascorbate). After three weeks, they've made no difference, but they may need a few months to work."
2,Out of Date,"Was published in 1990, needs to be updated, to be helpful.example: A visa is not required when travling in the Mexican state of Sonora, very helpful for travlers going to the Rocky Point etc.I purchased the book mainly for a list of RV parks, 'None Identified', in chapter 11, titled RV Parks and Services, there is a reference to another book 'Traveler's guide to 'Mexican camping' for locations and specific services at Mexican RV Parks'."
2,"Thin and Loud, but Warm","We were pretty disappointed in this item. Somehow, we trusted the color in the title ""teal"" as opposed to the color in the picture, which is a sort of rusted copper. The actual color is basically just like it looks in the picture but it is certainly not teal! Anyway, that was my bad for not believing the pic but the real reason we don't give it a good rating is because it is VERY thin and every time it moves, it sounds like a sleeping bag ... loud! It also constantly slips off of our bed, just like a sleeping bag would. The only redeeming quality - and the reason it gets two stars instead of one - is that it is pretty warm. I wouldn't buy it again, but at the price we paid ($30-ish) I wouldn't return it either. It will be nice for guests or as an emergency backup for cold weather."
2,A boring book to read over the summer.,I didn't like the book. It was boring and in poor detail. The chactors were kind of hard to picture. It was a sad story of twins. One was born sick and was favored by the parents but the other was left out and ignored. It made depressed.
2,MoLiZ rEvIeW!!!,This book was ok but nothing great. I found myself bored at many parts and probably would never have read it if it wasn't for school!!!
4,This book is interesting to all and relates well to all.,"I found this book suprisingly different. To what I thought would be a dull and dreery book, was in my life relating experences. The book is the most reveling of the small town way of life. Therefore, it is truely the most different way, for a small town person , to look on how life can be fulfilled in the most astonsing ways. I truely can relate and urge all to read this enjoyable novel. Due to its all age range relatence and acceptance. THANKS!! :)"
1,Booooooring. (yawn),An amazingly boring book. I read half of the book before putting it down. There is absolutly no action whatsoever
1,Whats the big deal?????????,I don't get what the big deal is about this book. I practically fell asleep while reading it! Sara Louise is a nothing but a whiner!
4,Jacob have I loved...,"""Jacob have I loved"" is a book which helps you find yourself. Sarah Louise (one of the characters) has a twin, Caroline. Even though they have the same amount of demonstration about how much their parents love them, Sarah thinks that no one cares about her. Because for her, Caroline is the perfect girl who has all the attention. Sarah's best friend is Call. He is a fat guy who hates Sarah's jokes. He thinks that her jokes don't make sense. One day a Captain arrived to the island with whom Sarah began to fall in love with. I think that this book teaches you that if you want to succeed in life you can do it. It doesn't matter if you think that other people are better than you. Because, no one can be good in everything. And you can succeed because you have the ability and the courage to do it."
2,Not at all what I thought,"Because it had won a Newbery Award and sounded great from the cover, I was so looking forward to this book. What a let down!"
2,A Thoughtful Book,"Let me start off with the good stuff: It's written clear, a bit of a sad tone in Katherine's writing, but it might just be her style. If you like to read books with a boatload of teen thoughts, then go ahead and enjoy this book! It's full of sadness and humble happiness.My other thoughts are: For school I had to read and 'examine' this book. Unfortunately I didn't find much to examine and what i mean is: It's a story about a girl stuck on an island and she has nothing to do, no one to love and all the good things happen to her sister. It's the story of deaths and marriages that happen on her small island. Not very exciting. Plus it's all the ""inner"" thinking of a rather plain girl.I don't know. I just like action, but not 'thoughtful' books such as these. If you're like me and enjoy fast-paced action-packed books, then I really suggest you not to read this book."
3,Alternate uses,"The products are OK. They could be a bit thicker on the plastic and a bit more durable on the padding. They are bit ""flimsier"" for the furniture and heavy items.We use them on lots of items and leave them these so we can move the heavy ottomans and recliners around. We have about 8 sets of these items some predate this brand. The early ones are not white and orange but dark beige with black inserts. These are better for the visible furniture. Perhaps Moving Men would make a version for constant use instead of just rare use."
3,Not very helpful,These do not seem to work on Hardwood floors... nothing in the manual talks about hardwood. They would probably scratch the floor. So make sure you know that this will help you before you order it.
4,Great on carpet,"I purchased these for our latest house move. I was hoping that they would allow my wife and I to arrange our furniture without having to wait for our son or son-in-law to come over - we have some large furniture. Well, they worked great on the carpet, but I have been afraid to try them on our wood floors since they are scratching pretty easily.If you have carpet, I would highly recommend them. They allow you to slide furniture without snagging or stretching your carpet."
2,not impressed,I bought these to move some furniture on carpet. Unless you are moving something light (why would you need these then??) They dont work very well.
1,NOT for HARDWOOD Floors,I just received this product and the first thing that I saw in the instructions is that it is not for floors that will scratch (like hardwood)- which is exactly what I bought it for. This was not mentioned anywhere in the product description or on the outside of the box. I will be returning it.
3,Don't use on hardwood floors,I used the furniture sliders to move a 75 gallon fish tank on a stand 3/4 empty. I was getting the carpet removed and the hardwood floor resurfaced.The sliders worked fine moving the tank with the carpet down. Moving the tank back on hardwood floors was impossible.
5,Move a little - Move a lot - These discs are slick as snot!,"I used the four large slider discs to move an 8' x 10' gambrel roofed framed shed a few feet on a cement pad (after building the mini-barn & painting it). The move placed it against the fence. It wasn't easy, but they did the job and......the slider discs are still useable though scratched up."
5,Great Multi-Purpose Charger,"Not much more to say, I don't keep multiple batteries, but it was useful for charging the pandora battery. The other abilities are little used by me, but they all function well, and for the price this is reasonable if you'll use it."
