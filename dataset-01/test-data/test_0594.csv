3,It's Okay,It's well made and all but our puppy didn't get excited about this bone and doesn't play with it anymore.
3,Bra and Panties,"Two minor bra and panty scenes in this b-grade mystery; highly unusual for mainstream American cinema of the period. First scene takes place in the opening credits and involves a woman stripping removing her dress, the second occurs about halfway through and features a undressing to her bra, panties and stockings. Three stars to be generous."
3,This does not glow in the dark,"This spider web does not glow in the dark. You must have a real black light for it to look like its glowing. With a black light, this spider web looks great. As soon as you turn off the black light, the spider web stops glowing."
1,Buyer beware! Item not as shown!,"They are trying to trick you into thinking you are getting more then you are. The picture shows a box of 12 rolls of tape. Don't believe it, you only get 1 roll of tape. It was a great price for an entire roll but a rather crappy price for just one roll. This item is very misleading. Fix the picture to reflect what is actually being sold!"
3,birthday book,"book is smaller in size than expected, would be nice to have size info. before purchase,approx. 6"" x 7"". other than that the book is nice."
1,Buyer beware!,"Would never buy from this seller again. I was told item was sent, which was not true, as I never received item. After attempts to contact seller didn't work, I contacted Amazon.com. Finally seller contacted me saying they would send item again. After a few days, I received notice from Amazon that seller canceled sale with no explanation. I see item is still for sale, but at a much higher price, so assume the price I was paying for the item was a mistake by seller, so they canceled the sale. Buyer beware!Flower Portraits Birthday Book: Dates to Remember Year After Year (Birthday Books)"
5,Fits the camera well,This is the exact camera bag that WalMart sells only cheaper. I bought this for a Canon PowerShot SX30IS the camera fits snuggly in the bag. The camera has to be put in on it's side as shown in the picture card attached to the bag. The bag has plenty of cushioning and is good quality. There is plenty of space in the bag for extra accessories. I am very please with this purchase.
2,Too small,"This bag is very nice and well constructed. However, I bought it to fit my Nikon D90 digital camera and it is simply too small."
4,Awesome!,"I'm a computer teacher, teaching children ages 2-5 and they love all these games. Another reviewer said that her children didn't know how to play the games, but we as teachers (or parents) are supposed to help them learn. For all my age groups we do lessons on the arrow keys several times in the year and the Authur game is great for reinforcing the lesson. This is a great group of programs."
2,Disappointed <sigh>,"Tired themes and characterizations plague this book and the quality of writing suffers (lack of complexity and depth). I wish Christian publishers held to higher standards for their authors. The reading level is only about 6th or 7th grade level. Hey, if you're looking for a readable novel for your preteen this might be a good one. It *is* interesting, I just want more than pablum - I would love to see excellence. Try ""Arena"" by Karen Hancock - it's closer to the mark."
5,A Must Read!!!,"I would recommend this book to everyone I come in contact with, Matter of Fact, I recommend this author to everyone I meet. I have never been dissappointed in anything Terri Blackstock rights. My daughter turned me on to her books and now I am telling other people how wonderful her books are."
2,Containers smaller than indicated!,"Ok, so these are great for organization, microwave/dishwasher safe, and relatively inexpensive... BUT, instead of 8oz/16oz/24oz containers, they are 6oz/12oz/20oz and it even says so right on the container. I'm sure you could put the larger amounts in the containers if you fill them absolutely to the brim and spill everywhere. Bottom line, these are much smaller than I was lead to believe and are en route for a return. Maybe they'd be good for someone single, but not they're not enough to hold leftovers for a family of five!"
2,Sizes are akward but nice for space,"Only giving this a 2 because I am not going to really use it do to the akward size of the containers. I guess I should have looked more carefully, but they are small and tall. Not ideal for packing food. I do appreciate that it makes the cabinet orderly."
1,Very dissatisfied,"I bought this, because i owned one before, and had it for over two years and loved it. When this came my husband opened it, and put it away. He didn't realize all the plastic was broken. So as we went through them they all had holes and were cracked. My husband is the cook in the family, and doesn't do well with returns. We had also ordered other ""Food storage"" containers, so he just decided to "" let it Go"" I would not recommend this product to anyone. Cheap and not worth the price.!!"
2,Low quality,"Wall thickness of the containers is too thin. Pushing the top causes collapsing or "" oil can"" collapse. Older versions were thicker and worked well."
2,"Cheap plastic, tops are hard to put on","Plastic brittle and cheap feeling. Tops are very hard to put on. I had purchased this product 5-10 years ago, and wanted to get itagain. We had lost some of the containers. But these do not match my previous set. Very disappointed."
1,Don't bother,"I thought I was purchasing the original item, but this is a cheap imitation. Snapping the lids on is a battle of wits and endurance! All I really wanted was more replacement containers . Would have sent them back, but by the time I paid return shipping, I'd be out $15 with nothing at all to show for it!"
5,Very Helpful. Quick & Easy Read.,"This is an excellent book for Young Women [and older women for that matter] detailing the proper attitude to take in Defending yourself against Attackers, Predators, etc. It really was a neat book to read, I'd recommend it to anyone."
3,Worked only with digital cable,"My husband and I bought this TV about 6 years ago and it was supposed to have been top of the line. It worked fine for about 3 years as long as we had the digital cable box connected to it. When my family downsized to standard, directly from the wall cable, the TV literally had to warm up before we could get a clear picture. After about 3 months of this, the picture would not show at all, but we could hear the programs.Eventually, we put the $750 Sony in storage and began using our $250 13 year old Hitachi and it has worked well for the past 2 1/2 years.I would suggest that if you choose to by this TV, make sure that it is connected to a digital cable box or satellite converter. It will make things much easier in the long term."
1,"Sony, the Quality is Gone","TV worked great for three years. Now it is dead with blinking red led light. TV repairmen picked it up, all 180 pounds. I will probably give them the set."
1,Drive began to fail within 20 days,"The product is easy to install and worked fine out of the box. You really want a USB 2.0 or Firewire connection if you are going to move lots of data.The drive I purchased from Amazon suddenly began to chatter, click and thunk in the way a drive can do shortly before crashing. This may be an unlucky 'infant mortality' case, but very disappointing nonetheless. I've been using Maxtor drives exclusively for more than a dozen years and this is the first failure."
1,Big Let Down,Thought they were cool. I'm in the business so I bought two to use as backup. Both failed in the first year. One of the replacements failed outside of the first year warranty.
2,Might be okay for a 5 year old.,"This is a very cheaply made reproduction of Malfoy's wand. Whether you buy it or not probably depends on who it's for. It would be great for a very small kid who will lose or break it, as it's cheap and made of plastic. However for anyone else who cares about detail and feel, you might as well be waving around a wooden dowel."
4,"Old, but Not Close Friends","As a devoted fan, it's been difficult for me to accept the breakup of Simon & Garfunkel after all these years. Sure, you can go see their solo concerts every now and then, but it's never the same. Thanks to Joe Morella's detailed explanations on what was actually happening between the two singers, I can now understand and accept what eventually had to happen, no matter how painful. It was particularly heartbreaking to learn that their relationship was such that Simon destroyed the sound track of Garfunkel's voice when they were initially producing ""Hearts and Bones"" as duo album. That's important to me as I still expect to live several more decades. Talking in the same vain, The Beatles Anthology (the book) served a similar purpose, as far as I'm concerned. I can now live with less frustrations."
1,piss-poor electronics,"these babies wouldn't work right in front of the transmitter! granted, i'm in a studio and there are computers and stereos everywhere, but this is no excuse for the performance of this product. not even a 2-foot range-horrible, i'm sending them back"
2,SO-SO,"I HAVE NOT RETURNED THIS UNIT YET. BUT AM THINKING ABOUT IT AND HERE IS WHY..WHEN I PLUGGED IN THE CABLES TO THE BACK OF THE REMOTE BOX THEY DID NOT SEAT TIGHTLY..THEREFORE THE SOUND CUTS IN AND OUT IF I MOVE THE BOX IN ANY WAY..I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOOD..HOWEVER, I FIND THE SOUND ACCEPTABLE TO MY EAR..."
2,Great family Christmas movie...quality comes up sorely lacking,"I eagerly anticipated sharing this 'new' classic Christmas movie with my family and young ones. And after playing the DVD, I was definately not disappointed with the story: It's definately a classic.However, I was greatly suprised at the quality (or total lack thereof) during the film itself. Not only was it dark and grainy, but parts of it changed color for a few split seconds at a time. (Kind of looked like a homemade vcr to dvd conversion).The movie is a great family friendly holiday movie....but I would definatley pass on this DVD edition unless it is an absolute favorite. It would be much better to wait on a better future edition."
3,Any real church Christmas pageant would be BETTER than this movie!,"I found this movie to be VERY disappointing... with a lackluster script and acting by children and adults alike, especially 'star' Loretta Swit. I'm guessing that the book is better than the screen adaptation. While I loved the premise of a Christmas church pageant thought to be a disaster by the unfortunate casting of 'undesirable' children... I just didn't find the movie funny or amusing, or interesting. Probably mainly because the script was bad as well as the acting. Any church member who took their video camera into their own church pageant could make a more amusing, meaningful and heartfelt movie than this one!"
5,A touching Christmas story...,A wonderful story to make a Christmas tradition with young and old alike. May it teach us to have open hearts to the less fortunate rather than spending our time buying gifts for those who already have so much.
5,Wonderful movie and such prompt service from Amazon!,We read the novel in class and as a culminating activity watched the movie and compared the movie to the novel. It was a wonderful way to conclude the lesson.
1,Env Chemist II PassBook,"Pros: I ordered online the Env. Chemist II passbook from Amazon.com and as said, it was shipped in a day. Cons: The book is NOT helpful for the Env Chemist II civil service exam. Huge sections of what was asked in the exam was not in this book. Might as well get/(borrow from library) real text books based on exam guidelines and prepare for the exam. Good Luck."
3,Stylish Sausage Stuffers,"I bought these boots to wear in a cowboy styled wedding. I loved them, especially the detailing on the strap's end pieces. The only complaint I have is that they are rather hard to put on unless one wears a thin stocking (like hose). Even with hose, they took a while to slide onto my foot.If you are used to a high heel, these are very comfortable shoes. If not, I recommend keeping a stylish (and comfortable) pair of shoes nearby."
5,smart comedy,"I saw this movie at a preview screening and was very impressed. The script is way better than most romantic comedies with ""big name stars"" out there. The story moves along well and the laughs keep on coming. You can definitely learn a thing or two about how guys think from watching this. Personally my favorite thing was Stephen Tobolowsky (""Single White Female"") as the pretentious boss constantly trying to impress with his (made-up) vocabulary."
1,Outdated reference,"I told a friend that I was installing the latest version of VMware Workstation and he offered me a copy of this book. Predictably, it was outdated and not very relevant. At times, I also found it fairly poorly written. For the complete novice (that is for some reason trying to install very outdated software) this book might be mildly useful."
3,Good buy but....,"this product was extremely comfy,, and loud. i thought they were quite awesome but a bit pricy. The sound is mind boggling when turned up all the way but when u move ur head u can hear your hair rubbing on the cloth. u might like it, u might not, ur choice"
5,Serart,"This is an unusual, but great album from Serj and Arto. It is best listened to as a complete piece, as it flows superbly and each song builds on the next. It is a mix of modern and Armenian music with some good poetry as well. The cover art is brilliant and the extra fifteen minute DVD has some artistic video footage to go with the music. An unusual but interesting album.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,Very Different,"I'm listening to it right now and I haven't listened to the whole cd yet, but, it's very different. I'm a HUGE SOAD fan. I love them and they're one of my favorite bands out there. If you're looking to buy this cd, as other reviews have said, DO NOT EXPECT A SOAD CD. It's very different, but unique in its own.I've never heard anything like it, but I definitely like it. It's very creative, so give it a chance!"
4,I liked it a lot!,True Heart is about when Tibs and Heart go looking for Joseph Laquier. Tibs wants to see him so his dream can come true. Tibs wants to be a blacksmith. Heart wants the unicorns to be safe. Joseph Laquier makes some armour for Moonsilver. I think True Heart is one of the best books I have ever read. READ THIS BOOK!
4,Lost & Found,"I had no idea that QuarterFlash made album past Back InTo The Blue.This sad but rare gem, the sad part is that this was originalysupposed to released in the US .This is what I could gather by various of outlets.was the beginning of the end of AOR.It really started with Spandau Ballet last release Heart Like The Skyas a import only?.Anyways This was marketed to Euorpean market onlySo little is known about this release.It's QuarterFlashes best release.Very soulful album, the only song that is sub par is Girl In The Wind.The rest is A+++ it's ashame! that very few people know about this.I have to say I very luckey, to have this in cd for a very cheap price.It has been re-released by marv & rindy ross check google,under quarterflash fanpage. It's lacking to songs from the originalPaint it Blue & Diamond Diamond In The Rough, but has three unreleased tracks.If you obtain this for good price then go for it.you won't be sorry."
3,Only because I like Dragonball,The only reason that I bought this is because I like Dragonball and Dragonball Z. GT is certainly not as good as its predecessors and for good reason. Mr. Toriyama was not involved in making it. The whole series simply thrives to survive off of the others and it is the least generally accepted of Dragonball series. I give it three stars only because I love the characters that Toriyama created.
2,GT,Like 99% of anime this involved sexual situations. Why is it all anime involves naked underage girls? There was a piticular scene between Pan and Doltaki that was really disturbing. I liked DBZ but this was really dark and perverted.
1,Why bother?,"This is a complete rip off, you're better off spending an extra $100 and getting a truly remastered product, dragon book, and the dragon box.If you support the Japanese version DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!It's interlaced and looks quite bad when compared to the Dragon Box!"
3,bench,"Bench seems to be well made but in ordering the""brown"" bench what arrived was a ""black"" bench. The company was prompt in swapping the bench for the correct color.The seat cover is not leather.The black seat was a thin plastic cover that stretched easily. It looked ok. But probably would not last long.The brown (very dark and smooth) was a bit more durable."
3,Ok...but.....,"Despite being an avid Doors fan, I have to confess this DVD has it's interesting moments, but there's nothing here I feel compelled to watch over and over again.Given the subject matter this is a bit of a disappointment. I'd put this in the category of a DVD to maybe see once, but certainly nothing here compelling enough to own for multiple viewings."
5,MyPod for Senseo,This is really great - it makes only a single cup but of any kind of coffee - you can get it at your local walmart without paying shipping! If you have a senseo coffee maker it is a must have
2,Perhaps a Design Problem,"I guess I am a slow learner. I have bought two now. Unfortunately, after two or three weeks of use the bottom of the filter begins to bulge and break away. I use the recommended amount of coffee and a filter. I do enjoy the coffee it makes when it is working correctly. I have not found a stronger metal alternative filter for the Black and Decker."
3,Missing Parts,"Item was missing parts displayed on the Amazon site as well as in the installation manual. Like others have mentioned, I didnt need the two knob face plate so hopefully the install will not be affected.Cutting off the tabs that were not needed was not an easy chore using a box cutter, which was the tool the instructions advised to use.I noticed on the sellers website that the item model is shown with the exact components it contains, I guess its easier to use one picture to cover several models rather than use the exact photo for each item."
1,waste of my money,"Simple start is not dependable - do not buy it. New last Christmas, it charged OK and went into the trunk of the car. Needed it today, about 12 months later, and it had no charge in it, dead. I went to recharge it. Pushed recharge button and light turned green and Shrill beeping sound started. And wouldn't stop. My dog wasn't too happy about the sound. So my experience is that this product never worked properly and is a total waste of money. Too bad for Black and Decker that their name is on it. Buy one of their battery powered power tools after this experience? I don't think so...."
5,Black & Decker Simple Start,I haven't needed to use this product but feel secure knowing it is in the trunk of my car in case my battery fails. Great product from a good company.
1,POS,"Another one cursed with the incessant, extremely shill beeping. Read the directions 20 times.This thing is expensive garbage.Black & Decker blew it."
1,Don't rely on this device.,"What a great idea, I thought. Well, today was the day I finally had the ""chance"" to use it. I left my headlights on and was relieved to know that I could just pull out this device and be on my way. No such luck! I followed the instructions exactly and IT SIMPLY DID NOT WORK. Nada, zip. Why is this product still on the market? And why did the latest Consumer Reports just report it as one model that actually works. It doesn't."
2,Missed the mark.,"Bought this to jump my vehicle, a light SUV. After repeated recharges and attempts the best it could do was give enough power to turn over once, but no start.This MIGHT work if you have a compact car. Otherwise skip it and drop a little extra on something that has a bit more kick."
4,Works JUST as described,"On a cold snowy day, the Simple Start really made my day. My car refused to start and without having to open the hood, I charged the battery. Although the TV commercial implied only a few minute wait time, the product literature said about 15 minutes. That is what it took. When it started to beep at me, I knew I was ready to try to start my car. It started with no trouble at all! As recommended, I then charged the charger. It only took about 6 hours to charge back up to full strength. The safety and security of this device (no power cords in the snow, no opening the engine, no jumper cables) makes it well worth the money!"
1,It works well once,"tried to start a car with a dead battery once and it worked well, however that was a one time episode. The other 5 times it was worthless. I felt, I at least had a good DC power source, but I needed to use a 12 volt spot light to find a lost dog in the woods and it the light lasted 1 minute before the annoying beep indicated my time was up and out the light went. We still found our terrified little dog, but no thanks to B&D."
1,"Great for charging a cell phone, but jump starting a car?","This product has never worked even on my small sized Miata battery. Regular jump starting allowed my car to start right up, but this device, used as instructed, fails to build up enough of a charge to restart vehicle. So, great for cell phones, but I need something with a lot more punch. And without the 15 minute wait time while it charges, or doesn't charge, your battery."
5,RJM,Have not had the privlege to put this into use as of yet. Great idea for jump starting your car. Could use two things: Instructions should give you a better idea on an approximate time required to chrge the batter the first time and the power supply could use a AC outlet.
1,Won't charge - defective and needed in emergency,"I picked this up because my truck wouldn't start due to cold weather and I killed the battery trying to get it to turn over. I absolutely needed this product to work so I wouldn't miss another day of work (where I'm at it's drive in or nothing). Had the same problem as a lot of folks, and on the B&D; website the only help in their 'FAQ' said to just turn it on and off a bunch of times til it started charging.I'm taking this back tomorrow and will never recommend this product line (made by Vector for B&D;) to anyone, ever."
1,Great concept - Poor execution,"I purchased three of these items for each member of my family. These are small compact units and not too heavy. My feeling was that my wife could handle the Simple Start system with ease should the need ever arise. Unfortunately, within one year all three Black & Decker Battery Boosters fail to hold a charge. I wrote to the Black & Decker company regarding this situation and never received the courtesy of a reply. In conclusion: a great concept with poor execution in material longevity and product customer service."
2,"First a dud, then a lemon...","I ordered this because it looked easy and there were a lot of good reviews, but the first one arrived and wouldn't take a charge. Just an ear-piercing sound when plugged in. Per rep at B&D 1-800 number, they get a lot of that with these units sold through Amazon. Soooo, I decided to try again and sent it back for replacement, which Amazon got to me right away. This one at least seemed to take a charge, and there was no shrieking, but, alas, it didn't do a thing for my dead battery and had to go back. I definitely wouldn't recommend this product, especially not as an online purchase."
1,Battery goes bad,"I've had this a few years. Apparently it isn't compatible with my car, so I never got it to work to start my car. I kept it as an emergency light, but it no longer charges despite little use. Apparently the battery died and can't be replaced, and Black and Decker doesn't provide any support on this model anymore."
2,Batteries don't last,"It seemed like a good idea at the time. I never actually started a car with this. By the time I needed it, the internal batteries wouldn't hold a charge.Update: Upon calling Black & Decker for service, I learned that Black & Decker has sold this product line to a company called Baccus Global, which is selling automotive products like this one under the Black & Decker and Stanley brand names. I corresponded with Baccus via email, and they said they have no parts or inventory on this item, so it cannot be fixed. The item itself has been discontinued."
1,Won't take a charge...,"I bought two of these for Christmas presents a year ago.... one for a friend and of course, a present for me. I gave the one away, but never opened the one I kept until this week. I plugged in the AC charger and pushed the charge button. Instead of the unit beeping once, it continued to beep non-stop, so I took it out to the garage to charge. About three hours later it finally stopped beeping. After 25 hrs of charging, instead of the charging light becoming solid, indicating it is fully charged, the light kept blinking which indicates it is not fully charged. This may have be due to the fact that it sat on the shelf so long without being charged, the battery is no longer any good. In reading these reviews, it seems as though the quality of this product is very inconsistant. You either get one that works great, or you waste $50."
1,"Black and Decker, But ""Made in China""","Fortunately, I never had to use this thing to actually start my Jeep. Given the other reviews, it looks like I would still be stuck in the middle of nowhere. My problem with this thing is that it mysteriously won't charge. Oh, it will connect to both a 120-volt and a 12-volt power supply. It needs the power in order to make the incessant shrieking beeps that it likes to make! However, it won't charge and I tried everything in the instruction manual... it is useless. Then I read the label on the back: ""Made in China""... explains everything."
5,Works as advertized,ordering and delivery all went very well. I have used it once and it work great. Great price for the comfort of mind that i get knowing that my wife will not have to ask strangers to help her start her car next time she leaves her lights on. (which happends a lot) Suggest evert one have at least one of these. Much better than jumper cables
1,Won't Recharge: My Worst Amazon Purchase Ever,"Loved the idea of being able to recharge without jumper cables, so I bought one for myself and a friend. Tried to use it once to charge her car: didn't work. Now neither one will recharge. A total waste of money and I will never buy anything from Black & Decker again!"
2,Non-starter,"I've had this starter for a couple years now, and the thing does not hold a charge. The only time I've successfully been able to use it is to charge a cell phone using my car charger. Every time I've needed it to start an actual car, it's been dead despite spending most of its time plugged in in the house."
5,"This Really IS 'The Best!""","The recent death of Boots Randolph reminded me of how much I love saxaphone albums, particularly Boots and Ace Cannon, but for some reason I had no CDs of either musician. When I received the albums I ordered, I expected to prefer Boots to Ace but it's just the reverse. ""The Best of Ace Cannon"" is fabulous - my current favorite CD by far."
3,Comfortable Couch,This couch is okay but the quality of the material could be better. And it is sort of small to fully stretch out and relax.
1,disservice to a great dancer,"This dvd makes it impossible to watch the work of a great, magnificent dancer. You barely get to see him dance. There is no image on the screen for more than a few seconds, mostly less - so that you have a headache within 10 minutes of trying to watch. The film-maker needs to go back to film-maker kindergarten! What a shame."
1,Terrible editing ruins a great show,"The editing of this dvd is terrble, with multiple camera shots of every dance move spliced together, making it a headache and very unpleasant to watch. What happened to the dance filming in the days of Fred Astaire, when dances were shot full screen. The editing ruined what would otherwise have been a very good dance dvd."
5,Live at the Royal Albert Hall,"This DVD is a fascinating example of the art of flamenco dancing. Joaquin Cortes is brilliant, and in my opinion, the best flamenco dancer in the world. He is so passionate about what he does, and that radiates in each and every performance. A must see!"
2,Crazy Price,I have the Frieza Saga Book and it has 97 black and white pages it's an okay sourcebook it has stats for all the Z fighters and Frieza and his goons and rules for super saiyan but no where near worth 50.00 or more dollars the rules are okay I mean there are better RPG books out there worth the money but if your a DBZ diehard fan then go for it but the price is crazy.
5,Low Carb Comfort Food,"My wife and I have been on and off the low carb way of eating for the last several years -- start low carbing, the pounds melt away, then boredom sets in. This cookbook is the antidote to low carb boredom. Most of the recipes are easy to prepare, fairly quick and mighty tasty. We have 7 or 8 lowcarb cookbooks on the shelf. This is always the first one I reach for when I want to eat something real."
3,Not thrilled with the recipes so far...,"I have made several of the recipes in this book and I'm not impressed so far. The cheesecakes were not great--they were quite dry and tasteless (the baking time was probably overstated). The chocolate silk pie was awful--the bitterness of the chocolate could not be tamed by the artificial sweetener. I tried Splenda in one and a liquid sweetener in another, and both tasted bitter and disgustingly sweet at the same time. The usual dessert recipes are in there (I'm getting tired of seeing chocolate mousse with the usual cream, cocoa and vanilla). I am giving this book a 3, however, because I haven't tried the first or main course recipes yet, so that may be a saving grace for the book."
5,A varied menu is a low-carb dieter's greatest resource!,"I bought the first edition of this cookbook and liked it a lot, so I ordered this revised edition and could not be more pleased! Lauri has a terrific imagination and a flair for creative cooking - an absolute necessity for low-carbing. Easy to follow instructions, ""normal"" ingredients and reasonable carb allowances. Don't miss out on this one!"
1,Will not buy the book -,Note to the writer - when people buy a cookbook online we need to see more that your table of contents. Considering the specific topic - I can't buy a book that I can't at least see a couple recipes and determine if I like the style of cooking.Too bad for Lauri!
3,"eggs, eggs everywhere","The lunch and dinner recipes were good, but the breakfast, just about all of them were eggs!! I don't care how you make them, eggs are eggs, you can put salsa in them, make an omelet, but they are still eggs. I got fed up (excuse the pun) with nothing but eggs, everyday. How about other recipes, like pancakes, using soy flour? Sometimes I had to cheat and eat ceral because of the small amount of breakfast recipes."
1,NANO DOESN'T CONNECT,"I must have gotten a badly manufactured bunch (I replaced the first Nano TuneDeck sent to me). The base is not configured for the Nano. The connector in the base is about an eighth inch too far to center. Sending this one back as well. It's a nice idea though, but I can't even use the thing as others seem to have done. Not trying again either."
2,"Good, but could have been better","Kear has done fairly well over all, but several of her reference sections are incomplete. Also, she seems to go out of her way to print reviews of Miss Moorehead's films/TV appearances that are negative and in some cases downright insulting. My overall impression is that Kear, as she did her research, began (for whatever reason) to dislike Miss Moorehead. In spite of these glaring and obvious flaws, there is some good information here, I just wish it had been put together by someone with a little more repect and admiration for her esteemed subject."
2,punishment?,"It seems strange to write a book in favor of punishment when every ABA textbook explains nicely why punishment should only be used in special, extreme cases. Also, in the first chapter of the book (which can be seen on Contextpress.com), the Head Start results seem to be from the teaching strategy, not the time-out. Remember, time-out is a strategy to decrease behavior and cannot teach problem solving strategies."
1,shame on Mr Rehmus,"Without a slightest doubt this translation is the worst among all existing translations in European languages. French version, for instance, is far from perfect, but it is thousand times better than this book. The English translator non just did a very poor job, but distorted meaning of many statements in the original text. He chopped the brilliant phrases of Evola, oversimplified and flattened them, totally neglected few hundred references and quotations. This translation is a crime against one of the best books on hermeticism in XX century."
3,A pretty good collection of some of Marriotts work.,Not to bad a collection of some of Steve's songs. A good mix from from different parts of his career.
3,"Good anime, however, fight scenes lacking?","So, I just finished the whole series. Storyline and artwork was great. However, my main problem with this particular series was, in every episode, the fight scene either had to cut away, or would end in 15-30 seconds. It's like the artists got lazy on fight scenes and worked around it. Don't get me wrong, I love a good story line. But I'm pretty sure a lot of the anime fans out there love the fight scenes even more. And that's what really bugged me about this purchase. Potentially this anime could have been great. Having played Devil May Cry, easily gives you an idea on how intense fight scenes should have gone in this anime. Sadly, the fight scenes are pretty disappointing. Disappointing enough for me to actually make a review about it. Everything else was good though."
4,not a fan of golden age but,"I never cared for Golden Age comics. The few I saw seemed crude and simplistic compared to the Silver and Bronze age stuff I grew up with. I picked up this volume not expecting very much and was pleasantly surprised.There is a surprising amount of macabre to Simon & Kirby's villains, not just the classic Red Skull, but ""Chess-board of Death,"" ""the Hunchback of Hollywood"" and ""the Wax Statue that struck Death.""For once, the backup features weren't just filling up pages. I was genuinely interested in the caveboy Tuk and Hurricane. I hope they continued those features when I purchase volume 2.Even the text pages were better than usual (not that that's saying much!).If you're at all interested in the character or in golden age comics, you will probably enjoy this book."
3,SHODDY BINDING,"I have to agree with the other reviewers that content-wise, this book is wonderful! Great art, fun stories from the Golden Age and a great hero. But...I have to say I am disappointed in the production quality of the book and Marvel's lack of response when I brought the complaint to their attention. I had read the book maybe three times and store it upright in a bookshelf with other archive editions, both DC and Marvel. I take very good care of my books and do not overextend the spine, etc. But after only a few months, the covers separated from the pages. It appears the glue used to bind the pages to the covers simply let go. I wrote to Marvel and never received so much as an acknowledgement of my concern. I doubt I am the only one who has experienced this problem, so be advised. Great book-shame on Marvel!"
1,Different Best Of?,"I have an Eddy Raven CD titled ""The Best of Eddy Raven."" Same songs as the ""Best of Eddy Raven,"" but the cover art is different (he is much younger) and the songs are in a different order (i.e. I Got Mexico is 1 and Joe Knows How to Live is 6 etc). I think mine has the original versions of the songs also. All I can say is maybe this is one time you are better off going to the record store."
4,"For Newcomers, Not Experienced Bloggers","Treats numerous topics in blogging, such as RSS, monetizing with ads, and promoting the blog, with a short, informative overview. The sections are brief, no in-depth coverage of topics. A good start for someone thinking of blogging professionally, or just beginning and needing to learn the ropes quickly. Those with more experience and knowledge will find it shallow."
2,Little off,"Bought a pair to replace the hood supports on a Volvo. One end fit perfectly, the other end.. I had to modify to fit correctly. They were to small. If your looking for a direct replacement double check the application for use"
3,CARDCAPTOR SAKURA.,"In the movie, Sakura wins a trip to Hong Kong. On her trip strange thhings happen... Sakura keeps on having a dream about a woman who keeps on asking for Clow Reed, and strange birds keep on watching Sakura and her friends. Sounds like a good plot right?Well... the story really doesn't have a good plot once you start watching it. And the movie takes a long time before getting to an action part. The ending is kind of strange.. You might want to consider renting this tape before buying it. Also, their voices(english) are not that good. They sound like adults trying to be 4 graders. Their voice actresses/actors gave me a headache and my whole family."
5,A Movie you can't miss!!!,"Sakura wins a trip to Hong Kong and invites Tomoyo, Yukito and Touya to go with her. When she gets to Hong Kong she finds that Syaoran and Meiling where in Hong Kong too.(Visiting their family)Sakura meets Syaoran's family, but there is a strange force that is after Sakura. I'm not going to tell you all about it because I don't want to give away the ending... But it's a happy one :)"
3,Cardcaptor Sakura-The Movie,"Good animated Japanese film, still recommend reviewing these types of films for adult content before giving to children"
5,excellent expansion of the series,"Sakura, her brother, Yukito, her best friend and Kero go on holiday to Hong Kong when Sakura wins a prize. Of course they meet up with with the entire Li clan whose home is Hong Kong. While there they learn a valuable lesson: magic lasts, its effects last. The animation is quality and the soundtrack is better than the series. Even Kero is less annoying. I think it moves the plot along quite nicely and sets things up well for the third season of the series. Very empowering for girls, too."
5,"The Beatles, The Bible, and Bodega Bay","This was one of those books, that you read once, and cherish! Ken has a very beautiful heart, and a way of sharing about his life with the Beatles, that is both funny, and thought provoking! If you are sorry for reading it, you are missing out on something very important in your life, and if you are glad you've read it, then you've received a wonderful blessing! I highly recommend this book!"
1,these headpones are worthless,I have been completely impressed with every Sony product I've ever owned until purchasing these headphones. The fit is so loose and sloppy that it seems they're designed only for someone with a massive head or very big hair. Signal dropout in the form of a annoying click occours every time you move more than 5 steps and every couple of minutes if you are stationary. I find the sound quality acceptable but only when it's loud enough to drown out the hiss. I don't know if other brands are any better but I can't imagine how they could be any worse.
1,Very disappointed in sound,"I had high hopes for these, considering all the hype regarding the dynamic range. The sound was very disappointing and anything over half volume was very distorted. Also, the phones could not handle any bass at all. I bought these to listen to at work and found myself turning the treble all the way up and bass all the way down just to get a somewhat clear signal. I was rerplacing a set of MDR200 headphones with these, but the 200s are a 100 times better in sound quality and volume. Returned the cordless and do not recommend to anyone."
4,review of the wireless headphones MDR-RF950RK,"The sound is very good. I can hear everywhere: in my basement, outside and so on. The only comment is that sometimes when I turned my head, the sound disappeared for a 1/10 of second. But it is possible that I did not tune them well. I compared this product to another, which you can by in RADIOSHAK. SONY is much better. Especially I like their headphones, because they are very comfortable."
3,Wen Tea Tree Cleanser,It works well enough. I still need to use a clarifying shampoo. I don't seem to need as much as the directions call for. I think when it is empty I won't get it again.
2,Wen,"Tried it a few times and was a bit greasy for my hair. Did not use that much product because my hair was going to feel heavy the next day. Used it once a week and then went back to my old shampoo and conditioner,tried it and did not like it."
1,Ripped off..,"I watched the infomercial on TV and really bought into the hype. I just dished out $28 (during our bad economy) hoping to found something worthwhile. I have used this for a month and each time I use it, my hair is frizzier and ""dirty-looking"" than usual. I was hoping for smooth, shiny hair like they advertised. I think i have better luck with my normal organic shampoo mixed with natural oils. Will not repurchase."
4,It's a love hate relationship,The title says it all.This product is WAY to pricey for me. Its not even the oz of a reg shampoo bottle.On the otherhand it makes my hair feel amazing I love the texture it leaves my hair feeling. I wish it were alittle more cheaper. Or atleast have more oz.
1,"Definitely not a ""Wen girl""","I have very fragile hair - it's thin, frizzy, and prone to breakage. I was up one night watching the Wen infomercial and said ""oh, why not. I have nothing to lose (but a lot of money)"". I chose the Tea Tree cleansing conditioner because I have a very dry scalp in the summertime and from the reviews I read, the Tea Tree is good for dry scalp.My hair has never looked worse since using Wen. It's now feels like straw and is very frizzy. I followed the directions to a T, so nobody can say I ""didn't do it right"". Although it feels good while on my hair/scalp (nice and tingly), the result is less than desirable.I'm going back to normal shampoos and conditioners now. Wen was not the miracle I was hoping for."
3,OK,"Using it as instructed made my hair feel heavy and hard. I tried using half the amount only about 3 days week and it works much better that way. Also, I have noticed that my hair is very soft and bouncy the day I use this cleanser, but when I go to bed and wake up the next morning, it is very flat and feels a bit oily. I don't have this issue with regular shampoos. So if you don't like to wash your hair everyday, this cleaner may not work for you. I will use up the bottle that I bought, but will not buy it anymore. Don't think I wasted my money, but don't think it was worth it either."
2,Dried me out,"The product says that it is supposed to work well at keeping your hair healthy and moisturized, but it dried out my hair and made it really difficult to style. I gave it two instead of one because it smells really good."
1,no,This did make my hair feel soft. I did not change its appearance. My hair has continued to be dry and frizzy after using this product.
3,Great product but not cost efficient.,"This conditioner is great and does everything it claims and everything the reviewers have raved about. However, I bought it 2 weeks ago and have already used it all. The directions tell you to use an excessive amount each time. I have long hair and the directions say to use 30-40 pumps for long or thick hair. I cannot justify spending this much on conditioner for such limited use. You can use it as a leave in conditioner, however, so I may do that in the future."
4,Good Mat Good Price,"This Chipping mat works great for my purposes. I use it in the house with practice balls and I also use it out in the yard with my driver and net. The rubber plug does allow you to use wooden tees which is nice because you can adjust the height. I really like this mat and I have not had any problems with it. Unfortunately, my cats like it as well but it stays put on a wood floor and I can drive outside. Good value."
1,The Piano,"What i hear on the cd is not the way I heard it on the radio, there mut be a better promo cut played on the radio then that is produced for the cd for open market sales. Disappointed!!!"
2,Back to the Future. . . .AGAIN!,"Back to the Future Part III (1990) **1/2 |C--118 min.| D: Robert Zemeckis. Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Mary Steenburgen, Thomas F. Wilson, Lea Thompson, ZZ Top. PGJust so-so third installment in the sci-fi series. It has some fun and wild moments, but the setting in the Wild Wild West is just too much. The plot is still thick and twisty (this being a continuation of the terrible Part II) and often hard to understand. The best scenes are with Christopher Lloyd and his new found belle, Mary Steenburgen. It's just much too wild and strange to be a really good movie. So here we are at the end of the trilogy wishing that there had only been one. Why do they make sequels to perfectly good movies?"
4,Family safe,"Good family safe film. My grandson is 8 years old and this movie is his favorite todate. Love the streaming video, easy, and fast."
4,Classic family movie,Great movie to watch with the family. We have all three of the Back to the Future movies and this one is a good ending to the first two movies.
5,Very Helpful,"This is by far the best book I have ever read about sensory processing disorder. It explained the different classifications, the symptoms and the current research very well. I wanted to get a better education about SPD so that I can find the most appropriate services and clinicians for my son, who is on the autism spectrum. This book really helped me get a clear idea of how to do that. I highly recommend this book for anyone who cares for a child with sensory issues."
5,A must read for parents!,Recommended by most therapists. Sure made sense. Helpful for early primary teachers too. This is the best of the genre.
2,Informative But Not Helpful,This book is great for explaining what SPD is but not for giving practical advice and suggestions for dealing with behaviors associated with it. Not a very helpful or useful book in my opinion.
5,Excellent book for a person struggling with gay stereotypes.,"This is a very good book that answers many questions that people have about the gay lifestyle. It is worth spending the time reading or giving to someone that is having problems dealing with the fact that you are gay. It answers many of the misconceptions of religion, cross-dressers, gay relationships, and AIDS. It is a good resource for a gay person who has friends that are having problems dealing with people accepting them"
4,no other choice,"i love my trax360, but in the place we live there is a lot of wind most of the time so i wanted something to help my kids to feel comfortable during the ride and also for some rainy days, the plastic is well made but it seems to tight to fit well but there is no other choice, so some how it does the job"
5,The title says it all,"I actually got this book a few years ago. I had ordered another book about how to attract women that turned out to be a total joke. On the contrary, this book is great. It's easy to read and the insight is amusing and applicable. Ironically, I met a great girl not long after reading this and have been with her for almost 2 1/2 years now. In fact, as I write this review I am sitting on the couch in her bayside condo looking at mission bay and downtown San Diego. No joke."
1,Even more horrors...,"I originally became a Sakura fan when I started watching the series on WB... HOWEVER... soon after, I finally discovered the magic and wonders of the subtitled version (since I speak Japanese). Cardcaptor SAKURA (not CARDCAPTORS) is a WONDERFUL fantastic series which deserves the highest praise!Cardcaptors is not. Relationships, voices, and attitudes have been completely changed. If you like Sakura AVALON, then you may very well love this movie. If you love Sakura Kinomoto, and all the other wonderful JAPANESE characters, you'll hate this movie. Sakura and her responses and battles are completely changed, as is everything else.So... don't waste your money. Buy the subtitled version and get a movie thats well worth watching over and over again. Don't get a version which has been mangled to create even more problems in censorship then there already are."
5,Brunton Satalign Dish Compass,muy satisfecho con este producto aparte muy economico y muy bueno muy recomendable muy bueno es el mejor presio que encontre en linea
3,God-and these people-help us!,"True story of the Civil Air Patrol, a para military organization established by the USAF to aid in searching for downed aircraft, and other humanitarian efforts. Having flown with the C.A.P., I was impressed with the dedication of these volunteers who would drop everything on a moment's notice (including anniversaries) to fly search missions. Many harrowing missions have been flown by the brave flight crews of the C.A.P., and a few are captured in this fine addition. It's a ""looker""!"
2,Forget it,"This product was ordered in August it is almost November, delivery is no where in sight. This might be a great lens but Amazon cannot deliver, Tamron cannot deliver. I have been receiving excuse since August, I called Tamron and they do not have a CLUE! Bottom line is Sigma makes the same lens, buy theirs dont patronize these other yahoo's."
2,Not the greatest...,"For a high school science project...yeah, I guess they would be fine. For testing food products and soil pH, they aren't worth the little plastic tubes they came in."
3,Historical Fort Worth Romance Novel - 2nd book in the Bad Luck Wedding Series,"The Bad Luck Wedding Cake by Geralyn Dawson is a historical Texas romance novel. Claire Donovan moved to Fort Worth after leaving her finacee at the alter. She opens a bakery with a special ingredient called Magic. Tye McBride is caring for his twin brother's children and is living above the bakery. He meets Claire and feels the magic in her baking is aphrodisiac. He tries to stay away from Claire and her baking but fate throws them together. This book has many twist and turns and OK read. Check out the whole series; The Bad luck Wedding Dress (1), The Bad Luck Wedding Cake (2), Summer all night (3), Sizzle all day (4) and The bad luck Wedding Night (5)."
4,Love this series!,"Geralyn Dawson writes lively, fun stories that keep me reading. Try it, you'll like it and come back for more!"
3,Liked this produce.,"Emily March is a new author to me and I enjoyed her work so much, that I will be sure to look for more of her work."
1,I could have bought something else!!,"Otis Rush is one of my favorite singers. That said, this dvd is not very good. Rush's guitar playing gets boring after awhile. Clapton comes out and his guitar tone sounds aweful. Luther Allison does put some life into the set but he plays sparingly. The best licks were played by Rush's rhythm guitarist. He only plays a few leads but he has great tone and really good licks. I wish I would have bought something else........."
2,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed with this book. I was looking for a book that would help me structure my presentation and give me a pool of metaphors and analogies that I could use to help clients understanding. Whilst the end of the book contains maybe 25 metaphor presentations on various topics (diversification, why use an adviser, bear markets etc.) the rest of the book is pretty much filler.Quotes take up half of nearly every page.There are chapters that discuss presenting to the 65+ market and to women that contain very little useful information.There's a frustrating section discussing the ""science"" behind storyselling.[This book isn't worth $5, let alone the $30 it retails for.]"
1,False Advertising,The description said I would receive 6 mascaras. I only received one. I was very upset. I would not recommend purchasing from this vendor. Thanks.
4,good,"At first this was either on or off and not adjustable speed. We removed the rubber ring so it would screw on better and now it is adjustable. Of course, it is no longer waterproof, but that is not a concern for us. It is very smooth and easy to clean. We like that it will fit between us."
2,Really Hard Plastic,"Was made from what I would consider cheap plastic, think plastic easter eggs. Mine had a very noticeable seam which made insertion uncomfortable. The vibrator was ok, but single Speed. I would not recommend this product."
5,it works which is good for me,the product was in original packaging so i know its never been used which is what i look for in buying things online. i am very pleased with the delivery and the product itself there was no deception in the product information.
3,ALMOST as a battery should be,"generally, the battery is fine. just two simple problems:1. there's no way to know if it's finished charging. the small light that should act as an indicator is always lit yellow.2. the battery life is not as long as i expected it to be.otherwise, it's fine. the charger is small so it's fine to take on trips."
1,Did Not Work for My Camera,This battery worked for a little while but then would get a battery error every time I turned it on. My camera was the W series.
1,"Did not work, disappointed on Disney vacation.","I had bought this battery as a backup on and charged it up in the Sony charger (or so I thought). On our trip to Disney and it did not work when our other battery died and popped this in for backup and missed several good pictures/memories that we can't get back:( I would like to exchange as I would hope it is a faulty battery, but don't know how."
5,Just fine but expensive since it is a Sony exclusive,"I bought a Sony DSC-H9 which comes with one battery. When I shoot a full event there is very little chance that the battery will last for a full 2GB, especially if I am shooting video or using steady shot full time. A second battery is a must and there are currently no non-OEM batteries for this model. While you can buy safely buy Sandisk or Lexar pro-duo memory sticks for much less than Sony branded ones, you must buy this battery for Sony cameras."
2,Not as expected,"This battery seems Sony company battery , but it works poor . It does not last expected time on full charge. I have my own Sony's battery same model and this is using for back up purpose . comparing both ,my oroginal sony battery lasts 5hrs continuely using . But this is even though cheper and good price , but it lasts in a few minutes not even 1 hr . I am quite disappointed with this battery . It delivers on time . But i doubt whether is company battery or fake one . thank you"
2,Unpredictable and Unreliable after Awhile,"I've had five of these batteries for my digital camera. It's been hit and miss every time. Some batteries have lasted only a couple months before no longer holding a charge and others for an entire year. The worst part is that when they go bad, it happens very quickly and unfortunately for me, while on vacation so it was difficult to find a replacement at the time I needed it the most.I'm on my fifth battery and it doesn't work so I've ordered a new charger to try to troubleshoot the problem further. Seems far easier to just deal with AA or AAA batteries than the fickle lithium-ion technology."
2,short battery life,I bought this new camera battery to back up the original battery. During a recent wedding the fully charged new battery died after about 40 shots. I am very disappointed.
3,SONY BATTERY,SO FAR THE BATTERY IS WORKING VERY GOOD. AGAIN WE HAVEN'T HAD THIS PRODUCT VERY LONG SO IT IS REALLY HARD TO GIVE AN ACCURATE REVIES. BUT SO FAR IT IS WORKING AS EXPECTED.
5,Great battery for a great camera,I always buy spare batteries. This was a great deal offered through Amazon. Exactly like the one that came with my camera.
5,No problems till now!,Bought this product on amazon and it way cheaper than any other B&M places and don't have any problems till now ofcourse have used it only for less than a month!
1,did not work,"This battery as pictured is identical to the one in my camera. However, it did not work. The camera indicated it was not compatible. We returned it and received a refund thankfully."
4,Very functional,"Purchased to maintain an open USB port on a laptop that has two + 1 ESATA. At first I was concerned that it came with a USB based dongle, but I was able to pair it using the laptops Bluetooth. I later learned this is actually a benefit, as my Bluetooth is tied to my wi-fi, so the dongle allows me to work in a disconnected state. The best thing about this mouse is that you can toggle between between mouse and presentation mode with the touch of a button. This feature is a joy when watching a movie or listening to music from a distance, as I can forward\reverse adjust volume and pause using one device.So far it's been a joy to use. I nixed a star because the Microsoft magnification (Logitech lacks this) causes my screen to blink. This may be a Vista ""feature"", but it should have been compatible from the start.Highly recommended."
2,One fatal flaw,"As a mouse, this guy works pretty well. It's nice to people able to connect via Bluetooth and not keep a dongle hanging around. Sometimes the Bluetooth loses connection, especially as the batteries get older. My other wireless mice just quit working altogether once the batteries get too low. I prefer that behavior. The MS Presenter Mouse just seems like it's having trouble communicating.My cats also appreciate the built-in laser pointer.Where this mouse completely fails - and maybe it's not the mouse's fault - is that the presentation buttons don't work when PowerPoint (at least PP2003) is in ""Presenter Mode"". This is a mode where the the laptop screen displays your notes and the projector displays the slides. I could chalk this up to PowerPoint vs. the Mouse, but it's Microsoft making both products. And it doesn't help that I discovered this problem when I was starting to give a very important presentation in front of a large room of people."
4,Wish it would work without the dongle,I thought this might work with the blue tooth built in to my laptop but unfortunately I had to use the dongle. Sync is good and only a couple of rare occasions I've had to resync the device to the bluetooth. Battery use has also been very low. Very good value compared to other models.
3,Solid Bluetooth Mouse,"Mouse works fairly well, but the precision and battery life leave something to be desired. I'm running my screen at HD resolution and the mouse basically moves in 2-3px increments--important if you need absolute pixel precision for a program like photoshop, totally unimportant for everyday use. The two triple A batteries last about a third as long as a single double A battery in my old RF wireless Logitech mouse.I'd say if you don't have built-in bluetooth in your computer, go for an RF (radio frequency) mouse instead. You don't have to wait for RF mice to pair with the computer, the battery lasts longer, and in the case of my old mouse, it was more precise."
2,This Mouse Squeaks!,"I should start out by saying almost everything about this mouse is flawless. No noticeable mouse delay after inactivity like some Bluetooth mice, tracking is great, battery life is amazing. It paired with my computer's built-in Bluetooth receiver with no trouble. The laser pointer and volume controls are great,it comes with a cool plastic carrying case, but there is just one problem that haunts this hardware. The mouse buttons squeak!This may seem like a minor issue (and maybe it is to some people), but it's like a chalkboard screech to me when every click is met by *squeak* *squeak*. I think one other reviewer noted the problem, I've discovered similar complaints via Google and I actually wondered if it was just my mouse but I returned my first mouse and the replacement had the same problem.This would be a five-star mouse if it weren't for the squeak, but the defect makes me feel like I'm being generous by giving two stars."
4,microsoft laser presenter bluetooth mouse,A very good deal. Item arrived at hotel before I did from Brisbane Australia after ordering on our Friday and arriving late on Monday in Chicago. Bluetooth works seemlessly under vista business. button functions seem to go to sleep after extended use without using magnifier button etc. the magnifier option very handy for my screen eyes so poor over short distances and very common problem i guess. laser pointer handy addition great mouse cheap price excellent software very happy.
5,The small wireless Microsoft mouse,We saw this little compact mouse unit at a friends house and really were impressed with it. We are very pleased with the convenience of the mouse as well as the job it does. I would reccommend it to anyone.
3,Nice but eats batteries,"I was given this mouse (Presenter 8000) as a gift. At first I loved it, but it has a couple of significant flaws. The worst one is that it eats batteries. It takes 2 AAA batteries; I've had the mouse about 2 months and the second set of batteries just failed - a month per set is unacceptable. It has auto-sleep so there's no excuse for this. Further, it doesn't like rechargeables, so that's not an option.The other flaw is that it loses its marbles every so often. The pointer lags noticeably so it's impossible to position accurately with any speed. This happens to me a couple of times a day, and I have to turn the mouse off & on to reset it. Really annoying.Other than that it's a nice mouse!"
1,Eats batteries,I just have to say that this mouse EATS batteries - takes 2 AAA and they last maybe 2 weeks. I'm returning to a simple wireless mouse where the 1 AA battery never dies.
4,Solid All Rounded Mouse,PROSAll buttons are customizable and can be tagged to macros.You can use the mouse without the dongle that MS gives if your PC has bluetooth built in.Mouse is comfortable to hold. Presenter functions are easy to use.Installation is simple.Battery life is solid. Mouse comes with on/off buttonCONSLeft and right button clicking feels a little rigidWeird placement of the back and forward buttons (good for small hands only)
3,"""clear"" curtain","This product appears to be of excellent quality, but it is not clear as advertised. You cannot see through this product, which is what I wanted."
4,"Pretty Good, still got a little mold","The packaging on this liner claimed to be mold resistant and it has been more so than any of the other so called ""resistant"" curtains we've had before. However the liner still has some mold growth but after over a year or so it still has not become so bad that the liner needs to be replaced.I will say that this is without regular cleaning but with some shower cleaning, YMMV depending on your own shower cleaning habits."
1,Very heavy liner!,"This liner is very heavy. I couldn't use it - it pulled down my shower rod. If you like super heavy, it's for you!"
2,Does not last as long.,"I purchased three RayoVac akaline batteries for smoke alarms and our wall clock. They claim to ""Last as long as Energizer."" Unfortunately they did not last as long. I have had regular heavy duty batteries last longer. The smoke alarm was 6 months, and the clock was 3 months. Energizer leaves them in the dust. I will give them credit in that RayoVac did replace the batteries, but I will not buy them again."
3,informative read,"Even though the book was written several years ago, it still has a lot of information that is relevant to today. A great read!"
1,This mascara ruined my lashes.,"I used this mascara for one week. I couldn't take if off with my normal face cleansing method. One week later I used baby oil to finally remove it all. Not only did all the clumps come out, but so did many of the lashes bound to the clumps. The lashes that remain are shorter."
3,I love Marilyn but not the book,I liked the book because it dose give a lot of information about her and her life. But the book also talks about all these other people and it critisises her and her life and a author should not do that about the subject he is writing about. So I think this book is good to get for people who are more interested in her death more then the girl herself. If you truely love Marilyn she would not want you to buy this junk. It dose have a lot of cool pictures but thats all I would buy it for.
5,Marilyn Monroe the Biography,"riveting, well researched and well written. One of those books you cannot put down and look forward to reading every day."
1,To be avoided...,"I love MM -isn't she what any woman dream to be and any man dream to be with ?- and recommend other books for fans who really want to get acquainted with her and discover touching details about her life (Wolfe's, Summer's, among others). A lot of fantasy exposed in this book (Norman Mailer was more successful in his and the pictures are more entertaining!) and not many interesting facts. If there is a truth about Marilyn, it is not in there ..."
4,Marilyn Monroe The Biography,"I always like to look at the one and two star reviews for books. Sometimes I think they must be written by competing authors. Anyways, this book isn't a challenge to read. In fact, it's a compelling, well-thought out, definative bio. I think that Spoto gives a lot more realistic arguements for Marilyn's demise that than the conspiritist group. I've read the the conspritist books and by themselves, living on an island without the internet, they're more than a little convincing. However, after having read Spoto's one can pretty well get the idea that an accident happened. It didn't have to - but it did. More than likely this was the answer. ( see Occam's razor)"
3,Good but not much better than others,"Compared to the Mach 3 Power (M3Power) razor, I didn't think there was a significant difference in actual shaving performance. I think the 5 blades is more of a gimmick, though I like the overall design, handle, and the fact that it vibrates. I am only giving it three stars because of the high replacement blade costs and the somewhat gimmicky design of 5 blades, but it's not a bad razor. I think the shaving performance is good but not great."
3,"Incrementally improved, but not enough for the typical M3 Power user","I've used this for about a week, compared it to the M3 Power and an earlier Gillette blade. I have a dark, fast growing, above average thickness bristles with average density.Slightly closer shave than the M3 Power, of little difference if you have a lighter hair or beard. I found I could shave a little faster with this blade.Slightly less comfortable for me: the blades pull my hair just a little, the vibration is a little too strong (I'm somewhat sensitive to vibration in my right hand) and I found the handle more likely to get slippery in the shower vs. the M3 Power.I found the trim blade to be a good addition for under the nose and sideburns."
2,Stay true with two!,"If I ran Schick I'd immediately pull the Quattro from the market, declaring it a flawed product. I would then focus on a new ad campaign touting the benefits of the good ol' fashioned two blade models."
2,Pretty Bad shave,HiAll i can say is whoever said a blade shaves closer than an electric never tried the Fusion......this is the worst shave ever. even worse than cheap disposibles. Save your money.
2,Mach 3 is a better razor,"The Fusion razor looks snazzy, but in NO WAY does it give a better shave than the Mach 3. The blades are dull and worn out after one use, whereas you can get 2-3 shaves with the Mach 3 before you need to change the blade. At $3 per blade that is not worth it.I am getting rid of the Fusion and sticking with the Mach 3, a better and more reasonable product....until GE comes out with another over priced product that doesn't work as well as the original."
2,Gillette has gone downhill,"This product ruins the classic Gillette name. Who really needs five blades on a razor? I have coarse facial hair and the last thing I want is five blades scrapping my face at the same time. Even when I shave very careful and go with the grain, I get very painful ingrown hairs and razor bumps. I won't even start on the price Gillette charges for this razor and its cartridges...I have tossed this razor and now use a ""old school"" safety razor, the razor that made Gillette a household name. I get a much closer and more comfortable shave. Gillette, now owned by Procter and Gamble, definitely isn't what it used to be. I gave this product two stars instead of one simply because those with finer facial hair may have better luck with this product than I had."
1,Sensor Excel is 10 times better and much cheaper to boot!,"It never ceases to amaze me how often Gillette comes out with new gimmicks to take more money from it's loyal clientele.The Fusion is a classic example, from overpriced shaving gel to a much overpriced razor which quite honestly gives you the same shave as a Sensor Excel.Don't buy into the hype, the Fusion is an expensive joke of a product."
2,Blood too often,"I was a long time user of Trac3, and also used Quattro and was impressed, but the Fusion cut me almost every time I used it. I liked the single blade for those hard to get at spots, but that feature could not overcome the difficulty of keeping my face free of little cuts."
4,Lots of outlets,"Although only time will tell how it holds up, it is designed very well. With the pivoting plugs, it allows plugs that would be useless on other designs accessible & usable. With many electronics having large housings these days, this feature seems essential. Happy so far."
5,Belkin Pivot is best in class,"If you want to best designed surge protector made today, this is the one. Using these to charge 10 iPads at once. Flexible plug position and efficient use of space make this the only on ei oulw recommend for this purpose."
4,convenience,"The Belkin Pivot Plug Surge Protector was exactly what we were looking for. Often times., you will have a plug that wont fit on a normal ""line"" surge protector., With the Belkin Pivot heads, it helps to allow different types of heads to fit in."
4,Great Surge Protector,I have this surge protector in my man cave and all my electronics are running through it. Does the job and does it well. Pivot feature is awesome.
5,Pivot Soskets Makes A Winner !!,"The Pivot Sockets Really makes it a Winner! Small, fits anywhere, can plug those big ugly black boxe's into it with no sweat. Also that nice long cord comes in handy. I now have 4, Great !!! E"
3,doesn't have a switch,"(1) the securing screw is made for the older style outlets and won't work for newer outlets. As I paid only $13 for this device, I didn't bother to return it. I simply removed the screw and sawed off the plastic bit, and it can be reasonably stably plugged into the wall mount without the screw.(2) this surge protector doesn't have a switch! My initial intention was to connect all of my TV-related devices to this surge protector so that I can switch them off completely in one go without unplugging every individual device (standby mode still drains juice and my cable set-top box doesn't have a standby mode).(3) $13 for a brand-name surge protector is not a bad deal."
1,Power Hog,"Like some of the other reviewers, we had trouble with power outages using this strip. Even without anything plugged into it, it kept throwing breakers. A look at the specifications and the mystery is solved: the strip by itself draws a massive 1800 watts! That's more than an electric hair dryer (1300W). We ended up not even being able to use it and had to buy another strip."
5,very good product,"I bought this for my computer room. It actually works great, I connected all my devises to this surge, which is great because saved me a lot of space. It's pivot plugs don't let any of your devices out.Very good product!"
5,Great Strip,"It is everthing I thought it would be and more. Well made, you can twist the outlets so your plugs will fit properly. I like the built in wire manager, it does help to keep your wires from going everywhere. Belkin makes good stuff."
2,12 outlet surge protector with 4 that don't take either 3 or 2 prong plugs,"Purchased 2 new surge protectors the outside outlets that swivel work find but allthe center plugs that are stationary will not accept either 2 or 3 prong plugs hopefully the surge protector works better than the outlet, unless the purpose of the non operational outlets is to keep you from plugging in any electronics so they can't blow"
1,Plastic Junk,It took me about 20 minutes to get my equipment plugged in because of the plastic safety tabs.Now I am afraid to unplug anything and find that plug unusable.I wouldn't pay $2 for another one.
4,"Handles current nicely, middle plugs kind of tought to plug items into","1000 Watt PSU, 3 23"" 1080p monitors, and more likely some other things and has not failed me yet. The one problem I have noticed on it is the center stationary plug-ins on it are very tough to plug items into it for some odd reason (dunno if it the holes are too close together or far apart or something else). The pivot plugs are very nice and can easily plug items into it.It's kind of a large surge protector. For the price, I believe it was worth every penny thus far."
3,Does the job,"I bought this for my nightstand. It seems as if I was alwys unplugging something to plug something else in. This plugs directly into the outlet so you dont have some clumsy thing laying on the floor, which I like. Fits snug, doesnt fall out. Bought as a lightening deal for $10 and very happy with itETA> A year later and I felt the need to add that this easily comes loose from the wall socket. At least once a day, I have to push it back into the socket. I will deduct two stars from this due to that as it is a big pain in the butt."
2,Will not work with ATT Uverse,"Great surge protector for standard plugs, and phone line BUT will not allow data signal from ATT uverse to pass through protector. Therefore, you don't get channel guide information, menu's, etc..."
2,Couple of the outlets don't work,Couple of the outlets don't work with grounded plugs. The problem is in the center non-rotating outlets. the second from the bottom felt like something broke when I attempted to insert a grounded plug and it will not fully seat in the outlet. That outlet and the one directly above it will not power a grounded plug. A plug with only two prongs works okay. I did not return it though because of the hassle and the fact I do not need all of the outlets. I use all of the rotating outlets and they are working fine. I like the rotating feature. Keeps everything in my setup looking less cluttered since the wires lay flat with the surge protector.
5,Don't waste your money on a smaller protector.,This is a great functional product. Spend a few extra dollars and purchase this larger surge protector. You will be certianly glad you did.
5,Best Surge Protector I Have Owned,"What makes this sure protector unique is the receptacles pivot giving you room for those electronic items that have odd shaped power bricks. I was having to use 2 power strips before to accommodate all the power bricks and cables. The Belkin even has a lever that folds down to keep all of your cables nice and neat. My T.V. is run through the surge protector as well as my cable modem, router, lcd tv, roku box, blu-ray player, surround system. I have tried a lot of different surge protectors and this is the one i will use from now on."
3,Wish it had a built in Cable Surge,"Using this for my flat screen TV, XBox and Blu-ray, just wish it had a built in cable surge protection."
1,Lasted less than a year!,"Bought it for my computer and after about 8 or 9 months the button switch wouldn't stay on, we had to push it 3 or 4 times before it turned on.finally It caused a blown fuse, we unplugged the computer and tried again and It shorted again.Pros: the mobile socketsCons: Durability, unsafe, Price: for a few bucks more you can get a UPS."
4,Wall plug could be improved.,"Since the product is new, I can't rate the dependability. You assume it's working as advertised unless there is a failure. However, for my situation it would be better if the cord had a flat wall plug. The outlet I use is 14"" above the floor, and right next to my desk chair. A flat plug would allow the cord to hug the wall rather than protruding out 3"" before it can be bent downward. This presents a minor hazard.My previous surge protector had a flat plug, so it didn't occur to me to check that feature. The flat plug allowed me to use a less-easily-reached outlet, which eliminated the minor hazard."
4,Get this book,"This book was fabulous! I liked how Sharon Creech could relate a girls feelings, and make the world cry, laugh, and see through the eyes of this girl. I shared her triumphs! Keep the books coming!"
5,Book Review of Absolutley Normal Chaos,Carl Ray is coming!This book is about Mary Lou Finney a small town girl from Easton with a big family who is asked to write a journal over the summer for English class. She writes about all the things she does in the summer some of which she doesn't want her teacher to read. What will happen to Mary Lou Finney and her family this summer?This book is very well written because you feel the character's emotions as they feel them. It is also well written because there is an element of surprise throughout the whole story.
5,The definitive book on direct marketing,"Great for beginners and experts, this text gives excellent step by step instructions on every pertinent direct marketing concept. This is the only good ""how-to"" book that you will find on such a wide variety of topics.Relevant Topics include: Setting up a marketing database & using statistics to predict response &segment; customers!"
1,junk,"The first one is way better than this one, one jet is plugged and the handle falls apart. I am looking to buy the first one as I did not keep mine."
2,Poor for the environment; expensive replacement pads and cleaning solution,"The product is O.K. for it's purpose. I'm unable to use my own solution for cleaning. I live in a small town and am having difficulty finding the refill pads. It would have been nice to have a washable, reuseable pad, both as a money saving feature and to further protect the environment. Would not purchase had I realized."
1,Not much to tell,"The product didn't work right out of the box. After spending half an hour wondering what I was doing wrong (checking the batteries, adjusting the pad and fluid), I realized I had merely been sold a defective product. I contacted the company, and was told that this ""sometimes just happens"". Not to a company that expects repeat customers, it doesn't."
1,"Garbage!! Bottle Leaks, Cheap Pads!!","I bought this a few years ago and thought it was absolute garbage. The cleaning pads they sell to go with it hardly pick anything up, they dry out within 30 seconds of mopping, not even enough time for me to sweep my small, small kitchen. The bottle of solution also leaked all over the place. Tried to fix it, but realized it was just garbage so It went back to the store. I have had bad luck with Swiffer products, have bought 3 or 4 of them now and I don't understand what the hype is all about. It's JUNK!"
4,Are these negative reviews for real?,"People must have incredibly filthy homes if this system can't keep up. I wash my floors every day, after dinner, before bed. It's my ritual. My husband handles the upper level and I handle the lower level. It takes us each about 20 minutes to cover one level. We have over 2,300 square feet of maple floors. I don't use this on the bathroom tiles as I prefer to clean those floors on my hands and knees with ammonia and water every morning before my shower.People are complaining that the pads are too dirty. Ummm.... your FLOORS are too dirty. Those who prefer to use a mop over this system have no understanding of how absolutely filthy a mop can be.The only reason it doesn't get five stars??? Not a bio-degradable pad. But it's a lot less ""waste"" than a disposable diaper."
1,doesn't work :(,My swiffer jet doesn't work! It doesnt spray the anything out i press the the button and it doesnt work. I'm very upset.
2,Good for pushing dirt around,"I've got a small bit of hardwood space in my apartment, and I figured this would suit my mopping needs. It hasn't.Even after sweeping the area multiple times prior to using the WetJet, I've found that it doesn't really pick any dirt up. What I wind up with is a polished floor with a lot of small piles of dirt everywhere. I'm even using the ""special"" hardwood floor solution- it isn't making a difference. I don't recommend this product for anything other than polishing a floor (and there are probably better solutions for that as well)."
2,Swiffer Wet Jet,I love the manueverability. The cleaning solution dries to a dull finish. Had to go back and reapply a product with wax in it if I wanted a shiny floor.
2,USED to love this item,"I bought the swiffer wet jet when it came out back in 2003 or so. I LOVED it. It really made cleaning hardwoods and tile easily. I noticed however a year or two ago that the cleaning pad has been changed to a thinner, less absorbent pad. The pad just moves around the dirt and cleaning solution and doesnt actually suck up the soil like the old pad did. I didnt realize what a horrible job it was doing until I decided to get out an old mop and just use water and vinegar. WOW were my floors dirty even right after using the swiffer wet jet! I just moved about 2 mos ago and ended up leaving it in the closet...felt bad throwing it away since it did give me a few years of good cleaning. Wouldnt ever use it again unless swiffer changes to a better more absorbent pad."
3,Swiffer Wet Jet Mop,"I've been using the Swiffer Wet Jet Mop for about a year. I use it for basic clean up. Nothing major. I switch out the hardwood floor cleaner with the all purpose cleaner. The only problem with the Wet Jet is that when I mop it sometimes takes forever to dry up. The smell is nice but I have a dog, and I have to hold him until the floors dry. But I do like the mop and I think it's very easy to use."
2,Requires 4 AA batteries.,"Works ok.I was a bit miffed to find out it requires FOUR AA batteries to even use.The cleaning solution sprayer doesn't work without batteries. This seems silly. A simple spray bottle doesn't need batteries, why couldn't there be a similar spray mechanism on the WetJet?Doesn't clean quite as well as I expected. You have to spray a lot of solution to clean even a lightly soiled area."
3,"Ehh, okay","Swifter wet jet is OKAY. Not great but not completely bad. I've found that all this does is push dirt around. So if you play on using this you must get every little spect of dirt and dust up first, which sweeping alone does not cut it. I mainly just use it for spill clean up or spot mopping. The Solution and pads are kind of pricey."
3,I like it,"Ok, I am one lazy clean -up person. I've had my wet jet for 2.5 years, and it has finally conked out. The battery is still going strong, but the sprayer doesn't do the job anymore, just a long stream of solution trickling onto the floor. When the wet jet worked, it worked great on my wood floors. One pad, though, got through one third of each room cleaning-told you I was kinda lazy in cleaning up. I have six birds who poop all over the place, every day , all day, so it's not worth my while to keep up with them every day, all day. When I do get around to cleaning, I spray the solution over the poop, let it soak for less than a minute, and the poop comes right up. I want to buy a new wet jet that works, but the price has gone up significantly from the $12.00 I paid two years ago. Oh, well. I'll just have dirtier floors longer..........."
1,a great disappointment!,"The first time I used it I was surprised at how little cleaning it did. A month later, when I tried it again, even though the batteries were OK, the fluid did not come out when I tried the spray. A real waste of money and time."
5,Hardwood floors will love this,"I have over 2000 sq. feet of Oak flooring in my home and happened across this product. Skeptical, I decided to give it a go. One word, Fantastic!. My floors have not been cleaner since the day they were installed, and along with the antibacterial properties of the cleaning solution and the pleasant citrus smell you have the perfect hard surface cleaner. I cleaned the entire floor with 1/2 bottle and 2 pads, and it was dirty. If you are tired of the old vinegar and water routine on your wood floors, give this product a try. I LOVE IT!"
3,Okay- for small jobs only.,"I purchased this after a friend recommended it. I have hardwoods floors throughout my living room, dining room, hallway, and kitchen. I needed something to clean them effectively as I have a toddler and a dog. At first I liked it until I noticed that it leaves streaks of film on my floor. It looks dusty almost like it wasn't cleaned in areas. I sometimes have to go over an area 2 or 3 times. This product is good for small quick spills, but I would not recommend it for larger areas."
4,Love this thing...but,"I especially wanted to wait until after a big gathering at my home to review this mop and since Independence Day just passed here it goes.... This is a great everyday mop but don't throw out your wonder mop just yet. While it is great for my home of three adults, if you have a lot of spills or heavy traffic you will want to keep a more absorbent, heavy duty mop around. For my home we can just use an absorbent microfiber towel or something similar on most days and one pad will do the trick for my kitchen. But I found myself yesterday having to bust out my old mop to clean up some no so tiny spills and this morning having to use three pads to clean my kitchen alone. Overall I love this mop, it's easy to use and set up."
1,Do Not Buy - This is a waste of money,I would rather leave my floor dirty than push all the dirt to one location and watch it pile up. Do not buy this product. I got on my hands and knees when I was done to clean properly. No floor cleaner I have tried is of any value. Retailers that carry this product do not care about selling quality product.
4,convenient.,"Living in a small apartment, it is much easier to keep a Swiffer and a few refill pads around than various mops, buckets, solutions, etc. This product works well although it can be pricey to keep buying solution and refill pads as well as batteries."
4,Very Handy,"The swiffer wet jet is very handy to have around and it even promotes extra cleaning. You don't have to get out a bucket and all that, just the easily storeable wet jet and start cleaning."
1,STREAKS!!!,"No matter what I do, can't get rid of the streaks. Tried using more...less, it leaves a nasty film. My floors aren't very dirty to begin with, but then I drag out my old mop with just water to get the dried, streaky solution off the floor. The pads are expensive to use. Mine only lasts maybe 1 large room. Not at all economic. Becomes very expensive with the solution, pads and all. Not great at cleaning either."
1,Problems with sprayer pump made the Wet Jet Useless,"We have purchased two Swiffer WetJets and are disappointed in their quality. The same problem was encountered with both WetJets - that being the sprayer pump ceased to function which made the wet mop virtually useless.When the product worked it was very good, however having the pump mechanism fail after only a short time made the Swiffer WetJet a useless product."
1,I am going to throw it out and buy a mop!,"I've had my Swiffer Wet Jet for over a year, and I have never been impressed with it. I have to use so much cleaning solution, and you have to keep buying the cleaning pads (which don't last long, and don't really pick up anything!) All the Wet Jet does is just push around the dust and hair on my floor. If there is any actual spot that is hard to get off, you are supposed to be able to use this rough part of the Swiffer to scrape it off. However, it is just like the rough part of velcro and doesn't work very well. I end up having to grunt and break out a sweat pushing the Wet Jet back and forth over the spot. Don't buy this, it is too expensive and doesn't work well enough!"
4,Not Bad...,A little thinnner walled than it appears. Functions great... but in reality I don't see fitting more than 8 full size rifles in this thing. Great price for what you get... and it'll definately deter someone from casually walking out of your house with it. I piled weights under the the base boards to add some weight. I feel much safer with my safe!
2,Not so perfect,This book only offers very general information about each fish a very big problem with these fish is agression and how to make your fish compatible with each other.I just expected more.
3,Works fine but literature is sparse,"The unit seems to work fine, however, I have never used one before and was depending on the literature to give me a basic understanding of how and when to use the various settings. It had none of that. It did cover the basic button functions in about 47 languages... glad for that. It now sits on my shelf unused because I don't know how to set it for the songs I play. Unfortunately, the tablature I use to play guitar does not give that information either. Seller was great, no problems there."
1,Socs,"I have several pair of the Wright socks-XLT (double layer, thick). I purchased them several years ago. I used them to do a 2-day walk in 2005. I didn't have any problems with buring feet or blisters. Since that 2-day walk, I've participated in several walks using the same sock and didn't have any problems with my feet.I purchased this Wrightsock double layer running sock and used them to train for a 5K walk. I had trouble with my feet burning just during the training. I switched back to my old socks and did not have any problems. I used the old socks for everything (walking, working out, spinning, cycling) - lucky I have 6 pair I previously purchased. Unfortunately, I don't plan to purchase any more socks from Wrightsocks unless I find out they are making the thick double layer socks again."
4,Brings back good ol' memories of Texas and Oklahoma!,"As an old Okie who grew up in the '50s listening to the Texas/Oklahoma variety of western swing music, Hank Thompson always stood out as the best ever. His band was always top notch, tight and tasteful, with a sound that made people want to dance. Hank's singing, with that warm sincere voice, always pleased the ear. On this new CD he sounds exactly the same, if not better, and the band is great. His unique songs like ""Green Light"" and ""I'll Still be Here Tomorrow"" show his mix of humor and simple sincerity, with musical taste."
5,cool red hampers,"How much happiness can three hampers bring me? A lot! I bought three of these. I automatically sort my laundry by color, so I don't have to sort afterwards. So i just bring em to the machine. This has a pocket, and a compartment too! I think the purpose of which is to segregate clothes within the hamper (colors from whites as an example). So yes so far so good!"
5,The Magic Bullet?,"Could this discovery be the magic bullet cancer research has been searchinf for? Quite possibly. All I have to say is that anyone who has had cancer has cancer, or has it and has been told not to expect much from conventional therapy simply must read this book and they check out the PolyMVA website. The long review up front at Amazon says it all but how the Doc arrived at this discovery is very interesting and not too far out scientifically to be understood by the mainstream."
3,Ok not quite what it was hyped up to be,This book has some excellent problems to get students thinking. I was expecting a little more out of it. Some of te problems were great real world situations others seemed forced into a real world situation.
1,bad book,"this might be the worst book ive ever read, actually it definately is. it has no value whatsoever, dont read this to your kids, class, friends, any one, it should never be read. it is (...), doesnt deserve the one star."
4,not for every johnny cash fan,"This cd is definitely not for every Johnny Cash fan, especially fans not familiar with the bands and artists on this cd.Some songs are in the same vein as the familiar versions, but most are not.I look at it more as a compilation of some bands that I enjoy than as a tribute album."
4,boyish sarcastic work,"A French spy did everything in Cairo-55 to keep French Empire intact as a movie was produced in 2006 aka 007 very copy-cat, embedding today anti-terror (and many other)issues explicitly and politically-incorrect, sarcastically-anti-British.Easy watching."
3,Cool,It was not like our evrey day whitches you end up not knowing what they are. This is a cool movie for these girls that from almost the begining you know something is strange about them because they are always trying to make it seem like other people are the cause of evreything. But this is a really good movie.
3,amazon customer service in india and korea,I did not know amazon was now farming their orders out to individuals and that customer service reps did not speak english. Finally got my order 6 weeks later.
4,Entertainingly thought-provoking,"Like a series of footnotes to an otherwise non-existent text, SA is a collection of so many observations -- few of them original, many of them interesting, all of them all the more interesting for their juxtaposing. SA is a bit of philosophy, a bit of history, a bit of sociology, and some other bits tossed in a bowl and stirred together. The resulting brew had just enough caffeine to keep me awake and alert from start to finish, and just enough flavor to please the palate. Having finished, I now have a keener sense of why status anxiety is, ever was, and will likely ever be a significant force in human affairs. Overall, a pleasurable and thought-provoking read."
1,not worthy to read the book..,"one of the worst book and dull book to read about ""needs"" and ""wants""..author offers irrelevant internal needs that are driving to be part of the higher class of the group...but ignoring the fact these could be externally driven as many matters of facts...very hollow book with even daring acts of providing ""solutions"" to cure this problem of blindly chasing higher status..one important aspect is Films for Actions offers the same title by same author documentary film which offers a better overview of the sickness of the society in which the book did not clearly stated...[...]"
4,Almost perfect!,I rarely give anything the highest rating. I'm happy with the price and the color. I don't use black mascara due to my very dark eyes.
2,Inadequate sound,"Some of this set is OK. The piano concertos come off pretty well overall. But the recorded sound, evewn though all digital, is often poor."
2,STARRING JENNIFER SAUNDERS?,Another mislabled product. The description gave the impression that this was a Saunders movie. Got it. Tossed it.
4,Only for expecting parents or parents of a newborn!,"I wish this had existed when my baby was on her way because she was a few months old by the time this DVD came out. Great help for parents wanting to know how to calm their baby, change their baby, and other basic care. Not so great for parents of slightly older babies who have already been doing these things for quite a while. Good baby shower gift for someone."
4,Want to be creative with beads ?,"If you need some advices to learn how to let flow your creative ""juice"", Here is the book !Good and precise ""step by step"" lessons on some useful stitches, 10 projects (from very simple to quite advanced !) and above all a wonderful gallery full of incredible contemporary beaded works.Once you've made the preconised exercices, you are ready to go and begin your own travel in the beading world !"
4,"Eclectic, yes...BUT","Once again, Mr. Starkey has proven that he can take from 4 to 7 musicians from any genre and turn them into a tight-as-a-tick band. God bless you, Ringo. But still: WHEN are you going the release the absolute GREATEST ""Ringo's All Starr Band"" configuration, that of Peter Frampton, Gary Brooker, Jack Bruce, and Simon Kirke on DVD? PLEASE?"
5,RIP Root Boy,"This is a great CD. I could give a crap about the sound from the vinyl or the CD. If you like music of a different kind. Buy this CD. BTW, Root Boy passed away in 1993. I found that out checking out RBS sites. Anyway. I used to have the vinyl when it came out, but I was jazzed to find it finally on CD. Have fun ya'll"
5,We are level,"My husband just had to have this. Oh Well, I thought. It has proved to be quite useful in leveling our trailer."
3,a good buy,This was a good buy. It has a good coursebook and dictionary. The only drawback is that it is pretty boring. The course is in no way exciting or even that interesting. It just gives a straightforward course of the Japanese language.
1,Disappointed,Bought these for my son's science fair project and NONE OF THEM HATCHED! Very disappointed. Hopefully we can find a different brand that will work.
5,"Everything's great, as long as you follow the instructions","The product arrived in excellent condition. Contrary to what the previous reviews say, if you follow the instructions and put the eggs in aerated (water pump) salted (with aquarium water) tap water, then in 24h you 'll have a LOT of baby shrimps. Their size is really small, so it is good to use them as food for other fish/lizards. They don't stay alive for more than 2 days unless you want them to. I guess you need to feed them and take care of them."
1,they didnt hatch,we tryed more than once and followed instructions to a t but they never hatched. luckly we bought another brand of shrimp along with this and were very happy with the results
1,What a flop!,Only a few scenes were slightly amusing at best. Cannot recommend this one as a comedy.
3,Glen Campbell Christmas Film,I hope that this film will be released on DVD because it is a classic. It features interesting footage from Glen's Christmas shows on the Goodtime Hour. I remember watching some of the features on TV in the 1970's. Every Glen Campbell fan should own a copy of this film.
5,Important Christmas album remastered!,"This has been my favorite Christmas (and Easter) CDs for some time. When I heard that Peterson was releasing a remastered version, I couldn't figure out how he could improve it. Now that I've heard this and the original side-by-side, the remastered version is easily better. You can hear it right off the bat with the percussion enhancement in the first song.People always want to break out different songs on an album as their favorites, but I don't think that works here. This ""song cycle"" works best as just that: all the songs played in order to tell one cohesive story. If I had to pick one, it would be the last song for its stunningly creative recall of the different pieces, folding them into each other until we're back to the opening song's chorus.Fantastic work from a fantastic artist. A must have for any Christian who takes the story seriously."
1,Poor mp3 quality,The poor mp3 quality Amazon has up for this album make it basically unlistenable.Props to Amazon though--they immediately refunded my purchase.
5,"Traditional gospel lyrics with an ""out of this world"" voice","He remains true to his gospel background. There is no compromise in any of his lyrics. The lyrics are amazing, all of which you can play to a diverse crowd. I have yet to see a person not appreciate his music. It is just to bad he is not better labeled for more advertisement."
5,Incredible voice! God-inspired musice! You will LOVE it!,This is truly a great CD. Jonathan (and his wife) have written most of the songs. Jonathan is the former lead singer of the Imperials and the Gaither Vocal Band. Great music for all listeners - you will be blessed.
3,Tails of Devotion,A nice book. I was a little disappointed because I thought there would be more narrative/stories about people and their pets. But still a very heartwarming book.
5,A tale of love,This book has truly captured the unique relationship between pets and their humans. The myriad animals that are represented show that you don't need fur to be loved! I have one on my coffee table and have given 2 as gifts to animal lovers. Ordering more to have on hand -- everyone can appreciate these stories! That the proceeds are going to four not for profits in support of animals is another winner!
1,A great book ruined !,"The book was made into a GREAT movie in 1952. For some odd reason, they tried to re-do it in 1998 and the result is AWFUL.The casting is all wrong, the script is totally re-done until it does not even resemble the original. The ending just fizzles out and has no point. Imagine going to see West Side Story, but there is no music, and everyone lives at the end. You would wonder what idiot was trying to pass off that farce as being the genuine West Side Story.It is exactly the same situation here, if you buy this version you will NOT be seeing the REAL story, and you won't even be seeing very good acting. It is an absolute waste of time, period !!!"
4,good purchase,A book that is good to for giving massages in the same movement that you are reading. It's a practical book~
3,More like 3 1/2 stars,"I use this book a lot, but basically to make the same recipes over again. I have gotten many ideas from this and used ingredients I have not utilized before. I rarely make the recipes as stated as I usually need a lot more flavor then called for. It is a good book to get ideas fom, but it's not too practicle for everyday use as I find most vegetarian cookbooks aren't."
2,Mediocre,"The layout of the text is monotonousThe content is below average as comparedto many other physical exam texts, importantexam techniques like ober's test, acetabularstress test, patrick's test etc are notdealt with adequatelyPoor buy"
5,"One of the ""Classics"" for athletic trainers","This book by Hoppenfeld is a truly a standard for the athletic training profession. The text is easy to follow and the figures and diagrams are very clear. The book is laid out well and lends itself to study easily. Every athletic training student should have a copy--to study for the NATABOC exam and to use as a daily reference in the ""real world"" following certification."
1,Shame on HP,"I have used HP brochure/flyer paper for about ten years and I just ran out. I bought what is supposed to be the same product, same number , weight, brightness etc and IT IS HALF AS GLOSSY AS BEFORE and not at all the quality of the previous great product. I will have to see if any other company has brochure paper since I will not buy HP again!"
3,A colorful book with one or two errors,"I got this book in order to understand the game I brought. It has all the information I need. Character profiles, special and finishing moves, combos, links, and opponent strategies. It is in color with clear pictures, but some are too small to make out. There are main problems with this book. One, it doesn't have a Sub-Zero section, just the classic version. Second, it doesn't cover the Sega Saturn version of the game, which I have. It might be similar to the Sony Playstation, but the SS game has some things PS don't have, and vice versa. This is good book to use, unless you are a Sub-Zero fan."
2,Nice little fridge but is not 12V,"This is a cute little fridge, however by looking at the advertisement and the reviews I was under the impression this was a 12V and AC capable. This is not the case, it is AC only. Had to return the item and Amazon was very accommodating."
1,Careful with that handle,"The handle broke off on day two - bad design... It emits considerable noise. But, it chills - for now... Update: just 4 months into the shopping experience - it no longer cools... Avoid this product..."
1,Horrible product,"I received this item as a Christmas gift last year (2011). Was very excited because I'd been wanting a small fridge to keep in my bedroom. I was suprised to see that it was a lot smaller than I expected, but I was ok with that. What is NOT ok is how the motor in this piece'o'crap stopped working after 6 months. Thats when I found that it only has a 90 day warranty. So the manufacturers know that it's a piece of junk that won't last longer thatn a few months. Nice! But even without the motor failing this product never kept anything really cold anyway. Barely cool is how I would describe the temperature in this thing. So after a few days with it I knew I'd have trash it and buy something else (which is bad to say since it was a gift). Overall this product is a waste of money!"
2,"Cute, loud & luke warm","I am looking for a small refrigerator for office and hope to find one that I can carry in and out of the office. After reviewing all the feedback, I purchased this little thing. I was not expecting this fridge to do much, just being able to keep the coffee creamer and maybe a couple cans of soda cool will do.My office temp. is kept at 70 degree F year round. The document said the fridge should get to 32 degrees lower. Unfortunately it only gets a little bit cold and it is very loud.Very cute, but it does not meet the stated performance."
3,Keeps drink cold but at what cost,"This fridge does a good job of keeping small water bottles, juiceboxes and fruit cups cold. Exactly what my 12 year old daughter wanted to keep in her room. Unfortunately it sounds like a jet plane is taking off when it's running...And it's constantly running (humming). The ""hum' reminds me of the much larger old refrigerators you had to defrost! She said it kept her up at night and decided not to keep it in her room after all. My 9 year old son has claimed it for his own and has no problem sleeping with it in his room so we kept it."
1,Unhappy,"Liked the size however, the description says the frig will cool to 32 degrees. It doesn't even come close to that. It averages around 40 degrees. It makes a difference when you are using this item to store your medical Insulin."
4,It is really cold,I bought this to keep in it some milk when in the office. I just like my coffee with real milk and I have also a small Nespresso machine.Pros:It keeps really cold - I guess around 20-30 FIt get's cold very fast - about 20 minutesIt fits a quart carton of milk - which is really my goal in the first placeYou can use it in the car which is kind of convenient.Looks cool :-)Cons:It is a bit more noisy then I expected- about the about of noise you get from the fan of a desktop computer.It does not fit anything taller then 8 inches. Which is sort of a dragAll in all an excellent item which does exactly what it says it will
2,Mini Fridge,"my 13 year old son really wanted this mini fridge to keep in his bedroom.The fridge is the perfect, small size but so LOUD!The fan is so loud he has to unplug it at night to sleep."
1,Doesn't work,"Recieved the fridge, very cute, had to buy an adapter and it had a foreign power point, and it doesnt work? my little brother is now very disapointed in his christmas present."
2,mini fridge,"Disappointed wit it. Since im frm Singapore, i nd to purchase an adapter to use it but in d end i cnt even use it as d fridge doesn't work. How do i get it chg???"
4,Love the Koolatron Mini Fridge,"I went in search of a mini fridge I could keep under my desk at work in order to escape the jockeying for the regular dorm-sized refrigerator we all share (and the inevitable mystery food that evolves there after people abandon their old ""offerings""). Anyway, my Coca-Cola styled fridge is the hit of the office. It keeps my lunch cold, and in the event I ever want to take it on the road, I've tested the in-car feature and it works great. Capacity: I usually keep 2 cans of pop on the shelf, which leaves me enough room for a sandwich and some other small (roughly 8-12 oz. size) tupperware-type goodie beneath the shelf. The shelf easily slides right out, though, if you need to cram anything larger in there (which I've also done). Another ""cool"" feature is that w/ the flip of a switch on its side, it will change over to ""warm"" mode. If it were just a smidgen bigger, I'd give it 5 stars, although if given a choice between having it or not, I'm VERY HAPPY I bought it!"
3,OK - not great!,"I bought this for my office just for my lunch and milk.It doesn't get as cold as I think it should, and whatever I putin it - it smells like that! I can't figure out why, but my guesswould be the cold factor."
3,Cool but not cold,"Overall I am reasonably happy with this mini-fridge. I now have cool drinks at hand whenever I want one.On the down side, while it cools. It does not make them cold. I would guess the drinks are about 20-30f lower then room temperature."
2,Product stopped working,"When I bought this fridge refurbisheed I thought that at least I would have a while before the product stopped working. When I got it, even after following the stated directions, the mini fridge stopped working after a week. But I have to admit, it was a cool fridge I just wish it continued to work. I didn't get any hassel about wanting to return the fridge. In fact I just got my refund today."
1,Won't last long,"Reading through all these reviews, I must be glad that my mini-fridge lasted actually about two years. That's not enough, considering the price. Plus, the thing is molded, unless you get the dremel out it's impossible to change the Peltier element."
2,not cold enough...,"We needed a fridge for a small cabinet upstairs for milk for our morning coffee. This isn't really cold enough... milk will go bad in about three days. Also, even though it is in a cabinet, I wasn't happy with the sound of the fan or motor. We got rid of ours."
4,Great little cooler for the workplace,"I don't know how well this cooler would do on the road in a hot car, but for a small space in an office or, like me, a workshop or studio, this is just perfect. The sodas are plenty cold enough. Just remember to replace what you remove. It takes three or four hours for the drink to get really cool, so rotating your stock of sodas is a good idea. One thing that is not mentioned is that all the necessary cords ARE included - ac and car. Get it. You'll like it."
3,Teeny-tiny Fridge,"It cools a bottled water to a fine drinking temp. It does not do a good job of keeping food cold in office temp conditions. If the ambient temp is 75 degrees, the fridge contents are just cool. I didn't trust my tuna and mayo sandwich after realizing that...but to have a cold drink handy, it's great!PS This thing died after about 11 months. Per customer service, the part I need to make it cool again costs more than the original price. Since all it did was sit for 11 months, longevity is NOT a strong suit for this item. Would not buy again."
3,"Cute, but limited...","If you expect refrigerator-quality cooling, this isn't for you. It's cute and quiet, but only cools to ~54F where a standard refrigerator cools to ~43F. So good enough for sodas, but not so great for dairy products!"
1,Short lived happiness,"When I got this fridge, I was really excited to get it set up at my work desk. It was fantastic to have cold drinks right at my drink knowing people wouldn't be able to sneak a couple out here and there from the communal fridge. It does take an hour to get everything down to the right temperature, but when it got there, it was great. About 4 months in, the fridge stopped working. With enough reports of this kind of thing happening in the review, just save your money."
1,horrible.. don't waste your money!!,"I bought this for my son who loves Coca Cola stuff. This thing worked for a couple of months, then the fan got louder and louder. We took it out and air sprayed the dust office, nothing. We left unplugged for month, nothing. What a waste of 50.00. Amazon would not replace and Koolatron had like a 30 day return. JUNK!!!!"
4,Well made and works great!,Bought this for my grandpa to have at the nursing home to keep a couple of drinks cold. Perfect size and does keep drinks decently cold. The only reason I gave it four instead of five is that it takes two hands to close it...you cannot simply push it shut but have to pull the latch again to secure it properly.
3,It's OK,"This is cute and fits a small space well. It was purchased for an elderly woman who doesn't bother to get up and get water out of the fridge - even though she is supposed to drink it all day long - and she says she can't drink it if it is not ice cold. We placed this by her lounge chair and stocked it with small water bottles and juice. It does not get ice cold, but reading the information pamphlet that came with it, it says it only gets about 10 degrees colder than the ambient temperature of the space it is located in. Well, as a non-mobile, small, elderly woman occupies the same room as the refrigerator, the room is kept uncomfortably warm and therefore we do not think this will ever get ""ice cold"". She uses it though....for cokes and seven up."
4,Midnight Syndicate - The 13th Hour,"What's more fun than a haunted house? A haunted Victorian mansion! That is the premise for this CD and it works surprisingly well. This is another strong effort from the artistic duo known as Midnight Syndicate. You get mysterious footsteps, creaking doors, and wispering voices along with some hair raising music and sound effects. My favorites tracks on this CD are ""Cold Embrace"" with its heavy, plodding rhythm line and ""The Lost Room"" which also has a heavy bass line that drives the piece at a fairly fast pace. Just close your eyes and imagine running down a dark hallway with nothing but a candle to light your way, evil spirits in hot pursuit. This is the kind of music that sets your imagination free. Definitely worth your money."
3,Good background music,"I was somewhat disappointed with the cd. I was hoping for something more spookier. This is a compilation of eerie music. Great for background music at our Halloween party, but not spooky or scary."
5,Instrumental music cd is great for Halloween party,Cd provides great instrumental background music for Halloween parties. It is well done and some excerpts can give one moments to pause when decorating at home alone.
3,Small book,"Lessons are easy to follow, and contain adequate instructions. Some of the scenes the aurthor chose are ugly, but that's a personal thing."
1,dried out,"This mascara was totally dried out. The packaginglooked really old but I opened it, tried it outand threw it in the trash!"
4,Great book!,"Peter Egan at his best. If your not already a motorcycle guy, this book will turn you into one. Great read!"
4,"Rated as good read, an enjoyable collection of magazine column stories.","Peter Egan is the author of the Side Glances column in Road & Track magazine and the Leanings column in Cycle World magazine. He is noted by his readers as having a self-deprecating, ironic, and sometimes dark sense of humor, including detailed accounts of the failings of his vehicles."
5,Helluva good book,"This one is truly the best of Peter Egan's writing. The second version isn't nearly as good as this one; the real classics are in here. Of course, if you're really a fan of his writing, you'll get both of them, and probably all the Side Glances ones too. But the earlier writing is better in general."
5,If motorcycling is more than just simple transportation to you...,"...then buy this book! Sensitive, humorous..a joy to read! Leanings II is sure to be on my Christmas list this year.."
3,another avid motorcyclist,It was a mediocre read The last few chapters related more to centering on the authors ego than the actual gist of riding a motorcycle
3,Input circuitry badly designed,"The input can be a problem:Line level - gain not very adjustable, many sources will over or under drive itMic level - not compatible with anything but cheap plug-N-power mics. If your mic has a battery in it (like the Sony ECM-MS957), it won't work.For cheapie electret mics or adjustable-line-level sources (a walkman, radio, or voice recorder) this should be all you need. And, anything better is ridiculously expensive."
1,Not worth buying or reading,"While I disagree with much of the content of this book, that is not why you shouldn't buy this book. The reason not to buy is that this book is greatly out-dated. It was from before 9-11, and the neo-con perspective and focus on the world is now quite different."
2,"Good release, bad series","This Blue ray set has 8 episodes on the first disk and 3 episodes + extras on the second.Funimation has come a long way in terms of quality of their releases. Eden of the East is a poor series, it's worth one watch through at most. The story is complete garbage that doesn't go anywhere. Characters are typical cookie cutter anime personalities. The series has absolutely no content, builds up to a non-existent climax that left me clueless about the ending.The animation has solid colors, but lacks everything that makes a well animated series look good and enjoyable watch.If you're looking to add some blu-ray Anime to your collection, there are other series out there that are worth the money."
1,This book was pretty bad,"This is one of the worst romances I have ever read. How any woman could fall for the guy who treats her like dirt the whole time is beyond me. And then all of a sudden at the end, he decides to tell her he loves her. At least make the story believeable. Come On!"
1,50 Scroll Saw Projects,"I am sorry I bought this book. There is nothing in it I want to make. Not saying it is a lousy book, but if I could have looked through it before buying I would have passed on it. Others may like the projects included in the book. That is the hazard of buying a how to book sight unseen."
5,This book was the best!,"I truly loved this book. I knew I would like it from the start. I cried half way through the book to the end. I felt so emotional, but happy. The ending was vey well written and I enjoy every word I read. I recommend this book to people 10 and up. Thanks!!!"
4,A very compelling and sad story of a love triangle!,I enjoyed this book thoroughly and would recommend it to all lovers of non-fiction.
1,Did not receive the dress in the package,"All I received was the package with the picture of the dog in the dress, but NO DRESS!!!!!!!!!! It was empty. I don't know who packed it, but they forgot the dress."
3,Bait and switch,"As you can see from the other reviews, the book is written from the perspective of a bleeding heart liberal. Nothing wrong with that. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. But since I found the book in the writing section of Barnes an Noble amongst other books purely about the craft of writing I felt cheated. The outside of the book does not inform you of her slant. That's just not right. I just wanted some writing tips, not a political agenda. Shame on the publisher."
4,goog,everything was what the description said. it has all the material in it i need. and it meets the requirements for my course.
1,Beware!,"I ventured into this book knowing full well that Hertzberg is what we Conservatives call a bleeding-heart Liberal. But, as a former executive secretary of the Conservative Party, I enjoy a good political debate, and I was aware of Hertzberg's strong reputation as a writer. The book began with some innocuous comments on music and Woodstock. Then came a long essay on the strengths and weaknesses of Jimmy Carter. Surprise! I found I agreed with much of what Hertzberg had to say. But then came a strongly biased diatribe on my main man Ronald Reagan. This mean spirited attack on one of the greatest Presidents who ever served was more than I could stomach. I oppose book burning, but this tome is a strong counter-argument. No matter how bad I find a book, I usually manage to finish it. This is one of only a handful of exceptions."
1,It insulted my intelligence.....,"I picked up a copy in a local thrift store after reading the jacket and being intrigued by a woman facing life's changes in middle age. After about 40 pages of prose with improbable plot turns laced with enough sugar to make one gag, the final blow was the heroine's purchase of a cute little green Firebird in which to navigate the rural Canadian wilderness in the wintertime. Since this wasn't billed as a fantasy, I put it down. It was already apparent where the story was going and I can't say I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to sacrifice IQ points along the way.. No wonder the author wrote under an assumed name."
1,Overrated and poorly written.,"I feel that Harvest Moon was one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. It was superficial and trite. The plot was predictable and simple, and left nothing to the imagination. It was a cheap imitation of Bridges. It was insulting to my intelligence, and my teenage daughter could have written a more complelling storyline."
3,An enjoyable story,"Maggie is a forty-five year old woman with two children that are on their own, and a husband that has abandoned her for a much younger woman. Her life is falling apart. Then she finds them. The letters are all bound together and still smell like her first loves cologne...the one person whose heart she broke. The letters bring back all the memories of their past together and the time they spent at Harvest Moon during the summers. She decides to go back to Canada, back to her first love, Rob. However, things are not as she thought they would be. After buying the Harvest Moon and deciding to remodel, she finds out that her first real love has died. But he lives on in his son, Eliot, and soon Maggie is wondering how she is falling in love with her first love's son, and what she should do.I enjoyed the book and recommend it for others who have enjoyed other books by K.C. McKinnon (who is Cathie Pelletier). It is a book about love and relationships and has a very happy ending."
2,Don't set your hopes too high.,"If you're looking for a quick overview of PM, this may work for you. I was dissapointed at the gaps that are in the book and the obvious things that were left out. If you just want to get a quick, simple web page up, get another book, this one won't get you there without a lot of answers coming from another source. With all due respect to the author, this volume feels rushed and incomplete."
1,Sad..,Let me Say one Thing...Joey Lawrence...you CAN'T Sing You Sound like 8 diff people Trying to sing one song..you should really just stick to acting personaly i do not own any of his stuff but i was on amazon and i stumbled upon this and listened to the samples and i must admit...i laughed very hard when i heard joey trying to sing..it was really funny but thats about it..if you have a brain in your head you will stay away from the junk if you want to hear some real music you should check out westlife...leave this hasbeen loser alone and i STRONGLY ADVISE YOU DO NOT EVEN LISTEN TO THE SAMPLES well unless you want a good laugh! hahaha
4,Delightful conversations with a reformer still at work!,"Timothy Lull, seminary president and Luther scholar and friend, lets us in on five fleeting but insightful, instructive, probing and sometimes quite humorous conversations with the 16th century reformer whose wisdom and faith still shape the Church today. In one conversation Lull has an honest talk with Luther about the still painful subject of his diatribes against the Jewish people of his day. This book provides a nice introduction to folks who would like to meet Luther for the first time. And it provides fresh perspective for those who have had their own conversations and debates with Luther along the way."
2,Buyer beware.,"Having been intrigued by this disc for quite some time, I finally went out and bought it. The main reason this disc looked appealing was the Pigpen/Janis duet. However, in the end, I shouldn't have bought this disc. There is a LOT of background noise to the songs on this disc, though the song selection is superb.Another thing that irked me about this disk was the complete lack of liner notes. The only this disc says about the music on here, is: what bands sing what songs, and that this music was recorded live on campuses in the 60s and 70s. I personally would have liked some info on the Joplin/Dead combo, but like the disc as a whole it was another disappointment.In the end, this disc sounds like a bad Grateful Dead bootleg, so if you like those, then I guess you will enjoy this disc."
4,Excellent.,"This video is excellent. It is the basics which is exactly what I need. I've had no training whatsoever. I'm glad this arrived two days before I got my bokken. I would have taught myself some bad habits.There is lots of great instruction on here. That being said it is VERY instructional. There is nothing exciting other than it's instructional benefit. I only gave it a four because it is a bit boring but, it does the job. It instructs you on Japanese swordsmanship. I am learning from it. I will be buying the rest of the series."
2,Not worth the money,"This Moppel light is much smaller than it looks. 3-inch legs and 6-inch neck. The light is very minimal/poor. Not suitable for reading or much else. Maybe as a toy, but i cannot see it being fun either. It has a cord that attaches to a battery box that has to be drug around with it - very annoying. Maybe if you zip-tie the battery box to the body that would eliminate the issue.I liked the magnetic feet that also come with suction cups..although suction cups never work for me. However, the legs are so small that you really can only attach them to the same level surface - same plane. Maybe it would be good for working on the car when trying to see in difficult spots (using the magnetic feet and adjustable neck).In all, if they got rid of the battery box (made it a part of the body) and improved the light intensity. Then it would be worth it."
3,Super Reader,"James Bond updated for the 1980s. He is no longer 007, as that section of MI6 no longer exists. M still uses him to solve problems, and here is sent to Scotland to investigate a nuclear physicist.The crazy supervillain scheme in this book is the planned terrorist takeover of a bunch of nuclear plants."
1,"Bad Theory, Worse Practice","Dr. Moats' theories have been excitedly received by politicians (particularly those with very strong conservative views) and slavishly followed by publishers. These interests claim her work to be informed by scientific research and met by strong results.Sadly, not only is Dr. Moats' classroom experience and research questionable, she also fails to take any notice of linguistic theory. Most damagingly, she is an adherent to the widely discredited theory of language deficit hypothesis. This theory, which was stunninngly debunked by Labov in the 1950s, states simply that children who speak dialects other than Standard American English lack a true language and require both remedial education and lots of phonics.Dr. Moats seems entirely unaware of this hypothesis' thorough debunking, since she never bothers to make any kind of argument as to why she believes it to be true. This arrogance is problematic."
3,Should have been more included here,"A Danzig DVD compiling a bunch of the former Misfits and Samhain frontman's videos has always been on the wishlist of many, but Archive De La Morte sadly comes up short. Besides the videos compiled here, there are no other extras, which for Danzig fans, is a crying shame. The videos that are here include three different versions of ""Dirty Black Summer"", two versions each of ""How the Gods Kill"" and ""Bodies"", three versions of ""It's Coming Down"", an unreleased video for the beautiful ""Sistinas"", and the hit live cut of ""Mother"". However, there's nothing else here after that, and anything, whether it be perhaps a ""making of"" for one or two of the videos, or an interview with Glenn himself discussing the alternate takes of the videos, and they would have been more than welcome here. Archive De La Morte is without a doubt worth checking out for Danzig fans and worth picking up for hardcore fans, but regardless you'll be left wanting more."
3,not what i had in mind,"I am a big danzig fan , upon hearing about this DVD I was thrilled , the videos for ""bodies"" are nice and also ""how the gods kill"" & ""mother"". but I don't need to see three versions of the same video that are practically the same. and some of the videos are just bad. Glenn , this is 2003 and the babes have changed since 88. love your music but you can charge a little more and put out a good DVD."
4,Much meatier and more serious than I expected,"Perhaps influenced by the plethora of off-the-wall books such as Freakonomics, Blink, etc, I was probably expecting something a little more light-hearted. This is in fact a deadly serious look at an enormous range of the risks inherent in living on this planet, most of which I was utterly and blissfully unaware of and wish I had remained so. I'll keep it on the shelf but I won't read it too often - it's too scary. I'll only refer to it for a specific enquiry. Very well-researched and compiled. Hope the authors are not too depressed now. Heavvyyyy!"
4,Art Lover's Book,This is a new and expanded edition. This is not a general guide book. This focuses on the art and architecture of Venice. There are lots of excellent pictures of various paintings.All churches and other sites are located on excellent quality maps at the end of the book.This book is probably best studied before you go. Find the sites you want to see and find a convenient way to visit several of these during the days of your visit.This book will be dry and academic to readers who aren't art buffs.
2,It ain't grackle proof.....,"We bought this feeder because it said it would also keep squirrels and nusiance birds (grackles, etc.) from eating al the feed. Well...it took the grackles about two days to figure it out and now they empty it in about an hour, even after removing all the counter weights. If you only have squirrel problems, this feeder works great. If you also have grackle and jay problems, forget it...get something cheaper."
4,Good product,"It is as good as you are at target pratice. It can be damaged by hitting the holder instead of disk. But for the price , its great."
4,inspiration and hope for the alcoholic,"Bishop Fulton Sheen is recorded in three separate lectures (1.5 hours total run time) he presented for television on the causes and cures for alcoholism. The lectures were recorded in the late '50's and early '60's.I found them to be inspiring- especially in that Sheen addresses the spiritual aspects of the condition, and how a person needs an active spiritual life to cure the condition. He stresses the strong willingness that is needed for the patient to be sober- a desire to be sober. That, along with faith in God, can heal a person.He gives personal actual stories of people he has known and relates how alcohol damaged their lives; and how their lives improved by being sober. Finally, he shows that in order to be sober, a person has to take responsibility for their sobriety."
2,Disappointed,I bought this in May 2005 and thought it OK until I realized that the display was deteriorating rapidly. Apparently the plastic is reacting to the sun screen and bug deterrent I put on my face and ears.
2,Not very useful for someone proficient with the Internet,"This book might serve as a useful guide for someone who has not done any reading of reliable sources online, however for the more discriminating reader, this book does not offer meaningful information about which medications may be more useful for certain scenarios. It doesn't offer much value over a thorough reading of online resources."
4,Good read,Good beach book. Entertaining with a hint of mystery. Relaxing without taxing your brain. Will purchase more of her books.
3,Self help to succeed at obeying the Ten Commandments.,"I am not usually thrilled with self-help books, but I bought this one. I think it was a wise purchase. It provides psychological reasons for keeping the Ten Commandments as they are written in Exodus. It gives reasons designed to motivate compliance. The Ten Challenges also provided a slant on the meaning of the words that is not available outside of Classical Hebrew. As with most all self-help books, it is meant to be read and reread, over and over again."
2,Didn't work for me. Maybe you.,"I did a month supply and did not see any improvement or feel different. I did not change my diet at all, other than adding the Primal Defense each day, and I experienced no weight loss, energy boost, superhuman powers or even a wholesome feeling. Others may get results, but it did nothing for me. I don't feel ripped off, as others had at least some results and I took my chances."
5,Thanks!!,Received in great time. Really appreciate it; great value for the amount in bottle compared to other companies selling this product. Thanks again.
4,Wish someone had told me...,"These pills are huge! If you can't swallow pills well, don't get this. There's no way they will go down my throat. I've been putting the powder in applesauce, but I'm sure that reduces the effectiveness somewhat. The contents of the capsule don't taste like anything. It's like eating several mouthfuls of dirt."
5,Great Product! Highly Recommend!,"I've only been on this probiotic for about a week - but already (and I find this hard to believe myself) - I feel BETTER! I don't know how it could work so fast - but I have NO indigestion and have noticably more energy! And this is on just one capsule a day! I'm so excited about this product, which was recommended to me by a coworker, when I complained about the frequency of the colds/viruses I get. My immunity seemed to be shot. She's been on this product for a couple of years and she can't remember her last cold, so I thought I should give it a try. So far, I'm more than pleased and will put this product on auto-delivery - it's that good!"
5,Here is to your health,"This works great to help me stay well. Prior to using this I was very sickly all the time. This is well worth the money, keeps you away from making the doctors money. Arrived quickly and as decribed."
2,1st Shipping Then quality,I purchased this product with the thinking that it would be convenient to have if my ball was just out of reeach in the water. The first Retriver I received had the round orange part broken off. I assumed it occured duing shipping. The box did not have any paper or padding surrounding it and was able to flop around inside the box. I returned it and promply recieved a replacement. Unfortunately the replacement was defective. When retracted in the compact position the first section closest to the handle would not tighten up and stay retracted. That section would slide in and out at will. I thought about keeping it then decided to return it. I decided that I do no hit into the water that often and really didn't need this product so asked for a refund instead of a replacement. The return process was very easy and prompt. the product was picked up the day after I processed the return and everything went very smoohtly.
5,Back on track,"After having over 20 lbs gone using their first book, I forgot some things about balance and order of eating. I used this book to get back on track. It really helped to read it through. They offer bits of important information about blood sugar (insulin) control in the parts of the book not directly connected to each day.As far as I'm concerned, I've found a life-long way of eating, at least until gene therapy is discovered to cure my carb addiction (:"
1,Too general,Very general information but none of the desparately needed specifics. Reads like someone's vacation monologue.
3,Not quite up to par,"A bit disappointing.....the ending was less than stunning, and the reader is more than a few steps ahead through the entire thing. Good atmosphere, etc., as usual though, and hard to put down regardless."
4,One of Perry's Best Pitt Thrillers,"I am a huge fan of Anne Perry. I have read all of her books and eagerly look forward to the next one. My actual favourite series is the William Monk series, but the Pitt ones are very good too. This particular one is a very good example of her style of writing and it would be a good book to read first in order to get into the series. Her writing puts the reader right there in Victorian England as no one else can. I never guessed what the motive could be at all and was suitably surprised with the last chapter. A really tight well-knit thriller."
2,Perry needs to take a break,"I'm a long-time fan of Anne Perry, but her last several books have left me disappointed. I had trouble getting started with this one, not because I found her plot lacking, but her writing has become flat and uninteresting. All her aristocrats are arrogant and haughty, all Pitt's underlings speak with a Cockney slang (which is very irritating to read) and she uses the word ""tragedy"" about 700 times in each book. Pitt is becoming one-note and all her secondary characters seem to blend together. Perry in earlier works drew interesting and unique characters. Now, she seems to be on automatic pilot filling in the blanks with no thought to originality and raking in the profits. While I enjoy her plots tremendously, this book in particular showed that Ms. Perry has fallen into the formula trap and she needs some time away from her word processor."
4,Not my favorite,This isn't her best work but even second best from Perry is better than most mystery authors. I enjoyed it but was able to put it down which is usually not the case with her books.
2,Disappointing,"I love the Pitt and Monk series by Anne Perry but both have moved away from the drawing room style of story and into a more political realm. This one wasnt even interesting; I didnt care at all about the presumed target, Charlotte was a peripheral character, Radley a jerk and Emily a snot. The 'whodunnit' aspect was totally missing and the whole thing rather flat. The books have begun to veer away from what makes them so good--strong believable characters, an intimate, absorbing plot and more domestic types of crime."
1,"If you ever go outside, this phone's not for you","This phone is useless outside of a quiet room. Don't bother calling anywhere from a sidewalk -- especially if the wind's blowing. I can't tell you how many people have said, ""it sounds like you're calling from behind an airplane,"" or ""where are you? at a concert?"". Oh, yeah, and the camera's weak, too."
2,Nice looking but..,"Pretty good phone, but if I had a choice in choosing I wouldn't pick it. Only because it's kind of small, elegant true, but the buttons are kind of hard to press and ""squeaky"" the joystick is alright but I prefer my Nokia N70, it's easy to use and has a large screen, also it's fun because it has features, I can make mini videos and the camera is excellent, There are better sony erricsson phones out there!"
1,T-616 sucks,"The phone sucks big time!!! I don't know why they have the camera in it, at first place.. The camera is useless.. AT&T also sucks.. I had to leave the county and wanted to unlock my phone.. They don't do that for you.. Whereas T-Mobile unlocks the phone for you after you are with them for about 3 months.. Cingular & AT&T both suck big time.."
4,I think this is a great book.,"At first I didn't think I was going to like this book, but it turned out to be a good book. The book contained mostly images of body builders and the same girl kept on appearing in almost all the pics. I think the photographer used good ideas for the subjects and the lighting and all the text was very usefull."
1,A waste of good paper,"This is a terrible book. I hated it so much that I couldn't stand to have it on my bookshelf and prompty took it out and left it on the street. There is no way that this book should have been published. The photographs are terrible in every way: no style, no technique - nothing. It's a shame to see paper and ink wasted on such worthless content."
2,Lisa,"Not what I expected. The movie had an awesome soundtrack but none of those songs were included. Only one song was included...All Mixed Up, which is an excellent song. The rest of songs on the soundtrack are background music basically. Not worth the price."
3,Shatter blast,I bought these to replace the glass bottles that were being broken at our little bb gun shooting range we made. I thought it was great that they were made of clay and are bio-degradable. But despite the name they did not shatter. little edges broke off and occasionally a bb put a hole in them with out doing any other damage. The only plus side of them not shattering is that you can use them over.
2,Does not shatter,"We shot these targets with a 22, 223, 40 cal and 45 cal, and most of them had to be shot several times in order to shatter. So if you want something that shatters, this is not it. Otherwise, it is a target to shoot at."
4,Shatterblast,"These are actually designed for use with BB or pellet guns but I used them with a .22 pistol. They do break well but don't really ""shatter."" If you are looking for something that explodes or at least shatters into fragments this is not it. However, if you're happy with cheap targets that break when hit and are biodegradeable then these will fit your bill."
2,"Despite McCarver's Babbling, Some Good Stories","This book is absolutely terrible, with McCarver making weak connections between moments of the season. Also, McCarver gives little evidence as to why the 1998 season was the best (what is so great about the Yankees running away with it? Great only if you're a Yankee fan). There are some good stories, but the book would be improved if McCarver just kept his feeble minded opinion out of it. I don't know how the man has an announcing job after all these years."
1,Disappointed,"What I ordered and what I got, was two different items. I have three of the same holmes air cleaners in my home and have had them for about five years now. I always order the same filters, HAP 115. For some reason these filters (although the picture shows the correct product) came without the cotton side and are a DOT too big. You have to SQUEEZE the filter into the machine. Very disappointed with my purchase."
5,We Knew It Couldn't Be a Perfect Husband ...,"When the Domestic Goddess moves to town, she not only weasels people out of their family heirlooms, she attempts to abolish slovenliness, high cholesterol and smoking - offering help where it is not wanted. She and her not-so-perfectly plump hubby open a low-end bed and breakfast, and Trixie continues to stir the plot of discontent. Constable Hamish MacBeth doesn't seem surprised when her body is inconveniently discovered. Once again the under-ambitious MacBeth annoys headquarters and the lovely Priscilla, as the red herrings mount in number and the clues point in different directions. The Hamish MacBeth books are light fare -with extremely clever writing, characterization that can only be inspired, and a sense of place set out so well the reader feels transported. I highly recommend all the books in this series."
4,Well established characters....,"This is the first Hamish McBride mystery I have read, and I really loved it! Hamish is a wonderfully understated (and underestimated) character, and the supporting characters here are really nicely developed and recognizable as small town types all over the world, not just in Scotland! There is, however, a really nice sense of ""place"" here, which I, as a fan of all things Scottish, enjoyed! The story is also simple and fun--this is a very fast read and well worth it!"
5,book,This is a well written book. The setting for the book is the Olympia area -- where I'm from. I read the book and decided to order two paperback copies as gifts.
4,Go get it --,I thoroughly enjoyed this read. The depth of information shared about sea life as the story unfolded was great. The characters were all believeable.
3,Starts fine but ultimately a washout,The story revolves around 13 year old Miles' explorations on the tidal flats of Puget Sound which is brimming with marine life. Miles makes a couple of unique finds and he and his friend Phelps brave a near tragedy while the boys prowl the nighttime bay.The information about the creatures Miles finds is interesting but does at times read like a stuffy science textbook. There is also a sense of being repeatedly smacked in the head with glaringly obvious symbolism like the sea star shaped like a cross duh! The new age tangent the story takes served only to make me yawn.There is some authentic interaction between Miles and his friends Phelps and old Florence but the same effort is not put into other characters.By the end of the book I did not like Miles very much and found some of his actions cowardly and selfish. The ending was a bit corny and rushed as well. Add two stars if you live on Puget Sound or if you are a friend of the author.
5,fabulous,lovely insight into the dawning of self appreciation as well as love of the world-and funny!
4,Poor editing on kindle edition,"I am enjoying the book, except the quality of the editing of the kindle edition is terrible! Poor formatting, and spelling to the extent that I often struggle to determine the intended meaning. I would think this was poor if the ebook was free, publishers need to ensure the quality of publishing for an ebook matches that of a paper book when they charge the same for paper and ebooks."
3,"Sturdy blanket, but not soft","It is sturdy blanket but it is scratchy. Feels a little like new blue jeans. Hopefully this blanket will get softer the more I wash it. It is a very warm blanket, though. I'm just a person that likes plush, soft material. If you are looking for warmth, this is a good blanket."
4,Learned to Love them,I liked the Bravery but when I saw them in concert I started to love them. This album of theirs to me has the same tune in every song but it's a great tune and in turn a great album.
3,Not blown away,"Review title says it all. Not a ""In Rotation"" album. Kinda mediocre to say the least.Ok, so I bought this album without listening to it first. Big mistake. Be smart, listen to its entirety first, then buy if it blows you away. I suggest you borrow it from a friend or better yet, the library."
3,customer service stinks,"Bought this as my first saw in Sept 04. After learning how to make adjustments and use the saw, I was very pleased. That is until the quick change chuck system broke. This model is no longer available at Lowe's so I was unable to exchange it for a new on. Therefore I contacted Delta customer service....I have been waiting 2 months for some ""hex nut"" to get off backorder. After several complaints, they agreed to send the entire chuck unit(3 day UPS) instead of waiting for the part. That was over a week ago and still have not received anything. The customer service made me feel as if I was being impatient, but 2 months is a long time to wait for parts. Finally, I decided to return the saw to Lowe's. They were very helpful. I was able to get a store credit for the saw, but now I am very confused as to what saw will be easy for me to use and have good customer service. I am very displeased with Delta customer service"
3,Delta Discontinues Scroll Saws,Delta has discontinued producing Scroll Saws so unless you are looking to purchase one used don't waste your time looking. This is really unfortunate. Mine finally bit the dust after 10 years. I really miss it.
3,Nice Saw For The Money! ** 3-3/4 STARS**,"Performance is very smooth and the dust collection box is a nice addition to this Delta Scrollsaw! The lower blade clamp is difficult to use due to limited area available to move fingers around in...NOT recommended for anyone with arthritis! Dust blower needs major improvement in pressure but for the money, all in all, this is a good saw. The stand reduces vibration 100 fold and the On/Off lock switch is a great idea for anyone with youngsters around. Extended table is a great improvement for supporting large, delicate fretwork pieces and the tilt table is great for beveled wood working. This is a nice improvement from my last Delta Scrollsaw but Delta still needs to make changes to the increase ""available work space"" in the lower blade clamp area to make it more ""user friendly"" before I'd consider giving it a higher rating. I've been operating a scrollsaw for over 7 years to make my living and so far... so good with this model!"
5,10 out of 10,"What upsets me is the level of artistry that both Boy Bax and Tommy (I truly enjoy Tommy's word usage and delivery in this album) totally eclipses their depth on R.andom A.ccess M.oney...I waited so long for that National Album to come out, and then it mostly let me down. After listening to it for a while, I began liking it at a nominal level (compared to my infatuation w/ Thee Album Regardless) ...If there is any doubt about this album, they must be on dimensions beyond the third...Wonderful album. From start to end. Stories, bragging, knowledge...well rounded North Philly, Richard Allen Mob production. I hope that RAM gets their act together and give their fans from since ""Unfortunate"" what they've been waiting for...Until later..."
3,"IMO, this album is a 3.5 out 5 stars.","I am not saying that this album is bad by any means. In fact, it is quite entertaining and I can at least say that Field Mob comes with some originality and comic relief on this album. I give this album 3.5 stars because it starts off with a bang, but it gets kind of redundant at the end with the repeated songs about the females. The best tracks are: Can't Stop Us, Project Dreams,Dead In Your Chevy and Channel 613 Pt.1 ( which is the funniest track, in my opinion). I recommend this album to those that enjoy hip-hop with a southern twist or just hip-hop that is different from what you are accustomed to. Though it could have been a little longer, this is a promising debut and I look forward to future Field Mob projects."
5,a good and thorough book,"overall a very good book. by the way, is there a solution manual that covers all the assigned problems in the book. i though the problems are hard enough."
4,Illinois mudder,"Recently while visiting Crested Butte I had the opportunity to test ride a bike that was equipped with Maxxis-Minions 'DHF' on both front and rear and was impressed with the traction and ride characteristics. While i'm not willing to give up my front 'dart classic' i did mount the 'DHF' on the back of my bike (scott spark) and its a great tire. For Illinois single track/cross country it gets decent traction in mud and handles roots and rocks just fine. Seems to hold its line in fast corners with just a hint of drift. The 2.35 seems true to size compared to other tires and so far i haven't had any trouble with sidewall tears, plus it rolls decent on a hard surface. Its my new current favorite rear tire!"
1,Piece of Trash,"She is for the prosecution, no matter how neutral she may seem to appear. Her opinions mean nothing to me, and neither do the ""sources' she claims to get her info from. This book sickens me. I think her book is full of lies and allegations and personal opinions and it trashes Michael Jacksons reputation for no other reason then personal glory. I rented it from the library. If you must read it, I suggest you do the same."
1,What an opportunist!,"The real travesty of justice is that fools like Diane Dimond get to publish a salicious, fiction book about a person she has never even met! If you have not met Michael Jackson, you can not tell me anything about him. And she needs to stop calling herself an ""expert"" on Michael Jackson. The only thing she is expert at is keeping her mug on TV obsessing over Mr. Jackson. She needs to get a life. And this book will flop worst than Bob Jones'."
1,So many imaginary stories.,"Man, after reading the book, i had a feeling that it was a novel/a fiction book. (for example, the author's description of the scene Dr Chandler walking through the lobby of his office building,... and so much more redundant details...)This book contains so many imaginary stories, which are, of course, against Jackson ridiculously. If Dimond wants her book to be taken seriously, she shouldn't convert it into a novel. So, we just read it for fun, i think - no credibility.Rate: 5-"
1,do not waste your money,"I have never seen a more biased book, based soley on someone's opinion who has never even met her subject! How would she know ANYTHING about Michael Jackson if she has never spoke with him. Terrible book."
3,Scary!,"This book has many scary things about Michael Jackson. In 1993, I was the same age as the first alleged victim. I remember MJ on tv, in his red shirt, saying he was innocent. It was strange hearing MJ say the word ""penis"". Back then, I couldn't tell if Mike was innocent or guilty and even now, I am still on the fence. This book was obviously written by someone who hates Michael Jackson. Many of her sources say they saw Jackson doing sexual things to these kids, but why didn't any of them call the police or intervene as it was happening? But, like this book mentions, MJ always shared his time (and his bed) with young boys despite saying he loved kids...Girls are kids, too, why didn't they get the same treatment? MJ mentioned on TV when the Culkin kids stayed over, Macaulay & Kieran slept in his bed, but their sister slept in another room. So this book isn't 100% lies, but it isn't 100% honest, either."
1,could not make it through the second chapter,"First I will admit to being a Michael Jackson fan. However, I also try and keep a open mind regarding everything I read. Just like the books where it is so clear that the writer is more a ""fan"" than a writer, its disappointing when someone who is suppose to be an objective media person write something that is clearly biased from the first page. Michael Jackon was proven not guilty and from everything else that I have read, that should have been the verdict. I could barely make it through the first chapter and no way could I continue on through the book. I should have read the other reviews before purchasing it, at least I didn't spend much on it. My advice to anyone is not waste your money."
1,Author's Perspective are Not Facts,This is book is based on speculations and interpretations and not on actual facts. The information is bias. Thankfully I did not buy it but read it at a bookstore.
4,Too much fun!,This is a great enrichment activity for kids learning French. The games are fun and the tape gives plenty of time to repeat and understand the French phrases.
5,fantastic.,Other than getting the old one off this product was a dream. At the price point I can buy three of these for the price of one at the store. Been running it for 8 months or so now and it is holding strong. No complaints. Love it. Great brand.
4,Gift Hit,"Bought this for my seven year old niece for Christmas.She loved it! The kit is small, about 7-8 small stamps, one stamp pad with both pink & purple ink, and some colored pencils. But she had a lot of fun making sweet cards for everyone. She loves her arts & crafts, but I would guess for someone who already has a large array of stamps, this set might be a little to basic. But for a young girl who loves to make cards and crafts of sorts, this is a great beginner set."
5,stamps are fun,Something I got for my son Miquel to have fun and understand the importance of friendship. Very good to have and cheap good product.
3,stamp pad,"I bought this and an extra ink pad for my grandaughter. Both ink pads were dry when she got them. I really ought to get my money back, my daughter is trying to dampen them to use them. I will in the future buy stamp sets, but not the ink pads."
1,Ink was completely dried out,"I bought three of these sets as Christmas gifts and when my kids tried to use them, the ink in all three was completely dried out. Most barely left a stamp mark; some left nothing. I even tried to moisten them with a little water, but no luck. Waste of money!"
4,Lots of Fun but beware the stamp pad!,"The stamp set is great and when my granddaughter opened it at Christmas, ALL the kids wanted to stamp everything in sight! Mostly their arms! I was glad I ordered an additional stamp pad though. The 2 colors that came with the set were dry and did not work. That was unfortunate. If I had not ordered the additional stamp pads the gift would have been useless. I don't want to return the entire set, but Melissa & Doug/Amazon shoud at least replace the color stamp pads. I'd advise everyone to be sure you have extra stamp pads or your child will be disappointed!"
1,dried up ink pad,The ink pad is very small compared to the number of stamp blocks. But worst of all I ordered this twice from Amazon and in both orders the stamp pad did not have enough ink. For an adult I had to really press hard to make a decent stamp impression on white paper. I returned both. My first bad experience with Melissa & Doug.
5,Great small toy,I got this as a small gift for my daughter so she wouldn't feel left out on my sons birthday. It's a good gift.
5,SHOCKING,IT'S ONE OF THE MOST SHOCKING MOVIES I'VE SEEN. GREAT PERFORMANCES AND SPECIALLY ORSON WELLES WITH THAT FINAL MONOLOGUE. GREAT MOVIE
4,"Not a ""deep"" book, but fun.","I enjoyed this book, even if it is total fluff. The main character, Sadie, is down on her luck. She meets a film producer who invites her to go to Los Angeles. What follows is the unrealistic fantasy most romantics have when they think of ""Hollywood.""True, it is nothing more than a bowl of frosting, but it isn't masquerading as something more either. It's a good book to read when you're having a bad day - sweet and lighthearted."
4,A Good Beach Read,"This is the perfect book to take on a plane or read at the beach. The secondary characters added a lot to this book. The plot was a bit far-fetched, but that was what made it fun."
1,Too much hype,Bottom line: most everything in the book you can find on their website. Don't waste your money.
1,The end of gouging on XBox 360 arcade sticks,"Hori is releasing a WIRELESS Virtua Fighter 5 arcade stick on August 8th, 2007 for 59.99. Why be gouged when you can get the same stick without the ""artwork"" for much, much cheaper. There is no reason to pay the $249 these scalpers are asking so DON'T DO IT!"
5,Amazing,"Jung Young Lee is a genius. He was a man before his time. His words will ring true even more so now, than it did in his day, as the world he endured was of greater marginalization for ethnic minorities, especially asian-americans.The book is rich in many points, but to summarize poorlyThe world is stuck in seeking to be the center. Individuals seek to be the center, to be dominant.Christ broke that apart and lived at the margin, became marginal and sought for the marginalized.We are called to live at the margin, become marginal, seeking for the marginalized.It's a theology of servant-hood and community.Centrality only corrupts and creates pain for its holders and its victims.When all seek to serve and become marginal, the center will collapse, and all will be made equal, and all will be as one.It is a beautiful vision, whether seen as practical or impractical."
2,Do you like poker?,"I did not enjoy this book. While I often enjoy post-apocalytic literature, this one did not grab me. I did not care about the characters, I did not like them or symphatize with them. In fact, if that is what humans come to, they deserve to see the end of the world! I could not grasp the ""magic"" idea, it was not well described in my view. Much of the book is based on the game of poker: I know nothing about that game and so I was lost in several places. I thought the writing was good but the concepts did not work. Like fantasy? Try ""The Golden Compass"" written mostly for teens but a much more interesting treatment of a similar subject."
3,"Imaginative, but not much else","I only picked this book up because I live close to Galveston. It was very creative, but that's about it. I was able to identify with the area. However that's about all that I enjoyed."
2,"Is it my imagination, or is $30 for a SERIOUSLY short book expensive?","I didn't crack this thing open...I got in the mail and laughed. It's less substantial in stature than a magazine. It might be great, but for $30, I'm certain you can do better."
5,Love it,"My husband had looked at this forever and finally decided to ""splurge!"" With the accessories, it was a better deal than any we found and we have used it a lot! Just smoked 3 turkeys for Thanksgiving and it was easy and delicious!"
4,Moving Stories About the Politics of Literacy,"Lanehart, a professor of English, writes about the impact of being labeled illiterate upon her family. With these stories she also does an analysis of the nature of literacy. A very moving and intelligent look at the impact of race and gender on how we view literacy and intelligence."
1,Slow reading,"The kea may be an interesting bird, but this book is not. As painfully tedious as a college textbook, this book lacks personality. If you need information on the kea, stick to your internet browser and spare yourself the time."
1,piece on junk,The phone gets lousy reception. It has this huge thing that plugs in to any electrical outlet and the phone jack. The actual phone doesn't have to be near the phone jack. We've replaced the battery several times in about a year. I'm looking around for a different space-saving phone.
5,An Amzing Read,"As an old friend of Jeff Conine's, I was proud to see him complete Frag's Ass. He started to germinate this book twenty years ago when we were officemates and grad students together working on our MFA's. This novel, the result of all his labors is a wonderful read, witty, caustic, smart and at times quite wise. Conine has a special eye and a special ear for the nonsense of the world, and it all comes across in this terrific novel. Congrats Dr. Conine for a wonderful book."
5,Poli Sci and Psych people must read this review!!,"Anyone who is interested in or majoring in political science or psychology should read this book. The level of character psychology and American politics is phenomenal. You won't look at either in the same light after reading this book. Institutionalizatin is exposed; American foreign policy is unveiled, and Conine's inner sensitivity to these topics reveals much about what it was like to be living in this time during the circumstance described. A MUST read for anyone who can stomach the truth about psychological disorders relating to American politics."
4,Also an entertaining book.,This book is actually fun to read. The authors style is easy to read and includes many anecdotes about his experiences working in the real world. Many times I find myself saying (in my head) yeah! yeah! as he sheds new light on the subject for me - a born again spaghetti coder. Well worth the money.
3,not as fun as the first,"I loved the first book, and the fact that the story was told so well in letters between two people. This story was fun, but the alternating viewpoint on a trip they were taking together didn't work as well for me. I found myself more intrigued by the hazards of travel during that time then by the actual intrigue. And because of his pouty behavior in the first book, I kept thinking of Thomas as a teenager - which made the married relationship just seem weird. Despite these things, I do enjoy the characters and the world created by Wrede and Stevermer, and look forward to reading the final book in the series."
3,Rather dull,"The moment i finished ""Sorcery and Cecelia or The Enchanted Chocolate Pot: Being the Correspondence of Two Young Ladies of Quality Regarding Various Magical Scandals in London and the Country"" I tried to find out if there was a sequl and to my luck there was. Unforutnaetly i found it pefectly ""odius"". It was extemely boring and it dragged on an on. Though the romance between Thomas and Kate was cute it was dull. It wasn't as fun as in Sorcery and Cecilia. I think they tried to hard. I'm sorry. If you want to read it its fairly good but my suggestion is to read the first one and leave it at that."
4,As good a sequel as can be expected.,"I must say I LOVED Sorcery and Cecelia. It is one of my favorite books which is why I wasn't expecting the sequel to be as good. It wasn't. Oh, it was still a good fantasy novel, but the plot seemed to drag and was a bit confusing in some parts. Cecy, who was so much fun in the previous book, is overshadowed by Kate. Kate seems to have all the entries in the book and all the good parts. Cecy only gets her share towards the end of the nearly 500 page novel. The plot was still good and exciting near the end, but it did seem about 100 pages too long. Still, if you are dedicated Kate and Cecy fan, read it since it is the sequel, but definitely don't start with this book. It is fun, but not anywhere near as good as the first."
3,"Not bad reference for Cisco ""security"" products","This book contains information of Cisco security family products. To me, they are quite general and not in-depth. If you want to master the products, you'd better look for other resources on the Internet."
3,Not up to Rendell Expectations,Enjoyed the book as a bit of 'light' reading to fill up a few hours of relaxing. Thought it was slow and rather boring.
3,Put on by Cunning by Ruth Rendell,It just wasn't up to her usual sneakiness I saw it coming. I am still a fan of ruth so I'll keep on.Chandler Smith.
3,Standard Rendell,The customary entertaining and attention-holding mystery from Ruth Rendell. The rather bizarre characters lead one to wonder if there really are people like that in our world.
4,put on by cunning ruth rendell,"good style wavering between excessive detail at times to rather abrupt cut offs. took quite a while to get into the story,this is my first wexford novel,or maybe not, but a character well crafted where events occur around him to his good fortune"
1,Precisely What's Wrong with America,"The arrogant self-righteousness of this book is precisely 1). The reason so many countries hate the US; and 2). The reason we have the problems we have today. This is simply the nativist chest beatings of an intolerant and not very well informed observer, out to make money with a simplistic and downright silly argument. Don't contribute to the author's income by buying this laughably unsophisticated and crass book. It is not even worthy of one star."
3,Ok,Was looking for the bubble gum flavored one's. These are ok. Does the job. Wife is ok with it for now
4,great,"studied the style for awhile , I was very happy with the volumes and was surprised when they covered something I havent covered"
5,Modern Fairy Tales,"This the lowdown on Moray: the man is only 21 and has an undying love for old, traditional English folk ballads. So, what does he choose to do? He compiles a number of songs, mostly covered by the most revered traditionalists of that genre, and brings to them the sound and instruments that you would expect a 21 years old to be immersed in. The thing that makes this whole album exceptional is that each song is a marriage of modern and old, without a hint of hibridity, songs brought to life by a different breath and sensibility. Sweet England, ""April Morning"" or ""Longing For Lucy"" are prime examples of that. Electronica, in some cases, or an electric guitar, help create modern fairy tales."
4,*sob*,"I think enough has been said about the virtues of this book, instead, I ask you to share my pain at discovering that this book is out of print.I foolishly loaned my copy to a friend who moved Zurick, and he seems to have lost it in the move. Thinking I would have little trouble replacing it, I didn't let it bother me until I discovered that the book was not easy to replace. Two years later I stand before you a broken and bitter man.My God, my god, why have you foresaken me?!"
3,Not a lot of ASL,"I bought this tape primarily for the sign language. While Marlee Matlin is on for a few seconds and Steve signs a bit, the focus is very much on directional signs, NOT sign language. These are good Blue's episodes, we love Blue, but for learning to sign......keep looking."
5,Not for Women Only!,"As I flipped through the Harvard Business Review's Top Ten Business Books Of 2000 , I was intrigued by the review of ""The Shadow Negotiation"". Having a background in sociology, my curiosity was piqued by the book's focus on gender issues and interpersonal communication.It turned out to be a riveting read and I lost count of the number of times I thought ""Hey, that's happened to me!""The Shadow Negotiation teaches by example, and delves into the psychological and social intracacies of negotiation. This book has enriched my understanding of the layers of negotiations that occur long before arriving at the table.This book is for both sexes, and applies to all sorts of negotiations that pop up in everyday life. As a consultant, I have applied it to my salary negotiations, and find that I can manage my business relationships with much greater confidence. A wonderful gift to all of your working friends and family!"
5,Clever Packaging of Some Life-Changing Ideas,"The book designers have outdone themselves with the handsome, clever ""look"" of this new book. But ""The Shadow Negotiation"" is a whole lot more than a pretty package---it's one of those rare cases where the style and substance actually match! The authors lay out a new framework for understanding what really goes on in a negotiation, and what you can do to improve things. Organization theorists and negotiation scholars will be citing this book for years to come---but the average reader (us working stiffs, men and women alike) will benefit immediately from the terrific illustrations (the authors really know how to tell an engaging story) and useful, easy-to-understand guidance this book offers. Sure, it's a ""how-to"" book---but like ""Getting to YES,"" it's a whole lot more. This is a page-turner of a book that could result in some life-changing experiences."
5,Insightful personal journey,"An insightful personal journey in which the author brilliantly conveys how, in the course of investigating her older sister's murder, she discovers her own repressed feelings about the senseless death, while at the same time attempting to extricate herself from her marriage with a loving, but volatile man. The book is beautifully written in a style which conveys not only the author's personal issues but also allows the reader to ponder such thought provoking universal issues as death, love, family, revenge, grief and rage."
5,MOST EXCELLENT PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE CITY,This exceptionally beautiful and artistic photography book shows us the gem that New York City is. A great coffee table conversation piece. I wish I could buy the actual photos and frame them to put around my home. This photographer has a true gift and an incredible eye. Clearly he also loves and celebrates the power and grace of the city. I love looking at the photograpphs over and over again.
1,It really is THAT bad.,"I hate to review a movie from a beloved series so poorly but this really was one of the worst/most boring/painful to watch films I've ever seen. It doesn't even deserve cult status. I watched it recently with a fellow Futurama/Simpsons fanatic and about 3/4th of the way through the movie we looked at each other and asked, ""should we turn this off now or keep waiting for a joke?"" We finished it, but I felt like it was a complete, mind-numbing waste of time. Frequently I enjoy movies that others found worthless or tasteless, but this one has no merit whatsoever. Don't destroy your opinion of the regular Futurama series by watching it. Bender's Big Score is far better."
3,Milked for Money,"I have heard that after all 4 dvds are released that they will be televised as 12 episodes on some cable network.This would be a short season. How much does a season on dvds cost?$20 to $30 bucks. How much are you paying for these dvds which equal 3 episodes= $19.99!Won't they eventually put all these ""episodes"" into one set eventually?Do the math and wait on this and the others"
4,Good,"I'm surprised by the wide range in ratings. ""Death Ball"" by itself is worth three stars! Anyway, I thought this was better than Bender's big score which seemed kind of hacky and recycled to me. This is actually starting to feel like the old Futurama. It was a little slow to get started, hence the 4 stars, but I thought it was great once the main story kicked in. I can tell the writers, actors and animators are quickly getting their groove back, especially when compared to BBS which I thought was weak on all counts.Also, no Al Gore this time thank god. That's an automatic 2 star right there people!"
1,Disappointing at best,"At first I thought the movie was going to be as good as ""Bender's Game."" About the time right after the Madison Cube Garden scene everything went down south. This movie is not worth buying, unlike the other two, and a big disappointment from the first movie."
3,Muh...,"I enjoyed Bender's Big Score, it was wonderful to see Futurama again but the Beast was bad. Really bad. It suffers from alot of the later Futurama Eps. The whine on about Fry and trying to find love. One movie was fine for that but two is going to far. While there were a few good gags it is clear these are 3-4 eps tied together kind of like the Simpsons movie."
3,Good ol Futurama,"Not as knee slapping funny as Benders Big Score, but I feel that it is a very funny, touching movie."
2,Bad,"Futurama is my favorite animated show of all time, but this movie was just bad. It is not funny."
3,"Hate to say it, but...","Excellence is fragile. The two Futurama episodes made since the cancellation of the TV series have not met the high standards the writers and producers set for themselves. The voices and design of the characters remain the same, but the writing and even much of the animation is sub-par. You WILL notice the difference. But if, like many fans, you must have more and will take what you can get, then by all means indulge yourself and buy The Beast."
2,Not that good,"I am the kind of guy who loves futurama. I think some futurama is better that no futurama at all. And yet, this really is not a very good episode/movie. It is more a bunch of jokes put together with no clear purpose and then put together in a hurry using a stupid plot. As far as I am concerned futurama was a ""real"" sitcom that just happened to be setup in the future which allowed for jokes that would otherwise be nonsensical in a different setting. Well if you are like me, who thinks the first 6~9 seasons of the simpsons were good until it just got to be a bunch of nonsense put together about the wacky adventures of Homer, well this is exactly what the beast with a billion backs is. It has no character interaction, the story does not flow, it just sucks (I am sorry to say)."
2,Not That Good!,"This movie was a big disappoitment compared to the release of ""Bender's Big Score"". The humor in this one was limited, the story line was almost non-existent and was an all around a big disappointment. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because even bad Futurama is better than no Furturama at all."
3,"Kind of good, but a lot like a ""normal"" R.L. Stine book.","I liked the story a whole lot, but the ending was really kind of stupid. Actually, I do recommend reading this book, because the events leading up to the ending are pretty cool."
1,too rosy of a picture,"I am going to quote Aihwa Ong - Antrhopology Professor from UC Berkeley who criticized ""Modernity at Large"" since I cannot state it any better than her:""When an approach to cultural globalization seeks merely to sketch out universalizing trends rather than deal with actually existing structures of power and situated cultural processes, the analysis cries out for a sense of political economy and situated ethnography.""Appadurai is essentially Thomas Friedman in a graduated sense for academia."
4,Last Mohicans Needs to be Digitally Remastered on DVD,"I love Randolph Scott in this role. The movie is superior to Daniel Day Lewis' modern version. The problem with the film is the quality is choppy in a couple of places where the Master film was eroded and apparently spliced.I rated this 4 star based on the Mater film's condition not the quality of the acting, directing and the movie itself. They need to get a better Master film and digitally restore it and put onto a DVD. I would pay triple for such a quality DVD production."
4,Outstanding Adaptation of a Classic,"This is an excellent adaptation of Fenimore Cooper's classic about the French and Indian War - superior, I think, to the much more violent Daniel Day Lewis version. The cast members give strong performances and there is a great deal of dramatic tension. I shall never forget the scene where Heather Angel leaps off a cliff to escape the murderous Magua. My only complaint is that the film is not available on a quality DVD. I hope that is soon remedied. Highly recommended for fans of the genre."
4,classic 1st movie,one of the best movie lines of the new world. Classic story and the film was in good condition. I would buy it again.
1,"Bad print quality, skip this one",This book is really hard to read ... almost as if it was a bad photocopy. Seek out a different ISBN on the same topic.
2,Lame!,"This is a lame collection. Some of the tracks sound really muffled and bad. The songs could easily fit onto one disc instead of two. Instead of a discography, there is a sketchy history of Haymes the celebrity, with no mention of musical considerations. The artwork is hideous: a caricature that bears no resemblance to the man. This works only as a casual introduction to the crooner."
3,Generic.....use only for lens protection,You get what you pay for. This filter should only be used for protecting a lens from damage. It does not help with flares. Use a multi-coated filter for that. I use this lens filter as a backup in case of emergencies. I would not use it if directed at a light source.
3,not really squirrel proof,"very sturdy bird feeder but squirrels have figured out how to lift the cover and feed from the top. So while this is a beautiful feeder, the squirrels get more of the bird seed than the wild birds."
3,Disturbing Elements in Story,"I was really happy to see a new Laura Kinsale book in the store. It is well-written, and most of the characters are complex and interesting. A few, such as Zafer, Margaret, and Dario, are not fleshed-out enough. I was disappointed to find that all of the sex scenes are sadistic in nature. Most of the sadism is on the part of the heroine. I could perhaps accept that this might happen the first one or two times, in the context of the story, but couldn't understand why it continued once Allegreto and Elena fell in love. I found it disturbing."
4,Great for new ipods. Not so for 3rd Gen. ipods.,"I love this item and feel I got it for a great price at about $[...] bucks!BUT........I have an older 3rd Generation ipod and some of the music does not play properly. I tried a friends newer ipod and it plays perfectly.Seems music downloaded from the internet plays great. Music downloaded from CD's, is distorted. Can't figure out why other than it has something to do with older ipods.Either way, it's a really good ipod player and worth the price."
3,"Great Sound, but may want more features.","I purchased this based on other reviews. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase considering the price paid. I thought about getting a system with a radio built in and still think that might have been the way to go. However, if you do not need a radio, I like this system. The sound is very good. Good base. Solid sound. The remote works well from across the room (20- feet or so). My only complaint is that sometimes when I put the Ipod on the unit and turn it on, the sound is at near full volume. It was at a very low level when I turned it off and removed the Ipod previously. That being said, I purchased two units, one for work and one for home and transport the Ipod between the two every day. They both get lots of use and sound great."
4,One problem only,"This is a GREAT portable sound system. The only catch is that when I dock my ipod on there, the system initially goes to max volume and blares out whatever the ipod is playing until I can manage to reduce the volume through the volume control button. Very cute remote."
3,Great sounding dock w/ a bit of buzz w/ no signal (but not for iphone 3.0 or Moto Cliq),"This is a great airy sounding dock that works well with your iphone or ipod; if you can place your head right in front of it, you get an even better image. The only nits are a buzz when nothing is plugged in and the default volume when you plug it in is far too loud (you have to lower the volume after you turn it on every time).Update: had to edit this unfortunately. The sound dock no longer works properly w/ an iphone 2G w/ the 3.1 operating system...it won't charge in the dock and just overheats and the buttons become unresponsive (obviously some firmware issue w/ the speaker). If I plug a Motorola Cliq into the 3.5mm cable, the Cliq's touchscreen flakes out and thinks you're pressing different areas of the screen. I guess now we know why Mirage discontinued this :-P"
4,"Good stuff again Don, and John Danworth, you take a bow too. I thought I would have to review all of Grapes videos myself!",A very fine review of this by J.D.I can't add much more except tosay Grapes is one-of-a-kind. Keepup the good work guys in Canada!
3,Indifferent performance and sound for B minor Mass,"Mediocre overall. Performance, in my layman's opinion, is OK at best, and in the case of soprano, Lucia Popp, a bit less than that sometimes. The sound tends to be a bit vague and distant.Spend a little more and get a better a better version of this magnificant work."
4,Perfect for Beginners & Non-techies,"This book was definitely written for non-technical people. In order to enjoy this book, one does not have to have great knowledge in electronics and mathematics. As matter of fact, the author completely avoids using mathematical equations and replace it with very easy-to-follow graphs to explain the complex ""Radiophysics"". The author did a very good job of explaining difficult topics of ""Radiophysics"" using normal everyday language. An excellent starter book for anyone who is interested in learning how our modern communication works. I wish I had read this book before I started my college engineering courses. Concepts mentioned in this book can be a stepping stone for anyone(high school students, people in technical sales, non-technical managers, and even tax agents) who is considering a career in RF/wireless communication field. This book will definitely set you in the right path for an introductory communication class."
1,Don't waste your money,"Papers don't stay together very well. It was a cute idea, but doesn't work well. You have to handle the stapled papers carefully otherwise, they fall apart. Don't waste your money."
4,It work's.,"If you need something extra, this really worksHealth Plus - Super Colon Cleanse Day/Night System - 2 pc"
2,"Nice functionality, bad quality","I wore this watch maybe 5-6 times and the ring around the watch face is coming loose. I suppose for $99 you can't ask for a lot, but this is really shoddy."
2,classic Nancy Wilson,"I bought this album when it first came out in the early 60s and loved it. I haven't played it often in recent years because I didn't want to wear it out, so this was a welcome find. Still classic, still very good."
5,Wonderful female character,I like the interplay between the different genders. The female character is very strong and married to a powerful man who feels threatened by a strong woman. However there is another man in the story who appreciates what she brings to this earth.
5,Cyndi just wanna have fun! Time after time...,Her vocals are better than any other artist including Madonna (...) but she doesn't sing this one on the concert. I love Cyndi and she sounds and move better Live! A must have for a Music Lover and a Cyndi fan. She's over 50 and still Rocks!
5,Oh My God,"I bought this DVD because first off I am a huge Cyndi fan and would buy whatever she put out. I must admit I didnt have high hopes on this being a high quality production but I was wrong! The picture & sound quality is perfect! Cyndi is in amazing voice as always and her performance of If You Go Away brought tears to my eyes. For the music, for the price, for the memories, buy this DVD. It is a must have! You will be glad you did. If you havent seen Cyndi live in the past 14 years, you need to see this. Yeah, she is the one who sang Girls Just Want To Have Fun (which she sings here) but she has grown up in every way, most importantly her voice. There is a true artist here and now maybe the world can see it.And hey Cyndi, when are you gonna bring this new tour to the South East? It's been 3 years and we are waiting for you!(...)"
2,Overrated,"Bought this item based on positive reviews on this site. However, found the scales vary from .2 up to 2.2 pounds depending on how often you climb onboard. It is difficult to step onto these scales in precisely the same manner everytime because of the bulky design. I wanted consistant accuracy and these scales didn't deliver. Sent them back after 3 days."
2,No long standing quality,"Like another reviewer, this phone did not have any range, gets static-y if you get more than twenty feet away, but was tolerable. The bad thing is that it worked fine for a year, then after that the answering machine went all wonky, and would cut off in the middle of a message, then the buttons began to fail. When we pushed in a button, it would go in deeper and deeper until we had to use a screwdriver to push it.Finally, the answering machine stopped working all together, it would take messages, but we couldn't press the button to play OR delete, so the machine is full of messages we can't even listen too.I think you have problems with every phone, but I don't want to buy a phone for $80 + every year, that's ridiculous!I can't even recommend anything, but I do say check out Uniden. Still, very frustrating because phones cost so much. Tread carefully and buy them for features you really plan on using."
4,Sunny Florida Is a Solid Tori Amos Performance,"Tori Amos is an aquired taste to say the least. Her performances are very solemn and intense. But if you are a big Tori Amos fan, as I am, you should not be disappointed by this DVD. The picture and sound quality are both quite good. My only frustration is that they blanked out the profanity in ""Professional Widow."" It really detracted from the performance of this song and was unnecessary."
2,This DVD makes this RAINY instead of SUNNY!,"I reluctantly purchased this album because I figured I would give Tori Amos ONE last chance.Guess what? I've HAD it with her music. I totally give up.First impression: The woman is boring in concert and the music is just blah. Her lyrics are so absurd and irksome -- I laughed at some reviews whent hey said that the ""explosive"" version of Crucify was the best -- guess what?! they're wrong. It's drudging and has no life to it, just like many of the other songs on this particular DVD.Yeah, there's some nice songs from Scarlet's Walk and it was nice to see Matt Chamberlain painfully drum out her music -- little 6 song CD is the only reason I give this work 2 stars.Granted, Tori is somewhat talented in my opinion, but stop releasing albums - especially live ones.2 stars. Only for the true Tori fan!"
2,Disappointing,"Tori's performance is very good, HOWEVER the video and sound quality are awful. The camera work looks like it's a work of amateurs. This really damages the overall experience and that's a shame. Only for hardcore Tori fans."
2,Cradle,It is very heavy to handle due to the material it's made out of. Other books for green thinking are far better. This is a lesson in repetition.
3,Great read!,"This was a great introduction to so many key, elementary principles in sustainable thinking/living/product design. I learned a lot! I hope enough people are informed and inspired by it to create the kind of real change that is being discussed in this book in terms of truly ecological product designs in everyday things (e.g., cars, homes, and other ""products"" that incorporate biomimicry, etc)."
4,even the pages are a new paradigm,"This book is great I think everyone needs to read it and learn to think about the world and everything they encounter just a little differently. Where does it come from, where does it go. There is no 'Away' in the world and this book helps to make you realize that just a little more."
3,Knife came dirty and previously used,"Pros: Bone handleCons: Item came used. There was dirt in the knife.Thought I wanted a small knife. After purchasing, I realize this knife is too small.The locking mechanism gets dirty quickly and the blade will not lock all the way when this happens. This makes the knife unsafe/unusable until it's cleaned.Conclusion: Knife looks cool. Too small to be of much use to me, I lose it more than I use it. Locking mechanism gets jammed easily. Knife came dirty but I was too lazy to return it. Case knives are never sharp. The ""gentleman's"" knife I guess..."
4,****,Pretty helpful!it was my top pick of all the books i could find at Barnes & Noble one night.I'd recommend it to any bride.
3,Not much more than what you can get on their site,"This is a handy check list, but it isn't much more than what you can get off their website. I was hoping for a better planning tool - place to keep ideas, etc, but it is more of a check list of what you should do rather than an open planning format."
4,Helpful and well-organized,"I've browsed through many wedding planners at the bookstore and found that this was one to consider. Not only does it help you step by step through the necessary task in planning a wedding but it also shares real wedding experiences. The numerous worksheets are great. But despite all this- I am returning it. Many of the advice and Q&A can be found on their website. One of the main factors for me purchasing this book over the others was The Knot's reputation. It is handy to have everything easily accessibly in a printed book format. For me, however I wasn't quite happy with it. The fact that it wasn't spiralbound or hardbound really did serve as an inconvenience. But to others these factors may not be a problem."
2,Same info as their website for free,"The Knot also has the sad habit of condoning ""rituals"" that are and should continue to be socially unacceptable, such as family-hosted showers, money dances and Bridezilla behavior. Read Miss Manners or go to etiquettehell.com if you really want to know what to do - or not."
1,Unforgivably lame,"While this book *was* helpful to me as a reference, I could never, ever recommend this book to anyone, least of all beginners. It is horribly inaccurate - he even claims that the NULL macro may be used as the 'null' termination character - and then complains that many compilers don't properly allow that without giving errors! (NULL is only for the use of null pointers). There are numerous cases where his lack of understanding in certain areas could lead beginning programmers down very bad coding paths, causing buggy or insecure code.On the plus side, he covers linux-specific issues of programming C++ very well, especially the use of emacs and gdb. I have found it useful despite it's flaws, but would contend that it is only worth reading to someone already quite fluent in C, so s/he may avoid the pitfalls that this book just walks right through."
2,Very dissapointing,"I bought volume 4 of this series and for weeks it wouldn't leave my cd player. On a whim I bought volume 3 without listening to it first and regretted it. This cd is very emotionless and none of the tracks stand out. I would reccomend passing this one up and purchasing Volume 4 instead, it's a much better representation of this series. Or, for a sure hit, buy any volume in the ""Future Sounds of Jazz"" compilation (if you can find them) and you will not be dissapointed. This jazz/electronic compilation style can be incredible, they just didn't hit the mark with this particular cd."
3,Movie story from the early 1920's,"18. Bobbie in Movieland by Father Finn (read in 1937 or 1938) I read this book with avidity. On page 388 of The Guide to Catholic Literature 1888-1940 it is shown the book was published by Benziger in 1921 with a selling price of $1.25. The Guide says of the plot: ""The 8-year-old hero breaks into the movies, and is on the way to fame and fortune--and, incidentally, to school--when the story ends."" (Cath. World 114-698 Feb 1922) (America 25:622 Oct 15, 1921)"
2,Simple Mistakes Make A Hard Read,"This book is informative. I could not buy the book because it has an entire chapter on ""Xwindows."" There is no such thing as Xwindows. ""X Window"" is a graphical display system for Unix. One of the main points of certification is learning the correct name for things common in the industry. After seeing such a simple error blasted all over every page of that chapter I was forced to put the book down."
5,Solid performance,This puppy works as expected. I used it to extend the connection to my Sony soundbar and subwoofer.No lost signal or audio/video sync issues.
1,NOT WORTH IT,Bought them to help reduce arch pain and they are not sturdy enough to provide the support I was looking for. The Dr Scholl's I got from Walmart were actually better and they only reduce the pain by 50%.
5,Just what I needed,"I have been using Spenco arch supports for years. I buy high quality New Balance shoes for running and immediately replace the insoles with Spenco inserts. I have been running for over 40 years without knee, hip or ankle problems - and I had issues before I started using the Spenco inserts. Friends who do not use these inserts or equivalents have been forced to stop running."
1,"Eh, not what I thought I was buying","I bought a pair of insoles from these guys a while ago and I thought this was the same product. It wasn't, but based on the good reviews I figured, my father, with bad knees, could use the arch support to help relieve some pressure. Instead he back started hurting after a week of use. He gave them back to me, I tried them for a day and they didn't do me any good.I prefer the hard plastic insoles with arch support, which is what I got last time and still use today."
5,Good support and comfort,These insoles do the job well. They are comfortable. They provide good arch support. I've noticed that my heels hurt less now that my arches are supported. Seem durable. Satisfied customer.
5,Excellent Arch Support,"I've used Dr. Scholl's for many years for impact workouts, and the Spenco is definitely an upgrade for running and simply everyday walking. It has help with fatigue and soreness."
2,Identity theft - Amazon check yourself,"I have not written these reviews. Somehow, Amazon has allowed someone to get hold of my e-mail address and my personal information and therefore into my personal account. I have contacted them about this without success. I want to delete my account before further damage is done.The real Lynette Joseph-Brown"
4,Diferente,"Este cd es excelente aunque si estas acostumbrados a los cds de reggaeton agresivo como Los rompediskotecas que son pa bailar o mejor decir perrear no te va a gustar mucho . Al principio lo tuve que escuchar par de veces pa cogerle el feeling despues de ahi lo tengo al palo. En este cd Noriega canta en las mayoria de las canciones ademas de producir. La mayoria de las canciones son romanticas hablando de amor y desamor. Aunque hay una que otra que son como jocosas es decir de fiestas o cosas asi. Tienes a varios cantantes como a Tito el bambino, Voltio, Divino, Guanabanas, Baby Rasta, Angel y Krhiz, John Eric y La Sistel( la proxima exponente mujer que le veo futuro en el reggaeton). Canciones favoritas1. Las noches son tristes.2. Atangana.3. Hay de mi.4. A mi no me enganas5. A oscuras6. Tanto dolor."
4,Just another hip hop album,"I got this album for free when I walked into the movie theatre. Even before I saw ""Save the Last Dance"" I wanted to buy the soundtrack because the music for dance movies always tend to be good: for example, Dirty Dancing, Bring It On, Coyote Ugly, etc. This soundtrack, however, did not have much music with a good beat nor music that exemplified the story of the movie. The songs are pretty good individually; that's the reason this album gets four stars. Some personal favs would have to be ""Ballad of Firestar,"" ""You,"" ""Bonafide"" and ""Get it on Tonite."" Hope this was helpful to you."
4,Great to workout to!,I got this CD not expecting a whole lot. But it's turned out to be a great one to treadmill too. It's got enough variety that I don't have to skip over any songs. I recommend it.
5,Throw your hands up,"the title of the track that goes ""throw your hands up, if you got a fifty dollar bill throw your hands up"" is ""Be Faithful"" by Fatman Scoop feat The Crooklyn Clan. Trust Me."
2,It is not Q. Lazarus!,"The song ""Goodbye Horses"" was originally performed by Q. Lazarus. On this album it is performed by Psyche. Q. Lazarus did a better job. I was not happy with this CD. The search for Q. Lazarus continues!"
5,Happy boys. Happy mommy,Fun toy that uses imagination. Assembly was easy - we had some help from Christmas guests and it was fast and fun.
2,"Makes coffee, sometimes leaks","This coffee maker makes good coffee, is attractive sitting on the counter, and conveniently dispenses coffee. However, 1 1/2 years after purchase with daily use it now leaks coffee onto the countertop and will have to be replaced. I have replaced the washer inside, but that did not solve the problem. You may want to look elsewhere and spend your money wisely."
3,Great idea; Short Life,"Although we have enjoyed this coffee maker - the concept is great - the dispenser broke after 9 months. Even though it has a year warranty, Hamilton Beach will only offer a replacement part. So, if I want to wait 3 weeks and learn how to repair coffee makers, I can keep this one. I believe I'll just buy another from another manufacturer with hopefully, better customer service."
5,This is fantastic.,"This is much better then my first brewstation- it hasn't leaked, it seems to have a tighter seal. I have M.S.- Multiple Sclerosis, I can't use carafes, because I have a shaking hand. I don't have to worry with the pouring of coffee with this. And it matches my silver & black appliances."
1,Great Idea - Terrible Design,"I bought this coffeemaker based on all the great reviews I saw for it and thought it was a brilliant idea. Well, it still is a brilliant idea, but the design is terrible. There is a small plastic lever with a seal that is supposed to stop the water from leaking. The lever is not tight enough or spring loaded. The instructions state that the seal has to be flush to work properly. The seal is too thick and too small around to be flush with the bottom. I spent two hours trying to get this machine to not leak with no success. I am returning it and going back to Krups. I guess Hamilton Beach has the same quality it always has."
4,Why would you pay more?,In searching for a coffee maker for my daughter for her dorm we came across this one. My question is why would you order it from Amazon for $90+ when Walmart has it online for $54?
4,Money well spen,"I have had my BrewStation for about a month now and have really been pleased. It replaced a Bodum vacuum unit which went belly-up after several years of service.If anything on the unit could be improved, it would be the coffee dispensing mechanism. It seems a bit flimsy. I also have to hold the unit with my left hand when it is dispensing the last bit as it will move if I don't.I really like not having a carafe and the unit holds the coffee at temperature w/o scorching it. One thing I find interesting is that the BrewStation makes 20% more coffee with the same weight of beans/strength of brew as the Bodum did, 1,800ml vs 1,500ml. I would have thought the extraction of the vacuum pot more effective.For me the money I spent on this BrewStation was well spent."
5,Great Product,"We have had this coffeemaker for 15 months and love it! It makes great coffee and has a large variety of options for delayed start and keeping it warm after it is made, with automatic shutoff!"
4,GREAT COFFEE,"Love the Brew Station. Easy to use, easy to clean, makes great coffee, even if you only want a cup or two! Got it real fast too with Amazon, who always provides great service!"
1,Brewstation,This is our second Brewstation and it didn't last a full year. It seems to be leaking coffee onto the counter but we've been unable to figure out where it is coming from. For the price it should last longer then it did.
2,Requires a steady stream of replacment parts,We love this coffeemaker but it no longer makes sense financially to maintain it. After using it for about a year the tank began to leak. A new tank (free but we paid for shipping $8) fixed the problem. Now a year and a half later the new tank is leaking. Hamilton Beach sent some replacement rubber seals but they didn't fix the problem. The only solution is to buy a replacement tank at a cost of $25. This is a fairly pricey machine to begin with--I'm not paying $25 a year on top of that to keep it going.
1,BUYER BEWARE,"This has great features but unfortunately it has been more trouble than it is worth, we are on our second one now and it has just broken down.the first worked for a week and then would turn off every time you bumped it now after a couple of months on the second one will brew a cup and then shut off on its own, biggest piece of junk I ever wasted my money on!!!!!update 07/07/2010...now on the third pot sent from HB to replace the second one....today the button that allows coffee to come out broke...this is the cheapest piece of junk I have ever bought...SAVE YOUR MONEY get something else!!!!!! If I could give it zero stars I would"
1,it leaks,i have had this for about a year and the leak is so bad i can't use it anymore. the coffee reseroir leaks between the sides and bottom at the seam. i get coffee leaking all over the counter top. it made great coffee but seemed to need more frequent cleaning than other coffeemakers i have used.
1,"Ditto, it leaks",Everything said about the leaking problem is true. I wish I had checked out the reviews at Amazon before buying this thing.
2,"Once again, I am disappointed.","We had the first brewstation and we were ok with it except we had bought the one you couldn't program and you couldn't tell how much coffee was left. This one can be programmed. In that respect, it is fine. You can also set it to stay on for four hours instead of the two hour auto shutoff. The coffee is great too. Now, the downsides. First, once again, you can't see how much coffee is left. It's almost impossible. Then, after only two months, the thing leaks! We clean it regularly so that isn't the problem. I will attempt to send it back and see how I make out. I hope to update this when and if I receive a solution."
4,Wrong height listed in product features,"I love this type of coffeemaker which has no carafe. I've only had this one for a day but I perfer it's features over the Hamilton Beach I am replacing. I have low hanging cabinets so one of the reasons I bought this particular model is the listed height of 14 1/2 inches. It's 15 inches so I cannot slide it under my cabinets, very disapointing! I'll live with it because I really like the machine.FYI: Amazon also sells the model I am replacing which is 47665. The height on it is listed as 17 inches but it's 14 1/2 and slides under my cabinets."
2,Lasted for only 1 year!,"I loved this Brewstation Deluxe and used it daily for about a year with great results, but then it started leaking coffee out of the bottom. I wasn't able to find the source of the leak. Then, it quit brewing a full cycle. I'd fill it to make a full pot, and it would shut off and stop brewing after brewing only 2 cups. And on top of those problems, the clock stopped working! I gave up on it and threw it in the garbage."
1,JUNK,"Bought two of these, as we have have a cottage ande I liked the idea of on glass coffee pot. The home one started to pour slow, so I re cleaned it and removed the waher in the poyt clean,. Washer would not go back on pot, spring flipped out no clue where it is and from looking at my other pot some star shaped piece broke off. SO I brought my plastic pot from my second on back, thought all was solved, worked great dispensing cold water. So I made a pot of coffee and will not dispense hot coffee. For the price, this is a piece of junk I wanted to rate zero but your site will not let me I have had $10.00 coffee makers last longer."
2,Didn't last very long before problems started,"We purchased the BrewStation Deluxe about a year/year and a half ago and it slowly began to dispense the coffee slower and slower so that now we need to pour it from the top section as the coffee merely trickles from the press-on dispenser. We are very disappointed with our purchase and expect a coffee maker to last more than a year.We have tried cleaning the unit using vinegar, elbow grease and just about every other way we can think of, but there is no difference in the speed with which the coffee trickles out."
3,"Great hands free coffee pot, but....","I love this coffee maker. It isn't the fastest brewer but it makes great coffee and it is so nice to be able to press your cup, whatever height, against the switch and fill up. Pouring always leads to spills and the glass carafes get broken. There is only one drawback - the seal on the upper chamber can start to leak and there is no source I could find to get a replacement seal. My first one lasted 3 years and I bought this one willing to take the chance again."
5,Wanting to return,"A few years back a friend loaned me a copy of this book. At first I was dubious that I'd find much enjoyment in it, but after a few turns of the pages I was hooked. Since then the story has haunted me. Now I wish to return to its pages, reacquaint myself with its landscape, language, and characters. I searched for this title on Amazon because I intend to buy a copy and read it again. After that I intend to loan it to a few friends of mine. Maybe they will become believers too. Try it. See."
3,NOT ARMY AUTHORIZED,"Very nice ACU shirt/pants but not ""Army Authorized""The color is quite a bit brighter than Army-Issued so you definitely standout in formation.Great for fishing or hunting :)"
4,Solid,"Great book,Not as entertaining as Kitchen Confidential, but this is still a good book for those who enjoy the show No Reservations."
1,I could have bought a good piece of steak.....,"for the money I wasted on this.I liked Kitchen Conf. This however is;Self-congratulating, bigoted, hypocritical, sexist, and (at times) xenophobic.I really did not like this one! (You can tell can't you)?"
1,disappointment,"the book was being sold as good condition, but it had writing with a marker all over it, someone crossed out part of the title and wrote in inappropriate words on the book.... im very disappointed with how they can expect some one to keep a book like that."
3,"Ilium was superb, Olympus fell short, but was still superb","I don't need to repeat what everyone else has said. Both Ilium and Olympus were great. But there was too much in Olympus unanswered, I didn't finish the book with a sense of wonder, but rather with a sense of frustration and disappointment.Frankly, it was TOO vague. Don't worry, I won't spoil the book. But there was just too much that was simply introduced with no explanation, then taken away. Moira, Sycorax, The Quiet... the list goes on. I have NO idea where these things came from, what they were doing, and just what happened. I think Simmons overstretched with Olympos."
1,Beyond Bad,"This book was really frustrating, boring, and just not up to par with Dan Simmons others books and series. By the end I was really frustrated that I had waded through 2 long books for nothing. Many of the 'mysteries' were never explained, way too many chapters were devoted to laborious details and inane poetry or quotes, and the story never really comes together. In addition, he repeated himself over and over, using the FULL long names of people and places every time. Perhaps if the books had been half as long and more succinct, they would have been tolerable. Dan Simmons' other books, especially the Hyperion series are simply awe inspiring SCI fi; The Rise of Endymion being one of the best books of this type ever. Not sure what he was thinking with this stuff, but I sure hope he doesn't keep going on this downhill spiral."
1,don't read,"I advise anyone just to read the first part of this series Ilium, but don't read Olympos. I don't know how anyone could give a positive review of this book. The writing, the story, the mystery, the reason, the characters, it all falls appart in the sequel. Read the first book, imagine your own ending to the story. I assure you it's better then the second book."
5,Fantastic,"Dan Simmons has an imagination rivaled by no other. It was incredible the situations the main characters would find themselves in and it was very absorbing to see how things turned out. This is Simmons at his best. Very literary Science Fiction which may not be enjoyed by more ""light"" readers."
3,Stop Reading w/ 75 pgs Left For a 5 Star Book,"I'll try to keep it short for the passing reader:Really, really, really good book the first 90% of it. But then you are presented with a limp finale and than a follow-up that could have done with some better chapter organization (Switching the last 2 chapters may have provided a better effect, asinine I know but I'm just trying to find some potential).It really felt like all the storylines just fall apart at the end into weak explanations (or more then likely no explanation at all). I enjoyed reading about the science in Ilium and moreso in Olympos but Simmons just doesn't string it together well enough. All of a sudden one of the characters just ""figures it all out"".If you insist on buying this book (which you should if you have already read Ilium), I would suggest halting after part 3 ends, maybe you won't have too bitter a taste in your mouth like I was left with after proceeding though Part 4."
3,"Slow at times, complex, carefully thought out","Like its predecessor, Ilium, Olympos starts kind of slow, and has its slow spots. Still, it's a worthy sequel, and addresses some of the open topics left dangling after Ilium. Simmons is a master of believable alternate realities and complex, credible intertwining storytelling. We learn more of the war against the gods, the Little Green Men are explained, and we see the post-literate society grapple with re-learning fundamental survival skills. Recommended."
3,It's OK - Rainy Day Read,"Just finished this first book in Buckley's series. I liked the time period and the character of Ursula. But, the writing is very basic and the plot lines and dialogue became very redundant. Maybe it's my fault, but I just couldn't keep track of the group of characters that were suspects - who they were and how they related to the victim.To sum up, there just wasn't 326 pages worth of content. The 2 and 3 star ratings for the other books in the series really ring true. I probably won't be continuing with the series."
1,I am Returning this phone today!,"Buyer Beware...read reviews and search the web for info before you purchase. Great features, but not worth it if the volume is weak, tinny sound and uncomfortable bump design against ear.Battery does not last long either. Hopefully motorola will redesign after receiving enough returned phones and bad reviews."
2,Had to Return This,"We spent a few weeks researching options we wanted for our new telephone system by reading manuals in the product boxes. We purchased this Motorola system as it seemed to have what we wanted. But, after 28 days of 'forcing ourselves' to use it, we returned it to Target.I wish I could give it a higher rating because it has sooooo many positive features BUT the reception was horrible!!! 95% of our using it was done inside our house. When talking on the phone the incoming voice would fade in and out (no matter what we tried to change it) or the connection would be crackling. When we would listen to recorded messages they were the same or extremely garbled. We had other family members and friends try it while visiting and they had the same experience.We purchased the AT-T E2600B Cordless Answering Machine System with 2 cordless handsets, each having speakerphones in handsets and base. Now I'm off to write a 5 star review on the AT-T (of course we purchased this at Target!!!)."
3,"Great features, one problem - dead buttons in 10 months",This is very good phone system setup and has many great features that you may not find in even more expensive sets. I loved everything & especially shared phone book where you need to enter your commonly dialed numbers only once and access them from any headset. The one and only problem: 2 out of 3 handset's buttons are dying which renders it useless. I did call Motorola and they informed me that they know of this problem & will replace all faulty handsets with improved ones. Will see what will happen. If it is true - I recommend this phone system.
1,Mistake to purchase this,"I had to purchase a new set of cordless phones since my others were dying on me after a few years. I picked this up at a BJ's, as I liked the features and the form factor. Big mistake. First, the battery life is awful. But worse, there are times that in the middle of the call the phone just resets. I was on an important conference call for work and the battery died with about 10 seconds warning. The speakerphone is not loud, and sometimes I have trouble hearing when there is any background noise at all. STAY AWAY from this product. I wish I had read the reviews first..."
1,Don't do it.,"Had this for 3 yrs., replaced all batteries, 1 hand set is dead and hardly any buttons work. Hope I don't need to call 911 the 1 button is not working. I will never buy a Motorola again. Look at something else."
1,expensive mistake,"I had a mid grade uniden expandable handset before this one but I decided to upgrade. I liked the look of the phone but any positive feelings were gone by the time I set them up. the phonebook is rediculous. on the uniden i could punch in the first letter and get a short list. with this motorola, I've got to scroll through the entire phone book. Another thing is the power fades in just a few hours so I'm constantly having to run for the other phone. One of the handsets has the fading in and out thing as well as the tin can effect. The most annoying part is that - after 6 months-I had to push the 6 button really hard to get it to enter and then the 3 and 9 followed. Now, none of them work! I'd give anything to have my uniden back!!!"
1,Amazon won't ship,"I've had this book on order for over 6 months, and Amazon keeps shifting the delivery date. Don't bother ordering it."
1,Programmers forgot some major details,"Love to play the game, with the same exceptions noted by others (the dialog gets old very very quickly and no you cannot shut it off - jeez)The biggest problem I have with this game is that running under windows 2000, even though I followed all of the advice in the tech support site, I cannot load my saved decks after I log off and log back on.I cannot justify playing a game that is so difficult to build a deck when you cannot successfully save and retrieve the deck. This problem makes the fun game into a pile of junk."
3,Could have been better,"This volume completes the Paradise X series and I was disappointed in the finished product. A number of story lines were left incomplete; in fact, the book had a very rushed and hurried feel to it. It was if Krueger and Ross ran out of steam to finish the tale and simply threw something together to make the deadline.While not in the league of The Watchmen or the Sandman series, it is an acceptable diversion for a lazy Sunday afternoon."
5,Great Quality For A Great Price,"I may have previously broke my last one by neglect, but it was a better quality than the one the company I worked for offered. And they were going to charge me about 3x the price. Great buy for a Great Quality Item."
2,oxygen regulater,This item was advertised with a 2 1/2 lpm setting. The setting goes from 2 to 3 on up to 15 lpm.This should be corrected
2,I mean...,"The clip was cute, but what's the point of having such a tiny clip of a movie? I didn't get it."
5,Great Buy Would recommend,I will be using this box to propose to my girl friend this weekend.. Much smaller than I thought but perfect size to fit in my pocket and makes the ring look bigger ;)
2,Black Leather Ring Boxes,"We have been using these boxes for a few days, one is holding up fine, but the other is already difficult to close and feels as if it is going to break."
1,NOT A QUALITY PHONE,"I purchased this phone last year and so did an aunt of mine. I really like the fact that the phone announces the caller, and that is the ONLY reason I have not tossed the phone. People complain they can't always hear me...even worse when i use voice enhance button...I have a very old sony that has 10 times the clarity of this phone and I use that as my main phone. Forget talking if the microwave is on! I also have trouble with clarity if I use it near the computer. My aunt has all the same gripes about her phone and when we call each other the quality is super bad...I didn't even know she had the same phone until some time later! I'll let you know the next phone I get, probably a sony...p.s. I paid 128.00 at Costco."
5,Quite a well done guide,"Well, Prima's known for good strategy guides, and they deliver quite nicely here. There are complete items charts with where to get them, where to use them, and a brief description of them. There are detailed enemy bios as well as weapon stats. The guide is very thorough in the walkthrough and even covers the battle game in great detail. If it wasn't for this guide, I would never have found the submachine guns and some of the other more well hidden items. A great buy and well worth the price."
2,Phosoplex,"For me the jury is still out on this product. I bought the 120 capsule bottle initially. My problem is with the vendor Total Body Solutions, aka Body Solutions, aka Bodestore. I reordered (360 capsules) after 25 days, 10 days later my order had not shown up. I contacted them and was told that my credit card did not go through. They never bothered to let me know. I reordered using the exact same credit card info, which had been saved on my computer. The order went through the second time. I contacted them and asked them to kindly pick up the $3.00 fee to send the order Priority Mail to make up for their mistakes. They refused. I recommend that you buy this product elsewhere. These people could care less about their customers."
2,Rock and Roll at 50,Added Applause Ruin It ! Ridiculous ! Rock and Roll at 50 ..... Forget it ! It's not worth the time or money !
5,Just finished my 3rd read and still couldn't put it down!,"I just finished my 3rd read and I just can't get enough of his stories of a wild and beautiful country and the tough, hardy people who live and work there. I laughed most of my way through it. Some of the stories are hilarious! Some are sad but life in the Alaskan wild can definitely be brutal at times. I guess knowing the pilot helps! You won't regret this purchase!"
3,Review :Collage frame,The first frame we recieved was scratched beyond use. The second one needed to have two panels reglued because one fell off and the other was about to....nice.
3,"Nice frame, but YMMV big time","I got this frame from a local store two years ago. While it is very nice and I am looking to buy a couple more, I would not buy it online - out of seven or eight sets they had at the store when I bought it, all had many scratches and one was broken. I picked out one with the least noticeable couple scratches and I am pretty happy with it."
2,10 Picture Collage Frame-Clear,"The item is not worth the money, although it is nice it is cheaply made, you have to be very careful hanging it up on the wall. The frames overlap eachother. I would not buy another one."
5,Exquisitely and Constructively Entertaining for our kids!!,"We were totally new to It's Hip Hop Baby, we discovered it through an interview with Gayle King on [...].We originally purchased the brand new ""Dance Class"" DVD that was released on [...] in May this year (2010) and our kids, Michelle and Tommy loved it. We played the dvd during weekends over and over! We were looking for another dvd for Michelle, and we found ""All Your Child's Favourites"" on amazon. I must say this is top class production and direction by Candi Carter, exquisite entertainment and absolutely constructive. Michelle is learning numbers and letters and laughs so much!! Absolutely awesome, won't be dissapointed!!"
4,The St. Valentines Day Massacre,A very well written and produced movie.Why don't they make them like this anymore? Thoughtful direction.Good performances from an excellent cast. It maintains your interest throughout.
3,Not on par with King's other books,"This book took a while to get into. It seemed strained and forced. It was a chore to read the first half of the book, but it wasn't necessarily a bad read."
1,Terrible,"Seems to be written by a 13 year old for 10 year olds. No plot, or characher development. I highly suggest you do not waste your time or money."
5,The Eyes of the Dragon,"As we are all aware, Stephen King is one of the most influential and brilliant writers of our time. I don't think I actually realized why until I picked up this book.I've always stuck to more of his horror stuff, I was always very wary of his ""storyish"" books. I decided I might as well give this book a chance and began reading it. I ended up reading well into the night until I had finished the book.This book is wonderful. Naturally, it has that fairytale element, but without all of the corny tidbits that become annoying. No, this book included all the grim and dismal details. It made this book seem all the more real. Of course, there were happy aspects of the book, and you were able to learn to love the characters.Complete with evil sorcerer, brave prince, and fierce dragon, this was the perfect fantasy story."
4,Great,"I enjoyed this book a lot, but it didn't really quench my thirst for a typical book by Stephen King. It would be wonderful for someone who enjoys fantasy, by I don't think that is was the right book for me, a lover of horror, especially vampires. You may love it. I loved the illustrations and descriptions."
4,My review of EotD,"Excellent book. Fantasy that isn't too over the top ,told by one of the greatest story tellers around.Loved every minute of it."
3,For New King Readers,King as usual does not leave us disappointed but for the die-hard King fan the characters and plot is not as expanded as others. A disappointment for me but still a darn good book.
1,it should burn,I hope this book goes out of print soon so others will not have to suffer threw all 300 pages of this horse pucky book.
5,Wonderful!,"I was looking for a book to read, and came across the 1987 printing of this novel in the family study. Not joking, it was dusty, and old, and the pages were very torn, making it look very fantasy-like. I read it, and I loved it at once! The plot, the characters. All the time I felt I was there in Delain and watching everything unfold before my eyes. Today the book not only bears my three sisters' names on the front page, who read it long before I did, but my name as well. Now I keep it by my bedside and pick it up whenever I'm bored or before I sleep! One read is never enough!"
4,I love this story!,"WOW!! I love this book. The story is a fantasy and King weaves a nice tale about good reigning over evil in the end. As in true King form the text is flowing and grips you from the beginning. There is a king, a queen, the princes, the king's advisor, dragons, battle, and one magnificent dollhouse! All is well until the king dies mysteriously and his son is accused of the murder. What will happen next? Will the prince escape his wrongful conviction? Read on, friends! Definitely one of my favorite King novels.."
5,Randall Flaag by any other name...,"Eyes of the Dragon, in my personal opinion is a sort of 'prequel'to The Dark Tower series. We get a first-hand layout of Delain(which is where I beleive Roland hails from) and some names that are familiar in the D.T. series that were present in the E.o.D. book. The kingdom of Delain may be the ""good-old"" days that Roland so fondly speaks of, and I beleive that I had more of an insight to the characters that were mentioned because I read the Eyes of the Dragon before I started on the D.T. series.Any-who, the book is great, as they all are."
1,New Flash,"To all my fellow FS pilots: News Alert!This product does NOT contain ""over 85 aircraft"" as the marketing garbage on the box screams. It contains FOUR aircraft in 85 paint schemes, which is a different thing altogether.I don't own this product yet, and now that I've discovered the truth about it by researching it online, I don't plan to. Instead, I highly recommend the stellar ""Wings of Power"" from Tri Synergy, and shame on Abacus for allowing such a blatantly fraudulent marketing ploy. Their marketing department should all be ridden out of the building on a rail, but not before they are tarred and feathered. Morons.The sad part is that it might be a perfectly good piece of software; but lying is always a VERY bad way to start with me, and so they won't be getting my money. I suggest a boycott."
3,"so, so","I probably would not have continued reading the book but I heard the author on C-span and enjoyed her comments and it made me continue to read. I do not usually read non fiction so was not familiar with a lot of the books she read. If you are a non-fiction reader, you would probably really enjoy the book."
3,Mediocre,"Nelson's essays are neither witty nor insightful enough to be very enjoyable. I found them mediocre at best, a slick marketing effort at worst. And frankly, the author comes across as rather whiny and self-indulgent. Can't recommend."
2,How can such a devoted reader have so little feel for language?,"The thing that best sums up this book for me is the fact that the word proscribed is misused not once, but twice. Once Nelson uses it to mean circumscribed and once to mean prescribed. How should I trust her literary discernment (which was apparently formulated on Harold Robbins novels) when her verbal discernment is so slight?Many have written here about the inherent snobbery of the book, so I won't belabor the point except to mention that anyone who describes him/herself as ""well-bred"" isn't. Instead I shall simply say that Nelson definitely knows the world of books--especially contemporary books--far better than I do, but her understanding of literature feels incredibly partial and immature."
2,Self-Indulgent,"How could someone who reads so much be so shallow? Well, she reads but, judging from what she says in this book, not at a very high level. This is an empty book about an empty person. Sara badly needed one of her friends to tell her the truth before she embarrassed herself like this."
2,A real waste of time,"I hate to offend an author but this was terrible. I consider myself a readaholic and thought this was my type of book. I was very disappointed. Most of the book is about herself and comes off as egotisical. Twice she mentions that she selects one book to take on vacation, then doesn't read it for one reason or other, and is left to search for another book to read. A true book lover knows you should take between three and five books on a trip! About page 59, she mentions that she has a rule that she allows herself to stop reading a book around page 50 if it does not hold her interest. That was the best advice she gave, and I took her up on it and ditched this book. Don't bother with this one."
5,Perfect tool for the job,"I purchased this recorder for my mother, she is having severe medical problems and this recorder works perfectly to capture what her Doctors are saying so she can listen to it as many times as needed to fully understand what was said without having to rely on others to explain it to her and possibly loose something in translation.I give this item a 5 due to the amount it holds, ease of use and last but definately not least it's size, it's small enough to fit in a pocket or her purse but not to small that a full size thumb can easily operate the control buttons without worrying about hitting more than one at a time."
2,"Ok hardware, software is lacking severely.","The Olympus 4100PC is a decent piece of audio recording hardware. It can record about two days worth of audio. The software is not extremely useful or helpful. There is no reason a USB device shouldn't support a non-proprietary interface to offload your audio files.Pros: Voice quality is decent; long recording times;Cons: Software is limited; If you loose your CD, throw away the device;"
4,Olympus VN4100PC Digital Recorder Order Review,I experience the same problem of receiving the VN4100 rather than the VN4100PC. I contacted tha Amorada Camera about this and they sent me a prepaid mailing label to return recorder. I was also refunded all my cost back to my credit card. I reorder the VN4100PC from Amazon (the cost was $10 higher but it included the shipping cost) and received it in the time limit Amazon specified. Except for the hassle of returning the VN4100 I am satified with the product and service.
2,you will get the wrong item,"You will order the 4100PC, but you will get the 4100. I thought Tiger did this, so I tried J&R and they did it too. Then you have to send it back, get them to offer you a higher price for the 4100PC and in the end, you pay as much for the 4100PC as you would have from Best Buy or Circuit City. The price is no deal. The page is wrong and Amazon says its the responsibility of the seller to fix it. So they just sit and wash their hands of the whole thing and don't really care that its wrong."
3,No Conversion to Audio CD,"Surprisingly small, light and inexpensive. I purchased the Olympus VN-4100PC to record interviews which I intended to transfer to audio CD. I was disappointed to learn (a bit too late) that neither the software shipped with this unit nor any of the media programs on my computer will convert the peculiar recording format (CELP+ADPCM) to an audio CD. Other than that major disappointment, it works well."
3,the quality of the recorded sound is not good,"the quality of the recorded sound is not good compared to old cassette recorder if you want to record, say, the piano songs your kid is playing"
4,Is this price accurate?,"I just purchased this at a well known office supply store. Once I got used to the different folders it was great. I'm still trying to move or delete sections within files once I move recordings to my pc.I really like it so far...This review probably won't make it past proofreading but you all should know that I purchased this NEW, with pouch, software to move recordings to pc and the cable to do so - total REGULAR store price was $49.99. NO, I didn't forget the hundred in front). I came on line for accessories.Sorry Amazon, I don't know who's wrong - most of the time you're better with the price. No mistake - looking at recorder and receipt dated 13 days ago.Sharon - Bucks County, PA"
4,Nice unit but a bit tinny sound.,"I bought to use at fiddle camp. Very easy to use to record tunes. I could gte out of my pocket and recording without missing the beginning. Playback is a bit tinny, but what I expected from small unit like this. I had tried to use my wife's Sony last year but found it much more complicated to use. This one was easy."
1,Stopped working after 4 months...,So perhaps I was just unlucky but this thing worked great until it completely crapped out and I lost some very important notes I had left on it. I have to be honest but I have not had very much luck with Olympus products in general. I am now using a Sony voice recorder which is still working after 6 months. I have to agree with some other reviewers that the software is pretty slow and can be cumbersome...sometimes it doesn't recognize the device and you have to keep trying until the computer does recognize it.
5,"Great seller, great product",great seller.great product.records very well in normal settings...however the software that came with the device is somewhat ancient and difficult to use.
1,Not Computer Friendly,DO NOT buy this if you ever intend to move files to your computer. I switched to a Mac and it doesn't work with my computer. I tried it on 2 PC's and it doesn't recognize it. It does not come with software.
5,An Excellent Overview,"Like all travel books, the material is a bit dated, but out of the many imprints, I'm an unabashed & loyal Lonely Planet fan. There's lots of great history and culture, and although far from perfect, you'll do a lot worse with other imprints in my experience. Very helpful on a recent trip - far from perfect, but overall extremely good for a very dynamic and ever-changing city. Plus a personal hint to travelers - buying used copies is often better since the previous owner(s) will correct, add, or cross out information that makes it even more helpful. A decent book about a lovely place - recommended!"
2,Lil' Wayne again Fails to Comepete,"I had Bought Lil' Wayne's debut ""Tha Block is Hot"" and the album waz a waste of money to me with only 4 good songs outta 17 trax... Wayne again fails with his 19 track new album with only 2 good songs being ""Get off tha corner"" and ""Everything""... Wayne needs to think about wat Juvenile did.. He failed on ""Tha G-Code"" and i listened to his new album ""project English"" and it sucked horribly.. not one good song, so Juvi got tired after to failures in a row with cash money and never released project english and has left cash money.. the cash money bling bling era is old and the beets r all tha same and TURK is the only talent left in the label that will get bigg in the future....."
4,$$$WAYNE'S TIME TO SHINE$$$,"""Lights Out"" the second album from uptown rapper Lil Wayne hits stores everywhere. This album is a major improvement since his first. The lyrics are tight and the beats comming from the millionaires are always crazy along with the amazing production of Mannie Freash. There's 19 hot tracks featuring the Hot Boys and the Big Tymers. All the talk about Cash Money breaking apart doesn't have any effect on Wayne or his album. The best songs on the album are:""Get off The Corner"" ""On The Grind"" ""Break Me Off"" ""Shine"" and ""Jump Jiggy""The rest of the songs are still ok. This is one of the best Cash Money albums to date. Lil Wayne has amazing flow. This is a solid 4 star album. Check it out. Cash Money Can't be stopped"
1,Heart Rate Monitor,"Unless it is possible to have a heart rate of 200+ while jogging I think the heart rate monitor is very inaccurate. Also the timer only goes to 1hr and 40 min for some reason, so if you want to use it for long distance running I would buy another watch."
5,Synthetic reed for bass clarinet.,"I'm giving this reed a high rating because I think it does what it's supposed to do. Although it's made of synthetic material, it acts like a reed and gives a full sound. The advantage is that you can buy one of these and know what you are getting, while natural reeds are so variable in quality that you might have to buy a boxful to get two that you like. Whether you like the tone quality of the synthetic reed is more of a personal decision. I'm used to playing a B flat clarinet, so the bass clarinet sound is new to me. Still, it seems that the synthetic reed sound is a louder, more blaring sound than a natural reed. It sounds almost like a saxophone. The vibration it makes is very powerful. I am considering this reed a good, reliable one to have around, while I'm still on the lookout for a good natural one. It will always be there."
3,"Not Bad, If You've Got Huge Ears","Great stereo earphones, but they don't fit comfortably into my ears. They'd be great, if I had giant ear-holes."
4,A little too much detail.,This book explains a little too much background on the people and not enough detail about the imprisonment. But it does explain about what happen and how and why.
4,Extremely useful shelf-reference for fund-raisers,"Not only does this book offer real-life examples of letters for every conceivable fund-raising campaign and situation, it explains the structure of successful fund-raising letters. I refer to it frequently. 5 stars I reserve for anything written by Mal Warwick, who is in a class by himself. But 4 stars means I found Mr. Kuniholm's book well worth the money, repeatedly useful, practical, educational and wise."
4,Surprising...,"I must say, I am very, very surprised. I hate Alesana's old albums, but...On Frail Wings is pretty much awesome. Tilting the Hourglass is by far the best song on the album. It's pulled off very, very nicely. Ambrosia is also quite amazing.Really, though, who'd have thought such an emo band could make such a wonderful record? I really like it. 4.5/5."
3,Does its job but could be better,I put together my firewood rack using the plastic brackets and it's a moderate success. The problem is that the vertical 2x4's get wobbly - seems like they need another bracket about a foot up to give more support.
2,Frustrating- Disappointing,"Any of Michelle Reid's books are in my keeper shelf. She is very prolific and her style of writing pulls heart strings. There is so much passion and punches in her books. My favorite is The Mistress Bride.In Slave to Love, I really hated Mac, the Alpha Male. He had no deep love for his ""Bunny"" until she threatened to leave him then all of a sudden realized how he loved her. All this after threatening her, abusing her, using her just for his needs with no respect to her feelings. She was always ""second"" in his affections, and their were several scenes where he treated her like his blow up doll. The sad part was she took it all and would forgive him just with a kiss. It was a rushed ending and not a happy feel good one."
2,Weak transmission,"Like a lot of other people ours died after less then a year. We got a new one under warranty, which they were very good with. This one lasted about the same amount of time. I thought it did a pretty good job of keeping the box clean but eventually the rake would clog and the motor would stall. It is supposed to stop if encounters a clog, but occasionally we would find it slipping the pulleys against a clogged rake. Eventually both of them suffered a failure of a gear in the ""transmission"".I don't think this is the worst machine in the world and maybe if you pay enough attention to it, it will last longer. But ours needed to be taken apart too much, the bags and liners are an added cost and for the price it is not worth it. I will not buy any rake style automatic box again."
3,Nice,"This is am amateurish book that has a variety of good qualities to it. Most notable actually are the illustrations by Janet Aulisio (of FASA/Shadowrun fame), which make it worth picking up. One can empathize well with planeteer Boris Brazil, though one also becomes tired of the variety of `natives' on the planet. This novel is, principally, about conflict in a lack of resources."
5,You want action and laughter? You have it all here.,This box set holds some of the most vital scenes from the whole of the Alabasta arc of One Piece. It is a must see for any fan of the manga. Full of actions and laughs and some great scenes between characters.
2,You get what you pay for,"The quality of these batting gloves is unclear from the description given. They are low-quality. Fit for a little-leaguer or adult beginner, but that's about it. It's worth the extra 10 or 20 bucks to upgrade. Do not buy these gloves if you are an experienced player."
3,enema bottle,"this is my 3rd. bottle from cara , because the first two were well made and the price was right...this one seems to be of less quality than the others. i am making do with it (no pun intened) but i am not happy with it. when this one wears out i will try once more to see if maybe they have gotten better and if not , i will just get a store bought- john"
1,Not like the original brewstation,"Unlike the original brew station, this particular model comes with a new ""seal"" to prevent leaks. Despite following the directions explicitly to ensure that there would be no leakage, including a leak test, which I performed, this model, when left unattended, leaked the entire pot of coffee all over my counter top. Not impressed. Called customer service, who had me do exactly the same directions, which again involved leaking entire pot all over (this time I got smart... it was just hot water). finally gave up and returned it!"
5,Camille Claudel: A Novel--and What a Novel It Is!,"Camille Claudel, for those of us previously unexposed to her, was a real person, partner and lover to Rodin, and sculptor in her own right. And she is downright fascinating, from her obsession with sculpting to her passion with Rodin, to her descent into paranoia and madness, and finally to her thirty-plus years in an insane asylum.This book is fantastic! It is written from Camille's point of view as the author imagined her to be, based on historical records. Camille is sympathetic, outrageous, manipulative, charming, and downright scary at times. Since reading this book, I've looked up her marvelous sculptures, checked out a movie about her, and read more.So if you've been looking for a new book and aren't willing to settle for a sugar-coated romance, you need to read this book. The author is careful to stick to facts when they are known but isn't afraid to give Camille thoughts and a personality.Ann M. BeardsleyScribesworld Reviews [...]"
4,Excellent,"I purchased this book used, it was recieved in a timely fashion and its in great condition. There is no writing or torn pages."
3,"An easy read, but a bit out of date","I had to read this for a class and found it easy to read, but really out of date. Although revised in December of 2001, there is so much it left out in terms of changes in technology and 9/11 that I wonder how thoroughly it was updated.If you're buying it, most probably you have to. Ask your professor to find a more current edition, but one that's as interesting and easy a read as this one, and you'll do fine in your class!"
4,Useful employment law textbook,This is a very useful employment law textbook. This book is a valuable read for many students as well as those who wish to learn more about labor law and human resources law. If you are an expert in the field you might not find this book to be as useful.
3,"Great book, but...","This is one of the best books about how to run an IT department, and it's so useful and straight-forward that I'd recommended it to any middle-tier-manager who is looking for a real world IT framework.However, I have some complaints about this second edition:- The paper quality is really awful.... I'm afraid about highlight it, because it seems it will tear-apart. What it is the issue with pages of white color? It is really disappointing paying almost USD 100 for a book (including international shipping) and receive a so ugly product.- There are some topics recently included in this new edition which seems copy-and-pasted from wiki. For instance: Extreme programming, or development methodologies: they are not really correlated with the chapter's content and you feel that they were included just to give a sense of up-to-date but not really comprehended by the authors."
5,"Six stars for content, business value, pragmatism & style","This is a ""best book"" for Executives and Managers responsible for IT management related decisions and practices. Therefore I rank it with ""6""! stars. Peter de Toma, Austria, Europe."
1,disappointed,"I was expecting results which I had gotten from another peppermint gel. This sone did not meet my expectations. It may help nausea, I am not sure, but does not seem to help with colon probleNow Foods Peppermint Gels, Soft-gels, 180-Countms."
1,Bad Millet,"The 5 lbs of millet I purchased is very old. My five Finches and Canary (all millet loving birds) will not touch it. If I put a competitors brand in their cages they stay on it untill it's gone. I now have 4 lbs 9 oz of product left which will go into the trash.I suspect that this product is stored in a big warehouse and they rotate out the old dried out millet to make room for the freshly harvested millet.I decided not to put this in the trash, instead I hung the entire two boxes of millet out in the back yard for the wild birds. I have a lot of Gold Finches and Cassins Finches and they won't touch this stuff either.Lesson learned, I won't be buying this again."
3,"overall, pretty good book","The book did have some irritating mistakes in the back (no more than the average math book), but I give it a thumbs up for being pretty clear and readable throughout. Some problems I had using the book though are:-it doesn't provide adequate examples, too few and not on the same level as the problems-towards the end, it loses some coherence by splitting up related ideas into many formulas and notations.Overall word, the book teaches pretty well, but a good teacher is really needed to wade through some of the book."
2,Loooooooong winded.,"This textbook is so long winded. When it tells personal stories related to the topics, it is very interesting. However, when it gets technical, boy does it get technical. It seems as if it wants to confuse the reader on purpose. The index is worthless. For example, a question on the test will ask about the Neur men, look for Neur in the index and you get nothing. However, it is in the book. The glossary is just a contnuation of the confusing overly technical speak this book does too well.Bottom line, if you have a decent prof. then this book will suffice, otherwise be prepared to feel like you are being tortured for the secret rocket code."
2,A Liberal look at Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger before he was Pope,"This is a biography of the German cleric born Joseph Ratzinger in 1927. John Allen Jr. is a journalist for the 'National Catholic Reporter' and in this book traces Ratzinger's rise to prominence as a cardinal during the Second Vatican Council as a firm proponent of Vatican II's progressive theology an opponent of tradition. The author then uses documents to outline the pope's conservative theological views on controversial subjects as the Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.This book was originally titled 'Cardinal Ratzinger' and should have been left with that title. Though I suggest all read this book for another point of view, by no means let this be the only book you read. Allen himself wished to re-write what he wrote but the publisher went ahead with his original biased writings. Before you make up your mind be sure to read Ratzinger's own writings in their complete form and draw your own conclusions."
5,"Great fun for being an ""informational"" source!","I love this book and am having such fun reading it. Shane Smith shares himself in such a way that although I've never met the man, I now think of him as a friend! His writing style is easy going and often very funny and personal and the information he imparts is useful, and obviously comes from years of real experience. Running even a hobby greenhouse can be expensive with all the gadgets, yet he gives good and practical advice for those who don't necessarily have the means to buy the biggest and best of everything the manufactures would like to sell you! He tells you what you really need to have and know, and what's just ""fluff."" I would recommend that anyone with a hobby greenhouse invest in this book."
5,A wonderful resource and an entertaining read,"I own a couple of dozen books on building and using greenhouses, and have been in the process of building a solar-heated, earth-sheltered greenhouse for the past couple of months. This book is one of the most entertaining and educational greenhouse volumes I've seen. He has a fun, conversational writing style that makes it feel like he's standing there in the greenhouse with you, giving you advice and discussing how to do things. One third or so of the book is basically reference information about different plants, including how to grow them, and why you should (or should not) grow them in your greenhouse. Even then, his witty remarks and observations make it much less dry than most of the similar books I've read. Highly recommended."
4,Great book and fun read,This book is a fun read and it provides great information for those interested in building your own greenhouse. I also suspect that even a seasoned greenhouse gardener could benefit from reading it as well. I would recommend to anyone interested in greenhouse gardening.
2,"Unstable, and expensive","I've now tried the device on two different WinXP based systems, with the same results. Out of the box, the device would not recognize most SCSI devices I attached to it, and once I changed the config of the various addresses to not use the default, the device drivers supplied with the device cause a kernel panic in XP the instant anything is attached to it.You can't get at the config without attaching a device, when you do, you get a kernel panic, and you can't reset the config any other way.It's basically a brick now, and emails to the company concerning drivers that don't crash or other methods of resetting the config have gone unanswered."
3,Two sides to this headset,"The sound/microphone quality is good... However, the microphone might stop working eventually. That happened to me, and while it is covered by the Plantronics guarantee, I no longer have my bill so I'm screwed.I still use them though because the sound still works great."
2,Mic stopped working,"After one month the microphone stopped working. Actually, if you yell into it some sound will transmit.At the time my son was 1 yr old and he would pull the cord until it fell off the desk onto carperted floor. Also, he would suck on the foam tip. I expected this and was hoping the mic would last longer."
3,Plantronics Headset,"Noting that this is a low end headset, the unit performs it's function well. Sound volume controls are sufficently well placed for good control and an ample lenght of cord for any setup. Sound quality is rated very good. The headset adjustment could be a little easier to set, but overall, a good buy for the novice"
4,I like it,"I just got this headset a few weeks ago. I use it for Skype. It works great. It's comfortable and the sound is good. Every once in a while there'll be a weird echo, but only when I speak very loudly and I'm too close to the mic. I've used it to listen to music a couple of times too and again the sound is great."
1,Dont waste your money,"I bought this headset and was very pleased with the sound quality and the mic quality, but it breaks very easily and very often. My second pair of these headphones has just broken, having the sound cutting in and out and not being able to hear certain tones.Most of the good reviews for this headset are from people who havent had the headset for very long. If you want a reliable headset, take my advice and look elsewhere."
2,Bought two both broke within a year.,"This is a high quality headset, but just not durable. More so, that the line from the back of the pc to the headset is not thick with good insulation and that is the main reason it is not durable. It start with one side of the headset with no sound then both."
4,Definitely worth it,"It's worth the cash. The product seems well built (a little heavy) but the audio quality for both the headset and the microphone seem excellent. I've got an average size head (I think) and the headset seems just a little big on me, maybe by about 1/2 inch. I've got it set to its smallest size, wish they made it a little smaller, but I'm getting used to it."
4,Great.. satisfying,This headset is good. Great steorophonic sound headphone and mic. Its worth a buy.
3,"Use for gaming, not for singing...",This headset is great if you are going to use it for dictation or for gaming on-line. I bought it for completing some music projects but the delay between the headset and my computer made it impossible to get the voice track to match up with the actual music.
1,I'm in the 4th one...,it's great until it breaks... i bought it at a local store and return it twice and send to the manufacture twice.
5,Tasty headphones,Very comfortable and quite solid. These headphones plugged directly into my soundcard and worked immediately. Very user friendly and pleasant to use.
4,A bit loose fitting,"I purchased this headset for use with Yahoo Instant Messenger with Voice. It was at a reasonable price and it works as I was able to speak to the other person and I heard them clearly, so I'm satisfied, but it was a bit tricky to adjust the microphone so that it didn't brush against my mouth as I was speaking. Can't seem to quite get it to fit snuggly on my head."
3,Satisfied with first ever headest.,"Having used the headset with skype (to landline) and windows xp sound recorder, it works. The sound quality is mediocre, at best, but this could be the old 1/8th inch input connector on my laptop. Bulky but comfy. Enjoy"
1,Economically Illiterate,"The Marxists posited subsequent stages of socialism and communism, and others debated how, when and why peoples moved from one stage to another. Rifkin's novel contribution is to identify the emerging European postmodernist society as the next stage. Instead of a proletarian revolution ushering in central planning, we are to have a centralized bureaucratic revolution that will plan proletarian immobilization.Has this dude ever taken an Econ 101 class?Seems not..."
1,A book that will appeal to the envy of America,"200 years ago, European nations dominated the world in absolutely every aspect-culturally, economically, militarily, etc. Now, in the 21st Century, the tables have dramatically changed across the Atlantic. The U.S. is now the strongest superpower the world has ever seen. For the first time in history, there is a nation out there with the might and influence greater than Europe COMBINED. If one doesn't believe me, just look the stats up and compare them. One example would be that the US spends more on its military and on technology than the rest of the world COMBINED, let alone old Europe. And people wonder why the most high-tech nation on Earth..."
2,Imitation scholarship,"Yes, Rifkin's descriptions of the cultural differences between Americans and Europeans make interesting reading, but the vast majority of what he says is anecdotal, if not inaccurate. I found it amusing to read his praise of Europe's assimilation of immigrants when riots were occurring all over France. And the idea that the popularity of subscription services and auto leasing means companies are now in the business of selling ""time"" rather than material products is absurd."
3,"Decent, a bit long at times and slanted, but makes you think","Rifkin does put forth some very compelling ideas on the differences of society within American and European life. However, the book is very biased towards the European perspective. Rifkin himself an American, admires the future that the European Union is heading. He delivers some very biased statistics (ex: comparing the economies of U.S. states to independent sovereign nation states of the EU). It's no surprise to find out that at the time of the book's publication he was working for Romano Prodi, president of the European Commission. Overall, it's definitly not a must-read, very euro-centric, but does offer some good analysis of the different societies."
2,OK if you can't be bothered to search,"Although much of the information contained in this book is available through other sources--www.onewedding.co.uk, for example--it is likely to be useful for someone in the beginning stages of planning their wedding and reception."
1,Not Helpful for Us,"This book is full of information, but none of it hit home for us. We came away with only one idea that we are actually going to use and found many of the sayings and toasts to be very cheesy."
2,Disappointing...to say the least,"At $17.95 I figured this book would be useful for both the beginner & advanced roaster. It is barely useful for the beginner. You can easily obtain all info contained in this book plus much more by going online, typing ""coffee roasting"" in your search engine, & hitting the ""go"" button. This book might be worth $5.00!"
2,not so great,"Unfortunately, this is one of the weaker books that I have seen in about mosaic art. Not a how-to book, it is supposed to demonstrate a range of examples of mosaic art. I find the photos to be too small in many cases, and a lot of projects too amateurish. A few projects did look good, but the photographs were not good enough to examine the details of the work or the quality of the mosaics. I would not recommend this book."
4,A little small,"Relatively small for a sugar bowl. Find myself filling it often. Also lid is a little awkward with no ""button"" on top by which to lift it off. Love Portmerion pattern though."
2,Details Please.....,"I have to agree with the other reviews. However, as an instructor, looking at this from the perspective of the student, there is a *major* tendency to skip steps that leaves you trying to figure out what to do next. If you don't have any previous flash experience, or experience using graphics applications, keep looking. This isn't a book for the beginner."
3,Good for a newbie and not so new to Flash,I liked this book and would recommend it. The first critique I do of a book of this sort is work with the index. When I am new to an application I will look up things by the index that I immediately want to know rather than the TofC. I find most books on computer graphics and design are iffy in the index area. This book satisfied my quest. The only downside I have on this book is the visual layout. I found the font distracting ... personal choice I am sure but content was good.
3,At least it covers ActionScripting,I mainly bought this book for it's coverage of ActionScripting - which is the most thorough that I've seen - after waisting my money on the Flash 4 Bible. The only thing that I don't like is that my book is falling apart - I think they need better binding!
4,Web Design for Dummies Review,"This book is a great overview of the Website Design business. There are so many different functions of the website design process, more than I imagined. This book will not tell you step by step how to design a website. It more gives you a direction on what you may want to choose to learn first. If you want to build a website start with learning about HTML,Adobe Photoshop, Java or Flash books. Still a great read for someone who is just starting. Good tips in the book on sizing and color regarding consistancy on how different browsers will show the website."
1,Total junk,"This microwave from Whirlpool came with my new house when i bought it. after the first six months of use the handle, top grate/vent thingy and paint where all coming off or broken. A year into use and now the microwave wont even work. The funny thing is all my neighbors have the same microwave and there's are doing the same thing. Consumer beware."
3,Well worth the read,"The Lamb is an intriguing and entertaining approach to the fulfillment of one of the greatest prophecies in Christendom, the return of the Son. Mr. Burnett skillfully develops characters, possibilities and circumstance that not only create an exciting story line and fantastic climax, but addresses personal human qualities of fear, doubt, greed, courage, and faith. Josh Adon, our main character, is a good man that finds himself unknowingly resisting the very things in life that he desires, his success and happiness. As he recognizes and accepts his celestial calling, Josh finds that the elements of his life that he seemed so sure were obstacles to his success were, in actuality, the catalyst to it. The Lamb is a great non-stop read and will offer provocative insights into religion, politics, and human nature."
4,Fun bird,"I bought this for my son and he really enjoys the audobon birds a lot. He enjoys the sounds and the information that comes along with the birds, and he plays with them a lot."
2,pot luck,"This book is somewhat over-rated and hyped up! The Author appears to be a Palero and also claims some involvement with Brazilian Quimbanda/Kimbanda...which indeed shows in the information presented in this book. However, Mr Montenegro is obviously not able to distinguish between these two traditions and mixes and matches at his leasure...This book is pot-luck and can easylie burn your finders. The proof that this man knows little to nothing is in his American Candomble Church - youtube videos where he cant even pronounce the names of the spirits!"
1,Can't Judge this book by its Title!,"VBA Programming for the Absolute Beginner, I have to say I'm very disappointed with this book, You certainly can't judge this book by its title!It seems like it'd be great if you're already an expect macro writer and just need a reminder about what certain functions do. If that's not you, then this book is probably not for you.I'm a beginner and had trouble at the beginning of the book (page 12). does not work if your using Excel 97, but I have both '97 & 2003 and had problems with both systems. Why would one continue on in a book where you can't get the 1st example to work? I'm sending it back!"
1,A real stopper!,"If you are a beginner then lookout, the code at the very beginning of the book (page 12) does not work if your using Excel 97. What better to have failure at the very beginning and have no way to determine what the problem might be. Why would one continue on in a book where you can't get the 1st example to work?"
4,"Not for beginners, but very good","I'd have to agree that this book is not appropriately named. I found understanding the code more difficult than several books aimed at a moderately advanced audience, such as Walkenbach's Power Programming.That said, I found the book offered unique angles and insights not dealt with in other books, and in showing how games can be programmed in Excel, really provided a broad view of the power and flexibility inherent in VBA and the Excel Object model. It was frankly an eye opener to see what Duane was able to do, and I think taking the time to work through the code has been tremendously rewarding, if not particularly easy."
5,Perfect stones for a casual set,"These stones came in good condition and are of great quality. None of the stones arrived cracked, and the bowls were likewise in good condition. The carrying case is convenient as well. The stones are pleasantly heavy and only one or two had any noticeable defects. Yunzi is a wonderful material - not much like glass, but rather more like stone. All in all, worth the cost."
4,Happy with purchase,I was very impressed. It arrived very quickly and was in good condition. They are nice stones and worth the money if you want to buy high quality without breaking the bank.
5,I love this thing!,"I bought this walkman about 3 months ago and I absolutely love it! It has never once skipped on me, the batteries last forever, and its so convenient to be able to hang it off of the treadmill instead of having to hold onto it the whole time you're exercising. I was a little unsure of buying it at first (b/c it is so expensive) but it's definitely worth it! I would definitely recommend this product!"

2,If you have nothing better to do....,"If you have nothing better to do then you might read this book. I'm the type of person who has to finish reading a book once I start, but it was hard since this story wasn't really interesting.I'm not going into the story or the characters, you can read the synopsis yourself...but I've already wasted too much time on this book."
5,Easy reading,"If english is not your natural language, this is perfect.Intense and exiting.Descibes the life and love of a gay boy,living in a disfunctional family. He's learned to please to be loved."
3,An attempt at something literary,"This book has high asperations, but unfortunately for Grimsley, his talent does not match his ambition. This is an easy, quick read, and it is little more than a gay romance/erotica story with a heavy-handed poetic flair. An ambitious failure by an author with a very disagreeable personality."
2,Read it if you're not expecting much.,"Dream Boy is a fine read if you take it for what it's worth: a sometimes disturbing, but sweet book about a young gay rural man. However, if you demand well-developed characters, original plots, or thought provoking verbage, you may want to skip it or read it during a quick car ride."
2,What The?!,"This little novel is an undeniably well written failure. Jim Grimsley obviously has a way with words, but what he also has is a plausible (if somewhat thread-bare and depressing) plot that takes a 'huh?'-inspiring turn into the horror genre 9/10ths of the way through the book. Other people obviously feel differently than I do, but I think that if you're going to write a novel, choose a genre and stick to it. Tom Clancy doesn't have elves popping up at the end of his books and Danielle Steele doesn't end books with covert special forces operations. A good book with a similar romantic theme and without the wandering plot is K.M. Soehnlein's ""The World Of Normal Boys"", which I would recommend."
3,"Good, But Not For Those Who Like Quality Writing","Cornwell's King Arthur books have the same strengths and weaknesses as do his Sharpe's books. These can be a fun read, the action is good, and the research is good. But what eventually causes me to grind to a halt with Cornwell is his prose. His writing is like reading hurried jornalism -- flat, undistinguished, and monotonous. The editorial review suggests that this is American diction, but Cornwell is, in fact, English. It's just language without music. For myself, I need better prose to stick with someone, and for popular ficton that means someone such as P.D. James or John Le Carre, who have the ability both to engage you with their style and to entertain you with the story. Cornwell is okay reading, but eventually I just look elsewhere."
5,Wonderful read.,"I'm not really a fan of King Arthur and Camelot, so I was hesitant to read this book. But, of course, I love Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe Series, Starbuck Series and Grail Quest Series, so I thought I'd give this a shot. I'm glad I did. Because this version is so different and realistic made it a wonderful read."
1,"Trashy 1950s TV version, NOT 1930s Buster Crabbe movie serials.","The series you want to see is the one produced as a movie serial in the late 1930s starring Buster Crabbe and Jean Rogers. It's a wonderful series. And it's the version illustrated on the accompanying poster for this product. But what you actually get is a lousy adaptation which was shown on TV in the 1950s. CreateSpace is either too inept to know the difference, or knows but doesn't care so long as you'll buy it."
1,Power supply without power cord,"This article does not include power cords, amazon not specify, I think it was a mistake to buy this item"
3,Okay but lacking a few things,"This product didn't seem quite the same as when I first purchased it over a year ago. There are two things that I am not completely thrilled about. One is the plastic sheet that the earlift is attached to. You would typically peel the earlift off of the sheet and voila there you have it. I guess they were trying to do something different with that by making each earlift punch out of the sheet separately, making it harder to remove the sticky earlift from the tiny, superthin plastic backing. This particular set wasn't as sticky as before either. The adhesive is less stringent and it tends to move when putting the earring through. Overall I would say I am glad that I have them, but they are definitely different."
2,Does not stick!,"Ok, so I bought these thinking they would be like the one's at claire's maybe better. WRONG! These do not even stick for a good hour before they start coming off and I have lost more earrings with this product because it falls out with my earring. Will NOT be purchasing again."
4,Excellent detector for the money,"....I have been very impressed by this detector. It does what it's supposed to do and comes with no frills unlike the other more expensive detectors with voice, compass, GPS...etcThe only drawback I see from this detector (as with most detectors) is that it's pretty hopeless when it's up against Laser (Lidar) guns. When you hear the warning, it's already too late to react. It's not sensitive enough to pick up reflected/refracted laser signals from the cars ahead. And I doubt the rearward facing laser sensor is of any real use either.And sometimes, it falses on the emergency services band (giving an ambulance-like siren tone).But overall, it's a decent detector, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a good radar detector without overshooting the $$$$range."
5,A Must For Titanic Enthusiasts!,"This book was published in 1995, and sadly just missed the Titanic film-fever that swept the planet. That aside, this book is indespensible to anyone with an interest in films or the Titanic. The book goes into great detail about virtually every film made on the subject. Full of rare pictures. It also covers the subject as seen on TV. Hopefully the author will do an update to include the awful 1996 TV movie and Camerons epic."
3,Copies XP OK Vista not.....,My kaptop was configured with XP Pro and Vista Business Edition. When upgrading fom an 80gb to 160gb drive I used DiskCopy and Clean. Results. Only the XP partition works. I had to reset the boot paths in Vista only to find massive access issues related to missing or corrupt permissions. I May have to reinstall Vista or find another brand of software to finish myy migration. Point is software works with XP but not Vista.
1,Buy Beer Instead!,"Please pay attention to all these reviews! I had a computer with an almost-full 20 GB partition, so I thought this would be a great product to move this partition, and the two others on the drive, to a new larger HD. DiskCopy and Clean has all the proper graphics and recognizes the old and new HD's nicely. Everthing is great until you tell the software to perform the copy process. DiskCopy and Clean runs for anywhere from 6 seconds, to around 26 minutes, and then locks up completely. For the record, the new HD is a 400 GB WD that worked fine in another computer. BTW, the DiskCopy software now indicates that it will be done in 1026 hours, 13 minutes, and 16 seconds. Buy something else!!"
5,Helen's done a wonderful job!,"This little book on green tea is written by an experienced, well, maybe professional I should have said, tea drinker and pratitioner in the US. You will get lots of information on this little book. It will turn you into a *knowledgeable* tea drinker overnight.Helen gives a brief survey on the popular and finer green teas as well as on tea preparations and teawares... It would be a great pleasure to read. However, I wish she would make the description more elaborate. For example, if she could give a more detailed description on the Dragon Well, High Mountain (Dong Ding--Cold Summit) OOlong, Bi Luo Chun, ...the finer teas, then a greater pleasure to read.Also you can find many useful and trustworthy resources from which you order quality teas. I highly recommend this book to any tea lovers as well as anyone who wants to give it a shot to tea!"
4,Bring More Live-Performance Steve Goodman CD's Out!,"There must be more of this stuff in the vaults somewhere-I remember a wonderful PBS ""SoundStage"" with Steve, Arlo Guthrie, and Hoyt Axton in 1974 that was worth the price of admission for ""Door Number Three"" alone. Meantime, buy this and save it for an early Sunday morning, it's a good example of what Steve did best. Intimate, quietly inventive and delightful at times, definitive ""Video Tape"" and ""Somebody Else's Troubles"", and the early morning ambiance can't be beat. Special blessings to Vin Scelsa for reassembling it and the fine liner notes, but he should also be throttled for not continuing the Easter morning tradition with Goodman while he could."
3,Proctor-Silex 48574 Automatic Drip Coffeemaker,It makes coffee. I am not a coffee expert but I have tasted better brewed coffee. Since buying this coffeemaker I have discovered I like the cone shaped filters better than the flat bottomed bowl shaped filter that this coffeemaker uses. It is an OK coffeemaker. It still is working after a year and for the price that is good.
5,GREEN SHIMMER!,WOW....The picture does not do this justice. It's a beautiful bead necklace with gorgeous color. I was so pleased when I opened my package and saw it. The craftmanship is excellent! And the price is so reasonable. I can't wait to wear it!
5,A terrific series--a great buy for the $,"I'd never seen this show before and bought it on a whim cause I love military documentaries. What a treat; it was WAY better than I expected and a bargain. I also liked how they start at the modern evolvement of different weapons and trace the history and different componenets that go into bringing it about. If you've ever seen the show ""Connections"" on PBS you'll recognize the presentation format and really like it. I'd give this a show 10 stars if it was an option."
4,Kokopeli's flute P.T,"Kokopelli's Flute is a great book.I definitely recommend this book to kids that are ages 10 and above.It's a great,mysterious story about a boy named Tepary who lives in the southwestern part of the U.S.He learns the ways of the ''ancient ones''.Wierd but exciting things happen to him.This is a very special unique book that I highly recommend!"
1,Crap,"Made a single pot of coffee and water started leaking out of the cold water reservoir through the base of the machine and all over the counter.Nothing obvious; no cracks, holes or any other visible leak points -- but the water just poured through the machine and out the bottom.Unfortunately, I had already discarded the box -- so no returns."
2,Be careful when there is no picture!,"I needed this book for my college course, unfortunately this is the wrong edition.The item description should really include what edition the book is.I noticed some sellers took it upon themselves to mention the edition in the ""seller comments"" field. Most seller do not think to do this and so this is why I suggest YOU, the buyer, to ""be careful when there is no picture!""Good Luck!!"
5,A good review or learn the basics,"If you want to learn about amps and tubes, this video should do it. I think it is all explained well."
3,"Good comprehensive text, but poor mass balance chapter","A very comprehensive text that covers both water and wastewater treatment. While most of the text is okay, the mass balances chapter is poorly written."
5,"As much as i hate to admit it, Kelly looked better in the dress","Meeting Mr Pony is the first episode I ever saw when I was like err..9 or 10. I was hooked. I can't wait for this season. The best season. Total insanity: Brenda and Kelly wearing the same horrid dress, Scott shooting himself, Brenda's perfect bangs and Steve's ridiculous hair (well, its ridiculous every season but..)"
1,It's the music...,"For true fans of ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" - especially the Second Season which was one of the best - not hearing the original music is bad enough... what's so much worse is the horrible, amateur, ""home-made"" music they replaced the original music with! Truly, it makes some of the scenes unwatchable. For example, when David gets them all to dance at Scott's birthday party -- the song they chose to replace the original doesn't even have the same beat so the characters are all dancing off-beat. At other times, the fake music is so awful it's distracting. I know it doesn't seem like the music should make such a difference but it does. You'd be far, far better off taping the show off Soapnet - it's on every day and on weekends, too."
2,Hummmmmmmmm,I plugged this into my laptop and recorded a sound file. There was a noticeable hum at the low end in the recording. Sent it back.
5,Steve Goodman CD,"The CD arrived bebore the date it was expected. I had a great experience and would order from them again. No problems at all.Thanks and I appreciate,Dianne"
5,The title explains the album,"For a collector that enjoys minimalism, such as Kronos or Terry Riley, this album should be required. The subtlety of the cadences of the various instruments and voice create an illusion of being taken somewhere else with a vividness that few artists can capture.The use of glass and other obsure and invented instruments is sublime; it's almost as if Gabriella Roth is recording with John Cage-- Frasconi captures the rythmic smothness of Roth and carries the poetic boldness of Cage.I truly hope Miquel Frasconi puts out more works like these; this recording is a wonderful piece to relax to and enjoy a good coversation..."
3,'80s Folklore Feel,"I really like the idea of the kids helping kids, reminiscent of Lady in White from the '80s, one of my favorites... this movie has serious flaws, the gory kills are badly prepared and paced, the ending is ridiculous.Other than that I do really like the movie, though the parents also were rather one dimensional... good dad, crazy one dimensional mom, who was annoying.This movie has some awesome moments, and the ghost story arc is fantastic... also, Lou Diamond Philips is always good.I gave it a 7 though."
3,Fingerprint,"it is a ok movie with not many scary parts at all , its been done before is the feeling I got after watching it"
4,Worth it,It was a little corny at times but I thought generally it was a good movie. I would defiantly recommend it.
1,Probably One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"Bad acting. Unrealistic plot. Nothing scary about it.Don't waste your time. If I could have given it a 0, I would have."
4,Stunted Bethlehemline Diversity,"This is the best, much hilarity and tittilating variety await you. Find this rare disc somewhere and burn a copy for your departed loved ones. There is no ex-mas without a Katis under the missile tow. And I speak from experience, maybe."
5,Can't Get Enough,"I had seen Hinder in concert before I bought this CD and I have to say they are better in concert, but you can't see their concert everyday. The CD is almost as good as them in concert. So if you like bands like Panic! at the Disco or Fall Out Boy, this is a great CD to add to your collection. Also be sure to like music about love, hate, and drugs. The first song is called ""Get Stoned"", and it is a good song. I love this so much I listen to it as much as I can."
1,If You Spend Real American Money On This...,"You have morbid curiosity or are insane.Listening to this makes me want to (a)join a Shiite Religious party or (b) pour molten lead into my ears. ""Lips Of An Angel"" is the most flatulent bit of bilge ever dotted electronically on a piece of plastic. Rock and Roll is clearly dead.Hinder ='s Meat Loaf without the talent. No wonder they 'got signed' to a major label."
5,HINDER HINDER HINDER,I definitely recommend this cd. Hinder is one of my favorite bands. Lips of an angel and Better then me are the greatest songs on this album. I can just listen to them over and over again without getting sick of them. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.
4,"I liked it the 1st time, when it was called Nickelback","So here's the thing, everyone is saying that this band sucks because they sound just like Nickelback. When did that become a bad things. Last time I checked, everyone likes Nickelback (even you) and no one wants to admit it. All their albums go platinum, somebody has to be buying them.Hinder is another generic rock band with solid songs that are easy to listen to. They are nothing special, but what exactly is special in these dark days of rock.So stop pretending you're too musically savvy to like music like this and buy the cd."
3,"i don't own it, but i just have to say...","How stupid is everyone on here? Excuse me, everyone who thinks they sound like nickelback. Vocally, the lead singer actually sounds like a mix of Bad Religion and Social Distortion(minus the southern drawl). You people are really lacking a comparitive ear. And Musically, I'm more into heavy music, bands like All That Remains, Lamb of God, Behemoth, nice Death metal stuff. But even still... it's good solid rock. Not the heaviest, not the lightest. I'm not even saying it's really that great, though I do very much enjoy lips of an angel. Learn to appreciate music for what it is, or you are just one of the stereotypical sheep that get lead to the slaughter. In other words, you are too narrowminded. Gawd, you all piss me off!"
3,Hinder CD,The first-half of the first song on this CD skips quite badly. The remainder of the CD plays perfectly.
5,Best CD I Have Bought In 5 Years,"I am not always up to date in the music biz, but I do try and at least listen to the radio, of course it's usually the 80's and 90's on satellite radio! My teenage cousin actually introduced me to Hinder one day in his truck. Man, I like what I heard. I checked at a local store, but it was edited, so I came on Amazon. I didn't even read the reviews, just ordered it. I am impressed. It is not very often that you can buy a cd and enjoy most of the songs on it. I usually only find 2-3 songs on most cd's. I actually like most of the Hinder songs. I was born in '77 so I grew up in the 80's and 90's. I sometimes feel that rock is not rock anymore, but Hinder was more rock to me than ""alternative"" or whatever label people give them. I gave Hinder 5 stars here because I can honestly say it is the best cd I have bought in 5 years, and that's saying a lot. Great job guys."
2,"Ok, we're stoned, now what??","Unfortunately after Get Stoned, which really isn't THAT great of a song in the first place, there's not much but alot of fluff that will remind you of 80's music...which isn't a good thing at all. Also, reviewers claiming this is too much like Nickelback....I suppose I can see a slight similarity in a few songs as far as the vox (vocals) but for the most part the two are nothing alike musically...Nickelback's new cd is in stores now and there's a few rockers on there that just put this to shame."
3,Better than emo,"Although it does have a striking resemblence to other bands such as Nickelback and Buckcherry, I would rather listen to this band than all other ""creative"" bands many would offer as a stark contrast to Hinder. This music is much better than any emo band (Panic at the Disco) or some whiny piano player like Daniel Powter and James Blunt. The music is catchy and can at least be considered rock music and a man can't be ashamed in saying they like this band. They obviously aren't the greatest thing to music but at least they're not emo."
4,Hinder Album,"I liked this CD, but I didn't find it to be as spectacular as some of my freind's seem to. I think the band's stronger points rely on the faster songs about emotional loss, such as ""Bliss"" and ""Homecoming Queen."""
4,Power Pop Returns,"I picked up this CD because I liked ""Lips Of An Angel"", and yes I originally thought it was Nickelback (not really a fan of theirs). This music isn't rock or grunge, it's good old fashioned power pop, and who isn't a sucker for that! Hinder I think is a current version of Cheap Trick; catchy hooks, simple lyrics and a lead vocalist that fit the music well, and decent musicianship. Keep that in mind if you are thinking of buying the CD and you won't go wrong."
5,Get over the cheating song,"Get tired of hearing... ""The cheating guy song."" Hey, excuse me...listen to the song. The song is about TWO people being in a relationship and realizing they still love one another. Hince...""Does he know you're talking to me? Will it start a fight?"" in the second verse. There you have it folks. So don't be ready to call the ""Lync Mob"" on just the guy. TWO people are involved with this so called ""Cheater"" song. Love works that way sometimes. It's cold yeah, but it does. I recommend taking time to fully heal the pain before moving on to another relationship though. Using people to help get over someone else always causes fireworks.Other than this, the CD is great. Good music. Love ""By The Way"". Great song too."
3,Nice book but.....,"THis is a pretty book and tells a lot about yarn, dying etc. All things I want to learn - later. I would not recommend it to new sock knitters. It is not a how to knit socks. But a good book for my library."
4,Good Entry-Level Receiver,"Sony's STR-DE485 is quite a good entry-level A/V receiver. The sound is crisp and clean with little distortion at any volume level, and the FM tuner can lock on to even the weakest stations. With 6 available inputs, the unit is capable and a great component to build a home theater around.Sony also offers the longest warranty in the industry -- competing receivers offer only a 1 year or 90 day warranty while Sony covers both parts and labor for a full two years.Quality and warranty aside, however, the Sony name commands a price premium as opposed to competing products in its price level from Pioneer, Kenwood, and others. Competing models may include S-Video inputs and Doly Pro Logic II decoding, both of which Sony's STR-DE485 lacks. Most comparable receivers also offer an output of 100 watts x 5 channels, where the STR-DE485 only offers 80 watts x 5 channels."
5,Debunking the myths.,"First off let me say that NHL94 is unquestionably the greatest video game of all time. However a certain myth about the game has surfaced in one pop culture reference. I feel it's my duty as the games's greatest player and ambassador to dispell the misrepresentation. Many people think that ""Swingers"" featured Trent & Sue playing NHL94 in the movie. This is not true. They were playing NHL93, a great game by all accounts but no NHL94. I believe this myth began because the characters incorrectly had a discussion involving the inability to fight in the game. They then went on to make Wayne's head bleed which was presented as the violent tradeoff for the lack of fighting. However as many people know there was both fighting and head bleeding in NHL93 while NHL94 had neither. I hope this clears up any confusion."
4,A fun Game You'll want to play agian and agian.,"A very fun game you'll enjoy.You can play 1 player mode and 2 player mode.You get to pick your favorite digimon from seasons1-3.you can pick Augumon,Gabumon,Patamon,Terriermon,Guilmon,Renemon,Wormmon,Veemon and Gatomon.To get more digimon you have to uncover them in the one player mode.When you do you'll end up uncovering Reapermon,Blackwargreymon,Omnimon,Impmon and Imperialdramon palid mode.You can also Digivolve into your mega Form By pushing the R1 button.You get MetalGarurumon, Wargreymon,Seraphimon,Mega Gargomon,Gallantmon,Sakuyamon,Imperialdramon,Magnadramon and Beelzemon.You can also get Champion digimon Stingmon.I like to fight with Guilmon and Impmon because they digivolve into strong Mega digimon.The game even has cool mini games like a digivolving race that after a While your thumb might hurt for pushing the button too many times.A Basketball mini game and a target race.For a Play Station game it's Fun Espicially if you like digimon."
5,Digimon Rumble Arena is a GREAT GAME!,Digimon Rumble Arena is a great game. There are a whole bunch of characters which are from all 3 seasons. Each one has it's own attacks. There are also many secret cahracters. You can also unlock digimon by inputting passwords. I don't know any but I unlocked all of them. In my opinion there is only 1 con. Reapermon is too powerful. All his moves do too much. His O button attack does twice as much as regular O button attacks. I think the best digimon is either Omnimon or Imperialdramon. They have both long range and close range attacks. YOU SHOULD BUY IT!
3,I cannot recommend highly enough!!,"This is a fine, inspiring, wonderful book. Author Haupt has done incredible research, an awesome amount of pure work, and her writing is beautiful. The book combines observations on nature, a poetic sense, and wonderful detail on Charles Darwin. I have never had much interest in him, but now want to learn as much as I can.If you love Mary Oliver's poetry or John McPhee's essays, if you are interested in nature, the cosmos, theology, poetry, or just plain wonder about life and nature and how we got here, you will want to read this book. If I had the money, I'd buy 15 copies to keep on hand for gifts: perfect for anyone ill (who likes to read), for a birthday present, to take on a trip, etc. Instead, I bought one copy as a gift for myself, and it's one of the best I've ever received! Books like this are a rarity.Do not miss it!"
4,"Strange, Yeah....But How True?","Strange But True is a potpourri of bite-sized stories about (Surprise!) strange people and/or events. I am a ""Strangeness Buff"", and even though I have a TON of books that run along the same lines, there was a lot here that was new to me, and a lot that makes you want to read more; The chapters on Springheel Jack and The Tunguska Alien were especially interesting. Slemen's writing is compelling, and his style makes for fun reading.The drawback was that the book has no bibliography, so it's impossible to do any further digging for information, and there's no telling where Slemen got his facts from. As such, that always left me feeling a tad doubtful about some of the more unbelieveable stuff.....It is a fun book, though, and fans of the Unexplained will have a good time."
5,Clamp has done it again,"I fell in love with CLAMP's beautiful art style after reading Magic Knights Rayearth. I then decide to look into more by them and discovered the cutsey world of Card Captor Sakura. One day while browsing a comic shop I saw a black paper-bound graphic novel called X/1999. I picked it up to get a better look and discovered that this was also by CLAMP. I purchased it and was amazed. Instead of the Kawaii characters I was used to from CLAMP the main character was a short, black-haired young man with somthing bad in his past. The plot and the characters are intense and pull you right into the story. Even if you don't like reading manga read this and I Promise you will. The movie version, called simply ""X"" was also good but it does not let you meet the characters. Read the manga then see the movie, you will love it. ^_^ I promise!"
2,"Not the best, but not the worst either","If you want a boxing game that's really old, and you just love your Genesis, get this. The graphics are pretty rough, but that doesn't stop a game from being fun. The gameplay is simple and enjoyable for a little while, and the sound quality is what you'd expect from a 16-bit game. Recommended for fans of the genre only."
4,Good boxing game,"Toughman Contest is a pretty good boxing game on the Genesis.It's got some cool boxers to choose from,and go up against other boxers from across the world.There is the contest you can enter...or a single one on one match,against the computer.The graphics are very good in this game.The sounds are a bit muffled,but it's really not a big deal.Toughman Contest can be a bit tough though,so it defintely takes some time to get used to the controls and such.There are plenty of cheat passwords that can be used in this game as well.Here are a couple for you...for invinsibility...type in MAXX and for all the moves type in MRBUCKEYE.Overall,Toughman Contest is a nice little boxing title to add to your Sega Genesis game collection. Ps...check out the hot ring girls in this game too! ;)"
3,Durango DB710,Awesome product except its hard to slip on as it should have a rip on the side to allow comfort fit. I struggled to wear the boot which was annoying.
1,And this author is respected in the literary world!,"How Philip Young earned the respect of his colleages is a mystery to me. So is his reasoning in ""Hawthorne's Secret: An Untold Tale."" Cleary without any kind of grasp on Hawthorne's life or work, Young took scraps of ""evidence"" and then drew an unlikely conclusion, calling it Hawthorne's ""secret."" It's unfortunate that trees had to die for this bit of speculation."
5,Now *THAT* is a heck of a Brahms 4!,"Mr. Darcy's review is quite fair and complete. I don't agree that the sound is congested, though. It is true that Karajan's take on this symphony is muscular and aggressive, like his Brahms 1 (Brahms: Symphonie No. 1) from the same cycle. However, I think Brahms's music responds well to this approach - the first movement in particular carries rare power in this performance. The Berlin brass are truly second to none.I would not make this my first Brahms 4 - for that, Kleiber (Johannes Brahms: Symphony No. 4 in E minor, Op. 98 - Carlos Kleiber / Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra) is really the way to go. This is a good second recording, though - comparing this to Bernstein's VPO recording (Brahms: Symphony No. 4; Tragic Overture), they are vastly different, yet both wonderful. If you like your Brahms with bulging biceps, this is the one to get."
5,They are the top of the world!...,"It is gratifying to hear bands like these ... the truth, their sound is impressive and this simple contains my favorite subject ... they recommend ..."
4,Great product,"We got this instead of the Diaper Genie because we wanted something simple and easy to use-- no turning cranks-- and something that would still be usable after the baby's out of diapers. We love the Diaper Dekor! We bought 2 refill packs before my son was born. He's 13 months now, and I'm just now shopping for more.Another reviewer mentioned problems installing refills. We did have trouble the first time, but once we'd each done it once it was a breeze. Highly recommend this product, though right now it looks like Amazon is no longer stocking the refills. That means I have to go to an actual Babies R Us store, which I hate. So, if they no longer stock, that could be a serious strike against this product. (But they do still stock the Diaper Dekor +, so I'd get that instead.)"
1,do not buy this,too much dust come out.... i do not want to feed my baby with my dusty brest..... i will never buy avent product..... so much dissapointed
2,Too small,"Like several other reviewers had noted, these pads are way too small. They are absorbent, but small. I found they slipped around a lot and I ended up leaking. I plan to stick with the lansinoh."
5,I never had issues with this breast pad!,I never had any issues with particular brand. They worked well for me! The absorbed well and they didn't move around. No one saw them through my clothes either.
3,Glass inserts and wicks for oil lamps,"The glass inserts for the oil lamp containers were fine. I'm not thrilled with how long the wicks hold a flame and am researching to see what else is out there. A friend who is a potter made a small oil lamp for me which,once lit, will burn on and on until I extinguish it. This is not true of the wicks that came with the glass inserts."
3,oil lamp wicks,"These were bigger and bulkier than I expected. They do not the lamps I needed replacement wicks for. Because of the cost, it's not effective to return."
4,One of the best historical anime series,"The Heian arc of this series is one of the best I've seen. If only it had been produced in the era of widescreen HD. Maybe one day we'll see a feature version, a la Evangelion, but in the meantime this is the anime series to see. It really looks great and has a powerful story and memorable characters. I didn't like the modern era portion as well, but it's interesting to see how the two sets of characters are paralleled. I give the Heian arc five stars and the Tokyo arc three.BTW, this set DOES include 12 discs as stated in the Amazon description. Half the discs have extras, including somewhat academic discussions of the material. I found them interesting and well worth watching."
3,ok...,"hard to fit on 48SP wheels dang near impossible on 100spoke best on mags but very durible finish and they get so stuck i gotta use them rubber ""powertool"" things of my moms to get them off and i am NOT week im 15"
5,Nice for those long trips,"I have back problems and sleeping on the ground without some type of padding is not a good thing. I found this to be the perfect item to take care of that. It holds air fine and inflates with ease. If you want it a little firmer, just blow some additional air into it. The material on the outside is relatively soft considering what this is meant to do. I use it with a lightweight sleeping bag and am comfortable the entire night. I do find that it is a little narrow, but that allows you to use it almost anywhere. I recommend this for anyone that wants a lightweight mattress."
1,This Book Really Sucked,"This might have been ground breaking stuff during the cold war, sure isnt now.I thought i bought Tappan On Survival and NOTTappan On Survival Guns.... His view on guns is screwed up also, if you like readingGuns & Ammo (1-year auto-renewal).... which Tappan wrote for.... by the way Guns&Ammo; sucks!..... you'll love this book. When he is talking about guns, he never mentions the AK47, go figure huh?If your thinking about buying a survival book, check out my other reviews, and stay away from this book! Check outRagnar Benson, thats a good place to start!Very unhappy i bought this book and that doesnt happen very often!"
4,Tappan on Survival,"A reprint of an old book purchased for my personal collection. Although the suppliers details listed in the book are no longer relevent the thought processes, theory and practical demonstrations are sound......I'm sure that there are more than few readers who will still feel the same about the Colt 1911 favoured by the author.""An oldie, but a goodie!"""
4,Precioso,"Hermosa reedición de un cuadernillo de poemas relacionados con las letras del alfabeto. Merecería una encuadernación más cuidada. Los dibujos de Edmund Dulac son sensacionales, como siempre."
1,soy medical mislabelled & sent the wrong product,"Beware! Soy Medical & Amazon sent me a different product than advertised. I ordered Kendall wet-pruf tape for its ability to create a waterproof barrier for wound dressings... I received a different Kendall tape that is not waterproof. It came in a plastic bag marked ""wet-pruf waterproof tape""... The core of the roll of tape looked different from the photo (blue instead of red... Nothing said wet-pruf)... So I tested the tape... Definitely NOT WATERPROOF!"
2,Not Color Fast - Watch Out!,"I ordered these and the matching tablecloth because I loved the dark royal blue color. However, the first time they were washed, ALL of the color washed out..and onto everything else in the load. Now they are a pastel blue. I wouldn't have purchased them if I had know this."
5,Prenatal Educational Tool,"""Our nursing department is using this book in their prenatal education courses. This book supports our young girls in our treatment programs, giving them hope and the potential to grow.""Sister Mary Rosaria, Administrator,Good Shepherd Center/ Baltimore, Maryland"
3,FAIR,"For those of you that love cryptozoology-don't buy this book.This book is mainly for those that have a passing interest in this type of subject.The entire book is written from a skeptics point of view as well.Book is fine for kids but if you're into Heuvelmans,Sanderson,Coleman,etc.-prepare to disappoint yourself."
3,Operations Management: Contemporary Concepts and Cases,"This text book got 3 rating. This is good text book that did a good job of covering this material. It would have gotten a higher rating if the definitions were captured differently. It is meant by captured differently, if the definitions were captured in a side box it would have better served me. The text gave very good examples of each concept but if the definitions were in an outside box it would have been better. The case studies were very informative and gave a good overview of each."
4,Pretty good choice,"The condition is good and the time to be delivered was just like promised before, in fact, the seller replied my email each time i asked question like is this really book that i want, ISBN, the year, edition and so forth.Nice choice after all."
2,This is ok but I think better!,I think better. This should be Nintendo Anniversary Advanced. I think Atari is fun reaaly fun but it would be better if they could come up with a NES one. I miss playing Atari and NES. I think Atari and NES games have some nice music.
3,Ehhh.....,"Well, I have seen better! In my opinion, it is too true to the 15 year old versions...thought they might spice things up a bit! BLAH"
2,Tide Function not for Gulf Coast,"My wife bought this for me for Father's Day. I intended to use it while fishing along the Texas coat. I tried to sync the tides, but I never could get it to come out right. I finally checked the manual, and it says that the tides are 6 hours, 12.5 minutes apart. Not here! Maybe the ocean tides, but not the Galveston tides. We are going to return it, I am very disappointed. I am sure the other features of the watch are great like any other Timex, but I wanted it for the tide function."
2,"Soak up, but don't absorb","I went through an entire box in two days! The fill with milk in no time and have to be changed constantly. Plus, the diameter of these are much smaller than any others. Try Gerber or Lansinoh."
1,Don't let the price sell you!!,"I bought these pads for my last pregnancy and I wish that I never did. They would always fall out my clothes whenever I would breastfeed or even go to the rest room. They wouldn't stick like they were supposed to, I guest because I have big breast. They didn't absorb like they are supposed to either. I would wear 4 pads at a time and had to change them every 45 mins. I was always changing my shirt and bra because I would leak right through them. They were very bulky as well. Just wearing one pad would show through your clothes and not look cute, imagine how wearing 4 looked. I would never again buy this item, nor will I recommend this item to anyone. Don't let the price sell you!!"
2,Will not buy again,"These are thicker than Lansinoh Utra thin, also thery are smaller in diameter..This makes them visible from cloths.. It has a very small sticker, which comes off easily."
4,Avent Nursing pads,Overall These Avent Nursing pads work well. They absorb a lot and are a good size. They breathe better than others I have tried. The only dislikes I have with them is they are a little scratchy when you first put them in; at night when I am sleeping they shift a bit (Most of the time its not a problem); and they can be seen when wearing light colored t-shirts.For the price I would definitely buy them again.
1,Absolutely horrible!,"These nursing pads are awful! They are tiny and thick, and they bunch up inside your bra. The adhesive strip is terrible, too, so they end up migrating or falling out when you go to nurse your baby. It also sucks that they're not individually wrapped, so not great if you want to throw a few in the diaper bag. Lansinoh is WAY better, and I'll be going back to those for sure."
2,No fragrance apparently does not mean no scent,"This product does have a strong fatty, waxy, sort of plastic-like odor to it when it first comes out of the container. A little like the scent of Crisco, but much stronger. I do not find it particularly pleasant.The odor seems to fade after a minute or two, and a have to admit it is a fairly effective moisturizer.However, I definitely would not have bought it if I had smelled it first. And I will not buy it again."
5,ASHES OF THE ELEMENTS,"THE ALYS CLARE SERIES OF HAWKENEYE MEDIEVAL MYSTERIES CONTINUES TO IMPROVE. ONE LEADS TO ANOTHER, BUT CAN EASILY BE READ ON IT'S OWN. THE LIFE OF AN ABBESS AND HER NUNS AND MONKS WAS NEW TO ME AND FASCINATING. I'VE ORDERED THE NEW ONE. HER MALE CHARACTERS ARE AS WELL DRAWN AS THE WOMEN. THE HISTORY INVOLVED IS ANOTHER PLUS FOR THIS SERIES."
2,mediocre songs & bland sounding production,"As a big fan of Don Edwards albums but not of Marty Robbins or his songs I'm not qualified to say how well Don and the producer achieved their goals. All I can say is I was uninspired by every cut on the album. The song structures seemed too meandering and /or lacked dynamics and musical interest. Plus the arrangements and the sound seemed just too smooth, slick and one dimensional. Maybe in the right mood or as background music I might have found it OK. So I suggest anyone like me try before you buy this particular Don Edwards effort."
3,somewhat disappointing,"I have another one of Rosie Ledet's cds--It's a Groove Thing!--which I liked enough to order another. Sweet Brown Sugar was definitely not as good. While lyrics are not Rosie's strong point, they were even weaker on this cd, very basic and redundant. Someone get this woman a thesaurus! I'd recommend It's a Groove Thing over Sweet Brown Sugar any day!"
3,Blah,Ok so these arent horrible but way too rich. The chicken is like kitchen cafeteria type meat and then cheese on top. My parents liked them but I wont be finishing the rest of the pack. Buy some frozen ones at the store they are better.
3,Gets The Job Done...But...,"I prefer to use Cirepil wax and their cans WILL NOT fit inside the warmer. Cirepil is 14.1 oz, and that .1 makes a HUGE difference. Just be sure your cans are 14 oz even or it won't fit. I had to melt down my hard wax in another warmer and pour it directly into this warmer. I'll have to start buying the beads to add in and melt down when I get low on wax. For the price, it's great...but I am now stuck with only one brand of hard wax that I can ever use in this warmer...which is ok since it's my favorite, but if you were looking for one to hold cans you have to be sure they are 14 oz or you will be using one type of wax in it forever."
1,run away,"If you've read Davies' wonderful thrillers -- Nest of Vipers, Wilderness of Mirrors, Into the Fire -- and are hoping for more of that here, run away. Run fast. This is a romance/chic lit mess. Entirely narrated in the first person (there is almost no dialogue) the book hits new lows, even for the genre of stupid women making bad choices.Here's hoping Davies goes back to writing action adventures with strong, smart women. Perhaps this was written by her evil twin?"
2,Not very instructive,"I found this book to be very disappointing. With a title like ""Making Origninal portrait Dolls in Cernit"" one would expect a bit more instruction. Amounts of Cernit needed for the project would be very helpful...but this info is lacking as is much more about working with this polymer clay. What is not lacking is a complete history of Rotraut Schrott doll making endeavors, her inspiration, her abilites and where they came from. This book is a sad disappointment. Not recommended for those who truely would like to learn how to work with Cernit in dollmaking. Lot's of pretty doll pictures though......"
1,Blade and cutter,I ordered the wrong product. I have a very old razor and parts seem unavailable. I returned it and got a refund for everything but the shipping.
4,Great new Resource !,"Unlike the Smith Bible Dictionary, the Holman is in color and are real pictures and not drawings. This is a plus in many ways, but Smith's did have some good drawings (of fish for example) that the Holman does not have an equivalent. The maps and reconstruction models are top notch. The articles are for the most part very good. There are some interpretive problems for example when the writer of the article on Paul goes into Paul's theology, he is at points reading anachronistically. Also, in the article on Palestine written by Timothy Trammel, he fails to give a history on how the land came to be called Palestine on the maps. The introductions are good and useful and the stuff on Jerusalem, the Temple, pottery, Spiritual Gifts, the Jewish festivals, death, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and many more besides are top notch. By all means get this book, it is worth it."
5,Holman Bible Dictionary,This illustrated bible dictionary is fantastic. I just started seriously reading and attempting to understand the bible and this is so helpfu. It is chockfull of information on EVERYTHING! It allows me to learn in an interesting- not boring- manner.
2,Kindle Buyers Beware,"I have the Holman Bible Dictionary on my computer and it is fantastic, but on my Kindle it is bad news. You can't get to the information, the information is there. The alphabet index works about 25% of the letters and then only to the first item. The information is there but you can't get to it quickly. They have to make improvemnets before it is any value to a Kindle. My first bad purchase. Don"
1,Not for Kindle!,Do NOT buy the Kindle version - the search does not work and it is too large to page through. I will return the Kindle version. I am very disappointed that Amazon even offers a dictionary in which you cannot search.
3,A useful traveling companion,"I took this book with me on a recent trip to Japan and found it both endlessly fascinating and surprozingly useful in understanding the little dance our hosts did when making introductions, the subtleties of negotiations about seating and a host of other behaviors that were curious to American eyes."
4,HELPFUL!,We are training for our first marathon and wanted something that was easy to understand but could begin to incorporate right away. WELL worth it.
1,good if you know nothing about food v training and are completely noivce to both areas.,"So short and to the point,This ro&#65533;k was a huge disappoinment after reading the reviews.If your novice to running or fitness in general and over weight then this book would be a very good aid to you. I got it under the opinion that I would find out some examples of the foods that would give me the best out come in my up and coming marathon. However this book is filled with recipes and little anecdotes from people like "" i used to not eat breakfast but now i do and i actually have lost weight""!!And it has literally step by step idiot proof sections on how to boil veg. I skimmed thought most chapters and in the end realised that it was totally the wrong choice for me. Youd be better of subscribing to fitness or running times etc.very very disappointing and definitly not for experienced runners."
2,Author gives a ***** to himself !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I found the practice of the author giving a 5 stars to his own book very bad. She entered the comment as herself therefore my 2* instead of one only for at least this honesty.Book might be good but I do not see why she would get a 5* average becasue of her own vote. It even makes me thing about the validity of the other one although it might be valid.
1,*yawn*,"Absolutely nothing new here. And some points that made my eyebrows go up, to say the least. Also, my copy had editorial problems in the Vitamins and Supplements section. I've written to the editor to see if he'll send me a complete copy (I had paragraphs of text just missing).But in terms of content, it was just old and tired and dull. The book itself was a tough read and the tone, overall, was as if Clark were writing to the average walker trying to finish her first marathon.There's nothing here you can't find at Runner's World or a million other magazines/web sites. And I tend to think you can do better elsewhere.I would not recommend it."
3,"Ok, but could have been so much better!!","I rate this game 3 stars. It is ok, but could have been so much better. Sure the trucks are up to date but it is a little off of what the real life thing is. The game is about monster trucks. I thought they would have like freestyle and races but no they don't. After I bought it I wish I hadn't. No where near what I thought it would be. The graphics are very poor too. I think the developers were trying to make this into a twisted metal game with all of the firearms on the trucks. Unfortuneately if they ever come out with another game I will not buy it. I might rent it to try it but I wouldn't buy it first. I have already made that mistake once. I do not think this game is worth [$]."
3,old school,"Let me start by saying to remember, this is a sega genesis game. That being said, if you're looking for a game in which you can take a favorite player and make him the best player in the NBA, this is a great one for you. Once figured out, the game obviously favors the use of the Small Forward position, however, there are different plays to run, which get other players involved as well. I don't think you can trade at all. The graphics are pretty bad in comparison to newer games. And the computer difficulty is ridiculously easy as well. If buying this game, I recommend playing with a friend. It can cause for some fun, high scoring games. I gave it 3 stars b/c for some, this game will suck and they won't get past that. For others, the game is old, and sweet, and great to remember what we thought was awesome back in the good ole sega genesis days."
1,A Poor Design,"Luckily I was able to return this case at a local retailer with no fuss...they already had many complaints about the case and no longer stock it. When closing the case the Palm can turn on (including the backlight) and stay on, which drains the battery. After losing battery power several times in a month I realized that this case is just not worth it."
4,m515 Hard Case,"An excellent case for the M515 with a few exceptions.1. Can not Hot Sync until the case is removed.2. The included syluii (2) are hard to find in retail/Internet to replace, if they are lost or broken.3. Stylus has a tendency to slide out of the device and get lost.The best part of the case is its capability to fold back on itself. This makes it easier to use the device while installed in the case.Weakest Point: Lack of availibility of replacement stylii."
3,Seams tore after a half dozen or so uses,"Bought to use for theme parks knowing I would be the responsible party for carrying water, food, cameras, souvenirs, and whatnot. Small enough to not be a huge burden but large enough to accommodate a jacket or two plus the above mentioned stuff. Used about a dozen times in the last year and after maybe 6 or so uses the seams started to come apart. I fixed this with a quick reinforcement with my sewing machine and it is still being used whenever I need it. I'd buy it again for the price just don't expect it to last very long without some sewing."
1,too small for school kids...,this bag is not as good as it looks in the picture. it is too small for school kids. not satisfied.....
4,Great product,This is a great product. They are really easy to load and use in the Diaper Dekor Plus. The reason I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish the sack changed color or had a color stripe when you are nearing the last one or two uses so that you know it's almost time to refill.
4,Functional,"The Diaper Dekor refill 3 pack is convenient and certainly saves space on the shelves.The system works quite well, although our experience was that we had to change or ""cut"" the bag at least once per day. Fortunately, this system works by pulling the plastic refill material down, cutting, and then tying a knot at the bottom to form a bag. The result is that you really don't waste a lot of plastic when throwing away your dirty diapers.I'd recommend the disposal system and the refill bags to any new parents for its convenience and function with the caveat that the first refill change may be a little confusing."
2,Not well made,"I have had the Diaper Dekor system for over a year now. It was great for the first six months then the door came loose because the construction of the product is not very sturdy. I also found that it also allowed odors to escape easily. If I were to go back in time. I would not buy the system again. The only good points are that the system is easy to use and refill, otherwise the construction is cheaply put together."
5,Vivid colors and very inventive,Great book to introduce children to ways you can be creative. I liked that some of the pages were cutouts- for example one was the shape of a glove and that the pages were different sizes. The print was large/simple to help beginning readers and the page texture easy to help with fine motor skills in page turning. Overall it is just a fun book to look at.
4,Will buy another,"I have owned various indoor grills but this one is the best I have found so far. I would not even consider a George Forman because of the front drip tray (it dosen't attach and is a safty hazard). I have cooked everything from burgers,steak, chicken and pork. I like it best for chicken. The grills are easy to clean as is the rest of the unit. I will buy another one when this one wears out."
3,Ok tent,"This is a decent tent. It's big enough for both my son and I to get in. I bought this particular one because I thought I could hook up our existing tunnel to it since they are the same brand. Unfortunately, they didn't fit together for some reason. I like the fact that it's easy to fold up and slide behind a big peice of furniture if you want it out of the way."
2,Great Fun - But Broken Just A Month Later,"I loved this tent, and so did my kids. I gave it to my three year old for Christmas. Just a month later though, it is broken. We had friends over yesterday and the kids moved the tent for more play room. An inside beam snapped. I've tried taping it etc.. but to no avail. My kids are very dissapointed, and so am I. It WAS their favorite toy from the holidays. This item was a lot of fun while it lasted.I tried to contact Pacific Play Tents, but could not find their official site."
1,Camping,"This tent is not to be camped in. I went camping in the Appalachians in this, and it does not keep you warm whatsoever. The bottom soaked in water when it rained. Also, it doesnt even come with a tarp for the top, so when it rains,you are in trouble. Worst camping experience of my life!I am definetly buingHaba Play Tent Caro-Linifor my trip to the Swiss Alps next month!"
1,specs online don't make sense,i considered buying this but the dimensions online for it just don't make sense:# Product Dimensions: 17 x 17 x 3 inches ; 7 pounds# Shipping Weight: 4.1 pounds (View shipping rates and policies)17 inches by 17 inches by 3 inches???And it weighs 7 pounds but when shipped it's only 4.1 pounds???
4,Good Quality and Construction,"After returning two very cheap play tents from Target and Kmart, I finally found this one. It is of good quality and durable. Simple to set up. I recommend it."
4,grandkids love it,We bought this for the grandkids for christmas. they love it. it was easy to assemble and is a good size.
1,waste of time,"Total waste of time. The characters are contrived, shallow and affected, the plot boring and predictable"
2,very narrow and short,"I was disappointed at how narrow and short this shoe was. I usually wear an 8-8.5Narrow but could only find the 8.5Medium and decided to get it and wear heavier socks. The 8.5M was narrow, especially in the toe box, and the length felt more like an 8 than an 8.5. Returned them and resented having to pay the return shipping. These shoes aren't made to fit the advertised size."
3,"Fila Women's F-13 Sneaker, Triple White, 7M Review","My foot got bigger as time went on and I outgrew this shoe and I wear a size 8 rather than a size 7. But I thought that these sneakers were just okay, nothing spectacular about them."
4,Evil and funny!,"While you read this screenplay, you'll regret laughing at such a sad and tortured little girl. But then you'll say ""Oh, what the hell..."" and laugh some more. This is a comedy, and it's supposed to make you laugh. For people who like black comedies."
2,Best of the 3.5 books,"This happens to be the best of the 3.5 core books. Unfortunately, this isn't saying much. Wait for official errata and/or a 2nd printing."
4,"Nice Book, Great Pictures","My knowledge of the Dungeons & Dragons universe is limited. I've never played the role playing version, just the video game incarnations. So my liking of this book has nothing to do with Dungeons & Dragons itself.I just love looking at the illustrations and reading about the monster statistics. Almost every creature has it's own painted image to view, complete with description of strengths, weaknesses and special abilities. The only thing more impressive than the creature designs is the sheer number of them; about 420 in all! I can't say much about how the rules portion or monster stats affect the game play. I only know the artwork is wonderfully done. It's clear the book's content was given a great deal of thought.The pages are made of a nice, smooth paper. The cover is solid with a semi-glossy finish. The overall quality of the Monster Manual III v3.5 is enough to compel me to begin collecting more D&D; rulebooks."
4,Great fun,"I played a little D&D when young, but had a blast playing ""nerd poker"" in university. Having both played and DM'd, this book is a great resource and entertaining read"
4,"Episode 38, clearing up","The missing ""Choreographed Party Political Broadcast"" in show #38 was not A&E;'s doing. It's been reported that a tech at either Time-Life (the original syndicators) or the BBC had accidentally erased this sketch once it had shown here in the mid-to-late 70s. The omission of the BBC comedies preview, however, is another case.There is a glimmer of hope. BBC America will start running Python beginning in a 10-hour marathon on May 26th, and there is word that a new ""Megaset"" DVD with previously left-out material may be coming."
5,Magical,"Pierson is wonderful at explaining the magic of motorcycling in a way that could only be called eloquent. For so many motorcyclists, the two wheeled vehicles consume our lives. Pierson dynamically describes the path of her life as it coincides and included motorcycles while she informes the reader of some of the best motorcycle specific data. I simply could not put the book down and have returned to it many times. If you are passionate about motorcycles, do not miss the chance to read this work."
2,The Imperfect Book,"I borrowed ""The Perfect Vehicle"" from the Roanoke, Texas, Public Library. I spent four days reading it, and I read the whole book mainly from an obsession about finishing what I start. The book is a disorganized collection of personal experiences, observations, motorcycle factoids, sweeping generalizations and maddening qualifiers, with no obvious connection or point. As a sometime aspiring writer and owner of a million unrealized ideas, I applaud Melissa Pierson for having completed her project. She can write descriptive prose, and she has done a fair amount of research. I like the cover art and the book feels good in the hand. Robert Pirsig inspired me with his ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,"" by weaving multiple layers of meaning into a coherent whole. Pierson has also made me want to write, because I feel that I can do better.That feeling will pass, but for me, ""The Perfect Vehicle"" does not."
3,Just Ride it,"The book was an interesting read, however, Melissa needs to quit attending those rallies (which she has shared bad karma and mixed emotions with the reader) and just RIDE."
2,This girl thinks too much,"The title and cover page of this book provided a great deal of promise, unfortunately the contents delivered very little pleasure. Pierson waxes on way too much on the philosophy of life as opposed to just riding motorcycles for the love of them - like the rest of us. The book drifts from the history of motorcycles to the complicated woes of her own personal life; two trains of thought that she trys to run parrallel throughout the book but fails. Sorry, I could only reccomend that you pass on this one."
3,a little anoyning,this game is okay. the only problem is that theres this anoyning guy. he keeps saying i bet you cant hit that. he keeps saying that in each level. man thats anoyning. spiderman the movie game was much better than this. way better. if there going to have star wars 3 just dont put that anoyning guy in there.
1,SLAVE 1!,I REALLY want to unlock the slave 1 and if someone could just write a review showing a few of the secret objectives that would be awesome.
1,Seriously doubt Christine Monson wrote this book...,"...It is terrible. It is so unlike any of her other novels. The book and characters are so formulaic, ...I cannont believe that she wrote this.I highly recommend any and all of her other titles. Most especially Stormfire and Surrender the Night. Ms. Monson is an exceptional storyteller. An incredibly gifted romance/adventure writer. This effort, however, is awful. The characters are underdeveloped and their conversations redundant. Too many ""convenient"" and trite occurances take place to advance the story-line. Yuk!"
1,Impenetrable,"I don't understand those who gave this terrible book a 5 star review. The information no doubt is in there, but the language and presentation of the information are very poor. It's almost as if the authors had set out to provide the most arcane presentation possible, so that only the elect could understand it. In my view this is not an introductory book; neither is it a good text book. I confess to finishing my unit in radio astronomy by using this book as little as possible - and I'm not alone in that."
1,Flimsy,If you have an adult cat you'll find this too lightweight for use. Spend more and get something made to last...
2,Marvin Gaye,I love Marvin Gaye but this album falls way short. I am not a music officianado so perhaps my lack of expertise is to blame. I wanted more of his fabulous voice and not so much instrumentals.
3,Nice concept but really flimsy,"I was hoping to use these to hang curtains to match the curve of an arched door, but the coil is made out of a thin wire and there's no way to control how it curves. It ended up creating a sharp bend in the middle of the rod so I scrapped the idea altogether. Also I don't think these would support anything more than really thin fabric, which may be alright if that's what you're going for."
2,Disappointing,"I just picked up this game yesterday, and I've gone through about nine of the twenty(?) levels. This is not what I expected. I loved Crash on the Playstation, but on the Playstation the games had good graphics and sound. On the GBA the graphics are blocky--I don't know why they couldn't do better; look at Rayman Advance, which is gorgeous. The sound is tinny. Apart from the flying and running-toward-the-camera levels this is strictly 2-D, mostly side-scrolling. If you're moving on a side-scrolling path, you can't move up or down on the path--just left or right. (You thought Crash on PSX was ""on rails""? This one is REALLY on a rail.) Design is unimaginative, with less variety than the PSX games. I wish I hadn't bought this."
1,A Travesty!,"This book is a travesty! It claims to cover guns of the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, but it is nearly devoid of useful information regarding handguns produced prior to 1970!. For example, there is no entry at all under Luger or DMW! Ironically, although there are a few late model Lugers in the Mauser entry, don't expect any useful information about broomhandle Mausers. What mention there is of historical pieces is so spotty as to be extremely frustrating. While there are a few old colt revolvers mentioned, there are no entries on the pre-1911, auto-loading Colt pistols. Did Savage ever make a handgun? Must be they never did, there is no such entry in this ""comprehensive encyclopedia"". To think, I bought it because wanted information on pinfire revolvers of the 19th century! This book is a huge disappointment."
1,Christmas Disaster,This was to be a gift for my daughter. It arrived carefully packaged in many layers of fitted cardboard but when it was opened we discovered it had been shipped broken: the pitcher had pieces of the plate inside it although the plate was underneath a separate layer of cardboard. I tried to reorder but was told they had no more inventory. Amazon immediately refunded my money - no complaints with them.
4,It is a fun simple read!,"I will not go over the plot since it is covered rather well.This book is a fun fluff type read! Max does a great job at creating good characters! The evil power hungry capitalist, the strong female hero who seeks good or is it revenge?, the poor dumb shmuck with a brilliant psycho girl friend, the looser who gets caught up in things.Each character gets his end! Most fitting is the end of the evil capitalist!Max has a wicked sense of humor and makes good use of it to poke fun at American business.Finally, the barcode tatoo on the cover does get explained in the book!"
3,Hardly biting satire...,"If you are looking for a scathing critique of Capitalism and globalization, keep looking...This book is a light, entertaining thriller. It can be read in a short amount of time without a lot of mental energy invested. If entertainment and escape is your thing, you won't be dissappointed.If you were looking for the promised political satire, you will be dissappointed. I guess I should have figured as much after reading that Hollywood was already optioning the book...hardly the stamp of controversy. If this is what ""social protest"" literature has come to, then things are even worse than they appear.Anyway, as light escapist novels go, it wasn't bad. Not great, but not bad. As political satire goes it was...well...light and escapist.I got suckered by the premise, which showed promise. Although that promise never came close to materializing, I ended up reading the whole thing in a couple hours and not throwing it against the wall, so I'm giving it three stars."
2,"Great Idea, Mediocre Execution","The ideas, characters, and plot are really good, but there just isn't enough detail/depth to the characters or the world to make it a good read. It reads more like a good action movie or bad graphic novel."
4,It is to laugh...,"Forget the overt, pretentious literary criticism of the previous reviews. Imagine a world in which George Dubya Bush, Wal Mart, and Nike actually win (not so hard, is it? You may already be living it.). Now, imagine trying to be a citizen within it. This is a very funny, serious book, from the initial premise (the insane globalisation that permeates everything, is accepted as normal, and everybody's last name is the company they work for), to the ribald, unbelievable, you wish you would do that if things were like that action that makes up the plot, this is a film waiting for a book deal. As it should be. Read it and laugh, and weep."
2,genric yawn.,This instructional lacks coaching and floats aimlessly to its end.Rockabilly has a lot of travis picking involved and the instructor ignores this important part only to offer up one of the lamest scotty moore lessons i have ever seen.I may have been spoiled by the Paul Pigat dvd's but this one was clearly a waste of money for me.
1,fraud!,oh my god! whay should i do? instead of the ck one fragance i received an adidas deodorant of 2 bucks$!!!
2,"Wait untill about version 3.0, as the game is full of bugs","Once you actually get to fight other ships, the game is a blast. Complicated, but learnable. You will spend time mastering stratagy and controls. Unfortunatly, the game crashes A LOT. As you progress through the campaighns, the time between battles stretches to 10 minutes, as the computer does ""something"" (800 mhz athalon is doing something, as the hard drive and CD aren't doing anything, and the graphics it is changing are minor). It will crash to the desktop with unacceptable frequency. You will reinstall it at least once. And, if you are like me, you will put up with this because the actual battles are visually awesome and really fun. Stratagy is challenging and not covered by any documentation real well (trial and error). I am playing with patch 2.0.0.4 and have read that othe patches are a LITTLE better, but none of them qualify as good. 3.0 will probably be playable."
3,quality not there,"This is my second carrier i purchased. This particular one is not a great quality. The bottom said it was sherpa cushion. It is only some cheap material covering a plastic bottom. I needed a larger carrier for my three large boys. This does have enough room, but the quality is not there at all. I bought a smaller Bergman and it is much, much better quality for the girls. I'm keeping this ONLY because the size is better for the boys. I will add some old towels when it is time for the vet visit to add comfort to the bottom. Not worth the money. Wish the other brand came in a larger size!!!"
5,blues the way it should be played,"I found Roosevelt ""Booba Barnes'"" Heartbroken Man to be a must have CD for all old school blues fans. His sound is a mix of Howlin' Wolf, Albert King and James Brown for good measure.Growing up in rural Mississippi, otherwise known as the home of the Delta Blues, he was familiar with all the other blues artist around at that time but decided to do something a little different! The tracks are funky and fresh with just the right mix of guitar and harmonica.Anyone who didn't get to see him perform missed out on a treat! Playing the guitar with his teeth was the highlight of the show for me!"
1,any direction?,"Howard ferstlers book is a collection of digital recordings. Unfortunately though howard doesn't pay any attention to the performance factor of the musicicans. He just states whether the the CD has good bass, bad bass high treble and the likes. I'm not sure whether this book is intended not for the music lover but the gear freak instead, but sadly I couldn't find anything here for the serious music enthusiast who is concerned with actual musical performance, and not how much thud and tizz a recording has. Basic, and banal."
3,Not Quite Seth,"Although I must be the biggest Seth fan on the planet, this book was somewhat of a dissappointment. It didnt satisfy my thirst for more information on quite possible the best actor of our time. Actually, I think that most of what was presented in this book was information I myself or any big fan could have told you. I would still reccomend it for a good.. relaxed read. If your looking to find out more about him this isnt the book for you."
2,WARNING: Ironing Board collapses during use!,"A nice product and fast shipping. But the darn thing collapses during ironing if you put more than about 15 pounds of pressure on it.Edited Feb. 2009: So we called the manufacturer about this problem, and they sent us out two more supporting brackets (it only came with one) and since then it has worked great.I have brought my rating up from a 2 to a 4 1/2 stars on this edited review."
4,as expected- good product,saves space... easier that putting a freestanding board up and down all the time.No directions Having never seen one of these- I didnt find it obvious.Also- only one leg has a cap on the foot. The other has nothing.still holding up well after a yer and a half.
1,Viastat was not effective for me,"Being a 73 year old male, I need some help. Viastat didn't do a thing, and unlike most companies that offer a trial usage, the company only refunded 2/3 of what I paid."
3,Satisfied but not delighted,"The gel pads and straps holding them snugly to the leg are fine, on the Nailers 60230 knee pads, but the rigid plastic outer shells make the knee pads uncomfortable when I wear them setting tile on floors. A rubber shellwould be a big improvement."
2,Compact design & poor firmware,The rio carbon is a slick and compact design that plays well but constantly locks up at the end of a playlist. Updates to firmware have not solved the problem. Don't waste your money on this.
1,Horrible Experience,"Volume wheel broke after 3 days. Company sent me a refurb in worse condition than the one I had sent. Company gave me the runaround for 3 months. Lying, saying that they would send me a brand new product, which apparently never became in stock with in 3 months. Do not purchase this product if you seek quality!"
2,Lousy service,"I returned my second RioCarbon after 3 months. It froze permently. I was promised a replacement within 10 days. It is now one month since I started the return process and still no replacment. For weeks they coud no find proof of delivery even though I had the proof in hand and gave them tracking numers. I called numerous times and was often on hold for 15 minutes, I was frequently escalated to higher ranking reps each whose compentency decreased as their title increased. I was promised two day deliverybut at last contact am getting 7 day delivery- maybe. I still do not have replacement in hand., I enjoyed the Rio Carbon when it worked. I actualy got 18 hours for my audible books. It is a handsome piece with a good screen. The service stinks. The quality is marginal. An IPOD for me next time. It would make a good fishing lure."
4,rio carbon review,i love it. the only thing i hate about it is that you cannot create play lists on the fly. other than that - it's great!
2,Doesn't Hold up!,"I bought one for my 15-year old and my brother bought one for himself. The wheel on both became dislodged, ours after about 95 days (or just a few days after the warranty expired)and the other after about 7 months. Trying to get an answer on how to get them repaired was impossible and after many hours online and several faxes to Rio, we gave up. Instead we bought earphones with volume adjusment and got by without the click-wheel navigation feature. After 8 months, one of the units was fell accidentally off a shelf and onto a hardwood floor and that was the end of that! Recommend you check the warranty and talk to others about their experiences B4 you decide which MP3 to buy."
1,0 stars - piece of *%$&,"I've probably used this thing for 10 minutes in all the time I've had it and spent hours trying to get it working.Don't bother wasting your money.First, it didn't power up at all. then, it powered up but the pc no longer recognized it. I finally got it all working AND charged up the battery, upgraded the firmware, etc. Unplugged it to listen to it and what do you know? None of the buttons are reponding. It looks like it's cycling through the songs but can't hear anything. Now it doesn't get recognized by the pc OR the power adaptor. Nice. Pushing the reset button does nothing.If you do buy this, make sure you start TRYING to use it right away so you can get your money back. I waited too long til the warranty was over.I spend my whole day dealing with computer problems. This was supposed to be a ""relaxation device"" for me!!!! :)Just posting this as a warning - take a look at all the people who have problems with this. I'm buying an Ipod."
1,"Don't waste your money, buy an IPOD","You know how everyone is comparing this, as well as all other mp3 players, to the apple IPOD? Well there is a reason. The Ipod offers features that the others can't fathom, and has the reliability and customer service that one expects when making a large purchase such as this.My Rio is fine, but when comparing it to the Ipod I was only dissapointed. I cannot get an FM transmitter, and the file organization is pathetic in comparison. The case is awkard, and I only have one choice for cases. And of course, the interface itself on it just is not up to par. The Ipod has obviously been refined time and time again, and they have a very polished product. The Rio Carbon may be a good item in a couple generations, but they have a long way to go. The battery life is the one advantage that it holds over the Ipod, and that is a nice feature.In short, if you are going to spend this much money, you might as well buy a quality product such as the Ipod."
1,Terrible,"If you're thinking of buying an MP3 player, you should probably ask yourself a question: Am I the type of person that forks over 200+ bucks for something that might not last me a week?The first Rio Carbon I bought lasted me four days. I got it replaced with another one and it lasted me less than 5 hours. Rio has done an awful job engineering this product.And my friends haven't had much luck w/ IPods (they die out after several months). This, of course, concerns me since companies are distrubting faulty products. If you're thinking of buying an MP3 player, please wait for the products to be improved. I sure learned my mistake about it."
1,Very good product with very short life...,Yes I mean it! The thing dead on me the first day I use it!!!!
1,Rio Carbon Player,My MP3 player arrived in a defective condition. It doesn't work correctly and I would like to return it.
1,Quality Control Issues With RIO PRODUCTS,"There is a history of Rio's that fail right after the short 90 day warranty period.The Carbon is no exception.I've gotten the dreaded 'Upgrader' Error Message and the unit will not work without the charger attached to the USB Port on the unit.I've tried everything, including updating firware apprx. 5 times with no success.Stick with Creative or Apple products. Their quality control is much better."
2,Rio- Good but cheap,"I have had a Rio Carbon for about 8 months. So far I've gone through two of them. I don't know whether I've gotten bad ones or what because the first one after about 2 months wouldn't do anything but display an ""Upgrader"" message and the second one's volume wheel became dislodged and doesn't work anymore. Now the company wants 100 bucks for another one. No one should have two go through two MP3 players or more.Thats why I think that it's JUNK.I'm now thinking about getting an iPod because they don't have external parts besides the headphones. The overall design is good and the storage and software is satisfactory but I mean come on... How many products are you supposed to get? Last time I checked it was 1."
2,Think 2ce b-4 buying,"Great little MP3 player when it works. Mine quit charging and I followed the online advice and pushed the reset button, now it doesn't work at all. I have been going round and round w/ the company because it is out of warranty. J&R; music only has a 30 day wqarranty on mail orders, so I'm screwed both ways.To make it better they need to have a case with a clip or something so that you don't have to hold while your working out or running. Also headphones do produce a lot of static. I'm sure some people have had great success w/ this thing and will keep it for a couple of years, but not me, mine has died after 90+ days. Maybee I can get it replaced, maybee not. At least I still have my CD players."
4,Reliving the night!,This is a great dvd. I was there the night this was recorded and it was like reliving the entire night. The sound quality was great and my friends even love watching this dvd with me. I got chills when I watched it. If you ever wondered what it would be like to see Frolic spin this gives you a great idea and makes you feel like you're actually there.
1,overrated,"I bought this with the belief that Bernzomatic has a better reputation than Magna. While it is much quieter than the MT245C, it also puts out considerably less heat. I don't believe their claim that it puts out 3x the heat of other torches, unless they are comparing it to a cigar lighting torch."
4,NENSHIN! GATTAI! GO AQUARION!,"Aquarion is a ""love it or hate it"" series. It's all up to the viewer, so I'll make this brief.It has a nice charm, and is really engaging. The visuals are absolutely gorgeious, and so is the music. Aquarion is directed by Shoji Kawamori, who did designs for Gundam and Transformers, and directed Macross (Or Robotech here) and Escaflowne.And the soundtrack is by Yoko Kanno who did the soundtrack for Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop and Turn A Gundam.Aquarion is a series NOT to be taken seriously, in order to enjoy Aquarion fully, it's best to treat it as a comedy and your typical 70s or 80s Super Robot Show. Also, please note there might be a few plot holes, but more than likely, it will be patched by the upcoming sequel (As of this review), Aquarion EVOL. So it's up to you, the view to decide whether to see it or not. Also, for 20$ the most, Aquarion is a pretty good bang for your buck."
5,check it out,I recommend that if you like mecha anime check out this anime.It has a good story line and the mecha looks wild.
1,mediocre,"It's entirely possible we would have enjoyed this if we had never seen Evangelion. It was blatantly copying many many elements of the Evangelion series. Unfortunately, I was only able to make it through the first two episodes before getting fed up with it."
3,Not as exciting as I thought,"Bought this thinking it might be good. Saw a very very short clip of the show which sparked my interest. The characters were interesting, but the battle scenes especially the ones in the beginning up to about halfway through the series was very repetitious, boring and lost my interest several times. Overall it was just ok. the interaction between the characters was more exciting."
2,Irish Tenors are Better,"I accidentally bought this CD because I thought it was ""The Irish Tenors"". I wish that I had bought theirs. The ballads in this CD are hollow, the music is lacking, and their voices lack conviction. ""Live From Belfast"", by the Irish Tenors, has these same songs in a deeper, truer tenor and I much prefer it. However, I give these guys props for having the guts to record an album, albeit a bad one."
5,I BOUGHT 4...,"A bought 4 of this for my entire family... It looks great, feels very comfortable and cheap. The style is unique too."
1,Don't waste your money,"These players are way too fragile. My first one lasted a week before it stopped working for no apparent reason. I returned it to Amazon and the replacement lasted 2 months before the FM tuner went out and the Volume down button quit on me. This player is a complete waste of time, money and life in general."
1,Don't waste your time,"I got a Forge for Christmas, returned it in 3 weeks because it turned itself off every time I touched the volume button. The second one turned off right after hooking it up to the computer to load it with music and never turned back on again. The third one got as far as playing it's first song and quite. In two months I gave 3 Rio Forges a run for their money and every one of them failed miserabley. I have since replaced it with anI-River that works great. Don't waste your time on the Rio Forge. Even the customer service department at Rio admits that the product has issues."
1,Doesn't work anymore,"Memory: I put in a 512M SD card and with the 128M internal, that's plenty for me.Playback: Good user interface, great sound, easy to use.Headphones: Sound great, stay in place, I don't even feel them while I'm mountainbiking.FM: Works great for me, I live about 20 miles outside Albuquerque, NMReliability: Terrible. I have had this unit for four weeks. While downloading music, it turned off. It will not turn back on.Customer Service: Worst I have ever seen. I called multiple times, they had me fax my receipt three times, I have emailed six times, and I still don't have an RMA number so I can return the unit. At this rate, the 90 day warranty will run out before I can return it. I'll probably just end up having to buy another MP3 player and I'll be out $120.Conclusion: I wouldn't wish this MP3 player on my worst enemies."
1,More like a disposable player.,"Bought this unit to replace a Rio S35 Sport model that had lasted about a year with heavy gym and travel use. The S35 was pretty durable, and a Rio replacement seemed like a good idea.But the Rio Forge Sport is a big drop-off in quality. Much flimsier. And, as many other reviewers have reported, almost any bump or nudge causes a total shut down. The problem gets worse as the battery strength declines, so you only get about half of the battery's actual value before the player becomes totally useless."
1,ditto the rest: It's a piece of junk,Same problem everyone else has. Except for me it worked for less than two hours before overheating and conking out. Tried plenty of different batteries and it just won't turn back on. Save your time and money and buy something else.
2,Toshiba D-R400 Tunerless 1080p Upconverting DivX Certified DVD Recorder,The playback picture brightness went bad after less than a year. Maybe I got a lemon. Unit was decent when it was operating.
1,A Rip Off!!!!,Ordered this item for Christmas from A company called Apc-Discs-Books. Boy was that A wrong move that I regretted doing. Product didn't work all I got was sound no picture. Then when I emailed seller they tried to say I was getting an attitude because I wanted A refund. So I contacted Amazon but that didn't help they acted like they didn't have much control over the matter even though I failed A claim. Lesson learned if something sounds too good to be true it parable is.
4,Ease of Use,"Works well with all our other products and features many tweaks from within the menus, lots of different hook ups front and back and the ability to carry HDMI, well worth it's price."
3,Good product but be warned!,"This is a good product but it wasn't ""in your face"" clear that you needed a cable box or dish to be able to record television programs. I just have regular cable with a HD digital tv so...no box. I realize it is called a ""tunerless"" recorder but it didn't dawn on me that a digital tv wasn't good enough. I have tried looking at places for external tv tuners and have turned up a big goose egg. So now I have just another dvd player."
5,Water Therapy Ankle Weights,These are perfect. You can remove part of the weights if too much for you or have the total 5 lb. on your ankle. Love it. It has helped me a lot.
5,FABULOUS SWIMMING ADDITION,"I've been a swimmer for decades. I added these ankle weights to everything I do in the water and now I can't imagine swimming without them. I was able to use them as packaged, full weights, right away (decades of swimming paying off). I use webbed gloves on my hands along with them. I've used these swimming the side stroke, breast stroke, crawl, underwater, swimming on my back, treading water doing leg lifts and even upright dancing in the shallow end to music. I use these in both deep and shallow water. I also do surface dives with them. I now feel strange swimming without them. I miss the resistance if I don't include these weights in my swim. If and when these give out, I will be buying a new set within hours. Two caveats: one, make sure these are snug on you as if they are loose they interfere with swimming; two, you must be a very strong swimmer to use these in deeper water. A weaker swimmer might panic with the added weight with disastrous results."
5,g gundam rocks,it is one of the only gundam series i like ive seen a couple of them and they were to melodramatic but g gundam was awsome ok so the fight seen were a little bit to much like dbz but it was still an excellent series and is recommend to any who likes gundam or an anime with action and romance g gundam will not dissapoint buy it now!
1,Wrong battery twice!,"They sent the wrong battery - SNN5717B (instead of SNN5717C) which did not work, I returned it, they again sent the wrong battery (SNN5717B) which did not work. I sent that battery back about two weeks ago and have heard nothing in return. I guess I am just out my $10.00. This is my 1st failed transaction through Amazon.Allan Dale"
1,too small to hold a flame,"I bought these to place in wine bottle tiki torches that I constructed. Im not sure whether it is due to being used outside, but with a full bottle of fluid and the wick soaked the flame is barely a flicker. Some go out after a few minutes. I went to building a wick holder from plumbing pipe and use the larger Tiki torch wicks with no problems. I would not recommend these. They look good, but do not function well at all in my experience."
1,Everything you can expect...,"...from a self-published book. Plowing through the poor punctuation, grammar and non-existent editing rewards you with a glimpse into one sad woman's life. Its amusement value is about one dollar at a garage sale.Try Today's Military Wife by Lydia Sloan Cline if you're looking for actual information about military life."
1,Pathetic,"As a military wife and as a former sailor I found this book to be an utter waste of time to have read. Hilary Martin is an immature kid who knows nothing of how the miltary or the real world works. I feel she is very dillusional in her opinions stated in her book, and feel all military wives should steer clear from this pathetic attempt in trying to tell military wives how it is. As soon as I finished reading it I promply through it into the trash where it belongs."
1,Very poor acting,"Boring movie, with very wooden actors.Give this one a pass over, it took me 3 separate viewings to get through the whole movie. The acting was so monotone it kept putting me to sleep.It would be nice if they could get some movies on DVD that deserve to be there.TobrukPlay DirtyRed Ball ExpressNone But the BraveJust to name a few."
3,I like Your Idea About Play Dirty,"Hey I like that idea about releasing Play Dirty, wheres it at????? I think that movie is awesome, of course it looses its punch after the first viewing but man what a great film for war film buffs. No clue about this movie with the Jackster but its never on TV so it must be pretty bad. Jack was just starting so you can't blame him."
5,Looks great,I have a collar from Lia Sophia that I love but I have sensitive skin and I can't wear it in the summer. This collar is a little wider than I imagined but it looks really good!
5,So good I give it 6 stars,"This warm, unsentimental, understated humorous book is about a stray cat who get's under his reluctant new owner's skin thereby improving both of their lives. It is a wonderful description of how the feline species manages to ingratiate itself and find its niche. This book wonderfully describes the way a cat bonds with and transforms the life of a loner or person living alone. The illustrations perfectly match the tone and subtle humor of the text, the story and its characters. The bright colors used in connection with the cat contrast with the mostly subdued earth tones depicting Mrs. Crump's everyday life.This is an intelligently written book on the subject of cats and their owners and will demonstrate to children not just the magic of having a pet, but also the love and responsibility having one requires.By the way, the Merlin in my pen name refers to the king of all the cats who are and have been in my life (and they are many)."
1,"This is not a ""Big Book""",This is not a Big Book. I'm not sure why it is advertised under the selection of oversized paperback children's books. It's a lot of money for a small paperback. Steer clear.
4,Overall a great DVD to buy,"""Black and Pink"" was one of my first purchases of a DVD online. I found this DVD to be an enjoyable experience. There are some well known compositions found here (Liszt 'La Campanella') as well as a few that are new to me (Chopin 'La Ci Darem La Mano'). Valentina Lisitsa is a great pianist, she consistently produces passionate interpretations and is always a treat to listen. The only downside to this collection is the duration, only approx 75 min."
3,It's pretty meh,"I love forever 21, and i usually have good luck with their stuff. The hat was the right price, but it is suuuper huge. I understand the bigness is part of the awesome of this hat, but the band is so loose it falls down on your head and ends up looking stupid."
5,2 year service plan,Don't know how I can rate something that I haven't used. But I will give it a 5. They sent the papers very fast.. I am hoping that when I would need them they will act as fast.
4,Service Plan,"I was skeptical about ordering a service plan, but it arrived within the said timeframe. I have not had to call in for any service as such."
3,"I cannot rate this item, because I have not need it yet.",I hope I don't have to use this Service plan. I got it for my Canon S2 IS.
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in the small flame that it has. From the descriptions I read I expected a lot more. It doesn't do what I bought it for, burning tall weeds along the banks of a creek."
4,Should do what I need doing..,I purchasedd this to start wood fired oven. Should do fine for starting the appliance.
4,Outdoor Torch Kit,"I used the Outdoor Torch Kit to melt old eyeglasses into silicate in Iran. That country recycles everything so while I traveled, I got that job to make some money so I could go on traveling. It uses a lot of BTU fuel. It has easy handling. Unfortunately I was using this near an exhaust pipe that eschewed methane gas from a nearby sewer plant and I was nearly blown to pieces.Be sure to know that there are no exterior leaking gases in the vicinity before you use it. Also, don't handle aerosol cans or have petrol on your clothes/skin. I saw a guy go up like a log who had petrol on his clothes/skin."
4,Good garden and yard aid,"I inherited this little jewel from my mother's estate. She had a lot of decorative rock landscaping,as I do, and it works well for killing weeds and burning leaves in an area that you do no not want to use weed killers and the like. I works well around borders and trees where you do not want to spray. Fuel consumption is fair and I feel it fills a niche for all of us who have yards that need a little more care by fire than by chemicals. A great tool!"
3,Okay but not great,I found it very confusing at times. I wasn't sure if the main character was a good guy or a bad guy.
3,Good player for the price,"If money is a primary concern, this player provides decent quality playback for the price. Otherwise, put the money toward a higher-end player with more storage and a bigger display.Pros: the price, the unit is small and easy to carryCons: the mode switch is cumbersome to use, and the operating manual is a downright farce, like it was written by a 14-year-old Chinese boy who had just learned English."
3,For a complete newbie this got me hooked,"I couldn't even begin to tell you what the rules of D&D are, let alone what hit points or how important consitution is to a character. My boyfriend actually has me hooked on this game, and I have to confess I really like it. My only points of concern are the henchman/sidekicks you get. You have very little control over them, as compared to ""Dungeone Siege"". ""Neverwinter Nights"" is a very wordy game. You need to talk to a variety of people in the game to ascertain what your next quest is etc. Its a very exciting game that you can truly play for hours on end, or until your neck is so stuff you need to get up and move around."
5,All The Fun of D&D Without the Dice,"This is straight up Dungeons and Dragons Third Edition in video game form. You can start up as a variety of characters, equip a bunch of different weapons and armor, and use different kinds of magic. You add different people to your party as the game progresses. The graphics are pretty good, although they don't stand up to today's standards. The voice acting is also sparse but there is plenty of text to read. The setting can also get kind of dull after awhile.So, why am I rating this so high? Because, the plotline is in my opinion, fantastic and engrossing. Also, if you can look past the graphics, the game is actually a lot of fun. At the time, the graphics were pretty darn good, so that's why I don't think it's fair to make comparisons to today. It plays just like D&D; on a computer and that's something I like.Pick it up if you can!"
4,Good game,"My son loves this game. I didn't get into it as much. I would reccomend morrowind (elder scrolls 3) over this game, at comparable computer system requirements."
2,"Good single Play, But No Multiplay",this is a pretty good game if you are the kind of person who likes to play by themselves. This game has no LAN multiplay capabilities unless you buy a CD for every person playing. Also the controls are a little awkward.
1,Worst. Game. Ever.,"Only get this game if several people you already know are getting it at the same time so that you can all play together. Finding well run, stable games to play in online is tough."
2,Boring game!!!,"I didnt try the multiplayer, but the single player is really really boring. Its very slow.. and dull. Its more like a BOOK, than a game. There is alot of reading to do. I played for about an hour, and I have no urge whatsoever to play it again. The graphics are very poor. It is alot like IceWind Dale, which I thought was equally boring. If you like action and most importantly: FUN, I would definately suggest Blizzard titles like Warcraft3 and Diablo2 instead."
3,Not really that great,"This game is fun to start, but not fun to finish... It's too much ""reading"" on the screen. Dungeon Siege is much funner."
3,Too complicated,"A great game if you have loads of time on your hands. Many RPG-ers like the complexities of this game, like setting everything yourself, including countless subdivisions of attributes and skills. I just find it annoying and taking time away from fighting monsters and searching for powerful weapons and magical items. If you are a true, hard-core RPG fanatic, you will love this game. If you like to play old-school RPGs like the Ultima and Might and Magic series, Neverwinter Nights may be a little too over-the-top."
3,Dissapointing,"After playing a couple of RPG games I got excited about the genre although I was a RTS fanatic. I got NWN, hoping that this heavily-hyped game was going to be the RPG that will keep me away from RTS for quite some time.The game though was a HUGE dissapointment. The story is interesting but I could not keep playing it after the first stages/missions. The game progresses very slow since you had opponents to kill. But the opponents were not the problem.The problem was the time needed to kill a single opponent. I could not face 2 opponents at the same time. I would be killed if I tried, even as a swordsman. Not only the game was slow and boring but also had bugs and some crashes. The game has good sounds and ok graphics.Eventually though this game is again an overhyped game which is not worth all the attention."
1,Bugs and more Bugs,"Bioware has already made 2 patches for this game. Yes it worked for my high end computer system but the graphics were choppy. Choppy enough to make the game more frustrating than fun. Besides game perfomance issues, there are also some in game bugs. Quests will become impossible to complete, unable to pick up items, friendly people attack and kill you without warning etc. You can read all about these nightmares at the publisher's website. Stay clear till they fix these. It was a good concept though."
3,Just another hack n' slash game basically,"I'm going to keep this short. Yes, Neverwinter Nights features the 3rd Edition D&D rules, it's got a great multiplayer and it comes with an awesome construction kit, however, in the end Neverwinter Nights, despite all the features, is still just a hack n' slash ""adventure"" game that plays more like an all out action title similiar to Diablo. In terms of single player, it can't compare to the likes of Baldurs Gate 2: Shadows of Amn. But as for the multiplayer, it's definently fun to get with a lot of people and hack up enemies together. But while the multiplayer can be quite fun, the game just doesn't have that D&D feel and it comes off more like a souped up Dungeon Siege. If your looking for a game similiar to Diablo, Dungeon Siege (etc), than look no further, because Neverwiner Nights is probably the best in it's class. It's absolutely huge and definently has a lot of multiplayer value. Just don't expect another Baldurs Gate."
3,This Game was fun but i suggest Morrowind,Ok.... i admit this game was fun but the D&D is a little too complicated for me. I'm one of those people that like to just pick and design a character then go out and kill every1 that is possible to kill. I would Suggest Morrowind if you have a good computer. Morrowind is alot more in depth and u get to do absolutly anything. If u have a slower or old comp this is definatly the game u want to get
1,Liberal Folk Boredom,"Weak left wing messages and dull musical content make this a totally worthless collection. Buy some uplifting real patriotic music instead. Try ""Patriotic Country - Various Artists"" from 2004...you'll feel better."
2,Not worth the discount you think you are getting,The adapter broke after only three months of use. Not worth the money.
2,Great set of songs but disappointing singing,"Like a couple of the other reviews, I was very disappointed with the singing, both from Dewey and Gerry. Dewey's improved during the concert though- he sounded nervous (?) on the first couple of songs. When Gerry started to sing on his first song ""You Can Do Magic"" I actually thought he was joking. But he was not! I have been a huge fan for over 30 years and I saw a concert with America two years ago that sounded much better than this. The included one hour interview was nice and gave some interesting insight. However I had trouble hearing/understanding what the Australian interviewer said, probably because of the fact that English is not my mother tongue.Overall impression is disappointment although the set of songs are great."
2,Disappointing,"I am generally a big fan of hidden object games, but this one disappointed me. The story line for this game is that you are a budding paparazzi photographer, and get sent out to capture pictures of celebrities, from a Britney Spears clone to the Loch Ness monster (yes, they use a very broad definition of celebrity). You catch the celebrity first by finding ""clues"" (hidden objects) that they've been in a location. Once you've finished that, you have to try and catch a shot of the celebrity as they dash across the screen. I preferred the photo-taking to the hidden object stuff, mainly because the hidden objects are either ridiculously easy, or terribly difficult. Overall, I prefer hidden object games where the objects are better assimilated into the picture, rather than a bunch of them plonked on top of a scene. There are so many hidden object games now, I recommend looking elsewhere."
3,ON THE PROWL,"One of two new AFTERDARK ORIGINALS, PROWL is far inferior to HUSK. While PROWL takes an innovative twist on vampirism it strikes out in most directions. The story has the expected gathering of sex-starved, partying youths who take up with an all-too friendly truck driver after their van breaks down. And for the millionth time, its the gals left to fend off the bloodsuckers.The most debilitating aspect of PROWL is the overly chaotic camera work which makes it almost impossible to figure out what's going on. And it's flat, abrupt finale is disappointing. The acting is acceptable but no one stands out.While better than some direct to DVD films, I had hoped PROWL would equal the excellence of HUSK but no such luck. Let's hope future ADO's are stronger."
1,Not worth your cash,"I just finished watching this on SYFY. It isn't worth money at all. Some other reviewers said it was about vampires, but this one reviewer said it was about birdlike creatures. That makes sense...I guess. I don't know what the creatures were but the story really was low budget. The camera kept shaking because the director thought that would increase the action or suspense. All that shaking just gave me a headache. Like After Dark's the Task, Prowl is one of those horror movies where I didn't care for any of the victims. When the killing starts, 3 of the 5 victims are killed within 10-15 minutes of each other. That kills the suspense and horror when the majority of the victims are killed so quickly. It was also obvious who was going to get killed too, further diluting suspense. It was too dark to see clearly, so I couldn't feel much horror because my eyes were trying to adjust to the darkness.If you have to see it then rent it for a cheap price. Not worth buying."
3,Everyone beats around the bush ...not me,"This film was really good.Despite it being a low budget film the main character is someone you instantly become intrigued by.The overall concept of the film was good however disappointing when we discover that these""flesh eaters"" talk.What couldve been a new ""The Descent (2005) "" failed.But overal its worth a watch. Overal i rate this product 3 stars for creativity & authentic originality."
2,Not to good,I wish I would have passed on this purchase. I really shouldn't have waisted the money. They bounce in a bad way almost every time.
1,Training Balls,Was disappointed to find out these are not compatible with the Franklin pitching machine that I had also purchased!!!!! Just assumed they would work with the machine since they are the same brand!!
4,Excellent,"...I got this DVD because I had never seen Dispatch concert footage. I had only listened to 'Bang, Bang' and 'Silent Steeples'. So, when I saw this DVD I was surprised to see that the three members move around the instruments a lot. The concert footage is awesome. Some great guitar solos I must say. This DVD also helps you learn about the background of the band. It explains their touring history, and their views on Napster. I love it. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is due to me not being familiar with a lot of the songs. I guess I just have to get used to it. The CD is good as well. A bunch of great tunes."
5,TS7000T Benzomatic self igniting torch,"I use this torch at my job daily and I would not ever consider any other propane / mapp gas torch. The flame adjustment keeps me from burning down the building accidentally and I can heat anything I touch to red hot in a few seconds. The swirl flame looks cool and does it's job as advertised. I own a TS4000 also but hardly ever use it anymore.Make sure to only use the ""FAT MAX"" MAPP gas bottles because they are very sturdy with a low profile, heavy bottom and they come with a green valve that lets you empty them to recycle the metal container. I have yet to have a Fat Max bottle tip over."
4,wannabe surfer,The graphics are sweet as hell and the tricks are great once you learn how to do it but it way to long to figure out how to stay up. But other than that the game is sweet
1,Vainglorious Dreck,"I found this in the bargain bin at a local supermarket chain several years ago. Out of curiosity, and the belief that any book, priced at $2, could hardly be a waste of money, I purchased it.I overpaid and doubt the contents to be fit for use as a birdcage liner.From cover to cover, the language of the book is so pompous, overblown, and affectedly ""high-brow"" that a thoughtful reader passes from nausea to outright irritation with the rapidity of a jet-assisted take off. His cloying excursions into himself, only add to the torment.Instead of expertly dissecting the psychology of everything that is martial, the author leaves one trying to martial the strength to endure one more padded paragraph of philosophical name-drops or ego-stroking Martian flapdoodle pouring forth from the High Priest Martian that is James Hillman.A true and total Dorothy Parker, ""Not a book to be tossed aside lightly..."" if ever there was one."
1,A terrible oversight,"I generally respect Hillman, but he has wildly misconstrued the nature of war. His basic failure is an utter lack of examining the gendered nature of warfare. In short: Men make war. Yes, there plenty of instances where women engage in war, but those are far and away the exception and not the rule. Both the leaders who build wars and the soldiers who fight them are almost exclusively male. This is a consistent fact across all cultures around the globe and throughout history. Broadly speaking, women simply do not make war. This single and glaring oversight immediately destroy's Hillman's hypothesis that war is somehow a universal human archetype."
5,"Love it or lump it, this book is powerful.","Boy, did I love Spike's book! Not only is she a wonderful writer, she's managed to write a story so compelling that we all either loved or hated it, her, and everything Spike-like.I thought it was an honest look at a life littered with bad choices, too much booze, and not much tenderness. I also thought it was a testament to the power of a mother's love for her son. Who among us could say, without reservation, that our families were above reproach? Who among us has completely avoided bad judgement or regret? She's put it all down for Henry and us in the pages of this book.Spike is a courageous truth teller. I can't wait to see what she comes up with next. I hope the lessons of her life augment lasting change and healing. Henry deserves it, and so does she"
5,A Must Read for Every Woman in America,Spike Gillespie speaks out for every woman who's ever been in love with the wrong man. Her courage and conviction to go on trying with love even after all of the pain she suffers should encourage us all to not give up hope. Plus she's a great friend of mine. :)
3,Love her or hate her. Don't ignore her.,"Notice how most of these reviews are either one star or five stars? Nothing much in between the two extremes? That'll tell you something right there.Spike Gillespie is not someone who leaves you feeling indifferent. She'll make you laugh, or make you mad, or make you sneer, or make you cheer. But you won't shrug your shoulders and walk away from it. And I guess that makes her a powerful writer.Because of what she does with this true story, I would love to see what she does with fiction. Hope she gives it a whirl."
1,Child abuse-pure and simple,"I couldn't take anything from this book because I was too busy worrying about Gillespie's child the whole time. It seems she is always either drunk, in bed with a stranger, or assuring herself that she is doing a great job as a mother. Her friends who help with her son seem very nice but I wonder if they don't secretly think she's a terrible mother.I wanted to like this book. I was excited to get started reading it. But her victim mentality (blaming everything on her father) and her lack of practical concern for her kid just made me nuts"
4,This book is great !,If you like books with sick and cancer related kids. I really enjoyed it. It showed how teenagers are still the same as a normal kid.
5,Are you ready skeeee-daddy?!?!,"BaBaBa BoooYa!!!! Ok, seriously though, this book is a must for new as well as seasoned investors. It is simple to follow and provides useful examples to follow. I recommend it to anyone slightly involved with or interested in trading."
4,Not exactly what I expected but offers good basic advice,"Watching Cramer's show on and off for a period of time, I was under the impression that it is more a position trading show than a long term investing show. This seems to be emphasized by the viewer call feature where specific stocks are commented on briefly by Jim. When I read the book, I expected more details on evaluating specific stocks to take what I would consider an intermediate term position in. What I found was general advice on how to save money, not to become poor, and allocating assets in my 401k. Moreover, many of the topics discussed are mostly a repetition of his book ""Real Money"", so there is no need to read both.While certainly as the back cover of the book says that Jim Cramer is the greatest public generator of excitement and knowledge on the market, I believe the front cover caption ""Get Rich, Stay Rich...."" is not an accurate reflection of the contents of this book."
5,get your wrists right!!,"if u think ur balling just b/c you got a nice job and expensive wheels or something, think again. u need to be INVESTING that green and setting yourself up for the future. jim cramer is my main man for investment advice, love the show, and this book is gr8 for going in deeper abt the ideas BEHIND the advice. show's fun, but if u want to be serious about ur $ and get that franck muller watch you've always wanted, it's time to get your study on and read this book is a good start. haven't read jim's other stuff, maybe that's just as good, but def a good place to begin! RE-UP!"
3,Is Cramer really any good?,"In evaluating his Charitable Trust against various indices or monkeys or random walks down Wall Street or dartboards, please consider these 3 points:(1) Cramer is unable to move in and out of stocks as he would without a show, because of CNBC and SEC restriction, which are very severe(2) He has around 30 stocks in his trust to average out as a weak winner rather than being the winner he was when he made his bones in the stock market--Being so restricted in his trading, being a weak winner is pretty good(3) Could you win if you did your homework and picked just 5 of his recommendations in his newsletter, 5 diversified stocks? If I had a million dollars in Mad Money, I would do it...You need this kind of money to trade as the real Cramer recommends"
4,excellent investment information,i have been watching his show on cnbc and purchased this book. It is loaded with good information on investing and recommendations on how and what to buy and what to look for.
3,A tad boring,I was let down by this DVD. It felt like 2 hours of repeated playback sessions...at times freddie's mouth mumbles while the music keeps playing and his voice is heard loud and clear. I know it's the videos and the directors fault but josh hartnett they should have done it a bit more creative.
1,A cruel hoax,"This book is padded to fill out 85 pages. There is no message here besides, ""See a doctor - try pills."" It suffers from the same lack of integrity as most books written by committee. The cover is beautiful. The title is enticing. It's a marketer's ploy for praying on depressed people and their spouses, reaching out in hope. It's the first book I'm actually sending back to Amazon.com."
1,nope,this kind of metal died for a reason. how does one band play in the same key for the whole CD? drumming isn't tight enough on this CD.
4,Just didn't fall for Luke,"I really enjoyed this book. I loved the setting and all the details of the spanish culture. I also loved her descriptions of love being like electricity. Cassy is a very real character and very easy to identify with. Overall a very creative, interesting book. BUT, for some reason I didn't fall for Luke. I don't feel like I really got to know him in this book and he seemed kind of dull and removed. Also, it took me a while to really get into it....like the first 100 pages. The great story and all the twists though, still make it worth reading."
2,Decided to sell it after about 2 races,"I just didn't like the game. I bought it on impulse, without realizing that the perspective wasn't 3D (I was expecting the ""drivers perspective"" view). And I didn't even enjoy playing it from the isometric/""above"" view (which I loved the old Nintendo RC Pro/Am racing, by the way).This might be the game for some people, but not for me. Check out the screen shots before purchasing!"
5,Great job Scott.......:o),"The (Ultimate) resource for the Basic Stamp enthusiast. Scott has done a fantastic job with this book. Clear and concise coverage of everything from A-Z for the Basic Stamp. Outstanding code examples,schematics and projects. Scott goes well beyond the Basic Stamp to cover some necessary basic electronics fundamentals as well. If you use the Basic Stamp I or II, you will want this book. ""Most Highly Recommended""."
3,It was OK,"John is my boy in all, but I think this could have been alot better coming from one of the best dam comedians. I did expect alot more from it. Maybe I need to watch again when im in a more laughing mood but this one didnt do much as I thought it would do. John you still my boy. BANG BANG BANG!"
4,Finally,Man he finally dropped a stand up dvd. I was so glad when i tracked this down. it was way funny as I expected. John is a classic and I was so glad they decidded to drop this one.
4,Didn't Last,"Although I really like this knife block... it effectively stored 2 different sets of chef's knives, after 3 years of use, the seams split and it is now useless.Happened spontaneously at night. No new additions. It just split open at the seams.If I purchase a replacement, I may wrap it with strapping tape before using it."
2,Not so Great After All,"We had this block for about a year now and loved it. This block kept the knives really sharp. Well, we have a lot of large knives too and they keep falling out! In fact, almost daily we have a knife or two falling out and we have young children. So, suffice it to say .... we are in the market for a new knife block before one of us gets hurt with this one..."
2,no to dishwasher,"So it says it is dishwasher safe, but after running it through dishwasher, it seemed to have grown in width, and when we attempted to reinsert it in the wooden block, it cracked the block on two sides, making it now worthless. Darn. If I had not read that it was safe to wash it in the DW, I would still have my favorite knife block. Now I have a very broken and useless piece of junk."
4,"Very Good, Could Be Better","The great thing about this product is it does what it says- I just wish it supported longer knives, and had increased capacity."
4,Just about perfect,"This is great for folks with a mishmash of brands and duplicate knives. I have everything from a 3"" paring knife to a 10"" chefs in my block. Being able to get everything out of kithen drawers and secure in a block is so nice. My only complaint is that blunt/large knives can be difficult to put in. I can't imagine kitchen shears fitting without breaking off a few fingers."
3,Too Short,"I bought this since it is quite a bit less expensive than regular knife blocks. The only complaint I have is it won't completely cover the blade of my 10"" Chef's Knife. It looks like an 8"" blade would fit properly though."
5,Finally a knife block that handles all my knives!,"I have tried and modified a number of knife blocks, as I have a non-standard collection of knives and it was always a struggle to find something which worked. This is the first knife block that has worked for all my knives and is very easy to use in being able to access and store my knives."
1,Nope Sorry Just a Gimmick,"Plastic shavings, rods break after a few months. Just a cheap trick to get you to get rid of your wooden knife block. Don't bother."
2,Starts out good then teeth break,"Used 7"" size with the Metal Devil saw sold by the same company. Cutting old galvanized steel plumbing pipe from 4"" to 2"". First bunch of cuts were superb; cool cutting, no sparks and easy. After about a dozen cuts, a few teeth broke and subsequent cutting only devolved further. Continuing to use the blade is possible with the broken teeth and still better than abrasive blade in Skil saw but lots of sparks and slower than desired."
3,Good,I am a huge fan of NFG but this DVD is just a little boring. They say the same things over and over.
5,A Must Have!,"Okay, so this DVD is a must have for any fan of New Found Glory that is as big of one as me. 'The Story So Far' shows the guys in their element, and shows how down to earth they really are! Cracking jokes left and right, I could not stop laughing throughout it!This is a great DVD. You will never regret it if you buy it. For those who are fans of New Found Glory, you will become bigger fans. For those who are not fans, watch this and you will be!"
5,Heavenly!,"This second installment of the silver screen angels doesn't disappoint - what a ride! Three beautiful, kick-behind heroines in designer clothes, with ageless Demi Moore as ex-angel-turned-devil to destroy makes for two hours of fun. Think of it as ""Speed"" for chicks. The cameo of original tv angel Kelly Garrett (Jacylyn Smith) was an especially nice touch. Can't wait for number three."
3,A MIXED MOVIE !!!,"I have seen these two movie series, you may think i will review this two movie for garbage movies. But amazing, these two movies mix many elements, includes puzzle, action, comedy, and any others you can see in other movies.I gave 3 stars to these two movies, if you think i am right and 3 stars rating means ""not bad"", then you can accept my suggestion and just take times to see these two movies^^"
2,So So for the kind of boring film,"I saw this film in 1997 for the first time and again after I made the order for this movie to Amazon.com,well without any review,I decided to take chance to view it and the result was...so so....,anyway for this amount of the money I don't think this movie is worth for!"
3,"Sheri keeps it real, but...","I like Sheri very much, she has great natural wit and is very well read. But while this book is better than her first, it reads too much like her own personal journal and I didn't connect with it. I can't imagine a noncelebrity finding an audience for some of the experiences detailed here. I think my biggest problem is that I know Sheri is too intelligent to expect family life to be Sitcom Perfect, so I guess I didn't buy the idea that she would embark on a quest to make it that way."
2,Mobile stops turning,"This appealed to me since I would be able to use it longer than the standard mobile, but it ended up not working when we wanted it to anyways. I liked to idea, but just doesn't work. This mobile constantly stops working (before the 8 minutes are up)...it stops going round. The music continues & the lights are still on, but the base stops rotating, it seems as though it always gets ""stuck"" and we have to push it to get ""unstuck"". We've changed the battery and that doesn't seem to help as the base keeps getting stuck, I contacted Mattel to get a voucher since it's been more than 90 days since I bought this, can't return it in the store. (It's kind of big and ugly too, didn't expect that from the picture.)"
5,Absolutely Perfect,"Honestly, a perfect album, from an immensely talented electro-poet. Vocals and lyrics make the album. Styling and composition are superb. Appreciate the contributions Dear is making to the genre (which I should say he is co-developing/-evolving and carving out a well-deserved niche in) with the likes of early pioneers such as To Rococo Rot right through Calvin Harris, Hot Chip, and Simian Mobile Disco, etc."
3,very good,it was good i just don't understand enough of this kind of music to make a good judgment of it. But it is very beautiful nonetheless
3,Good But not the best,"In ways this game can be fun but in other ways in can be as frustrating as hell!.First, in underground mode you can only race as two cars?!.Drag races get pretty boring after a while.Cop chases are great but why do you always have play as the cop,why not be able to run from cops?!!.Most of the music is good but some [disappoints].And finally graphics are great, as usual with XBOX.So rent it before you buy it."
1,This game does NOT have HDTV support !!!!!!!!!!!!!,Anyone considering buying this game because they thought it supported HDTV as has been written about it ... may want to reconsider before they purchase. This game only supports 480p like ALL other XBOX games.
5,An invaluable step-by-step approach.,"Is anyone making money on the Net besides web developers? If so, how can a small business participate, expanding their customer base and growth potential? The E-Commerce Question & Answer Book joins a few others on how to make money on the internet and addresses many side issues, from whether to hire a programmer to create Web pages to understanding how databases work in the e-commerce world. Invaluable here is a step-by-step approach which rates and discusses options and then tells how to achieve goals."
2,"Great at first, but durability is poor.","Like other reviewers, I think the Bernz-o-Matic TS-4000 Trigger Start Torch Head is a good piece of plumbing equipment. My only addition to their comments is that I have been through three of these in about 5 years. They get to the point where the piezoelectric sparker just stops working. I am an average homeowner who uses the torch infrequently for plumbing, and almost weekly for starting the charcoal grill or wood stove. When the torch no longer sparks, it is just as good as any other, much cheaper, torch head."
5,very handy,This torch is hotter with map gas than propane. comes in handy to heat smaller items than useing the large acetalyne torch.
4,High output propane and mapp torch,"It's a solid torch that puts out a good deal of heat quickly even when using propane. The trigger could be a bit more durable as it tends to misfire after a years worth of use, however it's a good tool by in large."
2,Too glib and superficial to be informative!,"I read this book when it first appeared some ten years ago, having read much of the other work on P. (books by Israel Nestyev, Victor Seroff, etc.). Indeed there is a lack of good literature on P. in English. Unfortunately, Robinson's book is sadly written-down and dumbed-down for a sub-TIME-Magazine reading public. It is not necessary to do so to write a good, readable, un-academic biography (compare the superb bio of poet Marina Tsvetaeva by Viktoria Schweitzer). So this book wasted a fine opportunity: its evaluations of both life and works are simplistic. Robinson claims to be ""above"" the ideological divisions of Cold War Prokofiev scholarship (e.g. pre-Stalinist vs. Socialist Realist Prokofiev), but he does not engage this problem at all, at least not in any thoughtful way, and blurs over it with bland cheery platitudes. Disappointing!"
5,Wonderful Savings,Great savings finding this. They are better quality than the ones at the Local Wally World. And were in stock.
5,Not a Toy...a Necessity!,"The Pump I purchased for my Intex pool only comes with one filter...I ordered 2 of these replacements and they are really a necessity! We clean our filter after each use (body oils, tracked in sand & grass & sun block) having additional filters on hand means the grandkids can change their minds & hit the pool again without a wait for the original filter to be completely cleaned. Highly recommended!"
4,ww2,"THESE FILMS ARE NOT FOUND EASILY,THE PICTURE QUALITY IS NOT AS GOOD AS WHAT WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT FROM DVDS THESE DAYS.I LIKED THESE FILMS,JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT THE PICTURE QUALITY IS MORE LIKE VHS."
1,Upgrade,"Don't waste your time with this torch. I thought I would save a few dollars.. It worked off and on for about a month, then it stopped working all together. I sent it back and ordered a TS4000 Bernzomatic. The last TS4000 I purchased from Amazon is over a year old and still working fine."
3,For fun not realism,"Me, being a huge Gran Turismo Fan, wanted to try something new. The Story is ok, not too bad. Graphics wise its a better than most. Some things I would like to point out though, the game doesnt focus much on realism in my opinion. So if you just want to have fun this is for you"
1,Stupid game.,"This game is nothing more than an interactive commercial promoting various rap artists and a grade B weak plot movie. In no way did the makers of this game intend on making it worth while. Races are ... Everytime you crash your opponents are never far in front of you, but when you get to the finish line, 1 or 2 of them always jumps ahead. And the pong thing while it's loading is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. I'm a persistant guy and played this game for an hour trying to beat one race. After that I stuck the cd in my microwave, fried it, and threw it out the window. Oh yeah, that nice Charger you see on the front cover of the box, unless you spend the next 4 months mastering this game, you'll never get it."
1,Oh my god!,"I just rented this game from [local store] because i love the GT40 by ford (which is the coolest car ever) but anyways, i put it in my PS2 turn the power on and everything. It goes through the intro and stuff then it gets to the loading game pong. You know pretty cool you get to play pong for like 30 seconds.(so i thought) YOU END UP PLAYING PONG FOR TEN MINUTES![.] so i played and then i went to story mode or whatever, goes to the loading screen i am there for 10 minutes and still IT DOESNT COME ON![.] So i said forget this game [is bad][!]trust me if you are even thinking about this game my advice is rent it look at the loading time then make your decision. TRUST ME!"
4,Fills the bill,Purchased to make my dog stand out from the target animals during deer season. Am surrounded by novice deer hunter December and January.
5,Eucarion is well thought out and extremely original.,"Mr. Samlaska provided me with a riveting reading experience. I started this book on Friday and finished it on Sunday morning. Eucarion is a page-turner in the style of one of my favorite authors, Michael Crichton. Curt P. Samlaska shows off his vast knowledge in the areas of science, medicine, and psychology. Do yourself a favor and purchase this book."
5,Eucarion! Just the title evokes the imagination.,"In a world full of instant information, techno-scientific growth, and present global economics, author Curt Samlaska finds a subject from which great books are made. His intent is unwavering. The climatic ending restores faith in us all. If your weary of the copy-cat, pseudo-intellectual, non-imaginative reads, then take a glance at Eucarion. This is the stuff Hollywood makes into a movie. Eucarion is destine for the big screen, just what the doctor ordered!"
1,Don't buy this junk,I bought the old Rio and was very pleased. Lost it and made the mistake of buying the new Forge before any reviews were out. I've exchanged it twice already because it keeps shutting off. I'm so angry that Rio would put such a piece of garbage out on the market. They should refund everyone's money no questions asked. DO NOT buy this player. You'll regret it. Now I have to go see if Best Buy's protection plan will allow me to get a different player...
1,Not so good...,"I got this player as a present and ever since, I have had alot of troubles with it!First of all...within the same month, the player got so hot and the battery was scalding hot...and it melted parts of the plastic on the player!!! I NEVER throw away warrantees, but I must've thrown it out with the bag...so that was my horrid mistake! But I didn't expect it to get so hot that it melted plastic! I still do not know why it did this...I was still able to play it however..but over time, it would shut off like others have said, and it would freeze and it would do weird things. I had to be a magician to get the dang thing to work!~If I could just reiterate, I would not recommend this product due to product defects and the way that mine almost caught fire a few times!! Rio is no longer around...please take this as a clue in case you want to buy a used one!!!"
1,Very unhappy....,"I've had my Rio Forge 256 for 7 months. I only use it about 2-3 times a week no longer than one hour each use. Over the last couple months, I've been experiencing problems with my unit. More recently, it turns off for no reason. It sounds like a lot of people are experiencing problems with this unit. If you go to the Rio website, they have a Q&A of issues, I've experienced most of them. I'm still working with Rio to figure out a way to fix the problems I've been experiencing. This unit is made for active use and it doesn't seem like it's holding up very well. I'd recommend looking into a different brand if you're shopping for an MP3 player."
1,DO NOT BUY - 2 HAVE CRASHED,"I bought one - tried to add expansion card - it crashed. Returned it figuring it was a fluke. NOPE! Second one crashed too. I am using latest firmware (1.33) and have tried all of their suggested ""fixes"". What's worse - Rio appears to know they have a problem and continue to sell it without a solution."
4,My MP3 Player,"This is the first MP3 Player I've ever listened to and I got one for my birthday! It has a sleek silver look, can hold up to 120 songs, and has a very good sound quality. I had a couple of problems with it though. The FM Radio didn't come in and one of the headphones was messed up. Overall, I like this a lot."
2,Forge not up to par,"i purchased a iRiver 790 for my girlfriend and a Rio Forge 256 for myself. boy do i wish i had ordered the iRiver for myself. not only did her player cost less, it sounds better and works flawlessly. the only thing better about my forge is the armband. i hate to say this, but i've been happier with my cheapo irock! 520 (bought used). sigh. okay, here we go: first of all, i spent the extra $$ to get the 256MB player because i wanted to be able to record clips from the radio. only problem is that the radio doesn't work. period. second, the darn thing has problems turning itself on. sometimes it takes 2 or 3 tries before it stays on. i called customer support and the only thing they could tell me was that i needed to update the firmware. by the way, that did not fix the problem. third of all, the player isn't designed terribly well. the battery cover is difficult to get off, and the plastic tabs that hold it shut aren't terribly sturdy and are already showing wear."
1,Shut Off Problem,"Don't buy this product. I received this MP3 player as a gift for running and other active sports. Unfortunately, it shuts off at the slightest tap. I've been told that the problem is the spring that holds the battery, but no amount of fiddling seems to solve the problem. It still works if I place it very carefully on a level surface when I use a machine at the gym, but the slightest tap will shut it off. It is maddening!!!"
1,Makes a Nice Paperweight,"If you're looking for a nifty, futuristic-looking paperweight, this item is the one for you. All you have to do is buy it and use it. It will die on you, sometime not long after the too-short 90-day warrantee expires, leaving you with no way to make it right. You will receive absolutely no help from Rio customer service. So, Voila! You have a paperweight.That is what happened to me. The Forge was nice enough while it worked, which was for about 8 months. Then, it suddenly and unexpectedly completely died. Nothing brings it back to life; Rio customer service very helpfully tells me that it seems my device needs to be relaced--which they won't do, since it's beyond the warrantee.If you're looking for a paperweight, though, it would be much more cost-effective to get and paint a rock."
1,Awful!,"This book is for people that already know Russian. Not only that, it must be for Russian children. There are illustrations (just like the cover) that look like a coloring book along with the items corresponding names written in Russian over them. There are no translations for these words in English. I would highly recommend a phrase book if you are hoping to learn a bit of Russian. This would prove useful to you."
1,Not good for stydying Russian,"If I would be able to look inside this book, however not expensive it is, I would not order the 10 copies for my students in Russian language class. Not only these 500 words are not so common for general (beginning) conversation, there are some spelling mistakes in Russian. In addition to that, the book without any colors, presuming the students would color it thus covering the names of the objects, -- not so smart idea. Sorry, I spent my money."
2,Russian Picture Word Book,I would like to have seen the English equivalent to the words and an English way to say them.
1,"Facts about who built the Forbidden City, Peking","I picked up this book at a local library for my daughter, who's in Pre-School now, but her reading skill is at/near First Class level (told by her teacher.) As I scanned through the pages, something had struck me with amaze:""One emperor built a magnificient palace on the River of Perfumes in the city of Hue, surrounded by majestic mountains. Modeled after the famous Forbidden City in Peking, China. it was a city within a city, ..."" _Page 28For those who know much about the history of Forbidden City in Peking would find it such a disturbing fact that Nguyen An (also called Ruan An) was the main architect who built it. He was a Vietnamese ... Over all, this book is good in a way, I will let my kid read it, but with my ""further"" explanation in this part."
5,Mushrooms!,I've been thoroughly studying this book for several weeks and am looking forward to foraging in the woods for some mushrooms this summer and fall. The book gives multiple identifying features for each mushroom both edible and poisonous! A must read for any avid naturalist!!!
5,A must for any visual artist,"Along with its companion book in the series - The Designer's Guide to Color Combinations, The Designer's Guide to ""Global"" Color Combinations forms an essential reference for any visual artist or print publisher. I recommend these books to my students for their concept, storyboarding, color design, and animation layout work.Each page breaks down a period, era, or style, and analyzes its color makeup with color and contrast swatches, CMYK data for each color, and a series of various combinations that are possible using the specified palette.An artist could spend hours testing and comparing colors. Or they could look through these pages and find a color scheme in minutes."
5,The Curse of Cain,It is an excellent read. The authors took the Lincoln assassination and by moving the facts a few degrees gave it a whole new perspective. The authors obviously did mountains of research to make the story and characters as historically correct as possible. Character development is great and I had trouble putting the book down.
2,Very disappointing,"I love Forever Knight, but this is one of the worst DVD sets I've ever seen. No special features, horrible picture quality. The price they're charging for it is absolutely criminal. The Buffy DVDs are packed with special features and don't cost anywhere near as much. My old VHS tapes are better quality, and I have Canadian versions. This set is a waste of money."
4,Forever Knight Part 1,"I enjoyed the series, even more than when I was a child and missed all the little details!My copy was good, though the packaging was damaged, the video quality was much better than I had heard I would get. Some of the older series are pretty bad, but this one is not. I am watching it on a good HD TV and DVD player, so maybe that helps out. I don't know enough about that to say.I am glad I got it though."
5,great vampire detective series,"This series was excellent!What really makes this series unique and unrivaled are the flashbacks on Nick Knight's earlier experiences through time (ie- during the Middle Ages, the Cold War, etc..) and his battles with Lacroix, his vampire mentor.It is also very entertaining to watch him use his vampire powers like a ""Superman"" to catch villians."
4,Educating the Democratic Mind,James A. Banks is a prolific author of multicultultural education and gives insight into the kind of behavior we should strive for with respect to citizenship education.
2,Guns at Batasi DVD,"The title of the film, as well as the photo on the DVD cover, make one assume that this is an action film; however, it really isn't. Richard Attenborough and the African officer act rather well, but overall I find this film rather tedious and boring. Also, I couldn't figure out the significance of Mia Farrow's presence. The enhanced black-and-white 2.35:1 picture is very good."
4,if the stone would sit in the prongs,This earring is gorgeous. The stone is prettier than the picture. Only problem I had was the prongs holding the stone was not that succesfull. It's fallen off twice. My good luck in both cases I was able to find the stone took it to jewellery store. The prety stone is now in place safe and secure!
2,What's the real price,I went to mysimon.com to do a price search for golden tee software and was shown 9.99 for the 2 titles. When I got to amazon I see the pprice has increased to 14.99. What's going on?
5,The Farm Book that sure brings back great memories,"I must admit, The American Family Farm is one great book on farm memories and agricultural science. I only bought it because I have a big inteerest in farming, and if you do, this a book that you won't be able to put down!"
3,This is ok...,"I LOVE Jewel but this album sure doesnt beat Spirit or Peices of you. I dunno, its hard to explain, its like the songs are a bit generic, Goodbye Alice in Wonderland is good, and so is a Good Day. I think maybe its just lacking a bit of soul, it just doesnt seem alot like the old Jewel we are all used too."
2,A long slow slide for sure....,"Jewel.....Jewel....what have you done to yourself? This album is merely the latest in the singer's long, slow slide into music oblivion.I, like so many listeners, loved Jewel's early work and her early live events, but as the lyrics in this latest fiasco illustrate, it's been a long, slow slide for her, even though (or perhaps because) she ""wants to belong"".But more important than the steady deterioration in the quality of her work, is I believe the fact that Jewel has literally ""become"" the kind of singer/entertainer that she originally overshadowed. How very sad!!"
2,It's BOB MOSLEY but the label is SAN FRANCISCO SOUND,"The problem here is a good musician such as Bob Molsey is recording for a label as notoriously bad as San Francisco Sound. Guess where the royalties go? The MATTHEW KATZ SUES MOBY GRAPE AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY FUND. It's your choice, like anything on the SFS label, you buy the discs and you give Katz your money to sue your favorite band."
3,Pilates for dorks,"This is a great DVD for beginners but definitely not for anyone else. Neither Kathy nor her assistant Lea(sp??) seem to have a dance background, something that is usually necessary when instructing Pilates. Their own lack of flexibility hinders the moves they try to demonstrate. Plus, the set is awful and distracting.One great thing- the music. The music is not distracting, is timed to the movements of the exercise and helps set the mood."
3,Insights of a senior acupuncturist:One combination of points,"I found Miriam Lee's book very interesting. As a student in a traditional chinese medicine institute I have a lot of books on points and acupuncture and many of them can be quite tedious for the beginning student. I found not only her stories interesting but the insights to treatment principles very helpful. I am about to finish my first year in school and some of the information I have already learned made more sense after reading her book. I intend to kept it and refer to it often. Not only was it very informative but an interesting read as well, as a matter of fact the day I came home and found it had arrived I became so interested in it that I stayed up late reading it and forgot to make dinner."
1,Not for the discriminating reader - SPOILER,"Being tired of the sanitized Mary Sue- and Gary Stu-vampires a la Twilight, the glowing reviews for this book enticed me to buy it, and I really wanted to like it (especially since I have a soft spot for truckers). Unfortunately, instead of merely hinting at the plot, the summary on the back cover gives away the whole story, and the poorly executed third person omniscient narrative, hopping haphazardly between characters, quickly destroys any seed of suspense.Overall, the book reads like the script for a cheap SyFy channel movie. It is full of one-dimensional, cliched characters and the story depends so much on coincidences that it is preposterous. Of course you always have to suspend pretty much all your beliefs in order to take any vampire story seriously, but I felt insulted when the author presented a truckload of garlic (in the middle of winter, at a snowed-in truck-stop) as the solution to the vampire siege."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,This is a sad set of fitness videos. They are full of late 80's to 90's videos (that probably were not even popular in their day.) and are packaged as if they are the best new set of videos out there. The picture quality is very poor and the content quality is even worse. The only thing this set has going for it is the number of different workouts it has.
4,Great for Weight Loss on Low Budget,"I think that for the price this is a good deal. The Kick Butt and Tai Fit are good kickboxing workouts. The first Kick Butt is milder, the second and Tai Fit are higher level. Tracy Lords' workout might be somewhat disturbing for some people but the second version is without words except 'transition' to indicate each new exercise so once you learn the moves you don't need to look at her much. It is low impact but great for weight loss. It includes stretchning and all body parts. The step workout is good as well. It definitely helps with weight loss. It is relatively low impact. Yogacise is OK if you just want to stretch and you can do all of the segments for a fuller workout."
5,It's also Solace of the heart...,"Solace of the Eyes is always my first choice, whether at home alone or entertaining friends. Its soft jazz and beautifully sung vocals fit any occasion.For anyone who's never heard her, Tadia's voice is like a gift from God. It's like the voice of an angel who sweeps her vocal hand across my forehead and soothes me. She can't be compared to anyone else. She has a unique sound and style, and every note is heavenly.Solace of the Eyes is soothing to my heart, and Tadia's performance is solace to my ears as well. I'd love to see her in concert. Then she'd be Solace to my eyes as well."
4,A new fave in my workout dvd collection,"I really enjoy this DVD! You can combine segments taken from her 5 previous tapes/dvds and program it to your own preference. It's a boredom buster because you won't get bored doing the same workout everyday. The problem though is that there is no warm up and cool down so that's a disappointment.I any case, I still consider this DVD a great buy because the almost 2 hour workout is definitely a fat blaster!"
1,Unreliable Junk!,I got three of these receivers a little over a year ago as part of a Directv package. One failed within 9 months - menus would no longer appear. The other two would lock up and have to go through a 5 minute system reset every couple of days. I have since replaced them with Samsung s300w's.
2,You have to dig through a lot to get negotiating nuggets.,"There were a few good tips on negotiating in this tape but they were burried among lots of other almost meaningless stuff. For instance, the author makes it a point to set your mission and values before beginning negotiations. OK, good point. But then he proceeds to spend 10 minutes or so on the subject instead of referring the reader to a book on the subject. Other suggestions include speaking clearly ... making sure the other party hears ""five"" instead of ""fine"". Later in the tape he cuts short some negotiating tips for lack of time and suggests that the listener buy the book!"
5,Great Songs,I really like this .cd I love the song AYlissa Lies It is beautiful .It is a really great Cd I would reccomend That people buy this CD.
1,More Cookie Cutter Classics,"I like the Alyssa Lies song quite a bit and that, along with a YouTube clip of Jason singing ""Purple Rain"", are what motivated me to purchase the record from Amazon. Unfortunately though, this kid's baritone seems prefabricated and conceived in the studio, and not anywhere near his soul. There are a couple decent songs (Looking At You and Alyssa for sure) but this guy smacks of made-up, dressed-up, tarted-up Nashville slog reminicient of Ty Herndon, Kevin Sharp, and a host of other pretenders. I think this CD and it's singer are destined for the one hit wonder bin at your local garage sale. Cannot hold a candle to Josh Turner, Randy Travis, Keith Whitley, or the other BETTER baritone singers that have graced the radio waves in the past."
5,Great Video,This is a great video from any child who likes Elmo & Abbey from Seasame Street. My daughter (2) really enjoys it. It is just the right length to keep her attention. I highly recommend it. I could not find it sold in any store and was glad to find it on Amazon.
1,A Huge Disappointment!,"If you loved their first album, a combination of folk and pschydelic/acid rock with long, multidimentional songs, this is going to be a big disappointment: short, simple, country/blue grass pop songs with some of the worst lyrics of the period. Imagine the very worst songs of early Jefferson Airplane. This sounds like a Holiday Inn band you would have heard in the early seventies."
4,An enjoyable workout...,"I did this video a couple of days ago for the first time and I really enjoyed it. It flies by so fast (which is the best part for me). Also, her active recovery routines (which follow the 2-minute explosive ones) help to shape the lower part of the body with plenty of squats and some lunges (though not too much, thank God). You're given the choice of low-impact or hi-impact so this video is good for beginners and intermediates (and maybe even advanced). For a total-body workout, combine this video with some exercises for the upper body, and you can get a terrific workout in a short amount of time."
3,"Good content, but no truth in advertising!",I purchased this video as I wanted a good all-around workout. It was not clear on the package that this tape concentrates on the lower body. This is not what I wanted and I was disappointed in that respect. Kathy Smith is a good instructor and delivers a solid workout here for the lower body. Buyer beware that the title of the video is misleading!
3,"Good, but not of of Kathy's best","I could not get into the music on this tape at all. Very quite when she talked/instructed, which was all the time, then it got a little louder inbetween. The music was just bad, when you could hear it. I also didn't care for the ""living room theme"" since I workout at home, I'd rather see something else like outdoors, a nice back-drop, or even a gym setting. Yet, if you aren't bothered by what I've said, you can get in a decent workout. I had to do the higher impact to get a good workout, which hurt my feet, but that may not be the case for everyone."
3,Stacy's review,"I think this tape is great for medium level fitness video. Also beginner's can take it down a notch to suit them. As always, Kathy seems a little on the dingy side but I still enjoy her workouts."
5,Al Jolson Story and Al Jolson Sings Again,"this set of movies starring Larry Parks is my favorite of all time. I play them, on the average of every few months. I like being entertained and I am never disappointed each and every time, although I can practicallybe there and repeat word for word.He was the Worlds Greatest entertainer, in my books too."
2,Great Sound-Cropped Picture Stinks!,To make those people happy who want to fill their large screen TV's they zoomed in on the 3:4 original aspect ratio and cut off the bottom 3rd of the image. Remastered sound is fantastic-But 1/3 of the movie is missing. Shame on the remastering people for ruining this classic.
1,The Jolson story,"Can't view the DVD was cracked when we recieved it and all of the ""return or exchange"" links available will not recognized our account so we can exchange it. Very disappointed in this transaction. We cannot find a phone number for assistance either."
3,This book was good for the most part,"In general, this book was an eye opening view into the events that happened on various NC rivers. For the first few chapters the scientific inquiry was interesting, and made the book more enjoyable to read. However, there was abundance of political materials, and decreased the overall feel of the novel. Even though it was based on actual events, it seemed disconnected and apart for the real world. To the contrary, the use of first hand accounts and historical events placed the whole book into perspective. Overall, it was a good novel, and would be recommended to anyone who enjoys ""Outbreak"" like novels, and don't mind politics."
5,Worth having!!!!!!!!,"The 2002 Brentwood home video which is a bio of ozzy. Unlike Many other unofficial bio dvds this has Actual interviews with ozzy, Concert and music video footage. As well as interviews with tony iommi, geezer butler, lita ford, rob halford, and music fans. There is alot of stuff on this dvd which is very rare and until they were released on this dvd they were selling vhs copies of on ebay for hundreds of $$$$$$. (Such as the making of segment on the movie 'trick or treat'. A vhs copy of it ended up auctioning for almost 200$ on ebay. It was one of those promotional vhs they play in the video stores.) Due to all the rare footage this is a well worth having dvd."
1,Why Don't The Pride Judges Ever Stand It Up,Fights are slow all laying down i couldn't even use the word grapple ther isn't any i thought John Macarthy Let them fall asleep in the UFC.Now i realise he just stops great fights way to earlyBut In Pride the refs just let em' lay and lay.....ZZZzzz.... Sorry falling asleep there.Plain Garbage!!!!!
5,Love Scenes.,"As a fan of mostly 40s and 50s movies, I have collected some of my favorites. I don't have this one yet and hope I can get a reformated(?) version, because I think it is wide-screen. The Last Wagon is one of my all time favorites because it has the best love scene (between Richard Widmark and Felicia Farr) in movie history! You can have your Clark Gables and Cary Grants, I'll take Richard any day."
2,You get what you pay for....,"I really liked this little grinder (""liked"" being the key word here). The internal cord storage was easy to use and kept my countertops clear of cords. The one touch start and automatic shutoff so I didn't have to hold the button. Several different grinds. What more could I ask for? How about a longer lifespan? I had the same problem the first reviewer did. After only a few months of use, the ring at the top broke making it impossible for the cap to push the safety interlock switch. Walla....instant paperweight!"
3,Not really for me...,"Not a bad book of esoteric specifications, but generallly not something that I need either. Wish I would have spent my money on something else."
3,Mafia Soap,"Unlike the first three seasons, this fourth season dealt mainly with the personal lives and problems of its characters. Many of these were situations that are common to oh-so-many of us. I felt I was watching a soap-opera with details.Not until Paulie gets released does the familiarity of the series begin to appear, but only temporarily. As always the acting was superb. BUT, the story is about the mafia AND the people within it. Not about love lost, broken hearts, ""oh-what-am-I-gonna-do-now? Occasionally, okay. But not for the majority of a season.Anyway, I hope number five has an even balance of the business end coupled with the ""family"" side."
5,THE BEST,THIS IS THE BEST SEASON EVER. bUY IT AND WATCH IT TONS OF TIMES. THIS IS THE BEST SHOW EVER.
4,You've gone this far!!,"Well if you're on s4 then you must like what you see, so why stop now? I have every season and have yet to get bored with it. Buy this!!"
4,Lightening kills,Bought this after my neighbors house was hit by lightening and it destroyed my dsl modem. So I bought this and it has the phone protection and coaxial protection. Once again lightening struck and everything survived that was hooked to this. Don't know about the warranty issues but this product seems to work.
4,Performs as advertised,Have been using this for over a year without any problems. Have had very bad weather in GA and it seems to protect my equipment well.
3,Doodle Pro is better,"Durable, but lights are very distracting & bright. My 5 year old son enjoys it, but gets frustrated because it is sometimes difficult to write on. I think the Doodle Pro is better."
3,"Melodramatic soaper, badly dubbed","An older man (Marcello Mastoianni) falls in love with a girl (Natassia Kinski) 20 years his junior. Friends put the seed in his head that she may be his daughter, which he can't prove one way or the other. He's torn by the guilt of this possibility; he's also concerned about her youth - a completely different generation: do they have anything in common? But at the end he goes off with her anyway. The acting leaves much to be desired, but it's an interesting idea. WARNING: The dubbing is terrible."
3,"Great Book, Useless DVD","The book has some really good information, great ideas for firming up and strengthening through the utilization of the excercise ball. The DVD on the otherhand (the fact that it had a DVD was partly why I purchased this book) was absolutely worthless. Paul has no personality. He looks lost throughout the video. A couple times I noticed the two people behind him almost look embarrassed. The DVD shows you how to do a few of the exercises from the book, but ONLY the basic ones. Blah blah blah. If I had known the DVD was such a joke, I most likely would not have bought this product."
4,some good ideas,i bought a ball and wasn't sure what to do with it. there are some real good ideas for working out and stretching in this book. it is well illustrated and easy to follow.
2,Quirky Player,"I've had similar problems with my Rio as other people have. It would turn itself off all the time. I went on their website to look for help, and was directed to update the firmware. The instructions even said that updating twice might be necessary. I'm not sure why you'd need to update twice, but it was from their own website. I followed the directions, holding down the ""MENU"" button at the same time I plugged the USB cable into the computer. After the second try the update was 'successful.'For now, the switching off problem seems to have stopped. Time will tell if it comes back or not.I would recommend another player, as the update procedure is quite involved."
5,Rio Forge MP3 Player,I am very happy with my new MP3 Player. I bought it for downloading books. I didn't have any problems with downloading or playing the book except the instructions for playing an audio book were not as stated. Perhaps it was the way I downloaded the book. I would recommend to anyone as a very inexpensive MP3 player for audio book listening.
2,Find another player,"This is the third Rio Forge I've owned. If you can buy a replacement plan for this unit it will be money well-spent. I've replaced this model twice and am on my third unit which has just broken down after about 9 months. I had the first generation Rio Sport and I loved it. It was a great player and, apart from the lack of space, was perfect in every way. The ""upgrade"" to the Forge series was a serious mistake. I'm taking this unit back and begging to be allowed to exchange it for another brand. The player constantly goes into ""upgrader"" mode and either has to be reformatted (which wipes the flash drive clean) or you have to hope that taking the battery out for 20 minutes solves the problem (more often then not it doesn't and then you need to reformat). The Rio Music Manager software is easy to use and navigate through."
2,Apple has a near monopoly for a reason,"I cannot think of a single good reason to buy this product anymore. I bought it because I was wary of using an Ipod during exercise; however I know now that it's not an issue. The people at Rio have not created good software to go along with their products, and thus I often have problems when syncing with my computer. You can tell the thing is cheap when you take it out of the box, and the flimsy headphones probably won't last long. Verdct--Why buy this when for a little more money you can get a much larger storage device that can accomodate multiple file types and has good software?"
1,Great Player if it Worked :(,"I bought 1 of these from Amazon and another from Best Buy, the 1st one died after 10 days and the other lasted 2 days. There seems to be some problem from reading all the reviews, both of mine just stopped working with no warning, the one I used lasted 10 days and was faultless until it stopped, the other one let my son load it up, played for about 1 hours then died (and yes I put new batteries in for those who might wonder). I wish it HAD worked as promised but it suffers from poor engineering it would seem and no Quality Assurance program. I had bought 2 of them from differenet sources and BOTH died, I then read of people had that bought it with similar problems so I have to assume they put out a piece of untested junk! Invest in some other player, there are several out there, I bought a Sandisk 1 gig for about the same money and it works great, controls not as easy but does what it promised."
1,Failed after a week,The player went superbly for a week then failed with an internal memory corruption issue which may explain why Digital Networks are no longer going to make and market mp3 players.
2,Thank God I finished It,"This is a not a worthwhile read but I was determined to stick it out. My final thoghts were - I just want this to be over -How could all these people be so stupid? Very jerky plot - too many villians without believeable motives and shallow characters with no development. Seemed like just another attempt to out horror the current horrorers. (Is that really a word?) If this is typical Goddard, this is my first at last attempt at him. Thank heavens I got it a the used book store and didn't pay full price."
1,Don't trust these,"The first time I used these gloves I felt the heat of a log burn my hand. I already have ""fireproof"" gloves that I've used over and over to pick up burning logs and they have always protected my hands. These are garbage, and they don't do what they claim to do."
2,Not enough detail!!!,"Although Wilderness Basics covers the essential topics regarding roughing it in the outdoors, it lacks sufficient detail for novice campers. The authors should have added more depth to the gear section, particularly about tents. Furthermore, they failed to adequately discuss weatherproofing for tents. There are some topics that are good, and campers should no them, but I was looking for a book to keep in my pack for reference. This book was not it. Happy travels!"
5,Chilling,"I suggest you read the book ""The Iceman: Confessions of a Mafia Hitman"" to get the complete story before you view this DVD. I couldn't put the book down! I wanted to see his face and demeanor afterwards, so I bought the DVD. Chilling. His eyes are flat and cold, the Grim Reaper in person. If he has one redeeming quality, it is that some of his victims were as evil as he was (well, almost) and the world is a better place without them."
1,dissapointed,"received, opened and found out that there is no build in tea-strainer. So tea particles will get free into the nose and into the cup when used. Our previous model has a tea strainer - simple wall with holes which separates nose from the body of the pot and prevents tea particles from flowing into your cup. Amazon should better describe the product in specification."
3,A complex protagonist,"Dimple, the main character of ""Wife"" is portrayed in such a way by Mukherjee that the reader is left wondering about the attitude that he or she develops towards her. Mukherjee takes us deep into the mind of Dimple as she makes a transition from being single to marrying a husband chosen by her father,and from living in the familiar surroundings of Calcutta to moving to the so-perceived violent city of New York. As the novel progresses, Dimple's hidden unstable personality reveals itself leaving the reader shocked, yet entranced."
1,Does not replace a good chalk line,"I have tried to use this tool on several surfaces - roof shingles, plywood sheets etc, and have not found it to work well.It is too delicate and only seems to work on perfectly flat surfaces. Not recommended. Give me a good old chalk line anytime. I'm sorry I bought it."
2,NASCAR Racing 2002 Season,"Excellent graphics, fast cars. Problem, I spin out often. I have been racing NASCAR for 2 years and I have won several championships. I have been trying to play this game but it won't let me. I have practiced and practiced to no avail. I have read the book over and over. Yet, at any time, any lap, I spin towards the left. You spin out, go against the wall and that is where you stay. I usually have post position 1 and I am usually ahead and for no reason, even though I glide into the curve and speed up slowly I still spin out. You are against the wall and you can only wait for all cars to go by. From 1st to 43 on one spin. 2003 does not do this. Computer cars are too agressive. Yes , they have great crashes, I don't want to crash, I want to win. I am selling my 2004 and 2002. My fantasy. Too real for me."
4,Jamaican poetry in motion,"Imagine rap-like delivery of true poetry with a hypnotic Jamaican accent, all done before rap was even around. That's Mutabaruka! I have enjoyed his unique poetry/music style for many years, so I am guessing his video is worth at least 4 stars, even if I have not actually seen it (yet!)."
3,Replacement for a 1988 RX-7,It worked in my application but I like to keep everything original in the car. I switched the knob to accomplish that but the threads didn't match up and had to do some modifications. Not the original look.
2,Double vision,"Buttefield seems to suffer from double vision in this book. While his descriptions of Buddhist practice are accurate, his focus is unclear. He seems as unable to come to terms with his relationship to Trungpa as he is with his relationship to his own ego. The book struck me as self-indulgent and whimsical, not in the sense of being light-hearted but in the sense of being driven by ever-changing momentary mood. While I believe there is much to be said about Trungpa and his method, this book is not a trustworthy source."
4,excellent christmas movie arrived in good condition,the movie arrived on time looking ok. box was slightly worn but i was more interested in the tape quality. the beginning looked a little pinched but when i put it in my vcr it played perfectly with good quality. was somewhat deterirated in quality but not enough to bother me for the dvd copy i made of it. dealing with the seller was ok. they reqested this review and i am happy to comply and share this . if i needed something else and they had it i would have no problems ordering from them in the future. kenduski.
4,Please bring this movie back to TV,"I remember watching this movie when I was about 7 years old around Christmas time. For the next few Christmases, I would check the TV guide to find out when it would be on again. Sadly, I don't think this movie has aired since the 80s. This is a truly wonderful, heartwarming story that really captures true Christmas spirit, which I feel is lacking in most modern Christmas movies.Young Robbie's grandfather (Mickey Rooney) has promised to show him Christmas time in NYC. Grandfather dies shortly before they are to leave for their trip...but heaven gives him a second chance to take his grandson to NYC.Now I am almost 30 and I still check the TV listings every year just in case it airs. It never does, so I am going to purchase the VHS .I recommend this underated movie for anyone who loves Christmas."
