5,good earplugs,I bought two types of earplugs just to try and these were the better ones by far. I am so happy to be able to swim freestyle now. I have very bad ears. will buy again
3,Works all right,"After reading the reviews of these I was quite excited to use them. But I have not 100% thrilled with themPros: easy to get out, seem more sanitary than the wax ear plugs.Cons: They stick out a bit so either my swim cap seemed to pull them or they would come loose while swimming when my arm would brush my ear.I will continue to use them as for me it is better to only have a small amount of water leaking in than ears full of water."
1,BEWARE THIS PRODUCT IS FOR YOUR EARS!!!,"I purchased this item for my yearly trip to India. Indian food always runs my digestive system ragged and I wanted to purchase an item to help control my bowel movements. Much to my surprise these items turned out to be ""aqua blocks"" not ""anal blocks""! They are for your ears! Using them for any other body cavity is highly inadvisable. I will be repurchasing an appropriate product."
5,Work very effectively,"I got these ear-plugs for my husband who had ""swimmers ear"". He said with these, no water gets in his ear. And he also says he doesn't hear me talking much so he considers this a separate positive product feature, haha :)"
3,Just so so,"The quality is perfect, but it seems like a little small.I will buy that again because of its price."
4,Nice Light Read,"This was a nice, quick light read. I liked the author's writing style. There was not as much chemistry or romantic encounters between the hero and heroine as I would like, but the plot kept me turning the pages wanting to find out how the story would play out. Liked the book and author's style enough to be confident to purchase more by Leigh Michaels."
2,Plastic and cheap,"Simply- this product is so plastic feeling and is NOT worth the money. It's cute enough, but worthy of a child's record collection or maybe a teenager who is interested in having something attractive to put in their room."
3,Toffler,"I worked for Andersen for over a decade. Never heard of this person, or her practice. Too bad she never made herself or her practice heard within the firm.Somewhat of a jaded view, self-serving writeup explaining her failures to build a practice or business for her service line. Coming in as a partner, she certainly seemed to have to rely on others, rather than building her practice.She does make some good points of internal conflicts regarding billing practices. But if she was a true leader, she could sell her own projects by herself, as many top rated partners could. She relied on others to bring business to her, and then she was disappointed when she had to fight for revenues. Why did she not build her own practice?Too bad Barbara did not write this book BEFORE the failure of Andersen -- I'd then give her credit for sticking her neck out. Rather, she just piles on."
1,Don 't Waste Your Money,"Someday someone will write an insightful look into the fall of Arthur Andersen. This isn't it.I was very disappointed in this self-serving and surprisingly shallow work. It seems to have been written to generate a fast buck and to push the inflated self-view of the author. It does not contain any new inside stories or analysis...if that's what you're looking for, you'll do better pulling out a few old Wall Street Journal articles. The author was a junior direct-admit partner at AA. She did not grow up in AA and as such isn't qualified to describe the culture. Nor was she high enough in the firm to really know what was going on.Save your money...wait until a real inside story gets published."
3,"Great retro design, poor radio reception",I really like this design. Looks good on the shelf. But the radio reception is poor. I've got this radio in the same spot as I had another retro radio and it doesn't pick up nearly as good. The antenna might be too short for the internal circuitry perhaps?
2,Below expected,"It is not what I expected. Plastic rims, quite big, poor signal (maybe because of my location). The dial doesn't have light."
1,CD purchase doesnt play,"Beware!This CD arrived promptly in a broken case. It doesn't play except in a computer. Very disappointing for 29.00--even though I couldn't find it available elsewhere.The original recording is a fabulous set of performances by Eduardus Halim. I heartily recommend it, but should you be lucky enough to find a copy of this CD, do not purchase from this seller."
1,This book rocks!,"I saw this at the bookstore and when I say that The Rock endorsed it, I bought it. After taking a spin through it, I can see why-it's a diet book that talks about how to eat right and exercise right, as opposed to all the other books that either do one or the other. Pretty funny to read, too. If you want to lose weight, buu this book."
2,Don't bother,"I absolutely loved alot of his healthy eating ideas, but I never lost ANY weight or inches. I stuck to it for 3 months. I really wanted it to work. I think maybe if you are not overweight, it won't work for you. I was just trying to lose some inches...and tone up my midsection."
5,Abs Diet: The Six-Week Plan to Flatten Your Stomach and Keep You Lean for Life,"Although I do not think others lost the weight as stated in the book, I have found the book extremely helpful. Great advice and fantastic visual aids to assist the reader. Wish I had this available 20 years ago."
2,"silly, silly, silly!","Abs diet?come on. Does fat know where to go?Oh, Mr. Oreo, please don't go to my abs, go to my calf?If you think fat has intelligence and won't go to your abs, then you need a shrink, not a diet book."
5,Great pics!,"Bought this as present for 11 & 12 yr. old grandsons. They do alot of camping, have hiked Hawk Mountain and generally love the outdoors. It's very descriptive with beautiful pictures. I read through the whole book before I wrapped it. :)"
5,Panasonic TH-42PX60U - great product!,This set has a terrific picture and I find myself watching odd TV programs just to enjoy the HD. It was easy to install and the controls and instructions were very straightforward. Only trouble I had was with my local cable technician who tried to hook up tohis HDTV box using coax... leading to a delay until I figured out the connection should have been with a composite cable.
1,red light flashes 11 times,"Had a good picture while it lasted. If I can get the set to turn on, it stays on for about 45 min. then pop! no picture or sound and the little red light flashes 11 times, pauses, and flashes 11 more times. NOT what I expected from a Panasonic product. From what I've read, this is a problem others have experienced with this tv an will cost you $600 or more to be fixed. My solution is to stay away from this Manufacturer and today I purchased a Sony 46"" LCD for $950 which includes tax and shipping. Don't be a fool and throw away your $$$$ like I did. I paid $2300 three years ago. You won't pay as much today but do you want to take the chance????"
1,Panasonic Plasma TV's are only good for 2 yrs.,"I purchased a Panasonic Plasma TV and after 2 years the panel went bad. The warranty on the panel is only for 2 years, that's because the people at Panasonic know that the panel will go bad after that time. I emailed, spoke to them online, and even called them with no luck of getting a replacement panel sent to me so i can fix the problem. It's been almost 2 years that I've been trying to get my tv panel fixed, but everytime I try to get in touch with these people, they give me the run around. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING PANASONIC PLASMA TV'S, THE PANEL GOES BAD AFTER 2 YEARS.I am very dissapointed with the staff at Panasonic, and I will write to BBB and file a report there as well.PLEASE DO NOT BUY PANASONIC PLASMA TV'S... DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH THIS COMPANY.... I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND SONY PLASMA TVS."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON!!!,Do not buy this TV from Amazon - I have received two of these in the last 7 days - both with cracked screens - and Amazon's customer servis is awful. The first arrived damaged and it took a week of non-stop phone calls to get a replacement. THe replacement arrived today - cracked - and I'm being told that someone will call NEXT WEEK - I can't even get a refund yet. DO NOT BUY THIS TV FROM AMAZON!
4,incredible talent!,When i first heard this cd i knew i was hearing real talent. The writing is really cool and the vocals of lori and micah rock(not to mention the cool music) I also heard that they have a new cd coming out which i'm sure is amazing. Anyway they rule!
3,Crosley CR38,"I got this radio a few years ago and it has the look of a 1936 Sparton Model 558 for sure, not the 557 like mentioned in another review, totally wrong Model. C.D. cover never worked right from the start, but as I really did not need a C.D. player, no big thing. The dial light bulbs (4) lasted maybe a year, then one at a time they went dark. Well I like the dark. Now after one year ten months the Auxiliary on it has a loud hum. It looks good, but lacks any quality I feel. Think I will try the old tube stuff this time. (Some) New stuff seems like junk."
5,"The best of the old , and the best of the new!","This says ""Queen Mary"" all over it. This is the ""Ultimate"" gift for the ""Ultimate Art Deco Fan"". I plan to purchase one, once the money becomes available. Keep up the good work on this website."
1,"oooh, hollwoods at its greatest !! BEST MOVIE EVER","syke. yeah - i said syke. cause this movie sucked. i love how it referenced to parts of american psycho part 1 that didnt even exist - and that it actually conflicted with the original film. take some director with an almost recognizable spin off of a famous name (morgan J freeman) - mix him in with 20 days of filming and a budget of 3 million dollars - put it straight to video and then throw in some hollywood magic (ie blood, underlying messages to women, and captain kirk) and there you have it."
1,Just write off this garbage of a movie.,"I remember when I was a kid I watched the famous Mel Brooks movie ""Spaceballs"". At one point in the movie, Yogurt (one of Brooks's characters) says to Lonestar ""Soon we will all meet up again in ""Spaceballs 2 The Search for more Money"". I think that is the best way to summarize American Psycho 2. Don't waste your time or your money and just watch the first one with Christian Bale. Bale is light years ahead of Mila as an actor and besides it's just too difficult to take her seriously after seeing her in ""That 70's Show"" and her role in ""Family Guy"" as Meg."
4,Interesting and refreshing to the first AP,"Alright, I see this review outnumbered by all the low reviews, but to me, it was pretty good. I found the movie typically aimed at younger audiences somewhere in their teens. It didnt't really have much to do with the original American Psycho, except a brief appereance of Patrick Bateman. Beyond that, it was a whole new storyline. If you give this moive a chance, you will find it satisfying. It just that I think it should have been given a different title like The New American Psycho or Patrick Bateman's Legacy so people will stop comparing it to the first one. If you like teen flicks with horror spiced with humor, then you will definitely find this enjoyable!"
2,Doesn't do justice to the original movie and book,"This movie is mildly entertaining, but doesn't have the punch of the original. In fact, it really doesn't have any justification as a sequel. If it had been made as just another teen horror movie, it would have been okay. As it is it is a half-assed attempt to cash in on the name of the original, offering nothing new. It is a sequel in the same way that American Werewolf in Paris was a sequel to American Werewolf in London."
1,as movie says .... the burning question is why???,"the first movie was based on self interest and greed of the eighties. and you were never sure whether bateman was or was not a serial killer. it was an excellent book made into a good movie.a summary of this movie is as follows - we follow a girl on her journey to reach quantico. people standing in her way are removed - and thats it.this movie, with a very tenuous link to the first, leaves you in no doubt this is no sequel. its awful purely awful. more in the scream genre than american psycho.near the end the movie the main character says,"" the burning question is why????""and i must confess i agree with her - why was this film made?bring back bateman.bring back bateman.bring back bateman.bring back bateman.P.S. you must see my new business card its on egg shell with raised type."
1,What a crap !,"Sorry but there is nothing positive I can say for this movie. Is the director get paid to make such a crap ? Is he really a director ? How do the producer/director get the money for it and how come distributors are interested in it ? The main actress is full of xxxx and mainly the other actors of this piece of xxxx are. American Psycho , the original, was something different, creatively made, and full of surprises so what happen ? Please do not think of American Psycho 1 in your choice to hire or buy this sequel because there is no relation at all !"
5,For the Love of Nancy,"Well, it would be nice for all the sellers to have the condition of the movie, whether or not it comes with all the printing. Some of the sellers don't have all that information. I'm adding this to my review in hopes of finding these four movies. I am looking for Seduction in a Small Town (1997), A Girl Named Sooner(1975), The High Price of Passion (1986), Triumph of the Heart: The Ricky Bell Story (1991)? I would like to have these movies. I haven't been able to find them. I am very satisfied with the service I have gotten so far ordering on amazon. I have gotten everything I have ordered before I was scheduled to get them, so I am very happy and satisfied. For the Love of Nancy was a very good movie. I highly recommend it."
1,does not fit,"The kit came with an at-65 antenna with an adapter that does not fit my roadmate 700. The magellan help line is ineffective. The Roadmate is nice, but this kit useless without the antenna. I wish I had not purchased this product."
5,BEST CHRISTMAS SONG EVER!,BEST CHRISTMAS SONG EVER! BEST CHRISTMAS SONG EVER! BEST CHRISTMAS SONG EVER! BEST CHRISTMAS SONG EVER! BEST CHRISTMAS SONG EVER! and don't you forget it.
4,Nikon Charger,Its a great charger and works great definently worth it but it needs to state that it has the cord with it so I didnt need to purchase a seperate cord.
1,Nikon battery charger,"1.Nikon MH-63 Battery Charger for Nikon EN-EL10 Lithium-ion BatteryI ordered the extra cord, because the description did not mention that the charger came with it.2. My battery does not fit in the charger - a little too large. How do I send it back??"
2,disappointed,"I am very disappointed with the Amazon description of this product. According to the description, the power cord was not included. I therefore purchased the power cord separately. The charger DID come with the power cord. I wish I had known this because now I have 2 power cords the trouble to return the extra one I ordered is not worth it. I am so disappointed. The description should have noted the power cord was included."
1,Do not order this,"This item worked as good as the broken one I already had. Yeah, it's cheaper then the ones you can buy in the store... but don't buy this one. Spend the extra money and get one from Home Depot or Lowes. I delayed my project 2 more weeks trying to figure out why I couldn't get my batteries charged up."
4,1Hr NiCad Charger,"Charger works great, unless you're in the hot sun, then it tends to not charge. Putting it in the shade seems to do the trick most of the time."
2,Not a quality product,"It does charge, however very very cheaply made. I have two batteries and one fits OK while the other is had to get in the charger, both are the same batteries. I never received a manual with the purchase and it is clearly stated it should have one. All in all I would pass on this charger, their are other alternatives."
3,Not for Firestorm batteries,"According to DeWalt, this charger doesn't work with Firestorm batteries. I can confirm that it doesn't work with either of my 9.6 volt Firestorm batteries."
3,Good $$$,"I would buy this product again, it has the best price compare with others supplies. Yes, I would recommend this to a friend."
3,DEWALT DW9116 7.2-Volt to 18-Volt Pod Style 1 Hour Battery Charger,"Well, before you buy it Google Dewalt DW9116. You will find that this is a discontinued product on the Dewalt web site. There was also a recall on this particular model. It could be a shock hazard.The instructions on the charger say to ""Read the instruction manual"". Guess what ? No instruction manual. No problem.... I'll just look one up online.wrong answer. Nothing out there.Item was received all scratched up in a postal bubble pack with no receipt or instructions. I would say that Hardware Sales Inc. gets a zero rating.Other than that, the charger does perform well. If you leave the battery in the charger overnight, it will automatically recondition it, and then go into a maintenance mode. It's a much better charger than the original cheepie that Dewalt sent with my drill combo. I am just hoping that the charging contacts dont pull out of the charger housing (subject of the recall)."
1,You have GOT to be kidding me!,"This product less than works. Instead of wasting your time using this product, just don't do anything and you'll have the same results. I love all of the Seventh Generation paper and feminine products, but I don't understand how people think their cleaning products work. They don't. Far more superior are the Ecover products. They all smell wonderful and do what they claim, fabulously. Now only if they'll come up with a carpet cleaner..."
5,Excellent!,"To think of Petra and the music that this group has put out is just ""Out of this World"". The music, message and lyrics are powerful (as usual). I recommend this album to anyone young or old who loves to turn up your music and are not ashamed to blast it to the car next to you."
2,"sad, very sad : (","the first rock band I ever heard was petra and I love them, there lyrics, music and concerts were the bast out there. but then when Bob laft the band I got scard, but ""no doubt"" was still an awesome CD, but there newist stuff! :( I mean come on whats up! it sounds like crap. all i know is they have lost 1,000's of fan by changing there music to this very cheap type of rock.:("
4,Good but not enough examples on DTS,"This is an overall good book on OLAP and data warehousing. It would have been better with more examples on DTS. The coverage of MDX, data cubes, and other topics is excellent."
3,Hawkwind - 'On Sundown' (Neptune),"Nice cover and all,but believe it or not,the same exact show that's on their 'Space Ritual II' CD.A brain damaging 64 minutes worth of vintage space rock that all us true Hawkfans have come to love,live for and uphold close and deep within our hearts.Sure,you all know the drill,""Space Is Deep"",""Upside Down"",the Nik Turner power-packed gem ""Brainstorm"" and the rest are here to play over and over and over until your mind is truly numb.Hey,who says old hippie music never dies?Well,actually it doesn't."
2,An interesting topic ground into the earth,"Very boring. A 20 page monograph puffed into a book. A few ideas, widely scattered through more detail about eastern european ethnic divisions and prejudices than you'll ever want to know."
4,This is a good debut solo album!,"Beverly Crawford's debut solo is really good. It is well-produced with well-written songs. One of my favorite songs is the beautiful ""Praise Jehovah."" My other favorite is the rousing title song. Then my other favorite is the hip-hoppish ""I'm Yours"", a song which should have gotten more airplay and one out of which she should have made a concept video. She deserved a Stellar award and Dove and Grammy nominations for this album. But I'm glad she won the Vision and GMWA awards."
1,A great disappointment,"I thought that this book will have all the info i'll need for my African cichlids aquariums, but this book is a total flop ,surprising with the names that were responsible for its release.It has little info on the life of the African cichlid of lake Malawi & Tanganyka and nothing else , it is mainly a picture book (more then 90%) WITHOUT any data on the fish in the pics.It seems i'm stuck with it but you can find much much better books to spend your money on."
4,different kinda Ibrahim,well rounded group plays with Ibrahim in a tastefull manner.this CD is for people who allready have heard other Ibrahim albums.recommended
1,Worst experience ever on amazon.,"Ordered on 8/14/2011 and was promised it would be here by 9/01/2011. This was to be birthday gift. Received a message from amazon on 8/31 that the product has not been sent. Called to find out whats going on, the lady that I spoke with said I would not receive it by the birthday and as a matter of fact it was not gonna be sent until 7 days after the birthday. That means it took them 25 days to send the product "" not receive "" send. I ask the "" lady "" if there is anyone that I could speak with to speed this up, and she said ( what makes you think that you are anymore important than the 1000's that are also waiting for their stuff ). PLEASE DO NOT USE SPORTSMAN GUILD. The product may be great, I wouldn't know , haven't got it yet."
5,Essential for every C++ Developer,"I love the book, to me it's like reading a novel, Bjarne's style is excellent and he answers all the questions that come to your mind while reading, he focuses not only on the language features but also how to utilize it to design better software.this is my third C++ book to read, and it's the best one I've read, but i wouldn't recommend it as a first book to learn C++ though, but you definitely have to read it at some point. It's worth it, no matter how experienced you are, you will learn a lot of things."
3,"C++ Programming Language, 3rd Edition.","Even though lots of people said this is a very good book. But my feeling about this book is kind of mixed: lots of material are covered in this book, however, the writing style is not quite accessible. It seems to me that Mr. Stroustroup is mumbling to himself!I learned C programming language by reading only ""the book"" by Kerninghan and Ritchie, and data strutures from Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming. But I just cannot learn C++ by reading only Stroustroup's book."
4,A tome,"1000 pages of admittedly well-written text about C++, without even discussing high-level APIs aside from the very basic STL, should be enough to convince anyone to move to Java."
3,Indispensable great book,"The reading is tedious, and in my opinion he does not cover some concepts thoroughly. It is a must-have, however, it's not perfect."
4,"Hands-on book, excellent reference","The master of 'em all, Bjarne Stroustrup. The C++ Programming Language is a wonderful intermediate-level reference book on the language.Be warned, this is not a tutorial. This has been written for those already proficient (or conversant) in the language. And for such readers, this is a treat.Unlike many other texts, this is a hands-on book. It requires a good deal of commitment from the reader, because it's not written in a way as to make you laugh every third line - believe me, it's a serious book.As for the content, you'll find that it is presented in a clear-cut and straightforward format that you'll love to read.My C++ shelf would be incomplete without this one. It's an excellent reference text"
4,A hard slog.,"I found this book extremely well written and detailed, but it was very tough to get through due to the never-ending accounts of mass murder. There is only so much description of shootings of women and small children that I can handle. Not to mention the 'efficient' way in which the Germans went about the Final Solution - particularly the 'sardine packing' method of mass killing.I won't be reading anymore holocaust books for a while as this one just about gave me nightmares. Who needs fiction when modern history can provide more that enough horror stories to turn even the hardest stomach.I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking a no BS account of the Einsatzgruppen and their horrific work."
5,Horrific expose of nazi culture,"I have read many books on the Holocaust, but none was so gripping as this one. While the horror of individual death is tragic, the complete eradication of entire villages, towns and cities is beyond belief. The cold, callous treatment of the Jewish people should never be forgotten or denied, and this book helps maintain their memory. I would recommend this book for any serious student of history."
5,this is much better than any Beatles anthology series!,"yes this deep purple ANTHOLOGY is much better than those beatles anthology series.I said better why? cause PURPLE rocks more than stones or beatles , you know? check out the whole set what DP is still playin on stage until today! the set like hush, you keep on movin, woman from tokyo, smooth dancer, sail away, getting tighter, burn, highway star are absolutely masterpiece. Because both of studio and live versions can be heard perfectly in a giant amp stereo. and deep purple presents their music in your sleeping room!this anthology version will absolutely not boring you all.....but the beatles anthology series are totally bored and indane.Love ya DP!"
4,I've looked everywhere!,"I had looked everywhere for this title. I had previously taped it off the T.V. many many years ago. Unfortunately the commercials were also on it. I am a preschool teacher and even though I played my copy every year, I hoped to find a VHS without commercials. I couldn't believe it when I found it at amazon. It came in good time and very good condition. Even though it cost me more than the cost of making it, it was worth it to me!I would definitely do this again."
4,Good review of grammar,This book is an excellent book for those students of Italian who have been out of school for some time and are a little rusty on English grammer as well. I find it very helpful for both English and Italian.
1,Returned Item,"I cannot review this item because I returned it. I did not receive this item until 12/24/06. Much, much too late."
2,I bought 2 pairs of this radio,"i bought 2 pairs of this radios and 1 of the pairs have a damage radio, the microphone dosen't work and i cant fix it!! :(im sand about it!!!!"
2,Poor durability and quality,"I have owned 6 of these keypads. I currently use two at a time with my three car garage set-up. The keypad itself is made very cheaply. After a few months the face where the buttons are start to crack. The area that attaches to the hinges that hold the faceplate always break (so i have to use superglue). Otherwise they function perfectly for me, but I am always replacing them before the year is up and we don't use them that often. If you can avoid using these keypads I would try something else, but i'm kinda stuck with this set-up since my garage door opener works just fine. Thanks and God bless."
3,"Good Remote, Cheap Plastic",The plastic cover broke on mine. My other keypad:Chamberlain KLIK2U Clicker Keypadis made with much better and thicker plastic.
4,"Good Quality Product,",These are very good quality and will purchase again.Confortable and cool too the feet.
3,Be Warned,"These socks are not bad, but not of the same quality of other Gold Toe men's socks. First, the socks rise only to the mid-calf level. They also fall down quite a bit. This is unlike the full calf size Gold Toe socks that actually stay up all day. I know some people do not like the full length socks in which case you may enjoy this item. But, if falling down socks annoy you stay away from this sock."
5,Best Socks Ever,"As a child, my dad wore these socks, and I would steal them because they felt so good on my feet. Now I buy them for my husband, and he also loves them. They feel great on your feet. He cannot get enough of them."
1,Not what they used to be,"I have been wearing gold toe socks for about 15 years now, but as other folks have pointed out, they don't seem to last long at all anymore. They don't get holes, but the heal seems to wear away pretty quickly (I just use them for work, no running or anything) I did notice that with this last set of socks I bought that they are no longer being make in the USA. I think they may have changed up the material being used at the same time."
5,The Best of Andy Rooney!,"The Best of Andy Rooney, well that should just say it all right there. He is a journalist missed by many of us. Yet this dvd will bring him back to life."
4,Print without the computer,"This printer is exactly as advertised. This device will print 2x3 inch prints on polaroid film. The quality is typical polaroid instant prints that we've all seen. It's easy to load the film and the nice thing is that the film pack provides the power, so you don't need any external power. If your digital camera has a print option, this printer will read that and allow you to print just those pictures marked for printing--quick and easy. If not, it's still easy to use. You just need to know what picture number you want to print. It's easy to quickly scroll through all the prints on the memory card. Pressing and holding the scroll button on this printer quickly advances through the prints on the memory card. The price per print is a bit high...I wouldn't pay the original price for this, which was over[$]... Without the rebate, it's ok if you want to print pictures away from your computer."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I was initially very excited about this printer which I purchased to take with me on a vacation to Europe. I could not have been more disappointed. I rationalized as a temporary glitch the fact that the printer jammed the very first time that I used it, but then realized that this printer jams about 50% of time, resulting in a fix (yanking out the cartridge & film paper) that wastes the expensive [...] paper. A couple of days ago I successfully printed 8 photos (a miracle), but they all had these burn markings on them (from the cartridge?). Tried to print 8 more photos & ended up yanking about $7 worth of film out of the machine to fix jams. Giving Polaroid the benefit of the doubt, we could say that I just got a ""lemon"", however 3 weeks ago when I first ordered this there were only about 2 or 3 used models available, as of this writing there are 6. If I can't return this thing, I certainly won't try to sell it to the unsuspecting public..."
5,Wonderful way to bring Christmas Spirit!,"We love this CD, we actually bought several for gifts after we received ours!"
5,Sisterchicks Down Under,I loved this book. Robin Jones Gunn is quirky and witty with kernals of truth scattered throughout like chicken feed!
1,kill joy 2,"Possibly one of the worst movies , but it will definately make you laugh alot , only good if you need a laugh"
3,Interesting game,"I bought this game for my girlfiend since she said she use to play it all the time. She was not joking, she plays it quite a bit for a girl who does not play many videogames. If you keep in mind that it is an old game, then you will have fun with it."
5,One of the best of the year,"In few words, Nolf is one of the best games I ever played. Great graphics, great sound and the game have a history that sit you down for a while tying to advance all the game. Maybe the game needs a lot of resources from your PC, but who cares...You'll find levels with different difficults and missions to do, with great scenarios and different enemies. A real spy game in the 60's.To finish, you only need to buy this game and help Cate Archer to save the world, and the space too."
5,great muffler for GMC safari van,"Great muffler for GMC Safari/Astro van. no lifetime warranty but for the price it perfect, easy install, great for the do it yourselfer, just use all new parts. dont mess around with the rust, not worth it. complete exhaust system from cat back is about $110. and 40 min install if done with all new"
3,Furnace Filters,"Filters are okay, but would liked to have had them packed in a plastic bag along with the cardboard box. Expensive"
1,Scaring !,"Scaring, disgusting ... what crazy vision of the world ?Yes why not attack North korea, tomorrow Iran and finish by France (our old friend) !Please don't vote for them. I think they're bipolar or insane ."
2,Another neocon iniciative to rule the world,"First of all, I've actually read the book. Boring, all ideas have been already written and the authors gives nothing new to digest. Another We have to go to north korea, and to Iran and be more agressive with france and saudi arabia, etc... They want to export the latin policy of the cold war to the middle east and asia.Their description of this countries are far from accurate and they don't seem to understand their population either.( Basicly: they are begging the US to come liberate them).They also have some good points. They underline the fact that all current organisations are from the cold war and must be transform to this new era.I'm not not shocked anymore with this neocon books, which is bad as they are an amount of atrocity too great to list in a review."
1,"Astonishingly arrogant and ignorant, a window into new evil","It is hard to imagine a copy of this book that survives more than one reading - I threw the book against the wall on many occasions with a John McEnroe cry of ""You cannot be serious!"" As a recipe for getting US sons in uniform killed, for killing innocent civilians in half a dozen targeted countries and for further alienating the US and endangering its citizens - it's perfect.How people with such muddled thinking come to power and prominence is amazing in and of itself, that they stay there is miraculous. If this disgusting book achieves anything, it will hopefully expose them to a wider audience and take them out of paranoid, self serving think tanks. I think we have found a Henry Kissinger for the new millenium (unfortunately Mr Perle would probably take that as a compliment)!Apart from all that, I liked it!"
2,"Mildly entertaining, pedestrian authorship","Regardless of party affiliation, a sophisticated reader will find the following in this latest Perle masterpiece: four typos; dozens of unsubstantiated claims; a perspective on terrorism that is blatantly one-sided and simplistic; five key errors relating to intelligence matters (NSA, DIA readers should easily spot these); and egregious omissions as to Perle's true corporate and quasi-governmental affiliations. Even if one ignores the biased perspectives, arguments presented by Perle represent literary mediocrity--at best a blue-collar manual to terrorism."
1,Where is the 'shared sacrifice?',"What I find lacking in this book is any mention of `shared sacrifice.' Here we have two high-income individuals who make their profit from other's misfortune, not once do they say what the well-off will do to be included in the `sacrifice' other than writing books.The point I am trying to make is that once again we have privileged individuals (Frum and Perle) who have not sacrificed or served in the military telling what we (I served in the military) have to do to fight terror.The day that Frum and Perle put on uniforms and pick up weapons is the day I believe in their self-serving message. This book gets one star."
1,Open your Eyes and Try to Use your Brain,"This book is Propaganda! That's not information, that's uninformation!"
1,Screed from an ignorant bigot,"There is NO understanding in this bigoted polemic from the far right. Perle confuses his loyalties (Israel is assumed as primary in his loyalties. How many advisors to foreign governments and politicians are in the center of US power? The 'logic' is absurd for example apparently Jews killed in Argentina were cause for applying the Monroe Doctrine. And attacking Iraq must have been for Israel if this is representative of his thought.) Deserves negative stars. Appalling the level of dogma, ignorance, bias, blindness from this influential Bush advisor. This kind of thing and official support for it increase hatred of US policies and the US and increase the rate on injustices supported by US policies. Great recruiting for the extremes of the Right and Al Qaeda. Try Pat Buchanan's review in the Conservative for an interesting discussion at length."
1,Mein Kampf revisited,I actually read this trash in the library. It is obvious these guys have been studying the early years of Hitler. This book is so anti-American that if this actually came to fruition America will make the old Soviet Union look tame. It is clear that these guys are just a couple of nerds that have taken the game of Risk too far.
1,The End of Evil,"Pay attention America and read this book. What they are talking about will involve your kids and their kids if the policies proffered are pursued further. Iraq was only their Act I. These may be smart men but wasn't it the ""best and the brightest"" that brought us into Vietnam. These people have already miscalculated the Iraq situation. Ask yourself where we are going to get the people power and the treasure to do these things. Only madmen and armchair chickenhawks would suggest blockading North Korea (which by the way has a real army)--the loss of life there would be tremendous and using nuclear weapons would be out of the question in such a populated area. Wake up America before it's too late."
2,Metal wheels,The axles are to short and fall out of all my rolling stock. Pending resolution right now so stay tuned.UPDATE: Well they signed for returns but now they say allow up to 2 weeks. My first thoughts is why 2 weeks...lots of returns or return customer service is not a priority.
2,Missa Luba,"After reading some of the reviews, it must be the 1968 one I heard recently and desperately want. It moved me, unlike the samples I heard from this CD. I'm joining the call for a reissue of the Congalese 1968 version."
1,Warning - thanks,"Searching for a CD copy of the music I first heard as part of the movie of English public-school anarchy, 'If,' I was tempted to purrchase this but the reviews have warned me off. Thanks to everyone who has pointed up the difference between this pastiche and the orginal. I'll wait for Phillips to see sense."
3,Good but Confusing for Some,"This was a great sci-fi piece that I would recommend for a library. I don't know that I would assign it as a regular reading piece though. There are a lot of scientific terms and concepts that can get lost on some readers. However, if you have a reader who needs a different kind of challenge, this would be a good pick."
5,Pudge Ate A Prophet - A Big Fish Tale,This extremely colorful book is filled with unexpected unique illustrations. The additional characters in this book make reading it even more enjoyable than the story. The objectives and discussion questions included at the end of the book make it useful as an eductional tool for parents to help their young readers understand the story.
4,Poodle Clipping and Grooming,"Another grooming book for my collection. A wonderful book (although not a current 2006/7), it displays great pictures, explores and explains different clipping styles available for poodles. A great book for the beginner to gain more knowledge or a more in depth book for the professional. Black & White print."
1,Greatest Hits [IMPORT] The Deele,For one thing the Deele CD information was false. The amount of songs advertised were significantly less on the actual CD. Also Two Occasions was suppose to be the long version on the [IMPORT]. That's why I purchased the more expensive import. I have to say it was very dissapointing to discover that it was not the extended version of Two Occasions. For these two glitches only I give the CD a low rating.
3,Not for resolute students of algebraci/diff. topology.,"I believe the two existing reviews are over-ratng. True, the book is accessible to anyone without prior knowledge of topology/algebra, but the treatment is too ""elementary"". For example, the author doesn't even introduce the word ""mod 2 homology"". If you are resolutely to study algebraic (or differential) topology, this is NOT the book to ""study"". Try Bredon or Fomenko-Novikov or May. For the subject covered, look for the book by Stillwell."
5,Good deal and good service !,"I want to thank amazon and the french company for the good service .I'm very happy for this product and My father is happy too for his gift. Even if it was shipped from Paris , I have received my order on time. I strongly recommend this product !"
3,Good...Kinda,THis camera worked for about 2 months. After that time it started not working properly. I couldn't use the LCD and the Optical Zoom didn't work. But I left it sit for about 2 months and it worked...wat a phenominom. I thought the image quality was good for 2.3MP. I found the software confusing though. I hated also how it sucked up batterys and it used 4 batterys. Also it was pretty heavy. But overall it was a decent camera but had some flaws.
1,Some questions garbled or incomplete - fatal errors,"The program is easy to use, but there is one MAJOR problem. My computer is a Pentium 4 running Windows XP. I don't know if that has a bearing on it, but in every set of 10 questions or so there would be one question where the last part of the question was behind the first answer with no way to see it. Sometimes you could guess what the question was by the answers, but not always. About every third time I'd finish one set of questions, the program would have a fatal error and shut down. I tried to contact the manufacturer but never received a response. Also...now and then their answer would just be WRONG. I'd look it up in the med/surg book, or meds book, and it would be plainly, unambiguously wrong. I've unistalled it and am using Saunders instead, which is less easy to run, but not plagued by programming errors."
2,"Cute, but doesn't really work","It's very cute, but because of some defect, it doesn't rotate. The music is also iffy, sometimes it plays, sometimes not."
1,Awful,"In the world of cheap, poorly-scripted potboilers, this is one of the worst. Instead of a riveting true-crime story, the viewer is subjected to a pointless, boring, innaccuracy-riddled mess. Perhaps worst of all (in a film full of ""worsts"") are the silly, contrived ""thoughts"" of Speck as he sits in a dingy toilet stall getting high. Everyone connected with this pile of sewage should be profoundly embarrassed."
1,"Wish I had not bought this, total junk!","The pump looks great and works well so far but there are problems. The bottom edge is rough and poorly finished, the coating material on the bottom does not cover it. This causes rust stains on my kitchen counter. I will have to get a piece of rubber, cut it to fit and glue it on. I didn't realize this pump was a DIY project.UPDATE: Rust stains developed at every seam and edge, I had to throw it out. I will never buy any product from this company again."
2,Rusts too fast,"The pump looks nice at first and works fine, but it rusted around the top after only two weeks of use."
1,Only gave it 1 star because I couldn't give it zero,"A boring, pointless, disjointed mess. A couple of times I actually found myself asking, ""Good Lord, will this movie ever end?"" I kept watching, hoping for some kind of a redeeming twist or resolution, but there wasn't one. I know Rooney Mara was nominated for an Oscar for Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, and that's wonderful, but she sure does stink in this movie. Than again, so does everyone else. Yikes, what a fail."
5,I PITY THE DEVIL THE DAY YOU GUYS START ARRIVING IN BUNCHES.,This line near the end of the movie had always grabbed my attention because it is so odd. I had always thought that it was the kind of line Martin would write-oddly funny. I was suprised when I heard the line in the movie Ivisible Agent.
5,Unique Movie,"When this movie came out, I'm not sure many people got it. By taking clips from old movies and putting them together into a film noir story line, Steve Martin showed some original genius. A lot of the stuff he did in his early days was original and witty and Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid is one that grows on you over the years as you gain appreciation for what was accomplished."
4,Overlooked Martin,"Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid (DMDWP) is probably Steve Martin's most overlooked film. Coming at the time when Steve was still ""Wild & Crazy"", many were turned off by this movie. But this is actually one of his best. The seemless interplay between Martin and the great actors/actresses from the 30's and 40's is genius. Filmed in black & white, Martin plays a gumshoe detective. Rachel Ward plays the love interest. Filmed before computers allowed you to insert anything into a scene, the editing must have been a nightmare. But the end result is worth it. The comedy is dark and satirical. It is Martin's tribute to the great detective and murder mystery films of Hollywood's golden years. Best way to view this film; Wait till it's nighttime, stormy and have a large popcorn. This film is simply great entertainment."
2,not helpful because of its basicness,"This would be a good book for the very beginner or junior high student. The premise is that the mailman named Fred was so great because he provided personal service for the persons along his route. and thats about it. Provide personal service, really get to know your customers and your staff and you will become a Fred. Or a super person."
2,Great price ...mediocre picture,"In retrospect, I should've paid an extra hundred or so for quality. The pictures are ususally washed out or too dark. If you want to use flash, you will probably miss the photo opp because it takes so darned long for the flash to be ready.It is my first digital camera and I find this is pretty much a case of you get what you pay for. For (the price) you don't get much here. It'd make a good kid camera, though."
1,I must have lost my mind to have ordered a product before checking the reviews,"I did not buy this knife on amazon, i ordered it after i wacthed the TV commercials. please you all should learn from my mistake. I usually check a review online before purchasing a product but this time arround i was carried away with all the lies and make believe i saw on tv and then speedily ordered the uselss knives that were not better than the dollar stores knives. I am seriously regretting it, and it's causing me a headache.The knives are flimsy and can't even cut through a cardboard. It is just useless for the money i spent."
2,Lousy Customer Service,"We purchased these knives several years ago. They of course came with the 'we will replace them' guarantee. A couple of years ago they all started falling apart. The studs come loose and they separate. There is no way to fix them. We have about 70% of them broken now. We contacted customer service over a year ago and no one ever responded. We have been aggressively contacting them for the last two months and still no response. So, the facts are these...the knives are inexpensive, they will not last very long, you will not get a replacement much less a response from customer service, and you will get what you pay for. At the price offered it is not such a big deal to just order new ones as they really are not bad knives while they last. However it is the principle of the thing. They are lying when they tell you they will replace the knives. They will not. That is just bad business and lousy customer service."
1,rust???,"I got these knives as a gift a week ago, I ran them through the dishwasher only to find them rusted the next morning. I called ronco directly to address the issue, and they proceeded to inform me that the DO infact have a lifetime warranty, but I would have to spend $2.50 per knife to send them back. What a joke. The are very sharp but what use do I have for them if they are rusted? Horrible customer service, I would suggest paying the extra money on a REAL set of knives!! I had the same set of Hindu knives for over 5 yes that I paid less for and never saw rust!"
1,"Dishwasher safe?Yeah, right!","After the first wash, rust! Who would even want to use rusted knives even if you can get the rust out, no way! Buy something else!"
2,Pretentious!,"Most of the times, one would not be doing justice to a book by trying to describe it in one word. Nevertheless, in this case I am tempted to say that this book can be reasonably described by one word- maudlin. The author has gone way overboard in trying to describe the feelings experienced by the Indian immigrants in the U.S. There is a pretentious sense of ""depth"" hovering in the book at all times. I cannot help but think of this as a poor attempt to emulate author Jhumpa Lahiri's excellent piece of work. I will give the author credit for nicely capturing a few genuine emotions, but the foolishly grandiose nature of the book more than compensates for the good points she scores."
4,A useful high-level view of XML and applications,"I thought this was a very lucid and easy to read account of what XML is, what it's being used for, and why you might want to use it. It clearly explains the relationships and differences between XML, SGML, XSL, and HTML. It also has a nice (but thankfully brief) treatment on some of the Microsoft browser plugins for rendering XML in a browser.Besides cutting through the mystery of XML, this book actually contains some useful software: 5 free-ware XML parsers and an eval copy of an XML document editor."
4,Sean McGrath is an excellent writer,"In my opinion, Sean McGrath is among the best technical writers out there. He is very good at distilling ideas to their essence and presenting them with impeccable clarity. This book is excellent as an overview of XML and a great starting point. You will want to buy other books besides this one to flesh out all the details."
2,not horrible,"How this book garnered 5 star reviews transcends the mystery presented here. I read the book from cover to cover, hence the two stars, but I certainly can't recommend it. How the protaganist (?) insinuates himself into the novels main relationships is also curious. The characters were unconvincing and the dialogues...well, let's just say the dialogues lacked credibility as well. And I'm curious as to how many times the word 'horrible' was used. I know there are synonyms out there. Stick to Highsmith and Ripley for more convincing fare."
4,Not bad for the price.,"They were new when I received them. The only thing wrong with them is my dvds and cds keep falling out. Everytime I open the case, my dvds/cds are all over the place and I have to keep putting them back in. Not bad for the price."
2,Cheap,The pages in this binder are cheap and they are attached cheaply. I will be surprised if this lasts six months.
4,Roach at His Most Melodic,"I've been listening to Steve Roach ever since I heard one of his songs on the third Hearts of Space Universe Sampler (a CD, which, is still in my top 10). I like just about all of his recordings (his dark ambient the most, and his tribal stuff probably the least). Structures from Silence is an album I heard relatively recently, and out of all of them, this is what I would consider his most melodic. It's an ambient album that takes a positive spin, without becoming sentimental with tons of uplifting-sounding washes. I enjoy it immensely, despite its receiving only 4 stars from me.The reason I only give Structures from Silence 4 stars is, although I like all three tracks on the album, I find that the third track lacks a certain cohesion with the first two.So, if you like a little melody with your ambience, try this out. Then buy Midnight Moon and The Magnificent Void, and then you'll have what I call the top trifecta from an ambient master."
5,Cry Freedom,"A greater and more important performance by Denzel Washington then Malcolm X in my opinion, this story which chronicles a reporters interaction with S. African civil rights leader Stephen Biko and the events leading up to and following his death. The end of this movie can drag on a bit, but the messages and historical dipictions of the corruption, racism, and cruelty of the apatheid S. African regime cannot and should not be forgotten. In my opinion this movie should be a manditory part of H.S. curriculums. To many youths of today know the word apartheid, but too little else. This movie is a must see."
3,Its ok,If anyone is interested in this period of S. African history I suggest reading both sides of this story. The movie is a bit more pro Biko than should be.
4,Feeling Younger with Homeopathic HGH,I was looking to get information on the subject of human growth hormone therapy. This book provided me with the information in detail that I was looking for.
1,Amazon made it right,"This Oscar de la Renta perfume is a fake. I have used Oscar for many years. This fragrance does not last an hour, not even a hint of it. Doesn't smell the same either. Conveniently, *sarcasm* it is not returnable.Amendment: I contacted Amazon about this perfume and I was issued a full refund. WOW."
4,Oscar De La Renta for Woman,"I have been in love with this scent for over 30 years, matter of fact it is the only fragrance I use. The spray bottle saves in longer lasting value. The price with amazon is the best you can get. It was packaged correctly and you can buy it for a gift or yourself. I do both mostly during Christmas gifts. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do."
3,wonderful.......many compliments,"I purchase this fragrance for my sister every year for Christmas, she always smells amazing. I'm sad it's so pricey though."
4,i had this alarm before,i have this alarm on my 03 s10 never really gave me a problem but does drain he battery if used alot i broke my remote on acident over the summer and was wanting to purchase a new remote but was wondering if i buy it from here if it gives u directions on setup to my original alarm anyone know???
5,nothing like it,"This is a very good item and it is just as it was described. I would recommend it to a ""T""."
5,"This book is genius, and has stood the test of time.","The Will of God is a book that is not overwhelming for a person that is suffering a great loss in their life. I have been handing this book out to many people that have suffered the loss of a loved one, or have had bad things happen in their lives, and it explains, without questioning the omnipotence of God, how God helps us deal with loss and how to help someone else. I recommend that every Christian buy this book!"
4,"Good value, Good speaker",This is a all around good speaker especially for the money. If you need really good bass though you'll need a subwoofer. If the price on these is what you set for your budget I don't think you'll find a better choice.They look exceptional and fit really nice aside the tv stereo rack without being overwhelming in size.
5,Excellent sound,"I'm using this with an Onkyo TR-606 alongside a Toshiba 62"" DLP HDTV and a full set of Polk speakers, and the sound quality is remarkable. I have four of these for the four corner speakers and they do great both in music and movies and TV, with excellent separation."
5,"Satisfying classical listening, especially with subwoofer","I purchased these along with the PSW 10 subwoofer to use with a TEAC Reference Series tuner and CD player. I listen almost exclusively to classical music, and what I was looking for was a concert-hall sound. Without the subwoofer, the bass was too cloudy for my taste, especially the lowest notes on piano recordings. Once I added the sub, I am extremely satisfied. The sound is amazingly realistic, precise, rich, and warm. For a combination under $1,000 this is an excellent sound. I wish I had put this together years ago! --If you're using these near a television or computer (which I'm not), opt for the PSW 12 subwoofer that has magnetic shielding the PSW 10 lacks."
4,Very good! decorative and gets the job done,"unless you are an aspiring chef or have allot of money to throw around, i do not see why you should buy a 100$ global knife - this is a very nice, balanced and sharp knife, i'd reccomend taking the change you have left from buying the cheaper knife and getting a good sharpener (and you will still have change) and sharpening the knife every so often thus getting an always sharp knife for half the price of a fancy chef's knife that will eventually get dull..."
3,Makes a mistake about Bruce Lee,When describing Enter the Dragon it claims the film is Lee's first speaking English. Wrong! Lee spoke english before in a movie he made with James Garner and Caroll O'Conner a few years before. Good enough book outside of thsi though I disagree Brando was so ultra-great in On the Waterfront and bad in Superman.
3,Amityville haunting,I didn't think this movies great not like the other Amityville movies it cuts out in parts like the wee lad with the camera that's why I give it 3 stars. Charles
5,very funny romantic comedy /drama,"very funny movie, a must for your dvd collection! it really makes you think about spending money, its a good chick flick."
5,A COMPLETE LAUGHFEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"even this movie was not very well known it is still one of my favorite movies in my dvd collection and of all time. here is a little lowdown on ""perpetrators of the crime.""3 would be kidnappers, Phil, Ed and Jones decide to kidnap a girl by the name of Pauline Henderson. Pauline comes from a wealthy family. the money they are supposed get from Mr. Henderson (Pauline's dad) which is one million dollars wouldn't even make a dent in his bank account. so during the kidnapping they figure out they've got Lucy.the wrong girl. Lucy seems to be perfectly nice and normal just as long as she's taking her medicine. Oh did i mention the kidnappers left the medicine behind.So i would recommend thin movie to a serious comedy lover. It is worth the money. trust me!!!!!!!!!"
5,"TOMMY BOLIN was in the top form, MK IV Purple formula","Tommy Bolin was in the top form, Mark IV Purple line up was still strong. this line up was not bad,...Bolin was a young hihg talented super guitar priest, replaced Blackmore in 1975. The result here is brain melting, God knows, how many excellent shows did Bolin give on this show. Tommy Bolin had a capability,...in some songs Bolin played much more heavier than Blackmore. BURN! WITH DEEP PURPLE FOREVER!"
4,Murphy's War,"Though I don't blame Murphy for his obsession, this movie hits the target for end results when obsessed by revenge. I had (Worn out) the movie on VHS."
4,Murphy's War,The dvd is in excellent condition as it should be since it is NEW. An all time favorite of mine!
5,Murphy's War dvd,"saw this movie at radio city music hall when it first came out, great acting, good old movie, they do not make them like this anymore,"
3,Ripoff of African Queen,"Peter O'Toole does a good job acting, but the movie is an adaptation of The African Queen. Good anti-war ending."
1,very sad,"Someone below complains of grammar books that proscribe in all cases ending a sentence with a preposition and splitting an infinitive. (I don't mean grammatical cases--never mind.) He is arguing with a straw man. I've looked through a fair number of grammar and usage books, none of which proscribed these (in all cases). This book goes much, much further. In effect, it tells you to do whatever you damn well please. You may well wish to do whatever you damn well please, but you don't need a book to tell you; just do it.Let's consider an example of its ""persuasive argument"": It's all right to say, ""Where's it at?"" this book asseverates because ""Where's it?"" would sound funny. That's its argument--I'm not making this up. This is my argument: It's not all right to say, ""Where's it at?"" because ""where"" means ""at what place"", and thus 'Where's it at?"" is equivalent to ""At what place is it at?"" Too many ""at""s. Yes, ""Where's it?"" sounds funny, so say ""Where is it?"" instead."
3,Comment on the Editorial Review,"On a book of such purport, it would be really nice if someone paid attention to the editorial review and corrected the grammatical mistakes. I read the editorial review while surfing and was quite amused. I have not seen the book yet so please ignore my rating. I could not avoid entering the rating and I am sorry if it skews it. If I read the book, I will correct the rating."
5,cute and classy,"I bought this watch for my for my 57 year old mother, who's a huge tinkerbell fan. She owns alot of ""kid-like"" tinkerbell watches and I thought this would be a nice, grown up, alternative. She really likes it and wears it to work as well as when she goes out on the town. She's always being complimented on it. The only problem I have with the watch is that the watch is smaller then it looked online, but I still think it's a great watch."
5,good book to have,"This book is really good. I was skeptical of buying it, but when I saw it in the store I realized this was a book I should have in my collection. It really does help explain how to make a wedding cake and in the back there's pictures of examples of wedding cakes and how to decorate them. Great to have."
4,Not what I envisioned,"When i saw this book as well as the reviews I thought the book contained lots of pictures and instructions, but to my dismay it was not like that at all.However the instructions and suggestions were great when it came to measuring ingredients, storing cakes I apppreciated that a whole lot."
3,Book is not strong,"I love the recipes, the pictures, but the book was poorly put together.My pages are all falling out of the book."
3,Cake Book,This was not what I was expecting. It is for a beginner. Very basic. It does have good ideas for a beginner. And it does show that a person with no decorating abilities can make their own wedding cake. It just won't be real fancy. Which is what I was looking for.
5,Snoochie Boochie!,"If you have ever needed a good laugh, I strongly recommend Mallrats. Even though many people say it is dull with no plot it is hysterical. It is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. When Brodie and TS first enter the mall the laughs begin and they don't stop until Shannon Hamilton(Ben Affleck)is brought down in the end. Get out and rent this!"
3,funny and well written but laging is some areas,this one was the weakest of the whole Jay and Silent Bob bunch because there were some areas that were laging from Smith's first film Clerks and it felt like a dissapointment. though Jason Lee and Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith get all the laughs. Ben Affleck seems a little bit butchcut and a little bit annoying. Jeremy London is ok but is outshun by Shannen Doherty who rocks also. Clair Florani is just wasted and seems miscast and Michael Rooker seems like the kind of guy you just want to see put in the gas chamber if you ever met him. strickly for fans
3,A decent movie - but Dogma is better!,"Mallrats introduces us to Ben Affleck... and of course Jason Lee in his first of many roles in the View Askewniverse. It also introduced ME to the term ""dirt mall"" which i now gleefully designate the Nanuet Mall in Nanuet, NY as (an abandoned shell of its former self!). Not a bad movie, the game show part of it is pretty dumb. Still, ""fly fatass, fly!"" is not something i'll ever forget!"
5,a kickass movie,"this m,ovie was great it was the best of Smith's movies and my favorite movie and the DVD specials like deleted senes mak it even better it even has a different begining u can watch that is better than the one they put in"
5,Snoochie-boochie-noochies!,"This movie is so funny! It follows the misadventures of two guys (Jason Lee and the very yummy Jeremy London) during their day at THE mall after they were both dumped under very different circumstances. Along the way they run into the super slick retail store manager (Ben Affleck) who has already made a move on Lee's ex-girlfriend (Shannen Doherty).Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) make their triumphant return and get the screen time they deserve. They beat the crap out of the Easter bunny and try to defeat the security guard from hell to wreck the game show that is being staged in the mall.I don't see why this movie is bashed, it is hilarious from beginning to end. Buy this movie, you will not regret it!"
3,How Mallrats could have been better...,"It should have been more like Clerks. What made clerks so good was the witty, unbathed dialogue. The best moments in Mallrats aren't the Silent Bob and Jay slap stick, or the Animal House like bad guy subplot, it was the superhero baby talk, the stink palm,and the criteria for a food court talk. These scenes are what makes Kevin Smith so great and unfortunately are not enough in this movie. Why is there a bad guy subplot? This subplot turns a movie that should be a smart crack at the cliches of the Mall generation and their relationships, to a 'b' movie with some great scenes. I'd love to see Kevin Smith redo this movie (hey Lucas does it) and Loose the bad guy subplot, have the movie get deeper into mall generation views and relationships, and bring back the EA sports NHL hockey game!! The dvd extras are terrific and make it a good buy."
3,2 thumbs up,"My friend and I (who are both 14) thought the movie was hilarious, with the exception of the topless fortune teller. That was tasteless. Brodie was the funniest thing I've seen in a long time."
3,Blu-ray is NOT the extended edition.,"So I imported the Blu-ray edition from Amazon UK (it's the same as what is offered here) and was disappointed to find that this is not the extended version, and there is little-to-nothing in the way of extras on the disc. I'd recommend just waiting for an official release from Universal, who has been late to the Blu-ray party but playing catch-up the last couple of years, and hoping they do better than this."
4,Great shipping,"Shipping came within a week, even with the supersaver shipping. would use them again."
3,Book rubbed me the wrong way on Rev. Shuttlesworth,"I purchased and read this book for a Civil Rights class that I took which focused on the Civil Rights movement in Alabama. Fortunately I was exposed to the movement's highlights in many forms of literature and multimedia, thus not seeing only one view of events. This particular book was my first introduction to the Rev. Shuttlesworth, and I was vastly disappointed in the way the book portrayed the Reverend. I think the authors over compensate for the lack of attention given to Shuttlesworth in mainstream Civil Rights pieces, trying too hard to compare his actions with other leaders. I was put off by the descriptions, which seemed to try to discredit the other leaders.Thankfully, later in the class I was reintroduced to Shuttlesworth and I took away a much more positive view of him and his contributions to the movement.I would recommend reading Parting the Waters and Pillar of Fire by Taylor Branch instead of this particular selection."
3,Absolutely FANTASTIC product for AfriAmer natural hair!,"I have beautiful kinky hair. This product is awesome because it combines two things I want most: moisture and definition. Before, I had to apply gel and a moisturizer, but this cream does both and doesn't have to be applied daily. I use it after a fresh wash leaving my hair with defined waves and curls. Just as great on dry hair.This would be perfect for little nubian princesses!UPDATE: I ran across my earlier review which prompted me to adjust things a bit. Late 2009 or so, the formula for this hair lotion changed for the worse. It went from being a rich paste, to a watery lotion. As a result, it has to be used more frequently for less-remarkable results (which includes frizz as mentioned by another reviewer)."
1,not a good choice,"I picked up a box of these nails locally for a job I am doing. I was using them in a genuine paslode hanger gun and they did not work well. It seems like the angle of the nails are not correct, and the little clip on the slide of the gun would not engage the heads of the nails. So they would not feed consistently. This would be expected in a generic nail or gun, but not using a Paslode positive placement gun, with paslode nails.For kicks I did load them in my bostich PP gun (nail box says they will work) without much better results. The paper that is used to collate them is too high and too thick on the nail for the bostich nailer, and drags on the magazine creating some of the same problems. I ended up grabbing a box of generics and they worked fine in both guns.Not sure if I just got a bad batch, but don't feel like spending another $75 on nails that don't work correctly in any of my guns to find out."
3,For WWII History Buffs,"The quality of the production isn't the best, but if you are a World War II history buff, you will love this DVD."
2,Lousy Movie,"I must not have researched this movie enough before buying the DVD. I was immediately surprised by two things: (1) it's in black & white (the colored cover is deceiving) and (2) it is a French film that is mainly spoken in French although dubbed in English. The big problem with the movie, however, is that it just doesn't flow right. It bounces around too much and is not focused enough. It's just not very interesting, although it recovers some toward the end when the allies entered Paris. My 2-star rating is based on the interesting ending (it was 1-star up until then). I must say that the black & white nature of the film allowed the film-makers to blend in historical footage of Paris during that time period. Much of the ending, for instance, was historical footage of the victorious walk down the Champs-Elysees. It's a long movie, and the wait for the moving end wasn't worth it. I'll probably not watch this again."
3,One dedicated to The Resistance,"Although this movie fails to fit the classic 'war film' category, it still has some decent battle scences and pays tribute to the French resistance who played such a vital role in the defeat of Hitler's Nazi war machine. On the down side, i thought the acting was a little ordinary in comparison to other films of its time ('The longest day', 'The train' etc)and at times became a little long winded. It did have a great soundtrack and overall was a film worth watching."
5,brilliant! the most cutting edge sci-fi since JFK,this movie captured the essence of Asimov perfectly. when i first saw it i was blown away by the state of the art rotoscope techniques used to create the magnificentelements of the film. i would reccomend this movie to any fan of battlestar galactica or lorenzo llamas.
5,A tour de force of the power of the human mind,"I would first like to say that the review writen which begs you to consider how ""lukey"" you are is one of the most disgusting things I've seen voiced on the Internet and I'm amazed the person had the capacity to enjoy this movie, although I am certain they enjoyed the thought of Lorenzo getting so sick, as apparently they wish the poor to get on their knees to them and view this as some sort of virtue.For those of you in the world who still believe the human mind is not helpless and useless in the face of tremendous challenges, buy this movie. It is a powerful work that screams to its viewers never to lose hope -- and never to place your fate in the hands of faith. Go to work. Learn. Take yourself to your limit, and push beyond it. If Lorenzo's parents had simply set back and waited for divine intervention, or had waivered in the faith in their own minds, their son would be dead. Instead they showed the great things that can be achieved by man."
5,Lorenzo's Oil,I ordered this item for a 6th grade class. This DVD was just as I expected and was recieved very promptly. I would order from this here again.
3,Preventative Maintenance,"This coffee maker brews coffee well, the taste sustains and the coffee remains hot for several hours. However as its manual instructs, to avoid an overflow it is advisable to run a vinegar/water solution through it at least once a month. Second, using finely ground coffee will invariably cause an overflow. Good luck!"
1,Price wrong?,What am I missing? reconditioned for $191 or brand new for $99?????? Are these people crooks?
4,"A sweet, hot Christmas book.","- ""The Proper Lover"" by Eileen WilksSet in Regency England. Emily, a young lady plans to lose her innocence to James, a charming rogue, so that she doesn't have to marry against her will, but she doesn't expect a night of passion to so thoroughly connect their souls...- ""Santa Wears Spurs"" by Kinley MacGregorSet in the Old West. An outlaw returns to the woman he loved and left behind because he wanted to protect her from his own brother, and finds the best christmas surprise of his life...- ""Christmas Bonus"" by Lori Foster(My favourite!!!) Erin Bragg had been in love with Maggie Carmichael for years. He had been waiting for her to grow up before making a move, but she was his boss now and if he asked her to marry him some might assume he was only doing it to get the company.- ""A Night with Emily"" by Dee HolmesJohnny and Emily were forced to spend Christmas together and they found out that their old flames still burn white-hot..."
4,"An Original, Pure And Simple","Jorane's album is original, inspirational and lovely. The vocals are beautiful while the lyrics are slightly loopy and poetic at the same time. The version of Donna Summer's 'I Feel Love' is a wholly new imagining of the song and quite possibly the highlight of this recommended work. Perfect for a rainy afternoon."
1,"DVD does NOT contain ""Birth of a Legend""!","Substantial misrepresentation by the seller! This DVD does NOT include ""Birth of a Legend"" as listed here! I've seen small clips of ""Birth of a Legend"" and loved the wonderful CGI work there - such as the sequences of Titanic on her sea trials - and was so excited to see that it was to finally be available on DVD and immediately ordered it. How excited I was to have this arrive early. And what a complete and thorough disappointment to see that I didn't get what was advertised. The DVD is a compilation of re-enactments titled: 1)Curiosity - What Sank Titanic, 1) Titanic - The Investigation Begins, and 3) Last Mysteries of the Titanic. It is going back for a refund."
1,Disappointed - why no Birth of a legend?,"I was really looking forward to seeing Titanic - birth of a legend again. It was first screened on British TV but not repeated, and is not available on UK format DVDs so I was thrilled when I spotted it on Amazon.com. Like other reviewers it came as a great disappointment to discover that this excellent documentary drama is not included despite information to the contrary. I am returning my DVD as this was my sole reason for purchase. Another time I'll wait for the first reviews to appear before ordering."
4,A different kind of Christmas album!,"An instrumental Christmas album that is very nicely done. What makes this different is that it is done in a caribbean style with steel drums and all. While I'm not a big fan of steel drums, it works very nicely with a Christmas album. If you want something different to play during the Christmas season, this is it."
1,DISAPPOINTED COULTER LOVER,I HAVE ALWAYS LOVE CATHERINE COULTER. BUT THIS IS THE MOST BORING BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. THE CHARACTERS WERE RIDICULOUS. THE PLOT WAS FARFETCHED.(I HAD TO FORCE MYSELF TO FINISH IT.)DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS ONE. I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED COULTER'S BOOKS BUT I WILL THINK TWICE BEFORE I BUY ANY MORE OF HER BOOKS. ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH FOR THIS ONE!
1,Not a good read,"This was my first Coulter novel and it will be my last. The dialog was forced, the plot silly, and the characters were never fully developed. Sorry."
2,Keep this in mind,"I feel sorry for anyone who picked this book up without realizing its written by a romance novelist (you know those books that have the half naked people on the front?). The dialogue and believability of the characters were on par with those in romance novels. I didn't find any of the dialogue remotely believable... a few times I laughed. Do people actually talk like that?After just finishing ""Deadly Decisions"" by Kathy Reichs, this book pailed in comparison. I don't read romance novels for the quality of dialogue and the character development.. if you catch my drift."
4,Suspenseful and full of twists,"I enjoyed listening to this book. Catherine and Iris are my favorites when it comes to Mystery Contemporary...It did seem a bit much at the end with the extra villain, but I still enjoyed the characters. BEWARE of the unabridged audio though, the reader did a horrible job with the male characters' voices. It was very distracting with the storyline, but the story itself is excellent."
2,Disappointed Fan,I have read all of Coulter's books and usually enjoy them thoroughly (at least 4 stars). This book however was a huge disappointment. The characters were never fully developed. There would be a hint of typcial Coulter humor/ personality and then it would fall through. I'm still a Coulter fan but this book did not live up to her standards.
1,Not Good at All-Couldn't Get Through It-Dumb!,"The beginning was fine. But after that, it all lost me. Becca has a stalker on her tail, so she takes off for Riptide Maine.When she gets there,she finds a house to buy and moves in, and it is there that she finds a strange skeleton in the basement.The story then just poops out from there.From that point, comes all these other characters that are strange. It makes you say, ""What?"" I couldn't find it worthwhile enough to even continue, and just quit. When you're reading and the story isn't making sense as this one didn't, why continue?Don't waste your money!"
2,"Aspiring Editors and Writers, there is new found hope!","This was my first Catherine Coulter novel, and though I tried and tried, the prose was simply too repetitive, mistake riddled, and quite frankly awful. Her character development comes off as if it were written by a 4th grader. Though Coulter has a creative mind in putting together a story, there were some pieces of the puzzle come together like trying to reconstruct a shattered whindow. With better editing, fewer ""Damnations"" and ""down to his/her toes"" the book would have been less frustrating to read. Many a suspenseful moment exist, with good ideas, ruined by the teller's plodding prose.At least at the end, the story answered it's few unanswered questions. I just wish it were put together more effectively and edited by a professional.I will give Coulter another chance, there has to be something to a person who can write several best sellers. Just not this one."
1,Ugh. Can't finish this book.,"Started kind of perky, then the trite treatment of small townsfolk went on a little long.Two or three paragraphs at night and I am sound asleep.Try reading Looming Tower, a history of Al Qaida. It is absolutely spellbinding and it tells the story of just how long these people have been planning against us...since the 1940's! I didn't put it down for an entire weekend. Last time I did that was when I read Gone with the Wind for the first time."
3,...,"I found this book to be an excellent read. I picked it up on the shelf at a Ramada hotel gift shop, thought it looked alright so i decided to give it a try. I'm not usually the kind of person to like romantic novels but this one had just enough romance to be good but not graphic. This story has more twists and turns then a 6 flags rollercoaster! all i can say is read it."
4,I thought it Was Good,I have read the other reviews of this book but I don't agree with the ones who did not like the book. I was hooked on the book from the beginning. It held my attention which is not easy to do. I recommend it to everyone who reads Catherine Coulter and authors like her.
2,Come Undone,"There are so many good things about this film, especially the two leads. However, as with so many gay oriented films, not enough care has been taken in the editing and plot development (the story goes right off the rails at the end). If this film lost 15 to 20 minutes it would improve dramatically. How about a re-cut guys?"
2,The cover is so misleading,"The cover for this movie makes you feel as if you are finally in a for great, happy, easy going gay film. Instead, it is one of the most disturbing gay films ever with nothing but depression and repressed gay feelings. I don't recommend this."
3,Not all that Exciting,"Starts out as a coming of age story and then quits, leaving no one happy, not even the viewer. Not that its a downer. It just doesn't live up its promise. The love scenes are weak and the ""nude on the beach"" scenes seems to have been photographed through a bongo blanket. Rent if you want to check it out before you buy it, but don't pay a premium price like I did..."
1,Root Feeder,"This product has the quality issues. Probe is not straight, the main body or washer has the crooked nut so the connection is not good.The manufactory want me to fix the bend by myself to viod the replacement.This is the bad purchasing experience I have had with Amazon so far."
2,"Yep, there's a noise...","The hub itself works fine. I've had it at least a year now and I have it maxxed out with 4 1TB drives and 1 500GB drive hooked up to it (which is another rip-off in itself - seeing how it's REALLY A 5-PORT HUB since you have to use one of the ports for the comp - what's up with THAT marketing hype? sheesh!). The whine (or squeal if you will) is actually louder with more devices. I would of sent it back, but I bought it on the road at some little computer store next to an airport and was thousand miles away when I discovered the ""feature."" SO when I got home I simply shoved it into a small padded case I had lying around and buried it in the cabinet under my desk. - end of problem. Been working flawlessly ever since."
3,Not Quite as Good Quality-wise as Volume 1,"Here are chapters 7-12 of the cheesy Bela Lugosi serial Phantom Creeps. Remember, the price of these Alpha titles should tell you something. The video quality here varies greatly from chapter to chapter. There are many scratches and the pictures jumps a little in places. This is a great serial and if you want a cheap copy, this Alpha version is okay. If you are a collector, however, wait for a better version."
3,Lugosi Destroys the Hindenburg!,"""The Phantom Creeps"" (1939) is 12 chapters of Universal serial hokum. In other words, it's a lot of fun. Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Zorka to the hilt - assisted by Universal's vast catalog of stock footage and classic music scores. The final chapter is particularly memorable, as mad scientist Lugosi gleefully brings down the Hindenburg. Universal did not make the finest serials, but ""The Phantom Creeps"" remains one of the studio's better efforts."
3,4 hours of adventure,This was a very good film. Bela Lugosi plays Dr.Zorka a mad man who wants to take over the world. The film goes on and on from Zorka disappearing to the government stealing his box of mystery. I enjoyed the film but I thought it was a bit too long!
2,"Should've told one story, not two","Very dissapointing. The premise, of creating a neural net that can pass a comprehensive English exam, is very clever, but the characters are little pieces of glib chatter, occasionally amusing, more often smarmy and annoying, and that love story, cold as ice. No one in this novel would be caught dead at the scene of an emotion. Clearly Powers is a smart guy, but the whole thing feels like a therapy-diary. File under ""Coulda been a contenda."""
2,Just a big stinking let down.,"I felt like the first hundred or so pages of the book promised a lot of truly vicarious devastation, but then I got to the end and Powers' had delivered nothing. This book is dullsville; read it and feel absolutely nothing during the story's climax. In all fairness, Powers writes very well, it's just that the content of this book bores me. Maybe my problem is that I was expecting it to be much more sci-fi and dramatic, and to me it read more like a semi-masturbatory litany of the sufferings of the author at the hands of his bipolar ex-girlfriend."
3,bought it for pets,"I have two Jack Russells and someone suggested this to calm them down. Who can tell, they are Jack Russells!!!!!"
5,Outstanding Product,"I would (and do!) wholeheartedly recommend this product to anyone dealing with stress, anxiety, tension-it really works."
2,Not So Sure It Works For Me,I bought this for occasional anxiety. I'm not sure if it works for me or if it's mere placebo effect.I personally think it smells like alcohol (booze) and feel a little self-conscious about my breath after I use thisas I do not drink and wouldn't want someone to think I had. I'm truly glad it works for so many others but I don't thinkI would purchase it again.UPDATE: I have since tried the Rescue Remedy Lozenges (Pastilles) in the yellow tin and they are Alcohol FREE and they work great for me. Try them if you had no luck with the liquid drops.
5,Remedy for Cats,"Bach Rescue Remedy is a natural and safe, as well as effective way, to keep a multi-kittte household very happy!"
2,Waste of money,"I saw this on Dr. Oz and figured I'd try it. Who doesn't have stress in their lives ? So there is an eyedropper in bottle. You use 4 drops and you are supposed to feel magically better. I can't believe I fell for this. It tasted like Whiskey. It is a dropperful of alcohol. That's it. If I am going to have a whiskey to calm me, I'd rather have a Jameson on the rocks. (jk)"
2,Had no effect on me,"This product was recommended to me by a friend who said it was ""God-inspired."" I found that it has no effect on me. I am currently under a lot of stress, but the Rescue Remedy hasn't helped at all. Now, it works wonderfully for my friend, so I think it just depends on how individual bodies respond to it. For me it didn't work, but for someone else, it might. I guess you just have to try it out and see."
3,repetitive but fun,the music makes you want to dance (ballroom dance) hence why i bought it. It's very uplifting.
2,Beware - Know what you buy,"If you think that the claims made by the manufacturer actually come through and you are purchasing high quality images, think again. Although they offer a money back guarantee if you don't like the collection (shipping is on you), all too many images are blurred by an ""artistic"" coating that makes them unusable. Then they show you the real image in tiny slides. If you really want the ""good"" picture, you have to go to their web site and buy it... There are some images you can actually use in the package, but not nearly as many as they claim! I found some 350 variations of ONE picture (1 easter egg). The search engine is really buggy, but they offer an update online."
3,Wait for Price Drop,"Thanks for your reviews. You just saved me $100.00. When people from different walks of life have the same opinion, the reviews speak for themselves. Thanks again!Gene"
3,"Not Bad, Not Great, Gimme A New Album.","This basically collects some of the B-sides from Dookie, Insomniac, Nimrod, and Warning. Unless you're a Green Day completist you really shouldn't worry about seeking this one out. It's not the great. For ever good song there's 2 that aren't that great. Here's the good stuff:1. Suffocate - Sounds like good ol' Green Day, Dookie style.2. Desensitized - Sound like it could have been one of the better tracks off of Nimrod.4. Outsider - A great cover of the Ramones classic.5. Don't Wanna Fall In Love - Fast Paced like a mofo. This song is probably my favorite on the album and probably would have fit best on Insomniac.7. I Want To Be On TV - Another great aggressive punk rocker that sounds like Insomniac-era Green Day.15. Ha Ha You're Dead - A nice Green Day sing along. Kids love this one.Get it if you really need it, otherwise leave it alone."
4,good b-sides,i got this cd with the intention of another cd to thier sound of what they sound like when they grew up on warning. but i was suprised to hear once again that good old green day almost punk rock that we all know. This cd has a mix of dookie sounding with some new green day sound from warning. Highlight songs are you lied which is one of the only oringanal songs of theres on the album might i add. the first song on the cd which is suffocate is a very cathcy tune it will have you singing for ever and it wont get out of your head. they also did over a classic the kink song tired of waitong for you. They did this perfectly. and they have a classic ramones song outsider as well which doesent sound so much as the ramones but still greatly done. another great and young song is i wanna be on t.v. all in all this is a good cd but not the best but if ur looking for some great catchy tunes to listen too buy this if not buy warning or dookie instead.
4,From the bizare to the sublime with many stops in between.,"As this book progresses so does Lotus Rose. He writes like a child with a thirst for knowledge, like a child he becomes corrupted through his teenage years and as he journeys into manhood one has to become worried for his sanity. He is so far twisted it is hard to see where the fantasy ends; leaving you thirsting for more and worried for your sanity, such is the style of his writings.I was saddened to see some of the stories end and hope that Lotus will soon be expounding on some of these wonderful, imaginative new concepts and ideas."
4,Fine book on feral cats,"I found this in a Bennington, VT bookstore after my wife Andi pointed it out and bought it right away based on a warm description of how loving a cat could be, even moments after killing and gutting a grouse. Berkeley does a wonderful job of showing that duality of cats, of how at once they're incredibly close to us they are as well as being close to natural hunting machines. Warmly written, funny and touching, she also fills out the book with very well-researched scientific info on feral cats, and cat populations. A must-read if you're a cat person and owner."
2,Difficult,"I am almost through with ""The BookShop"". I found the writing difficult to understand. The plot I found to be lame: her pressures of the art center, her young 10 year old helper, ""Lolita"" . . . I have not gotten emotionally attached to anyone in this book to say the least."
1,Depressing book,"I bought this book thinking that it would give me a good idea of what to do and where to go. After reading this book, I almost don't want to go to the big island! It's not only is hard to use, but almost every section I read told about how you couldn't get to some place it was talking about or that the place was to dangerous because of tide or locals. I suggest looking for another guide."
1,"Looks nice, but don't be fooled...!","Don't be fooled by the napkins they try to sell along side these on Amazon - THE NAPKINS DO NOT FIT! I'm totally frustrated they they are suggested to buy them together. I contacted Amazon and since it's a third party product they cannot provide a refund.I'm appalled that all these people had to have accidentally purchased these together, in order for them to show up in the ""buy these together"" area. Now I have to search around for matching ones with limited time to find them before my daughter's birthday party. Le sigh."
4,"nice, but...","I ordered both the white top and yellow cream top dispenser and learned that the cream color top does not ship very well. I feel both the Red and Cream paint used are lower quality than the same dispenser which has a white top.Amazon took one of them back and shipped another - the second one was not perfect either, but good enough to give away as a gift to someone who didn't care as much."
2,"Missing the punchline, a disappointment","The story is well written, but like the title, something vital is missing, without which it doesn't make sense. Things happen, but there's little progress after the situation is set-up.The characters are unusally low-key; in most other SF stories of this type, upon realizing that they are brainwashed by aliens, a character will try to resist; here they just shrug and go on with the alien plans.When I read the last page, there was no sense of finishing a complete story: we never do find out what it was all about, anymore than we find out what the missing verb was in ""why do birds""."
3,This book is not too good as a standalone for beginners,"In programming school we are using this book by itself, and it is very hard to understand for a beginner. Many things are just barely touched upon without giving concise examples. The appendices mean well, but there is no place to find centralized references to specific questions. If this is a person's first book on assembly language, I think he/she will find the need for another."
4,Very Practical and Useable Resource,This book was very helpful to me as a beginning teacher. I highly reccomend it to anyone who teaches writing for any subject.
5,Exactly what we Needed,"It is not easy to find a reputable dealer for this kind of product, regardless of how simple it is. Amazon should know - they had to cancel a previous order from a different seller. So, it's great that Amazon had this seller's shingle out there, and fantastic that they're nearby. We will need to use them again!"
5,Really Good Movie,"This movie is first rate and really fun. Not a big budget, but not needed to convey the story. Really good work by the actors and crew."
5,Good Family Entertainment,This miniseries movie 3 DVD set was produced during an era when the audience could get a good message about family values and feel good at the end. Most of todays movies either leave a person feeling down or are hard to understand because of some hidden message or agenda that the director attempts to convey to the audience.
2,Not Good,"Bought this phone a year ago, worked fine for a year and then started trouble. Gets disconnected while talking, cant hear what the other person says."
3,ok phone,"the speakerphones are the plus for this model. They are clear and loud enough and the other side can hear, unlike other panasonic 2.4 ghz models.the answering machine is also great and is very usefull.however there are problems with this phone.first of all its not spread spectrum. Perhaps that is why i dont seem to find the sound quality particularly clear (drawint to radio as an example: it sounds like an AM channel instead of FM).also the phone is slow.it seems to lag a little behind when i dial in the numbers.in addition, all the rest of my phones in my house ring at least once before this phone begins to ring, and if you pick up the phone too quickly (right when it rings for the first time), the phone is non functional for 2-3 seconds for some odd reason (i know this isnt a defective phone because i returned it for another and it did the same thing)."
4,Does The Job,The two most important features I was looking for was a speakerphone on the handset and a phone that used the 900MHZ frequency (so as not to intefere with my Linksys wireless network). This phone met both criteria at an affordable price. I highly recommend it.
2,Has broken twice in less than a year,"The handset sound quality is excellent and the caller ID works fine. The answering machine sound quality is marginal and it is quite difficult at times to hear exactly what the message says. The worst part, however, is that it has broken twice in less than a year. Very poor reliability."
1,Battery power sucks!,"I thought this phone was great when I first got it, but just a few months later I am now learning that the battery is terrible. Even if I do not use the phone all day, If I leave it off the base over night it is dead in the morning. I can not believe how bad this battery is. All the other features of the phone seem nice. It is a shame."
2,diconnects calls and battery dies,"This phone is not worth the bother. My sister and I both have one and have the same problems. The phone disconnects accidentally while you are talking, and the battery has a short life- needs to be recharged every few hours."
2,Ehhh,"Not one of my favorite Gerri Hill novels. I loved all her other books, but this one was too... unrealistic for me. Some of the things the characters say are just not things I see people saying. I guess it was just too mushy for me."
1,Very Limited Usefulness,"I took Aquatic Chemistry as a senior and had very little help from this book. There are few examples and there are no guided practice problems/solutions. That is good for the professor I guess since they don't have to worry about homework as much, but my chemistry books always have at least odd numbered problems with solutions and a solutions manual so you know whether or not you're doing the problems right. I would recommend against even thinking about buying this book."
2,Chemistry,"I would have liked more examples worked out, or at least the examples that were worked out to be better explained. The book seemed to make topics more confusing than they needed to be."
3,Just ok,"I bought 2 of these to replace my Infinity 125's that I have used and played hard over the years. I hooked these up to my Onkyo TX-SR806 and tried them on their own and they sound ok.But when I hooked up my old infinity SM-125's with the polk 70's and my old ifinity's blew away the polk's even with the foam blown out around the speakers. So, I'm not that happy with the polk's. I'm going to get my 125's fixed and put the polks in my bedroom with my old kenwood system."
2,Didn't last like it should have,"We had this phone for a year and used it a LOT. At first it had great distance and clarity, but it soon got worse and worse and the battery life got shorter and shorter. We both work from home and need a clear line, so had to buy a different phone to keep working. For what we paid for this phone, we expected a lot better durability. Also, I agree with the other reviews that complain about the number of ""keystrokes"" you have to go through to redial or dial a number in memory. Very cumbersome. I believe there are much better models out there for less money."
1,Works Great --- For the first few weeks,"When we first got this phone, it was wonderful! It worked fine - had great range, great sound etc. However, after the first month or so - it started having problems. It would say ""out of range"" even though you were standing right next to the base. Customer service gave some tips but these didn't really work. Ended up returning and getting a replacement (it was still under warranty). The new phone does the exact same thing. Now, the phone does not work at all. Several friends that have the same phone have also experienced this problem and others. I would not recommend this phone."
4,Solid phone that looks cool.,"I've had this phone for about a year. It gets great reception out of the condo building and around the grounds while I'm walking the dog. Built-in voicemail button works well with our telephone company's voicemail service. Plus the user functions are easy to learn.I haven' t had any of the paint flaking problems that the others have complained about in their review. Plus, I've been able to leave the phone off the charger for up to two days with light talking. In addition, my puppy managed to get to the antennae and chew a bit on the plastic and the phone came through just fine."
1,The Worst,"The absolute worst friggin' phone I have ever purchased. I had a Motorola cordless flip phone for about 6 years, and this piece of garbage lasted about 8 months. The paint started flaking off after about 2 months of usage, and ceased working just last weekend. Will never buy another Panasonic product again. If they can't get a simple phone right... just imaging a home theater system!"
2,"Beware No Mute, No Easy Ringer Off",No mute button? Isn't that illegal? How about having to drill down menu after menu to just to turn off the ringer? Otherwise the phone works great and sounds great. But these are biggies to me.
4,I like it better than most,"It's true, it's not perfect, but it doesn't cost a fortune either. There is no mute button, but I use the speakerphone to listen until I get off the endless hold of banks, tech support, whatever.. so that is not a problem for me. I like that I can use my headset, the handset OR the speaker. The sound quality is good. I set Line 1 as my default line, and I HAVE dialtone on Line 1 when there is no power. I have had the phone unplugged for up to an hour an NOT lost my settings, so I don't think that's all that much of a problem either. Yes, you have to be able to use a menu to set the ringer volume, but once it's set, I leave it, so again, no problem there. For me this phone was a good value for the money, and I am happy with it."
3,Not bad for dry hair,"I have extra dry hair. Self Absorbed does an ok job on it. After several weeks of use, my hair isn't getting any drier, so far. I am still on the look-out for something better, however. This one isn't adding any more moisture to my hair, which it badly needs.I use a couple hand-fulls of it, which seems excessive to me. I have medium thickness, shoulder-length hair.The scent is light and fades in an hour or so.It is heavy enough to weigh my hair down and prevent it from being fluffy and fly-away. It might be too heavy for someone with fine, straight hair (mine is curly and coarse)."
1,Hinged hooks... why?,"3M Command adhesive strips are great, and the idea of using them to hang hooks is also strong.But their line of hooks would be so much better if they'd just think a little. Take these hooks for instance. Why on earth would you need a 'loose' hinged hook that pivots and lifts up, when you try to lift the thing off that's hanging from it? Try to lift your your oven mitt off one of these hooks with one hand (while the other is busy - as is typical in a kitchen) and the hook unhelpfuly lifts also, clutching the loop that your mitt hangs from even tighter; not letting the thing loose.Frustrating & nonsensical. What hanging item could possibly benefit from this design?"
1,Terrible - Ruined newly painted walls,"I followed all the instructions, took note of the weight limits for hanging, I put up the hooks and waited 24 hours before I hung anything. The following night everyone had fallen off the wall taking the pictures with them. They pulled large pieces of paint off and damaged the items that I had hung. Awful product!"
4,Great for inflexible beginners,"Really liked this yoga presentation because it was gentle, soothing and adaptable to my inflexibility. The voice was calm and very easy to follow without looking. I felt immediate loosening and tension relief. Mostly I was inspired to continue with the yoga exercises because I had satisfying success."
5,It's great for beginners,"I purchased this video just a couple of weeks back... and I find it's great for beginners as she explains each step in detail. There are short and long exercise modules, so you can pick depending on how much time you have got. I still havent' got to the advanced exercises, so cannot really comment on those."
2,"annoying waves, lacks pace","The background on Yoga for Beginners is just too much of a distraction and the pleasant voice is also a bit too soothing - I felt like dozing off and I just didn't have the patience to endure to the end of any of the lessons. If you like background scenery and soothing waves, this may be your cup of tea. For more focus on yoga while remaining awake and aware, I prefer any and all of the Yoga Journal videos with Jason Crandell and the Yoga Step by Step series of CD's with Natasha Rizopoulos. They also include Jason Cradell as her assistant demonstrating modified poses. All the Yoga Journal videos are 5*."
2,Boring as all hell - - - if you want a work-out,"I wanted to get into yoga because I heard it was an excellent work-out and calorie burner, and figured it would be good to try something new...This DVD is basically for the spiritual/meditational Yoga Enthusiast, which if thats your thing, thats great. However, I do NOT recommend this dvd if you're looking for a work-out. I can see how it could be extremely relaxing, with the sound of the waves and the calmness of the instructors voice, however I felt anxious because the whole time I was thinking ""when do I start exerting myself??"""
5,Great for getting started,"I had never tried yoga before and I really enjoyed this DVD. I felt it was a slow paced, good introduction to beginning yoga. The setting was nice and I loved the instructor's voice."
5,Perfect Beginners Video,This video breaks down main yoga poses in easy to follow sections to get you started and then adds extra poses and increase the length of routines as you progress. Very good cues from the teacher makes it nice and easy to learn.
2,Not enough moves,If you are interested in learning and concentrating on breathing techniques this video is great. I wanted to learn more poses and this video does not give very many poses.
3,Slow down sister!!,"The exercises are great and all, but towards the middle of the workout she starts to pick up the pace, I simply can't keep up. I don't know if it's just me being out of shape or what, but this is supposed to be a beginner's set. As a beginner, I can't go from plank to cobra to down dog as fast as she can, I need a few more extra seconds and I find myself falling behind out of exhaustion and unable to continue."
3,It's okay!!,It's ok if you are a true beginner. I would prefer a bit more advance beginner. Good price for DVD.
5,Great!,"This is a great DVD, also for people who are already experienced in yoga! The asanas are easy to follow and the instructions are easily to understand, even for Germans like me ;-) You can choose from various programmes so that it never gets boring. But I was a bit jealous of Barbara practicing at the beautiful seaside while I was trying to find enough space in my living room!!"
5,What I Needed,Good instruction on how to do the poses and her voice is calming and encouraging. The pace was good for me and this DVD was perfect for what I wanted as a beginner.
1,dont bother,ok so this dvd sucks i wouldnt even give it away its so boring and gives me no motivation to wake up early and do it i also ordered gaiam yoga for weight loss and i love it get that instead dont waste ur money on this one im serious it has alot of the same moves as gaiam just without the weights and gaiam is perfect for beginers also..
3,Great DVD But.......,This was a great DVD that I used about 8 times. Now I can not get anything on the menu selection to play.
3,Good and Not so Good,"I agree with another reviewer that this is not really for beginners. There are times when you can't even see the TV to see what it being done and you have to stop, look, listen and then get into the pose only to have her move on to something else. I think to start out a person really needs one-on-one to get the basic positions down, then maybe graduate to this tape when you know what the names of the poses are all about. I did this for a week before I lost interest. Maybe I will pick it up again later; maybe not."
5,Thank you,"Thank you for the prompt service. I have greatly enjoyed this video. I spent a lot time looking for a beginner yoga program that was suitable for seniors and this one is just what I needed. I would highly recommend it to anyone.Thank you,Jan Ainsworth"
3,Yoga for Beginners,The scenery is very beautiful. But the segment for the core is not for beginners. Some of the poses are very difficult for someone needing to build core strength. No alternative options were given.
5,Fantastic!,Fantastic beginner yoga video! I have never done yoga in my life and this video is easy to follow and the instructor is very good at describing all the moves and body alignment and placement.
4,Love the ocean setting,"I love the time and attention that was put into making this Yoga DVD. I think the ocean setting is wonderful and makes me feel really relaxed, however it makes me too relaxed because I get really tired and end up taking a nap with it on in the background. I love the woman that talks in the DVD because her voice is so soothing. She should make stuff for people to fall asleep to. Its a really great Yoga DVD though."
3,A slow beginner !,"I thought this was a good begining DVD , I did watch the intstructional part but I felt she could have had more direction with each section. I am one of those people that need to be lead by the hand and each section she kinda just started a pose ! Although I loved having the 10min and 20 min options for people on the go like me ! Overall it was a good purchase.."
5,Great form and breathing instruction...,"I'm not quite a beginner at yoga, but close. I was looking for a video that I could follow to continue to perfect my form and learn more poses. I have not enjoyed the videos that are more about meditation or do not give enough instruction on proper form. As others have said, she goes very slowly through the poses and I have wished for it to go faster sometimes, but the instruction is perfect. Also, many of the extended workouts are very challenging. I highly recommend this video for beginners and I will personally be looking for an intermediate video from her soon."
2,NOT for Beginners,I practice Yoga so I am familiar with a lot of the poses. I found this video to be tough and do not recommend this for beginners. The instructor does not spend enough time teaching you how to maximize the poses and moves through each pose too fast. I was not happy with this video.
5,JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR,"This DVD is great for me. I am a beginner to Yoga, and this DVD really relaxes me and gives me a sense of calm. I can't speak for advanced yoga people, but if you're a beginner, this is a great place to start."
4,Not as creepy as people say but a good book,"When plain Jane Goodwin is asked to become one of the Bitches (school royalty) she can't refuse.She will finally be popular.Not the regular kind of popular but so popular that no one can help but worship her.All she has to do is every week steal somthing from another girl and place it on the desk of Lurl the Pearl the creepy early religon teacher.Sounds simple right ""For one to rise another must fall?"". Not.Because a tiny part of Jane's brain is telling her this is wrong.But the bigger part of her brain is making up excuses for her and the other Bitches' behavior.But when Bitsy (the junior Bitch) tries to harm another girl named Camilla Jane stops making excuses and tries to help Camilla who's not as innocent as she seems.This is a good book that will make you look at the popular girls at your school and think ""Are they really that ruthless?"""
2,Rhymes with scrap,"This book is extremely predictable...At first, you are introduced to a teen queen wannabe-Jane. All she's ever wanted was to be popular, and can't help but admire the ""Bitches"" a group of girls-one from each grade. Then, all of a sudden the ""Bitches"" want Jane to be one of THEM! As Jane starts to become one of them, she learns their secrets and rituals.At some point in the book, they talk about ""Sandy"" who happens to be a school teacher. A little confusing? Yes. Myracle, doesn't even bother to go in depth about her role in the story, and only briefly touches on the subject.My advice to you? Don't read this book. Although the story may seem intriguing at the beginning, it is anything but. It's extremely predictable and much like the mean girls story, except harsher, and a little creepier. Afterall, it does deal with witchcraft.Hope this helped!"
5,Very well written book,"After reading this book, I came away with a better understanding of the canine mind in general and the canine protector specifically. The book was written in an easy to read and understand yet compelling way. The author not only gives a good look into how to train your canine guardian but also the reasons why you shouldn't. I would recommend it to anyone remotely interested in this subject and I plan on purchasing his obedience training books shortly."
2,Annoying writing syle,"The book may have good information in it, but truth be told, I had a hard time seeing past the testosterone influenced writing syle. His descriptions of the dogs ""A raging tsunami with teeth"" Or, ""His strike was an avalanche and his thunderous roar could make you jump off your bones."" Give me a break! I wanted to like this book, but I found this nonsense so annoying that I am truly sorry I bought the book"
4,Innovative product!,"This is a nice item to have to aid computing at home, though some reviewers here seem to take it everywhere!However, it works or functions differently with my two laptops: I have an HP 12"" with an AMD processor and there is not enough air circulation, so the laptop seems to overheat.Today I got the wedge shapped: Belkin F8N044-BRN CushTop Notebook Stand - Chocolate w/ Blue, which inspired me to read the reviews here and to compare my experience.The differences in the records for heat are very signficant. I use two programs, PC Wizard 2008 and SpeedFan (google!) to indicate heat and processor use.My Toshiba Sattelite does not overheat, or its temperature doesn't change much using this case, so some people's experience may be similar to this.However, I also have an Amazon purchased: Belkin F8N042-SLV SleeveTop Notebook PC Case - Silver, and sometimes it is nice to get way from the bulkiness of the Pockettop, with the similar but different SleeveTop."
2,Sorry,"In today's time, words are not enough to describe a sleight. Reading this book is not very easy. I would appreciate more pictures, more details . Many pictures in the book are completly useless and should be replaced by detailed photos. Sorry, I don't like it."
5,Just like I remember!!!,"I saw these online when looking for Christmas presents for my 6 yo son. I remembered them from when I was a kid and they are just as much fun now as they were back then! We spent quality time together coloring them and watching them shrink in our toaster oven...only takes a minute or so. The holes that are already in them make them easy to create keychain decorations or ""bracelets"" with the pipe cleaners (included). Also, the addition of tiny magnets in with the kit are great for 'fridge decor. Will buy another set in a different design for his birthday!"
3,Great fun for kids,"My daughter loves coloring, baking and then seeing the result. Creative children will love it."
4,"Very nice shirts, but way on the small size. Buy larger than what you normally wear.","When I bought them I bought large and they fit okay. So I kept them. My mistake. After washing they shrunk so much they are unwearable. Large is now medium. Buy at least 1 or maybe 2 sizes larger than you think you'll need if you like a relaxed fit. If you like a tight fit, just buy your size or one size up and it'll be a tight fit after washing. Scoop neck is not as nice as a v-neck, but better than most t-shirts. Colors holding up well so far. Electric blue lost some voltage, down to about 90V instead of 115V after a few washings, but still a nice looking shirt. Back to buy more in larger sizes this time."
1,ALL THESE REVIEWS ARE WRONG!,"All these reviews talking about Legend and NeverEnding Story are wrong about THIS CD. THIS CD IS NOT WHAT THEY SAY THEY ARE, THEY ARE NOT HELPFUL AT ALL. I bought this CD mislead by the majority of the reviews here (I'm the same guy who posted before saying this was not the CD). It's a Jazz CD by some obscure German band playing bass guitar. The theme song is NOT on it, the ivory tower is never mentioned, but a wah-wah bass is. TRUST ME IF YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR FANTASY SOUNDTRACKS it's not here, but if you like German Traditional (and I mean traditional) Jazz then this is for you."
2,Too Little for Too much,"I was very disappointed in this product. After a few uses it is hard to get the burgers out of the bowl. I guess for nearly $16 I was expecting better quality and performance. Stay away, get something cheaper and you will be much happier!"
2,not as easy to use as expected,i expected the silicone to help with the release of the meat from the patty maker - didn't.
2,Well it's their best so 1.5 stars,"Brutal? YES Heavy? YES Boring? YES. A very monotonous deathmetal CD, Mortician is obviously obsessed with horror films and killing people, and well they play heavy but boring. Nothing interesting here. It's just plain stinkin boring, besides there are MUCH heavier bands out there like Nile, Carcass, Origin, Exhumed, Crimson Thorn, Disencumbrance, and Vomitorial Corpulence."
1,Worst Router Ever - 0 Stars Here,"I bought this router shortly after it was introduced thinking it was the next best thing since sliced bread. Man was I wrong! For handheld use, it is stiff, cumbersome, and unbalanced. It's worse in a router table, which was the main reason I bought it. I thought the second power switch would be handy for table use, except you have to lock the handle switch in the on position. And in order to do that, I had to tape mine just so the switch would lock into place. The height adjustment is a pain to work with. Overall, this is one of the worse routers I have used. If you want a router for a router table, spend the extra money and step up to a 3 HP router"
5,HAPPY GRANDKIDS,THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AS THIS CHARGER HAS MADE MY GRANDKIDS HAPPY THAT THEY CAN USE THEIR JOHN DEERE RIDING TRACTOR AGAIN!
2,Not that great...,"I purchased this charger in August of 2011 after the charger that came with my son's John Deere Ride on Tractor stopped working (purchased in April of 2011). Its now June of 2012 and this charger has stopped working as well. We've checked the battery with a battery meter and that is not the issue. Its clearly this charger. We now have to purchase yet another charger (this will be the 3rd) because really, what else are we supposed to do? You buy an expensive ride on toy and you want your kid to be able to use it. Peg Perego should really do better with these chargers. Its the least they can do."
4,Pretty good freeze dried stew,"This beef stew is not only entirely edible, it's better than a lot of canned soups. The vegetables rehydrate well. The peas end up tasting much more fresh than anything canned, which was a surprise. The beef also reconstitutes well. The broth is a little gritty, and you can definitely tell it's freeze dried, but it's still quite good.The packaging is good. You just pour in some hot water and zip the top shut. Wait a few minutes, and it's ready to go. Doesn't get much simpler than that."
1,Can't file even a printed 2004 return,"Last year we were able to file a printed return using this software. This year not only could we not down load the mandatory update because there were no instructions that worked, but the software would not let us print a filable return only one with ""draft do not file"" written all over it. We went to Smart Tax, one of several on line providers listed on the IRS site, and used this to prepare and file our 1040 for free, and our state for a small fee this afternoon! I'll admit that having done the draft with Tax Cut helped. I'm not counting on Tax Cut to get this fixed by next year."
3,Book arrived in good condition -- Except not happy w/the publisher's print...very faint and small print so very hard to read...,this is coming from a former bookstore owner...I did go to Amazon and see if the print came in another size after I rec'd it and don't see that it does...but I have now put the book down and not sure I will actually read it all.
5,Straight from the Heart,"This is a wonderful sweet and insightful book that might just set your heart on fire. Raphael truly brings his own passion, joy and wisdom into his writing. This is not just another self-help book. I love the way he frames the ""seven invitations."" I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to deeply know themselves."
1,"No red paint in box, very strong odor, no disclosed ingredients.","The set came with 2 greens and no red. The odor from these small plastic paint jars was overwhelming. The jars are too small to accommodate the Crayola toddler paint brushes that would go with this set. I am not very happy that Crayola will not disclose its ingredients other than saying it does not use Red #40 dye. May contain ingredients found in other Crayola paints such as: baking soda, citric acid, mannitol, polyethylene glycol used for its texture, sodium benzoate used as a preservative, mineral oil and various food colorings.We will continue to look for paint by a company that discloses all its ingredients."
2,Handsets,we have had this system for a year. We to have one with static and one that says move closer to base and it sits next to base. Very disappointed in the hand sets.
4,A great phone sytem!,"We have tried numerous different phone systems... This phone has all the features we need and more. The intercom is great, the paging system is fantastic, the phones are all very durable (I hang mine on my back pocket-and it falls off every so often, but it works just fine anyway. The only single problem we have, is that we can't quite get the automated attendant work the way we want it-other than that, we feel we made a very wise choice!"
5,Very nice filters--never going to Home Depot for filters again,"The irregular size was what originally brought me to Amazon to try to find some furnace/AC filters, and these are better than anything I could have bought elsewhere for less money. The filters seem high quality and the MERV value is unbeatable for the money. I will definitely order again. No more trooping back and forth to some store trying to find the right filters!"
4,great read but parts are far fetched.,"I enjoyed it. I found that the story of the US. signing a peace treaty with Japan in 1943, to concentrate on Europe to much to believe. No matter what are losses, we would have finished the job. Otherwise very well written and enjoyable."
4,Still,"After all these years, this film still frightens me. Something about that little girl strapped to the bed possessed by an unspeakable evil. The exorcism itself is timeless, and still brings me nightmares. The rest of the film shows a bit of age, but it is a well acted and produced film. The additional scenes are good additions and enhance the film rather than take away. For any fan of horror, this film is a must."
1,Classic film mutilated by distributor watermark,"I received ""The Gay Ranchero"" as a gift after a relative and I enjoyed watching this classic Roy Rogers film on streaming Netflix. The film showed its age on Netflix, but the print was a reasonably good one. The video image in this DVD from Reel Enterprises is much dirtier, very contrasty and exhibits image weaving. A horizontal tear at about the 15-second mark makes me wonder whether this was transferred from a VHS tape. Even worse, there is an intrusive ""RE"" watermark in the lower right of the frame.Amazon insists that DVD-R content is ""manufactured from original source materials."" If so, then why does ""The Gay Ranchero"" contain a watermark for Reel Enterprises? The fact that none of these issues is noted in the product description calls into serious question Amazon's commitment to quality for its entire on-demand inventory."
4,The Minister and His Greek New Testament,"If you uncertain about the importance of the study of greek as far as your ministry is concerned,you owe it to yourself to read this book. Without some knowledge of the Greek NT, you cannot be certain that you are teaching with accuracy any english translation of scripture."
5,"great music, great sounds, great album","this is a great album. its really great with the perfect mix of singing and screaming... the guitars are so tech too! its like no other hardcore/emo album i have ever heard. the best songs on this album are ""anonymous vs. california"" and ""for a friend"" what makes them great? the breakdown at the end of ""anonymous vs. california"" and the blend of singing and sreaming at the end of ""for a friend"" A 5 STAR ALBUM FOR SURE!"
3,no suspense but a average a list drama,"This is the type of movie that misslabeled on the box as a suspense movie. So I thought it would be about a man looking for his missing wife and the wifes lover would help him. NO, it's a slow moving drama about a man who goes after his wifes lover , he wants to kill him so that the supposed suspense. If it wasn't for the excellent acting from Neeson, Banderas and Linney this would have been a snorefest. But as a drama about loss and forgiveness this isn't a bad movie, it's average at best though; so on that level it's ok. The blu ray has a soft focus to it , as if it were a older unrestored movie in which the colors have faded. Obviously it was shot this way? Like the use of a guaze over teh lens to hide wrinkles. But there are no defects in the print at least and clarity wise it won't look better than on a blu ray dvd. Just don't buy this one as a suspense movie it will make you angry."
2,Dull and disappointing,"Good cast here, but a dumb plot and a disappointing feature all around. Weak script and no point."
1,Paint was spilled all over,I was very disappointed in this. When I received this 8 out of the ten paints were half gone due to it spilling all over the box. But besides that the paint washes out of clothes and wipes up easy.
4,Good paint,This paint is great and washes off of hands and clothing easily. The bottles are small. We used the paint very quickly and had to get more.
2,Major Problems,"Not only do the handsets fail but the base unit also acted up so bad that I had to replace it in a years time which shouldn't happen when you pay over $500 for a phone! All cordless phones would break up and I finally narrowed it down to the spot where the power adapter plugged in. I would have to push in and hold until someone told me the call stopped breaking up. We have had to replace every one of the original 5 phones in the first year, some more then once when they were bad right out of the box. Now I'm having trouble just finding replacement handsets. If it wasn't for the problems I would be extremely happy with the system and it's features."
1,Poor quality phone,"My handset started having problems after one month. I didn't understand why people I'd call would always say ""I can't hear you"".Very poor quality item."
3,1 key fails also - chronic problem,"My parents bought 2 of the handsets - both #1 keys failed. Mine lasted a little longer, but the #1 key is also failing. have even taken the blasted phone apart to try and get it to work to no avail. buyer beware.Other than this nasty little problem, the phone is great."
4,AccuSharp is a great product!,"I haven't used the product yet, because I just purchased the actual knife sharpener with a new blade already in it. AccuSharp products in general have always been fantastic and affordable -- I'm sure when it comes time to replace the blade, I will be happy with the performance."
1,piscopo = pathetic!,"How can you allow people to make this kind of movies? It's theworst movie I've ever seen (Demolition High is up second). OK it maybe from the 80's but, c'mon...But I did sure laugh a couple of times, but that's just because I enjoy turkey movies...And what's up with Joe Piscopo? Fy fan!"
4,Dead Heat,Great movie. Had this on Video and wanted to upgrade to DVD. I wasn't able to obtain this in Australia and when I found it at Amazon I was thirlled
5,Fun!,This movie is terrific B-movie fun. Loved it the first time I saw it and every time since then. Highly recommended!
4,More Grown Up Fare,"Babyville is a very readable book, as are most of Jane Green's novels (Bookends being the exception.) The 3 main characters are very 3-dimensional, and I think that the fact the book is told from 3 perspectives is great. The characters call each other out on their selfish, destructive behavior, which is very refreshing. Seems like most chick-lit ""heroines"" get indulged by their friends and family.That being said, there is still quite a bit of whining and self pity in this book (which is why it only got 4 stars, I thought it went overboard.) However, the essential story of balancing friendships, relationships and family is poignant and well told. As other reviews have noted, it is a more grown up Jane Green - not as light as Jemima J and Mr. Maybe - but well worth the read!"
5,Babyville was entertaining!,"This book was fantastic. I have a 9 month old baby and related to every character in one way or another. That's what made it so funny to me! A definate good read, especially if you are staying home with a baby right now, or trying to conceive or have friends who have babies!"
4,Funny set of ladies,"I enjoyed this book and the way the author tied the 3 ladies together. I also liked listening to the book since it is of another culture. I would recommend this book but it does not have much content, more like an easy read book."
5,Baby Boy on the Way,"I have read all of Jane's books so far, and this is one of her best. Very enjoyable and fun to read. What I love about her books, is that her characters are likeable and complex, and she has a great knack for intertwining a lot of lives together. Also her attention to detail is not too over-the-top, where you get bored of reading it. I used to live in England, and as an American, I love to live through her characters in the ""English"" way.I would recommend this book to anyone who is having their first baby, parents and anyone who wants a family."
3,Babyville,"I LOVED Green's novel Jemima J. I couldn't wait to read more of Green's novels. But Babyville probably wasn't the best place to start. Most of this novel came off as silly, fluffy, precious drivel compared to her much stronger work; Jemima J. There was little to like about her characters, they were completely unbelievable to me, with the exception of one, Sam, who was the most real character of the three main ones. All these characters were selfish, insecure, atypical women. They all come off as being 30-something teenager-wannabees and too self-absorbed in themselves and too wrapped up in their party-every-night-lifestyles. Come on now, there is more to life than that!Green just BARELY managed to redeem each of her characters by the end of the story, but it was almost too little too late. However, I will give Green the benefit of the doubt and try more of her novels. She is a good writer, I just feel she faultered a little bit here."
3,Interesting story but too unreal,"The story is interesting with three women at different stages in life all related to babies: one wanting baby to repair a relationship;one got a baby but found life not what she expected; one got a baby through ONS and found the perfect match. It has a catching beginning but lacks of substance towards the end. To me, all these three women seem quite superficial and lack of depth.It is an okay read but can hardly touch me."
3,Not as good as her others,"I was a bit disappointed in this novel. It is written in a different pattern than her other books I've read. It tells the story in three parts, each about a different woman's ""baby"" experiences, although all 3 stories are interrelated and basically chronological. I say basically chronological because I actually felt that the timeline didn't quite add up. I had that same feeling in reading 'Jemima J', too. If I had cared enough about this book, I would have gone back to the first part to re-read it to double check, but one reading of this book was plenty for me.Perhaps I don't have the same appreciation for this story because I don't have kids of my own and cannot personally relate to the experience. IMO, the middle section about Maeve is the most like Green's other works that I like so much, so it was the most redeeming part of the book. However, you have to read the entire book to understand how it fits together."
2,Get a cord!,"This tool has NO POWER! It's good for about 10 cuts then needs a new charge. The only reason I bought it was so that I would have a 3rd battery for my drill/saw. I typically like Dewalt cordless tools, but I would not recommend this tool."
5,Milwaukee Products,Purchased a Milwaukee circular saw thru Amazon. Price and service were excellent. As I expected the saw performs better than others I have owned!
1,Lemon or bad design?,"The very first time I used this saw the depth of cut adjustment locking handle made a ""pop"" noise when I pressed it down and would not hold the adjustment. It is a black nylon handle on a metal shaft. I unscrewed it and rotated it backward then reassembled. Seemed to work ok.Today when I adjusted the depth and pressed the handle down I heard another ""pop"". This time the fix did not work. I wound up removing the handle and shaft and putting an aircraft nut on the machine screw that locks the depth of cut into place.I would not buy this saw again."
3,OK - But...,Just ordered and received this saw a couple of days ago. I've been using it quite a bit and it seems like a pretty good saw but the second day of use I cut the saw's power cord while setting the saw down. This saw has no brake and takes a while to stop. If I had it to do over again I'd look for one with a brake.
2,Another disappointing piece of China...,"I'm returning this unit without opening it. It's made in China, and I've got nothing against the Chinese people, I'm doing all I can to buy American. I know it's ""too little, too late"", but to do nothing is worse. And I can get the exact same thing at Home Depot for the same price."
4,Made in China with some Chinese parts.,"I always praise the Milwaukee tools. The tools made in the US that is. The last Milwaukee circular saw I bought was made in China. As I noticed some malfunction in the way it sounded, I disassembled the unit and found out that one of the main bearings was bad. I pulled it out and found out it was a Chinese made bearing. I replaced it with a top brand bearing. I believe Milwaukee should have strict quality control and top quality parts for its tools if they want to maintain the goodwill they enjoy now."
3,Amateur film making at its best.,"The greatest parts of these movies was seeing sweden as sweden. Acting was just good enough, but not even close to the english version. One reviewer wrote, when i purchased this, that Rooney needed to take lessons from Noomi. Watch the english version and you'll see he is so far out in left field he can't even see the game."
5,Dragon Tattoo Trilogy,I started my association with Stieg Larsson's work through a Swedish friend. When I purchased the three books at the same time I had no idea that they had already been produced as movies.The first book was finished in 24 hours thanks to a series of flights from one side of the world to the other. Within 3 weeks I had completed the books and was talking with the same friend about how good they were and the amazing parallels in the second book to Stieg's own life story... Spooky!My friend then advised that the books had been made into movies in Sweden! I had no option but to search for the movies starting obviously with amazon.com.The movies arrived and I am more than impressed. I can see my self re-watching them all again and again.
5,Great Video!!!!,The extended version of the Millennium Trilogy is a relatively faithful adaptation of the novels with excellent acting all around. I would recommend this set to anyone who has enjoyed the books.
4,Original has its advantages,"I did't see for now version with Daniel Craig, whom I love to see in all his films, partially because it's just one part and partially because I was thinking that for a Sweden book would be good idea to watch Sweden version and in a way I liked that it did't have any international stars like Craig, because it probably would make more difficult to follow the script, which is very twisted. It's well made trilogy which is good to watch at front of large TV set and I did injoy the plot and unexpected turns. Suddenly quite Sweden was not a pastoral no more, but full of life sometimes harsh and rude realities of modern life, also for me the movie was more interesting then the book, so try and see for your self!"
5,A Story That Will Have You Thinking About It For Weeks,"I watched the Extended Version on VOD, twice. I'll now buy the set to add to my video collection. Why? And why a subtitled set at that?Because the story line and plot are intense. Like a good book you can't put down, these cause one to be totally engrossed in the screen. Maybe there are parts of this set that could have been left to the imagination but that is a nit pick.While Amazon Prime members can ""try for free"", if you value truly remarkable acting, you'll want to own this set...and read the Novels as well. The movies are not quite as ingrossing."
5,Crayons,"Fun, effective! Perfect for the glam touch on my daughters art and design projects. Would buy again, and give as gifts."
2,"faces, forms & illusions","I'm a big fan of Delerium but not this CD. I felt that the group has lost its 'New Age' way with this project. To be more polite, they have gone in a totally different direction. The music, in my opinion, lacks melody & harmony, and lacks the ambient sounds so typical in their earlier efforts. My favorite Delerium are Karma, Poem, Chimera. Sorry to offend the raters who are obviously more inspired. I'll keep playing it; maybe something on the CD will eventually catch my interest."
1,dissapointed,"LP is great that's why i bought this single but the sound is horrible, it's like it has scratches everywhere on the cd but it's not, my fiance even mentioned that it might have been an illegal copy, which i doubt it was"
1,Complaint,I love the song &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; But my opinion is that you should buy another CD. This CD only has 3 tracks for $13.00 + shipping and handling. I was so excited to get this CD. When I got it I opened it up I saw there was only 3 tracks I was so DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!
2,Poor quality sound for music,"Speakers are pretty much as advertised, they are more than sufficient for system event sounds, but if you plan to play music through them you'll be dissapointed. Just overall tinny, poor base, etc."
1,The Seekers Guide to Harry Potter,"This is very amateurish and does nothing to enlighten. Too much music and repeat segments, had I knew this I would not have waisted my money."
1,The worst phone ever.,The battery on this phone would not last more than 5 hours. I replaced the battery twice and had the same problem. The phone will not hold a charge.
4,Gold Toe Men's Cotton socks,I've always worn Gold Toe socks so what can you say they last forever and nothing's changed. It's easy to purchase through Amazon and you usually get and good deal and free shipping if you're lucky. The only disapointment with this order is that I paid $6.00 ea. and when the socks arrived each pair had a sticker on them that said 3/$15. So this time it appears I could have done better or they could have removed the sticker and I never would have known. Thanks for letting me vent Tom Proctor.
2,Tall Socks,"It's sometimes difficult to find socks that fit my husband. He likes these socks, but they've been riding down from day 1."
4,Not for the Vegan,"I was actually looking for a vegan cookbook but I've always loved Moosewood recipes andfound this at a great price on Amazon. I assumed that I could adjust for vegan - and I can formost recipes though I question how low fat these recipes really are. There is more fat in these recipes thanI am comfortable with. The recipes are delicious sounding and though there are no pictures, that is theMoosewood way. However, this book is FULL of recipes....a dedicated cook who is comfortable with vegetariancooking would be kept busy by the volume of recipes this cookbook offers though I still think that Olive Oil isoverused, but that is me. The instructions are easy to follow, the ingredients (mostly) are assessable and the organization is intuitive."
5,moosewood low fat cook book,"as good as the first cook book, but much more inventive and in step with today's trends toward healthier eating habits. recipes and information are clear and concise. the book is a winner!"
1,Pedophile,Have not read the book but this guy just got fired for haveing sex with a 16 year old girl from his church.
2,Flimsy and overpriced,"My grandchildren didn't enjoy these at all. They may be all right for some kids, but mine were disinterested right away and ready to do something else. Dissappointed."
1,Buy the face nailer.......,For the regular user who only uses it every so often you should buy the FACE NAILER as the two guns are bascially the same except for the head so just buy a spare head for the 401 model and when you need it swop. Check this first though to make sure.
5,Worthwile investment,"I bought the 401P to put in 1100 sq ft of 2-1/4 oak flooring in my house. I used my Paslode finish nailer (16ga) for the start and end runs. Getting ready to do another 900+ sq ft in my brother's house, and I've just ordered the 501 face nailer, as I think they will stand up better over time -- may even go back and re-face my own floors...Really nice tool and turned out an awesome job -- nobody believes I did these floors myself!"
4,"Clear, efficient implementation/documentation","Provides an accessible detail of varying complexityalgorithms. Understandable pseudo code directlytranslateable to C/++, Java, Pascal, Turing.Source for teaching first and second year undergradefficiency, recursion, OOP through sorting, searching,processing. Highly effective simplification ofconceptual diffculties in the teaching of abstractdata structures. Good long-term reference item, veryeffective library reserve item."
2,"Cool, but...","My cop husband loved this stocking stuffer but it broke a couple weeks ago! The ring part is connected to the emblem with a pin that came apart. Bummer, but you get what you pay for I suppose."
5,great toddler video,great toddler videomy son has watched these so many times that the DVD should be worn out!great product.
4,Curious George for Curious minds...,My kid loves the show so the DVD keeps her constantly entertained. 'Nuff said...
4,Not The Same,"While visiting Ireland we had the most delicious tea, Barrys Gold.I ordered this tea thinking it was the same, but it is not.The Barrys Gold in Ireland was a beautiful light golden color with a different taste.Don't know if the word 'blend' on the box had anything to do with the difference??This was a very good tea, but not what I had in Ireland. Are there different Barrys Gold teas??The tea I ordered is better than what I've bought at the store so would recommend it to others."
5,Awesome for Iced Tea,"We had some at home, but I don't know where it came from, but on a whim I tried it for making a quick glass of ice tea (instead of a Lipton bag). In a rush, I made a mug of tea, let it cool a while then poured it into a big cup of ice. I am overwhelmed at how good it was. Not bitter at all (like the Lipton usually is) and a sort of natural sweetness (I take my ice tea unsweetened). What a treat! I am going to get more of Barry's for my ice tea and will try it as a morning hot tea as well."
5,I trust me Irish friends.,"Having never heard of Barry's tea and learning it's an Irish tea, I decided to check it out with a friend who has visited his wife's aunts and uncles and cousins in Ireland very, very often. Had he ever had Barry's tea? Indeed, he had. Every day, in fact, that he'd spent in Ireland. And was the tea good? Indeed, it was. He always had some on hand back here in the states.And then he told me that he liked tea strong with nothing added. One of his wife's aunts didn't approve. She gave him his cuppa and then offered him sugar and milk. When he declined, she exclaimed, ""No milk! No sugar! Never heard of such a thing. Why, it's not Ash Wednesday, Lent, or Good Friday.""I plan to buy Barry's when I find some shelf space to store it. And, I will drink it with milk and sugar if it's not Ash Wednesday, Lent, or Good Friday.Amazon, your reviewers are a hoot."
5,Best Tea Ever,"I reviewed this last time I purchased it.We are on our second order.We bought some to gift. It's that good.As I said before, we first had this tea in Ireland withapple tarts. I like mine with cream. The Irish whip whippingcream and dollop it on top. mmmThe best price is for the package of four."
1,Buy the BBC version,"The original BBC version of Planet Earth gets 5 stars, and if you bought that instead of the Discovery Channel version, you would already have this content, as it originally aired - and with the sublime narration of Sir David Attenborough throughout.The 10 minute segments ""Planet Earth Diaries"" that appeared at the end of the original episodes are absolutely riveting and are a critical component to making this one of the best documentaries of all time. Why the Discovery Channel cut this content and relegated it from the box set is beyond me. The 2 minutes of ""Behind the Scenes"" that they include with each episode are pathetic in comparison. They are basically trailers or promos.That the Discovery Channel wants you to buy an extra DVD to get this material is upsetting. Don't do it. Just avoid the Discovery Channel versions completely."
1,Phone becomes useless within the month,"Starts out great. Soon develops horrible interference from ""nearby"" (i.e. ""in the same room"") electronic devices in your home. If your experience matches mine, you will find that the high price tag is no indicator of the satisfaction you will have with this product. We replaced it with a cheap corded phone, got rid of our call waiting, and got phone company message service."
2,Returned it,"I read the reviews here and though that I finally found a phone that would replace my eight-year old answering machine phone. I'm still looking.Major features I considered:1) Good speakerphone sound quality - Poor. My office speakerphone sounds much better; and it's a cheapo!2) Backlit LCD screen - Lasts for about 3 and a half seconds on the handset, no backlit at the base.3) Dual keypad (base and handset) - telephone configuration only works with the handset, #1 above made this irrelevant.In addition, the handset is uncomfortable to hold on the shoulder; reception is good.I have to say I was disapointed and returned it."
2,static,"this phone is downright terrible. I used to have a panasonic 2.4GHZ phone that was was fried by spilled beer during a late night college thing. That phone was great and travelled through almost my entire dorm without static--a big 19th century stone monstrocity of a building. I bought this one for its speakerphone and it is static-ridden in my room. It won't ring or find a signal down the hall. Maybe it's a dud, but it's enough to turn me off to panasonic phones."
2,not worth it,"With the advent of caller id, I have come to rely on being able to scroll through the caller id list and with 1 touch, place my phone call. I am NOT able to do that with this phone. Caller ID on this phone stores a ""1"" along with the other 10 digits, as if every call I needed to make was long distance! In other MUCH CHEAPER phones I have owned, there was a way to tell the phone to store numbers differently. Not so for this phone! You have to use the ""edit"" function everytime! It's easier to just dial the #!! Even if you save the # to the directory in an ""edited"" fashion, the next time that person calls the caller id list doesn't recognize it as an edited #. For this reason, I find myself using the other, cheaper phones in my home. Way too much $$ for something that just ""looks"" good. Not all models of Panasonic are this way, so I don't know what happened here. If I knew about this beforehand, I would have NEVER have bought this phone!!"
5,It's a keeper!,"This sharpener works great, just like it's sister product (the knife sharpener) of the same manufacturer. After just a few seconds of sharpening I had my scissors as sharp as a knife! I can cut materials without even closing the scissors! Worth every penny."
1,Very disappointing,Maui: Island of Enchantment is a low budget film that almost looks homemade. I could never get it to play properly on my Sony equipment and had to return it. I would strongly advise against buying it.
4,WRONGFULLY ACCUSED...,"...of being a DISCHARGE-album, this is actually swedish crust-punx DISCHANGE's (the mix-up is understandable) first album, and the only one released under that name. The group changed their name to MEANWHILE after this record. Nevertheless, this is a remarkable effort for those who love d-beat and hardcore-punk in the Discharge-vein. Very strong songs, choruses that stick and brutal and aggressive attitude. I've been listening to this album for 12 years, never get tired of it. Highly recommended.-Goomba"
1,NOT GOOD,"I bought this phone because of it's features. (handset speakerphone, easy-to-use digital answering machine, slow message playback, etc.) I have since then learned that this phone has terrible reception including pops and crackles on my end of the phone as well as pops on the other end that people I am talking to complain about. Most editorial reviews talk about the good features that this phone has, but after about a week of using this thing you will be ready to throw it away."
1,This product is terrible!,"The answering machine is fine, however the static on the phone is terrible! When I talked to other people on this phone, they said that as I talked the static got worse. I would not recommend this product unless you LOVE static!"
2,below average,"Although this phone has decent features for a low price, the sound quality is lacking. Ever since I received this phone as a gift over a year ago people talking to me wondered if I was speaking through a cell phone, or if I was receiving another incoming call. A lot of conversations sounded choppy or broken to either party, sometimes forcing an early end to long distance calls. Another reviewer mentioned that he was able to get range of up to 50 meters, mine got nowhere near that, and this model did not include backlit #'s either. I leave the handset on the charger a majority of the time, so battery life issues haven't surfaced. Otherwise, the answering machine and speakerphone work well and would have raised the overall rating to 4 stars if not for the inconsistant sound quality."
4,Nouvelle droite explained and made relevant to Americans,"This book comprises both an apt exploration of the conservative revolutionary antecedents to Nouvelle Droite, and a relevant survey of New Right thinkers and their contemporary relevance.Dr Sunic, a Croatian native, has written his own English translation of this work, and his English style is lively and readable.I recommend this book for students and persons with an interest in contemporary European politics. Nouvelle Droite provides a key to understanding many of the current trends and trajectories in European politics, which will be particularly helpful to Americans."
3,Needs a pinch of something to make this book cook!,"I have all of the Amanda Quick novels. I am one of the first in line to buy them. I look forward to each new release. I looked forward to this one. I read it in one afternoonand when I had finished - felt very let down.I knew Quick was going for a series set in historic England. It could work. But she needs to develop the mysteries a bit more, add some tension - not just silly arguments, and make the characters more personable. I was getting tired of Lavinia's attitude, tired of March's dithering, and the secondary characters were mere puppets in this book. It was missing something. The things that Lavinia worried about seemed silly, the love scenes seemed silly not really passionate, and though we glimpsed the steel and the tenderness in March, overall he did not seem as appealing as other Quick heroes.I wanted more from this read and did not find it. I guess I will re-read her earlier Regencies."
3,Borrow from the Library...,"This one just didn't appeal to me. It and its predecessor were ok reads, but they didn't grab me the way the earlier Amanda Quick novels did.This and its predecessor have already departed my library. I recommend you check it out of the public library, unless this particular style appeals to you."
5,dont look back,It is a wonderful addition to my book collection. I've just started to read this book and so far is hard to put down. I hope you enjoy this book as I have so far.
1,Didn't last,I put this stuff down in the spring and it didn't even last till the end of summer. I did not adhere to the concrete at all. It broke apart in sticks and I've been cleaning it up ever since. I followed the directions explicitly and applied to the expansion cracks on my driveway. I just tried the Sikaflex and am already impressed with it. Time will see.
1,Product Contaminants Clog Spout,"Here is the problem that I found in both quart and gallon sized bottles: the fluid has a ""skin"" of dried product on top and also suspended in the product.NO AMOUNT OF MIXING OR SHAKING worked to dissolve them back into solution. They were slimy waste.Consquently, I fished them out with my fingers. Even then, small pieces of that skin clogged the spout inhibiting the flow from even flow to spurts and stops.In addition, I found that it helped if I poured the entire bottle of product nto an empty plastic milk bottle and shook it there.It shouldn't be this difficult."
3,Roger Roal,"There are A LOT of books on the subject. If you are doing serious research, you'll notice, footnotes are lacking. Mr Baer served his country well, but those of us in the business know he, like a lot of authors in the growing terrorism industry, never served full time in an Arab country. I would not go so far as to say ""blowhard,"" but this book could have been written by any decent to marginal internet surfer or library regular. Thomas Friedman, Judith Miller, Bernard Lewis, and Ambassador Dore Gold, among others, have already written volumes on this subject."
3,"Interesting, but mostly for hollywood.","Somewhat interesting, but certainly not a source of legitimate reference. The lack of details and sources make it more suitable for a Hollywood movie (a boring one) at best.The book often uses phrases like ""member [AAA] of the royal family donated $$$ money to charity [BBB] which [may, could, or potentially] have ended up with terrorist organization [CCC]"".Often times, the author's word is all there is to back up the information stated. There are practically no sources cited for many of the royal families stated financial records or transactions, for example.I finished this book with the conclusion that there is corruption in the Saudi governing body and in Washington. Big surprise. The solutions to the Saudi/Washington problem encompassed roughly two-or-three sentences. Nuff said.The flow of the book was a little confusing and could use some smoothing out.Worth reading, but mostly for entertainment and food for thought."
4,Interesting read...sometimes off on tangeants.,"This was recommended to me about six months ago. I found it a very interesting topic given the situation with terrorism. The author is a former CIA Field Officer specializing in the Middle East. His description of corruption and political repression in Saudi Arabia sheds light on part of what fuels terrorism in the world today. I was left with the feeling that the House of Saud was a house of cards ready to tumble in the next few years. The author also recommends a closer relationship with Syria, and cites successful practices by the Syrian govt. in fighting terrorism. One drawback to the book, however, is what I perceived to be the author's tendency toward going off on tangeants. All in all, though, an interesting read. After reading this you won't want to hear the Saudis referred to as 'Our friends in the region....""."
1,Another piece of anti-Arab propaganda,"After working so long in Saudi Arabia, Baer has nothing nice to say about this nation. He vomits its leaders and its people at every page. After working in the CIA for so many years, he fully endorses the official 9/11 story and the ""war on terror"" mythology. My conclusion is that he not a former CIA agent, but rather an undercover agent with a hidden agenda. Printing blacked-out passages supposedly censored by the CIA is a laughable trick. For whoever believes 9/11 was an inside job orchestrated by the crypto-zionist neocons, it is evident, from the choice of the patsies (Bin Laden and the 19 pseudo-hijackers) that one of the goals of 9/11, besides dragging the US into the phony war on terror on the side of Israel, was to harm US-Saudi relationship and black-mail the Saudi and Bin Laden families. This is precisely what this book also aims at. Beware of those who write history as a fight between the US goodies and the Arab baddies."
4,The glory and pain of love.,"Johnny Rivera's 1993-released CD brings us such romantic Salsa delicacies as ""Por Eso Esta Conmigo"", ""Voy A Conquistar Tu Amor"" and the hit title track. Most of the songs on this CD have lyrics dealing with both the glories and pains of romantic love and Mr. Rivera's smooth vocals and heartfelt delivery make them all the more appealing. Surprisingly, Johnny Rivera has never had the crossover success that artists like Victor Manuelle, Jerry Rivera, Gilberto Santa Rosa and Tony Vega have always had but he nonetheless was one of 1990s Salsa's brightest lights. Enjoy!"
2,Needless Beep,"The fan's industrial design is compact and sleek. The build quality is sub-par - rubber pads that keep the unit from scuffing the floor have all fallen off, the fan makes an annoying ticking sound for about 10 minutes and then mysteriously goes away. But the single worst thing about this fan is that the engineers designed it to beep whenever a button is pressed. The fan beeps to turn on, beeps to change speeds, beeps to oscillate, and most annoyingly - it beeps when you turn it off! Why? Parents who would consider buying this to use around sleeping children beware. The only time it doesn't beep is during auto-off in sleep mode - mercifully. I do not recommend this fan."
1,This fan doesn't make sense,"1. The screws does not match the holes, not just the diameter, but the holes for connecting parts are also in wrong position. Only 4 out of the 10 given screws can be fastened, really?!2. Cheap plastic base and column support. Both of them are in two pieces, and no matter how well you try to snap them together, there is big gap and the whole thing will become shaky.3. It does look too good either. It use the fake metal color and the thing just looks clumsy.How does this fan get 4 stars? Amazon's reviews never failed me like this. Now I have to spend time to return it."
4,Great Product if you need,"It's a solid professional product that will last long, long time as I expected. This probably the best out door in-use GFCI outlet I can find as it will not break, rust, leak and be UV-damaged. On schedule delivery, complete parts and easy installation. Recommended if cheap plastic is not what you want."
3,A bit boring,"Richie Blackmore's playing and John Lord's keyboard runs are always good and you can't beat Rod Evans' vocals, but mediocre songs are mediocre songs. I almost never say this about 60s albums (or any music), but this really does sound ""dated"" - and in this case, that's not a good thing.""Lalena"" is quite good, but ""April"" is a bore (no matter what every other reviewer said). ""Fault Line"" is simply filler, while ""The Painter"" is a decent blues jam.I prefer 60s psych/pop/garage to 70s hard rock, but I'd take DP's early 70s output over the late 60s stuff."
4,prelude to mk2 era,"This recording is fantastic. it's surely useful to understand mk2.It contains great rock-blues numbers (The painter, Why didn't Rosemary (surely the best song with one of the greatest Jon Lord organ solo), Bird Has Flown), a prelude to ""Concerto"" (April : fantastic!), and some remains of early mk 1 style (blind, Lalena...). If tou want to understand better D.P. mk2, you have to get this now!"
3,High alcohol content,"I ordered ""Bach Rescue Remedy Spray, 20ml""; for my 16-yr-old. My teenager can be high-strung at times, and I thought this would be good for school test and/or presentation anxiety, etc. While I cannot yet attest to this product's effectiveness, I am dismayed to find it contains 27% alcohol. This information was not listed in the product description. I realize that two squirts provide an insignificant amount of alcohol, but with our rigid school district rules, he cannot take the bottle to school. I now see that I should have ordered the ""Kid"" version, or the pastilles."
2,Sound not so good,I thought the sound would be loud. I could have this thing turned up to max and still be able to talk on the phone.You get what you pay for and it's worth shelling out a few more bucks to get the stereo surrond sound I thought I was getting.
1,Poor Quality,"I bought this item when it was marked 50% off at the mall - thank goodness I didn't pay full price. I should have taken it back as soon as I pulled it out of the box. One of the rubber pads on the bottom was missing. But I kept it because there were no more at the store. It played OK for about a month - then the darn thing woke me up at night with a strange humming noise. It was plugged in but turned off. Now I have to keep it unplugged when I am not using it because the humm is getting worse. The remote only works some of the time. The whole thing is cheaply made. It plays OK and the sound is fine when you are playing music, but it is not built to last."
5,This is why I love music!,Let me just say that I thought this was just perfect. The range of overtones was something i've never heard before and the sparse instrumentation was as intense as it was beautiful. This is one of the best sounding and most spiritual recordings i've ever heard. If you want to find out the meaning of life get this cd.
4,"Very good, but check out cummings' poetry","A very good read, but cummings' poetry is much better. The Enormous Room is disappointingly orthodox when compared with cummings' brilliant poetical works."
4,Another Satisfied Customer,"This book was in great condition when I received it. I enjoy purchasing books from Amazon, because I know that I will receive nothing but the best.Thanks Amazon and its sellers for nothing but quality!"
2,"Potentially unsafe, not that useful","I have just spent about 4 hours experimenting with the 42690 edge guide in two of my three Porter Cable routers. The edge guide sticks out too far for good vision and feel of close in work. Its length suggests it was intended to allow long reach lengths. I found it wobbly unless very carefully set up and well torqued. It will allow the router to twist and ""jump"" unless you really torque the screws and force the guide well against the router base. For long reach jobs, it would be smarter to clamp a straight edge on the work piece. For close in work, clamp a short strip of wood to the router base. This you can trust and do cheap. The edge guide itself is short, narrow in height, and will not permit larger bit diameters (I wanted to use it for a slot cutter for bread board joints on a table top.) I botched several work pieces with it and finally resorted to clamping a strip of wood to the router base. This product has now joined the sawdust in a garbage can!"
5,I like it,"I really like this edge guide a lot. The only trouble is that the screws that mount it to the router don't come with either the router or the guide, and it's not a size that most people have in their shop. It seems to be a metric M5. I had to go chasing around to find the right screws."
3,THIS IS NOT THE IMPROVED VERSION OF THE 42690,"I have the PC 892 router. The Edge Guide I received doesn't mention the 892. There is a new ""42690"" (Why PC uses the same model number is beyond me). The new version packaging does list the 892,893 routers and has a circle cutting attachment. (see Porter Cable website) The packaging is completely different in that it lists the other routers and the circle guide. Beware of what you get, I WANT THE NEWEST IF I'M SPENDING THE MONEY FOR IT; NOT THE ""CLEAN-UP BOY"", GETTING RID OF OLD STOCK. Just time wasted, I sent it back and have to order from someone else."
3,Not a bad time waster,"I bought this DVD because I'm a huge Michael Keaton fan. While he and Michael Caine are great in the movie, this just seems to be another ho-hum crime thriller. The acting is good, the story is okay, I don't think you ever really find yourself overly rooting for the bad guy. If it wasn't for the two main stars, you probably wouldn't watch."
4,A master but..,"This is a recording of masterful, soulful Shakuhachi Music brought low by cheesy over blown reverb. Why do people do this to what should be* a natural live sound?* If there is any zen it must be free from contrivance."
1,Crappy DVD Transfer,"OK, so I wasn't really paying attention when I pre-ordered this movie. I was surprised when I checked the invoice and noticed that the movie cost about 5 USD. However, it is fair to say that even at five dollars this DVD is grossly overpriced.Why? Because this looks like the worst kind of 4th generation bootleg VHS transfer. The video is crap and the audio is worse. This is, without a doubt, the worst DVD in my library (and it won't be there long). I actually checked the packaging to see if in fact this was a studio release.If you are an afficianado of Mexican bootleg DVD's then this is for you. Otherwise, ZERO STARS .(...)"
3,OK film with an awful soundtrack,"The film itself is average. You want to love it because of Ludlum, Frankenheimer and Michael Caine but it doesn't live up to it's potential. That being said it isn't a bad film; what is bad is the soundtrack. It's a definite detractor which not only dates he film with it's incessant use of synthesizer but is just wrong in terms of style. It's the soundtrack to a bad horror movie not a suspense film starring one of the greatest actors of all time and directed by a master of the genre. You want this film to be Marathon Man or Three Days of the Condor or even The Odessa File and it could have been, but it's not, and I think that's why people review it so poorly. All of that being said if you are looking for Bourne movies you are looking in the wrong place."
1,Cheaters - not a right store to buy anything,OMG these people are cheaters. i ordered spiffies toothwipes for baby they wrote SPIFFIES 221 TOOTHWIPES BABY APPLE for $5.77 plus there is $7.80 shipping so total is around total $13 which is a ok deal. i order the item and received today & shocked there's only one box containing 20 wipes. for $13 i got only 20 wipes which is very expensive.
4,Excellent Alblum,"Great cd... Ricky Martin proves that he is more than a pretty face. ""Perdido Sin Ti"" is probably the best on the alblum.. ""La Bomba"" and ""Vuelve"" are also excellent! If your looking for a Spanish alblum or just thinking of adding some flavor to your collection, I strongly recommend this CD!!"
5,I know a member of the group,"My girlfriend's brother was a member of the Turner Brothers, they came out of Anderson, In, he now lives in north Indiana. He played the sax for them, still playing the sax. He plays in churches now, don't know if he would play secular music now. Never asked him.But I did tell him that this album is selling on the internet."
4,Amazing!,"I am a part-time musician and although my main instrument is the bass, I also enjoy playing other instruments, especially the guitar. I purchase a lot of live music DVDs to see how people play what they play. Bob Brozman has a unique style of playing the acoustic guitar (mostly the steel resophonic guitar but other guitars too). He plucks the strings so hard you wonder how he keeps all the strings from breaking. He's good at getting all kinds of sounds from his guitars by his very percussive way of playing and they way he uses his slide. His rhythms are pretty amazing. His vocals are rough and almost funny at times but he also uses his voice as another instrument during some of the songs. He covers blues, Hawaiian, and some ""Indian"" sounding styles. The show is recorded live in a small German club and occassionally the camera swings around to show the people in the audience so you get an idea how intimate the setting is. Watching this enabled me to expand my own style further."
1,Awful..weirdest textbook I have ever encountered.,"This is just strange and honestly unnerving the way the book is presented. I don't get the ""old woman"" stuff at all. I wasn't sure if it was metaphorical or a stab at humor but it was L-A-M-E!!!"
1,Not a good read,"This book does provide a relative overview of learning theories and human development, however, the context in which it is presented is distracting. Do we really need to know what the Old Woman said and/or how she said it? Some of the footnotes and chapter introductions explaining the dialogue between the two parties provided some useful examples, however, it is my opinion that they could have been presented as examples within the book and not as useless dialogue between the 'author' and someone else. It was just way too distracting and very difficult to read. On a positive note, the price was good compared to elsewhere."
3,Love Letters of Great Men and Women Eighteenth Century,The book was not what I expected as it said it was the one used on Sex and the City Movie and I could not find the letters used on the movie in the book so disappointing.
4,Choo Choo review,"Great read for those who have an interest in the history of railroading. May maps, pictures, and facts about old and new railroads. I would recommend this for any railroad history buffs."
3,"Good product, but you shouldn't have to buy separate!","Of course this is a great functioning product, which Porter Cable is well known for. But I have a real problem with Porter Cable not including it in their router packages. I spent over $300 on my router, and I only got the 1/2 collet, when I needed the 1/4 inch. Both ought to be included with the router, come on Porter Cable, don't be cheap!"
5,Love these DVDs,"I bought this for my daughter's second birthday. She already has Dance, Art, and Music, which she adores. She wanted to watch the Poetry DVD immediately again after her first viewing. This DVD is often the first thing on her mind when she wakes up in the morning. It is a bit shorter than the rest of the series and includes real children talking about poetry (the others in the series are completey animated). Classical Baby is the best children's series I have found that appeals to both children and adults."
2,"Boring, stilted, and somewhat pretentious","Children talking about what poetry means to them? It might be interesting to their parents and teachers, but it doesn't make it entertaining for anyone else. The music is nice and keeps a child's attention, but much of the rest is boring."
3,Okay,"I like most everything about the underwear, but the waist on one of them is too loose and slides down during the day as I wear them. The other two pairs I purchased seem to be better, but the fit on all of them aren't great."
1,"Poorly flavored, not worth it",This tea was so weak and tasteless I wound up using two bags per cup and steeping it longer just to eke some flavor out of it. Waste of money.
4,Good Book-But seems familiar,"Interesting plot and characters, but story somehow seemed familiar. Good read anyway and worth your time. Do agree with another reviewer that too many F bombs were dropped--but that is par for the course in today's ""literature""."
4,Fishing and Fisheries Information Combined - 4 Serious Fmen,"This book is filled with both great information onfishing, but also some fairly technical information onthe striped bass fishery, its history, the physiogomyof the striper and the current state of the striped bassas game fish. Very well compiled and presented."
1,Be careful matching wood!,"We ordered from Amazon this tripod as well as the ""matching"" wine opener. We were quite displeased to discover that the wood in the tripod does not match the wood in the handle of the wine opener. Called Amazon trying to get resolution and was told ""not our problem, call the company"". Called the company and was told either (depending on who I spoke with) that it's ""close enough"" or ""it's not our problem, they are made by different companies"". I have no idea how well they function as to date, we have not tried to use either until this matter is resolved. Still trying to get a tripod and wine opener that match.........sigh"
5,Good Reading,Keeping up ith the Texas Cattlesman's club is exciting and its a page turner couldn't put it down can't wait to read the next one
4,Good guards.,Guards serve their purpose. They are easy to apply and remove and the bright colors make them easy to distinguish from other people's guards.
2,DOES NOT SOUND GOOD.,I was expecting a little bit more with this live release but it didnt live up to my expectations.The music does not capture the passion and intensity of a studio album and glen bentons vocals arent that impressive.I would recommend that you skip this one and pick up any of the early records.
2,Why?,"Deicide are masters of the death metal genre. Unfortunatly they like Obituary,Marduk,and Mayhem have made the mistake of releasing a live album. The songs are as brutal as ever;however,Glen's voice is horrible.Death Metal is made for live shows and studio material.A live cd is pointless. Before you waste $15 try picking up any of thier studio albums.This is for die-hard fans only who want to complete thier collections."
4,Great Value,"This is a very good speaker for the price and I would highly recommend it if you want a portable and versatile ipod dock. However, it is not in the same league as the Bose (not that it should be for the price). Overall sound quailty is good but the bass is a little boomy. It is better than I expected for the money and I would definitely recommend it and buy another. The only downside is no remote but again I bought this for a portable player and it was not required but if you are buying one that will mostly sit in a room I think you need a remote."
4,"Great truly portable system, however.","I love my IM9, or we lovingly refer to it, the ""jambox."" That being said, there are some pros and cons...PRO:Totally portableRUGGED (used everyday in Iraq.)Sound quality great, when plugged inGets LOUD when plugged in, still loud when not plugged in but the lows pop.CON:Sometimes the Ipod needs to be reset when in dockSound quality diminishes when not on AC powerOverall, this system is really good for dirty, rugged conditions. If you're not in dirty and rugged conditions it's still going to work wonderfully, obviously."
3,"Material is worthy of a strong 4 stars, but poor editing makes it 3",The book provides really good information and I was able to build out an application after reading it. The only problem is the editing and I hope a 2nd edition is released with fixes and updates for Spring 2.0. There are good PDF presentations out there that give a quick overview and one good tutorial that's a working example. I would google for those and read them alongside with this book.
5,A great book,"This is a great book to read if you are doing a report on Walt Disney. It offers a lot of information on Walt in an easy reading level. Easy reeding, fun book!!!"
2,Disney himself would be dissapointed,"A lover of all things Disney, I was looking for a good balanced story of his life. This was not it. The authors did not take the lesson of story boarding to heart. The book it self is written in a style that ammuses, but how can you tell the story of Walt Disney in 170+ pages? Thankfully, the book shys away from bashing Disney or trying to grab headlines with half truths, but one can't help but wonder if the authors could of possibly gone more in depth, more into the man and his world.I was dissapointed. There are no big insights here. If you are new to the life of Walt, this would be a great starter book, but I would not reccomend it for the die hard fan."
3,Nothing to write home about...,"I bought this printer over a year ago. I use it mostly for work, which means 95% of my printing is just black text, and it had done a decent job for that intended purpose. I have tried printing some photos on glossy photo quality paper, and the results are not impressive. My biggest complaint, however, is the lousy job of feeding paper. It will often times grab several sheets at once and pull them all through a the same time! This can be extremely annoying, paticularly when it grabs another sheet of paper half way though a page, which completely screws up any multiple page print jobs. I did buy this because it was cheaply priced (got what I paid for), and I do like the 4 seperate ink cartridges, but I think you can do better. Do youself a favor and spend an extra [$$$]or so and buy a better quality printer, especially if you plan on printing the occasional color glossy picture."
1,Beware of this product and weaKnees.com,"Buyer beware! I purchased a DVD Recorder, RCA Model DRC8040N, [...]to record movies off of my Tivo. After returning the unit twice and receiving a brand new unit, I still don't have a functioning recorder.The sad part is, I thought the new unit was working. I recorded about 20 movies over the course of a few months, and after each, I played back a few minutes to see if it looked ok. It did. However, the first time I tried to watch a movie (full playback), I discovered that the movie did not record successfully. Part way through the movie, the picture either freezes, skips large portions of the movie, or jumps around. I tried to watch a few more recorded movies. Same problem on all of them.[...]"
1,Why no hard drive?,Why buy a DVD recorder without a hard drive when for the same (or lower) price you can purchase an RCA DVD recorder with an 80 Gig HD (#DRC8030N)?
3,A singing cowboy John Wayne,This movie is remarkable in several ways:1) dubbed sound track for the singing2) the California Water rights themeJohn Wayne never again let them fake his voice after this.This movie was before he became an international star.The L.A. Antelope valley/ Kern county water wars are part of California history and were heating up again when I was a boy in the late 50's with the construction of a dam.We are again in a water shortage period with the desert communities on the short end of the list.So the several movies about the California water problem in the early 1900's are important historically as well as fun as westerns.All the LA county/ Orange county citrus ranches had a price to other communities in water.
2,Hmmmmm...,"This book looks really cool from the outside, and does have some great drawings. That being said this book is very poorly written, and a scattered mess."
4,Displacement,"This book is thoroughly engaging. The sense of displacement articulated by Said, particularly when it is experienced in one's own surroundings, is acute. Surviving Cairo in the fories with a name like Edward (not to mention cousins George, Robert and Albert) must have been grueling. But the diplacement is deeper than that and its many manifestations are present at every turn."
1,Somehow Boring,"I am not a fan of Said, nor did I read his political writings, I am more into memoirs and this one was boring especialy the first 97 pages, the rest of the book (198 pages) were more interesting. Said's parents are more of a typical old fashioned arabic parents, I believe each of us arabs experience a lot of what he went through. Writing the memoir must have helped him during his illness. I wish him good luck."
5,"Bach, Kabuki & a Cello","A wonderfully realized film, bringing two brilliant artists together with a visionary filmaker's sure touch. Ma is inspiring and inspired, and Tamasaburo Bando is incredible, in his (Onnagata) role. In my opionion the best of this series. A great gift for any lover of Bach, Kabuki or high art fully exposed and realized. Full of spirit and discovery. An intriguing path-of-discovery from all those involved. Highly recommended!"
2,Didn't last long.,"I returned my first PC 7529 within 30 days because of a sticky collet lock pin that, needless to say, didn't fully retract and damaged the router. My second PC7529 lasted a little over a year with very light use and now will not start due to a probable switch problem. Note that Porter-Cable service centers are few and far between, so check out Porter-Cable's web site to see if there's one near you before you buy this tool. While it lasted, the tool was great as an accurate hand-held router, although the plunge action was somewhat sticky. If mounted in a table, this plunge action stickiness makes for very frustrating height adjustments. My replacement router will be something other than the 7529."
1,cheap plastic,"disappointed. this is an all-plastic (cheap plastic) fan that does nothing but oscillate. there is no other vertical or horizontal adjustment, so where you place it on the wall is critical. have had no mechanical problems w/ this fan (so far), but for $60 I expected a lot more."
1,Beware of Microtek Scanners,"I have been using a Microtek 1000xl pro scanner at work for the past two years. The scanner recently stopped working. Since the scanner was out of warranty (1 year) and Microtek does not offer repair of their scanners in the United States I was notified by Microtek that the scanner was of no use anymore and that they would gladly sell me a new scanner with a discount. I asked if they had a repair facility in Canada and was told yes, but they will not repair scanners for customers from the United States. My advice is to steer clear of Microtek products until they work out their problem with servicing their products. It will be interesting to see if they actually work to solve this problem, I sense they may not, as their customer service rep had the discounts for a replacement scanner memorized with the discounts diminishing as the scanner ages. It seems like a pretty good deal for Microtek."
4,"Sweet, Sweet, Bittersweet","If you're looking for something fast paced, this book probably isn't for you. There are elements of suspense and action, but not a lot. That's not its purpose.However, if you're looking for something that lets you know, ""If he can make it, I can make it"", then this is a must read. A strong spiritual thread is interwoven in the life of a man, who like Job, keeps comin' up against it.There are finely drawn characters who I would like to meet, and a setting that feels grand and raw at the same time.I'm proud to add it to my collection."
2,Too much death making this book unenjoyable,"Warning spoilers"" The writing style was very good. I was fine with the hero loosing his wife but when half of the book was about his children and they both die also I could only skim to the end and move on. I will definately try another book by this author. I am only writing this review so others can know that there are a lot of main character deaths. If I had known I would have steered clear from this book."
4,Tasty Little Treat,"This may be just a short ep but its a good one. The Song ""Look Away"" is very good indeed, and makes a strong case for their upcoming album. Full of vibrant catchy pop filled to the brim with harmonies you don't often hear anymore. The other songs are also very good. The second to last song with the female vocals being the standout track. All in all this ep is short and sweet, and makes a yummy appetizer."
4,"Great product, great price!","I have used Amazon's rating reviews to decide what to buy for quite a few years now and may have to change that as I can't believe all the horrible reviews for this Brita system. Will say that it costs less at Walmart. We had NO problems installing it, no problems seeing the indicator light, and no problems with the water flow. I have gone through three PUR faucet systems and they all had the same issue of cracking/leaking. This is made with a lighter top than the PUR which always would come loose and then crack.BUY this Brita...it is a great way to save money on all those water bottles."
3,filtration light-none,"I purchased this four months ago. I could have notified you then but, I didn't use it until the holidays. The awareness light has never worked! I can taste it filtering, and hopefully I'LL KNOW WHEN IT STOPS THE FILTERING.I LOVE AMAZON, iT IS SO RARE that I am disappointed in them. their sales and free shipping are a great incentive!"
1,Worse design ever,"The worse part of this is not its shoddy construction, tendency to leak, short usable lifespan or ridiculously difficult to operate switch - it's the way the filtered water sprays out in six different directions! Seriously you can't get all the water into a single cup or fill a bottle without standing there holding it up next to the filter. And forget about filling the kettle - it's impossible, unless you pick on of the six streams and just let the other five go down the drain. Worst filter design EVER. How hard is it to make a faucet where the water goes straight down?!"
1,waste of money,"After connecting this unit I found that an increase in water pressure caused the unit to pop off at the threads. I'm not talking about a lot of pressure here either. It appears that the orifice used to channel the water up thru the filter is too small which in turn builds up a lot of back pressure. Also the few times that I got it to work, I had to slooowly run the water. This is a really bad design. The last unit I had was a Teledyne and worked great, I just couldn't find filters for it. I guess I'll buy the one from Pur and see what happens.Follow-up: turned out the unit came with a clogged filter cartridge. Unfortunaely I found this out after buying another brand."
5,Get the metal connectors from Brita,"and it will work great. Call them and they will send them to you for free. They send a full set of metal parts that should work with most faucets -- I have successfully used them with different faucets in two apartments, and my current faucet is very old, but I was able to find an adapter in the set that works. The metal connectors solve the problems with water pressure, and are more durable. Do it before you mess up the base by tearing up the threads trying to get it on tight enough."
1,The Leakers,"The Brita 35214 model faucet filters are a piece of junk-- Brita should recall the whole batch of them and offer customers a refund. I bought two of the units and both started to leak and squirt water within two months. The water does taste good, but getting water all over the sink counter top is not worth it!! Product is not recommended!!"
1,The life span of these is barely 4 months,I have had two of these things. Both had started to badly leak after 4 months (tops). Plus very difficult to get this thing on. Not very well made (or perhaps they are made to breakdown quickly - who knows). Avoid at all costs.
1,Terrible design,"This is an awful product; the lever is so hard to turn that I'm avoiding it and using unfiltered water. Also, the light indicator is on top of the unit and not visible unless I stand on my toes and look straight down. Save your money and buy another brand."
1,"Save your money, get something else","This system only lasted for a few months. It was great at taking the chlorine out of my water, but the design is seriously flawed. After not too long the switch to turn the filter on and off got stiff. I had to force it to turn with pliars for a month or two before the thing began to leak so badly that I had to throw it away. Also, this doesn't fit every faucet type."
2,Brita,"This is my review of the product (Brita 35214 Faucet Filtration system)its a water filter so nothing special about it,easy to install andreplace the cartridge but there are some flaws like.-Cartridge replace indicator is not clear (Not LED)-if you have a strong water pressure expect water will come outnear the filter.-One major I don't like with this filter is the knob,it needsredesigning, the more you use it the more harder to twist,andcurrently I am using pliers to twist the knob coz its alreadygave me a sprain in my wrist.-I end up buying a new brand with a knob that easy to twistand will not sprain my wrist, I'm just waiting for my britafilter runs outI don't recommend this product although it function asintended."
1,Lousy Filter,"I bought this filter ~ 2 years ago and after 4 months it started leaking all over the place. Returnedit for a replacement and that one also started leaking under one year. The leaks occur from multiple locations but not at thehookup to faucet. After reading other reviews, it appears that this filter is know for leaking because it can't handle the water pressure. I read that the Culligan FM-15A is much better for the same cost."
2,"Get something better, honestly","As with the other reviews, the included plastic inserts are worthless, but even beyond that, once you fix that problem, its still not exactly a good piece of equipment.When its on unfiltered water, it comes out like its all blocked up with jets at weird angles and such.The knob is oily smooth and can be difficult to turn, it should have been textured.The button on the back, water shoots out of it whether you are on the filtered or unfiltered selection after a few seconds of operation, means you get unfiltered water dripping exactly where you put your cupThe filters tend to not seem to stay very 'secure', but they don't pop off, just seems cheap.I got mine at Walmart, was like $12, the filters cost more than the whole thing, but given that it fails to do any of its very basic tasks well enough to, you know, work right, spend an extra $5-$10 and get something else, I'll be replacing it with something a bit more high end."
1,There's a reason it's only gaurenteed for 30 days...,"We got this filter, and it's simply pathetic.Firstly it sprays water in all possible directions, it is a mission turning the leaver up and down, and we just got rid of it now."
4,"Best Hit Ever!!!! ""Suavemente!""","Do listen to this excellent album, coz I'm telling u, u can't even stop rewinding to Suavemente... I'm from Australia (Melbourne)and latin music is not so popular hear and u don't hear much about it either. I must say that Elvis Crespo and my other favourite band DLG (Dark Latin Groove) u can't go wrong in buying and listing to their music. U just wanna shake ur bon bon!!!! Though I have my own fav australian latin band FURIA and they too sing Suavemente and I make sure I drag my friends just to see them and dance to that song! Pretend its Elvis Crespo singing!!!!! Enjoy!!!!"
3,Decent Card,"The main fights I wanted to see on this card was Edgar vs Maynard 3, Aldo vs Florian, and Lauzon vs Guillard. I was also excited to see Chael Sonnen come back. I think the main event of Edgar vs Maynard 3 deleivered as did the Lauzon vs Guillard match; but from top to bottom this card was just average compared to the rest."
2,It was ok.,there were too many judges decision in this event.i liked first round finishes of knocks and submission more than judges decisions.
2,"I see you baby, but not much else!","The funky fat boy slim remix of ""I See You Baby"" is what drew me to risk buying the whole CD. For those of you who are looking for this type of groove I suggest buying the CD Single over finding disapointment in the lack of similar dance grooves in the rest of the album. Fat Boy Slim rules the Dancefloor!"
5,A really great album,"I bought this after a friend of mine recommended it. It's great! Of the 13 tracks - 4 are what I would call ""pop"" like ""Everybody looks the same"" which is on the soundtrack of Madonnas new film - The next best thing. The other 9 are really wonderful ambient sounds that you can listen to over and over again and hear something different. Dusk you and me, Chicago and At the River are my favourite tracks. One of these guys can really play the trombone - not an instrument you associate with current pop musicians. I can't recommend it too highly."
2,hugely overrated,"The fact that Groove Armada have chosen to include their most successful single, ""At The River"", on this release, when it was actually on their previous album, speaks volumes. What's truly disappointing, though, is that nothing on ""Vertigo"" tops it, and ""Northern Star"" has been rereleased with ""At The River"" excised: a shameful historical revision. Other groups are already being touted as the 'successors' to Groove Armada, so buy the single and consign the album to history."
3,Chill,Great CD to let plat from start to finish. Nice chill anmd relax music to play on any ocassion. At work as background music or at a small get together with friends. At The River is my favorite track so far.
5,timeless,"An absolutely beautiful album that creates a timeless feeling. This was my introduction to koto music, and I am truly looking forward to listening to more examples of such elegant, exciting composition and beautiful sound."
2,Total WET RAG and LIMP flick. Snoozapalooza,"WOW the previews on TV hyped this movie to be something SO GREAT and it was actually a total let down on so many levels. Not what I expected and the ending was laughable. Drab, boring, and really just uninteresting. Washing the toilet or taking out the garbage would have been more interesting and productive that watching this sad excuse of a movie. If you love movies that just DRAG on and on and on and on and on and on with a pathetic, low budget special effects ending, then you have found your dream movie right here. Otherwise, skip this."
5,Extremely well made emotional low budget Monster flick!,"This is what you always dream people could make of a monster movie with such a minimal budget!Real emotion in the characters, and a nice creepy feel to boot, while not just throwing gore in your face with no emotion (dont get me wrong, that can be fun too). If you like monster movies, i would highly recommend this, better than i would expect to be honest, glad we could see it early."
3,Where's my pitchfork?,"Movies can be literature or entertainment, and occasionally, both. ""Monsters"" gets 4 stars as literature and 2 stars as entertainment, for 3 stars overall. The are many good things to say about the artistic success of this low-budget ""indie,"" but it often fails to forge an emotional link, even when it satisfies intellectually. It makes valid points politically and socially, but often with an insufficently subtle touch. When the photojournalist pontificates that a photo of a dead child is more lucrative than one of a happy child, he fails to muse on how many corpses populate the movie in which he pontificates. On the other hand, there are some peek-through-your-fingers scary moments, and the depiction of the aliens near the end of the film is fascinating and illuminating. I'll watch this one again, but in general, I would recommend ""Monsters"" as a rental rather than a purchase, for most viewers."
4,Great except...,"This was a terrific, novel, feet on the ground, adventure/sci-fi. The only fault was what was done with the photographer: he shot everything in sight at the beginning, but stopped doing so at the most important and, for the story, illuminating events in the last quarter of the movie. Why that choice was made left a gap in the over-all continuity of the film at the worst time, the end."
1,I do not like it at all,"Be aware, this movie do not have an understanding end. the performance of the actos are very very bad. the movie end and you do not know almost nothing. the places are wrong, the names of the places are wrong.The end of the movie let you asking for a lot of questions and you stay in your chair looking for a logical answer but you will never know it.thank you very much."
1,Plotless derivative drivel,2 people try to escape a barren wasteland. They make it. And fall in love on the way. Did the writers fall asleep?
1,Dont buy,"WEll, I was looking for a monsters movie and read some reviews. Most of them were good. So I bought it along with the other dvds I really wanted to buy.I just finished watching the movie. IT IS Sooooooo boring. The movie IS NOT one of the monsters movies that year. Well, if they did not do another one the very same year, then the quote might be correct.There are hardly monsters to see and the story is only about a photographer who has to bring his boss's daughter back from Mexico to the USA. It is about their relationship and trip back to the US. Nothing really happens.I am really mad at me that I bought this movie. It is only worth to scrap it! A boring movie, nothing happens, very cheaply made. It will disappear in my dvd collection of dvds which wont be watched ever again.."
4,BAD BOY,"This movie needed more monster scene not enough destruction, plenty of third world scenery if you like to see people lived in poverty."
3,Not horrible but,"This movie is 95% chick flick and 5% sci fi. The movie's should be caleed ""Monsters are Scarce"". The whole thing turns out to be a boy meets girl movie and a whole lot of nothing else."
2,Slow and disappointing,"This is yet another science fiction film that begins with a good story idea, but drops the ball. It took at least 40 minutes for anything to happen and when it appeared there might be some action the movie ended. If you want to see a good science fiction movie watch Splice, because Monsters doesn't make the cut. Why do so many film makers think aliens look like squids or reptiles?"
1,Boring,"A waste of time. I wondered why it lasted in theaters for such a short time. Now I know. Outside of about ten minutes worth of action, I was bored to the point of falling asleep."
1,"""Monsteriously Dreadful!!!""","""My heart goes out to all the talent involved in this absolutely dreadful film. With all the many wonderful projects floating around the film industry, along with the wealth of gifted talent, something like this gets produced? I'm totally baffled by it all. I hope this talented cast and crew will find more rewarding projects/venues to share their art, and move forward with their professional careers..."""
2,Funny bad,"I have issues with monster movies where the female lead is always dressed and looking sexy tousled, her hair and face just so, even as she sweats her way from one near-death to another. That was the funny part for me. I laughed. There is no chemistry between these two as they try to make their way home to the US from the alien-infected jungles of Mexico. Yes, the movie tries to make a social commentary about immigration and keeping the Mexicans out. Here, a huge wall is there to keep the aliens out, unsuccessfully, it turns out. I'll credit the film with not overdoing the scares. There is more threat of scare than actual scare. The aliens looks like giant shrimp, and while not entirely believable, they look okay for cheap special effects. The other effects are better, such as the wreckage left behind where the aliens have been rampaging. The script stinks, and the two lead actors are bad. Should you watch? Maybe. Just don't expect much."
2,Eh,"I watched this movie under the pretense that it was a ""Big Monster"" movie. I didn't realize it was a dull, listless walk through someone's attempt at making a point through cinema. Acting was there, scenery was there, the extraterrestrials were not. There was no suspense and I could not bring myself to care about either of the characters. All in all, I feel it was a waste of money and time."
2,Dull,"It started off with a good idea, but the execution is very poor. The main characters are incredibly unrealistic and act with horror movie logic. It does not fit the survival-drama plot.We couldn't get past the horribly wrong geography. If a movie is supposed to be set in Denver, you wouldn't show characters on sandy beaches. The creators must have thought most people aren't aware that northern Mexico and the SW US are mountainous desert. The jungles and Mayan temple made it impossible to take this movie seriously."
2,Only worked for about 3 days,"I don't think this is a particularly good power adapter.I have had this item for a little more than a week. I have used it for less than three days in that time, and it has died.I guess, in this case, you get what you paid for."
1,Porter-Cable 42000 9-Piece Template Guide Kit,"The kit that I received did not appear to be cast as some of the Porter Cable sets apparently have been, but they may use stamping in their manufacturing process because they are obviously not ""machined"" (as in cut on a lathe). However, I found that these steel guides do not work nearly as smoothly as brass guides such as those available from Oak Park. The reason may be the cadmium plating doesn't seem to be very smooth. The brass guides are quite a bit more expensive but are very well machined. When I bought my Leigh D4 Dovetail fixture, I was advised by the Leigh rep at the woodworking show to not use the PC guides. Leigh can supply guide sets that are very high quality machined steel. I bought the Leigh guides and found that they are just as good as the Oak Park brass guides, but I still prefer brass for its smoothness."
5,Let's be clear,"The Naked Communist is an essential read. We have generally dismissed socialism, socialist dictatorship and communism as having died in the 1990s. These have neither died nor are on life-support. Skousen makes it brilliantly clear how the plans of this nefarious philosophy have self-perpetuated and that there exists within humanity the desire to command and control other humans even at the peril of economies and self-worth. If you have questions about communism or even the underpinnings of a socialist or what comprises these philosopies buy this book and gain some knowledge. With knowledge you are alerted to the surreptitious changes that may be afoot in today's 'self-described' leaders of personal freedom. You might be shocked to learn that these individuals have NO desire for you or me to be free to think, understand and live."
3,Beginning of Communism,"I found quite a few interesting things that I was not aware of in the book. However, towards the end of the book I found it harder to read. I definitely would consider it on the college level and do not know anyone I would recommend it to."
1,Not XP Compatable,"Microtek insists that this product is XP compatable. IT IS NOT COMPATABLE. Beware of any manufacturer that does not have the XP compatable certification but insists that its products are compatable. I have had the same issue with Visioneer. The products do not work easily and destabalize XP. I had to rebuild my 3-month old system as a result and lost a lot of time trying to do so.I strongly recommend that you purchase a product that is certified. Microtek does not have the customer support to deal with the users issues that arise as a result of the XP and so if you purchase the product for the XP platform, you will be stuck."
2,Didn't work,"This gets 2 stars just because the software seemed OK. My scanner didn't work and I had to return it. The scanner bar jammed up about 2 inches into the scan. Microtek's ""support"" site is TERRIBLE, it looks like they threw it together in a day of odds and ends, with no real thought to what people would need to know. Surely with as many bad reviews as this for all of their products, they'd have amassed quite a lot of FAQ's/troubleshooting tips, but if they have, they are keeping them to themselves. I had to return this on the same day I had to return a VCR that didn't work. Don't things work anymore? With this many products going wrong (if my experiences and all the dismal reviews of these products are any indication), wouldn't it make sense just to make a little effort to get it right before they sell these things?"
1,Beware of Microtek,"I recently purchased a Microtek scanner from an individual seller. Through no fault of the seller- it arrived with one of its mirrors broken.I called Microtek who said they would not sell me the mirror due to liability problems. They also do not have an authorized repair shop network. I asked if I brought it to a local repair facility if they would sell them the part for repair, and they said yes.THEY LIED.They said to the repair shop owner they won't sell their parts to anyone and the only way they would see it repaired is to send it to California. Period. My repair shop asked why and they said "" We don't sell to anyone"" and hung up on him!! They may be great scanners but I never got to try mine. Their attitude and service for the consumer is horrible. Let the buyer beware!"
4,great for beginners,"i would recommend this camera kit for anyone who is learning b&w photography. it is all manual, which is perfect for learning and lets you have more control, and it is inexpensive, so if you decide photography isn't your thing after all, at least you didn't waste too much money on it. of course, it is inexpensive for a reason. the lens isn't that great, and it's a little hard to find another one that fits, and i had some minor problems with the film advance that wouldn't normally occur in a new camera (nothing that affected my pictures, but it might if it gets worse). all in all, though, this is great for starting out photograhy, especially if you are taking a class. i would recommend the kit with the 50mm lens instead of the zoom lens, though, 'cause the zoom lens is f3.4, whereas the 50mm is f1.4, so you can take pictures in lower light without having to use flash."
4,I love this camera,"I bought this camera for a beginners B&W photography class, and although it's basically the bottom of the line, it's a great little camera. All of my pictures came out clear, unless by my beginners error, of course. It's light weight and very easy to use. I'd reccomend this camera to anyone who wants a good SLR, beginner or non."
2,Got a Second one from the company after lots of haggling over the phone,"I purchased this from a different online dealer that is has a very good reputation, but it was having light meter problems right out of the box and all of my negatives were either over/under exposed. To verify this,I took the camera with the 28-70 lens to a local camera repair shop and they verified my problems with the light meter and told me that the lens was underexposing as well.I tried to talk on the phone with the company that bought out vivitar but they wouldn't budge and kept me on hold for 40 min. Extremely rude customer service. When they came back they just kept telling me that they could do nothing even though I have a one year warrenty!! I finally got help through their email and sent everything back. Got a new camera and they fixed the lens(maybe, I still think it is a little off)free of charge. Avoid the hassle dont buy this camera kit. If you have the money get a nikon or canon, its a much safer bet even if used."
5,It has all the bells and whistles,I am really like this camera it has all the bells and whistles. The photos come out great. I got this as gift and I just wanted to let peopl know it is good choice
2,dont waste your money,"The camera itself is ok. The lens that it comes with is worthless, a maximum apeture of 3.5 is not very big at all. Pictures will be crap unless you are in a lot of light, especially if you like to use slow speed film. If you really like the camera, I would recommend buying the body and lens seprately."
2,the base for these are useless,i haved used at least 5 of these routers and they work great right out of the box but the base becomes warped very quickly making it difficult to router properly especialy with flush cuting bits i have 6 years of full time wood working experiance and the last time i used one i messed up flush cuting because the base was not flat i would by the Bosch 1618B if u plan on using the router more than a few times because of the superior base
2,Just ok.,I bought a bunch of these and found that the lids are hard to get on and off. They do not stack well being so light and a few of mine have lids that don't close all the way. Almost as soon as I got them I started looking to replace them. I bought them with a plastic turntable and it doesn't turn. It is square so if it wanted to turn it would be awkward. They are ok. Not impressed.
1,didn't order,"I was veiwing my options for shipping when all of a sudden I was told my order was complete. I did not intend to order this item today. When I finally talked to someone on the phone, I was told that I could not cancel the order. This is very poor customer service."
1,Defective Product,All 3 Porter Cable rechargable batteries I was sent from Amazon were defective. I would not recommend ordereing them from here.
2,Safety Frame,This unit is not as sturdy as I would like for my mother. The back attaches underneath the scres for the toilet seat so it will stay on but the sides wobble significantly and my mother became frightened when she used them. I finally took it off.
3,Bad Mix,Great songs but the sound is horrible. I only listened to it once. Also bought Live in Europe. That would have been so nice if the sound wasn't so bad
3,Asoka or I soak you for some money,"As a historian, I was hoping to see something close to history, well the dress seemed authentic but the plot and the song and dance were sad. I really wish they just stated this was a musical with a little bit of history thrown into it."
2,Does the king really shine?,"Asoka really was reviewed as a magnificent portrayal, but I have to disagree. Shahrukh's acting was good, but his producting and directing skills alongside Juhi Chawla is hardly eyecatching. I'd have to say Kareena Kapoor delivered the best performance, especially with the female fight scene, even though she did end up being like the Indian Britney Spears, by taking off her clothes. It isn't shown, but the film shows a lot of violent and sexual themes, amidst the chaotic action. The music is excellent though, except for the annoying ""Aa Tayar Hoja"". I wouldn't waste my money on this, it really isn't too great at all."
1,Buddies and Beer,"Not sure what these other chaps were watching, because this flick is laughably bad. Amazon.com's rating system needs a ""B-rating"" for movies such as these, because in the right setting, these movies can be good. One star if rating it as a ""serious"" movie. Probably in the 3-4 star rating for a ""B-rated"" cheese flick. Watch it with a group of friends and the aid of some mind altering substances, and you'll have a good time. Just remember to keep the DVD remote at hand to skip over the ""song and dance"" routines. We're talkin' painful.... not dissimilar to what I'd expect a cat in heat caught, in the fan belt of your car doin' 80 MPH would sound like.... Don't say I didn't warn ya. If you have a regular ""bad movie night"" with your buds, then check it out... but its definitely a rental."
4,Nice,Bought with some other items for friend who collects strawberries for her kitchen. Makes a nice gift she loved it.
5,Works great!,"Great price for the product. Received it very quickly as well. Used it on my first charity bike ride, great aid in knowing how much farther you had to ride."
4,a good deal,I use this speedometer every day and it works perfectly fine. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it loses 1 star since the rubber rings provided with the product were small for my bike tube diameters so I had to find and use other and larger rubber rings to attach it on the stem and the front suspension.
4,Good value for the price.,"I've used the Sigma BC906 before and generally liked it. It releases from the bike quickly, both a + and -. I replaced my old one after it came off the bike and was run over by a car. Numbers on the display are large and easily readable. Buttons are large, and occasionally I hit them accidentally. Battery life is good. Resistance to water seems at least average. I got my first BC906 at my local bike shop and they'd quit carrying it, so I ordered online, ordered from Amazon, it came from Nashbar.I didn't want cadence. My main desire was current speed, odometer (trip and total) and current time. This unit does all those functions quite well. Four stars for good value and price, a deduction for a bit too easy to knock off the bike, and a set up procedure that always sends me online to find the manual -- nonintuitive. For $15, I'm pleased."
4,sigmaspeedometer,"for the price it's a great speedometer. keeps track of all your stats very well. my only complaint is that it gets confused wether you are going forwards or backwards easily (the little arrow points in the direction it thinks you are going), but that defect does not effect your total distance or trip distance.the other complaint is that the speed is only read with 2 readings for the decimal point. .0 or .5.but for the price this is a great reliable speedometer.im on my second one of these simply because my first one was stolen because i forgot to unclip it from my bike. (it has a nice twis and pull system to remove the computer when you park your bicycle somewhere)."
4,Sigma BC-906 Bicycle Odometer,"Received the bicycle odometer quickly and in good condition. Installation was fairly easy and I am back to keeping track of the miles and time spent on the bike. The programing was a bit quirky and resetting some of the functions takes more time than necessary, but it works."
4,A wonderful story!,"Much more than a mere romance novel, this dramatic saga is about a long-standing feud between two families, its devastating affect on later generations by separating true lovers, and how a baby's birth and the caring work of a woman-doctor overcame the anger/hatred and brought the families to a new understanding and reconciliation."
4,Heavy and low,"We got this seat for my daughter so her care provider could fit 3 in a row in her back seat. It is a sturdy seat - very, very heavy. It folds, which is nice, but I can't imagine carrying it anywhere. I feel she is safe in this seat. However, it is very low and even at 3 years old she can barely see out the window in it. Plus, the strap is starting to shred where it rubs against the clip. This is frustrating. However, the narrowness of the seat is a big plus when it was used in a 2-door with a small backseat."
3,Does not work with lap shoulder belt install if you don't have top tether!,"I wanted to install this seat in my 98 Honda CR-V. I opened it all up, went to the page on installing with Lap-Shoulder belt, and the top of the page states Warning! Do not install without Top Tether!. Well, if I need to install using the seatbelts, chances are, I don't have top tethers either.So I couldn't install this seat in my car. I ended up putting it in my DH's Grand Caravan, which my kids rarely ride in, and putting the Britax Roundabout from that, into my Honda."
3,Not as portable as you'd think,"I've had this seat for several years. It's a reasonably good seat. However, there are several issues worth mentioning. It does fold flat, which sounds great in theory. The problem is that the seat is so heavy that schlepping it through an airport is truly unpleasant. I've also found it very difficult to weave an airplane seatbelt behind the seat in order to secure it (complicated of course by everyone else trying to board the plane around you). It almost negates any benefit provided by the ability to fold. I've also had trouble securing the seat with lap and shoulder belts in an older Honda Accord that doesn't have LATCH. Securing it in our newer car with LATCH worked fine. On the plus side, this seat is pretty narrow and low profile, which may help in smaller cars. It's also tall enough to fit older children. The bottom line: if you think the folding feature makes this a good portable seat, look at one in person to determine if the weight will be an issue."
3,The Jury is still out,"I bought this a while ago but just had the police install it last week. Rear facing for my 8 month old, it won't fit in the center, must be on the passenger side. Minor annoyance for my 6 foot four inch husband who now must drive everywhere since he can't fit in the passenger seat. I'm taking it on the plane in a few weeks and we'll see how it works then. The strap adjustment is nice but they get tangled a lot. I honestly don't see how this will work to 65 pounds but maybe they will surprise me."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased the Radian 65 about a year ago, primarily because it is very narrow, and I need to fit 3 kids in the back of a sedan. If I could fit a wider car seat in the car, I would definitely choose something else. It's easy enough to put together and install. My dislikes are:1) Frayed edges. Some of the stiched edges have frayed and I have to cut off long pieces of thred from time to time.2) Fabric cover does not stay attached to frame. Virtually every day I have to reattach it. It's a pain.3) It's not very comfortable for the kid. The seat sits very upright, so head drooping and bobbing is a definite problem while napping. I can't imagine this would work well for an infant.I've probably owned at least 7 different car seats over time and I find this one to be the most annoying."
3,OK but shows through T-shirts,"This is an OK bra for a full-figured woman looking for something to give support without being uncomfortable or unattractive. If you have much cleavage, however, it can give you a kind of double-line under T-shirts and smooth tops: one line for the bra edges in front, another for the breast just above it. They had an earlier model that didn't have this problem. I returned mine and went with the Champion double dry powerback instead."
4,Great Everyday Bra,"Now that I am over 50 I have discovered the great comfort in a sports bra. Sure, it's not a silky little slip of a thing but this bra is so comfortable that I am happy to wear it for almost every day. I am active in my daily life and I really appreciate not having to change into a different setup when I head out for a brisk walk, etc. The underwire in particular is shaped well and not binding. I am a small 36C and got the 34/36 C/D. I was worried that it would be too large of a cup, but it is perfect"
5,Best Bra Ever!,"They last! I needed something that would work for me to work out in, and I've found a gem! I'll be buying this brand again, for sure!"
2,Not supportive enough for bigger cup sizes,"After having this Champion bra recommended to me by a friend and reading the positive reviews on Amazon, I decided to give it a shot. This was promptly returned after I tried it on. I did not feel like this bra provided enough support for a high-impact activity like running. I ended up purchasing the Fiona bra by Moving Comfort and now I believe a sports bra without adjustable straps will always be inferior."
2,Not for high impact activities,"This bra is comfortable, but definitely NOT for high impact activities like running. I got the 36-38 C/D and wore it for a run this morning - painful, to say the least! Of course now I've worn it so I can't return it, so I guess I'll wear it for lower impact sports like yoga, pilates and maybe walking. I also ordered the Champion 360 max support bra and that one is MUCH better at providing support while running. Overall I am disappointed with this bra, as it definitely does not provide maximum or even high support."
4,good bra but...,"This is my fourth double dry bra from champion and it does not disappoint, but, unlike my other bras when I washed this one, the underwire lost it's shape. I have never had a problem washing them before and I line dry them, but I am going to only hand wash it now b/c of this issue. Just be warned, you may want to hand wash vs. machine wash b/c the underwire tends to try to dislodge."
5,Merriam Webster's Legal Secretaries Handbook,The book was in excellent shape when I received it. I am most pleased with the quick delivery of the product. I would recommend this seller to others.
4,Exactly what I was looking fe,"Product arrived just as pictured. The tip had broken off two of the sticks, but 36 were more than enough for my party."
5,EXCELLENT INFORMATION EXPLAINED SIMPLY,THIS BOOK HAS INSPIRED ME TO MAKE SOME HEALTHY CHANGES IN MY DAILY ROUTINE. I AM PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN FURTHER EXPLORING THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF MICROWATER.
5,All you need for Great health.,"Daniel Reid take a bow! This book was the best health book ive read and ive read alot of health books. Ive been looking at some of the methods that Daniel talks about in his book for sometime, however Daniel pieced it all together for me to make it all much clearer.If you want to live a happy non disease life, cure cancer or any other health condition, then this book is a must!!!!!!Well done Daniel Reid."
2,Heroine was very annoying,This book left me feeling blah. If Lavinia had lied or deceived Garrick one more time I would have thrown the book out the window. At the end I was left feeling as though there was no way that she could ever redeem herself and that she definitely did not deserve the hero.
1,shoulda stayed with 3-6,"this album was aweful. the only good track is ""trying to keep my sanity"" the producers are wack and the lyrics have fallen off. Scan Man used to be tight. now his lyrics don't even sound like rap. they don't even sound like music. it sounds like someone dying on a track. truly a waste of money."
4,"Terrific book, a little slow in the middle","""List of 7"" is a terrific book. It's a fun read, and a real page-turner for most of the book. It should be especially interesting for fans of Sherlock Holmes, since it weaves some elements of Arthur Conan Doyle's life and imagined inspirations for his great detective, as well as for Dr. Watson. It also weaves in another real famous writer from the same era, as well as a cameo appearance by Queen Victoria and her grandson.My only complaint is that the book starts off with a bang, and finishes with a real flourish, but it slowed down dramatically in the middle, and got slightly tedious for a couple of chapters. But it's definitely worth the read, and is one of the best novels I've read in quite some time."
2,INTERESTING MOMENTS BUT NOT ENOUGH,"This book has an interesting premise and well developed characters, but fails to deliver on its full potential. I really liked the idea of a story from A. C. Doyle's perspective with overtones on his writing of Sherlock Holmes and Watson, but the overall characters in the book seemed stilted and incomplete. Nevertheless, the action and pace were good, but the final ending weak and unfulfilling. I will think twice before trying another book from the author."
2,fragile rudder,"I feels this product is not very durable. The axle break easily when it touch the shore. may be, the force is too much for it to handle!"
3,A round piece of plastic.,"One problem people have with the Porter-Cable router base is that the hole in the base is too small to accept some of the larger diameter bits that are now available. The hole in this base is larger than the hole in the standard base. However, the Porter-Cable bushings that work so well are fitted for the standard base opening.It might as well be said that if you are at the skill level where you are using a router you are at the skill level where you can make this yourself. All that is needed is some 1/4 inch thick plexiglass and the ability to drill and countersink three holes. Get this if you want to avoid the hassle of making your own custom base."
5,Router Base - Clear,Exactly waht I was looking for. The clear base allows me to see what I am doing when working on smaller items.
2,Is it worth $2 per DAY?,"The initial problem I have with this product is that a daily dosage (3 twice daily) requires 6 pills. With 60 in a bottle you are essentially buying a 10 day supply. Worth it? Wow....do the math.I would give it a 0 stars, but it does actually work as a dieuretic, just a very pricey one. There are much easier ways to relieve bloating and water weight!I notice many of the 5 star reviewers have reviewed NO other products on amazon as well. That alone causes me concern (red flag??)."
1,Shoddy soldering,"I purchased my Midland radio from Boater's World. In 6 months the radio stopped working. It was send back for repair and I was told it was a bad connection, and the radio was returned, with the viewing crystal broken... useless. After 6 months of chasing Midland they sent me a new control head (front of the radio) and I was again pleased, problems happen and despite the long delay they company stood behind the product. Dissatisfying but acceptable. 6 months later the new radio 'lost its mind' and is now garbage.I would not buy a Midland Radio product on a bet! Bad workmanship, bad customer service = a waste of your money.Try another brand."
5,Router,"I have several 7518 routers and several 7539 style routers. I have found them to be very dependable and repairable if needed, so far not because of the manufacturer but foreign objects getting inside. To make these easier to use in a table the Quick Change collet is a great addition."
2,"Sorry guys, but I'm Dissappointed",I've had my speedmatic for a couple of years. It seemed to have a lot of power but would often freeze up while panel raising - even in MDF and making multiple passes. I hate the locking screw and it did eventually strip out just like every other PC router I've owned. I found that a vice-grip C clamp worked better and faster. I also had the dust problem on the threads. I learned to remove it often from the base (table mounted) and dust it off and spray it with silicone. That seemed to help. I fried it last month while panel raising and had to go back to the small 691 model to finish up. I've had the 691 for 10 years and can't seem to burn it up although the base (is not as high qualified). PC offers a lump sum rebuild for ($$$) but I'm not going to do it mainly for the principle of the matter. I think PC needs to do some updating. Their design is so last century.I bought a Bosch 3.25 this time.
4,Compact Size,Folds up super compact. Sure is better than watching my kids slump over a book on the floor trying to play their instruments. They really liked these stands. Good value
3,"Inexpensive, does the job",It was inexpensive and light and foldable. It tips over easy because it is so light but it is perfect for a 6th grader when she is practicing her violin.
2,A little flimsy,"If you put a book or anything too heavy on it, it will topple. And the shelf that the papers are supposed to sit on is too small for half of my guitar tab packets. I would spend a little extra to get something a little more heavy duty next time"
3,Good for the price but not sturdy,"This item works, was easy to set up, and good value..but if you put anything on it other than several papers it does not hold that much weight, such as a thick folder, even when tightened."
5,Get a grip,"My D-handle base came as part of a router package I bought from Amazon.com. I can't imagine not having the D-handle. The toggle switch on the PC 690 is not very conveniently located. The D-handle base has the trigger switch, which turns on and off without fumbling or taking your eyes off the work. In addition, I think it gives me a more stable grip than holding the two standard knobs on the sides. Forward-backward tilt is much more easily controlled with the D-handle.If you get the D-handle base as part of a package, it's obviously cheaper, but if not, I'd still recommend considering it."
1,"NOT PICTTISH ANYTHING, AND NOT SCOTTISH ANYTHING(((.)))","First of all (noone) knows anything about what the Picts believed, and secondly the Scots and the Picts were twio different celtic people, so naming this book Scottish Wicthcraft and trying to pass it off as Picttish religion was (another) big mistake. Maybe Mr.Buckland really believed this supposed ""Aidean Breac"" and he really thought he was learning the religion of the Picts, but anyway he was and did not(.)Dont by this book its another money maker by Mr.Bucland and Llewyllyn. And all those people that wrote reviews saying it is now a tradition it is not(.) If we knew something about the religion of the Picts we could create a (new) picttish path, but we dont know anything so anyone calling their path Picttish is lieing if they say its ancient at all. If you want to know the (history) of the Picts I suggest reading books by W.A Cummins and Elizabeth Sutherland.Beannachti to those who search for the truth."
3,Take it with a grain of salt,"The opinions on this book appear to be many and varied, from wild support to outright rejection. I would advise the curious reader: make up your own mind. Like many of Llewellyn's books its historical accuracy is questionable, but there is some truth to be found in the general folk-lore. I would reccommend it for any beginning pagan like myself, as a jumping-off point for research and for helping to find one's ""true"" path. Good luck!"
3,I read this book a few years ago,"I don't know if this is a true Pictish path or not, it is true there is little known about the Picts. This I do know though, it does have some interesting ideas and it was somewhat helpful to me. Maybe it would be better to take the information here and use it on it's own instead of trying to say it came these people or those people, I think it can help if used that way,"
4,accessible and enriching,"It's interesting to me to find so many ""reactionary"" reviews here on Amazon, giving admirable works such as this 1 or 2 stars max, then trashing it as if it is totally useless. Don't make your review less useful than the work you are trashing, please. I will also try to stick to my own advice!Buckland's approach is slightly sensational and exaggerated. Now, that being said, this book - like so many of his others - is filled with unique insights, factual data about time, place and activities; not to mention fanciful but substantial musings and experiential approaches to the subject that prove very workable.With many books published by Llewellyn approaching ideas from an accessible, highly useful format, one should glean the insights then move forward into other works to add to this knowledge.For instance, coalescing Buckland's ideas with those of Israel Regardie and Christopher Hyatt will prove a multi-dimensional and hearty meal certainly worthy of your time and energy."
3,"I love time travel books and the Beatles, but...","I had great hope for this book, the opening chapter about the woman who showed up in all the Beatles pictures and never seemed to age really piqued my interest. But alas, we never come back to this story line except for the chapter titles, which are Beatle song titles, written with the T like the T in Beatles on the Meet the Beatles album.I liked the character Roxie, which is why I gave this three stars instead of two. She is spunky and uses her time-traveling ability in interesting ways. But the book lacks cohesiveness, the author tells us in the notes to the book that he started with a novella and kept on adding to it and I think this is very evident throughout the book."
3,So-so time travel book.,"I haven't been blown away by this book. In fact, I am halfway through right now and put it down to read another book. I'll probably come back and finish it, but it feels a little ""children's bookish"" to me and hasn't been really unusual or compelling.One of the many traps that time-travel books can fall into is the ""infinite universes"" trap where every possible action a person makes creates a new universe to accomodate that new timestream. Eventually, this takes all meaning out of any action that the character makes because it doesn't matter what action you take if you have taken every other possible action in a parallel universe. And it becomes tedious and boring.I prefer books that dwell more on the story and the person, rather than the philosophy of time travel and its paradoxes and ways around them.This seems like an amateurish effort. It isn't terrible, it just isn't compelling."
4,Super Reader,"Feisty female's timefaring dimensional adventures.Roberson cites Moorcock as one of his influences, among others, and this is reasonably clear, and as he mentions, it is definitey more Second Ether than Jerry Cornelius. The family relations in the Bonaventure brood are certainly pretty normative compared to the Cornelius clan, as long as your normative sort of family is more Buckaroo Banzai than leave it to beaver."
4,A Great Starting Point,"Rory Gallagher may have been the lost slide guitar master of all time, but those who did find (through friends recommendations I have found) are pretty rabid about the man.Starting with the more subdued TATTOOED LADY, he then peals into the powerful CRADLE ROCK, then slows down again for 20:20 VISION, the jazzy THEY DON'T MAKE THEM LIKE YOU ANY MORE, then into three classic Rory songs: LIVIN LIKE A TRUCKER, SLEEP ON A CLOTHES LINE. and the slide masterpiece WHO'S THAT COMIN.This is the first album by what I consider Rory's BEST band and this album and BLUEPRINT are the most focused and dynamic the would make. If you're new to Rory Gallagher, this is a great starting point. If you KNOW Rory, don't hesitate; replace your scratchy vinyl NOW!"
5,They don't make them like this anymore,"Out of a really strong catalogue of great Rory albums, I think I'd pick this one as my favorite. And that's coming from someone who adores all his albums up through ""Photo Finish"" (out of his subsequent albums, I only have ""Top Priority"" and ""Jinx,"" and although they are really good, I prefer Rory's work before then). Every song stands out on Tattoo, is excellent. ""Livin' Like a Trucker"" may be my all-time favorite Rory rocker. ""Clothesline""'s rhythm ran as an endless loop inside my head as I ran a recent half-marathon; Rory definitely made ""great music to run to."""
3,The Real Work of Art in this Movie is Kate Beckinsale,"The reason I gave this DVD 3 stars instead of 2 is because of Kate Beckinsale and Barcelona. She is what keeps this weakly written murder mystery from turning into the kind of movie where the audience gets up to leave halfway thru after they've figured out ""the butler did it"" before the actors have. She's totally unbelieveable in the role of an art restorer, blowing cigarette smoke and sneezing all over a supposedly priceless work of art. Instead, Beckinsale comes across as a 19-yr-old art student fiddling around with a 500-yr-old treasure...albeit she is a very attractive one, with or without her clothes on. I also found it interesting that she has a different outfit on in just about every scene, except for the ones where she's wearing virtually nothing. Anyway, the shots of Kate and the city of Barcelona are what kept my interest. A word of advice, keep the sound off while watching this movie because the music is horrible."
4,"Early Kate, good mystery","This movie is a good mystery, with an ending that I did not predict! Kate Beckinsale is great, and her short haircut and natural British accent are cute.Her couple of nude scenes are highly worthy of viewing as well.For the low price, this is well worth it!"
2,Special Features not included,"This picture is based in the famous spanish novel ""La Tabla de Flandes"" from Arturo Perez Reverte (Alatriste), but the picture is boring, with slow and bad acted characters. This particular DVD doesn't include subtitles,not even spanish nor english. In this case the box announce this special features, watch out with this problem."
1,Stupid plot bad bad bad music,This is not worth seeing. The plot was absurd and unbelievable. You could see right from the very beginning who the bad guy was going to be. The sound was bad and the experience was made much worse by having a musical score that was extremely annoying and had absolutely nothing about it that could redeem it. I would rather listen to cats fighting.This is a very bad movie looking to make a quick buck on the back of Kate Beckinsale who gave an very mediocre performance at best. If you are looking for nudity there sure is not much of that.Skip this one!
5,one of the greats............,"When I first heard ""Walking in my shoes"" I must say it didn't appeal to me and I flipped it to ""Condemnation"".Well one day I put my cd player on shuffle and I was sitting and I heard this sound like no other sound.""You stumbled in my footsteps.""I loved it.I love Depeche Mode because they have that dark side to them but they also have that warm side too.""Walking in my Shoes"" is a great single with great remixes like one of my favourites ""anandamidic mix"".But I almost forgot about the b-side.One of the best b-sides produced by DM.An almost passion plee from David Gahan singing about the one he loves...........but at this time was it a person or was it heroin that everyone knows at this time,that David Gahan was addicted to.Very dark,ver moving,and very Depeche."
2,unbalanced hole cutter - drill press only,This is a very old design that with its single tooth is not a well balanced hole cutter and I have used these with a hand drill only when there was no other choice. The hole cutters with 3 or more teeth have much better balance and cut more evenly and there is not all the jerking when a tooth catches. With only one high speed steel tooth the hole cutter dulls quickly if use on anything other than soft woods.
2,Too much...,"These guys simply try way too hard. In between the flashy electronic sounds they seem to up the volume on forcing you to hear this sound they created you actually get a taste of the guitar style Chuck Shuldinar spent years creating along with other death metal pioneers (mainly Chuck). If you want the raw version of this type of music I suggest ""Death - Human"". These guys get a 2 for the effort. I'm sure they worked very hard on this but it just seems forced."
5,Mastery of music,"Brilliant. Melodic. Brutal. Death Metal, and some Jazz elements thrown in. This is what makes Cynic`s-Focus CD so incredible. From Tony Teegardens screaming vocals to Sean Reinert`s godlike drumming, this is probably the best CD I`ve ever heard. Bar none. Get it."
5,One of the greatest metal albums ever,I first heard this album in 1993 it blew my mind then and it still does.. it's a X-Death member band and they R incredible.. check em' out!
3,they put a spell on ya,"cynic are space aliens.snap out of it people ! thank goodness they don't play this on the radio, the world would be lost.anyway i've been an atheist fan since ""elements"" came out & ""focus"" came out around the same time.i always heard the two bands were similar but never got around to buying it. until recently while searching for atheist titles i ran across it & read the reviews of cynic zombies.i was sold.its kinda hard to listen to. the music is awesome but that vocal effect has got to go.its like somones drowning you,the breif shreiks of death metal vocals is like being pulled from the water just long enough to catch a small breath before being plunged back down into the water.now i heard drowning is a peacful way to die but i don't wanna die. i'm gonna hold on to my copy though ,maybe it'll be worth $$ someday when mothership lands"
5,Good resource for the basic concepts,"Clear, practical and well-organized resource for new bookkeepers and accounting students without bookkeeping experience who want to better understand the accounting cycle. Very user-friendly."
4,Funny,"Another 80's fave! I use to watch this whenever it came on television, it's a great addition to my collection!"
5,very good work,i was watching vh1 and saw a clip of this movie i rented it the next day ever since i been hooked you know this show the world how people really think i was nine years old when this movie come out i give c.thomas howell 5 stars four trying to be black it was 1986 and you know what things will never be the same again i watch this movie and i feel good al over it has so many inspirational parts i wish we could go back to the eighties so many good movies to be made. it makes you feel so warm .its not at all racist we need more movies like this today its a real movie not fake.i hate people that always saw things are racist and thomas howell you the man good job bro
1,Worst microwave oven ever!!! Don't buy it.,"This is the worst microwave oven I ever used, quality wise and customer service wise.It didn't work out of the box. The tray keeped turning while the door was open. I had to press the ""Power"" botton to stop it (strange!). More ridiculous thing was that when I pressed any number, it would run the whole minutes. For example, when I pressed ""5"", it started to run 5 minutes. So it didn't allow me to choose any time longer than 10 minutes, because when I pressed ""1"", it already started its 1 min run.The customer service is even worse. The guy tried to persuade me that the oven was designed to run the way it was. But he could not figure out how to set up a 15-minute run. Worst part was that I would have to pay a $15 shipping to get this defective oven replaced!In conclusion, don't buy this item unless you want to enjoy some very weird (and rare) oven and the horrible microwave."
3,It's Okay!,Interesting reading if you live in Baton Rouge or have history there......otherwise it's pretty much the same story as any other mid-sized American city. It's okay but you can do better for your money.
4,Bridegroom Songs (2),"Bishop Butler musical presentation is an excellent modern rendition of old and new pentecostal hymns. G.T. Haywood's ""We Will Walk Through The Streets"" is awesome. I only wish the on the jacket cover that the author of the titles was included. I am excited about the forth coming Bridegroom (3)."
4,It was a very interesting and informative read.,"I thought that this was a great book. Thrilling at some points, educational at others, it was an overall great read. Keep up the good work Mr. Mason!"
3,an odd mix of songs,"As with some other reviewers, I see inconsistency with this ""Monsters"" series of CD's. Personally, I like some of the softer songs on this disk and that's why I bought it (heat of the moment, died in your arms). I really like 'the warrior' as well, and I think most would categorize that one as a hard rock song. When you take a hard look at this series of ""Monster"" CD's you gotta wonder what ""Monster"" even refers to. Is it the sales volume? the hard rock sound? what? What makes something ""monster"" rock? It really seems that they just put their favorites on some CD's and labeled them ""monster"" because it sounds cool! The problem is that there is no real theme here, particularly with volume 2."
4,A Great Primer in Cult Thinking,"Santa Roga barrier is a great piece of writing. Although it wasn't the apparent intention of the writer, it is a particularly good expose of the thinking and inside language of a cult, and the reactions of outsiders to it.Its also is refreshing in the subtle way it shows us how benign corporatism has invaded every niche of our lives. The corporate market investigations of the Santa Roga valley reminded me of the way Coca Cola pays airlines not to sell competing soft drinks from smaller companies. Why would corporations care they can't penetrate the Santa Roga Valley? The same reasons companies aren't satisfied with 95% of a market.The Santa Roga barrier is not a mind virus like a cult, but something far more organic and primitive in nature. A great read!"
5,A quick read - which is rare for me,"I'm a very busy person and don't have much time to read. Usually I can only manage a few pages of a book per night as I'm in bed, meaning most novels can take me months. Santaroga Barrier took me 3 days. It's not often I come across a book that grips me from the beginning and I can't put down, but this was one of them. Gripping story that leaves you just on the edge, without giving too much away at any one time. Very good read."
3,keyboard is funky (not in a good way),"This keyboard skips letters when I'm typing. Then I have to go back and add in missing letters-its frustrating! The keyboard doesn't seem to be sensitive enough to the pressure of my typing. If I type hard it even skips letters sometimes. It was easy enough to install, the mouse works great, and the function buttons on the keyboard are cool. I like my other wireless keyboard, my logitech one, it never skips letters."
1,return to sender,"this wireless keyboard does not stay connected to the RF transmitter; it loses its connection after a couple of minutes - be it at 2 feet or 2 inches distance. there is no discernable pattern, yet the problem is consistent enough to render the keyboard entirely useless.on the positive side, kensington support was very helpful and replaced the keyboard with the 2.4GHz, flawlessly operating pilotboard 64390. don't buy this one, get the 64390 instead."
2,Hardware Is Not Hard Wearing,"I bought this cd player because it has the am/fm receiver, remote, and anti-skip function. I also bought the jogger belt separately from the Manufacturer. I used it for the first time today. At the gym, on the treadmill, the cd skipped while jogging. There's nothing special about the remote and the jogger belt proved to be too bulky when doing other stuff at the gym. The radio did not work in the gym (the gym is under a train station though). Additionally, for some unknown reason, the volume, at its highest, was actually quiet. I would only recommend the product along with the jogger belt to a walker who likes music played at an average volume."
5,Great hole cutter for recessed lights,"I purchased this to install recessed lights in our kitchen and bathrooms. I've used it to cut 16 holes so far. It's messy, but for the price you can't beat it. don't expect pro-quality; it isn't. But for the home owner installing your own light cans you can't beat it for the price!"
5,"Hot, fast, superb Balkan Gypsy music","This just might be the best recording of modern Rom dance music from the southern Balkans, and that's saying a great deal. Buy it.Ferus Mustafov is a superb sax and clarinet player from Macedonia. He performs modern Rom (Gypsy) wedding music in a style popular across the Balkans today: hot, fast, hard and loud, blending Slavic melodies, Turkish rhythms and the soul of the Roma.For the 14 cuts on this CD, he's backed by a tight 8-piece band: 2 accordions, keyboard, electric guitar, bass, drums, percussion and vocals. Ferus' chops are incredible: fast, intricate, heavily ornamented melodies interspersed with wailing, improvised solos.My favorite cuts: Dada Sali, an irresistible Albanian tune, and Dikman, with a killer vocal by Elizabeta Tapavac. Staro Chunovo Oro is lovely, and it's hard to stay seated during Tikino. Fabulous party music -- crank it up!"
3,LOW END GOOD,"THE GLADIUS IS LIKE MANY OF THE SWORDS THAT ARE COMING FROM THE INDIA PAKASTAN AREA. THE BASIC DESIGN IS FAIRLY ACCURATE, BLADE SHAPE AND MEASUREMENTS. THE BLADE IS PROBABLY NOT TEMPERED OR HARDENED, SO I WOULD NOT CALL IT ""BATTLE READY."" THE TANG, WHILE FULL LENGTH IS SMALL THIN AND WEAK. A COUPLE OF GOOD HITS WOULD MAKE IT BREAK. IT IS ALSO TOO SMALL A DIAMETER AND LENGTH, BUT THIS MAY BE HISTORICALLY ACCURATE.THE PRICE IS ALSO A LITTLE STEEP. SINCE THE MANUFACTURER IS PROBABLY PAYING 10-20 BUCKS FOR IT AND SENDING IT OVER. I KNOW THE RISK FOR THEM IS HIGH AND A SMALL MARKET, BUT THIS IS A SIMPLE SWORD.THE SCABBARD IS A JOKE.IN THE END I WILL REMOVE THE HANDLE, AND TANG, MAKE A NEW HANDLE THAT FITS MY HAND AND WONT BREAK AND HAVE THE THING SHARPENED. DON'T KNOW IF I CAN HAVE IT TEMPERED AND HARDENED. THE SCABBARD WILL BE STRIPPED. AND MADE MORE ACCURATE.OVERALL, WORTH ABOUT $40.00 WITH SHIPPING, NOT $60.00"
2,Proceed with caution.,"Suppose you had a technical question, well you couldn't ask the author because there is no contact info. This book assumes that you have an advanced understanding of OWC and so leaves out much of the basic stuff, but does not give you any advanced stuff outside of charting(chapters 2 - 5). This book is also not spell-checked, so expect muddled english and incoherrencies that create a distraction. On the plus side, the book does offer some nifty approaches to programming charts in ASP. The techniques may be loosely ported to ASP.NET."
2,"No Code Download, No Contact Info, Omissions","There are omissions that should not have been made.For Example: For the Spreadsheet component in the section titled ""Getting Data into the Component"", there's no mention of the Spreadsheet.XMLData nor Spreadsheet.XMLUrl Properties.As far as I know ""Office XP"" is mentioned in the book title.And yes, where is the code download?"
5,Clear Rubber Bumper pads,"Exellent product, well below the cost of local retail. Shipped promptly and arrived in good condition. ThanksDavid J. Ginsberg, MD"
4,Micro suede down blanket review,"I like it! Warm, soft and the right color. Fits my queen size bed perfectly."
1,Oh Please!,"What a bunch of groupie drivel!When I read a book about McCartney, I want to know about the HIM, not how a celebrity chaser staked her claim to her own corner of the McCartney fortune. The photographs are amatuerish and proof that with enough kodak film and a enough money or fast talking to get front row seats anyone can claim to be a ""professional"".Thank god I don't depend on ordering all my books online. All this took was a quick flip-through at the local bookstore to know immediately it would be a total waste of my money."
5,AWESOME PICTURES !,"Wow! Just looking through this book brings back the excitement from seeing McCartney live back in '89-'90 and '93! Incredible pictures from all different shows! This book is unique in that it is mostly written by fans who attended the various shows that the pictures go with. A lot of silliness and a lot of fun! Little extra notes depict interesting details of certain shows like: Paul falling over while playing a guitar solo, Stevie Wonder/Ringo Starr joining him on stage, the lights go out at a show, Paul speaking to fans in the audience, etc. But in the end, I always come back to look at the pictures. This is the best McCartney picture book ever made... and one of the most fun Beatles/McCartney books on the market. This is the ultimate concert souvenir for any McCartney fan!"
5,Saved my blender,"I cracked the plastic base to my brand new blender by leaving it in the dish water too long. Being able to order this base that seems to fit any Oster blender, really saved me a lot of expense."
2,Slow Burn Fitness Book,"Title of book: Slow Burn Fitness Revolution.As described to me, it wasn't what I expected. I was disappointed.I need to pick it up again and give it more time?Mrs. S.Allen"
2,Not enough exercise for me,"I read this book and tried the routine for a while. I've always lifted weights so this part of the routine was nothing new for me. The book recommends 30 minutes maximum in one week, which I found to be not enough at all for me. I did 15 minutes one day and then 3 days later did another 15 minutes. I hardly felt like I was doing anything, even when pushing myself with the heavy weights as they recommend. Then, after the 30 minutes there was no time left for cardio, even though they don't recommend it.I was really disappointed in this book because I was hoping that 30 minutes would be the quick fix I need. I guess we could all use the extra time by having such a short workout but I found that my fitness level and energy level was compromised.I switched back to my old routine of 5 days a week and prefer it."
5,Turns exercise world upside down,"Several years back, Drs. Michael and Mary Dan Eades were instrumental in destroying the myth of the low-fat, high-carb diet. In that regard, they are pioneers in the often-confusing field of nutrition, and have helped countless thousands of people get their health---and waistlines---back on track.Now the doctors, along with Frederick Hahn, do the same thing for exercise. Forget everything you think you know about aerobics and the ""no pain, no gain"" mentality behind weight lifting. In exceptional, easy-to-understand detail, they explain how their Slow Burn method not only offers superior metabolic advantages, but how you can achieve them in a mere 30 minutes per week. Their logic behind this seemingly inadequate period of time holds up---it makes sense.I highly recommend Slow Burn to anyone who has always felt in their gut (no pun intended) that there HAS to be a better, more efficient way to get in shape."
4,sensible exercise program anyone can do,"first of all this is a quick read and the explanation of why it works is convincing. I have tried the exercises at home with minimal weights. I don't attend a gym. The exercices done correctly as outlined in the book will have amazing impact on you. some of them are very hard to do others are not depending on your body. I didn't read the portion on doing these in the gym but I am sure it will produce better results if you follow their suggestions.As far as the diet portion of the book, I didn't pay much attention to it. I have read many books on food, nutrition, vitamins and minerals and what is offered here is minimal but probably not bad for you. so overall this kind of exercise program is certainly appealing to those who are tired of the aerobic approach and certainly takes less time. the book does explain why the aerobic exercise does not produce lasting and satisfying results physically."
5,A far-reaching musical vision,"This is a fabulous recording...! I was fascinated from the first sounds, as the composer's experiences and visions, inspired by India and Tibet, came to life and enveloped me. I know I will be listening to this CD often for years to come, discovering deeper subtleties and finer nuances every time I revisit this stunning work by David Parsons."
2,Topflight Copper Tripple Tube Feeder,I expected this feeder to be made of heavy copper. Instead it is made of plastic that is copper colored. It is flimsy and the squirels broke the bottom off of it right away. Not squirel proof! I have put the bottom back on and I am still using it until it totally falls apart.
2,Product Material,"I ordered this for my mother as a gift for her birthday. Wanted something that held a good amount of seed since she is 95 and continually having to go out to fill a feeder in the winter is not easy. When I saw this item and read the information it said made of acrylic and copper. I thought since it showed the feed ports in copper that meant metal copper and not plastic. The small red squirrels and chipmunks(she has many)will have a field day with this. I give the ""plastic"" a very short life as they will definately chew their way through. Wish I had paid better attention!!!"
2,Topflight Bird Feeder,"This feeder is very, very difficult to take apart for cleaning. The tabs on the feed tubes are difficult to line up for insertion and can be easily broken which will make the tube fall. Also, the bottom feed tray does not snap securely into place and falls out.I would not recommend this product because it is not easy to maintain and is too costly for what you get."
1,Broken product,"This product arrived broken. I returned it to Amazon and another was sent. The second one was missing a part (one of the perches for the feeding hole) so I used one from the first feeder before returning it. Even worse is that Amazon won't acknowledge that I returned the feeder and, despite contacting them with UPS proof of delivery, Amazon charged my credit card for the damaged birdfeeder that I returned.I wrote a review already but Amazon didn't post it. Let's see if they post this one."
2,Good for covered feeding,"I, too, was expecting a copper bird feeder. Should have read the reviews a bit better but I skipped right over the one that showed disappointment for the entire construction being plastic. The other thing that bothered me was the loose construction of how the top screwed onto the base. There is nothing to prevent rain water from seeping in the tubes. Which would be fine for covered feeding (like under a porch or an awning) but not good for exposed feeding in a rainy climate. Damp birds need to eat, too."
3,Happy Birds,"I'm very happy with the bird feeder and the birds are really liking it also, it's nice that there's 2 levels for the birds to get feed from. Only two things I wasn't happy with, is it doesn't come with a pole and the second level didn't come with the perches for the birds to sit on."
4,Good bird feeder,No way to review a new three-tube bird feeder. The test will be how long it lasts. They usually don't last long. I hope this one does.
2,Deceptive advertising.,"The feeder is advertised as made of copper - not only at Amazon but in many other sites that sell it. Many people, including me, have been led to believe they were buying a copper feeder when it is made of copper colored plastic. I could not return it because the shipping to return it would have cost me almost as much as I paid for the feeder. Don't buy it for the copper content, buy it for other reasons if you must."
1,bird feeder,"Only copper in this feeder is in the tube. Ad has you thinking top and bottom is copper but it is not. it is plastic. might as well buy the plastic feeder to start with, it's cheeper.Last three orders I have done with Amazon have been broke or would not work. Getting tired of throwing things in the trash. Hate to say it but I am about done with Amazon. They are not the company they were a few years ago."
4,where's the english dubbed version???,"this was a fun movie michelle yeoh is in it, that's all that matters. i just wished that they would stop with the subtitles and dub it in english for region 1 viewers."
4,Poor print quality,"This bible is a pleasure to hold in your hands (Black Goatskin Leather). I was concerned that the size of the type would be too small, but that was not the case at all. As another reviewer pointed out, the print quality was poor. The letter shapes were slightly distorted (not laser printer crisp) and small portions of some letters were missing, The text is easy to read, but still a disappointment to a graphic designer/typographer who's profession involves noticing such imperfections. I will be keeping the Bible because I trust Cambridge to get the scripture itself right, which is obviously the most important consideration. I don't have the same faith in other publishers in that regard."
2,Do Me Right by The Detroit Emeralds,My hubby and I were going down memory lane and could not find our copies of Do Me Right and Feel the Need by the Detroit Emeralds. We went to Amazon and found the CD. We should have had our son download just the songs. $24.98 is alot to spend for two great songs on a dismal CD
2,Not all 25 x 20 x 4 are the same,"these are actually 3 1/4 inch or so, and did not fit my trane a/c. They are even a bit small around the outsides as well as too thin. tried to modify them a bit with cardboard and duct tape to no avail. Dropped them by goodwill and hope someone can find a fit for them."
1,Not worth for the $,This is the worse product I purchased in Amazon. Not worth for the money. The actual size is much smaller. It is not 20 X 25 X 4 and I don't consider this is a Merv 12 level air filter. I bought 6 to save the cost since I have 4 furnaces in my house within the main building and my cabana. The cardboard material is not as strong material as you can find in retail store. Poor quality stuff. Very disappointed on this purchase.
4,"CD, Rod McGaha, ""The Trumpet Sounds""","Well done CD, In my opinion, MrMagaha is a very talented artist and composer. I enjoy listening to this cd."
4,A good read.,i think this was a good read to learn about what it is like being a nanny in today's day and age. The joy one gets of it and the challanges. I think it's worth reading. The only thing I disagree with is the bad words used in the book.
4,Great,"I loved this book. It was fascinating to read, both funny and heartrending at times. I highly recommend it."
3,Fun but frivolous,"Nanny Diaries is a dark comedy about a nanny's (appropriately named Nan) trials and tribulations with a dysfunctional offspring of a wealthy, indifferent upper crust New York couple.An alledgedly accurate portrayal of some of the experiences of the authors' real-life experience as nannies, the book is an irreverant look at life in the rich lane and the children who get run over in the process.The book is at its best when it focuses on the crazy goings-on in the ""X"" household and grows tedious when exploring Nan's non-work life.Overall, it is an entertaining, mindless read, but does not live up to the hype surrounding its publishing."
2,Mostly Depressing,"Although I found myself chuckling at a few situations that Nan was in or phrases she used, I was for the most part saddened at what I read. If this book represents a semi-factual basis of what a nanny and the child he/she cares for has to endure, then it is truly depressing. I was practically in tears seeing how Grayer was so badly neglected and ignored. Maybe a few years ago, I would have found this book more amusing, but after having a child of my own, it's not so funny. I can't imagine hiring someone to look after my child hours and hours on end without me so much as giving a hug. While I appreciate the authors' enlightening the audience on how some of the other half lives, I don't understand how this book has been labeled as ""light"" and ""funny""."
2,Good Pool-side reading only.,This story doesn't require a lot of thought. It just ambles along and leads to a predictable end. The book was loaned to me and I am glad I didnt purchase it - it was a quick and dirty beach read but was not suitable for holing up in the winter for some serious reading.
2,"oh, please","I had to force myself to finish reading this book! I never felt anything for any of the characters--even the kid. Poor character development, unbelievable coincidences. Okay, so maybe the rich are different. Is that news? It certainly isn't a novel idea! They dress better, eat better and live better than the rest of us--but does it make them interesting? Apparently not!"
2,Too predictable,"300 pages of tremendously predictable story. I read half the book expecting more, unfortunately the author did not deliver. Again, too predictable."
3,"Good at first, but becomes mundane","I enjoyed the beginning of this book, but as I kept reading it became more and more mundane. The story becomes repetitive, and it is actually hard for me to finish the last 75 pages. I would not recommend this book to people who get bored easily."
1,Not at all what I thought is was,"I bought this book for my wife who is currently getting her teaching credential in California. She had just finished up a class called, ""Psychological Applications in Education."" I thought this book would help, but I was WRONG.She was coming home each night and explaining to me what she was learning about generational poverty and generational wealth. It really opened our eyes to the different social-economic classes. This class is especially helpful to her as she will need to be able to understand and teach to all students.When I saw this book, I thought this material would be great for her to read so she could learn from it. I hoped it would give her an actual insight to the wealthy class...I did not see anywhere that it said this is fiction...I fell into the trap of the writier and the publisher and the way in which they marketed this book.It turns out my wife enjoys the novel, but I am very disappointed that I did not get what I led to believe I ordered."
4,Engaging...,"I honestly did not start reading The Nanny Diaries until I found out that a movie was coming out this Fall - I always try to read the book before seeing the movie's adaptation. The book is quite engaging with its wide range of characters and scenarios. Many reviewers have commented that Nanny does not have a spine, but aside from not being aggressive enough towards Mrs. X, I think she does - evident in her assertiveness towards H.H.'s friends at the bar and the ""mistress.""The relationship she develops with Grayer is poignant and sharp enough that I felt sad at their separation in the book's finale. I also love her relationship with her grandmother. We all should be so lucky to have a grandma like that!I highly recommend The Nanny Diaries!"
2,Total waste of time,"I can't believe that most people seem to really love this book. It was terribly written, the ""fabulous details"" are really just designer name-dropping, and the characters are all just completely unlikable. Not giving the characters real names detracted from any sense of reality or character depth -- it's impossible to relate to someone names Mrs. X, and it just looked stupid when ""Nanny"" would shout ""Grayer Addison X!"" -- if this were truly a work of fiction, then why couldn't the authors make up names?This could have been a great story, but the book is just terribly written, has no plot and no character development. I am mad at myself for wasting time reading all the way to the end."
4,bittersweet,"the nanny diaries held a wide range of emotion for me. on one hand, i was laughing out loud at nanny's take on her situation with the xes'. on the other hand, i was disgusted that there are people out there that can be so heartless when it comes to their children. this book is a comical twist on a very sad situation."
2,"Even though ""false""...very disturbing","Even though this story was supposed to be false, I got the impression that the author's (former nannies) gathered their material from personal experience. That in it self was disturbing enough, to know that this type of thing really happens. However, the main character annoyed me the most. Her spineless character made me want to reach in the book and smack her for not standing up for herself.Although marketed as a comedic light read, you'd have to be heartless not to be affected negatively by the story."
1,this book is NOT a comedy...,This is a SAD book. I can't believe all the good reviews. doesn't anyone feel sad for that poor little boy? especially with the ending of this book???
4,Great book,"This book was great! I loved it. The stories the narrator tells are both funny and sad at the same time. This is a great quick read, a nice beach book. The whole book paints a really comical picture of upper class life in Manhattan. The book is bittersweet, though. I hope this doesn't really happen (though I'm sure it does). This is a must read for everyone who's ever babysat."
3,Witty satirical expose',"I don't believe the targeted victims of this fictional rendition of nannydom will read it, let alone get the message, but it was for me a glimpse into a world so removed from the ordinary that I had to remind myself that hey, there are people like this, or these girls would never have come up with the concept of writing this novel. In a way, I would rather read the non-fiction version, but of course it would never have been published, or would languish on the bookshelves of sociolgy professors. After all, these are not stories of poor immigrant servants, or rich Arab princesses in a harem. Having said that, I enjoyed the story, and liken it to the Bonfire of the Vanities, but lacking the high drama. I'm looking into the idea of writing a witty satirical expose' on soccer moms!"
4,One of the best books around...,"This is such a charming & funny novel that will make you laugh out loud, tear up and sit in shock when reading this.Nan is a young college student taking on a part time job as a nanny to earn extra money to cover rent, etc. Mrs. X is her boss that not only works her part time but turns this part time position into a 60 hour a week job. Nan takes a lot of verbal abuse and lack of respect from the Xes and eventually at the end goes off on the nanny cam which to me is hilarious!!! The only think that frustrated me a little bit was that the ending did not conclude the H.H. romance very well, her roommate problems, etc.Overall this novel was great and I would recommend it to anyone!"
2,Probably not what you're expecting,"I got sucked in by the hype of this book. I was expecting a funny book of observations and experiences something like Bridget Jone's Diary. Wrong! This is a not-very-well written book that is not funny, despite the ridiculous demands that Nanny's employer makes on her. You just want to scream, ""kick Mrs. X in the butt, tell her where to go, and walk out the door!"" Poor Nanny endures humiliation after humiliation.An somewhat entertaining read, but not worth the hype."
4,A peek at the other side.....,"This was a fun & entertaining novel. It was also an enlightening peek into how the other half lives, both the nannies and the families they work for. The authors were former nannies themselves, so you'd have to think that they draw from some personal experiences...if so, this book was the perfect way to tell the tale and get some things off their chest in the process. There is more depth to the nannies and the families they work for than you might think...this book is a great and fun exploration of it all."
3,Take that posh NYC society!,"While it was quite entertaining it lacked in consistency. Except for the nanny in question and a couple more characters, no one else seems ""alive"". This book is like fast food: you eat it as quick as you order but you don't remember much about it past your last bite."
1,Not even worth the one star!,"I am sure that people such as decribed in this book exist and my question is: ""so what?"" I feel badly that I wasted my time reading this total garbage of a novel with no plot, no positive characters whose only aim was to make some quick money for its authors."
3,Entertaining but...,"sometimes I found the writing a bit amateurish, but perhaps this was an accurate reflection of Nanny's state of mind. What I want to know is whether nanny employer's really are like this? It was nice, however, to see contemporary New York City from a regular person's point of view, and to know that there are regular city folks, like Nanny's parents. I would recommend it to a friend. It's a fun holiday read."
2,SAD,I had heard that this was a funny story about nanny adventures but I found it to be overwhelmingly sad! I had dreams about the little boy in the story. I was not at all amused by the tale. The nanny was pathetic...never standing up for herself. Sure she loved the little boy but that won't do him much good in the long run. Just a totally sad and misguided story.
2,not funny,"I think the authors have tried to make a funny novel, but I dont really think it was. Moreover the style of writing is not that good.Well personally, at the end of the book, when I thought about it, I didnt laugh when reading it, and I didn't gain anything from it"
3,"worth reading, but the criticisms are valid","I, like another reviewer, was glued to this book like a wreck on the highway. I felt real pain for this little boy, however, and I wonder if the vulgar boys HH associated with were meant to allude to what young Grayer would be when he got older. Or perhaps HH was a symbol of hope; maybe relatively healthy, if spoiled, manhood could be raised in this posh apartment building full of nothing. given the shallow writing otherwise, this is probably ""reading in"" too much."
2,Editing Gone Wrong!,I purchased this book based on the entire hub hub surrounding it. I just finished the book last night and must say I am sadly disappointed. The plot is very disjointed especially concerning the supposed boyfriend although how they went from hating each other to being serious is beyond me. The editors did a poor job of making a potentially great story very weak. There were too many plot assumptions made and for that I wouldn't recommend it!
3,a fun read,"I watched the movie and I read this book. I think this book is for those who had been a nanny/babysitter, otherwise you may skip the book and just watch the movie. As I had some babysitting experience, I enjoy reading this book. I'm fortune enough that none of my employer was as demanding/bitchy as Mrs. X. The middle of the story was kind of slow moving, but overall quite entertaining."
2,The Nanny diatribes,"These 20-year-olds raising other people's children should take themselves off the market and do those kids a favor. I felt the book was a long drawn out whine. Wait until you have your own kids and start setting boundaries. Your parents were right, quit the job and find something better. Don't try to entertain people with behind the scenes garbage."
4,"Dark, but right on!","I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves peeking into other people's worlds. I cannot believe that people actually live like the characters do in this book! While it can be dark at times, it is just such an interesting read that it had me hooked the entire time. Great summer read!"
1,PLEASE...What is all the fuss?,"A sophmoric attempt at best. I was excited to read this book and had great hopes for it. As a mother who has used nannys and as a former nanny myself, I was all set for some fun light reading. I enjoy ""first"" novels from up and coming young women writers and tend toward the genre. What a disappointment. The saddest thing, I think, is that the protaganist herself, is Mrs. X - just give her ten years. The authors don't even see it. Sad."
5,Entertaining and Addictive!,"I found myself totally sucked into this book and the world of Nan and her experiences with a Mrs. X and co. It's both hilarious and horrifying to see how uppper Manhattan so-called mothers raise their children -- or pay someone else to raise them. The 4-year old, Grayer, is just another fashion/social strata acessory to Mrs. X. But what makes this book so enjoyable to read is the writing, which is direct and simple and clear. This book is very entertaining -- and I felt myself totally addicted to it after the first five pages. Read it! I promise you'll enjoy it! Also recommended: WILL@epicqwest.com by Tom Grimes, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez"
3,Beware the ending!,"I too found this book addictive but disturbing. I could not put it down at first then I realized about 50 pages from the end that there was no way it was going to end well. It broke my heart and made me ill to think that there are people out there who treat their children so hideously and then dismiss the only person that cares about them (the nanny) on a whim. I wanted to smash Mrs. X in the face and wish ""Nanny"" had grown a backbone and at least told her what a horrible person/mother she was (as if she would have cared). For those of us with young children who strive everyday to give them the love and attention they need to become happy secure adults, this book is a real downer."
3,fun but ultimately too sad,This book isn't meant to be deep -- it's fun and absorbing and the details of the Xes lifestyle make for a good read. But what happens to Grayer (the nanny's 4-year-old charge) is ultimately too disturbing to make me recommend the book. At least the puppy was saved....
3,This was a little TOO over-the-top.,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, I had heard a lot of good buzz about it. I am sorry to say that it ended up as a somewhat disappointing experience for me. Yes, I can see the humor in it all, but I feel that the extreme exaggerations went too far. I feel it could have been funny, maybe even funnier, if some of the characters had been toned down just a notch or two."
3,mixed review,"This is a can't-put-it-down, deliciously nasty look at the very rich and their relationship to their children. If you liked Bridget Jones Diary, you'll like this book (though possibly not as much). The prologue is extremely funny. After that, it does go down hill a bit. The book would have been much funnier if the characters had been more believable. Yes, the comic style is exaggeration, but it goes too far. The Dad is especially unbelievable. If only out of sheer egocentrism, the man would take some interest in his child. The end is disappointing. Nobody in the novel grows up, and we are left feeling angry and sad. (Hence, this review.)"
2,Awful!,"I was given this book from a friend of mine who loved it. While it was captivating, there are many faults to the book. Why couldn't the author use REAL names, rather than initials or the name Nanny for the nanny? (I.e. Mrs. X, or HH). Is it too hard to come up with some fake names?The character of Nanny has NO backbone and this made the novel so infuriating! I just wanted to tell her to speak up or stand up for herself!The writing is fine, and it has a story, but seems to end very abruptly."
3,Started Out Good,"This book started out interesting enough. I think we are all aware of how full of themselves the high class can be. This book definitely makes your jaw drop at some points. However, I did find myself hating the main character towards the last 1/3 of the book. She was consistantly whining to whoever would listen but wouldn't do anything to resolve the situation. I wanted to deck Nan by end of the book just to put her out of her misery. This book is an okay read as long as you don't expect too much."
2,Boring! How could you love it?,"This was one of those books that I'm shocked to hear anyone liked. I read it with the same feeling you get when a friend tells you a long, boring story, but you listen because they're a friend who needs to vent. By the end, I got the feeling the nannies/writers were using this book to yell at all the terrible parents they worked for. Then I realized they worked for over 30 families - and they're so young! Does that mean they had as many problems being a good nanny as the parents did being good parents? It at least raised the question. I wouldn't recommend this book - not enough depth or character development."
2,Be warned...your heart is broken every 7 pages,"This book lets you see into a world that only an insider can describe. That is interesting. This books allows for some laugh out loud moments about the silliness of the ultra New York rich. And then the book describes the longing of a child for love and attention from his parents. A need that is never met. This book is being celebrated as being a fun read. If you have a heart, be prepared for it to be crushed unmercifully by the authors. If I read ""I want my mommy"" or ""I want my daddy"" while reading the full description of the poor child's tear stained face once more...I think I will scream."
3,Talk about ubiquitous,"Lately, this book is everywhere. It is simply not worthy of all the hype. The authors used some clever ideas, such as giving the characters abstract names, such as Nanny, and Mrs. X, and the book does give us a glimpse into a world most of us will never know. But the authors seem bent on making Nanny seem entirely sympathetic, and perfect despite the situation in which she's found herself (make that put herself). Does the fact that this woman spends most of this book acting like a doormat frustrate any other readers (and she acts like a doormat from day one - long before she's formed any attachment for Grayer)?"
2,Disturbing,"This was like reading about a foreign country - one full of shallow, ultra-materialistic, insecure people. Are all nannies this spineless? Are all Park Avenue families this caught up with their image and neglect their families like this? I certainly hope not but I can only wonder.Vocabulary choices were substandard and I can't get over the shallowness of the characters (besides the nannied - Grayer).I kept telling myself to stop reading this book but I couldn't - I guess that's what earned the two stars."
2,Worst ending ever!!,"I'm giving this book 2 stars because it did keep me entertained for a short while. Then, like many other reviewers, I began to get bored of all of her complaining and whining. But the ending....horrible!! I was left feeling bewildered & felt like perhaps my book had some pages left out of it. The authors did a very poor job of tying up loose ends. What happened to her and HH?Also, she mentions that she needs to find a job using her degree, a whole section is even devoted to describing one interview. Then, the only thing you ever here about her job hunting again is a one sentence reply during a dinner party???? What???? Did we miss something? I was extremely disappointed and would encourage you to pass this one up."
1,Why a bestseller?,"I found this book very tedious to read. I guess I had a problem with all of the personal injustices that Nanny had to endure (and the various other ""help"" in the X household). There were some cute moments, and the little romance between Nan and H.H. was kinda fun... overall, not all that it is cracked up to be... I was expecting something great since it has been a bestseller and all..."
1,Really undeveloped characters,"If the authors are trying to write an expose`, then they should just tell some juicy gossip in article or short story format. As a piece of fiction, this book is very unpolished. After reaching the end of this book, I'm still not sure who the MAIN character was. Certain major characters (such as H.H., Mr. X, and Ms. C) are completely undeveloped and the seams between the two different authors' (and their ghost writer's) writing styles are glaringly obvious. I only finished the book because I hoped it would get better (it didn't). I immediately gave away the book.I know this book has gotten a lot of publicity, but don't be a sheep. Don't waste your time."
3,Bought it in local bookstores,"Heard its great, and look up review here ....bought it, kinda disappointed ....read it only when you have time :/"
3,Less than impressed,"I heard great reviews about this book. After reading it, I don't understand what all the hoopla was about. While it isn't a bad book, it's certainly not a great one, either. The character names were strange. I mean, who names their child ""Nanny?"" I have heard of Nan, but not Nanny. Perhaps, for her life, it was a foreshadowing. And, why did everyone but the X family have real surnames?I also didn't like the vulgar language and profanity throughout the book. The story itself was all right. I just was not very impressed with the book. The best character was Nanny's grandmother. She was a hoot!What I didn't understand was Nanny never stood up to Mrs. X. Her mother was a lawyer, so she might want to have her sue for back wages. But that was never mentioned. At least she got a puppy out of the deal.For good reading about the nanny profession, I recommend White House Nannies."
2,"Funny, entertaining pulp","I would venture that most people would enjoy reading this book for a lark. I don't normally delve into this sort of literature, but it is occasionally a fun diversion.High points include humorous anecdotes, shockingly evil antics, and an inside look into the lives of the unhappy rich (an old but tried and true format).Flaws include a slightly irritating protagonist, unrealistic situations, one-sided characters, and side plots that go nowhere.If you can get over the ""old news"" quality in this book, you'll have a good time reading it. Take it to the beach. Sip a mai tai. Laugh out loud."
3,How sad...,"What a sad state we've come to. Although I'd be lying if I said I didn't laugh out loud during some of the escapades, I found it horribly sad. Sad because our culture finds this sort of neglect funny and somehow acceptable...Nanny's are great if only they could stay in these children's lives forever..."
4,My two cents,"There's nothing that I can say that the other 1300+ reviewers haven't already said. This is a charming, funny book that will make you laugh out loud, well up with tears, and gasp in shock.In fact, at times, it's a bit TOO shocking.... and the main character seems to take in all the outlandish abuse without so much as a peep of protest. That fact made this book a little hard for me to swallow, since I am hard-headed and outspoken enough that I NEVER would have put up with a fraction of what she did. I was also annoyed with the ending, and how many aspects of the storyline were not concluded very well or at all (hopefully the upcoming movie will do that better).However, as frustrating as it was to watch Nanny continually get the short end of the stick, and to not have a terribly satisfying ending, I still enjoyed this clever novel greatly!Grade: B+"
2,Confusing writing style,"McLaughlin's writing style is confusing, several times I had to re-read her sentences as one does not know who is speaking or if she is just thinking to herself.She should use quotation marks in a clearer manner."
5,As a mom and former upper east side babysitter,"As a mom with 2 small children, I don't often have the luxury to read. I babysat in NY on the upper east side(different from Nanny, as I acted as a fill-in) during college. I laughed my way through this book, and stayed up to finish it in 1 sitting! One can recognize the parody of types, but people permeated with wealth often treat employees like a lower link on the food chain. I was approached in Central Park by several moms asking me to watch their offspring. I was a complete stranger pushing a stroller in Central Park and they were willing to entrust me with their child. This was an entertaining read and I doubt the truth had to be greatly stretched."
4,"You'll Laugh, You'll Cry, You'll Explode with Rage! :)","I just finished this book, and had to write a review. I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Nanny Diaries"", and would highly recommend it to anyone who works with children or has children. This is a very accurate portrait of the relationship between a parent and her child's caregiver. I could not put it down. I felt like I knew the characters and was really rooting for the heroine in the end. You really will laugh, cry and scream in frustration as you read this book. Please read it today!"
4,"funny, witty, great book!","I really enjoyed this book. I read it very quickly. The author's being former nannies, i know that the experiances of the main character are probably pretty true to life. someone remarked to me that it was kind of rude of the authors to write a book making fun of the kind of people they worked for, and despite the disclaimer, if these kind of people exist then they deserve it! This is a wonderful book, i really enjoyed it."
4,Light hearted read...or is it?,"I just finished the Nanny Diaries and loved it! I couldn't put it down. But, I'm completely perplexed by the negative reviews it has been getting from some readers....The main complaints seem to be about the main character who is pursuing a degree at NYU, and at the same time trying to foot the rent bill, and pay tuition. She had taken on the task of looking after a fabulously wealthy couple's 4 year old son.I completely related to Nanny, the main character, in her various pursuits; career, money, suitable housing and employers who remember her name.The ending did take a serious turn, and turned the focus away from Nanny's adventures and focused more on the family she is looking after. However, by that point I found myself actually caring for this crazy, dysfunctional family (along with Nanny) and didn't mind the change in tone.Good book for anyone, but I would recommend it to college students and anyone else just coming out of school and trying to make ends meet."
3,Cute but sad,"I was really into this book and really found that I couldn't put it down. In fact I read it in something like 72 hours - a record for a gal who goes to school and works during the week. The book is incredibly entertaining, I found myself being frustrated with the main charater's lack of a backbone the whole time - WHY doesnt' she stand up for herself??? The book was cute, but had no REAL plot. It's a simple, light read for those times you don't feel like reading something too heavy. It's like a mindless movie on a rainy day..."
1,The Nanny Diaries,"This was a total waste of time--yes, about 5-6 hrs of my tinme actually, since i finished it in hopes that it would improve--The guy from Indiana had a very articulate review which i completely agree with--don't buy this book-i borrowed it from the library--As a mom who works full time and employs a nanny, I value her efforts more than any of my employees at the hospital where i work. Mr and Mrs. X are real losers, it's hard for me to believe anyone is this self centered, and harder to believe that ""nanny"" (the authors couldn't come upwith a name for her?) would continue to work for them. The reason being that she felt sorry for the dear little angel.I wonder, what was the point of this silly book.I'm amazed to see so many favorable reviews, if childcare workers out there are so mistreated, they need to move on to a better job---i believe many employers of nannies truly value their caregivers--I wouldn't bother reading this!"
2,Can I get my reading time back?,"The book really amounts to very little, just a lot of negative gossip about New York's high society. Sure, that's clearly the fun of it; it's a little like spying. But the book is little more than a mean-spirited extended-play version of Town and Country's society pages. It's relatively well written (of course, as an editor, I know who you can probably thank for that) and not exactly painful, but I wish I'd saved my money--and my precious reading time."
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"Whoever's in charge of promoting this book should get a raise, because they've done their job quite excellently. I fell for it and boy do I feel like a fool. The Nanny Diaries is boring, predictable tripe. If you're in the mood for a totally brainless read where you can predict each plot twist chapters before it happens, get this book. If you don't like heavy, ham-handed foreshadowing and cardboard, cookie-cutter characters, skip it and read something good like The Chesse Monkeys by Chip Kidd."
3,"Addicting Book, but ultimately a let-down, and not much plot","While I read this book quickly and enjoyed it, I could not understand why a woman from a supportive, comfortable family would put up with this abuse. I was getting more angry at Nanny than Mrs. X. However, I'm sure that most of this rings true because I actually do know someone who was raised like this (and fortunately now is raising her own child totally differently, and doing a very good job!) but her own mother won't ever babysit or change a diaper for the grandchild. I guess all you can say is that all that glitters is not gold. Thank goodness for your average parents - maybe they're a little dysfunctional, but at least they care!"
3,Mary Poppins - it is not,I think a lot of issues were glossed over and not addressed in this book. I was totally depressed and discouraged after reading this book .I do not know who was exploited more the Nanny or the child.It is embarassing to think that people actually treat their employees and their children this way .Dogs are treated better by some people.The next book I suppose will be written by the psychaiatrist of the little boy who is so dysfunctional and distorted by his narcissitic mother and selfish father.For people who have not seen the Nanny Scene in Central Park this may interest you . Unfortunately it does exist because I have seen it.
3,Another view,"I enjoyed this book, but I felt it was too hard on Ms. X. First, in any job, expectations must be laid out early. If you NEVER say the hours are too many, your employer simply assumes you are enjoying the extra money. Second, if you are unhappy with the bonus, you must at least mention it. Mrs. X could not read her mind and certainly was not in any shape to try. Perhaps she was not aware that she was expected to bonus someone who had only worked for her a few months. Her other employees had been there over a decade. Nan's mom continued to try to tell Nan the situation was not OK and that she needed to tell Mrs. X of her expectations. Finally, if Nan had really cared about Grayer's well being she would have quit and then gently explained that Mrs. X needed help for her depression about her marriage. Mrs. X was a child acting out for attention because no one cared about her--much like Grayer."
5,a fun read,"This look into the lives of the upper-crust of society, their ""trophy"" kids, and the nannies who raise the kids is a humorous and sad story. Some of the scenes and events are a little outrageous, but it's just to show how unbelievably demanding and unreasonable these rich parents can be. It was grand fun (and sometimes very frustrating) to read about the snobby rich people who are ultimately all unhappy and makes me feel thankful I'm not one of them. The plight of the underloved children is sad to read about. But mostly it was a fascinating and laughable read."
4,The Nanny Diaries: A Novel,"I really enjoyed this book and found myself shaking my head about many of the ""upper crust"" situations written about. My main concern when I finished the book was what will happen to the child in the story and to the baby expected. These poor kids will be a mess. I guess because I am a professional educator, my empathy goes to the children being raised in these families where ""love"" is provided by giving ""things"" and time for children is not convenient. It's a sorry social sceniero!"
4,life immitating art or art immitating life??,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and could relate to ""Nanny"", having been a nanny for a family in London. People may think that some of the situations and/or attitudes of the ""X"" family were far-fetched but they were true to life and delivered with humour. On a more serious note, the book was also a reminder of how important the job of raising children is and how children are affected by everything and everyone around them. They take in more than we think."
4,Spot On,"I live in NYC, on the Upper East side.Not only do I have a close friend (with stories to tell!) who was also a nanny for similar reasons as this book's ""Nanny"", but I know a few of *these* women, and will say - quite easily - that this expose tells it *very much* like it is. While there are many wonderful and caring mothers here in this peculiar subculture of the USA, there is also, unfortunately, more than one ""Mrs. X"" (and ""Mr. X."", for that matter).I'm firmly convinced that the public outcry and lambasting of this book (Katie Couric's show, I believe is one) is only about the shame these women feel about being exposed (mind you, this is about the exposure of themselves, not their actions!) to not only the world, but their husbands and neighbors as well.Four star rating only because I would have like to see a bit more character development of the supporting cast (i.e. H.H.)""Administrative Assistant"" diaries next, and please???"
2,Maybe if they name-dropped a little more......,"So, I don't live in NYC. I don't even shop in NYC. But goodness gracious, could these authors name-dropped a little more?! What did it add to the story, really? Did the mother's Fendi bag or Gucci shoes really add to the story? NO! And for me, it became more annoying than anything!I found the story sad. Some of the reviewers said it was hilarious...where? I don't think I laughed even once!I felt sorry for poor Grayer. I didn't feel sorry for Nanny...who would stay in that situation, really?Save your money, buy something else. Sorry, not recommended from this reader."
1,Reads like Sweet Valley High book,This book is terrible. It's their first attempt at a book and reads like it too. The descriptions of characters and scenes are similar to something a high school level student would write for an English 101 essay. It's a waste of time.
3,Cute book... but a bit disappointing,"I bought this book because I had read rave reviews and heard comparisons to ""Bridget Jones"" and ""My Life on a Plate."" I'm sad to say I was disappointed in the writing and character development by the authors, and would not compare it to either of the aforementioned books.While this was a cute book, and I'm sure the authors were able to draw upon their experiences as a nanny to create the slighly exaggerated ""X"" family, the authors did not do much to develop the characters beyond the obvious stereotypes. A lot of ends were left untied, and the last half of the book was disappointing. Overall, I do think this book is a good read, but don't expect to find it as humorous and entertaining as Bridget."
2,Nanny should get a life,"I remember when I was in my early 20s and allowed so many people to walk all over me, having no self-esteem to stand up for myself. Really didn't care to re-live that experience, but in reading ""The Nanny Diaries"" this is exactly what ""Nanny"" allows her employers to do to her. She's continually amazed at the horrible way they treat her/their child/each other throughout the book, however, she continues working for them until she is (no surprise) sacked like her predecesor. I read the book in just a couple days, waiting for more depth to the story but was disappointed. Reading it left me in a bad mood for several days. An okay summer read, but I don't necessarily recommend it."
2,Poorly written,"I think the writing is really bad. It was very choppy and just didn't flow well. I am very detail oriented and some of the sentences just didn't make sense to me and I would re-read them and think, ""What the hell is this??"" I thought the idea was great and the characters were well portrayed but I just didn't think the writing was good. I don't see what the hype was all about but then again, I feel like it was one of the first books that began the ""chick-lit era."", (which I love). If the subject was written about today...it would be old news. But that happens a lot with chick-lit unfortunately."
3,"Well written, but too depressing for a mother","I couldn't continue reading this book. It was well written, but so sad and depressing for me (a mom of two small children). It really shows the awful way some people treat their children. Not a book for me."
2,Nothing really great....,"There is really nothing great about this book. It's a quick read, partly due to the fact that I skipped through half of the words and yet I don't think I missed anything. I don't recommend buying this book, but it's a good mindless read. definately borrow it from someone or get it from the library!"
3,For me...snooze-ville,"Sorry, but I found this book incredibly dull after all the hype that surrounded it. I guess I expected something better."
4,"very well written, but disturbing","I enjoyed this book. The people became real to me. However, being a mom of three children, one a little boy who loves to play with trains with his daddy; it really tore me up inside. I don't know if I would be able to suggest to someone else simply for the fact of how awful to have children for this reason."
1,Overrarted,I am embarassed to admit that I read this book. I found the narrator and key characters to be incredibly boring and I felt absolutely no sympathy for her. Anyone that allows themself to be treated as such deserves no sympathy. The problems were ridiculous and the charachters were over generalized and shallow. The ending was terrible and the girls who wrote this book lucked out by cashing out - they'll clearly need the money as they don't seem bright enough to do much else. Maybe they can go back to nannying.
1,Wahhh! I'll show you!,"...The basic writing itself isn't bad, but so many of the characters are flat and there are too many loose ends in this book. It tries to have an element of romance-- or does the Nanny just want a romp in the hay? What was the deal with her Dad and the school? Where did THAT come from? And the ending is so depressing. Sorry, I just didn't feel any empathy with the Nanny at all. She should have listened to her mother. Seems like Nanny wanted the prestige of being a nanny to Somebody, was after the great money. After all, what else was the payoff for her to stay in the position? The only thing we seemed to have in common was the pity for the child. But she stayed so long, she let the kid come to love her, when she knew she'd be out on her ear sooner or later.Now, where did the hilarious part of it come in?But the PR firm and agent did a good job. I was suckered."
1,booooooooring!,I love to read just about everything but was disapointed by this novel. Unfortunately I couldn't even get half way through the book because it was so boring. I am surprised by the popularity of this book but maybe I missed something. I regret that I paid full price for it! I wish I would have bought the book used or just borrowed it from someone.
3,Nice to have!,"First four selections generate excitement. The remainder are for the completists. As with many Boogie Woogie pieces the simplicity of the performances reveals limitations of the style and leaves one longing for sophistication. Have listened to some pieces many times in an attempt to find interest in unnoticed subtleties. A good album to have, but it does not contain near to the best of Ammons, etc."
5,40 years worth of Yoga,I started doing yoga more than 40 years ago using this book. I continue to use it most every day. This type of simple yoga practice keeps me flexible and relieves all the many aches and pains of an aging body.
5,My favorite songs all on one cd!!!!,I`ve always been a beatlemaniac ever since I was interduced to the fab four by my dad who was born back in 1950 and knows every thing about their incredible hits so I`m insane over buying anything that says beatles on it. When I found out about the beatles 1 cd and the tracks that are on it I just had to comment about it because if your a true beatle fan you just have to buy this cd!! there isn`t one song on it that doesn`t pass my rating of 5 stars!!!!!
5,Simply the best band ever.,"If we want to make a serious review, we need to know a little bit of music and of course listen to the album. The Beatles was and is the best band EVER, and their music change our WORLD. This is an album full of historical recording from the sixties and the quality of the music is amazing. A must if you like music. Why not to purchase an album that has some of the best songs ever? Really man, if you don't have this album, you don't really like good music."
5,A great collection,"A great collection (27 songs) for the price. I guess there are different interpretations of what makes a number one song (on which lists?), but I figured that Please Please Me and Do You Want To Know A Secret would have been included. But I guess it wasn't possible to include everything. Nonetheless, it's a nice selection of most of their well-known songs and the sound is excellent."
1,"Weak, senseless Lyrics, with Cheap sounding Audio....","Way below average band, that makes corny music. Arn't they all dead now anyway?? Or close to it??? Most of their fans are gone too. So who cares about their music anyway."
3,Too 60's For Me.,"I don't like this compilation, it is truely a lame set. Thus the Beatles only made 10 good songs. Hey Jude would be my personal favorite from the whole set. This set has too many old songs. Thus, there are no guitar solos, or hard rock. Where is that? The Beatles really do suck. If you want a good Beatles compilation, I recommend you to find Past Masters Vol.2 insted.Try these bands insted that really rock hard, Green Day, Dire Straits, & Guns N' Roses."
2,"BEST BAND EVER, but not best collection ever.","The Beatles are the greatest band ever. Period. It is impossible to put their best songs on one disc. It takes thirteen: the number of albums they had. Trust me. I have them all, and they are the best albums I own. You're missing out on SOOOOOOO MUCH if you buy this CD and not their albums, and that would be a mistake."
3,Good collection but can be much better,"Well that can be said about any Beatles collection attempted to fit into a single album. However this one misses a lot of classic beatles songs like 'Strawberry fields forever' among others. I am not a big fan of early beatles and if you are like me, you should look at some other collection from their studio years"
2,The recording is extremely bright!,"This is easily the worse recording of ""best of"" Beatles I have ever heard. You are better off with the original albums from which these songs came from. If you have mediocre listening equipment, then it doesn't matter. But, if you are like me with a decent system, you will absolutely loose your head because the sound is so bright and sharp that it will cut it right off. I have never ever heard a recording as bright as this one! Beware of the poor recording! They should have fired the recording engineers for this. The music of course doesn't even need to be mentioned. We all know the Beatles."
5,GUESS WHAT EVERYONE?,"This CD is a collection of our #1 hits. Therefore, it does not include your personal favorite song. If you have a problem with this, then you should buy enough copies of the single to make it #1."
4,How can you not like the BEATLES???,"I was not born until 1970 but there is no one that can deny the impact the Beatles had upon America. This CD is long overdue and while I may not LOVE every song, there is such nostalgia that you simply cannot overcome. This is truly a must have to anyone who likes any type of music. The Beatles are a classic and transcend decades of strive."
2,Why?,"Gee, what do we have have here? Could it be another needlessly repackaged collection of Beatles songs that, in all honesty, were never that great anyway? Even more mindless is that it is a collection of their chart topping songs, as if that was a measure of true artistic merit.Of course, as I write this, ""1"" has already sold something along the lines of 5 million copies domestically. Does this validate the greatness of The Beatles? Not really; rather it proves yet again that most consumers would rather be told what is good music as opposed to thinking for themselves. In sum, The Beatles were the most overrated (not to mention innocuous) band that has ever existed, and this collection is a waste of time and money.Oh no, I've dared speak against the gods of pop. Let's see how many sheep will say this review isn't useful as a result."
5,What a WONDERFUL CD!,"I am listening to the CD as I write this review, and I have to say that this is some of the best stuff I ever heard! I can't resist singing along to the songs as I listen, and everytime I hear some of the songs, I swear to G-d, I get tingles inside, however corny it may sound. The selection of songs is so wonderful, it has ALL of my absouloute FAVORITES! I am a huge beatles fan, although I am only 12, but I think this CD will convince all those non-beatles fans how incredibly brilliant they are! You have to buy this CD! The beatles once said ""You can't buy me love"" But buying this CD is pretty darn close!!!!"
4,Beatles 1,"I really did like this cd. Coming from the generation who grew up during the Beatles separate careers and John Lennons death, I love being able to introduce their music to my three boys.I have always been a fan and now my sons join me in the celebration of their music. From the generation born in the early 70's to my son's generation of the early 90's this a great collection of Beatle songs."
4,Do I Know What I'm Talkin' About?,"I bought this CD because it contains four songs that are hard to find or at least find in a complete studio recording format. I'm speaking of Hey Jude, Ballad Of John And Yoko, Get Back and Long and Winding Road. The first two were released only as singles. Back in the day I bought them as 45's and they never appeared in any LP formats except maybe in compilation albums. The second two were also released as singles I think but also appeared on the Let It Be album in a somewhat shortened version and performed live on a roof top. The Let It Be version of Get Back was especially disappointing because the song is noticeably shorter than the 45 version. It's almost as if they felt obligated to add it to an album to give the popular song more exposure. Say, does anybody know how much my old 45 versions of the above tunes might be worth?"
2,Day Tripper Is The Only Good Song!,"My Dad wants me to listen to more Beatles songs and albums butthey only recorded one good song, Day Tripper. Last night I waslistening to the Beatles but their music is so old. And DayTripper is the only rocking Beatles youll ever hear! 4 Timesa repeat. great song and music!!!!!! I will give this CD 2stars because Day Tripper rocks!!!!!!!"
4,Bealtes is smooth music.,"I think 'Hey Jude' is one of the finest songs ever made by the Beatles. The Beatles are a nice rock band with talented singers like McCartney and Lennon who make decent music. I was going to school listening to the Beatles and man, didn't my day work out better? Beatles is mellow music."
1,Whatever,"What is with this. The Beatles catalogue is so spacious and varied that you'd be better off going through their work piece by piece. It's ridiculous to think that one CD could suffice. Cut me a break. If you're interested in the Beatles, then go to any of their albums. Then move on to another. Forget these one disk collections. I grew up thinking that everyone knew the entire Beatles catalogue because everything was worth listening to. Do it. Explore the whole Beatles. These one shot disks are in the end not worth it. They are just the smallest, tiniest bit of the iceberg."
4,CD played fine,"Music CD came quickly. Plastic case was cracked and broken, but was as described and CD played fine."
5,Best Of The Best,"What more can be written about the songs included on this disk. They are among the most influential, innovative and successful songs in music history. Any longtime Beatles fans will have these songs on probably more than one release, but the cd is worth the price for the excellent thirty-plus page cover booklet. For anyone who is new to the group, there is no better place to start than here, and if you are a long time fan, why not have all the band's biggest hits on one cd."
2,Missing tracks,"OK, I know we can't have everything in one package, but:there are songs that must have been put on this CD.I don't think that I feel fine, Eight days a week, Day tripper and We can work it out is amongst Beatles' classic tunes. NO WAY! This compilation is a weak effort in many ways, though it's enjoyable and listenable for a newcomer. But for a hard fan as I decline myself, this is nothing but almost garbage.The following tracks are MUST-HAVE on a Beatles best of CD:- Oh, Darling- Here Comes The Sun- Birthday- While My Guitar Gentle Wheeps- I Me Mine (not so popular but excellent track from Let It Be)- Drive My Car- Lucy In The Sky With DiamondsI think we can't have a Beatles comp. without the above songs.This album is just kidding. One of their best albums, The White Album is not represented here, there are no excuses for that.If you take my advice, skip this, and get The White Album, Abbey Road, Let It Be, Sgt. Peppers and Magical Mystery Tour in order."
2,"Great selection, but horrible sound",THis is a great selection of probable not all the bests of the beattles. Caution however : I have found the sound quality rather poor. There is no HDCD and it sounds as none of the recent improvement in remastering has been used. Yellow submarine sounds much better on the Yellow submarine CD than on this one for example. Other titles sound harsh and bass shy.
5,This cd is wonderful!!!,"I'm so pleased that they released this fabulous Beatles album as I am a big fan of this band. All of the songs on here are great especially ""The Ballad Of John and Yoko"" since I'm a big fan of them both. My other favorites are Day Tripper, We Can Work It Out, Paperback Writer, All you need is Love, Yellow Submarine, Let It Be, and The Long and Winding Road. But I like all the rest that I didn't mention. This cd is a must-have for all Beatle fans like me especially since its been so popular over the past year. So go out and buy it!"
3,"#1s not to be confused with ""The best of""","This album contains some of the best Beatles songs and, as it states, all of their #1 hits. However, the buyer should not confuse ""#1s"" with ""the best of"" the Beatles. For example, the Beatles never released a single from the Sgt. Pepper album which contained some of the Beatles' classics (A Day in the Life, With a little Help From My Friends, Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, etc.). Other songs that didn't hit #1 when they were first released, may have been over everyone's head at the time (Strawberry Fields Forever). So if you want a CD of their ""best"" songs, you might consider the Red and Blue albums. Then again, there are so many great Beatles songs that you'll be missing out on a lot if you don't have all the studio albums!"
4,"Great for introduction, old hat for fans","Yet ANOTHER Beatles collection, this time of their ""number ones"" (that explains all the media genuflecting that took place in November). Still, for introducing the Fab Four to BSB/Britney/'N Sync lovin' young'uns. ""1"" can't be beat. Diehards are no doubt squabbling over the selection of songs, but the collection, which starts with the nursery rhyme cadences of ""Love Me Do,"" and finishes up with the gorgeous ""The Long And Winding Road,"" will have kids questioning their parents (and in my case, a Gen-X'er questioning her Baby Boomer husband) about the impact John, Paul, George and Ringo had on modern pop. All of these songs are familiar singalongs, and the sound quality will have casual fans enjoying new nuances to old favorites--and maybe exploring the Beatles' catalog a bit further."
5,Passionate and soulful,"Najat Aatabou sings with the conviction and passion of (insert the name of your favorite singer here). Her brand of arabic music, like that of Khaled and other Rai stars, bridges pop and folk, providing an accessible introduction to North African music."
4,short and sweet,"I have never been disappointed by Maugham Somerset: Cakes and Ale is a light, beautifully written, partially autobiographical story about a barmaid with a big heart, British class-conciousness and snobbery and the literary scene in the first half of the twentieth century.The narrator (Willie Ashenden, modelled after the author, a medical student turning into a writer) is mainly observant and doesn't influence the events taking place: The origins and later success of the great writer Edward Driffield and the touching portrait of his first wife, Rosie."
4,CAKED AND ALED,"Cakes are what aled me, as now ale is what cakes my memory like mud, dry and pale in the looking-glass that's half-full and looking back to see if anyone's looking back to look me full in the face. Whilst this is occurring, the book's pages turn back to their humble beginnings. They're shy (that is to say, discreet, that is to say, English) and poor (that is to say, not well-to-do, that is to say, not American) and make ends meet up with each other inevitably, by design, as the author's hand is the mirror-image of mine. We write trogether--matching sentence for sentence, word for word, letter for letter--pausing every now and then to look back over our shoulders to see if anyone's looking at us--a reader, perhaps, or maybe even two, who look just like each other and just like us, or I presume they do. I can't tell for certain as their heads are turned away from us, turned over their shoulders, looking back, at you[underlined}. Views are full of such views."
1,Ugly music,"I like a lot of Deuter's music, generally. BUDDHA NATURE, NIRVANA ROAD, WIND AND MOUNTAIN, EARTH BLUE, LAND OF ENCHANTMENT, GARDEN OF THE BELOVED, ECSTASY, NADA HIMALAYA, and so on... all of which are pervaded with love and warmth. D is just ugly sound. It's negative, unconscious, full of harsh ugliness.This should never be mistaken for a representation of Deuter's other albums. Meeting Osho seems to have turned him around since, from what I can gather, the albums made during and after meeting him and absorbing his presence and ways express a lot of love, joy, bliss, warmth, happiness which D clearly lacks."
1,Newer model available,"This is the original splitter from iGo. It works with some devices, but not with all, specifically it does not work with the newer iPhones. Their newer model, PS00272-0001 (also available on this site), has corrected this problem and works wonderfully. Don't buy this one."
4,psychosomatic? who cares?,"Whether it's psychosomatic or not, this Bach's essence seems to work subtly. A couple of relatively tasteless drops in a glass of water do the trick."
5,King Diamond,Good c.d. I had this c.d a long time ago and lost it. I loved it then and I love it now.
5,"Outstanding, Hilarious","Absolutely classic, a great own. Endlessly funny. Lots of extra special features. I especially like the commentary by Larry Charles."
2,Not totally satisfied,"My DVD season arrived in a timley fashion, but the case was all bent near all four corners and wasn't what I could claim to be in ""brand new condition"". Disapointed with the looks of it, especially since it is a gift for someone else. Could have been much better."
1,still waiting,I have paid for this item on or around the end of April and still not have recieved this item ! I guess you can say it is lost in the shuffle! Thankyou anyways will let you know If I ever get it! Thankyou ANebergall
1,Why people?,"Why do people love this show? It's ok, but thats it. Cheers The Complete Fifth Season, Diane's last season,is being released the same day as Seinfelds fourth season, but you don't hear anything about the Cheers DVD's. Only Seinfeld. In my opinion, Cheers is a far superior show then Seinfeld, it lasted longer,(Cheers 11 seasons Seinfeld 9) and won many more Emmy's(Cheers 28,Seinfeld 10),and the series finale of Cheers is the second, only behind the finale of M*A*S*H,as the most watched show for an episodic sitcom of all time. Its true. Look it up. But Seinfeld gets all the publicity. That's wrong. I know most people won't agree with me, but whatever."
2,Best of the Pointer Sisters,I like it! I had this on cassette tape and wanted to upgrade it with a CD. I Like most of their work.
1,Avoid This Phone!,Seems like we go through these cordless phones every year. I've used a lot of them and this Panasonic is one of the worst ever! BEWARE the horrible feature of the call-waiting interrupt tone that renders your conversations usless while it alerts you 3 times a call is coming in.Second major problem is the keypad. After some moderate use the keypad hardly works. Many of the numbers require either a light or heavy touch to get them to work. In this day of passcodes and entering numbers you will be very frustrated when you can't do it correctly with this phone.Battery has been sporadic and below average. Programming is poor. For the money you can do a whole lot better. I will probably never buy another Panasonic phone based on this and previous experiences. Good Luck!
3,major loss of vacumm,"I like how flexible the hose is but it only works for veryfine light loads like dust from a palm sander. If you connect it to your router etc. for freehand work it will 1. loses most of it vacumm due to the small hose. 2. it'll plug up due to the small hose.Buy the adapters for your tools but convert them to a slightly bigger flexible hose e.g. 1 1/2"" size flex. Also this hose is not designed to be cut shorter ( 5 feet) to improve it efficency. The fittings on the end are part of the hose."
4,Best Season of Buffy,"I was, at first, skeptical about this season, as I had grown accustom to the previous three and thought there would be too much change for my taste. I soon discovered that my fears were unfounded. I greatly enjoyed this season of Buffy. It keeps to an interesting, dramatic story line and is able to incorperate a good deal of humor that keeps one entertained throughout the entire show."
2,Buffy takes a fall,"This was my favorite show from seasons 1-3. But season 4 is when it started going down hill. And way before it's time, I might add. It's also when the ratings started to drop. It was like they took away just about everything I liked about the show and replaced it with something else. I stayed mad at Joss Whedon for years because of it."
4,College doesn't jump the shark this time,"While not all of the characters are involved and some of the storylines need more air time in season 4, the big bad, thats pretty good."
4,Caught in the middle....,"This edition of 'Buffy' has so much extra that you almost forget the season as a whole is chunky and full of banal fare. Granted many of the episodes are great and clever but the season as a whole is caught in the middle of two exceptional seasons. The season three 'Buffy' is stellar and the best was yet to come in season five. In other words season four is the lost middle child.The extras and commentaries especially on the creepy, and too good for the season, masterpiece 'Hush' are worth a 'Buffy' marathon.Everything about this DVD set is fantastic and perfect for any fan as a gift or addition to a collection. The tranfer to DVD is flawless and there is even a nice disclaimer from creator Joss Whedon about the lack of widescreen.All in all a great collection of the finest series to ever grace television screens."
3,Fourth best season,"I'm a big Buffy fan, but the fourth season was one of my least favorites. There were some good episodes like: Hush, Something Blue (what ever Willow said came true), and along with others. The last episode was great, because it sets up Season Five. I rank Season Four as my fourth favorite season."
2,The beginning of the end,"Season Four marks the point where Buffy makes its dramatic turn from a hip, funny and written shown, to a campy, melodramatic and often dumb series. One of the main reasons Buffy becomes such an awful show beginning is season four is that Buffy, Willow and Xander are far less likable as young adults when compared to the high school versions of themselves. The only redeeming point of Season Four is that is was still better then Season Five, Six and Seven."
2,THE WORST SEASON EVER!,"I just started watching the Buffy series. I had laughed, cried, entertained, and crazed about this series until I watched Season 4. In my opinion this is by the far thee worse season and I was gravely disappointed! I even skipped alot of episodes because it was just that bad. I mean their were some episodes that were good but it just fell so very short of the previous seasons. I will tell you Buy Angel Season 1. This is where all the writers focus and attention was at, trying to establish Angel which is a Spin off of The Buffy Series. Which I will say is EXCELLENT. The Angel series is different from the buffy series but it's wonderful!!! The First Season of Angel however does fall inline with the BTVS series Season 4. So how can you not watch this season if you are a buffy fan and how can you skip a season of a series anyway? but it was a major disappointment especially the season's last espiodes. I just skipped it. You have been warned."
2,A hiccup in a great show,"Buffy, now in college, starts dating and having a lot of sex with her teaching assistance. Heck there is even an episode about those two having sex. The main story of season 4 is about a government agency covering up the existence of Subterrestrials. Mulder and Skul..cough..Buffy and Riley fight a monster who starred in Resident Evil 2.Overall this season is dissapointing. If you would like to buy a watered down version of an X-Files season combined with a lot of pointless sex, this season is for you. However, do not let season 4 deter you from buying the remaining seasons."
3,Stupid People,"Maybe if that guy, GoDwnOnHer had blown up the picture he would have seen that it says Unauthorized Biography. You people amaze me.This is just a normal biography like any other."
2,Does not fit,There are apparently two differnt dust bags for the model this is suppose to fit. I needed the other dust bar that clips on. Found it for $5.00 online.
3,Good Steak knives,It's nice to have 8 high quality steak knives in the house. Useful as a bread knife too if you don't have a dedicated bread knife.
5,Excellent Performance of these filters,The filters are perfect and helps keep my house fresh and clean. The quality of this filter is very good and I am fully satisfied with this product. I recommend this filter for your house.
2,Under sized filter,"I have bought this filter 16x25x4, unfortunatly I found that was under sized by 0.5 inch each side & it did't fit in to 16x25x4 sized furnace. I thought about return it but I had to pay $17.00 from my side even though it was not my mistake.I have not decide yet what I need to do with those. I am so upset with this product."
4,more continental than American,"I recommend this book for individuals who are at least part-time residents of the UK. The book primarily addresses UK etiquette, and when there's room something about ""America"" is thrown in. Much of the book is useless to an American citizen on a practical level, but perhaps a fine reference of another culture nonetheless."
5,Lorrie Morgan Greatest Hits,A lot of sons I love and have not heard in a while also a few that I never hear but now are fast bocoming favorites.
1,Not a Doctor But Plays One at Your Bookstore,"He ""discovers"" the ""disease"" success anorexia.He ""diagnoses"" not only himself but others as having success anorexia.He runs a Success ""clinic""Despite not having a degree in anything, let alone medicine, St. John misleads the public into thinking he speaks from medical authority.St. John is not a doctor but likes to play one at the bookstore."
2,Its alright,"This is an ok video that shows how military music is performed in the United States, Brittan and France. The video was really short and did show the performances more than the narrator's voice offering explanations and information. It is an old video that was made in 1995 and could use some major improvements in the production but is worth watching if you have any interest for the music of the military. When looking at the title I was expecting more of a documentary of military music rather then watching a performance which is what I received."
2,boring,This product has a great title but the video is fundamentally boring. there is little of the Old Guard here - i'd sure want an hours worth anyhow. sorry. sold mine at a garage sale.
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this stereo receiver to power some small Athena bookshelf speakers in my office. The power rating is supposed to be 100 wpc but it doesn't seem to more than 20 wpc. I paid $100 when I could have done better spending $10 at a garage sale. Save your money and get an old heavy receiver from the 70's.
1,Rambling...,No meat. Not a lot of depth. Just words and rambling. A big disappointment. This seems to be just words slapped on pages and put up for sale by a publisher maybe out of obligation?Not really an inspiration for those of us who have not come to terms with being a father.J
4,Great buy!,"Love this pump. I've been using it for 7months now. Haven't had any problems with it. Still use all the original parts, didn't have to replace anything yet. I use it at least 3times a day - sometimes more and have been able to keep up with baby's need. Great pump!"
1,inferior and does not work,"The black base cover does not fit! leaves too big a gap so any fluid would leak out. Thus the whole assembly cannot be used at all! The blades are fine, but the black cover is also of inferior quality. Amazon should take action to remove this product from being offered!"
1,Poor Quality,"Received in time. Except the Jar, all the other items are made with very low quality plastic.You can buy a new blender insted of buying thse parts."
1,Cheap and does not fit,"Plastic cover is hard plastic and difficult to place on glass container and seems out of alignment. Bottom does not fit properly on the base unit and the whole assembly wiggles. I can't believe that this is considered a replacement product - it is a cheap knock off at best. I am kicking myself because usually I will read reviews and not purchase something that is considered problematic and instead spend a little more to be satisfied. I have not contacted Goodman's yet about these issues, but from what others have stated I am in for a ride. Save your money and buy quality elsewhere."
4,Works Well,"As a replacement for our original that was dropped and broken, this product works well! We have been using it almost daily and have had no problems."
1,READ THE FINE PRINT!,I clicked on Amazon to purchase this movie and the found this dealer. I was not aware that it was a VHS tape instead of a DVD. I guess its 1987 again...not to mention the price was MORE than a DVD would be. Seems everyone is out to rip you off if you are not careful!
3,Vas Is Ziss Dope?,"Basil Rathbone, complete viss Churman accent, as an old school chum of Fred MacMurray (! ), and also, unfortunately, a sneaky, dirty rotten Nazi. Toward the end he tortures poor Joan Crawford (and she's on her honeymoon, darn it). Though you'll sympathise, you'll probably also be relieved to hear that good old American spunk triumphs in the end, and the honeymooners go on to happier times starring in James M. Cain movies."
1,liconas christian blunder,"This of course fails to consider that the origin of the crucifixion is a myth, not history, and that mystery gods were often said to undergo embarrassing deaths, i.e. castration of Attis or just being hung up to rot as Inanna. The Roman Empire was host to many mystery cults, each with its own savior god or goddess, such as Dionysos, Osiris, Attis and Mithras. Each of these mystery gods had experienced death in some way to the benifit of the initiate.the daughter of god dies for the sins of mankind by incarnating into lady jessica.before lady jessica dies,she gets gang banged by 4 jewish men.why aren't ideas like this acceptable for christians?"
1,not your French masterpiece,"This movie is real slow. The dialogue is minimal. The movie's major sounds come, endlessly, loudly, from a construction worker drilling floors, crushing walls, fixing windows. The scenes alternate between the said construction worker, staring at the mademoiselle, and the mademoiselle, staring at the worker. How much can two people keep looking at each other, expressionlessly, without falling asleep, is probably the most impressive achievement of this movie. Excruciating! And so predictable: You know where the camera will land, for the next shot! This ""love"" story is totally devoid of love, passion, poetry and vibrance. Some viewers might feel transported to the heavens, watching this movie. I never left the ground. Bravo for the kid, though, he acted wonderfully. As for Mademoiselle Chambon, alas, I couldn't fall in love with her, her violin or her life. The only taste she left me with was not one of a French wine or kiss, but that of an old, bland, sharp baguette."
1,No dyes! No instant nectars!,"As a field biologist involved in hummingbird studies in the SW, I can say that red--or any other color--dye is nonsense! NOT needed, quite likely harmful. Also, I question the instant nectar--instructions say it doesn't require boiling. Is there a preservative in it that retards yeast and bacterial growth? If so it would likely be extremely harmful to the gut of the hummers: it could harm their natural internal flora."
1,No birds came :(,"I had a ton of hummingbirds last year - I got this to go with the new window feeder I bought. I had a few birds show up but none stayed. I did not read the reviews when I bought this it was a buy the feeder + buy the food, so I did. Now I will read a review before I buy even Hummingbird food."
4,Nice to NOT want the characters to die,"I really liked this film. Characters you actually hate to see be killed off, really funny dialogue, and a self-awareness that manages to not come across as snide. No one is re-inventing the wheel here, but this is genuinely enjoyable b-movie fun, and not B because of acting or script. B because of budget. My only complaint is who they list as the lead actress, but no spoilers here!"
1,Stinkport Global Jackass,"I purchased this item in order to modem hotsync my Handspring visor. It has NEVER worked. It locks up during the sync process at User name. I tried to contact the company who, per there web site only offer email support for the product.I finally had to call corporate headquarters to demand a replacement. To their credit, they did send me another modem. To their discredit, it had the same remarkable low quality and inherent inability to perform as the first. Fortunately they were consistant in quality. Unfortunately, the quality was extremely low.I guess that the modem, like the army commercial was ""being all it could be"", however, like some soldiers, all they could be is simply not enough for the task at hand."
3,Good but watchout for the battery power,"I suggest you download ProxiWeb instead of Avantgo (OK but a pain when on a fullsize webpage). I bought this because I didn't want to carry a cable around like the Thincom. The three AAA batteries are a pain. They last about 4 hours before they trash your Visor: Xircom what is up with this? You are suppose to be THE modem company and you need 3 AAA batteries that last only 4 hours before a Visor Trashing: BAD BOYS!!!! I had two Hard Resets and thank God for the PC backup which was a 1.5 hour pain. Since the return time was gone from my CompUSA I decided to get the Back Up Module to make this Hard Reset easier. Well go buy the Back-Up, it is worth the peace of mind. Otherwise while it is working with ProxiWeb it works quite well. I had a blast surfing the Web. Remember to buy fresh batteries and you should have no trouble. Otherwise wait for the Sixpack."
4,"Super fast and easy, but pretty darn heavy","Well, I was standing at CompUSA staring at the Xircom SpringPort Modem and the CardAccess Wristband Thincom Modem. The Xircom was about $30 more, and of course it was MUCH bigger. I'm just about to buy the Thincom, when I notice that you have to use a Dongle. You can't just plug in a phone line. I also notice that the dongle cable is **6 feet** long. So the module is small, light, and not noticeable when it's installed...You STILL have to lug around a 6 foot cable to use the thing!So I bought the Xircom. It is TOO cool! Extremely fast connection, no problems connecting or staying connected. I used Yahoo Messenger, ICQ, MultiMail, and HandFax with no problems. The unit is VERY heavy, but it is extremely solid, and is much easier to lug around than a 6 foot cable.I'll probably sell it on eBay or something when the Innogear SixPak comes out, but for now it rocks!"
1,"Xircom, ""springport""","I purchased the springport modem today. I wanted it because it had a cell phone port on it. Imagine my horror when I discovered that not only was the purchase price of 120.00 but they also want $80.00 - 129.00 for the ""optional GSM kit"" to connect to your cell phone. So that's about $250.00 plus the horror stories of locking up your visor. That's one trouble I don't think I need. No wonder Xircom was bought out by Intel. I don't know who thinks these products up, but they sure must have been asleep at the wheel on this one. Think I'll try the ""new"" thin modem. At least they have support for it at the manufacturer's web site. I sure didn't see much for the ""springport"" at Xircom's."
1,Crashes imminent,"I have owned this modem since it was released. I bought it so I could access my AOL Mail when I was honeymooning in Maui. This thing crashes your Handspring one out of five uses. I have only been able to restore from the backup module I own successfully after a lockup once. Sometimes a soft reset will work, but usually you end up doing a hard reset.The bonus is you can go snorkeling, shopping, and worry about you email when you get back home.This is too pricey a module for the performance you get. Support from Xircom is virtually non-existent. They have yet to tell me what applications they do support with this modem."
4,IT'S A GOOD PIECE OF MUSIC!,"'SUFFOCATION' HAVE PRODUCED A GOOD PIECE OF MUSIC IN THIS ALBUM.THEY HAVE PLUNGED IN THEIR TALENTS! THE BEST SONG WAS OBVIOUSLY 'BREEDING THE SPAWN'.OTHER GOOD SONGS WERE 'PRELUDE TO REPULSION'AND 'ORNAMENTS OF DECREPANCY'.ANYWAY I LIKED THE ALBUM OVERALL ,'BREEDING THE SPAWN'!"
3,Good cd but a dissapointment for suffocation,This is a reall brutal cd but has terrible production i would rcomended for you to listen to earlier suffocation albums and pierced from within to really hear what there about even though breeding the span is a good cd if you want to hear suffocation's best most talent music listen to effigy of the forgotten the cd before this one and pierced from within which has realyy good bass playing with chris richards and really good drumming with dave culross who was also the drummer for death metal bands Malevolent creation and Incantion
1,"Throw this away, buy Squirrel Bait instead","Well, I've already written a very detailed review here about how awful it was for me to hear how lame Mr. Searcy has become in the 15 years since he was the brilliant singer of the brilliant band Squirrel Bait, but apparently Amazon deemed it too harsh and decided not to print it. So rather than indulge in such derision again, let me just say...if this CD made you as ill as it made me, go buy either of the 2 CD's put out by the band Squirrel Bait, and you'll realize that Peter Searcy reached his peak at the age of 15, and it's been downhill from there. SQUIRREL BAIT!"
1,Pretty but not practical,"last year I bought this feeder at a local Ace hardware store. I thought it was just the cutest thing. But after only a week I found myself very disapointed. First the hangers attached to the glass feeders came loose as they are only glued, and in very hot, humid conditions the glue softens. It is also very impractical if you live in breezy areas. Hummers did not like this feeder at all. They could not find the small opening at the bottom of the feeder and the mobile effect made it nearly imopossible to eat from it! Nice looking, but it isn't a good feeder."
4,This Works...But Is Not So Pretty,"I just received the feeder this morning and hung it up in my yard. I put sugar water in the globes, and had a hummingbird feed from it within just 2 hours of hanging it up! I was impressed. BUT, this feeder is not as cute as shown in the picture. It is actually big and bulky. Also, the construction is sub-par. Looks kinda cheap and plasticy."
1,DO NOT RECOMMEND,"I recently purchased this feeder because of the great deal Amazon had on it. When I received it, I filled the containers and hung it. To my horror, all three contained constantly leaked the sugary liguid all over my porch attacting large numbers of ants. The containers would not seal properly. I would not recommend this item to anyone. Instead, I purchased several Hummzinger feeders, a much better design, and am completely satisfied with these."
4,Really Unique,"I love the look of the feeder!! Have had a few hummers, but that's due to its being the first feeder I have put out I guess it takes some time.If it gets hot (direct sun) it gets leaky as others have said. I moved to a shady spot and have had no further problems.On a side note, the seller provided outstanding customer service. Kudos!!"
1,Too delicate & not easy acess for hummers,"I would highly suggest you DON'T buy this feeder if you want to attract AND FEED hummers. It is just too delicate, cannot withstand any wind, cheap hooks and hummers have a difficult feeding from it because the holes are hard for them to find. I have scads of hummers in my yard in the summer and they don't like this feeder(they will go to my other feeder and avoid this one). They like my strawberry feeders best and my larger red feeder with yellow flowers on it because they can see where the flowers are and they like to sit down. So two thumbs down on this feeder."
3,Beautiful but fragile,"Recently I purchased the Garden Ballet Hummingbird Feeder Mobile. The look is everything I expected and more. I hung it from a huge limb on my oak tree by a window using 40 pound test fishing line. It was up for about six weeks when the squirrels chewed the line and it dropped to the ground breaking one of the globes all to pieces and cracking another. The cracked globe will still hold liquid but will eventually break now that it has been cracked. It is such a beautiful sculpture which also has a function. But, it now looks incomplete and doesn't hang as well. I'm also disappointed that the ""hooks"" are nothing more than very light weight wire shaped in a circle which to me is inappropriate for the weight and delicacy of the glass globe, not to mention the price of the mobile which will inevitably be destroyed by it's own design flaw."
4,A Lovely Gift,"Since this was the only e-mail form I could find, I'm using it to find out how to replace one of the glass globes on my Garden Ballet Hummingbird feeder mobile! I really did not want to write a review, but I will say that it is one of the most charming gifts I have received in recent times. The hummingbirds seemed to enjoy it as well.Nancy King"
2,Disappointed by 'Classic Irish Short Stories',"I admire Frank O'Connor as an author, and a prolific author at that, but his choices for other people's short stories leaves a lot to be desired. Character portrayals are flat and plots empty. The book contains little to grab a reader's attention."
2,Plastic and Broken,"Don't be fooled this is all soft plastic except for the feeder hole plates. I received this feeder already missing one of the prongs that attached the tubes to the bottom tray. (appeared to be broken off and returned, then resent to me as a new product!) Squirrels and chipmunks chewed threw the dome plastic, and the bottom tray finally just fell off."
2,Squirrels got a good laugh,"If you don't have any squirrels at your feeder then this is probably a good buy. The poles are a bit loose when you push them together, not real snug. The plastic feeding tube covers get stuck, those the squirrels have not eaten them off that is. I seen a squirrel sitting on the top cover that is supposed to keep them off the feeder. They easily climb up the metal poles that are included."
4,Good for the birds,"This is the same type of feeder I had before. The birds love it. So do the squirrels (which is ok). The only thing I don't like about it is it is not easily cleanable. However, someone suggested that I just dump the entire thing in a bucket and clean it that way. Sounds like a plan. I have not found another one that I would like better."
2,Poor quality - breaks easy.,"At first glance, this is a nice big feeder with the ability to put 3 different types of seeds in it to feed different types of birds. The birds loved it! But, within 1 week of owning it, the lawnmower knicked it and the pole buckled and the entire thing fell to the ground. I was able to straighten the pole and put it back up (at a crooked angle). Our lawn man knicked it again and this time, when it fell, it broke into many pieces. I had to throw it all away. The lawn guy didn't hit it hard either time. The pole is made very cheaply and will not withstand any time of damage. The feeder itself is cheap plastic and will crack if dropped.For the amount of money this costs, you would think you would receive a better made product. I was very disappointed."
3,Great feeder but prone to squirrel damage,"This is really a great feeder. It holds a lot of seed and the optional perches allow you to customize to your bird preferences. BUT... It's not squirrel-proof. Mine lasted a little over a year before the squirrels chewed through the plastic top enough that one morning the feeder and its hanging aparatus parted ways, the feeder hit the ground and broke. Somehow I hope for more than a year from a substantial feeder such as this one."
3,Does not come with cigarette lighter connection,"Although mentioned, there is NOT a cigarette lighter adapter with the product, and obtaining one is difficult and expensive. The shorter model that is available does come as a cigarette lighter plug in."
4,Covered in oil & leaking even more,I received my Porter Cable model 314 today & the interior packaging was filled with oil. The saw leaked out the oil & is defective. I am waiting for Amazon to get a replacement back in stock. Hopefuly the next tool will not be defective. Update to follow.
1,Bad Stitching,My 9 month old labrador loved this toy but in only a couple of hours itcame apart and she tore an eye off. I might be able to re-sew it but I wouldn't recommend it for a dog that likes to chew things. I have a Dr. Noy soft toy that has held up much better.
3,ok toy,My puppy loved to play with this toy but it only lasted a week and a half so I'm not sure if it was worth it. It came with a replacement ball which was nice. Maybe my puppy was just too rough with it but one arm was torn off by the second day.
5,Our Dogs Love These!,"I purchased the small, medium, and large Air Q-Tease toys for our 3 dogs this Christmas, and they LOVE them!!! It's great because it's both a sqeaky plush toy & a rope/tug toy all in one. Plus, it comes with a squeaky tennis ball that can either be used on its own, or used as a replacement squeaker (by pushing the ball into the plush toy) once the original one has seen its day.We purchased the Medium Duck Q-Tease for our 35lb. dog, as well as for my parents 30lb dog & it's the perfect size for both of them.Overall, I would highly recommend these Air Q-Tease 3-in-1 toys. They seem to be really well made & they've been a big hit with all 3 of our dogs."
4,Buen CD - Good CD,"Como dijeron antes, no es el mejor disco de Los Planetas, pero es bueno y parece que Amazon no tiene los otros disponible todavía; así que recomendaría que lo compraran y verán que es un muy buen grupo y así esperarán con ansias los otros.Los que más recomiendo son ""Una semana en el motor de un autobús"", ""Super 8"" y ""Unidad de desplazamiento""."
1,BEWARE: Feeder is not a Squirrel proof cage...,"Unlike the photo, this bird feeder works best with sunflower seeds only (unless you like seeds all over your lawn). Secondly, and most important, this item looks nice but it is not a Squirrel proof cage as advertised in it's name. This is very misleading!!! Until I took elaborate measures, the squirrels had a field day eating the seeds. This made things very frustrating. If this item had some sort of lock down mechanism for the top cover, it may have been more effective. However, the squirrels could simply lift off the top lid and eat to their hearts content. I would have had lower expectations and higher product satisfaction if it were not listed as advertised. The instructions state that you can make this cage squirrel-proof by placing squirrel barriers above and below the feeder, BUT this would be true of any bird feeder!!! In short, false advertising....."
1,If you are interested in this theory,"If you are interested in this theory, you ought to read the original Spaulding manuscript, and compare for yourself. Don't trust the author of some book to determine your eternal future. If you don't want to be a mormon, that is your choice, but decide for yourself. (...)"
2,scary is not this book,"these stories don't even make me cringe.Only thing that is awesome about this book is the crouching skeleton that is animated on the cover.Other than that, this book makes me wanting something more.The stories take no risks at all, but you will if you buy this book."
2,A few shortcomings,"First. the base is very lightweight - weighing less than any blow dryer I own. So I fought it continually falling over. Because of an arm injury, I had to use it, so I went to the athletic store and purchased a 5 lb weight which sits on the base and keeps it upright -- inexpensive solution, but a pain. Secondly, when you raise or lower it, the catch doesn't hold well. So when you reach to adjust the angle of the dryer on the flexible neck, the extension rod regularly gives way and collapses. Works in a pinch like I'm in where you only have one arm. But don't buy it thinking it will improve a two-handed world."
4,Made all the difference,This was very helpful in healing pressure wound for my Grandma. I was looking for something that would be both comfortable and helpful
3,This product is so-so,"The fact that this product has only a few ingredients, which are natural, is great. For those who are sensitive to heavy scents, this product is a definite no to you, as it has a heavy scent to those who are hypersensitive. This product is pure liquid, so you have to hurry to get it to your face before it goes through your fingers. This company that sells the product didn't check the screwtop to it to make sure it was tight, so quite a bit of liquid was gone when I received it."
1,"Lonely & neglected, but the ants like them","The hummingbirds in my yard, skip over this feeder. I have five feeders, and two of them are this one and the birds don't touch them. The other three I have to fill twice a day, these two never empty. The ants love them, I always have ants inside these feeders. The bottom comes apart for easy cleaning, but it also leaks easily and the plastic bottle discolors quickly."
3,fit too tight,"I ordered my normal 7.5 size in this boot, but the fit is much tighter than my other Frye harness boots. They are almost impossible to put on, especially the mid-foot/arch area. I cannot get my foot past the middle part of the foot. I may try a half size up, as these are just too uncomfortable. The leather is very nice and they look great. Just too tight in the instep."
2,Plastic Pulley Strips,"I have owned two of these in the space of 2 days and both of themhave died within that time frame. In both cases, I was cleaningmetal with the belt. After sanding continuously for just over anhour the case was very hot. The sanding belt is driven by a beltinside the casing. The drive belt turns a PLASTIC pulley that isused to turn the belt. In both sanders the plastic pulleystripped and was completely useless. My guess is that theplastic got hot and softened. I am very disappointed in thissander and am going return it for a different brand tomorrow.I giving it two stars only because when it did work it workedvery well. If you were using it intermittently (like for 5minutes max. at a time) then it would probably work well."
2,Dust every where but the bag,"I have used this sander for a while, even bought a new switch because while it was under warranty it wouldn't shut off. It was easier to just buy a switch and put in myself. It sands great, I use it mostly for removing planing marks and sanding out joints.The reason for the low rating is the way Porter Cable decided to solve the problem of dust getting in the motor. I was wondering why the bag never filled, I thought the chanel where the dust goes from the back of the sander was blocked with debris. When I took the side off I was right it was blocked, with a piece of metal put in at the factory and siliconed to seal it. I cut the piece out and now use a vacume to help with the dust collection. This is better, but the impellor only blocks the way, next time that will be removed to allow the vacume to do it's job. I don't care if it voids the warranty, I'm more worried about the warranty on my lungs, a concern Porter Cable should also share."
2,352 sander,My 352 belt sander needs new armature bearings after very light and infrequent use. The repair cost is almost the same as a new sander. My Black and Decker sander lasted for 25 years and I expected more service from the 352 P-C sander.
2,Not a sander I will buy again,"I have used these sanders for several years in my custom cabinet shop. They sand well enough but have numerous deficiencies. They are loud, very loud; not 1 of the dust bags didn't fall apart after several months; they cannot be clamped to a bench for use as a stationary sander. Have been so happy with the Makita belt sander recently purchased to replace the aging 352VS's, that when the last 352VS needed repair (again) I just through it away."
2,Too big too awkward,"This thing is too big to work with and awkward to hold. The profile holders come off the machine during use and the adhesive paper doesn't hold to them well. The H&L paper work well on the triangle foot, but you can get something easier to user for a lot less money. All in all you need something smaller, lighter and with (wire or other) clambs to hold the paper."
2,The Worst,"I am a third generation cabinet maker. I have Porter Cable power tools going back 40 years and they have been among the best tools I have ever used for a given task. They set the standard for belt sanders. This Profile sander has to be the worst power tool I have ever purchased, I don't know why I am even bothering to write this review. I don't want to say too much beyond the other reviews, except that it is about useless for the purpose it is intended for. Please don't buy this tool, but don't judge other Porter Cable the same way."
2,black marks all over,"A good tool with certain attachments, but using the knife shaped tool -- and most of the sharper shapes -- with the adhesive backed paper is a cruel joke. If you're lucky and the black rubber thingy actually stays in the plastic holder, the paper will wear out in 10 seconds flat and the black rubber will rub all over your work. I honestly can't understand how such a ridiculously lousy design made it to mass production. Try again, Porter Cable."
5,works extremely well!,"I had been having some fly problems for a couple of days since it gets hot. i had been using the electric racket zapper for a while and killed lots of flies, but there's still a lot flying around when i work and cook and eat. very annoying.i bought this fly trap about a week ago. with Prime it arrived on the next day. i got it out of the box and immediately plugged it in in my bathroom, where most of the flies were. i closed the doors to the bathroom and didn't open it until an hour later. there were more than 20 flies stuck onto the trap already!i left it on ever since. for the past few days i didn't have any more fly problem thanks to the fly trap. it also works pretty well as a night light in the bathroom.Great product and the best $30 i have ever spent here.p.s i live in a one bedroom apartment so one fly trap is enough for the whole apartment"
4,So far so good ...,"The blue light is a bit distracting in my new kitchen, but not as distracting as those pesky little flies. It's been running about 3 days now and every day we get more and more of those little guys. Very happy with this product."
3,Not impressed so far,"I'll keep this product in use and update my review later but here is the gist so far:Object is really big. Object must be plugged into a wall socket and will dominate about a 12"" x 3"" space. In a small kitchen this can be tough.Object is prominent and unattractive, if you've tried to have a nice-looking room.I have it plugged into an extension cord and sitting on top of my fridge next to the trash, which seems like it would be a good spot.In about 2 days approximately 6 flies have fatally fallen for the trap. There are plenty of flies still, so I'm not sure the expense of this unit and the power consumption make it worthwhile.There is a little gross out factor here. You can see the trap inside the unit, so in exchange for killing a few flies you get to look at flies stuck to a glueboard. Not much improvement!At this point I'll probably return it to Amazon. Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised. I'm going to try the Terro trap next plus a home-made trap I read about."
4,"Works Great, But Only Comes with 1 Glue Card",I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_ I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!
5,Fly Web Fly Trap,This product works very well. This summer was very hot and I had loads of regular flies and gnats. This trap with light attracted them and they got stuck on the fly sticky pad. Neat and clean - just through the pad away and replace it with another.
5,Misquito attractor but not a trapper,"So the misquitos round the hall corner by the bathroom where the light is & go in the bathroom, therefore not making it to my bedroom. Then I close the bathroom door & kill them with a handtowel. Very few get stuck on the sticky pad but overall, it works. btw It looks goofy when company comes over so unplug it & hide it till they leave. no biggie."
4,Fly Web Fly Trap,"Length:: 2:53 MinsFly Web Fly Trap works pretty well for gnats/fruit flies, I have not seen any house fly's yet so I cant comment on that. I would imagine it would work in the same fashion.It's a lot bigger then I expected, and glue board and dead fly's are fairly visible behind the wide slots. The look and size may not be for everyone, so I'll knock it a star there, but it does work for my needs. It only comes with 1 glue board so I bought a 10 pack of replacements with this item, their is no need to leave the light on constantly. I plug it in for maybe 1/2-1 hour (when ever I see any fruit fly's), which is usually when I get home from work around 5pm. Or sometimes in the morning - whenever I spot a fruit fly basically. They will fly into the trap in fairly short order, (I turn off all the other lights in the house when this is on and close the curtains). It's very nice finding something that takes care of these tiny pests all on it's own.."
3,where is it?,Cant rate it when it hasnt been shipped. Ordered three other things that day they have all arrived. getting eaten.
1,DON'T BUY THIS !!!!,This fly trap is a joke. It's expensive and doesn't work at all. I had it plugged in for two weeks and caught just one tiny baby fly. Total waste of money.
1,Flies ignore it,The fly trap is very limited in use. First you have to place it away from areas of light (windows) for it to work optimally note.. windows are where flies are. Secondly even doing that flies pretty much just ignore it.
3,Almost great...,"Overall, this product works as advertised. I wake up each morning with flying insects stuck to the glue trap. The mark down in rating comes from how it fits into the wall outlet. It is top heavy and the plug isn't very robust, so it tilts out from the wall at a crazy angle no matter what I do. I am likely going to have to attach it to the wall in some manner. That aside, it has really cut down on the bugs in the kitchen and so fulfills its need."
1,Does not work for house flies,"I bought this fly trap after many house flies (not fruit flies) suddenly appeared in my New York apartment. However, I found that the flies were not attracted to it. I did not catch a single fly but they seemed to die off on their own. Now I have a black light though."
2,This thing is huge!,"With the changing of the seasons, we had a somewhat annoying infestation of gnats in our Philly apartment.Bought this Fly Trap to kill those little buggers! And... sadly... it didn't really work. Caught 1 out of 5-6 gnats still flying around.My recommendation if you have a gnat problem: Get plant spray to kill them at the source and keep garbage at bay.The size of this Fly Trap is huge, by the way. Looks ridiculous in the apartment. AND lights up the entire room, which is pretty annoying in itself.Only comes with one sticky sheet, which is really unfortunate. I'm sure if you have a FLY problem, it would work great! Or if you want to use it in a barn, garage, or attic? It's definitely not for the in-home gnat issues, though."
2,Case Histories are FICTIONAL,"The author admit in the acknowledgement that the so-called patient cases are NOT REAL, made up by her. However, if you didn't read the acknowledgement, you would think those are real people and their problems are beautifully explained by the author. In reality, she invent cases to fit her theories. This can mislead readers."
1,Terrible book. Waste of time.,This book NEVER took off!! It was dull and wordy from start to finish. She uses a lot of medical jargon. Really didn't benefit me in ANY way. I wish she would've broken it down to fit any reader. Not the case. Hopefully others will like it more. Good luck!
3,"Well-written, not very complicated, full of symbols.","This was an ok book. But I still don't understand why this is such a classic in the world of literature as well as the world of theatre. Overall, it is an easy to understand play, the facts aren't totally entangled in superflous details and dull narrations."
1,Worthless unless you want false alarms,"I cannot change my TV volume or channels using the remote without setting off a false alarm (due to the infrared ""testing"" feature).I cannot put this alarm anywhere near a laundry room, bathroom, or kitchen without a ton of false alarms.Just this morning around 4AM I was woken up AGAIN by a false alarm from this thing. Luckily the thing broke when I ripped it down from the living room ceiling so I have an excuse to change to a different brand."
2,chirps with new batteries,"We had this alarm for a few years, but it was always very sensitive to set off. Recently it has mysteriously started going off for no reason, and now it chirps nonstop no matter how many new batteries we've tried. Am currently shopping for a different model."
1,Terrible - Triggers Falsely Everytime I Change TV Channels,"This is supposed to have a feature where you can silence false alarms with any remote. However, it also goes into full test every time I change channels on my TV. It is super annoying. I moved it to a different wall so it wasn't on the same wall as my TV, but it still does it regularly."
2,Remote Mute does not work,"we replaced our smoke alarm in the kitchen because when I stir fry the alarm would go off. We paid extra for the remote control feature. this feature does not work, even when trying 3-4 different fully-charged remote controls."
2,First Alert SA302CN,SO far 2 out of 3 purchased dont work as anticipated one chirps without stopping even though several new batteries were tried 2nd one went off last night without reason.not too happy
1,Hard to get through,"I found this book very hard to get through. The dialogue with the all the ""hello"" inserts was juvenile. I found the secondary characters very clich?d. I felt the use of the heros needing to be contrasted and compared to gay men to be a bit offensive and totally unnecessary to the story. The gay men in Beauty Queen and the words used in Material Girl became sterotypes.The idea of the story was a good one, it had great potential and their were a few moments that were engaging.I have been disappointed by Julia London's last 3 books and I hope the last one of the series gets back to her old form."
3,clean pop from yesterday,"this is late sixties pop music from a group of young men who could harmonize and play their instruments. It's in the vien of many pop groups of the era and it if you enjoy that type of clean pop made by a real band then you may enjoy this one IT's not as good as say the association was though , but it's decent enough. My disc was a cdr though and I wish people would take the time to put out proper silver discs. The sound was clean though and obviously from records that had no scratches so at least you get that part done well."
4,looks great works great,i was looking for a two piece humming bird because i always remember my mom and dad having one on the door to there porch after losing my dad a couple of years ago and my mom last year the little humming bird was lost and this one makes me smile its really a great figurine.
1,bad bad bad,this movie is such a waste of time you definately will want to see it!!bruce springsteen must be so embarrassed!
3,Boardbook is not as described,"The Board book is a great book for reading the song words to little ones and I love the song, but was disappointed that the board book does not have any inspirational insights or Scripture verses on the relationships between Mary and the Christ child. The Board book is not the same as the hardcover book is described. If you want the insight and scripture make sure you do not order the Board book."
3,nais is a wonderful marketing plan,"NAIS is a wonderful marketing plan if you happen to be corporate agriculture wanting to sell your meat products globally. But NAIS will put a heavy burden on those who own even one horse, cow, pig, or other livestock animal. While factory farms get one lot number per groups of animals and less reporting of movements the average joe will have to register their premises (clouding title to property), microchip and file movement reports on every critter they own. Then if disease is suspected in an area, the USDA can depopulate that 6 mile radius, giving the factory farms reasons to tell the global market, ""see what a safe food supply we have!"" This does not address the concerns that NAIS traceability ends as slaughter which is when many food safety issues happen. NAIS can be compared to a rich man having a disease but passing legislation that the poor must take the medicine and pay for it, then that rich man gets to brag to everyone how healthy he is!"
3,Why go paperless?,"I have nothing for or against this book. I have not purchased it yet because I am a Kindle owner and I am annoyed to find that I can purchase the printed version of this book and have it shipped to me for less than I can purchase the Kindle version for. This is just wrong, wrong, wrong and I won't purchase this or other ebooks until their prices become more realistic."
4,I Like Lois Battle's books,"I recently discovered Lois Battle and have now read several of her books. The Florabama Ladies' Auxiliary and Sewing Circle is a nice, enjoyable read. The ladies each have their own story and their interactions with each other. I recommend this for those who enjoy a good read."
2,This author needed to consider the canine character,"Ok, for the most part, I liked the story and the characters. I enjoy Southern stories and Southern women. What I had a hard time with was how Bonnie's dog, a PUPPY, no less, was left for hours and hours ALONE. And I just read on page 300, how the dog, Nesha, ""gave Bonnie a tail-wagging welcome"", and Bonnie snaps at him saying, ""Oh, just shut up and sit down."" This makes me angry. If one is going to use animal characters in a novel, one should respect the animal character as much as the human ones. I currently have this at 3 stars. I'm going to change that to 2 and not buy this author's books again."
3,"Nicely written, but a bit slow.","This is a story of a Japanese/Korean immigrant (Doc Hata) who lives his life in fear. His fear does not come from a physical threat, but instead from his unwillingness to suffer any sort of shame or embarrassment.As a result, Hata builds a world of gestures, manners, and repetition, and avoids having to actually live. Unfortunately for those he comes across, this characteristic means that he is little able to lend the emotional support that each one of them requires.While the end of the story demonstrates a voyage of self-discovery, you can imagine that the stunted Doc Hata is not the most engaging character to follow around for a couple of hundred pages."
4,Thought-provoking,"'A Gesture Life' compares favorably with recent releases set in the WWII era. It is as fascinating as 'The Triumph and the Glory', every bit as insightful as 'The Emperor's General', yet written is a fresh style from a rare perspective. I recommend it highly."
5,'A Gesture Life'...Coming to terms with our life choices...,"'A Gesture Life', by Chang-Rae Lee is the story of a 70 year-old Japanese man and his occasion to confront what his life has been about. Recollections (mostly brutal..in the least, heartbreaking) of time spent as a medical doctor during WWII are interwoven with memories of his attempts at assimilation into Western culture when he immigrates to the US. Perhaps the greatest impact from reading this novel, was the human face put to the horrifying and tragic plight of 'comfort women', whose total purpose for the Japanses military was to service their sexual needs. There were a couple of times when I had to lay the book aside and breathe....so profound was the imagery that I drew from my reading. I highly recommend this book to anyone who desires stimulating reading for intellectual growth and understanding of history, as well as stirring of the heart."
1,Totally useless,"Wish I had found these reviews before purchasing this product. This will NOT jump start a dead car battery.Is there product that does what this promises i.e., jump start a dead car battery without 1)another car and 2)going under the hood?Please let me know as I've wasted too much time, money and safety on products that don't work (including this one)."
4,How this would help you,"To start a car, you need high current that a car battery provides, either from your own or a donor car's.This device can't provide enough current to start your car. What it can do is to slowly charge your car battery and let it store enough power to give high current for a second.Apparently, if your car battery can't hold the charge, it wouldn't work; if it's very weak, it takes longer to charge. And if you try to turn on the engine before the car battery is ready, you've just wasted all the juice from the jumper to the car battery, and may well blow any chance for this thing to work.There's nothing on the market that you can plug into the cigarette light socket and start the car instantly. Even if the jumper has another car battery in it, the socket can NOT carry that much current.For the convenience, size and independence of a good Samaritan, this is as good as it can get."
1,"Don't bother, it's a non-starter (pun intended)","Great concept, but this little piece of junk couldn't jump start a child's electric toy car (if it had a cigarette lighter). It simply doesn't hold enough of a charge, and what charge it does have takes forever to transfer through your cigarette lighter to your battery. Great concept, but it's a worthless product. Would love to find one that you can use from insider your car that isn't too big and bulky, but actually gets the job done."
1,a junk,"This product is a junk. It doesn't work. Only if your car battery is slightly shorter of power, it may work. In 99% chances, it won't work. In order for such a product to work, such a battery needs to have a much higher capacity. The car battery needs a lot of power. When you use such a product to charge the car battery, other devices in your car will also consume the power. Hence, only when such a product has a lot of power, it may charge the car battery sufficiently to start a car. This product with such a low capacity can only give you a false sense of security."
1,Predator,This books is terrible....I could barely keep my eyes open while reading; as a Scarpetta book you would think that it would be a spellbinder this book stunk!
1,What happened to Kay Scarpetta?,"The last few of Patricia Cornwell's books have left alot of us who really cared for Dr Scarpetti and her fictional family wanting to see her regain a little of her old self. This book jumps around and leaves us wondering what happened to not only Kay, but Marino and Lucy as well. I see Kay as someone who would not let Lucy hang in limbo and she would also get Marino back on track. I finished it only to see if I'd change my mind. My mother and sister agree with me. So hopefully the next one will show more intereaction between the main characters. Here's hoping."
1,"""...leaves this reader wishing money better spent""","Loved most of Cornwell's books since Body Farm....with the exception of Isle of Dogs, Hornet's Nest and Southern Cross...all below par.Predator is the worst Scarpetta one so far. All her characters are losing their identities as though some alien force is at work. Never liked Lucy anyway but now she's a robot. How far can Patricia Cornwell go before she reaches bottom? One more Scarpetta relapse and that'll do it!"
2,Predator is a mess,"Whew, I am glad I read the other reviews here, because I thought I was losing my mind - I am having a lot of trouble following the story in PREDATOR. Now I see it is not I who is confused. I am reading it in short bits, and I guess that's because I just don't like it enough to keep my attention on it. I am completely confused by Marino and Lucy - and didn't Benton die some books back? Nobody mentioned that, so now I am not sure. I am sorry I purchased this book. Now I feel I have to finish it to get my money's worth. If I had borrowed it, I would just return it to the library unfinished."
1,"That's it, I'm done","After her last book, I said I would give her one more chance to see if she could capture the magic that is Kay Scarpetta. She didn't. This book was awful. What makes it harder to take is in the comparsion with how good her books used to be. Oh well, I guess she ran her course. On to other authors."
1,Scenes from Hell,"I have read all the Kay Scarpetta mysteries and have given the others 5 stars. This I only give 1 as it was awful. I agree with the other critical reviews. The characters are more narcissistic and insensitive, the plot is choppy. Lucy continues with her attraction to psychopaths. Too much time is spent with the torture of the victims. It seems as though the book is an attempt at a depiction of hell without relief."
1,Past Expiration Date!,"I agree with the othere reviewers who feel that Patricia Cornwell is running on fumes.The recurring characters have grown stale and the plot this time did not make any sense. Kay Scarpetta, and the others seems to be stuck in a cyclle of depression and unhappiness. The characters are not moving forward and you grow quickly bored."
1,PREDATOR (KAY SCARPETTA MYSTERIES),"What a mess!! I have read all of the books in this series and this one is just sloppy and badly written. There are several story lines that just end, no conclusion or explanation. The old characters are all out of their minds or sick or both. I will be very careful before buying another Cornwell book."
1,What's Happened to Patricial Cornwell?,"Particia Cornwell's Scarpeta series has become increasingly twisted and boring. Her characters, once interesting and intriguing in their unique personalities, have become distant with each other and in fact at times seem to despise each other. They all seemed pathetic. The book didn't seem to have a plot, a poor beginning and an abrupt ending. I finished the book but I wonder why? It was a waste of time and money and I won't be buying anymore of Cornwell's books."
1,Absolutely ridiculous,Particia Cornwell has been on a steady decline for a while but this is the worst yet. I am unsure of where to begin but I can tell you that I felt (yet again) that she ran out of pages at the end and decided to wrap things up quickly to meet a deadline.What happened to her niece? What about Joe? Where did he go? What was his motivation?
2,Disappointed,"I have read just about all of the Kay Scarpetta series and I can say that this one cannot hold my attention. The characters personalities have completely changed, almost too drastic. I was extremely disappointed that I had to stop at about 150 pages into it."
1,No longer a Cornwell reader,This book was a real disappointment. All of the characters need intensive counseling/therapy. A real downer. I no longer find any of the characters sympathetic.
1,Forget it,This series has been going downhill for awhile. I kept hoping it would improve but I see that's not going to happen. I'll never read another.
1,What the @#x%?,"Well, I was a Cornwell fan. I finally put this book down for the last (of many) times. It wasn't ""couldn't put it down"" but rather, ""couldn't pick it up"". Total waste. There was so much jumping around, I had to refresh my memory on who's who and who's where every time I picked it up. A marathon race to a vague and inintelligible finish line. Whatever happened to Amos? The shotgun? What about the body paint? Or, was I so bored I missed those answers? Too many characters, not well developed (especially the bad guy, er girl, er...); Scarpetta was a non factor; Lucy has become a pathetic ankle weight to Scarpetta, while living in a fantasy world of cloak and dagger toys and lottery-like wealth; Marino is the stereotypical washed up, loveless, out of power cop; and on and on...Will the real Patricia Cornwell please stand up (and write again)?"
1,So disappointing,"I agree with most of the other 1 star ratings here:Why all of a sudden are these books being written in the third person?All the characters have morphed into new ones...Scarpetta isn't an intelligent woman, she's just a whiney shrew? Marino isn't overweight,scruffy and lovable, he's now a buff biker dude who loses his temper like a 5 year old little girl? Benton, back from the dead, is not a briliiant profiler, but now is part of some study where they MRI psychotics' brains? And Lucy has always been dark, but a genius. Now she's suddenly stupid?It used to be that I couldn't wait for a new Scarpetta novel. Trace, followed by this mess, has pretty much finished that.PC, PLEASE go back to your old style, return the characters to those who we love, and give us a story that's worthy of this crew!!!"
2,Not worth your time,The writer needs to take a long break before she comes back with another book. Mass production is hurting her work.
2,Time to give someone else a chance to shine,"Unfortunately, there is not much to recommend Predator. Characters that were once exciting are now one dimensional. It is a shame because Cornwall's earlier novels were full of insight, passion and finely crafted plots. I get the feeling that Cornwall is now going through the motions for the sake of a contract. It is sad because someone has written a really great mystery that the publishers didn't pick up because they had had this in the queue instead."
1,terrible,"Worst book I have read in a long time. Tried some Cornwell before and some early ones were OK, but this one is terrible. Far-fetched story line, and story jumps around too much. Ending is incomplete and leaves many loose ends, some of which are central to the story. I won't read Cornwell anymore."
1,Wondering,"I stopped buying Ms. Cornwell's books and am borrowing from our public library. The more recent works have so radically changed in point of view and voice, that I have wondered for several years if she is still doing the writing. She has obviously earned enough from her top notch early works to pay a ""ghost writer."" The style and plotting just don't seem consistent with her earlier books. The subject matter is too quasi-autobiographical, and readers are not responding to the psychological angst of the main characters as the major plot device. Perhaps she should lay her crime writing career to rest."
2,Tired of all of the regular character's temper tantrums!,"About 1/2 way through the book, I was so sick of Kay's temper tantrums, especially the one with Bentley for not telling her about a certain character's medical problem [obvious HIPAA violation if he did confide] that I just about closed the book. Marino always acts like a big fat red neck so I was used to his obnoxious behavior but everyone else began to act like he did. Joe the goofy path fellow was interesting for a while but the regulars should have caught on that he was poking his nose in places where it didn't belong. The book would have been much better if all of the all the back biting and temper tantrums were cut out of the book."
1,Simply Awful,"What mystery? What Forensics? Who are these characters? If Scarpetta headed any crime lab I would have serious doubts about their effectiveness. I don't buy her books to read about the angst in Scarpetta's relationships with friends and lovers. I keep hoping I will find an interesting and intriguing mystery. I am all done with Cornwell novels. I have never been so bored or lost in a story. I won't be back ....save your money and buy a real mystery writer ...Michael Connelly, James Lee Burke, etc."
2,Is Cornwell being contraire?,"Not only is this a bad read, Cornwell is misspelling words or making them up. Page 123 has Morino being contraire-does she mean contrary, which is what the context makes me believe that is what she meant. I will not waste any more money on Cornwells books, they are uninteresting, all the caracters are in a constant state of fugue. I thought I had had enough when she brought Benton back from the dead, it was so ridiculous, but, thinking she may have had a bad year and being an optimist, I bought another one-but it is my last."
3,"Scarpetta' Back!, (kind of)","I must admit that I haven't enjoyed the last three Scarpetta books, but I did enjoy this one. I found that it was a lot more tightly plotted than they've been of late, and Ms. Cornwell has described a pair of pretty heinous psychopaths. I still don't like Scarpetta told in the third person. I found with the earlier books when we heard her thoughts and actions in the first person, it was a lot more exciting, and it was easier to like her a bit more. I also don't enjoy Lucy. She's just too much to be believed and I think the books would be better without her presence. She's almost like a cartoon character- bigger than life, and just as unbelievable. I also felt that we didn't get enough of Marino in this book, and the glimpses we got were not positive glimpses. He is carrying around a lot of anger throughout the book. Anyway, this book is better than some of the previous, and the forensics are really good in this one which is just fine in my book."
2,Utterly Terrible,I hope in her next book she catches all the criminals because I feel like I was violated by buying this latest Scarpetta novel.Go back to the basics and give us a good meaningful story!!!!
1,Disappointed,"I have always liked the Scarpetta mysteries but, boy, was this one a dud. I never was able to get into the story and kept trying to figure out who everyone was and what part they played in the story."
1,AWFUL...JUST AWFUL,"(I would actually give this book 'no stars', but that is not an option.)Of one thing I am certain after reading this latest Kay Scarpetta novel: I will never waste my time on this sort of rubbish again. I have read several of Ms. Cornwell's, books, and even enjoyed the first two. Her characters, however, have become stale and unattrative. I just plain don't like them, nor do I care what happens to them in the plot. (Actually, I think it is time to REALLY kill off Benton and Lucy. Marino, I'm not sure, he may be salvagable. The characters' interrelationships are irrational and pooorly conceived. Also, Ms. Cornwell's most recent efforts are 'over the edge' in terms of the gruesome, fixation on the horrid details of the crimes portrayed. This book has set me free to pursue other more capable authors of this genre. (Like Michael Connelly, for example)"
2,not a good effort,"Any Cornwell work is better than some other books, but...I have NEVER liked the way Marino has been handled in the entire series - now he is like a caricature- before he was street wise liasion to Scarpetta, then he blew up to a large smoking drinking person who had health problems, and now he is aloof big muscle bound biker guy who is at odds with Scarpetta and knows something funny is going on with the misinformation -The series and this novel does not have the BITE it did - if you would reread the first books that made a wave in the thriller genre you will understand what I mean.We've gone through a lot with the regulars of this series - they have not progressed in the way the folks who pay hardback prices would like. Not so sure I will pay hardback prices again for this series again. and that's sad."
1,Trust the Reviews,"Amazon critics generally fall on the favorable side of the review curve, maybe because favorable ratings tend to get more positive responses. In this case (1.5 stars average) they are right on target. This is an appalling performance by a writer who used to know how to write believably, who used to know how to build suspense, and who used to know how to construct a plot. It all began to go downhill when ""Silence of the Lambs"" won all those Oscars and Cornwell decided she wanted a piece of the serial killer pie. The plots became increasingly outlandish, the characters became irritating, and the violence became nauseating. All these trends coalesce in ""Predator"" and Cornwell gives us the perfect storm of bad suspense fiction. I happened to check this out of the library a couple weeks after I read ""The Ruins"", which I thought was the worst suspense novel I ever read. Well, folks, we have a new contender."
2,More CSI please,"This is my first Scarpetta bookI got it as a giftAs someone who loves CSII feel like I've been stiffedI learned about the citrus blightAnd super fast road bikesShrinks and spiders, prison mailAnd food Scarpetta likesA killer's getting his brain scannedPeople are disappearingSomeone's out to ruin thingsBy boldly interferingThe plot is not believableIt can't be incidentalThat all the major charactersHave gone completely mentalIt's not a thrilling, easy readIt hops about like madIt's not the worst I've ever readBut still, it's pretty badAmanda Richards, February 23, 2007"
1,my mistake,"i should have read the Amazon reviews first. the book was terrible with 6-8 plots,sort of, that never came together. looks like Cornwell is generating cash based on past- too bad!"
1,Could be my last Scarpetta ever!,"I agree with most of the reviews. The 3rd person narrative is annyoying, confusing and unreadable. Her once beloved characters have become annoying. What happened to Marino? I cringed every time I turned the page and saw that he was in a scene. I have read the whole series through twice and still can't figure out what happened to Lucy. Benton is a shell of his former interesting self. I have struggled through the last 3 books now and have finally given up. Maybe if the next one gets decent reviews I'll try it, but I'm thinking no! Try the Lisa Gardner Rainie Connor/Pierce Quincy series if you're looking for something similar and fresh."
1,No Satisfaction,"I really looked forward to seeing how these characters had progressed and it seems none have. That and the story being tedious, confusing and very unsatisfying has left me to wonder what has happened to one of my favorite authors. The characters and plot were all over the place. Maybe it's time to put the characters, at least, to rest. There's no life to any of them."
1,the worst of them all,"Huge disappointment. Trace wasn't that good either. Having read all Scarpetta's previous storiesbut I was hoping Trace would be only bad one. However, the downhill trend seems to continue. These two books are not the usual intelligent plots Cornwell is capable of writing. Save your money, don't buy it. I completely agree with all the reviews posted so far, so I won't go into the plot -or rather lack of a real plot -details."
1,WHAT HAPPENED TO PAT?,I've been in love with Patricia Cornwells' characters for many years and I don't understand what she's done with them. All of a sudden they are paranoid and nitpicky and backstabbing. I'll stick with the previous years. Very disappointing.
2,What the heck?,I'm about halfway through this book and have been wondering if it's just me or is this book not very good? I see now by the reviews here that it's not just me. This will likely be my last Cornwell Scarpetta mystery.
2,Predator,"I always wait eagerly for the next Kay Scarpetta novel to be released. After PREDATOR, I'm not so sure I care if Scarpetta ever shows her face on the bookshelves again. In spite of their flaws and quirkiness the main characters have always been at least likable human beings. In PREDATOR they were flat and one-dimensional,leaving this reader not caring whether they live or not. Come on, Cornwell, your early Scarpetta books were spectacular. Your faithful fans deserve better than PREDATOR."
1,Last Precinct is the Last good novel,"Kay Scarpetta's last good adventure was ""The Last Precinct"".Bringing Benton back........... BIG MISTAKE, reminded me of how they brought back Bobby on ""Dallas"".Worse, when it was written in first person, She WAS the character.The whole series has ground to a halt. From Body Farm to Last Precinct, it's a GREAT Series........ since then, a waste of time"
1,Were there pages missing?,"I have read all these books and for the first time in my life, I actually looked at the page numbers to see if some were missing!!I wasted a lot of time and money reading this book. I know nothing about these characters that I didn't know before. I don't understand the plot (I don't think there was one). I don't know how it ends..it simply didn't. What an absolute disappointment."
1,Taking this to the used bookstore - hopefully they'll take it,"I wish I didn't have to give a star at all!This book was truely awful. The Last Precint was also the last book she wrote that was decent.The story was disjointed and the conclusions that it came to made no sense to the rest of the story.I think that Ms. Cornwell should go back and read some of her previous books to see why everyone is hugely disappointed with Blow Fly, Trace and now Predator. As much as I hate to admit it, I'm done with the Scarpetta series.I think I'll just continue my move to Kathy Reichs and Linda Fairstein."
1,Don't bother.,"The last three books, in my opinion have not been worth the time I spent with them. I hope she can capture her old writing style with the next one. I enjoyed all of the others."
1,Who really wrote this book???,"Okay - if Patricia Cornwell wrote ""Predator"", then who authored the first three truly great reads: ""Cruel & Unusual"" ""Body of Evidence"" and ""All That Remains""???? Where did the good stuff go? I don't get it - great characters like Kay Scarpetta, Pete Marino, even Benton and Lucy - they have all been reduced to bickering, boring people. How about the plot - is there one? It didn't end like a cliffhanger, yet it was not finished. I am sad to say that if there is a sequel, I don't really care. There was a time when the upcoming release of a Patrica Cornwell novel was something to note on my calendar. That time has obviously passed."
2,Disjointed and disappointing.,"I agree with so many of the posts that the third-person narrative is not an addition to this series. A great deal of the strength of the earlier novels was Scarpetta's first-person narration. It is now lost in favor of a story that is told by no-one, and so has no particular voice or perspective. The plot is disjointed and the main characters spend far too little time interacting with one another. Cornwell's last few novels have asked us to believe in coincidences. More far-fetched, though, they've asked us to believe that Scarpetta et al are some sort of national celebrities, and that everyone knows who they are. Many of the crimes committed in the most recent novels are committed solely to get the attention of one of the main characters. Please, Ms. Cornwell, let Scarpetta tell her own tales, and return her to solving cases that have nothing to do with her."
2,I waited months for this????,"How am I disappointed?......Let me count the ways!!!! First, Kay Scarpetta has been turned into a robot in a skirt! She has become a cold unfeeling person except where Lucy is concerned. I am not sure that she was that upset about Lucy's secret except that she hadn't been in on it from the get-go. If I was Benton or Marino I would tell her to go take a ""flying leap"". When I went from chapter 63 to 64 I was sure I must have skipped a chapter or two. I hope she stays happy with her ""job"" 24/7 because at the end of the day thats all she will have. If Patricia Cornwell is tired of Kay Scarpetta then she should give her up instead of making her loyal readers despise what Kay has turned into, a self-absorbed, workalcholic who has no need for anyone. SAD!!"
1,Made me sad,"It just didn't seem like it was written by the same author. I think the 3rd person point of view that the series has now taken the mystery out of the story all together. Every character I have come to like for example Marino and Benton, were now portrayed as entirely miserable people with no hope. ALL protagonist characters were portrayed in a negative light from chapter to chapter showing nothing but human weakness. That's usually ok for a book but, those portrayals of the protagonists are usually backed up by their strengths in the end.I hope if there is another one, it will revert back to style of the Body Farm and Potters Field."
1,how many trees died to publish this book?,"Absolutely horrible. Cornwell wallows in the violence of her sociopathic characters and makes the ""good guys"" more and more unlikeable. I keep expecting the misogynistic Marino to go postal and start committing serial murders on his own....Maybe that's Cornwell's next plot line. Scarpetta is cold as ice, Benton is too wrapped up in his ego to see through his evil ""pet"" patient. Lucy falls for a lesbian serial killer. All in all, just another atrocious waste of time. Turn the lights out when you leave folks, I'm outta here!"
1,Predator,I was an avid Cornwell reader and collected her hardcovers however the past couple of tears I've been disappointed more often than not so I opted for the paperback. I found the storyline confusing and characters left hanging. Perhaps because I lost interest I'm still not certain who the killer is. As the pages ran out I had more questions than I did midway through. Very dissapointing.
2,Not her best work,I love Ms Cornwell's work but this left me wanting more. It was still a good read but not her best.
2,Patricia Cornwell tries to copy Dan Brown,"I was somewhat disappointed in the lastest installment of Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series ... mainly because there wasn't enough Scarpetta in the story.Cornwell takes on a Dan Brown-like pacing -- short chapters, jumping from plot line to plot line -- that doesn't suit the complex character that is Scarpetta. We've grown to love her work at the crime scene, at the autopsy table and in the kitchen. The interesting explanations of procedure and attention to detail that mark Cornwell's best work are missing from ""Predator.""While the book proved an entertaining read, it just wasn't very special. I'd hate to think that Kay Scarpetta is doddering toward old age."
1,terrible,"the worst book she has written in the scarpetta series,what has happen,better start over..a long time fan"
5,Sublime,"Meditation in song. One of the must beautiful recordings I have ever heard. This woman's voice can take you to the most luminous places of your heart. A work of love, undoubtedly, and it shows."
2,Burnt rice sticks to the bottom,"A thick layer of burnt rice sticks to the bottom if the cooker is on heat mode for even a minute, ie we have to stand around and turn it off the moment it is done cooking.Steam escapes from the vent, often starch water escapes as well and the counter gets messy, even when cooking only 1 or 2 cups of rice.The plastic spoon is not of very high quality and melted!"
2,Messy and often burns rice,"I've had this for a year, and I am quite unsatisfied with this rice cooker.The rice cooker will begin to brown and burn the rice on the bottom if I do not unplug it right after it's done cooking. One of my friends has the exact same cooker and says she has the same problem.Also, the rice cooker tends to boil over and spew starch-water all over the cooker and the surrounding area on the table."
4,glass hummingbird feeder 10 oz,"I love the concept of this hummingbird feeder. I purchased it to keep the other birds from spilling all of the food. I haven't seen as many hummingbirds feeding as I used to and I'm not sure if it is the time of the year or if they have a more difficult time getting the food....so I am giving it a ""I like it"" rating hoping I will see my quantity of birds return to the feeder. At that time I would change my rating to ""to I love it""."
3,Not As Pictured,"The feeder I received is not egg-shaped as in the picture, but is more of afloral design, with indentation lines running vertically. It is also clearglass, not red (the red is presumably hummingbird food, which really shouldbe clear -- tiny birds don't need food coloring, nor does any other living thing).The bottom piece of red plastic is as pictured.I would have preferred the egg shape, it is less fussy looking, but thebirds don't mind."
2,Not the exact same product as featured.,"While I have the original Garden Song feeder, one of my feeders broke(due to me dropping it) therefore ordered a replacement which looks like the same online but once I received it, the glass part is not smooth and round like the originals or as shown in the picture so it doesn't match the others.Will probably still use it but not pleased that it doesn't match."
1,Didn't receive what I ordered!!!!!,You didn't send me anything like what the picture shows. You sent me 2 silly generic looking plastic humming bird feeders and I think I ordered 5 of the glass Garden Jewels 447-12 10 oz. Hummingbird Feeders because they are beautiful and different. I am very disappointed. These are a present for my husband and father for Father's Day and I haven't given them to them yet. They won't know all of this drama but I do and I am so unhappy.
4,Enjoying my Lens,I am a beginner and trying to take pictures with Macro. I got some amazing pictures. Have not tried everything trick but so far liking it.
5,good lens,"Takes excellent photos. Good for the price. I needed a telephoto lens for wildlife picture and this one has fit the bill so far. Have some good pics of quail and deer, i also am looking forward to a trip to Yellowstone it test it out fully."
3,A surprisingly good lens for the price.,"Every Nikon owner knows the best lenses are made by Nikon, but it isn't always possible to spend over a thousand dollars for one. This 70-300mm lens by Sigma hits a nice price point for a fairly decent lens. I've used it in many different situations - full daylight, concerts at night - and it performs well. At full zoom, you can turn your mediocre seating into front row images, but make sure you have a steady hand. You will get camera shake at full zoom in low light situations unless you're perfectly still.The macro on this lens is shockingly good. It only works at 200-300mm, which means you have to be a few feet away to use it, but images tend to be very crisp. You'll want to pair the lens with a decent flash, however, if you aren't in full sun.This Sigma isn't as crisp and pure as a true Nikon lens, but it's a great alternative for the amateur and/or hobbyist."
4,Nice Lens,Most of us can't afford the L series type lenses. This lens is not bad for the price and it comes with a hood. The Macro mode is great and so far I can't complain about the photos I have taken with it. I really haven't pushed this lens but I will in the next month or so as I build up my portfolio. Nice bang for the buck try it and see.
4,"So far, so good",I'm a beginner amateur photographer and just bought this lens. I has done very well with some of the test shots I have taken so far. I will be going to the beach in the near future and look forward to seeing what I can do with it.
3,Anyone with Samsung Nx 100,"You need aRainbowImaging Pentax & Samung PK / K mount lens to Samsung NX10 NX-10 Camera Mount Adapter, replaces Samsung Adapter MA9NXK. MSRP USD55.99to make this fit."
3,Good but there are some issues,"Its a good lens for the price. Also works great for the amount of range it has. However, if you are taking pictures of subjects that are close, then the image will not be sharp (very frequently). Also the lack of image stabilizer feature is a down side. You may not get sharp pictures quite occasionally."
5,Great Lens to start out with! Amazing result to end with!,"Recently got it in the mail and once I start using it, it seems to very sturdy, and it can stand up to harsh condition. This lens is great for macro because of the built in macro switch. Very easy to use. Portrait turned out amazing with this too. Overall, great deal and great lens, and Sigma lens are well made."
5,does this fit the 550d canon dslr,does this fit the 550d canon dslr-im looking for a big lens like this but not sure if it works with my camera
4,Hip Hop Dance instructional DVD - pretty good!,"I borrowed this from the library and watched it from beginning to end the first time then tried to do some of the moves. It is a hip hop dance instructional aid. The instructor shows and counts the moves and/or steps one time, then does it with 2 other people, then a bit faster with music, then turns around so you see it from the back (which is really a good thing for dance moves) then adds to it. If I do it often enough I might just get it but right now it is new to me and I don't pick up dance steps that easily. Each one of the counts is a move of the body and when it all comes together it looks really cool. It was FUN!"
3,This is good,"Ok, so I'm new to the Violent Femmes. I heard ""Blister in the Sun"" and loved it. So, when I heard they had a new album out, of course I bought it. It's pretty good, although it falters a bit towards the middle and end of the album, the first few songs are really catchy."
3,femmes marketing,"This is the femmes grown older but trying to keep up with the younger guys. Even the CD cover is cartoonish. Actually, I guess this trend started with the ""Machine"" CD. I haven't listened to ""Freak Magnet"" for a long time but I do remember the beginning (the ""A"" side) as being mostly strong and then come quite a few average songs with a good one here and there. If you're a femmes' fan, you'll want it out of curiosity and for a few femmes' classics. However, they don't seem to be a band with a message or a mission anymore. They're just jamming femmes style."
4,talented musicians,"This is a response to a review 5 or so earlier... quote ""VIOLENT FEMMES is a band most have not heard of, but should. Okay, so musically they're not really talented.""I'm sorry, this guy dont know jack-s**t. The guys are incredibly talented. Brian Richie on accoustic bass blows all & sundry away on his bass both on the studio albums and particularly live. He is a master bass player really like no other. Not a stretch to say he's the Jimi Hendrix of Bass. He's simply brilliant.He's developed a style of playing bass like a lead guiter. Lead guitar breaks, but on Bass. Then he has figured out a way to play all 4 strings and create rythym chords on the bass too.An incredible fused bass sound unheard of.Gordon Gano is equally nearly adept on guitar (when he chooses to be) and has a unique and great sounding voice.now i'm not sure what the playing is like on this album as i have never heard it, but just listen to thier first 2 albums and you'll see what i mean"
2,Disappointment,This DVD looks like it was made in the 60's. A real turn off to make any of the items. Disappointed in the DVD.
3,Read your code,"I gave up reading after only 20% of this book. I had hoped it would give encouragement and easy-to-read pointers on how to quickly familiarize oneself with a large body of code. Instead, I found it to be reverse-engineering explanations of statements and structures that would better be learned from a reference manual. The code-reading exercises might be valuable, but I'd say that if you really want to practice code reading, start with real code from your company's codebase. Still, Spinellis has made a fair first attempt at writing about an activity that should be done a lot more often. I look forward to better offerings on this topic in the future."
1,Piece of Junk,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. You'd be better off buying a good book on C programming. You can get all the source code provided on the CDROM on the internet. There are code fragments, incomplete, which the author uses to explain the concept of C programming.Just a rip off!!! The sample chapter on aw is the only worth reading. Go search for other resources. Save your $ for some other good book."
2,Only for fans,"2 1/2More like a fan ep then one for the casual listener, this dubious short length nonetheless can still introduce those irresistable qualities prevelent in this songwriter's quirky depression. Featuring two editions of their catchy, but rockin as hell ""happy man"" only proceed if you have checked out other full lenghts of the fractured pop rock."
1,"Can you hear me, mother?","Ms. Browne may find that her supernatural mumbo jumbo offers adivce and comfort to those of us recently bereaved but she couldn't tell me where my grandmother hid her bingo winnings, could she. Oh no. And I bought this before you reduced it. No one from the ""other side"" could think to tell her you were going to cut the price, could they. And my dead grandad is called Frank, not Alan, like she tries to claim."
2,Disappointment.,"The cushion is not even as thick as the picture implies. I am a very light person at 120 lbs and it still flattened out too quickly. I have to use an extra cushion to even be comfortable, and so I am left with wondering if this product is even helping me."
1,Don't waste your money !,I had been wanting this for 2 years due to having a cracked tail bone several times in my life. When I saw it at this price I bought it right away. I'm here to tell you not to waste your money! I only weigh 100 pounds which is small for an adult and when I sat on this hoping it would keep my tail bone lifted the pillow completely smashed down flat with no support what so ever. It was a BIG disappointment.
1,Flat!,"This cushion is very disappointing. In less than a week, it has gone completely flat and the seams have separated. I am not a large person either! It doesn't even puff back up when I don't use it. Don't buy it; it does not do anything it is advertised for."
1,Flat on delivery,"Bought this for my wheelchair-bound husband. This cushion is flat, not affording adequate support. The velour cover is a magnet for dust, hair, etc. Not worth the money."
2,flat as a pancake!,"this orthroWedge cushion starts off with good support,but after a week it looses its support and stays flat like a pancake! so, if you need it for a week only then buy it but if you need it for a month try something else,like your pillow. it will probably give u more support!"
3,Good Support,"This pillow, bought to boost me a couple of inches since I'm so short, works quite well. It is comfortable and does provide a couple of extra inches; however, there is one flaw. It is a bit slick on the bottom so it slides around on the leather seat which is just a bit annoying."
1,Worst item for the problem I have ever seen!,"Purchased this item hoping it would give support when sitting.It doesn't even feel like there is any thing in the chair. In my opinion, spend your money on something that will help the problem,like supporting you when you are sitting. One of the worst products I have ever purchased for a specific problem."
2,Cushion doesn't hold shape or offer enough support,I have a couple of different brands of these - the Wagan Ortho Wedge Cushion has poor quality foam that flattens out the first time you use it and doesn't provide sufficient support. Spring for one of the memory foam options instead.
2,Doesn't make a difference,"The material is cheap velvet, so I will slowly slide down it ocasionally. It also does not really feel different than sitting in a chair. :/"
2,Ortho Wedge,"To support the posture you need to sit on something firm.I did not find this item hepful for me. Even though if fit well at Toyota Corolla.That's why I decided to return this item and bought another one (more firm)at ""Bath and Beyond""(advertized on TV). Much better quality."
2,Not impressed.,"I've got a deviating tailbone & thought I'd give this a shot. Put this in my office chair. It feels good, looks nice etc.. but after a day or 2 it just flattens out. Probably not the highest quality foam, but I wasn't expecting miracles at $12 + shipping. Don't know if I'll try another...I may just put this in the car."
2,"Small, Not a Tent, and Falls Over Too Much","I read the reviews, but thought it looked cool anyway, so I bought it. I shouldn't have. I should have listened to the reviews. It came very wrinkled in the box and because of the wrinkles, the tunnels do not stand straight when put together. It also collapses very easily and is very short (my 3 year old is too tall for it and 75% of 3 year olds are taller than he is). The flags fall out easily, too. My 3 year old says he likes it, but he never plays with it other than to kick it down to get past it to the toys behind it."
4,German punk!,"Die Toten Hosen (The Dead Trousers) are a German punk band. This CD here is their ""covers"" album. It features their cover versions of some of their favorite punk songs. The cool thing about it is that all the songs feature one of the original recording artists guest-starring on them. The songs are well performed and fun. I would recommend this album to fans of old school punk."
3,Relaxing bit of jazzy pop!,"While not possessing a monster like ""Keep on Movin'"", the hit that brought Jazzy B and his group international recognition, this album is a decent effort, featuring great vocals from Caron Wheeler (""Take Me Higher""), Richie Stephens (""Joy""), Rick Clarke (""Just Right""), and Kofi (""Move Me No Mountain"" and ""Future""). Fine flute work by Gary Barnacle highlights both ""Storm"" and ""Intelligence""."
4,Roll Tide!,"I am not a fan of Alabama, I do however understand the fervent fan world. Living in Columbus, Ohio, you can almost not avoid the intense Ohio State Buckeye support.I found Rammer Jammer a fun book to read. The fans depicted by St. John were both endearing and understandable in their manis to support 'Bama. I like that St. John did not come into their world as an absolute outside, he was already an ardent Alabama fan. To have done this otherwise would have come off as condesending and mocking at the expense of his subjects. I would recommend this as a good read for family members of those crazed fans of any sports team. It may help to shine a light on the mania of your loved one who devotes so much time and energy to their team."
4,Fun mythical romp.,"Lillith is a beautiful story that, as a good fairy tale should, draws the tragic and exultant in a heightening crescendo. The story is an enjoyable journey through an imaginative and enchanting allegory of love, forgiveness and redemption. The imagery is heavy enough that it is often hard to figure out just what everything represents or if someone or something represents anything at all. The narrator, Mr. Vane (one wonders if MacDonald was playing off the homophone with vain or not), can be hard to accept at times but, as MacDonald no doubt intended, we see enough of our foolish selves in him to understand the tragedy and triumph of his part in the tale. My one complaint might be the ambiguity of the ending. It is too much at odds with all that is accomplished through the narrative to that point. Additionally, MacDonald's fairy tales help one to understand the sources for much of CS Lewis's work, both in the themes and styles employed."
5,Where the boots hit the ground,A detailed and thorough study of Mujahadeen tactics as they developed in the Soviet-Afghan war. A must read for anyone wishing to learn more about this troubled country and the warrior spirit that forged inovative responses to Soviet technology and tactics. This may be the definitive work in the west on the topic of guerrilla tactics in Afghanistan.
4,Surprisingly good,"I bought this for a laugh, as I enjoyed the Levi's commercials that features the Flat Eric puppet. However, the music is really good - it's mostly minimalist electronic beats, and it managed to stray outside the perfect rhythm most electronica falls into.The music isn't as dramatic or elaborate as, say, the Chemical Brothers (not neccessarily a bad thing), but it manages to carry a fun mood with a minimum of instrumentation. The songs seem to bear replaying well, too, which is uncommon for this style of music."
3,Nice 1960's mystery adventure,"Got a glimpse of this nice Australian-made action adventure today and liked it very much. It is typical of the actioners made during this period and that's not bad. Done in color it has South African authentic backdrops and very good underwater sequences. Dale Robertson, popular American TV star of the time, and veteran British actor Richard Todd head an able cast for a delightful diversion for the old fashion type escape drama."
3,Difficult Summary,"Hornung takes a fascinating topic and renders it fairly dry and academic, but that's probably his purpose here. Unfortunately, everything is touched on only sketchily, so that you only get tantalizing hints without any real depth.I will likely have to get a second resource now since this was too general for my purposes. It was, however, wonderfully illustrated, and is probably a great 'quick guide' if you need some information fast."
2,Unhappy hummingbirds,"I purchased this feeder in the winter. I thought it was a nice design and a good choice for my collection of feeders. Since putting it out, the hummingbirds just aren't real thrilled with it. I'm refilling the other feeders every other day and this one I have to dump out the water because it has gone stale. I can't put a finger on it, what they don't like about it. I have to shake it lightly to get the air bubbles out of the base. I've noticed that they have to lean over and down to reach the flower. I don't know if this is an uncomfortable position for them or if it has anything to do with why they don't come to this one and fight over the others. I still have hope that it will become one of their favorites, but at this point have my doubts."
3,A Good Classic.,"You have to appreciate Sci-Fi of the period to appreciate this movie. I do, and I enjoy it.It is not among the best (very unsophisticated) but it is good watching. However, if you are not into this gene, you will probably find it dull. Since the premises are silly and the special effects are poor compared to today's standards.It is simply a good classic movie, to be appreciated as such."
3,A bit slow at first but an entertaining rocket ride to the moon of a movie,"The thing that I liked about this movie was that it was loyal to the original H.G. Wells story. the problem was that it is a fantastic tale of fantasy and has no basis in fact. Yes, it is a science-fiction/fantasy tale set in Victorian times with a connection made to modern times. You will notice that it looks and feels silly through most of the film. It is an uneasy combination that is not as good as H. G. Well's other space adventure, WAR OF THE WORLDS. Ray Harryhausen's Dynarama effects steal the show. Overall, it is good but not great."
4,Just like I remembered it.... FUNNY!,"Great supplier, quality is superb and delivery quick. DVD is funny, just how i remembered it - except i forgot about the era.... Highly reommended!"
1,Terrible beyond comprehension,British jingoism. Historically inaccurate to Wells and to everything else. Terrible acting and laugable script adaptation.One of the worst films I have ever seen.
3,Reggie's Review,"I have always loved these old Harry Haussen movies. As soon as I can purchase all, I will.If you are a fan, the price for these movies are worth it!"
3,An easy going scifi classic with the H.G. Wells feel.,"I, like many others was brought up on films like this and this IS one of my favourites. Another review says it is British jingoism, is american jingoism the only type allowed? The space craft sphere is just so Victorian and 'HGWellsian' that it creates a believabilty in the possibility of it really happening. This innocence is also portrayed in the Wallace and Gromit story ""A Day Out"". Sure, it has holes but that's not important. It's genuinely classic, romantic,poignant and telling."
3,One Big Flaw,"A collection of excellent short essays on various topics in Russian history. If that were all it was, I couldn't complain. The book comes with a CD containing lectures on similar topics, but not readings of the essays themselves. Why not? The most helpful thing for an auto didact would be both a text and matching audio. Maybe the author just doesn't care about self learners and is only trying to reach an audience of university students. Too bad, in my opinion. This could have been among my all time favorites."
4,Phillies Memories,"For a die hard Phillies fan this should be called Phillies nightmares as it brings back all the heartache of following this team. They dwell way too much on the 1993 team which lost in the world series while glossing over the 50 and 60's . I assume this is due to lack of film. It is nice to see some of the heroes you grew up with being interviewed. All in all alot is stuff that you've seen hundred of times, but it is a nice 2 hours of memories."
1,Lousy Product,"The seat ""beads"" collapsed.I have nothing against the vendor, as the transaction went well, but the product, oy!"
4,Great for doing Eastern massage modalities.,"I have really enjoyed this whole series. The intensity and focus are just right for doing Eastern styles of massage like Shiatsu. I did like the second one a bit more than the third, though."
5,Excellent book for starters,"This book is really good for people who are thinking of getting into networking areas. The labs are very well detailed and self explanitory! When I had questions that was not answered in the book, the author offers a FREE tech support website. I had an answer within 24 hours. I am looking forward to seeing other books of Mr. Dave Prowse in the near future. This book is a must have reference for any novice or entry level technician."
4,it grew on me,"My initial reaction to this book was that it was probably fine for denizens of Oprah's bookworld, but not for me. I was wrong. Or maybe I should reassess my vision of Oprah. In any case, in its early going, I thought the author was trying too hard to tell an achingly beautiful story. The village was too perfectly imperfect, and its characters were too vividly memorable. The author's rhythm of moving from one character to another in each chapter eventually took hold of me, and I was interested in finishing this long and interesting book. Most importantly for me, I realized how little I knew about life in the Ottoman empire, and the book brought many things home to me. I always had found the near east to be a muddle; it is much less so now--especially some of the relationships between its various peoples: Greeks, Turks, Armenians, Kurds, Italians, etc. The author seems to be influenced by Tolstoy's War and Peace. He's not that good, but he's not bad. It's worth reading."
1,I actually wouldn't give it any stars,Just plain didn't like it. Had trouble from page 1 getting into it and never finished it.
2,Coke Tag,This is like a low quality replica of the painted Coca-Cola tag.The vinyl coke sticker discolored quickly.Not sure if it was from bug splats or or what.This has only been on the car less than two months.10/10/2011This is a follow up.After about three months on the car this POS item has turned from a light red color to a pink with yellow spots.Picture here [....]Do not waste your money on this item. It was not due to bug splats.This is just a poor quality item.
2,Needs some work,"Very nice looking feeder. It is just poorly made/designed. You need to take off the suction cup section to mount to the window, then attach the feeder part to that. I couldn't get them apart. Without doing this, you can't get the suction cups to adhere to the window enough to prevent it falling off. Look at other reviews about how to dremmel part of the suction cup section away to get around this. Eventually this works well, just not as shipped."
2,does not work,"Only buy this if you dont want to stick it onto a window with the suction cups. the plastic piece that holds the cups in place prevent the cups from gaining full contact with the glass, so I was unable to stick it to my window!! That said, I can still use it by just setting it on a shelf on my balcony. It works fine this way and the birds still come to drink. I am satisfied with that, but do not buy this if you really want to use it as it is described ""suction cupped to window"" The design does not allow this type of attachment."
2,Glass hummingbird feeded,"I would not recommend this product. Much to heavy for the windows! With the cost of postage and the product itself, it is over-priced and I would not repeat the order. I finally replaced the suction cups with larger ones, it would still not stay on the glass window after many tries."
2,Glass Hummingbird Feeder,"I really did not realize how heavy this feeder was until it arrived. No matter what I do to clean the glass surface and the suction cups, the feeder falls off of the window. It is just too heavy or the cups do not provide enough suction to hold it. Every time it falls, the glass chips off the bottom."
1,What a great idea - what a bad design.....,I was so looking forward to this and as the suction cups let go and I watched this glass fall to the slate patio all I could think of was - I hope I can get all the sherds of glass. Thank goodness it did not break.Very disapointed in the product. If they used palstic not glass this may hve worked.
2,Poor Design,"I've had this item about 1 month. The feeder is very sturdy & the humming birds come right to it. The big problem is the suction cups. There is a plastic piece that surrounds the suction cups, so it is impossible for the suction cups to be flat against the window. This causes the feeder to constantly slide off the window, especially when it rains. If I could get ride of that plastic piece, it would be perfect."
1,Worst I ever had.,I have had window feeders for years and have enjoyed them very much. I have to say I read the directions many times and tried many ways for this feeder to work and can't make it work. Complete waste of money and time trying to get it to work.
1,Didn't last but about 1hour.Then it fell and broke one of the plastic ridges off.,I didn't care for it.The glass made it to heavy it lasted about one hour.Then fell and broke.Wouldn't waste my money again.
3,window feeder,"We have several feeders. The birds love this feeder, but it is difficult to remove from the bracket that holds it in place. Also, since it has a small opening at the top, it is difficult to clean."
2,Garden song 455-3,This is a good looking feeder unfortunate the container is glass and is heavy. I filled it stuck it on a window it seemed secure but when I closed the window it slid to the bottom pooped off and shattered on my deck. I would like to find another container and try again.
2,Did not hold up,"We have had this for a couple of years, it was not stable and now has basically fallen apart and become unusable. A lot of the larger shoes did not fit."
4,Great Quiet Game for Energetic Kids!,Finally - a quiet and soft toy for my boys to play with! Super easy set up and doesn't fall over easily. Good for hand-eye coordination and throwing skills. My boys like it - and the soft bean-bags won't destroy anything.
4,"Beautiful, but not a coffee table book---very helpful","As a cooking student, this book is helpful, not too fluffy with photos. It explains the care and feeding of dough starters, and how to make crusty breads at home (different than in a commercial kitchen a little). There are great non-bread recipes for salads, brunch items,soups, gnocchi, biscotti. Haven't tried many of them yet but so far, so good, money well spent, and I'm sure it will inspire recipes for my workplace."
1,Business Book,Way too technical and not reader friendly. This book needs to use more laymens terms when specifying how to utilize my business.
5,Doom Pussy is a haunting account of unarmed flight,"""I have flown into the jaws of the cat of death,"" is the English translation of a Vietnamese proverb, which applied to flying at night. American aviators simply said, I have seen the Doom Pussy. This story would be good fiction; as it is--true--it is electrifying.That, plus the story of the snake, the guard and spending Monopoly money on the local economy are enough for me to recommend this to anyone.One last pathos: combining Ed Atterberry's plane being shot down with Browning's poen ""...Ghent to Aix"" works beautifully. Plus we learn how even respected and veteran reporters published false information about the torture or lack of torture of Americans in the Hanoi Hilton...well, I got bleary eyed.Read this. You'll laugh more than you cry, but you'll do both."
2,Not as it should be,"First: I still like the smell!Second: I agree with the other 1-2 star reviewers, that it is hard to believe that this is an original.I used the perfume years ago and it really lasted the whole day, ""delivering"" compliments not only from my wife;-). As it is really expensive, I stopped using it for some years. Now, being in the US, I searched for it again and gave it a try, as I couldn't imagine to get a ""fake"". But most likely I was wrong.So be careful and try to get and original GIT in a perfumery, where you can test it for one day;-)Again it used to be a fantastic smell!!!"
3,Not for beginners,"First off, this book is really not for beginners. It does do a good job of explaining grammar, however, if one is not already familiar with the language, it can tend to be a bit over one's head (as in my case). This was the first book that I found and purchased on the Finnish language around a year and a half ago, and I still have not found it entirely useful because I am not ready for it yet. I am sure it would be more useful as I get better, but this one is probably not for beginners."
3,ok,I just saw this movie not that long ago and it was ok. For Robin Tunny well after seeing her in The Craft I would think she can do better then that.
1,simplistic thief of your time and money,"Remember reading Shirley Jackson in high school?Remember reading and Carson McCuller's or watching a movie adaption of her work?Hold these in your mind.Now take away insight, originality, psychological resonance, and acting ability and you have Julian Po."
4,Unknown Treasure,"I think this is the best role I've seen for Tim Curray. The Rocky Horror Picture Show was excellent, but it effectively ruined his career. He's had many roles since, but none as convincing as this.Tatum O'Neal was amazing. My two images of her are the little girl in Paper Moon and as an adult in this movie.The movie is not fast-paced. Rather, it gives you an opportunity to absorb the time period and the mind set of people at that time.This is a movie for people who want to connect, emotionally, with the characters in a non-artificial way. I believe we saw some real acting in this movie, minus the typical hollywood glitz. Emotions weren't jerked out of you, the just come out naturally. There's not a character in this movie that someone can't identify with.Tatum, you did an excellent job."
4,Classic Comedy,"Clancy Street Boys has a tried but true storyline in a b-picture format. Muggs (Leo Gorcey) is having a birthday, and just like every year, his rich uncle (Noah Beery) sends him money through the mail. In the card is an announcemnt; Uncle is coming to New York with his daughter (Amelita Ward) to visit. Muggs' mother (Martha Wentworth) becomes distressed. It seems that her husband has been scamming Muggs' uncle for years, telling him that there are seven children, not one, for the extra birthday cash. In order to protect his father's honor, Muggs rounds up the gang to play the parts, including Glimpy (Huntz Hall) as his little sister Annabelle.The story is very funny and well done. The gang's slang really makes for some great jokes, and as always Gorcey and Hall shine. Gorcey is able to bring plenty of laughs by being completely serious, and Hall's goofyness is inevitably funny."
5,"""People of Earth""","Great 1950s Sci-fi with Hugh Marlowe.The special effects are nothing special, but it was 1956 !Very enjoyable movie I can watch over and over !"
1,unhappy,I was unhappy with the item because.1.It wouldn't play on my DVD player or my computer.2. the warning that it has to be for a certain region needs to be put up front.3. when you have to send an item back because it doesn't work it cost the consumer. its like a penalty .
1,What about the little box on the screen?????????????,"I'm sorry, but has NO ONE noticed that you cannot play this movie without that stupid little box on the upper right hand corner of the screen, that won't go away??? On my copy the menu only lets you play the movie with the ""Chromachoice"" option, which allows you to play the movie in either color or black and white....but with EITHER OPTION there is still that damn blue box in the upper corner of the screen that lets you ""toggle"" back and forth between versions. I cannot get rid of it, and I've tried every button on my DVD player and remote. I don't want to stare at that blankety-blank box while I'm trying to enjoy this fantastic movie. Am I doing something wrong here, or do I have a defective copy? I love this film, but if you can't watch it without that box then this product is a complete and total ripoff.Help!!"
5,Great Classic Sci-Fi Movie,"For a 1956 movie, you can't get much better than this classic sic-fi movie! Special effects by Ray Harryhausen are great! This classic stands the test of time!"
3,Hilarious and ridiculous paranoia,"From the opening scenes of the doofus Air Force fighter pilot to the ditzy airline stewardess dropping the passengers food; you're in for a real treat of 1950's science fiction. Woooooooooo! Just listening to the opening commentary will have you on the floor. Wooooooo! The dramatic ""flying saucer music"" will make you so tense, you'll pass gas in fear. Wooooooo!Sit back and enjoy some terrible acting and really stupid-looking aliens. Woooooooooo! UFO's ! The Aliens have landed! Run for your freakin' 1950's lives. Woooooooo! Flying Dinner Plates! You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss $14 good-bye (average price for used DVD) with apologies to ""Hardware Wars.""Oh, and wait'll ya' see the Giant Cray Super Computers in the background! Whirrrr! Click! Snap! Pop!"
4,IT CAME FROM BEANETH THE SEA,tHE ITEMS WERE RETURN THEY WERE NOT IN COLOR I ORDERED THE NEW COLLECTIONS THAT WAS UPDATED BY RAY IMSELF.IF YOU GET THE NEW COLORIZED VERISON I WOULD LIKE TO BUY.
4,Professional user only,"This is one of the best sander I've used.I own fabrication shop and use many sanders like makita and porter-cable. If you are planning to use the sander more than 8 hours a day, then it is it.the only downside is (1) it is 30 percent heavier than the other (2) a lot of noise (3) some of the accessories are made in plastic. Older model were made with ALL metal."
1,Disappointing!,"I was assured that all the songs were ""Studio"" by the shop. So I bought it, only to find ""Sweet Caroline"" to be LIVE and DISGUSTING!The person who compiled this box deserves this compliment: SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!RICK"
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"This is advertised as a 6 volt adapter, however when I hooked it up to my baby swing it just hummed. I checked the adapter with my meter and it is putting out 11.8 volts. JUNK! Amazon is awesome however and refunding me the money spent."
3,Good if you can look past Tim Sykes,I really enjoyed this series except for the idiot Tim Sykes. The show covers a different assortment of traders and market professionals which gives a nice overview of some financial people. The hard part to watch is a failed trader named Tim Sykes whose fund is down 36% since January 2006 and has had to resort to fighting for media attention since he can't make money trading. Some of his idiocy is funny at times and sometimes it is downright painful. A good show overall though if you like the stock market. There are only 6 epsiodes of this show and the extras are light and basically pointless so be aware of that before you purchase the 2 DVDs. It is a much smaller DVD set than the average buyer would realize. I know I was very surprised.
3,"Good, Not Great. Season 2 is better.",I started watching during season two. After season two ended I decided I should see season one. It's obvious the producers took a different approach to the show after season one. I'm guessing they did away with the show because I haven't heard anything about it since season 2 ended. Too bad.
5,My Wife is Excited About This Tool,The VB16Y is a remarkable tool. I'm building my own home and there are few significant tasks I can get a 5 ft. tall 105 lb. wife to do. But with the VB16Y I can set up an assembly line and my wife now cuts and bends rebar. It's really that simple. The tool is light enough (around 45 lb.) I can bring it down to the job site. It's bends are repeatable and the tool is remarkably rugged. I bought mine used for our construction but if you are in the business you need this tool and I wouldn't be scared off by the price.
4,"More Insight than ""FISH!""","Johnny Yokoyama adds details and insights on the mind set of the fishmongers, not available in the more popular book, ""FISH!""It's about BEING world famous, not DOING things to be world famous. The subtle difference helps steer day-to-day decisions for each of the fishmongers and reminds them of their true goals."
3,Goofy Movie Good for a Laugh,"This has been out for a long time, but I hadn't seen it before until recently when I showed up for a defensive driving school and the instructor showed it on breaks and at lunchtime (to make the class more entertaining). This movie is kooky to the limit, and some may not be able to stomach it, unless they really like Looney Tunes Cartoon humor. There are a lot of nonsensical scenes and visual humor, but the best part is there are so many well-known and popular actors and comedians of the day in this movie. Ruth Buzzi was just a scream in her old-lady part, and Paul Lynde was the atypical nutty Indian Chief. In addition, Mel Tillis does his usual funny part of having to sing his lines to avoid stuttering. These, along with Kirk Douglas (the inept bad guy), Arnold Schwarzenegger (the incredibly stupid good guy -brother, what a goofy character he plays), Ann Margaret (kinda slutty), and a few others makes this a fun see."
4,The Villain WINS,This is A very funny yet clean family movie.A great chouce for your movie collection.
4,Perfect for the kids!,"When my grandkids watch a movie, I want them to watch something like ""The Villain"". They can learn about life later and enjoy this Road Runner like real action cartoon in the meantime. Been my favorite for 20 years."
5,We have waiting for this come out on video for YEARS !,We saw this movie when it was first released and loved it ! We have been searching for it on video for years. Kirk Douglas was great as the Villain and it was refreshing to see him in a different type of movie. A great family movie !
1,Bad disc,The movie is great but the disc was bad and wouldn't show the last 5 minutes. Why would you have a required no.of words?
3,So stupid it's funny,This is really not a very good movie. BUT...it's so stupid it's funny. I love the characters and Kirk Douglas is so funny as the villain. Arnold is very funny also even though he plays a nit-wit. I would recommend this movie to anyone that doesn't want to put any effort into trying to figure out a plot.
3,"They're ""just okay"".","I picked these up for my Lancer last week, and they're nothing to get excited over.The caps feel like chrome-plated plastic, which means that they're probably a bit more durable than plain plastic caps, but I'm going to keep an eye on these (and update this review) to see how well the plating fares after some time in bad weather and a few car washes.I especially liked that these are quite subtle. They matched well with the wheels that come on a Lancer GTS, and the logos are really only visible if you get down to look at the caps. However, the Mitsubishi logo was off-center on two of my caps. Not a big deal, but it reinforced the ""cheapness"" of the product overall.I'd buy them again, but I wouldn't pay more than a dollar per tire for them."
5,Great Donato,"This is a great video of a living Brazilian music legend. Playing with a quintet, Joao shows his fantastic musicianship and personality, playing his best compostitons. Highly recommended."
5,Great,"This item works great for me. Great price and really works well. Some people have complained that it smells bad when you take it out of the box, but I didn't notice that at all."
5,Son loves it!,"Well, I don't know what else to say besides... My son love it! Holds his guitar great and he put it all up himself and he is only 13."
3,Broke in Shipping,"This item would work great, if it didn't break in shipping! The top neck piece that connects the smaller upper holder broke off in shipping. I am not sending it back because I believe I can just sauder the medal back together. Just be warned. If you have a long shipping distance (like I do, to Alaska) be prepared for it to possibly break. Maybe buy a more expensive version?"
5,Great Item and Deal,This stand is exactly what I hoped it would be. It is all I want or need from a stand. I do not intend to travel around with it but it would be easy to fold up to do so. The strap for across the neck of the guitar to hold it into place is a great plus too. Can't beat it for the price and American Musical Supply shipped this item the next business day after ordering. Delivery cost was low and it arrived in just a few days standard shipping to Texas.
1,Stand was constructed incorrectly and doesn't work,"I have two of these stands and have used them for years, so I wanted to get a third one just like it, but the one I received from Amazon was drilled incorrectly and so if you put the bottom piece in, the stand falls over. (I've taken pictures, but there is no way to attach them here.) Unfortunately I threw the box away, as I couldn't imagine any way something as simple as this wouldn't work. That's my fault. I am going to wait until I find a box the right size and will return it. In the meantime, I'm buying the same stand somewhere else, because I'm concerned that Amazon may have more of these stands in stock that don't work. They should check."
1,Missing pieces,Arrived in a timely manner but was missing 3 pieces and now I have to return it... bummer
1,Damaged Goods!,"This arrived with one end of the security strap and metal part...Broken! OK...I bought it on sale and returning it would not be an option...it would cost as much to mail back as it did to buy it!Obviously it was not the packaging which was more than adequate and there were no broken off pieces in the box.Of course,I could not recommend this product to anyone...most disappointing purchase!"
1,Horrible Guitar Stand,"So I bought this thinking it would be a good first guitar stand. I read some of the reviews, some seemed like it would be a good product, and others not so much. So I took a chance to begin with. The main problem that I had with this stand was it didn't stand. When the guitar wasn't on it, it was fine. But once I added the guitar, it wouldn't stay standing up. It would either lean back or to the left or right. I would not recommend buying this item. I ended up returning it because I was so frustrated and disappointed with this product."
1,Didn't all Come!,"I received the box for the order and when I opened it and there was only the bottom part of the stand... There wasn't anything else, no security strap or bottom support holder."
4,Thumbs up for On Stage XCG4 Tubular Guitar Stand,"This is a great little stand. Assembly and dis-assembly for transport is a snap. Adjustable height. Light but sturdy, good balance, nice padding. I bought this in conjunction with another item from Amazon, so since the total order was over $25, the shipping was free. Great value for the price. I wish I had ordered two of them."
4,"Perfect for home use, Wide footprint.",Perfect for home or stage. Easy to disassemble/re-assemble. Nice wide footprint for stable base. A strong rubber band-like cross section holds guitar in place to guard against floor vibrations. Tubes are easy to break down and carry in a small tent-bag.
1,"Great customer support, poor product","The back leg of the tripod is too short, so the stand is unsteady. Both electric and acoustic guitars tilt backward and fall toward the floor when I place them in this stand. This is my first return ever as an Amazon customer. I was able to process the refund easily through my online account. In fact, I got a refund and didn't have to return the product; I'm thankful for this because the shipping alone may have exhausted much of the $12.99 refund."
4,Could be more solid.,But it works so far for my Gibson. I do feel like I should always keep an eye on it just in case it falls. Which it has once. But it was not on a totally flat surface and take this tip from me. That really does matter with this.
3,"Given the price, it's good","It looks the same with the picture provided. However, the problem is that it cannot stand stably. Therefore I need to put it against the wall...That's a pity..."
4,Pretty solid,"Easy to put together, looks good, it's a pretty standard stand.Lots of them use cast iron for the bracket at the bottom which holds it all together, this one doesn't seem to. The downside is it has a little less weight making it easier to tip with nothing on it. The upside is strength as temp changes cause cast iron to eventually fracture (that's how my previous one broke).The rubber strap to secure it is nice, but in my experience the rubber eventually tears after enough use. I doubt this will last more than a few years of regular use, however that's a very minor gripe.Would work just fine for pretty much any acoustic or electric of all sizes/shapes. I doubt you'll encounter an issue.For the price it's a good deal, can't go wrong."
5,Excellent stand,"This guitar stand is excellent. So well made and price is unbeatable. It has rubber on all surfaces that will have contact with instrument, so there will be no scratches. Love it!"
2,Not to my liking,"This is a derivative combination of psych rock and early British blues rock. Nothing daring, or new or interesting. I Don't want to be too harsh, but often this disc comes up on Amazon in searches or links from progressive rock from Italy. This disc may show glimpses, but not enough to be an engaging listen"
2,Not The Best of The Manhattans,The Manhattans have always been one of my favorite groups. I bought this cd for 3 songs because I'm a collector of music from the 60's and 70's. The rest of this cd is terrible!
4,Gastric Sleeve friendly,As a gastric sleeve patient I was looking for a high protein bar that would not be heavy on the stomach that was high in protein low in sugar. This is perfect and taste good too.
3,Hydrogenated fats!,"Great tasting, but contain hydrogenated soy and/or cottonseed oil and PH palm kernel oil!"
4,Good Protein Bar,"These are pretty good bars. I like that they don't have 30 grams of protein, so I can actually finish a whole one without feeling lethargic. They are low carb, which is kind of what I wanted...but I don't enjoy the artificial sweetener in it. I would honestly rather not have it sweet, but I'm sure most people won't find this an issue."
4,Good Stuff,I hate all traditional Protein Bars. I understand that this is not a protein bar but I consumed more protein than I would have otherwise. Definitely enjoyable to eat and makes for a great snack when I get home from work and head to the gym before dinner.
4,Tastes like a sugar wafer cookie!,"I love the concept of this power bar. The flavor was just like one of those sugar wafer cookies, so it was not hard to ""force"" myself to consume more protein this way. I'm not keen on white chocolate, though, so that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I would have preferred the peanut butter/chocolate one (which I've had and adore!!).These are excellent, though. Great source of protein. Don't melt in the heat. Taste good (use as a dessert!). Highly recommended for those who like white chocolate. Definitely recommended for those who need more protein in their diet.Munch on!"
3,Not as good as I hoped...,"Not a great taste...not a product I could honestly recommend. Also it is a wafer, not a bar...I would stick with a bar."
4,No Worries!,"Love these - perfection would be if it made no mess. They're delicious, just 'crumby'. They break apart into tiny pieces when you take a bite, can stain clothes if you don't know the crumbs are there.Eat on the go with caution :-)"
3,worth a listen,"A lot of 1 hit wonder retro bands out there at the moment, mobile delivers more then that. The music itself isnt something too original with bands like the killers, kaiser chiefs and the caesers which sound similair. But mobile still finds a way to be unique from all the euro bands emerging. Notable catchy tracks include out of my head, see right through me, and montreal calling. Not bad for a first cd, see where they go from here."
1,As bad as this movie is...,"At least there is an ending. Who keeps funding these shoddy attempts? Kinda makes me want to give this movie making biz a try. Anyone can make a better movie than this. The villian in this movie is never fleshed out, all he does is look at the camera and scream out... bad. There is no context for why they feel so theatened nor is there anyway to believe this race existed at all, they are just too hostile to ever exist. The (heros) main characters aren't any better. There is a point in the movie where they actually get away from the threat of an onslaught of demonic ghosts and there are about 6 heros left to hundreds of ghost beings. So, do they proceed and then come back with reenforcements? No. They comeback with the same paultry few that got whipped to begin with. Ridiculous. If you liked the Phantom Menace you may like this, however both are highly NOT reccommended."
3,"It was the Weirdest movie i've ever seen, but good","This movie was really weird, but in a good way. I liked it because it was something different. It was way out there,but was still good."
3,Not recommended for the average moviegoer.,"I saw this the first day of its release in theaters and I must say I had a good time even though I know it stinks.I give it 3 stars as a compromise because the right side of my brain wants to give it 5 stars for the guts it took JC to make such a messed-up, low-budget, gore-fest in the PC year of 2001 and the left side of my brain would give it a 1 star because no person in their right mind could like this trash.I'm glad I'm not one of those people!"
2,Tool concert on Mars,"If Marilyn Manson and Gwar fans held a Tool concert on Mars, and it was turned into a made-for-Syfy movie, you would have ""Ghosts of Mars"". I refuse to believe that John Carpenter had anything to do with this."
2,Ghosts of Mars,"2 stars is almost two too many for this lame SCI-FI. The special effects are the only reason I gave it a 2. The acting is pitiful in this movie. The screaming, possesed, Marilyn Manson look-a-like, was stupid and annoying. Why couldn't the leader of the Ghost be more of an organized type of leader sending his troops out to fight in a more rational strategy against the human invaders? Of course the human soldiers, cops, whatever, were idiots too. I just thought this movie was not thought out well, AT ALL!..."
1,One of John Carpenter's Worst,"There is'nt much to write for this film,other than it was really,really bad.There was nothing scarry in this film,the script,sets&effects were complete S$@!?*&%#!>!.In the end,you had people dressed in S&M gear babbling at the top of their lungs like infants(supposidy it was an ancien martian language)and that was laughable on it's own.This film is so bad,it does'nt even deserve a star,the scale should be going in the negative direction.I don't know what Pam Grier was doing in this film,or Jason Strathom other than to polish up their resumes&make some easy money.If you want to see some great John Carpenter films,see the original Freddy Kruger,or the remake of The Thing.This is one I'm sure John Carpenter is wishing did'nt bear his name,or was ever made."
1,My wallet will be forever haunted,"I thought why not... after all, it is a John Carpenter film and he did do The Thing... DON'T DO IT! The fact that someone took the time to put this on BluRay is beyond me. This is nothing more then a VERY low budget ""made for tv"" movie you'd see on the SciFi channel at 2am. I'll never get that time back - so please take this as a fair warning - some movies are only fit for the $1.99 dvd bargin bin, and this is one of them and only if it was purchased in conjunction with a $1.00 off coupon."
2,Another zombie movie,Watched this when I was in college.Thought it was going to be a cool sci-fi movie (probably because of the book)Realized that it was nothing but shooting and did not really reflect from the written version.
2,Ice cube?,"Ice cube in space? C'mon people be real here, he cannot even get off the front porch! I have seen Friday or whatever that was and yeah, get off the porch! Carpenter sux so bad nowadays it is just sad because he used to be so good. Now we have ice T in space oh sorry Ice cube and what next Vanilla Ice? Not worth watching unless you use it to torture your babysitter into giving you five dollars to spend at the arcade."
4,Triumphant return of Carpenter!,"Though John Carpenter had more ""misses"" than ""hits"" in the 1980's through the 1990's, this movie stands out. It features great direction, almost 3 dimensional characters, an orignal futuristic plot, and great music. In sum, it's pure Carpenter.Good DVD extras.Highly recommended."
3,John Carpender is back at it!,"Truly the movie isn't bad and not nessassarly one of Carpender's better movies. The flashbacks got annoying and sometimes this movie does get too hokey to the fact where it doesn't make any sense,but its fun and entertaining so its a great renter."
4,Carpenter returns to his hard action roots.,"Unfairly dismissed by both critics and fans at the time of its release, John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars is the cult director at his most b-movie retro. What Ghosts does it take the narrative of Assault on Precinct 13 (cops and criminals in an isolated police station find themselves teaming up to fight a hostile army) and sprinkles it with elements from Prince of Darkness and Escape from New York. The results might fall short of Carpenter at his best, but there is no denying the movie has enough energy (in the good, old fashioned rough and tumble sense - no wire-fu or bullet time digital hijinks found here, thank goodness) and humor to hold a forgiving fans interest. The only major flaw is a ludicrous about face attack at the 1:17 mark, other than that it delivers a fun little b-movie thrill."
5,Jon Carpenter's Dynamite Hit,"i have to say that ""ghosts of mars"" was too me worth the time to watch. i really enjoyed the plot, and the picture has a lot of action-very violent but i did enjoy it. it received good reviews by movie critics ebert and roeper. i think mr carpenter still has his magic and it blossomed in this one (ghost of mars). i recommend this film to mature adults. excellent"
2,Call the police a crime has been comitted,"John Carpenter and Ice Cube, this film should have been great, all the ingredients for a good film were here, but what did we get ?, elements of a zombie movie, elements of The Thing, elements of pitch black all good ingredients and a good director but this film just didn't hang together, the special effects had the look of the dodgier effects from total recall and the plot whoooaaaah ! it stank. I bought this film on the strength of the combined cast and director and wish I rented it first, Is it worth the cost of a rental Yes !! buying? well you decide but I'd rent it first and save your money for a better film."
3,Pass the cheese please...,"Even though it was a bit cheesey actor all groaning and moaning as if they were possessed... Ok, but it had action... and Ice Cube was meant to be an actor him and LL Cool J are really cool...and this movie made you kind of clinch you fists hoping the normal people would make it out alive... it was good I'd like to see a part two... worth the money to buy..."
2,Sham,The author of this book led a huge group of people down the path to financial ruin by PROMISING a better future through Amway.
2,Resolution popup is extremely annoying...,"It has a beautiful display, but if you aren't able to run a video game at 1280 by 1024 (which most new games this isn't possible unless you have an insanely fast PC), you will constantly get a ""popup"" indicating you need to change your resolution. This happens every 10 minutes or so during gameplay totally blocking your view of the game, forcing you to frantically find and press the tiny ""exit"" button on the display, to get back to the game. Why did NEC do this reminder thing? Extremely annoying to gamers."
5,"wonderful, warm, attractive boots",These boots are extremely attractive and warm. Other buyers thought that they ran small but they are true to size but not wide in the ankle area which keeps them snug and easy to walk in. You only need to wear a ultra thin sock as they are so very warm. They arrived quicker than any order I have ever placed and it was even during the Holidays. I already own these boots but ordered another pair for a gift.
4,Bearpaw Fur Boot,"The boots are great quality, and do very well in icy, snowy, and wet weather. Despite the overall durability of the boots the decorative straps on the sides are fragile and will break off if pulled."
