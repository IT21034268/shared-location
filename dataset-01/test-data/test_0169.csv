2,Dull and disapointing,"As said in previous review, this book is disapointing when you see how boring it is. Pages and pages related to irrelevant judicial sentences, promotions, etc. It's description of the combat and war crimes are bureaucratic, as describing a mechanical administration. From an academic point of view it is usefull, but only if you are interested in the grey facts or are working on this subject."
3,"A very interesting read, but could be tighter","Col MacLean has undoubtedly produced a highly authorotative study of the SS-Sonderkommando Dirlewanger, but my abiding impression of the book is that it could have benefited from some of the repetitive detail being relegated to appendices, such as the SS and NSDAP joining dates and numbers he gives for everybody mentioned in the narrative. I would also have been interested to read a little more about Dirlewanger the man, rather than the nonetheless interesting detail of the unit's deployments. Finally, some further analytical consideration would have been welcome - in places, the book reads more like a list of events without comment, but this is just a minor observation rather than a significant complaint. Well worth a read for the SS-student and lay reader alike."
3,Disappointed,"Not as helpful or as interesting as I had hoped. I can find better ideas for Asian modern decorating in my vintage issues of Architectual Digest, especially from the late 1940s through 1960."
2,Bare bones; won't hold a charge for long,"As some of the other reviewers pointed out, it is a bare-bones phone! The one I have now is the second U340 I've owned--I returned the other one because it would only hold a charge if I didn't use it! This second one also will not hold a charge for long if you actually make or receive calls. I've seriously considered switching back to my previous phone, which at this point is about four years old but was MUCH more reliable plus it has features that this one doesn't, namely Get It Now. Overall, I think if you're contemplating purchasing this phone, I would suggest you don't!"
4,An overview of God's plan in troublesome times,"Sometimes everyone needs to be reminded about the correct perspective on life. That is what this book does best - remind us that God gives us perspective, protection, purpose, and power. The book is divided into four sections based on those four items. Within each section there are several chapters. The chapters are well done and contain short stories to help illustrate the points being made. In addition, whenever there is a related Bible verse it is shared with the reader. One of the things that make this book unique is that it is not particularly focused on getting an emotional response from the reader but is more like a reminder of God's promises and the things that separate Christians from others. This positioning as more of a logical than emotional appeal may make it better suited than most as an appropriate read and source of encouragement for men. ""A Hope and a Future"" is a recommended read."
1,Is this a ballet or a stage play?,"I ask this because it was so horrible that I couldn't finish watching it and tried to not once but twice! I got through the first 40 minutes and there was more acting than there was dancing. the performance was filmed for TV, and done at weird angles. The characters were almost scary in there clown makeup and the little bit of dancing there was was mediocre at best. The part of cinderella was done by a dancer who looked almost past her prime and again there was more ""acting"" than dancing. I use the word acting loosely. I got this from Netflix, so I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this horrific version of cinderella.Personally, I like my ballets to be in front of an audience without any ""special effects"" added for TV viewing and I like my ballerinas to actually dance, not go around pinching Cinderella the first 1/2 of the production. If you want to be sure for yourself, rent it first before you buy. You will disappointed if you waste your money on this."
1,Ineffective makeup techniques,"I rented this video before I decided to buy it and I am glad I only spend $3.50 to rent! Her instruction and techniques are poor. She moves in front of the camera a lot, which completely blocks the model from view. Also the video is more like a commercial for her products rather than a guide that anyone can use. I would skip the video and hire a trained make up artist."
5,LOVE this pan!!,"As with a previous reviewer I use it a lot for brewing chai. The smaller strainer works great for filtering out the tea and masala. We looked for a LONG time to find a pan that works just right for brewing, straining, and pouring. The pour spout is EXCELLENT and although I bought it mainly for chai, I love to use it for EVERYTHING now. It is great for lentil dishes, ramen, again...everything.I have a lot of great pots and pans, and honestly, this is the pan I most often reach for now. We have the 2 qt. version. It is not to heavy for holding and pouring out."
5,Help with the Song Played on the Main Menu?!,"First off, does anyone know the name of the song played over the closing credits and on the main menu? It is absolutely addictive and I would love to know where I could get it. I checked out all the credits on the DVD and could find no mention of it. It does say that all music on the DVD is written by Peter, so perhaps it's from another Real World release?That being said, this concert film is mind-blowing!! Peter is still a performer of the highest caliber, regardless of age. True, Ged Lynch is no Manu Katche, but the band was superb. I had only heard Tony Levin's amazing stick bass, but had never seen him play it live before. What a trip! The props used are a joy to behold, but Peter is even more effective when it's just him at the keyboard. His opening version of ""Here Comes the Flood"" is incredibly moving. The sound is absolutely stellar and makes this a DVD that will be watched over and over."
5,Peter is the best !,"Incredibule! that DVD every song or very special the first time you gone a listened , you gone a be anxious to present to all your friends Growing up and Downside Up (guinness record i hope, you see,,,,,,)"
5,Growing Up- Live,"This is a great DVD of a great show. The songs are as powerful as ever and well performed. The effects, lighting and stage props are incredible, and the walking upside down part ('Downside up')is especially fun. Some of the more simply performed songs and less flashy stage tricks are also just as moving, Look at 'Signal to Noise' to see what I mean. This was an outstanding show live and this DVD offers a good representation of one of the concerts. The extras are fairly decent for a live DVD too! I wouldn't compare this to Secret World (as some other reviewers here have), in as much as I feel they are complimentary and one isn't better than the other, but different halves of the live show Gabriel puts on.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,November 4 can't get here soon enough.,"I saw Gabriel live in Detroit last December, and the show was, as expected, amazing. Given the care that Gabriel puts into his films, I expect this DVD will be as impressive as Secret World Live. A Gabriel concert is the closest thing to a secular epiphany.If you like Gabriel at all, buy it. If you need an introduction, buy it.Like the song says, What a show!"
2,Get Secret World instead,"Bought this thinking that the music off of the newest cd would be better live...Wrong! The only good things about this video were, obviously Tony Levin, but then all of the props Pete was using throughout the concert. The new drummer is the most boring guy to watch since Peter Criss...Although, his old stuff with KISS was fairly exciting...but this guy butchers classic songs. Then theres the fact that Pete also got rid of his old keyboardist - again. Now its a boring woman with no real show of talent. Pete also brought his daughter along, but she can get kind of annoying at times. Overall, if you liked UP, get this DVD; if you prefer classic Pete stuff, avoid this DVD."
4,"Not a Gabriel fan, but love this DVD","I've never been a huge Peter Gabriel fan. I bought ""SO"" when it was released, and I like it as well as his radio hits, but beyond that, I haven't paid much attention to him.The other day, I was flipping through the channels and came across this concert on the INHD channel. I was mesmerized.What a show. This concert is more like performance art than a rock show. Bike riding, walking up side down, rolling in a ball, all ""props"" that add to the excellent sound quality.Although I was only familiar with a few of the songs, I found myself enjoying this performance immensely. I bought the DVD the next day and have watched it (or portions of it) over and over.Even now, I still don't quite love the music as much as others, but the performance is enough for me to enjoy this DVD very much."
2,Bad scanning,I was terribly disappointed with the printing of this book. Jack Kirby's wonderful art was spoiled by bad scanning. I suggest you don't by this book without seeing it.
5,Fits like original equipt manufacture product,"Fits my older original Craftsman Rider Mower ys4500 w/42"" deck, I ordered the same chute 162803 from Sears Parts Direct and they turned the order over to ""Yard Products that is supposed to be OEM"" for this model Grass Catcher and Chute System. Their chute was an one inch too sloppy big front and back letting grass blow out and the chute stops up. Plus it didn't fit the top chute."
5,WONDERFUL WONDERFUL MOVIE,I loved this movie. I wrote this movie (with partner Tim K) based on David Mamet's play. It is fabulous.
4,80's movie,"A movie from the 80's for those who lived through that time. See Demi Moore prior to her ""enhancements""."
3,"this is kind of like ""Singles""...","in the sense that they use Chicago as a backdrop for the relationship between Moore and Lowe, ""Singles"" did this with Seattle. Also, the lead characters get bad advice from their friends in both movies that leads to a break-up, which may or may not be permanent. I watched this for the first time since '86 recently, and it is somewhat dated. But Belushi and Perkins performances still shine,and too bad the planned sequel for this movie was dumped. I was at ""Mothers"" in Chicagorecently, they still have pictures of the cast up on the wall. Look for a young Megan Mullaly in this movie, she plays Moore's ditzy friend."
1,dated,we've definitely progressed if what passed for comedy in the 80s (james belushi's character and dialogue) now just sounds sexist and offensive.
1,Not happy at all - DVD not working properly although suppose to be new,"Although I purchased a brand new DVD and expected it to be brand new I have to report that I am extremely unhappy as the DVD is not working properly and stalls frequently during the middle part of the movie.I was really looking forward to the movie as it cannot be purchased in SOuth Africa and I have been searching for it for a long time and therefore decided to get it from overseas, purchasing it through Amazon but am now really unhappy and would like you to send me a replacement as soon as possible or refund the money I paid for it."
3,"Entertaining, thought-provoking","An interesting and fun way to kill a couple of afternoons. The author makes it very clear that his purpose is to throw his opinion into the ring, and doesn't expect anyone to regard his choices as definitive. Having said that, I fully agree with his logic in having scientific and technical innovators figure so prominently in the list; in fact, I would have ranked Newton #1, although I am in general agreement with his reasoning in putting Mohammed at a very high rank. One unfortunate flaw is the author's acceptance of the Shakespeare authorship ""controversy"" nonsense, but it doesn't really interfere with the main purpose of the book, and it is forgivable as I've seen many intelligent and well-meaning people fall for the ""Oxfordians"".An entertaining read, recommended."
3,Diverting but dispensible history book,"Hart's ""100"" uses poor historical method, contains many factual errors, and the ranking is generally unconvincing. It is by no means a scholarly historical work. However, it doesn't claim to be. The fact that it attempts to rank the 100 most influential people in history begs discussion, as the reviewer who believes that Steven Spielberg should be on the list in lieu of St. Augustine illustrates. The slew of top 100 lists that have come out in the last few years, such as the AFI Movie list, the top books of the 20th century, and ""The 100"", are useful catalysts for discussion, but should not be regarded as replacements for film and literary critism, or good history."
3,"Useful to read, but outdated","William Arnot lived from 1808-1875, so of course his writing is old. That means that his exposition of the parables does not take account of the massive advances in cultural understanding that have been achieved through archaeology and other disciplines since then. There have also been great advances in theology since then. Nevertheless, he writes with devotion in an attractive classical style. For the most part, Arnot's interpretations are moralistic, not benefiting from the more modern attention to kingdom theology. Thankfully Arnot rejects the modern preoccupation with classification of parables, saying 'when... you proceed to arrange them into separate classes, you are met and repelled by insurmountable difficulties.' But since it's free on Kindle, it's worth having if only for another useful reference to broaden your understanding and preaching."
4,"Good, not great","I love greatest hits album because it gives you a lot for your money, but this album was just good, not great. It has songs that I love but it also has different artist singing that are just...blah. I really love Miguel BOse's music and his voice is tantric, but the other artist in this album just don't measure up."
5,"The Best from Bunbury, this concert is electric!!","This concert delivers the great Bunbury on stage!!!With his maximum power and energy all the way aroundHis band does a great performance especially on songs fromPequeño and Flamingos, and when he goes back in time is incredible delivering songs from the great band ""Heroes""""La Chispa Adecuada"", ""Apuesta Por el R & R"" ""En Brazos de la Fiebre"" is too impossible to describe it.All I can say is: This is one of the best concerts in Spain and all the way around the world.A+"
5,"Major, Not Minor!","The term ""must-have album"" is so overused, but this CD compilation earns it for anybody who is a fan of punk, particularly hardcore.This is an awesome, uncompromising, incredibly powerful album that nicely captures the intensity and exuberant self-righteousness of Minor Threat. The raw speed and power of MT is still impressive, even confined to a safe medium like a CD. The anger, the energy, the intensity, the speed -- fantastic, track after track. Some of my personal favorites: ""I Don't Wanna Hear It,"" ""Straight Edge,"" ""Minor Threat,"" ""In My Eyes,"" ""Cashing In"" -- but all of the songs on this album are a kick!With all the punk-as-fashion stuff going on these days, this album should (hopefully) put the lie to the poser posse (""SLC: Punk,"" anyone?) and send them running for the next fad something quick. Which is fine by me, as it leaves the field open for folks (like me) who still love old-school punk."
2,I Don't Hear Whats So Speacial,"First off, I don't want to say Minor Threat sucks, I just don't hear any passion in their music. Alot of the songs sound the same, and the sound quality is horrible, but not in that cool Black Flag way. I understand that they are the creators of hardcore, but how did they get that title and not a band where you can actually hear the Hardcore sound (such as Black Flag, Bad Brains). I guess if you listen to music solely for the song writing, you will like Minor Threat, but if your looking for melody and musicianship, this album is a waste. Stick to Hardcore bands like Ensign, Snapcase, and Shutdown."
2,INDIAN IS THE STAR,"Watched this movie on a movie channel and when I saw it had an INDIAN MOTORCYCLE in it I had to purchase it. Even if the rest of the movie was "" not my cup of tea "" because of the content, seeing the INDIAN MOTORCYCLE used was well worth the price of the dvd.The end of the movie along with scenes featuring the INDIAN were the best part of the film."
4,Weird but enjoyable,"Being a Van Damme fan I enjoy all his films even the ones that the majority of people feel are lame. This film, however, isn't typical Van Damme but enjoyable none the less. What makes it weird is the way one minute you know you're watching an action flick then it seems to get dramatic then turns into a comedy. If your the type of person who feels comedy in action films don't go then don't buy this. Van Dammes quirky lines do tend to make this more of a comedy than an action film but it also has it's dramatic side."
4,Not official,"When you buy this, just beware that this is not an official release. It is a bootleg copy placed into a fancy box.But! If you really love Digimon and you have been waiting since you first saw it for it to be on DVD, buy it. It's worth the money.This box set only includes the episodes in English, and the sound quality isn't the greatest."
3,Low vision cards,"I bought these cards for my Mom who has ARMD. I also bought a brand that uses 4 different colors so that no two suits are the same color. My Mom likes the other deck better because she can differenciate the suits better, but her friends prefer this deck. I'm assuming that her friends like this deck because it is more traditional and is what they are use to. They all like the fact that the letters are so big though."
3,Very cheap looking,It's very small and low. Not sure how long my sun can use it. cheap looking the pictures are stickers. Not a real ride on but I got it so cheap that it's ok.
3,Fungi Intellecti,"I myself, living in the Northeast, bought this book hoping for a lot of specific information for amateur or wanna-bee shroomers. I was hoping for very specific information on where and when to find edible wild mushrooms in my area. But was profoundly disappointed in this pretty, and scholarly textbook. If you want to be a fungi freak, this is your book. But if you just have an insatiable appetite for mushrooms, and take nature walks anyway, so what the heck, I don't think this is what you'll be looking for."
1,"Do not, under any circumstances, buy this book.","This book misses one edible mushroom in particular that is of great interest to amateur hunters. Grifola frondosa is one of the world's best edibles and can grow to huge size. I am very surprised that an author with such prestigious honors missed it (although he did find a similar mushroom in the same group, the non-edible ""Berekley's Polypore""). Grifola frondosa is common and widespread, and grows up to a huge size. To write about each of these other mushrooms, and not to have at least walked onto frondosa, is impossible. I suggest the Audubon guide, although the pictures aren't as nice, the black and white plates in the back can help identify the shape of a mushroom more clearly. To make up for the keys in this book, it is easy to scrounge around the net. (Keys help identify mushrooms even if you have no idea what they are.) Best of luck in your hunting."
5,I use these cards every day!,"Our team of counselors attended an Optimal Thinking seminar that was set up by our leader. We resolved tough issues during the seminar, and it was wonderful. Our leader has purchased a set of emotional mastery wallet cards for each counselor. The cards have made a meaningful difference in the quality of my life. I use them to resolve the disturbing feelings I experience when I am dealing with disgruntled complainants. I also use the cards to show complainants how to master their feelings. I recommend these cards for everyone -- especially counselors, customer service personnel, students, and people in stressful work situations."
3,Blue Thunder Bowl ...,"An iron-plated Huey gunship with duel-mounted .50 caliber machine guns threatens to destroy the world. Only Roy Sheider can save the day by hanging off a flagpole on the side of a building and firing a rifle at Blue Thunder's gas tank, causing the shark to explode and then Sheriff Brody has to swim back to shore with a guy who has been ""counting money all [his] life"". Something like that. Blue Thunder had slightly less appeal than the hit tv series ""Airwolf"" (starring critically acclaimed alcoholic wife-beater, Jan Michael Vincent). As the film moves toward the end, you will look back and realize that the woman getting naked in the first 15 minutes of the movie was the best part ... and you will want to rewind it and watch that part again. If Popeye, Iron Eagle, and Red Dawn are in your movie collection, you may as well round it off and purchase Blue Thunder as well."
5,Easy as Pie,"This book allows the non sewer to make all sorts of great things. I just built a new house, and I wanted to decorate without spending a lot of money. I saved over $500 making these things rather than purchasing them. I do not own a sewing machine, but I made pillows, lampshades, draperies, and much more. This book tops my ""Best Buy"" list. Incredibily easy to follow!"
4,Definitely Worth A Look,"Even though I can sew, I still really liked this book. Most of the ideas are creative, unusual, and easy to implement. You truly can transform things and rooms with fabric, if you're willing to take a little time. It also doesn't lean too much toward gingham/ruffles/cutesy stuff, which is also a plus."
2,Good beta version,"You know this game is actually fun, it has some very good points. However it has way too many bugs. To make things worse when the patches come out to fix the hundreds of bugs all the playing you have done up until that point is gone since your save games will not be compatable with the patches. This is an unfinished game that has no business being sold as a complete game.I would say wait a month or two before purchasing the game. Once they get the patches out it will be a good game. Like I said I am having fun playing the beta, but it is very frustrating with the bugs and the thought that once they do fix it all my character information up to that point is gone."
1,UNPLAYABLE,"I downloaded the demo twice from two different sites and the game screen would not even load. So, I have no idea what the game is like. But hey, it's pretty pathetic when you can't even get a game company's demo to work and it's NOT my system because I am running a top of the line Dell; the fault falls on D.W.Bradley, Heuristic Park Inc, Dreamcatcher; all of them.A friend of mine bought the game for his new Dell system and couldn't get it to work either. Half the features don't even work! That's just sick. Pure garbage.So, this is what I think...1. Every single person that purchased this piece of trash should have their money refunded.2. D.W. Bradley and everyone else that played a part in the creation and distribution should be sued. (The last time I checked, there WAS and IS a law against false advertising).3. Every last copy in existence should be burned.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
4,Dungeon Lords,Great game even though you have to update it!!!!They should have not released it before the updates and waited to test it before all the errors in it. Hours of fun...!!!
1,just plain awful,"so bad... where to start?Lots of buttons and keyboard commands that don't actually do anything. NO AUTOMAP FUNCTION EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A KEY. The one positive review mentions a ""poster size map""- try a pithy glossy foldout roughly the size of an opened magzine. Does it help at all in the game? no- the map merely marks squigly borders to the interlocking corridors of wilderness.Combat? horrible. click till your finger is sore or your voice is hoarse. If you like being mobbed by 12 rabid rats repeatedly every 2 minutes you will like it. Using the bow, you can't actually aim your shots- even though the options menu has a setting for crosshairs, they do not appear in the game.I spent 40 dollars on this and tried really hard to enjoy it. It left me utterly disappointed. I want my 40 dollars back along with the 15 odd hours I wasted trying to enjoy this piece of rabbit droppings. Do yourself a favor and avoid this stinker even when it is in the $5 bin in 6 months."
1,Dungeon Lords? No Way....,"Do NOT buy this game. It is buggy like you wouldn't believe, the patch does not address even helf the issues.From the first when you go to create your character, the appearance function keys do not work, can't do the hair, skin coloring, etc, the buttons are there, they just DON'T work.So the patch takes that option out. Still talks about it over on the side though, but now there is no text on the buttons about it, just blank buttons. Lame.I spent $40 on this game and its sitting in a drawer now and will until they fix it, which knowing companies will be with an ""expansion"" which is REALLY a HUGE patch in disguise."
2,Forest Lords,"There are no dungeons in ""Dungeon"" LOrds. Although NPS will talk about it. They haven't been implimented in yet! I was going to rate this 3 stars until I found out how rude customer support can be to people. Downright smart-elicky. Someone reported that when he called about the lack of appearence change in this game they just said. ""Well that's not important to us now is it."" That is a perfect example of the big company with a big head. The game it'self is fun enough but you'll be disappointed to know that you cannot solve it! The objective is missing! Not to mention all the dungeons. What you do get is a lot of skills(which is a good thing if they work) but the don't. It makes little difference if you have a 1 or a 5 in your large shield because it is just a number and nothing more. my fighter moves no faster with a 1 in everything(except wheapons) or a 5. That stinks! And so does this!"
3,It's a good start,"Danni Ubeda was a huge surprise in the Operacion Triunfo II contest, since he has a very unique voice, not as melodic as others contestants, but definetely interesting. In this production, he has compiled many different styles, bringing us a quite refreshing cd. The duet with him and Marey, who probably has the most powerful voice of all, it's a charm. I'm pretty sure that he will do a great job and I look forward to listening to his second production, which will come out better defined and much better produced than this one."
5,Mind Blowing,One of my favorite books of all time. I dog eared so many pages and kept returning to them. Really creates spaciousness in my mind.
2,I've Got $17 Million!,"I just installed Quicken 2004 Premier after having used Quicken 99 for several years, then a brief stint with Money which I found infuriating. I had high hopes for the simple interface I came to know and love with older versions of Quicken. This version reminds me of Money. Like Money, it's online account synchronization is flakey at best. Upon setp, it connected with my bank, downloaded my transactions and reported that I had -$1.5 million in my checking account and +$18.5 million in my savings account. It probably goes without saying, but... not even close."
1,Do Not Upgrade,"I had been using Quicken 2000 which worked fine. The interface is decent and it did everything I wanted. I was suckered into 2004 by a good deal and some rebates. Worst mistake I made. The interface on 2004 (is bad. Quicken has decided, arbitrarily, to reduce the input screen, put banner-type ads on the bottom, and in general, not allow you to determine the look or functionality of the program. Plus, in importing my data from 2000, I found several errors that I had to manually fix. Who knows what else is lurking in there. My advice, don't upgrade. Intuit needs to take a different approach to how their program presents itself and what you're able to do with it. I hate this program and can't wait to dump it."
3,Rattle 'n Roll,"Profile Design Air StrykeIf the road you are cycling on is not smooth, the spring loaded arm rest rattle. It sounds like your bike is going to fall apart. I just did one ride so far and I thought about returning it for fixed arm rest. I noticed the fixed arm rest you lose handlebar space. It dose not look like you can fit your hands underneath and if you can that will probably be dangerous. I'll keep the spring loaded arm rest and come up with a simple fix for the rattle by using something like rubber bands and maybe a piece of soft foam. As I did my first ride with the rattle I was able to make the rattle go away by lightly touching/holding the arm rest."
2,Did Anyone Fact-Check This Book?,"When I read on page 39 of ""composer Moss Hart,"" husband of Kitty Carlisle Hart, I knew author Deborah Davis didn't know her stuff. Moss Hart was a great American playwright, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, in fact. He was also a great director. The original Broadway productions of ""My Fair Lady"" and ""Camelot,"" to name two of his successes. He was never a composer. Did anyone fact-check this book?"
3,Well Well Well..... We meet again Linda Blair..,"I mean where do I start? It's one of those movies where it's really good and bad at the same time. If you're looking for something like Re-possessed, then check this one out. If you're bothered by realistic visual effects, then steer clear. Merrily Merrily Merrily Merrily , life.....is......but....a.....dream......... ... ... ..."
3,What happen to Rumble?,"A song I haven't herd for over thirty years, it was the first song I learned to play on guitar. It brought back so many good times I had with my friends and they didn't even put it on the CD? If it was there I would have bought the CD but it wasn't. Sorry no sale."
5,12 Years Later,I still enjoy this collection as much as when I first heard them 12 years ago. An incredable balance of many types of music.
3,Un Muy divertido Disco,"Casi nunca me han gustado los ""SoundTracks"" pero este en particular me cautivo por varias de las razones: *La manera en que estas canciones entraron en la pelicula te ahcen disfrutar la musica mientras recuerdas la escena *Muchas canciones en realidad son fantasticas *Los dialogos de la pelicula incluidos * MISERLOU ! (I Love You Honey Bunny)"
3,Can't resurrect Lambert's career!,"Not a great movie, but a good time-killer on a lazy, non-football Sunday afternoon. Nice set up but then it doesn't know what to do for a finisher. I liked the serial-killer story but it falls apart about 2/3 the way thru. I like Christopher Lambert so it was watchable once."
3,"Ok for gory details, boring same ole same ole...","I saw this DVD as code 2. Lambert is getting old and his acting isnt getting any better. ""Seven"" was the first one of these kind of movies and by far the best. This movie is just if you are really in need of a movie on a late friday night. The gory details were very nice, but there was nothing ""new"" to the storyline and no real insight to the looneys mind."
1,At least it lost my data in the first week of use.,"This came preloaded on my iBook. The reviews were not good, but for free I thought I would give it a try. After spending half a day setting up my accounts, my data file is lost and the most recent backup doesn't have most of the accounts I added. I don't understand how anyone could trust this program with their financial information."
1,Made for Mac Users,"i've been a faithful mac user since the first one came out.I could never understand quicken (too complicated and boring).My needs are simple I need to figure out how much i make anddetermine where it goes. i have two kids so i need to save money for college and retirement. there isn't much left over for stock, mutual funds and bonds. if you want an intuitive, colorful web-based personal financial software...i strongly suggest www.moneypants.com"
4,Bored Is Great,"This is a great cd. The live version or Bored is great. Chino talks to the audience, ""Oh! He lost his shoe!"" ""Get the **** up!"" It's worth the cost if you're a fan. Get it. You'll be happy."
1,Empty Promises,"I purchased this disc and found it to be long on promise and short on delivery. The lecturer is obviously self-absorbed. He delivers light drivel as if it were high prose. I give the speaker a B+ for theatrics but an F for content, continuity, quality of recording, quality of editing...don't waste your time let alone your money."
4,National Lampoon Does It Again!!,"Everyone remembers the classics like Animal House and Vaction. Well this one will go down right along with them. National Lampoon has brought together a group of ""Reality Shows"" that the networks wouldn't show. How tired are you of the same old reality shows shown on tv. This will wake you up and make you laugh."
5,I'd give it more stars if I could,"This is the best collection of covers that I've heard since Siouxsie and the Banshees' THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS. In my view, what makes a great cover version is when the artist(s) approaches the song differently, with a completely different interpretation. Simple Minds know how to do this beautifully.Much of the album has a modern, often techno bent to it. This is a good thing if you like techno music but get bored with the repetition and start to long for actual songs and substance (like me). There's not one bad song here, the selection is excellent although the last one, ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" is a bit of a throwaway dance version - but no matter.""The Needle and the Damage Done,"" ""For Your Pleasure"" and ""All Tomorrow's Parties"" make a most exquisite song-cycle and are standouts among standouts! Highly recommended!"
4,More good stuff from a GREAT band,"Simple Minds is my favorite band. That's why this album is a hard one to score - it's good, but it's not original material, and that's not exactly what I want to see from the Minds. That said, there's still some very good stuff on here, even if it doesn't seem like an out-and-out ""new"" record. Fortunately, ""Cry"" came out some months later, so it's less of a disappointment on that level. Fans of the Minds shouldn't be without this one."
1,A step back...maybe more,"Reading past reviews I cannot do butwrite down a few comments.At first, I am a huge SM fan since 1988..and I am still supporting the band in the last new tours around the world!! they are back with a new album (CRY) and some new compilations (Early Gold, The Best of, and such).But...NEONLIGHTS is really a bad album. The idea was great...a cover album from the best scottish band ever!! But I believe the selection of songs is quite strange and arrangements are quite simple. Some stuffs like the title track ""neonlight"" seems a funeral procession.If you are a starter: NEW GOLD DREAM is the best start up. If you already like SM and are wondering whether to buy this CD or not, the answer is: NO. wasting money.Enry"
2,Vulgar,"I may as well confess it -- I am not a fan of Froggy.We've read a lot of Froggy, and I feel like I've given him a fair shake. My kids like Froggy, but then my kids are enchanted by the experience of being read to, so they like most books.Froggy goes Swimming is about the only Froggy book I can enjoy, and even then, Froggy backtalks a lot and there is stupid slapstick pants-falling-off humor.Froggy goes to the Doctor has Froggy misbehaving quite a bit -- sassing his mother, throwing a paper airplane in the waiting room that hits the doctor in the eye, yelling into the stethoscope, kicking the doctor during the reflex check. And then the doctor unnecessarily takes revenge on Froggy by joking that he has to get a shot. I'm not much on grown-ups taking revenge on children.Eh. I think my kids can figure out enough ways to misbehave on their own. If I wanted examples of bad behavior beamed into their eyeballs, I wouldn't have cancelled the cable TV."
1,Another inappropriate Froggy book ...,"Just more of the same Froggy style. Froggy is disobedient and his Mother does not seem to care. This one with the added part where the doctor threatens to give Froggy a shot but he is just kidding! Please! Shots are scary enough for young children without the fear of the doctor teasing them about it. I do not like the constant ""underwear"" humor of the Froggy books either. I prefer books for my children that model obedience and respect and moral behavior so Froggy books are out for us. We wil not be borrowing any more of these from the library let alone buy any!"
2,Route 66; EZ 66 Guide for Travellers,The book was not ery helpful. No color pictures really let it down. It was a little hard to follow.
4,Get Your Kicks on Rt. 66,Lots of information on what to see an do along Route 66. Maps are a little hard to follow.
5,Route 66,"I travelled in spring 2007 on Route 66 from Springfield, MO to Barstow, CA. This book was an indespensible guide to the mother road. Concise easy to read directions with detailed maps. Chock full of places to see along the way. Great for an actual trip or an armchair journey. Get you kicks on Route 66!"
5,Dad loves it,"I purchased this book for my father, who is an avid collector. He is well pleased with the information this book contains."
2,Mildly Amusing Roger Corman Hokum,"""Swamp Women"" is generally regarded as one of the worst films by B-movie auteut Roger Corman (it was on ""Mystery Science Theater"" as well as in the Medveds' old book ""50 Worst Films of All Time""). It's the story of four tough-talkin' prison girls who go to a swamp to find some hidden diamonds. Along the way they kidnap a strapping young man and his cowardly wife, who abruptly dies early on. This isn't one of Corman's more entertaining cheapies, although it has its moments. The alligator wrestling scene is a high point in the history of bad movies, and the hilariously macho prison girls (including regular Corman leading lady Beverly Garland) inspire a few giggles.The DVD from Brentwood is, unsurprisingly for a bargain-bin disc, unexceptional. The colour image is murky and faded, while the sound often seems muffled. That being said, I doubt there are any pristine versions of ""Swamp Women"" to use as a master. There are no extras."
2,Bayou Babes,"I bought this movie thinking it would be an old horror movie. I can't say I was necessarily disappointed since I was still mildly entertained. To sum it up 3 tough as nails criminals (haha) and an undercover cop go into the jungle to find diamonds. They come across some guy and his girl, kidnap them and their boat. Then lots of nothing happens but they still film it anyways. Also, an animal was severely injured during the making of this film, so beware. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody who doesn't already have a passion for olden day movies. Although it does have its funny moments I assume most will fall asleep like the people I watched it with."
1,Unbelievable and Unbelievably Bad!,"Brooks' muse deserted him long before this film ever got underway. As it limped along, you could almost hear him thinking out loud , ""What ridiculous situation can I put our hero in next?"" This is one long, and boring film."
3,PITFALLS OF BANKING ON ONE JOKE,"The Muse is not necessarily an insufferable movie, it has its rewards, notably some interesting jabs at the Hollywood mindset, cameos from famous directors including big tykes like Martin Scorcese, Sharon Stone's fizzy performance in the title role, and Brooks' typical enactments of exasperation that build to deliciously juvenile outbursts.The problem is that its low-key shaggy-dog story has plenty of flat stretches, and its reliance on basically one in-joke premise fizzles out much too quickly.It's the sort of Hollywood-punches-Hollywood theme you've seen many times before and several times better, like with The Player. Even the continuous stream of cameos from celebrities becomes tiresome after a while.What the movie needed, ironically, is some inspiration. It may be a decent rental to pass a particularly sluggish afternoon, nothing more."
3,"Movie OK, but marketing lesson rocks","I watched this movie because I heard it was a great lesson on marketing and sales. I'm certain that wasn't the intent of movie, but it really is a great lesson on marketing and human psychology.The character played by Sharon Stone provides her services in exchange for unreasonable demands, but yet her customers beg her for more.The lesson of the movie will spoil it, so I won't disclose it, but you'll have to watch the movie to get the lesson."
4,The Muse,"If you are looking for an uplifting movie, during these difficult economic times, this film may just be the inspiration to give you that lift. The main character, a self-centered, screenwriter (Albert Brooks), has gone dry and now has no new writing ideas & desperately needs new inspiration. So he does what many of us wish we could do, he requests the services of a high maintence Muse (Sharon Stone) through the rcommendation of best friend (Jeff Bridges). It turns out that the Muse has more inspiration for everyone around him. His long-suffering wife (Andie MacDowell) finally gets her chance to blossom & develope from the inspiration of the Muse. The demands of the Muse are hilarious and without realizing his situation the screenwrter comes up with a potentially, money-making script. After watching this film you come away with a positive vibe...."
3,Sharon Stone proves what she is worth,"The Muse is a gentle little comedy from Albert Brooks featuring Sharon Stone as a muse that comes at a very high price. What makes this movie special is Sharon Stones performance. She proves she is not just a former model, but a very gifted and talented actress as well. She seems to be picking better roles these days, and staying away from the typecasting. The script is light-hearted and sweet, and always fun to watch. All in all, a very entertaining film that suggests the best muse is the one inside of us."
4,"Very pleasant, warm film, not without its originality...","I enjoyed this film, but I must say right away that it is not funny as in ""huh-huh, what a good line/a great joke...huh-huh"". It is nice, pleasant, at times witty, but not overly funny. The best part of this film is the ending, which I could not have predicted in millions years...Basically, this film is about one Hollywood writer, who is on the verge of mid-life crisis and writer's block, which is the result of the mid-life crisis.Watch this film, even if you could care less about Hollywood writers and their problems. If for nothing else, watch this film to see Sharon Stone being stunningly gorgeous [as always], while constantly changing her amazing wardrobe!"
3,Not Ambler's Best,"I've read almost all of Ambler's novels, and this is my least favorite. The premise (post-WWII, an American lawyer must track down the rightful owner of a German-American inheritance, which requires sorting through a complicated cast of potential heirs and wartime secrets) is intriguing, but once the action moves to the finale in Greece, Ambler seems to have run out of ideas. The resolution comes about through the seemingly out-of-character and unexplained actions of the protagonist's female translator; Ambler wrote far better women characters than this (in, for example, State of Siege), but his treatment of this one is really just sexist. It almost seems like he is projecting some sort of personal bad experience with a woman into the novel. Anyway, the result is an unsatisfying ending that isn't worthy of the buildup and backstory he began with."
2,Disappointed,I am very dispointed with with this CD. I am only 17 and i have known all of these songs without entering a club and they are so old and over played. I have even heard of few of them on z100. I bought this CD in hope it would be better. I also do not like the spainish music on the cd.
1,Soo disapointing,I was so excited to get this CD and then I listened to it. There is one good song on here and thats Cascada's Everytime We Touch. And thats it. seriously. Out of a 2 disc set thats all there is worth listening to. The songs are cheesy and outdated already. The other review was right when it said NO respectable club in New York City would play this crap. I am soo disapointed. :(
1,"Fake, Phony, Fraud","Google this guy and see what you are in for if you buy his stuff. He has left a trail of broken hearts, families, and bank accounts from South Flordia to Glen Mills, PA. Don't waste your time or money on his stuff."
2,Spanish idioms,"My wife and I have been studying Spanish for several years and use the Big Red Book of Spanish Verbs almost daily. I thought this would be a good addition but, in truth, it just sits on the shelf. Maybe I just haven't taken the time to figure out how it works, but I rarely find what I'm looking for when I pick it up. I guess I can say it's not like a dictionary."
1,results comedic at best,"I bought this on a lark a couple nights ago just to see how well it worked, and then checked the reviews here. Initially I wondered if a competing manufacturer was placing negative reviews here, but WOW. The first night, I weighed in at 172 pounds and 20% bodyfat, (professional tests usually place me closer to 7%, with a fair six pack).The next morning, the weight still seemed accurate, but I was deemed 40% bodyfat before attending to the restroom, and 24% afterward. Tonight I weighed myself again, and in only 24 hours I'd apparently lost 24 pounds and 7% bodyfat. But less than a minute later I'd somehow gained 3 pounds, while down to 15% bodyfat.The scale seems entirely too fickle. Maybe the room is a little cooler than it was before, and I'm taking the test at a different hour of day, but such large changes in measurements across the board are uncalled for. And just think, this was the most expensive scale at the store I'd been at."
1,Worked for 2 days. Horrible display,"In theory, having all the information on the screen is a great idea, but with the reverse LCD screen, nearly all the screen is illegible. It's nearly impossible to read the body fat percentage.The worst part is that the body fat portion went haywire after the 2nd day. The first two days, it showed 17% body fat, which is in agreement with my previous scale. Since then it consistently insists that I have 49% body fat! I'm 5'8"" and 151 pounds....Build quality looks great from the top, but once you look at the bottom, very cheaply manufactured plastic is all over the place."
2,Not consistent,"This scale is not consistent. I bought this at walmart, then after using it for a week, i realized that within the span of a few minutes i would get about four different bodyfat and weight measurements. So I decided to check the amazon reviews to see if maybe I had a defective scale, or this was a common problem. The only reason why I decided to give it two starts is because, the features that it has are cool, for the price (39.99 atWalmart), (weight tracking for 4 users, body fat measurements, etc.). But only if they worked..."
5,Words cannot describe.,"Fugazi were (are) by far the best band of the 90s. Don't just buy this album- BUY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEIRS. I can guarantee that their albums will forever become among your favorites. I got hooked in 93, and I still love them.But do yourself a favour- don't buy them on amazon or in a store. Buy them from the label, www.dischord.com, as their cds are postpaid and much cheaper."
1,Looks good on picture but...,I had to return it immediately when I opened the box. On the picture it looks more blue than purple.
1,Anyone else had problems?,"I get to Chapter 14 or thereabouts, and - Aaargh - I'm back on the menu screen. Right at the end of the film...A re-press please, Mr Macabro!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Anyone else had problems like this?"
4,For the beginer an excelent introduction to ASP's,For the beginer this is an excellent book. However i feel that it realy requires a good ssystem set-up ideally running IIS 4.0 to get the most out of this book. This book shouldn't be read begining to end to get the most out of it. It should be read with the intention of using it as a reference and reading the appropriate sections when required.
2,THIS BOOK IS TERRIBLE.,I MADE IT TO THE END OF CHAPTER THREE.THIS BOOK DISCUSTED ME A GREAT DEAL. MANY MANY CODE ERRORS!!!!! I'M TAKING IT BACK
2,"Typos, typos, typos...","Though Hettihewa is fairly decent at teaching ASP (I was able to grasp the concepts), the number of typos, particularly in his coding examples, made it consistently difficult to figure out what was going on. I kept stopping to try to figure out why a certain snippet of code was written in such a way, only to eventually discover that it was a mistake. Over and over and over again, to the tune of about one significant error per page. A misspelled word here or there would be one thing, but when you're trying to understand code, the devil is in the details, and the devil had a field day here. On top of that, as mentioned in other reviews, is Hettihewa's unreasonable passion for all things Microsoft. I'm no Microsoft basher, but quite frankly, this guy must be getting paid off. All said, you *can* learn ASP from this book, but I would bet there are much better books for the task."
4,Tonya.......will you marry me?,"Ok never mind the fact that I am married already.Let me recount what I thought of this book, the story line is a fresh new one, I liked that aspect.Do get yourself a better editor, it will not make the story any better it will just enhance how it reads.Don't let peoples negativity stop you from writing, you have a unique talent for making words on paper come alive for the reader. Stick to your guns and keep hitting those keys.A very interesting and enticing story, it is now on my recommend list."
4,The Third Story Is The Charm,"Though I like Jess Michaels, the third story in this anthology, Border Lord, by Julia Templeton, is the charmer. This romance is hot as you-know-what, and witty to boot. I liked it so much I bought it as a single story on Kindle! The first story in the book is slow, and never quite appeals to me. The second story is better, but both are completely overshadowed by Border Lord. This is just my opinion, but I hope it helps."
5,Love the size!,"Should be able to help my mother with her cold that she keeps getting back, so i will give you all an update soon!"
4,Good stuff,"This is good to take every day. It does not replace a good diet, but if you eat well and take this it is GREAT. If you eat like crap and take this it won’t do you any good."
4,Fast Shipment,"Was very happy with how fast this came to me. Big bottle, lots of caplets. Just started taking these 3 days ago. Hope this works."
1,The Smell is Terrible,I have been taking Fish Oil for years - great for the body. I thought I'd try this brand...thinking Fish Oil is Fish Oil...and this was a good price. OMG...the smell is overwhelming when you take off the lid. I suffered through a few of them and called it quits. I'll pay extra and get the brand that doesn't emit that terrible odor.Kirkland Signature Natural Fish Oil Concentrate with Omega-3 Fatty Acids - 400 Softgels
1,Too large for human beings,I cannot rate the quality of this product as the pills are huge and i nearly choked trying to swallow them. I do think though that horses would be okay with them.
3,Triglycerides vs. Ethyl Esters,"Fish oil supplements come in two forms: Triglycerides (TG) and Ethyl Esters (EE). Majority of fish oil supplements on the market is Ethyl Esters (EE) because it's much cheaper to produce EE than TG.However EE is a synthetic substrate from micro distillation of crude fish oil and ethanol. So it's not really a ""natural"" supplement. EE also produces more side effects than TG because it's a synthetic substrate.Michael Gross, MD, and Susan Klein, ND wrote an article on Triglycerides vs. Ethyl Esters, it's on the net. It's a good reading material.This Kirland fish oil is using EE, that explains the low price. It's a good option if you can't afford the TG. But if you have a sensitive stomach and need to take fish oil, then look for one made with TG."
3,Watch out,"At least a couple of these softgels turned up empty and leaked over the others causing a stale, fishy odor. Otherwise a good bargain."
4,Broken platic wrapper but sealed,Came with broken plastic wrapperIt has a lot of pills and there pretty large.Ingridients nob specicific or accurate.Very low those of omegas.
5,"Solid Product, Good Price","I bought as a supplement for my dog. He has very sensitive skin and coat issues and needs fish oil daily as a way to help prevent hot spots. I found this product at a much better price than what I pay in the store. Was a little concerned about the quality, due to the low price, but there haven't been any issues at all. I will be purchasing more."
4,Great Teen Sex Comedy,"An amazingly hilarious, Seth Green is amazing as an Amish guy. Highly recommend the unrated edition. On top of over the top sometimes cheesey humor, it actually has a decent story behind it."
3,Funny at Times,"This movie was funnier than I expected it to be. Too many of todays movies are crude, simplistic with stereotyped predictable plots that simply do not compare to most of the old movies except in their new technology. The political correctness and contempt for traditional values make them distasteful if not repugnant. Despite the ample skin, this movie was actually funny in spots. I got it because of its Blu Ray format and because so many others looked boring."
4,One of the best of this genre,This is probably one of the better teen comedies to come out since American Pie set the trend - Would defiantly recommend if those kind of movies are your thing. Hope they make a sequel!
3,Watch the theatrical version first,"Heed the director's advice and watch the R-rated theatrical version first. If you enjoy the R-rated cut, you can check out the unrated version. The unrated version is actually a joke, a jab at all those ""unrated"" comedies on DVD.The movie itself is pretty funny, and the picture quality on this Blu-ray Disc is very good. Unfortunately, due to having two different versions of the film on one disc, there wasn't enough room to include HD audio."
4,Nice Job MLB,"Though MLB is not known for their film production like the NFL is, this DVD was done well. A little to much ""curse"" talk, but a great reveiw of a long waited for season.Every Red Sox fan must have this along with Faith Rewarded."
2,Need all the games!!!,"My husband and I are from Mass and he is stationed out in Cali. He is a hugh Red Sox fan, and was deployed during the series. Anyone know where I can get all the games on dvd?"
2,Typos galore,"The format and the topic could have made for an excellent book. However, the number of typos in the book makes one consider whether to believe the facts as they are stated. According to the book, JFK began campaigning for president in 1970 (pg. 295); Guissepe Zangara left Chicago on December 21, 1932, and by February 15, 1932 had not returned even once (pg. 129)....I could go on, but it is very difficult to take serious any facts in a book so strewn with errors. I don't know who was more careless...Ms. Laucella, or the proofreaders responsible for letting this book go to press.Frankly, Ms. Laucella should be ashamed to have such a sloppy work on the market with her name on it."
2,the book missed the target,"This book is a list of famous cases from the son of king David in 990 B.C. to the Isreali Prime Ministe Y. Rabin in 1995 A.D.While packed with entertaining stories and useful background information and aftermath, many contemporary cases are packed with outdated information or even plainly wrong. The format is fine for a quick reading on famous homicides, but not more than that. Internet provides much more useful information both in quantity and quality."
4,finally.,"I am so glad this finally came out on DVD. True, it's a bit short on extras, but us Police fans are so anxious for any new material it doesn't matter. The footage looks pretty good on DVD considering it's from 1984. I guess I can finally trash my old VHS copy. LOL."
5,"Great, but too many special effects","This video showed the police at their best. Playing favorites shuch as ""Can't Stand Loosing You"" and ""Walking On The Moon"". Though there were too many special effects I could stop watching it over and over again. The Police know how to put on a show! :)"
2,Not Great,"I'm an editor and a huge Police fan. I bought this to prove to somebody how awesome a band the were. Fail! The person spent the entire time scrutinizing the editing which is maybe the worst, large name band, concert video ever. Now to be fair I feel I should say that the people who have given this four and five stars apperently did not have the same experience as I did. Hey, perspective is everything, but if you buy it and hate it you can't say you weren't warned."
4,forget U2.the police were the best band of the eighty's.,"this is a great dvd.sure there are alot of crowd shots,there are some amusing effects put on in the editing stage,and i have watched this numerous times and i do not recall any shots of sting flexing his muscles or running his fingers through his hair.what is on this dvd is hands down one of the greatest frickin'bands ever to grace the planet.if you have any interest in the police at all this is a must have.the audio is fantastic,the images are crisp and clean,and sting, andy, and stewart play just a fantastic show.i never had the good fortune of seeing the police in their prime,so if you didn't either it would serve you well to buy this post haste.if you want the audio of this show buy the police live double disc.disc 2 is this show in its entirety.also be aware police fans on sept.12 stewart copelands ""police home movie"" titled everyone stares will be released.enjoy."
4,A hot blooded Latin master piece,"The tale of the early days of a Brasilian town are told by Amado in a most erotic action-like way. Beneath the lust, the filth and the passion, Amado revieles the world of a carring and human writer, and leaves the reader wondering if anarchy might really stand a chance. This book is easy to read and a must for Latin literature fans."
4,Weird but extremely funny,"First off, this movie has NOTHING to do with the subject of TS/TG. Even though men play the parts of women, they are playing the parts of REAL woman, not TS, TG, or drag queens. That said, I laughed throughout the movie. Some parts was just a little sick , but I have a warp sense of humor so, I found it funny. I recommend if you watch it, to skip the beginning credits. It's very annoying."
5,Unexpected Laugh Riot,"Sometimes, buying or renting an independent film can be a little risky, so I did not expect much from a low-budget movie starring three drag queens. While the popcorn popped, I started to realize that this movie was going to be one to remember.The interactive menus are introduced with humorous dialogue between four of the stars and there are hidden comedy snippets that can be found (on three menus) with a few creative arrow key combinations.The movie's plot is not entirely believable, but the drag queens deliver some punchlines with both comedic effervescence and excellent timing that, well, only drag queens can.I am still not a drag fan, but after watching this movie several times (with comentary and subtitles on for variety), I can say that this movie is definitely one for most video/DVD collections. Go buy it now."
3,A history of the mirror in France,"Even though mirrors are a commonplace of everyday life and an essential part of modern technology, suprisingly little has been written about them, making this charming little book a welcome addition. It might more accurately have been subtitled ""A history of the mirror in France"" since it concentrates almost exclusively on that country. Subjects include the manufacture of mirrors, their use in decoration, art, literature, theology, and most especially their psychological effect on self-image - and of course their erotic implications. The author says virtually nothing about optics or technology, and the illustrations are few and poorly done. This is not a must-have book, but if you are interested in mirrors, French culture, or cultural history, it is worth reading, and would be an appropriate gift for the mirror-obsessed individual in your family."
3,Star power is about all this comedy-actioner has in terms of consistency,"Dir. John Badham. Stars: Mel Gibson, Goldie Hawn,David Carradine, Bill Duke, Joan Severence andStephen Tobolowsky. The best 15 mintues of thiswell made but highly unlikely film are 7.5 minutesin the beginning when Duke picks up Carradine atthe prison he is being let out of in upstate NewYork and the 7.5 minute final fight scene betweenCarradine and Mel at the end. Duke and Tobolowskyget killed way before the end and ditzy, spoiledrich j.a.p. Hawn whines her way through thismovie to the point of distraction. Us guys wholike actioners could hardly wait for the Mel v.Dave fight at the end, though because of Carra-dine's age it isn't as good as Carradine v. Nor-ris in the end of Lone Wolf McQuade! Still it'ssort of worth the wait. Good movie despite flaws."
5,Action Packed Fun,"This is a fantastic film if, unlike me, you manage to secure a version that plays in the United Kingdom! It is fast paced, extremely funny and unpredictable. It has something for the romantics as well. How could it not be good with Mel and Goldie playing in the title roles! A definite must for any video collection which is why I tried to secure it on Amazon. I sent back my first copy because it wouldn't play in the United Kingdom and was sent the exact same version again!! How frustrating is that! I could play it on my computer and have a very bitty picture with audio which is frustrating. My advice is don't buy it if a pop up advises you that it mightn't play in your region - I disregarded it to my cost. I saw this film years ago and it is brilliant. I intend to go to my local store to order a version that plays in the U.K. since Amazon were unable to provide me with one. Their version is for the United States."
1,Do not buy this product,"This has got to be the worst mp3 that I have ever used. I purchased it refurbished thinking it was a great deal at $82, but was I ever wrong. It takes forever to transfer songs. I am guess 1 minute per song. The battery life lasts only about 4 hours. When charging, the unit can not be turned off and that gets very annoying. The software is the worst I've ever seen. It uses Music Match Juke box. The software makes me rename all my mp3 files unless I pay for the upgrade. What the hell is that? I purchased a product, I expect it to work without having to pay for more. Playlist created on Music Match can not be transfered to the unit unless you want to transfer the songs again. It takes forever to create a playlist with the songs on the unit.I WILL NEVER BUY AN MP3 PLAYER FROM PHILIPS AGAIN. I WILL NEVER BUY A PLAYER THAT USES MUSIC MATCH JUKE BOX. I SUGGEST YOU GUYS DON'T TOO. IT IS LIKE BURNING MONEY."
4,coffee pot i,"i really like this coffee pot. i used to have a big one which i really didn't need, and it was a pain trying to fill it. i like having a part that i fill with water rather than using the carafe. the separate lid makes loading the carafe into the dishwasher possible, another plus. the only thing i miss is automatic cut off. the first day i used it, i totally forgot about that and was wondering where the aroma of coffee was coming from. unfortunately, i realized what the problem was when i started to smell burnt coffee.all in all, i really like the pot very much."
3,Warranty,"We love the coffee maker as the coffee is extremely hot. One of the rubber legs has broken off of the bottom and it is now lopsided. I purchased this product on 082511, called for a replacement part (within year warranty) and they would not send me a free $1.50 part said I would have to fill out a form and submit a request for a free part. Give me a break, won't buy another product from them ever."
4,Good coffee.,"This is a great coffee-maker.I would have rated it 5 stars had it not been made in China. No where in the description did I see country of origin; Zojirushi has always been a Japanese product. However, I do have to say it makes a good cup of coffee."
4,"Good Coffee, Bad chemical smell at first","Coffee tastes fine, the maker is fairly quick and is an attractive design. I like that it is small. I rarely need more than a few mugs so the 5 ""cup"" size is perfect. I've been through several pod makers too, and was rarely impressed with the taste. I did find one good tasting brand via mail order, but the pods were VERY expensive.Before I used it, I ran several pots of water only in an attempt to get rid of the chemical smell. It was slow going so I soaked the parts I could in water with baking soda. After a few more cycles with water, the smell is gone. I had this issue with a recent Krups coffee maker too.So...haven't had too long, but like it so far. I give it 4 stars because of the hassle of removing the chemical smell."
2,disappointed,"was attracted to good looking coffeemaker and purchased because of Zojorushigood reputation. This product is made very flimsy and overpriced. Coffee filterand lid combination makes it awkward to pour. Would have been proud to displaymachine on my counter, very disappointed"
5,really good tasting coffee,i just got this zutto coffee maker it is very nice and its so small i was suprised how hot the coffee is from it cause it only has 650 watts. the coffee is very flaverful its easy to use i think the coffee from the zutto is better than my bonavita i really like it
5,what a great little coffee maker!,"I took a chance on this guy, and glad I did! What do I love about it? Mostly, that it's efficient. Due to the cone style filters, it takes less coffee grounds to make a good strong cup of coffee than the old basket types. (2 1/2 - 3 coffee mugs). I love the separate water carafe, it makes refills and cleaning so much easier. I love the color...so hard to find a coffee maker that isn't white or black. Really the only downside, and this is a very small one, is that it doesn't have an automatic shut off. I would prefer that just for safety issues, but it's not really a problem. It did take a minute to get used to the filter basket in the carafe, but as other reviewers have stated, all it takes is a thumb on the tab as you pour to solve that problem."
1,Not a good coffee maker,For the price of this coffee maker it was built very cheaply. It also has no auto shut off and you cant find coffee filters that fit it unless you fold them.
4,Good for 1-2 mugs,"It's good but I have to pour coffee over the sink because it leaks when pouring into a cup. Brews really fast. I only need a small amount of coffee to make a full pot and it makes 2 cups. I've had this for 6 months and it still brews nice and hot. That's more than I can say for a lot of other pots, esp. Hamilton Beach makers which notoriously quick working after a few months."
2,Why all the high ratings?,ProsIt makes coffeeConsNO AUTO SHUT OFF.Standard paper filters do not fit. They give instructions on how to fold them.Warnings about how to pour the coffee so the top doesn't fall off (it contains the coffee grinds).
3,Filter Ineffective - Advice Provided,"I was willing to pay the extra (rather exorbitant) price to get the filtered water for taste (filtering DOES take away bitterness if your water is office-type water). I tested it with and without the filter and could not tell a difference. So, why keep this when you can get the same results for $20? Additionally, all of the parts involved are cumbersome for an office environment. It was returned.The coffee is hot enough (I wouldn't want it any hotter). Three stars for average coffee, but poor value.Tip to get filtered water: buy the PUR CR-6000 2 Stage Oval Water Pitcher for $16 from Amazon and get REALLY well filtered water for your $20 coffee maker. Again, filtering the water helps quite a bit with the bitterness."
1,carcinogenic plastic in this coffee maker,"The water tank on the EC-DAC50 Zutto Coffee Maker is made with a Polystyrene plastic, which is carcinogenic."
4,"Beautifully written, draws you right in","Great account of a part of history that is very much neglected. Also a coming-of-age story and a bit of a spy story as well. Grant is an absorbing writer, at her best, in my opinion, when developing a plot around a compelling character at a particularly interesting point in time. This fine book reflects her talent, I did not want the book to end."
3,So bad it's kind of good,"I just watched Hazards on you tube (haven't seen the other). It's really bad, but so over the top bad that it's pretty amusing which is why I gave it three stars. You'd have to enjoy costume dramas to find it funny; if you don't like them, you'll hate this all the more. If this was all unknown actors it probably wouldn't be nearly as laugh inducing. Diana Rigg charging around caverns in period dress is great. Bonham Carter absolutely does the best possible with this role and she and the hero are mercifully given little dialogue- in this movie it helps no end to not have to actually say anything. The other actors are not so lucky, but all seem to be having a pretty good time hamming it up. You can almost see them doubling over with laughter as soon as the director yells cut. They probably had a ball filming this as no one could possibly take it seriously."
2,very disappointing,"Don't buy this package and think that you are getting a bargain. It's not, if you get one or two that are acceptable and are satisfied it's OK but if you expect quality on all, you lose."
2,"Poor production & sadly, poor acting by Helena Bonham Carter","""A Hazard of Hearts"" had great potential but the acting & production were not worth more than a 2-star rating.""Lady Hamilton"" was ridiculous! I wouldn't, couldn't rate it. Terrible!Plus, both these movies had a glitch in/on them. I will try to send it back because it's not a good disc."
4,Good music from a good movie...,"Perfect for the mellow days. Tons of great songs plus the good romantic ones too. If you like the movie, you'll like this CD."
2,This lowered the quality of the film,"There are quite a few romantic comedies out there that have been vastly improved due to their soundtrack. (Take for example, ""Serendipity."") And some soundtracks add the finishing touches to great films. Everytime I hear Harry Connick Jr. and Louis Armstrong used ""When Harry Met Sally,"" it makes the experience even more enjoyable.""Love Actually""'s soundtrack fits in neither of these categories. In such a great movie, where the relationships span over several different ages, they really needed to stick to a more timeless selection of music. Since they jump from the Beach Boys to Maroon 5 to Wyclef Jean (great artists in their own right) the music is so diverse, that it defeats any kind of main theme and ruins the experience. (Yes, they all talk about love, but that's not suitable for a movie like this).If anything, the Billy Mack song is great, purely for its camp value. Other than that, a pretty big disappointment compared to the film itself."
2,No Everlasting Love?,"This is a typical soundtrack for the record industry. The movie studio uses Natalie Cole's Everlasting Love all over the movie trailer, then the record company releases a soundtrack which does not include the one single song used to sell the movie to audiences. Cheap as usual."
1,love actually cd,"I have not bought this CD yet, but I read the reviews that it does not contain the song: Christmas is all around. How could they leave that out? That would have been my main reason to buy it. Now I do not have to waste my money on it."
4,JUST THE SONGS...¿AND THE SOUNDTRACK?,"Is a very good compilation of the songs featured in the movie. Sadly, I was looking for two things:1. The version of All you need is love they played in the film... completely different and much better than the studio version of the CD (really boring, nothing special).2. The original motion picture soundtrack that you will be able to listen better in the DVD menus. Is extremely beautiful!!! But in the CD you will listen only the Glasgow theme. What about the rest? I have like 100 original movie scores and this is a worth having piece of art... Where is it? What can we do to buy it? Maybe not on a CD, but what about on i-tunes or something?"
3,"Love unrequited, actually","I love the movie and the soundtrack, but this CD compilation is an overall disappointment. Two of the songs that were core to the movie -- the comeback Xmas song by the aging rock star, and the song sung by the 12-year-old love interest during the school musical -- are here as ""bonus"" tracks, and the recordings are absolutely horrible!! The young girl (Olivia Olson) is such an exciting surprise talent in the film but her song on the CD sounds like it was recorded in a tin can. And the comeback Xmas song doesn't even sound like the same song or that it's even sung by the same artist (Billy Mack). What a bummer!!! On the plus side, ""Songbird"" by Eva Cassidy is worth the price of the CD, and it's nice to hear an older and wiser Joni Mitchell singing her seminal ""Both Sides Now"" so many years later."
3,Representative Soundtrack,I always wonder why songs appear on a soundtrack that don't appear anywhere in a movie.
4,Great movie..,"So i purchased the album to one of our favorite movies of all time, and I must say I was a little dissapointed.. Maybe I was just over excited about getting the cd, that I built myself up for dissapointment. First, while all the songs that were in the movie were on the cd, I had my heart set on hearing ""All You Need is Love"". In the version on the movie, you hear the trumpets, the guitar, and the flutes at key points in the song.. However, the recoring sounded awful! Very faintly in the background do you hear these instruments, and the ""keyboard beats"" are horrible.. Otis Redding is amazing, as is Joni Mitchell. Olivia Olsen made me forget about Mariah Carey (not a fan). She has an incredible voice!All in all, I did like the cd, and I do recommend it, but beware! A couple of the songs have been recorded badly.."
1,Disappointed,"Saw the movie and the whole time I was watching it I was thinking, ""what a great soundtrack."" Must have been deluded, though. The songs were great - the versions on the soundtrack were not. Got the cd home and was surprised and disappointed in almost song. Shared it with two girlfriends on two separate occasions and they both said the same thing - pitch it. First cd I have thrown out in years."
3,Not as good as UK version...,"this soundtrack is ok.. but the UK version is much better with the group Girls ALoud coveriing The Pointer Sisters' ""Jump""... this new version is great and is worth getting that version only. The Sugababe's song is GREAT!! One of my favs on their new album ""Three"" (def. worth getting) - when will they get another US release?!?! :)"
1,What a disappointment,"If you are looking for the fresh, bouncy, cheerful music that you heard in the movie, this isn't it! Instead of a ""soundtrack"" this is a retread. Even the extras by Billy Mack and Joanna Anderson don't have the life that you heard in the movie. Don't buy this CD!!!!"
5,incredible,"This is one of the best cds to come from the early 90's Dischord roster. Hoover have a sound that is similiar to that of Drive Like Jehu, but more atmospheric with a bit of post-rock bands like Slint. Fred Erskine is one of the best bass players ever in my opinion, completely dominating this cd with his ridiculous basslines. Check out his work with The Crownhate Ruin and June Of 44. the song ""Electrolux"" is like a template for Drive Like Jehu songs like ""Do You Compute"" and ""Luau"" and even some At The Drive-In songs like ""Quarantined"". ""Cable"" is the standout track of the album building with so much tension that the chorus just explodes before going back to a quiet tension. Hoover is one of the most influential bands from early 90's Dischord along with Jawbox and Nation of Ulysses. Get this."
4,Who stole the horns?,"Mad Caddies' new release ""Rock the Plank"" is a very good punk-rock Cd with some ska elements. I like the Cd a lot but it's not what I had expected. Mad Caddies are well known for their awesome horn players, but not on this Cd, it's like somebody stole their horns. This Cd is - GOOD - punk-rock, but it has nothing to do with their previous dixieland-ska Cd's."
1,As if children need to learn more disrespect,"I heard this on KFRG this morning, I have a very healthy sense of humor but as a kid I was in awe of Santa Claus, Policemen, Teachers, the Easter Bunny, and other authority figures who loved children. Kids today can sue their parents if they are unhappy, guns are prevelant in schools, now they are taught to fart on the only person left who will bring them gifts for no other reason than they were ""good"" kids. Perfect. Next year we'll have a song about kids pulling guns on Santa to get the toys they want. Where did the respect go?"
3,Great gloves!,"These gloves are great. I love the grip I get on my firearms with them and they work well preventing slide bite. With my Karabiner 98 Kurz, they work well handling heat that builds here in Arizona.Under the situation of emptying a few mags from an Ak-47... They like to melt. They'll protect you from any serious harm but you'll feel the heat and clearly see some smoke."
4,Good Glove,"I am a little disappointed in the glove because I expected the glove to be a little more thicker. But over all quality and construction of the glove is excellent. The glove has excellent grip and flexibility, seems pretty durable."
5,Christmas present,"Gloves not opened or used yet, but good service and product looks good. Would order again, looks as described on product page."
1,Not impressed.,Mild wind blows right through these gloves. They also run a size smaller than what they should. If you think your a large you should buy a XL. I wouldn't buy again.
5,"Excellent, fitting","I have ordered these gloves once before, but lost them. Both times I have been satisfied with the quality of the gloves. They are tougher than their thin-feeling palm material suggests, and do provide a little warmth. I wouldn't recommend these glove for any long periods out in the cold. They provide good grip and are flexible and manageable. You still maintain a lot of dexterity in your hands with these gloves compared to most.One thing I should note is that if you ever expect to be sliding down any ropes--these are not the gloves you want. I slid down a 12 rope and holes were partially melted in the palms of the gloves. They are still great gloves though, don't get me wrong!"
2,Window XP Conflict,"I purchased a new computer with XP after a house fire and installed Quicken 2002 Home & Business after having been a faithful user since Tobias stopped making MYM. Once installed, my computer would not shut down. Bad computer, I thought, so I bought another with XP. Installed Quicken and same problem. Called local computer whiz to fix problem. No luck. Returned computer and bought another brand, now three different brands of computer with XP. Quicken still corrupted the system. I recommend avoidance of use of this product with XP as neither Quicken nor Microsoft seems to be aware of this problem and no fix has been offered. I am in the process of switching to Money. Good luck, George Hutchison, MD"
5,Wonderfully Insightful,"Mr. Fodor has done an excellent job of exposing the ins and outs of urban planning and growth. His sources are prolific and complete with a well balanced presentation of the challenges of growth and development to any community. For me, this book was a ""suspicions confirmed"" expose' of why it becomes so much more expensive to live in a city. This book is an excellent read with many interesting case studies, charts, analyses, and graphics and I have reviewed it and quoted it often as I have prepared to address our local planning commission and city council. Most of my urban planning and growth questions were addressed in this book."
1,9x13 shattered in the oven,We just had our 9x13 Anchor glass cooking pan shatter in the oven with 2 minutes left in cooking our Thanksgiving stuffing. I literally saw it happen waiting for the stuffing to finish cooking. The recipe was 45 minutes at 400F. I have my doubts on how oven safe these actually are.
5,Great series,Bought it as a christmas gift for a friend...worked beautifully and she watched it 15 times the first week. Now THAT says she liked it!
5,Best Buy!!!!,"I LOVE Bleach!!! This anime is perfect for anyone. Ichigo is so hot! I love the story lines and the action. If you do not own any Bleach, you need to see a doctor!"
3,I love Bleach but it's just not worth it anymore...,"Bleach is my everything. I enjoy buying every box set that comes out, but, I've come to a decision and that's Bleach just isn't worth it anymore. I'm no longer buying the box sets until the prices drop. Goodbye Viz."
4,it's still cheaper then buying individual dvds,I am kinda sad that they are not being released as seasons I miss the boxes and the extra stuff that was in them. Even so I paid 30 bucks for box set 6 and that's alot cheaper then buying individual dvds. I couldn't get 2 volumes for 30 bucks so it's still a good deal and I intend to purchase the next one that comes to bad it doesn't come out till december though.
2,Can't say how good it is,"I bought it to use with my car audio/dvd system, but is not compatible with my Sequoia system. No sound whatsoever."
1,Pop psychology,"Written in easily understandable laymen's terms. However, may be more appropriate and useful for very mild cases of BPD. Those who suffer from moderate to severe forms of borderline pathology would clearly not benefit much from this book.Many of us, who suffer from this illness, could render personal accounts, case histories, along with more insightful,informative, and comprehensive material that would make Miss Jensen look like a little girl playing house."
2,not durable,This mug was ok. It kept my coffee hot as expected. While it was empty it was knocked off of my coffee table (about 2 feet high) and the top shattered so now it keeps nothing hot. I'm the type of person that needs a durable mug to run around with and this was not it.
3,I like this one a lot,Although Flake will probably always be my favorite song of his this is my favorite album.
5,Jack Johnson knows how to chill,I've listened to this CD via borrowing it from friends when they weren't looking. It's one of the best CD's to chill out to. Especially if you pop it in the car and go for a drive with the windows open on a nice summer day :)
3,Must be in the mood...,"There isn't one single fast paced song on this CD. Despite the amazing ""Sitting, Waiting, Wishing"" which is a little faster, the CD really requires a lot of you. You have to be in the mood to hear very mellow stuff, perhaps if you're sad or tired. If you're in a very happy mood and want to jump around, this isn't for you. 3/5 has ups and downs and requires too much of the consumer."
4,"Liked it, but Got Tired of it Quick","No surprises with what you'll get with a Jack Johnson CD. I like his songs but don't get me wrong when I say they all sound the same. The only ones that seem distinguishable are Sexy Plexi and Fortunate Fool. Other than that, the rest are a blur. The CD is good for putting my son to sleep."
3,I hate to say it...,"...Jack didn't do so hot on this album.I can't complain, some of the songs are still good for fans of old Jack Johnson albums, but this one isn't his best...Again, I would buy them in this order:1. On and On2. Brushfire Fairytales3. In Between DreamsHelpful? Click the button!-Chris-"
1,Singularly responsible for the crap music out there,"Jack Johnson is everything that's wrong about singer songwriters these days. His music is for people who think challenging music is some hack sitting on a beach with a beer singing about his lost youth. Ugh. Makes Jimmy Buffet look cutting edge,."
4,Great Mellow Album,"I'm not a popular music fan, although I buy current ""hits"" to just keep abreast of current music. This album showed up on a college student chart as being number one, so what the heck.This is a great mellow album, with only acoustic guitar and voice, and an occasional electric guitar, bass, and drums. The genre is hard to pin down. From an instrument point of view, it must be folk music, but it sounds more like alternative rock type songs, without the rock part.My favorite is ""Better Together""--A nice ditty about how better one is with his girlfriend/wife. This is his big ""hit"" if you can describe it as such, although it charted only 2 weeks in the U.S., but got up to No. 24 in England, where he is more popular than here. Go figure.All in all, this is a nice mellow album which defies categorization. I think you will like it."
4,Just plain nice.,"This album isn't spectacular or mind-blowing, but it's certainly wonderful to listen to. Between Jack's voice and guitar, you can't help but feel peaceful and relaxed and happy - so turn it on during a lazy Sunday and enjoy."
4,"Good, but not On and On","I've listened to this album several times in the last week, and i like it a lot. After much consideration, i decided that it is not as good as On and On. There are a few things i really like about the cd, like the cover, and the song ""Banana Pancakes"" Just today, i actually cooked banana pancakes, and i must say they are ingenius. i recommend this cd and banana pancakes to anyone who likes jack johnson or pancakes."
2,Disappointing,"I'm surprised by the many positive reviews of this album. It simply doesn't compare to Jack's first two. It simply lacks the lyrical and melodic talent so evident in his previous releases. Don't get me wrong -- I'm a big fan. But when considered alongside his previous work, this is disappointing."
2,Not for those who crave edge,"Ok, so this album, though ""relaxing"", does not progress. None of the songs go anywhere. I feel like I should be sitting at a campfire, bobbing my head, but every song sounds the same and now my neck hurts. Not to knock the song writer who is successful, apparently, and able overcome such an adverse fate as a near fatal surfing accident, but it makes me sick inside to think that pop music is continually more tepid. It's probably just the state of pop in general which creates my strong disposition towards this cd / style of music. In any case, I do not like this Sam I Am"
5,Great CD,"This CD is classic Jack Johnson. If you like the single that's been on the radio (Sitting, Waiting, Wishing), you'll like this CD. If you're not familiar with his music, it's got a Dave Matthews feel, but not so whiney."
5,Different perspective as I grew up,"I watched KOR when I was a teenager; in fact, my age is about the same as Kyosuke, Madoka, and Hikaru in the show. Surprisingly, I found myself appreciating the animation, especially this final OAV movie and the original movie, more so as a full grown adult right now with kids. The show is about love and commitments one made in life, whatever that might be. While there might be some silliness in the movie (and the original TV show), those silliness only enable the characters and the audience to ask the question ""what if's"".The only question I have is why Amazon added ""Vol. 1"" after the title; this is a movie, not a OAV series."
2,The Period Ship Series,"When starting to build the San Felipe, I cast around for any books or manuals that included that ship. I found the Period Ship Handbook-3 and was delighted. I purchased it and several other lesser handbooks that I thought might be handy. The Period Ship book was of no particular value in the process of building the model. The book is very visual and has some great pictures, but they essentially provided me with an image of what my ship would look like tomorrow! The miscellaneous handbooks at much lower cost were far more valuable. As nice as the series looks, I honestly believe that they are more like coffee table books than working manuals."
1,.coms or .bombs,"excelent info,but dated,should b updated,many years have passed and new things are here.i worked w mark layton 15 years ago and he was a leader and well informed,daisytek has changed to pfs web now."
4,A tantilizing interplay of the spy game and it's politics,"Sam McCready's job is to engage foreign threats to her majesties realm, but this time the threat is within: an internal enquiry. When confronted with questioning through four courageous episodes of duty, a hidden agenda seems clear. Can insider politics out-match THE DECEIVER?"
2,I prefer the other one,I bought this Friction Belt Loop and also the Belt Ring Hanger which has a different design. The Belt Ring Hanger works better for me because you don't have to take off all the other belts if you want the one furthest away from the opening of the hook. Since I have more belts than my husband I've hung his belts on this one. I recommend the other one if you need this product for belts.
2,Not what I expected,The ring is too thick with the friction cover. Many of my items to be hung can't be fit onto it.
3,MAYBE GOOD FOR A 3 YEAR OLD ...,"Okay let me 1st say that this is smaller then I thought, but then again look at the price compare to the ones you see at ToyRUs and other toy stores. They said this is good for 1 1/2 to 3 year olds. Well how many 2 year olds that you know knows how to steer, I'd think zero. so straight it goes. They do know how to use the gas. Installation is easy and hard. its kinda tricky, but can be done. Lucky they do supply with extra pieces. I did mess up trying to lock the wheels on. Batteries ... 6 D's, not as good as rechargable ones that larger electric cars has. The battery compartment... I do recommend putting in the batteries after you put on the wheels because once you have it on the car its a pain to get onto the compartment. Wish me luck on replacing the batteries. I got this at a bargain price so its okay, but if you are going to pay retail stay away."
3,Why Pam Houston?,"What in God's name does this woman do to get herself included with such great writers as Alice Munro and Annie Proulx? Has the literary world gone mad? After ""Cowboys"" her writing has been complete drivel. Lazy, self-aggrandizing pap. I am really stunned."
4,Great for casual use.,"Great for casual use.I like the flash, but I have read some reviews that say you have to watch how fast you use it, so if you plan to use it a lot at a time do some more research, and make sure it is what you want. If you going to use it once or twice and then wait a few min you will be fine. As I said in the title it is great for casual use."
1,"Visual improvement, BUT","Like other reviewers, I have used quicken for many years, and the 2002 program has a much nicer look and feel. The install went well and was easy. Unfortunatly, the program has some serious bugs, I also found the Net Worth, Balance Sheet, and other ""Balance"" reporting reports completly erroroneous. I too was unwilling to pay 1.95 per minute to assist Intuit in de-bugging their code. I was given the program by my bank and am attempting to get their help in getting Intuit to do something. I am probably going back to 2001. I would not recommend using this product until the bugs are worked out."
3,Just what I needed,Now I know where all those places are that they talk about on NYPD Blue and Law and Order......
5,Great book,"Great book, very detailed and lots of pictures and diagrams. The book is a little out of date with the financial information. But still very useful anyway."
1,Only a moron would carry such a thing,These are for schmucks who want to show off or impersonate police officers. They are illegal in at least one state that I know of. Don't be a mall ninja.
1,"Well-written, but violates candidates' privacy and dignity","I agree with all the other readers who have posted comments here that the book is well-written and very engrossing.But no one else seems to be bothered by the fact that Mr. Fried commits the unconscionable and inexcusable sin of using the real names of the unsuccessful rabbinic candidates. They had every reason to expect that their interviews would be confidential. The Acknowledgments section makes it clear that not all the candidates gave permission for their names to be used, or that Mr. Fried even thought it necessary to ask them.A footnote tells us that the name of a millionaire trouble-maker has been changed. But what does it tell us about the author that he felt no such need to conceal the names of rabbis who have now been embarrassed in print and in public?The book would have lost none of its force if those names had been changed. Shame on the author!"
4,Canadian boots,"The boots are high quality, constructed nicely,super non slip soles. I wish they were a little wider, but I have been able to stretch them to fit."
3,Open Box Item...,"This was a great price, and free shipping clinched the deal. Imagine my surprise when I received a badly damaged box. Opening said box, I realized it was not damaged through shipping. This box had missing flaps inside. Oh yeah, it included ONLY the UPS. None of the accompanying documentation, hardware, nor software was included. The UPS itself was horribly packed. Thank goodness the warehousing staff wadded up that brown packing paper on top of the UPS; that really protected all the styrofoam, which happened to sit atop the UPS. Yes, the UPS was on the bare bottom of the box. Clearly, the product page DID NOT DECLARE this as an open box item. Fairly shameful. That said, the UPS would appear to be new. It bore a product testing receipt from February, 2012.Time will tell. Buyer beware."
3,Who Is The Real Killer?,Movie was great. Kept you guessing who was the killer amongst the people stranded in the mountain storm. Family loved it. We watch it when family come over. Enjoy Native American actors (Adam Beach).
3,A Must Read for Mystery Lovers,"If you like mysteries and enjoy good humor then this is the book you have been looking for. Randy Rawls does a superb job at mixing in humor and small town Texas history in Jakes Burn. Take a humorous and sometimes tragic ride along with Ace the detective and his two mischievous cats, Striker and Sweeper and see if you can solve the mystery before they do. Once I started reading I couldn't put it down. Read it and along with me I am sure you will be sitting on the edge of your seat waiting for the next Ace series mystery to hit the shelves."
1,About put me in a coma,"It's the DVD cover that sold this movie for me. I love puppies and I'm a sucker for animal movies. One of the best being Homeward Bound. But this movie seems more like hours worth of home video footage spliced together with HORRIBLE voice acting and narration put on top of it. The people that voiced theses characters are among the worst I have ever heard. Some of the accents these people came up with were just terrible. It would be much more enjoyable watching this movie on MUTE! But even then it's not very good. The camera work is very amateurish. The picture is often out of focus and they don't even do a good job at keeping the dogs on screen all the time.This movie is good for ages 2 and under. For everybody else, watch a better movie or buy a dog calendar."
5,Awesome!,"If you love puppies, country life and/or the amazing natural abilities of Border Collies, you'll love this movie. A cute story enjoyed by little ones to my father who is in his 70's and an avid cattle man. I bought several movies for Christmas and everyone loved them - even my daycare provider's son who is 4 and never been around ranch life!Enjoyment for the whole family - we need more like these!"
4,Great card,"I bought this card years ago from a seller and by years I mean, 5. This card has never given me problems but I will admit the write speed is a little slow so that means I've missed some good pictures because it was writing to the card but still, at the price I paid it's been a great choice! I've been using this in my 4MP Kodak C310 which is old now. I'm going to now use it for short casual trips for my new Canon Powershot SD1000."
4,Mi Pocket PC lee 488MB no 512MB,Esta tarjeta de memoria trabaja como lo publicitado en mi HP IPAQ 3715.Mi unica queja es que lee 488MB y no los 512MB que dice tener. Por lo demas exelente trabajo. En español es mejor.
2,somewhat entertaining but highly dissapointing,"It was an easy read which kept me temporarily occupied but I soon grew bored, looking foward to the end. If you felt that William S. Burroughs' ""Junkie"" was a wonderful book, it will leave you highly disappointed. Re-reading ""Junkie"" would be much more worth while."
3,Decent (3.5 stars)...,"This CD is alright, a little inconsistent. The mixing is standard, nothing that blows me away like say the DJ skills of Doc Martin, Mark Farina, Jeno, DJ Dan. D1 is nice, D2 is a lil chuggy. It's an OK release, nothing to write home about."
3,Big disappointment in its Web integration,"I recently moved to Mac OS X from Windows 2000. This is one of my first Mac OS X application. First, it's a disappointment that this is not Cocoa-based. Instead its Carbon-based and hence, the dialog looks poor on Mac OS X especially when you view it at very high resolution screen. The fonts are just so tiny. And worse, there is no way you can change the font for the registry.I use online banking a lot and its online banking is ok if you're connecting to Quicken server or if your bank has Quicken support. However, for those bank that use Web interface, the integration is terrible. You'd have to use your browser to download the QFX file manually and then import the transaction that way. It's more integrated in Windows."
2,Not worth the upgrade,"I upgraded from 2000 and there is not much that has changed. The same problems are still there and they added some new ones. The newest annoyance is that you can only use one rebate- either the upgrade rebate OR the turbo-tax rebate, so if you already own quicken there is no incentive to purchase turbotax, especially since most reviews say Taxcut is the better program. In summary, if you already own a version of quicken- keep using it, this version doesn't add much and certainly isn't worth the upgrade."
1,Stay with MS money -- this thing is a beast,"I almost couldn't believe that quality control let this out of the door at Intuit. We bought two new OS X machines and are switching from Win 2K. Quicken seemed logical to switch to on the Mac. I heavily use MS Money 2001 on the PC and knew the switch would be easy.This software has so many obvious bugs it's terrible -- dates do not work properly, you can't schedule bills for anything except 2020 !! (?), the columns aren't movable so that when you view a loan the column cuts off the year for the payment listing.I tried very very hard to switch, investing approximately 25+ hours over the past week. I am sending this product back to Intuit for a refund. I'll be buying virtual PC and running Money.Perhaps if you use your financial program to simply keep a check register it would be O.K.Don't waste your cash."
5,A Must Have for Track Fans,"I was inspired to write this because another reviewer gave this magazine a zero rating because he hadn't received his subscription yet. I can understand his frustration, but it has nothing to do with the magazine.I've subscribed to Track and Field News for years and it is excellent. If you are a fan of the sport I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir as you probably subscribe to it already. I can't imagine someone being a fan and not subscribing to this magazine.So for me it has it all: Great photography, interesting articles, detailed event reporting, schedules of future events, statistics regarding records and performances.If you're not a track fan this is not for you; if you are this is a must have."
5,I found what I was seeking,"I am a newly practicing Christian, having found myself at a low point in my life. I was looking for guidance on delving deeper into a relationship with God and this book has given me new life. It is a remarkable book on how to deepen, strenghten, and improve your connection to God. I would highly recommend it. I take my time reading the chapters and slowly read the prayers. After praying along with the book, I am closer to God and I include my own ""conversations"" (prayers) :)Again, highly recommended."
5,A Must Read for Any Woman!,This book is amazing and Heaven sent! I went to the bookstore searching for something and I was not sure what. I was looking for guidance. I came across it and skimmed through to realize it was what I wanted and needed. I have had so many questions and have longed for a deeper spiritual life with only confusion on how to achieve that. This book has opened my eyes and my heart and changed my life. It is easy to read and easy to understand. Stormie writes in such a way that you feel as if she wrote the book for you.I highly recommend it! I will be buying it for all the women in my life when I think it will speak to them most because I want to share with them the same experience that I have enjoyed.
4,Good product,"Everythiing as would be expected with a new opener. Only short coming was the lack of wire staples. Only a few were supplied, not enough to properly restrain the many wires."
2,Looks ok but the performance is sub par....,"Got these shoes on sale on Amazon. First, the sizes are for narrow feet. If you are a wide size like me, then you'll either have to look elsewhere or have your shoes stretched, which I did. After stretching and ordering them a size larger, I still need to use corn pad to prevent corns because of the pain. I prep my shoes since I walk about 3 miles a day using order sprays and powders. Surprisingly, they started to stink after 3 days use despite the precautions. They must be using recycled or subpar material. The smell persist despite sprays, powders, liners, freebreeze... The stitching on the front toe part started showing white material forcing me to use polish to keep them looking good. After three months, they do hold up somewhat but I will not purchase another pair. My old Shaqs were superior to these Reebok and cost much less."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF GOOD FILM!,"This has to be one of the most god awful excuses for a movie I have seen in my entire life.The jabronies who created Beavis&Butthead invented two of the biggest morons ever to grace,or should I say scar god's green earth.Mike Judge is messed up in the head if he created a film like that.GROW UP MIKE!"
3,funny stuff,"I like Beavis and Butthead. But not for four or five stars. Let's face it, this was probably the best the movie could be. Yeah Yeah. The Cornholio stuff is worth the price."
5,Absolutely Hilarious!,"Before I saw this movie, I only knew of B&B's simple existence, I'd never seen any of the TV shows and I wasn't sure whether I wanted to see the film. After I came out of the cinema I was laughing so hard I split my sides! This has to been the best comedy of 1996! It's very crude, very juvenile, very, very funny, to say the least as our imfamous duo end up trekking across America in search of their life giving TV and to try and score. Plus there'e a host of neat big name stars to listen out for. Bruce Willis and Demi Moore as the bad guys, Robert Stack as the tough FBI veteran. And Bill Clinton as himself! Not for the parents!"
4,What is that? Must be them dang buzzardhawks,"That title was from the always hilarious Anderson. What can you say about Beavis and Butthead that hasn't been said already? When you pop in Beavis and Butthead you just know what to expect. You will get to see some of the funniest brainless humor ever created, which is why I love it so much. They are some of the most simple yet most memorable cartoon characters ever created. Whenever I need a good laugh I don't need to think about, Beavis and Butthead is always the obvious choice."
3,"Good movie, I have seen better episodes","This is one of my favorite movies of all time, since it is Beavis and Butthead. If you are a fan of Beavis and Butthead, order this DVD right now. It will bring you an hour and a half of laughs. 10 years later, when you are watching the DVD, you will laughing hysterically. The quality on the DVD is very good by the way."
2,Bummed Out,"As much as I enjoy watching Beavis & Butthead..I was rather annoyed as well as disappointed to find..that ALL of the music clips, wherethese two would comment on the song, artist what have you..were notin these DVD reproductions. Oh well. .. guess I'll know better next time."
1,show is much better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i think this movie should be banned. It is the worst movie of all time. I am the biggest Beavis a Butthead fan alive, but no a fan of this crappy movie. Plot sucks, dvd sucks, crappy, no special features & it's not worth buying. I just bought the season dvds on eBAY. I have to sink that low for those idiots. I hate this movie!"
5,"If you don't like Beavis & Butthead, DON'T buy this film!!!","But if you do, you'll LOVE this one! The boys travel the length & breadth of America in an effort to better understand what this great land of ours is all about... ah, who am I kidding? These two dillweeds are as stupid as they come, but their adventures along the way are hilarious!"
1,However others find this book even readable is beyond me,"Having thought Amityville was absolutely horrid, I read Anson's other attempt with an open mind: How could anything be worse than that first novel? Little did I know, however, the extremes of bad writing which the author is able to delve into. The characters are far worse than those of even a typical supermarket-checkout-stand-paperback novel: one-dimensional, boring, and at times, completely annoying. The plot moves along like a slug through table salt, and it's as painful to read as it is to watch that slug turn into a mound of sludge. The only good parts of the novel are those in which the pieces are fitted together: the coin, the wood in the house... And the minister/brother and satanist kids are certainly a quaint touch."
3,Disasters galore,"We in America have a short view of things. This is especially true of disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes and the like. Disasters like this happen periodically in time, yet each new one brings tales of woe and predictions of gloom. As such, it is good to have a nice review of the various calamities to have hit mankind. This book does this; it covers both natural disasters such as Pompeii and the San Francisco earthquake, and man-made disasters such as the Titanic. The book is nicely illustrated, with a text accessible by anyone with a high school education and higher."
1,Where's the editor?,The grammer is so horrible that it makes Meyer's Twilight Saga seem good. The plot was very hackneyed and incoherant that it was just plan awful. While it could have been a decent plot if it wasn't for the grammer; I don't think anything would have done anything to improve the quality of this fine piece of literature.
1,Nikki 'The Goth' Paccione,"I read the first few pages and couldn't take it anymore. I do, however, recommend this work for anyone feeling really down, for nothing can make you laugh as much as a small dose of this waffle.My family and I still have jokes about 'waking thoughts', and it raises the mood of the entire house to partake of small (very small) close readings of this mess that Nikki likes to call writing...Thanks for the entertainment, Nikki!Seriously, if you don't feel like scraping your eyes out with heated spoons, DON'T read this stuff."
1,Sad I had to give this even one star.,"The first three lines caused a migraine. What is this? Six year olds write better than this! I would yawn less at ""The dog ran. He likes bones. He is my friend."" Trust me, don't waste your time, effort or money on this drivel."
1,Why buy when you can read for free?,"Google the table of contents, and you'll find virtually every story in this dreadful amalgamation of sequential non-sequitors somewhere online. Then again, don't and save yourself the eyestrain and nausea. Spare yourself the horror of first lines that not even the Bulwer-Lytton contest judges could stomach. Avoid the incomprehensible syntax, the superfluous verbiage, the repetitive and redundent tautologies that constitute the endless and pointless drivel that is this book. If someone gives it to you as a present, sever all contact with that person, regardless of the closeness of your former relationship, for your presenter obviously wishes you ill."
4,A Husband and Wife Team,"Mickey is divorced, has a young son and runs a flower shop. Fred is getting married soon.But fate throws them together and everything changes.Up to their mid-teens, Mickey and Fred lived next door to each other. They were the best of friends - knew everything about each other. They were getting closer every day and knew their lives would be spent together.But all that changed when with no warning, Fred and his mother disappeared and Mickey was left without a word.Written by a husband and wife and told in alternating chapters, this is a good book on friendship, love and second chances."
4,an excellent introduction to irish history,"I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in irish history. it is an excellent first read on the subject and takes a fair, thorough and well thought out approach to the many difficult issues in irish history. If you are already familar with irish history you will not find any new information here but for the begininer it is excellent."
4,Great workout! I enjoyed it!,I was looking for a good workout that I can do in the morning before work. I really enjoyed this one because it explains the moves well so that I didn't get totally lost. I think this is a great beginners video and fun too!
3,"A light workout, minus the ""art"" of bellydancing","If you've never seen another bellydance video, this would be a useful introduction. I have enjoyed many Kathy Smith videos over the years, and this fits in with her style. She always seems to have her pulse on the latest trends and she has found a way to turn bellydancing into a ""workout"" format. Every move is broken down into individual steps, and it is very slow-paced. The end result is not very artistically appealing. If you are interested in the art of bellydancing, this video would be a tremendous disappointment. The music is very annoying, with a strong emphasis on the beat so you can follow ""on tempo."""
2,Not worth the time it takes to watch,"Kathy Smith does not know enough about belly dancing to teach it. The most helpful part of the DVD is the tutorial that explains what you should be doing with your body when doing some moves. This part of the DVD is not taught by Kathy, but by an experience dancer. If the whole DVD were that detailed it would be 5 stars. I also feel that there was no enough attention give to keeping proper posture while dancing in order to prevent back injury."
4,Out of context,"Bashing this record just for the prog rock aversion vision, is just plain prejudice, because by now you probably know what you're getting into when buying this record, virtuosity, experimentation, jamming.. etc.That being said, if you have a short attention span, it's obvious you won't like this record, It would be like bahing a ramones record just because there a no guitar solos, or complex song structures. Just listen to the record in the proper context, We all know Omar is one selfish musician, but he has made a really interesnting effort nevertheless."
3,Some weird and crazy stuff,"Much of the Mars Volta's new CD sounds as if it was recorded ON Mars. That's not always a bad thing. I'm a fan of controlled wildness like John Zorn or Flaming Lips, and some of the adventurous spirit of the music on Frances appeals to me in that same way. It certainly is a head trip. However, I like a little melody with my weirdness, and there's not enough of that on this CD. For all of those who voted ""5 stars"" for this, I wonder if they will really be playing the CD on ""repeat,"" singing along with the songs, or having the tunes run in their heads. Not likely, because there aren't that many actual tunes on Frances the Mute. There are a lot more sound effects, samples, electronic manipulations, etc. than actual melodies. This music was interesting to listen to, and I'm sure it will be a wild ride in concert. But as far as actual SONGS, the CD falls short."
5,More than,"This album is bound to get very low reviews by very very many people. For one reaon: The Widow made it to the radio-waves and EMTV-waves. Which is cool and all, but very many people will be expecting an EMTV type of album, howeverIt holds much more substance than that."
5,Frances The Mute,"Is the best sequel to De-Loused the Mars Volta could make, it was the one album that i have ever gone out on the day it came out to purchase, and @ about $8 it was totaly worth it! if you are thinking about getting it go and spent the little money that it costs to have true music...laters"
5,hey those of you wanting deloused volume 2,"this is not it, so don't give it a crappy review just because it doesn't sound exactly like deloused. first of all the band has said many times that they want to PROGRESS with their music, not stay in the same plac. So.. if you want to listen to a band pump out the same cd, with a different title, every year or so, go listen to green day because this is not for you. That said this cd is amazing !!! cygnus and casandra are the major highlights while miranda and L'via are right up there.And every one needs to get their hands on the decoder song which is freakin awesome, i wish it would have come in a package with the cd because everyone needs to hear this one."
5,Frances-the navel stream overfloods!,"Frances the mute comes off after a strong De-Loused in the comatorium released before it. It is an exhilarating experience to sit and listen to its depth, its swaying emotions. You become the story, you live it,and you end it. It isn't anything you have ever experienced before,and you never will experience anything else like it again"
2,Didn't really stick,"I know I read it... but it didn't really stick. She's got a lot of cute acronyms she uses for everything. They get a little tediuos when you read the whole book and try to remember them. ""Feel the Fear and do it Anyway"" is a MUCH better book."
3,Just ok,"This book is basically just giving you a bunch of little tips to help you raise your confidence. Each chapter has a new acronym and it kind of defeats the whole purpose because it's impossible to remember all of them. It's also difficult to implement the ideas in your life because you are getting so many tips, how are you supposed to remember them when it comes to every day life? This book was ok if you are looking for a book on tips, but I was expecting it to be better based on all the 5 star reviews."
2,Gentle Reminders,"This book has 30 days informing the reader on how to improve life one step at a time over a month. Guaranteed just trying some of these ideas does work, however, there is nothing new in this book that hasn't been written before. It is just said in another way. If this is what it takes to get people going, then the author has succeeded! For me however, i wanted to have an understanding of the areas in my life that i wanted to improve, but needed to understand them first. This understanding has been satisfied by reading different books. The author in mind is actually made reference to in this book."
5,Highly Recommended,Ginsberg's novel is a wonderfully entertaining mystery set in the literary world. The twists and turns in the life of beleaguered agent assistant Angel Robinson are well crafted and kept me absorbed late into the night. Ginsberg's voice is highly engaging; it pulled me ever more deeply into the story and kept me happily turning pages right up to the end.
3,Used for Casino Night,"I used this for a casino night, the wheel is great, but the felt is very, very small. I would order a bigger felt to go with it but it spun great!"
5,I love this shampoo!,"I am almost done with my first bottle of Rusk P.M and J. Color shampoo. I love the smell. My color seems to be lasting longer without fading. It cleans and protects. I am questioning if I even need a conditioner when using this because my hair is soft and tangle free. (my hair is short, thick and coarse)"
5,Great music!,"I love this CD! I especially like Show Me Your Tattoo! Anytime I need a lift, I just put this one in and enjoy! Don't get me wrong though, I like each and every song on this CD very much!"
5,Great movie,My granddaughter loved the movie i had on VHS so i decided to buy it for heron DVD. Great price and she was so surprised she jumped up and down.
3,The Best is Tanya Roberts,"I only buy this movie by the presence of the beautiful Roberts,her face and curves and just perfect,the other the scenary of Africa and the wild animals.I must say that this Dvd version dissapointed me a lot;I thought of great extras but instead there's only film trailers of another movies from the studio and also the sound is in Dolby Surround Stereo instead of 5.1A good entertainment."
5,A Book Worth Having,"Robert Frank's book ""The Americans"" presents a stunningly visual portrayal of the 1950's culture and the times we lived in. Frank's photographs brought back strong memories of people and places I remember. I saw his anniversary exhibit in New York and felt the book really captured his photographs. These are strong pictures, ones you'll remember. I recommend this book to all--not just photography lovers, but to anyone who wants to see a slice of American life gone by."
1,"Good for knives other than from ""fine cutlery"" lines.","Sabatier 10-slot Wood Knife Block is not for you if you own a quality French-made collection of fine Sabatier knives from their Provence or Grand Chef series. First of all the block is not compatible with high-end lines of knives because the slots for knives are not wide (thick) enough for blades to fit in. Secondly, there is no way this block could ever be sold for anything close to its list price. The [price] price is more like the correct &#65533;regular&#65533; price for this item. The quality of this block made out of mismatched by color and grain &#65533;two-by-four&#65533; pieces of pine does not justify a list price higher than ten dollars. I will be returning this item back to Amazon because block&#65533;s quality is not up to par for Sabatier name it carries. My new out of the box block has dents and scratches on its surface; even Sabatier logo on the front is crooked."
5,learning Hawaiin,I recently found an old friend I used to see 40 years ago. He had moved back to Hawii. I'm having fun learning his language. He sends me e-mails in Hawaiian and I translate them now...fun.
5,Great Resource,"This book offers a reality check for our culture on why we are here and our purpose for living. I have used the book for a sermon series to challenge us as Christians, not to buy into the religion offered by our world today. It helps us examine or faith and gives answers on how to respond to persons caught up in life under the sun."
2,I agree with the previous review; incorrect title for content,"I couldn't finish reading the book because it got boring and fell into stressing how IMPORTANT it is to leave a legacy. But in terms of addressing the *how* the book completely fell short to its promise. Or if author tried to do that, somehow the examples given didn't really get me excited or inspired enough to really set my own intentions around WHAT KIND of LEGACY/HERITAGE to leave.I happen to live in a non-American, non-suburban area - where everything is super fast-paced and very urban. The suggestions in the book felt a bit outdated and irrelevant to my current living style. I wish I'd thumbed through the book at a library and just photocopied relevant stories for myself if it were possible."
2,very very small,this item smells great but its like 1 inch by 2 inches and 1/4 an inch thick its very small very small i dont think its worth the money
2,Mini of mini's. Too small for the price.,"This bar of soap was mini size. I bought it as a gift but was ashamed to give it because it was so tiny, like a sample from a motel room. It's cost was far too muchfor the sample size."
2,mistral sopa,"i gave this product a rating of 2 stars because my dissatisfaction is mostly my fault. the item does state ""travel soap"" and plainly reads 50g, but imagine my surprise to find that it measured only 2-7/16""w x 1-5/8""h, and i paid $3.50 for it - on sale. the soap smells beautifully like gardenias and shipping it back would only cost me more,so i kept them. buyer beware and aware...learned my lesson."
2,Something's missing,Received the product on time but it sure would have been nice if it would have included the spray nozzle like it showed in the picture. I guess I'll have to find something to fit the bottle so I can use it.
4,Good fun for Marvel fans and decent game overall,"Being able to play your favorite Marvel characters and use trademark special moves has lots to geek out about. A pretty long story line can keep the game interesting for a good while too. Playing with your friends over Xbox live gives relief from AI frustrations and the solo missions in the simulator let each hero show case their stuff. My largest complaint is camera view that corrals the team around like a bunch of sheep. It's hard to make out exactly what's going on at times from clutter and to truly appreciate what the characters are doing. Still, an endurable annoyance given the fun with cheesy dialog and villain chest pounding."
4,Heavy and technical,"The drums and guitar are the rythme while the bass is the melody, which is a nice change. Very tight, and powerful. They dont try to be pretty or catchy, or woo the ladys. They dont hold anything back. Like 'Drive like jehu,' 'Kerosene 454,' and early 'Don Caballero,' they blow the roof of your house, and the windows out of your car! This album opens strong and ends stronger. The more I listen to it the more I like it.Also check out 'Hoover' for the bands earlier project. And I believe that 'The radio flyer' features at least one of them."
5,"Love, love, love it!!!","I was a bit apprehensive at first, especially after reading some of the previous reviews, but I took a chance since people stated that Amazon & the manufacture were very helpful in resolving any issues that arouse. Thankfully I did not have any delivery issues, box was in great condition, and I thoroughly inspected it before the delivery guy left. My only complaint would be the directions (they are horrible) you have to pay close attention to the details of the illustrations (no words, just pictures). Take your time, do not rush, and make sure you place the `cams' in as pictured so you do not run into any broken ones. My husband and I put it together in about 2 hours, give or take, and it is wonderful!! As other reviews have said, there is NO PARTICAL BOARD; it is SOLID WOOD and heavy! I would totally recommend purchasing this hall tree."
1,Johnny doesn't come marching home,"I would love to write a nice review but seeing as I ordered this cd back in may and have yet to receive it, it would be very hard to do so. I just want my F***ing cd. Its coming up on 3 months sinced ordered, and they continue not ship."
5,Highly recommended,"I have about 5 years of salsa dance experience, but I've never formally taken any bachata classes. I've just never heard of anyone teaching it in my area of the globe. These DVDs have been great for me to expand my bachata steps. (I've only really known the side to side basic and turning side to side.) I really recommend these DVDs.The price might seem like a lot but considering the fact that a single 45 minute private dance lesson goes for $85 at a dance school, these DVDs are sooo worth it.The production quality is excellent. Instructions are clear for both leaders and followers. The instructors demonstrate the moves from different angles so you can see what going on with the arms and legs from the other viewpoint. Not only do they teach dance moves, but also introduce some bachata history and tips on proper etiquette at dance clubs. (For example, don't refuse a dance with someone, and then accept to dance with a different person during the same song!)"
4,4.5 Stars....,"Such an amazing album. This was my first LLCrew CD. Trust me, you will NOT be disappointed. So many clean tracks. I'm really in love with this CD. Only a few songs have beats that I'm not feeling, but I listen to them regardless, simply for their lyrical content. Just cop this album. You'll be glad you did."
4,If you like Prog then you will not be disappointed,"Fisrt of all I listened to this three different times, in the car, at home on headphones and on my surround system before I wanted to review this CD. I read all the reviews and have the previous 2 releases and now I can honestly say that this is really good. If you want details read the other posts cause I don't want to waste you time repeating what others have said.Keeping it simple this is a prog lovers delight and in 2006 we do not get enough of this type of music to be too picky. If you are concerned about the wow factor there is plenty here to keep you inteested and impressed. So if you are on the fence about this one, please buy it, for 15 bucks it definatly worth the price of a less than half a tank of gas!"
2,Dissapointment,"As far as the music and playing, I didn't find anything inspiring or beyond ordinary (although, I've only listened twice)with the material. Essentially, kind of boring all in all. The lead singer sounds like Al Stewart ('Year of the Cat' fame), but seems to go in and out of pitch/tune at times (unlike Stewart). His voice is distracting at time and seems to clash with the instrumentation (well, in my opinion anyways). The anti-war lyrics seemed juvenile as well as the overall late '60s hippy-ish message. One characteristic about prog rock I've always liked was that themes center around science, fantasy, science fiction, and etheral subjects, not this political bull. It's really anoying on this CD. I liked the first Tangent CD better (although didn't like lead singer's voice) and I haven't heard the second. It appears as if Roine Stolt is not in this most current version of Tangent"
1,This Mat is Dreadful,To say that this mat is very slippery is an understatement. It is basically unuseable! I wound up throwing it aside the first time I tried it out. A complete waste of money.
1,push button on this machine is not reliable,"I was very excited to have this little chopper in my kitchen and it worked great for about 3 months until the button which starts the chopper stopped working. Kitchenaid replaced the chopper for me with no trouble at all but, 8 months later, the button on my replacement chopper has also stopped working. I have only used the chopper a handful of times and when it works, it's great! Unfortunately, it doesn't always work. I am going to try to return this one and buy another brand."
3,Kitchen Aid Food Chopper,"I bought this to replace my current chopper becuase I liked the shape of the bowl more so than what I had. But, I must say that this product does not meet my expectations. I thought the shape of the bowl would improve the end product (whipped garlic sauce) but in fact it made little difference.Nonetheless, it works fine; just no better than others such as my prior which is a cuisinart."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I bought the KitchenAid Chef Chopper based on the stand mixer which I love. After average use or less the chopper no longer chops!! The blades do not turn if there is anything denser than water in the bowl. When I contacted the company I was basically told that it was more expensive to fix it than buy a new one, so they offered a new one at a reduced price (not reduced enough IMHO). I was really disappointed that KitchenAid would sell an appliance that they do not believe is worth fixing!! Save your money and do not buy this one."
2,Broke,I must say I really enjoyed this chopper until it broke at almost a year old. This is the most expensive chopper I have owned and it lasted the least amount of time. It had the audacity to break during Thanksgiving while I was making my holiday meal. I had to pull out the old standby Wustoff chef knife.
1,"Loud, shrill, hard to clean","I got one of these as a wedding present a few years ago. It was my very first food processor, and I hate it.The processor is very loud. It produces a high-pitched squeal that from the next room (or apartment) sounds like a woman screaming. When I first started using it, my neighbors got kind of cold toward my husband. Apparently, they thought the food processor was me screaming. I stopped using it when they were home.The processor is also hard to clean. You have to dismantle everything, and dirty water tends to accumulate beneath the handle, where the little lever hits the button (it's hard to explain).My anniversary is in October. I plan to celebrate with a new food processor."
2,Mincing Machine,"If you want to mince onion this machine is just fine, however, chopping is outside of its range.Nice little machine but it needs some more blades and a slicer to be useful."
2,An expensive so-so chopper,"I owned a Little Oscar for years and loved it. My friend gave me this Kitchenaid a year ago and it doesn't chop anything in consistant pieces. I've chopped nuts, celery, onions, carrots, etc with every variety of chop produced...from mush to totally unchopped pieces, all in one bowl. This chopper is just not worth the $40. price tag! Not only that, but I put the plastic cup in the microwave and a small metal piec in the handle (I didn't notice), melted the handle so the lid won't lock on the bowl. I have been unable to purchase a replacement bowl, even from Kitchenaide themselves."
5,RED IS GOOD !!!,"I am familar with kitchenaid products, have quite a few of them. Kitchenaid kfc3100er red chef's chopper mini food processor, 3cup. This is an excellent processor in a small size the bigger ones are also good. But at times smaller is better. This fits job!! Shipped and delivered on time. Good price also!!"
1,"If you like your liquids all over the place, this one is for you. :)","Just used this to make pasta sauce. Big mistake. The holes in the lid, for adding dry and wet item, also allow your food to go flying!Yes, I could put my hand over it, but the point is, it's a silly design.Back it goes."
1,Bad design,"It was working just fine at first when new. My wife was using it a lot blending food for the baby, making soups and purees. Then she placed it in the cabinet for a few months. Just the other day she took it out and it just wouldn't turn on anymore. I thought maybe it's because it wasn't used for a while. I am a Design Engineer and I took a good look at what could be the problem. The cover latch mechanism does not make contact with the small side button. The plastic twist and turn cover mechanism wears out over time. It's very surprising to us because it wasn't even used lately.In order for it to work you would have to use some sharp object like a knife and poke the button. But it's pointless because even though the blades will turn on but the cover is off and as result - you can't blend no food. We threw it in a garbage because I couldn't fix it."
1,Mine also stopped working,"After less than about 10 uses the safety mechanism no longer engages. The little peg doesn't go far enough into the hole to get it to turn on, if you know what I mean. It chopped nice, but the safety is poorly designed. I wouldn't recommend until they fix it."
5,Love it.,"As a beginner, it gives me a great workout. I know it will be useful as I advance for there are different workout variations and segments. It is awesome. It was a little confusing and hard to keep up with the moves at first, but once you do it a few times and are in tune with her cues, it is great."
2,Kathy Smith's Power Step Workout,"While I find Kathy's cuing and instruction to be pretty good, I find this tape monotonous. The music hardly varies on the three aerobic workouts. The setting in a warehouse with everyone in black, is just dark! !You will sweat;the first two numbers are fairly easy to follow, the third gets more difficult with turns which are not easy to accomplish when trying to watch a video. Not a tape I look forward to doing very often!"
4,An excellent product,"As a long-term quicken user, I am pleased with this product. It has improved reports and graphics and still has the capability to track stocks and mutual funds. The cash flow report is always the most important part of quicken because it allows the user to track personal finances.One small bug has always botherered me, however. For retirement accounts containing mutual funds, quicken adds all distributions to the account holder's basis. This is inconsistent with IRS practice, which is that the distributions are not taxed and therefore are not added to the shareholder's basis. This bug leads to some inaccurate gain and loss results for retiremment accounts."
5,funny sign,This is a very nice sign. I love the saying on it. I would only wish that they included suction cups with it for putting it on glass but it is a very good quality sign.
4,nice fragrance,"face and body mist is hard to find, so i was glad to locate this product. reasonably priced, arrived promptly."
5,great book,This book is great and well written help you understand everything in simple terms and everyone should read to help your financial future.
5,awesome music!!!,Love the style of the music on this cd. Especially love the songs by the Guy Kraines trio. It is so heartfelt. A unique set of songs!!
2,Does not help much,"If you're already ready for consulting, then you'll do well on case interviews anyways. You do not need to read this book. It is just commong sense. And those who are not sure if they are ready for consulting jobs, this book will not teach you how to think about the questions. It will only give you some examples which you will never be asked."
5,Good music for anyone who can appreciate it,"This isn't actually a book. It is a beautifully-crafted CD by a wonderful no-longer-together band called the Housemartins. I recommend it to anyone who knows and loves the Beautiful South or bands like Trash Can Sinatras, Stephen Duffy, Barenaked Ladies, etc. London 0/Hull 4 is the first disc by this brilliant group. Buy it today!! END"
1,Pond Algae control,This product is used in a small water fountain. The fountain bottom is covered with algae. Obviously this product is not working. Have increased the amount used and it still doesn't prevent the algae. NOT happy with this performance
1,"Dang, this movie is baaad!","Ok, I should have rented this movie from the library first before wasting my money on this stink burger...The sub was too big and there was too much walking space, they ripped off too many scenes from Crimson Tide and Hunt for the Red October which were far better movies then this one. I strongly recomend you buy something else like Crimson Tide or Das Boot if you like submarine movies."
3,Doesn't remember where you left off,"Yeah, it's really a bummer that this player always starts back up at track 1 after you turn it off! Plus when you put it in ""pause"", it automatically turns off after a few seconds, so there you are back at track 1 again. The display is numbers only, no song names. But it's a bottom-end mp3 player, what do you expect."
4,About the pen,"It's a great blender pen. It arrived later than they said it would, but I think it was because of the holidays. The pen itself works. I got no complaints."
5,Best Guide to Grammatical Problems I've Read,"If you're serious about German, this is the book that will answer all of your questions. Great format; it feels like a dictionary instead of a textbook, which I like. I bought it in Hamburg, lost it, and have bought it again from Amazon. It's worth it. It's that good."
5,Like Grandma Used to Make,If you're looking for a good gift to give - for any occasion - you found the perfect thing. This cookbook has great recipes. Easy ones and then the more challenging ones (souffles)! It's the best. And you don't have to pay full price. When I bought it I immediately made 3-4 things. Everything was a hit. Don't think you could be disappointed with the recipes if you get one!
2,Robs your Wallet,"This game has SO few songs, it's amazing that Activision charges full price for this product. The whole track list could be sold as a song pack for the 360 version of Guitar Hero. I was really disappointed."
2,"Geat Idea, Poor Execution - Don't bother.","This game is a great idea and one that I've been looking forward to, however the actual execution of the game is really poor. I find that in most cases the music doesn't match the note-target thingys. No, I'm not talking about the abundant music-sync issues, I'm talking about the music not matching the targets you have to hit - so much so that for me, the game is totally not enjoyable. I know the songs in the game, intimately, and it's really off. Red Octane probably knows this and didn't really want to advertise this disgrace tot he product line.Overall very un-enjoyable way to spend a few hours (not to mention $). It's a shame. Perhaps Red Octane should produce a 'Folk Song Hero' or maybe a 'Disco Hero', it couldn't be any worse."
2,Not worth it.,"What could have been an amazing game now just appears to be a filler while they perfect Guitar Hero III.Despite the poor play list (check it out, even hard core 80's fans don't even recognize half the songs), this game could have been worth the money if it would have had the content of other guitar hero games, but it didn't. It only had a portion of the characters from Guitar Hero II, no unlockable songs, and only one unlockable character. The lack of unlockable songs is a huge dissappointment, as it leaves you paying the same price of Guitar Hero II (game only) but only having half the content. Also, with only one character to unlock and no songs, there is no motivation to strive to get the five stars on every song."
2,Short-lived Guitar Hero Fun,"Let's keep it brief. I don't think the producers need to make this game any differently. The classic concept is well-maintained; guitar hero: encore or any following sequels do not need to change the layout of the game. However, for those who ""Want to Rock"", this game will be a disappointment.One huge problem. VERY short songlist + NO bonus tracks = poor game execution. The game series will always be fun, but it's ridiculously short-lived in this paticular installment. Words of advice?...Save your money. Wait for Guitar Hero III (out now). If you have to play GH: Encore, rent it or go to a friend's house who already has it- you could probably knock out one difficulty mode easily in a night.Then again, if you're a diehard gamer who needs to complete the collection, I empathize with you- by all means, purchase it. But for the rest of you... well you get the drift."
3,Not worth the money...,"After hearing about GH does the 80's I couldn't wait for it's release, but man what a letdown it was. Only 30 songs, some of which I have never heard of, for the same price as 40. Like others have said GH80's is easier than the other GH's. I even got 5 stars on a hard song (I've only barely made it through the hard songs on GH2) so it has to be less difficult. If I could do it again I wouldn't have spent 50 bucks on this lame excuse for a follow up. If they had priced it according to what you get it would be another story, but right now I'm feeling like I got screwed."
3,It's The Same Thing,I couldn't wait for rocks the 80's to come out but when i got i felt like i was playing 2. The songs in 2 are better. They have the same guitars and people. It's just not worth the 50$ i spent on this game
5,A great book that;s a MUST for all Anne fans!,"This is a book that's just as wonderful as the rest of the Anne series. It's funny, it's romantic(though not as romantic as other Anne books), and it's interesting, not to mention being a great book that's a MUST for all Anne fans! If you haven't read this book, I strongly suggest that you do. You'll understand the following Anne books better, and besides, if you don't read it, you're missing out on a lot of good reading."
4,fantastic,this book shows that anne is still her old self even though engaged. i loved all the new characters ecspecially rebbeca dew. you must read this book if your an anne fan
4,A good book with 4 more to complete this series.,"I am not going to make as scathing a remark as the reader from Hong Kong-either she is too young too appreciate this book or has poor taste. The FAIR(and I don't mean pale-skinned) reviewer would admit that ""Anne of Windy Poplars"" is not as romantic as ""Anne of the Island,"" nor is it as funny and heart-warming as ""Anne of Green Gables,"" but at least it is'nt as bad as some books (I won't mention any names, fill in the blanks yourself.) I liked it, and if you intend to read any of this book's 4 sucessors, they won't make as much sense as they would don't if you read this book."
3,Too Much of a Great Thing,"The first three installments in the ""Anne of Green Gables"" series have to some of the most wonderful, enchanting, all-around greatest books I have ever read. L.M Montgomery has done an absolutely splendid job bringing to life the red-headed girl with a fiery temper to match, but the farther I progressed into the series, the more disappointed I became. For me, the series became monotonous and depressing; the war kills Anne's beloved child, and I cannot help but despair in the numerous times Anne is mentioned with streaks of gray hair, and wrinkles in her face. This is not the lively girl of Avonlea I have come to so dearly love. So, my advice to you would be to read the first three books, and the first part of the 5th, for the end of the series should not overshadow its timeless, an"
3,A fun Crazy Taxi on PSP,"The Good: Its Crazy Taxi on PSP! Fast arcadey gameplay, decent music, custom soundtracks, nice unlockables, multiplayer modes are super funThe Bad: ...Not a new CR, single player will bore you after a while, graphics aren't too swift, voices are annoyingWell Crazy Taxi 1 and 2 arrive on the PSP with smooth results. The gameplay is fast and just what you expect from Crazy Taxi but if you're not a big fan then this game will bore you after a while. The game is simple: Pick people up and drive them to their destination before the time runs out. That's really all there is. Yes you can bash into cars and drive underwater but that doesn't save CR from getting boring fast. The voices are really annoying but the music is pretty good and custom soundtracks are a great plus here. The multiplayer modes are what make the game really fun. I wouldn't buy this game but a weekend rental wouldn't hurt."
4,A Valuable Part of Our History,"This book is encouraging, but sad. This feisty lady fought the IRS all her life. She ran her life on her own terms and feared no one. The IRS, like today, got even in the end. A poignant story of the loss of our Constitution and Bill of Rights as well as our civil rights. We have lost our control over our government long ago; this is just one story among many.I am adding to this book review after reading Vivien Kellems own book: Toil Taxes and Trouble (not now available from Amazon.com). This Biography does not do Ms. Kellems justice. Toil Taxes and Trouble is a profound book of tremendous important to every American Patriot who knows the truth about our government. Ms. Kellems fought the IRS with well-researched knowledge of our Constitution and Bill of Rights and won. Unfortunately, her case was never brought to the real test before the Supreme Court. If it was, our entire history might have been changed."
4,The Appalling Strangeness,"Perhaps the most problematic of all of Greene's 'Catholic' novels, Brighton Rock explores the problem of evil and the question of faith, under the guise of gangster-action. Brighton Rock is problematic in its inability to portray the power of faith, or even the power of love. Greene's central character, Pinkie, has more faith than an average believer, 'Credo in unum Satanum', he says; yet his faith, faith in a God, faith in a Hell, has no power to save hin from utter destruction. In this novel, as in many of his others, particularly End of the Affair, Greene again struggles with the dualistic problem of body and spirit, treading the fine line between manicheaism and a simple dualism. A powerful and gripping piece of fiction, despite its theological problematic nature."
2,sterile,"I read this book because Truman Capote (a great writer) claimed it in an interview as a great novel. Boy was I disappointed. Nothing propelled me to keep turning the pages, and the Catholic symbolism in the book was ridiculously incessant, and only something a fanatical converted Catholic like Greene could have included to such a degree. Pinkie holds a wire flower and pierces his palm with it. Well, that is obviously symbolic of the nails through Jesus' hands...but for what purpose to the story, or to that scene that has nothing religious or metaphyscial in it? And while Greene is capable of great writing, I didn't find any of it in this book."
4,a study in evil,"Admittedly, this is the first of Graham Greene's novels that I have had the pleasure to read. That being said, I was thoroughly entraced by Greene's exposition of the banality of evil and the differences between absolute morality and religion. The story of an extrodinarily young (17) criminal of pre-war England gives the reader chills with its insightful and plausible view into the mind of an innocent (experiencially speaking)yet extrodinarily brutal and amoral individual and the havoc reaked in the name of self-preservation and utter selfishness."
1,"Promises, Promises..","Both Amazon and Ring of Fire have promised a delivery date yet cannot hold up to this timeline. They have charged me for delivery, although this has not, by any means been a positive experience. This, of course, led me to read the reviews of this company a little more thoroughly than I initially did and to my dismay found that the product I will hopefully receive soon will not only be shoddy plastic with little or no adhesive, but will take much longer than promised to deliver.You live and learn."
5,Fantastic book -- Taking my time reading it! Not done yet!!!,"This book is very well researched and is very detailed. I love how it shows both the good and bad in every circumstance -- painting an extremely balanced view of Walt Disney. I like how it gives me the feeling that I am living in each era, even each year, of his life -- watching him grow, really learning a great deal about his daily life and that of those around him -- as if I were a family member or a close friend. This biography is loaded with history and human interest. It is well worth your while. You won't regret buying this book for your whole family to read and enjoy."
4,Great History,This book is wonderful in the fact that it starts from the very beginning of Walt's life and gives a back ground leading into why he became the man he did.
5,An Excellent Biography!,"This is one of the best biographies I've read in a while -- a realistic and down to earth portrait of Walt Disney. The reviewer who complained that this book ""sucks the life out of Disney"" is crazy -- much to the contrary, I think this biography brought Disney to life -- who cares about excitement when you can get a first-hand sense of who the real flesh and blood man was? I loved the detail, the tidbits gleaned from memos, letters, postcards, interviews -- the book takes a broad sweep of Disney's prolific life and career, yet manages to focus in on so much interesting day to day detail that one comes away with the feeling of just having gained a very intimate glimpse into the life of a fascinating and much loved favorite uncle."
2,Sluggish,"Reading this book was comparable to watching paint dry. Water boil. Mold grow.Walt Disney was such an iconic figure of the twentieth century. Hardly a child or an adult for that matter has not been positively affected by this man's animations, features and movies...but this author's writing slogs on and on and on.What put me down the bunny-hole of murk was the sixty plus pages on the production of Snow White! That was it! Close the book! Seems to me that could have been condensed to a few pages. I made it just under half-way through this tedious, languid six hundred thirty page rendering.I believe there are better bios on Disney which I should have opted for in the first place."
1,Fantastic and very helpful,"I have just started having some lessons of BEADING and COSTUME JEWELRY. This means that I'm a biginner, but in a very short time I found myself looking on the internet for some free patterns so that I can see if I'm improving or not in this new hobby which may also gives me a fortune. And during may surfing on the WEB I went to the Amazon (...) where I have found myself in a mine of Gold of all sort of Magazines. This gave me the whealt to move step forword, and by all means I did, because I bought two very useful magazines which I'm sure that I am going to keep AMAZON the favorite to buy from. One last thing is that not only Amazon kept their promise of their date, but I have recieved them Ten ( 10 ) days before. I recommend Amazon as best suppliers to my friends."
5,Amazing,"This is one of the best soundracks I've heard in a while, and I am one who likes soundtracks. Brilliantly blended orchistral, voice, electronic and instrumental score. This kind of reminded me of the Black Hawk Down soundtrack in a way. The movie was great, the soundtrack was too. Im listening to it right now on as loud as a can!"
3,National Archives film,"A very good example of how the American propaganda industry worked. It is interesting to see how the U.S. public was told that they were helping the poor Formosans, when in truth the implanted government did very little and told the Formosans that they were doing it and not the Americans. Land reform for example was good and did help some, until the Chinese did the 228 Incident and a large amount of the reformed land went to Chinese soldiers. The régime put into place on Formosa was almost as bad as the régime that was in Mainland China, and the U.S. propaganda machine white washed it with documentaries like this."
1,Linksys WUSB54GR with RangeBooster,"Waste of money. Doesn't work. Added it to a wireless network, and doesn't work. Location of device relative to base transmitting unit is about 15 feet. Initially decided to purchase based on prior loyalty to Linksys, however quality isn't there."
5,Unbelievable,I had this adapter for 2 years and never had any problems with it. It could pick up a signal 2 houses down from mine. It is very powerful. The adapter ended up getting wet to many times and fried. I recently purchased a Belkin Wireless N USB Adapter (Mfr #F5D8053) thinking I would be able to pick up at least the same number of signals but it doesn't come close. Granted the Belkin is best used with a compatible N router I was hoping it would be able to pick up as many signals as the Linksys but it doesn't come close.
1,Be an educated consumer! You don't have to spend a lot for *digital* cables,"You don't have to spend a fortune on expensive cables when you are dealing with digital signals. Keep in mind that all digital interfaces have error correction built into them. Did you know the internal components of consumer electronics are connected with tin and nickel? There's no gold inside! So there's no need for oxygen-free, gold tipped, multi sheilded, super mega supreme cables. If you don't believe me, buy this cable and a no-name cheapie. Compare them for yourself -- you will see no difference.With analog signals, a good quality cable may make a difference (although the difference is usually only visible on an oscilloscope)."
2,Five Patients - Have Patience with your read,"I thought that the book was rather dry and pointless; I did not actually finish the book because I was so bored with it. Perhaps if I had completed it, I could have found it more enjoyable. But alas, my decision stands"
2,A Serious Let-Down,"I was very disappointed in this book after reading some of Michael Crichton's books. This is, of course, a very different type of book, but it was very drab. I'm really interested in medicine, but the book was way over my head when it came to the terminology. It has also been about 20 years since it was written so a lot has changed in the profession. I couldn't even get through the book. Perhaps someone in the medical profession would find it a little more exciting."
3,"Not a must for Crichton fan, but still a good book","I was somehow misled by the title. I thought I was going to read five short stories of how doctor can treat (miraculously) five difficult patients, those I would read in Reader's Digest. But no, indeed I was surpised that those five patients are only mentioned in 1/5 of the book. The rest 4/5 of the book are talking about everything about hospital - its history, budget, organizational structure, politics, teaching versus community hospital, surgeon, urine, anaesthesia.....I find most of these medical topics are interesting, though some are somewhat outdated. Also, I admire Mr. Crichton's writing skill to interweave these different topics together in a 200-page book.My recommedation - do not treat it as a fiction. It is not that a waste of time (onlyl 200 pages!!)"
3,Realists beware,"The Theban Mysteries is an interesting read IF you're interested in literature or drama, and if you have a few open hours. It's a quick and easy read, one that won't knock you ""off your feet,"" so to speak, but probably worthwhile. The plot tends to unravel and become too far-fetched and mediocre in terms of structure and you have to suspend some realism and belief in order to get through the book. That said, if you don't mind musing through some exaggerated and pompous dialogue to enjoy a decent (but not great) mystery, then give it a go."
5,Expose your soul,"That's what will happen if you watch and/or listen to this DVD. Jane Olivor has the most pure voice I have ever heard. But that's just the instrument. What separates Jane Olivor from all the rest is her ability to reach deep into her soul and share her raw emotion through her music--both the lyrics and the music.If you do not experience an emotional awakening from this DVD, then you should see a counselor! Open your heart, be honest, and expose your own soul to the universe!The fact that I have not even mentioned any individual songs or her performances in them should show you that Jane Olivor's performance transcends the music. The music is the canvas, and Jane Olivor's soul is the message.I'd give it 10 stars if I could. 5 will suffice."
1,Did absolutely nothing,We purchased this product because of good customer reviews. We used it several times and it did nothing for our grass.It came packaged in a plastic bag. Thank goodness. The entire contents of the bottle had spilled out during delivery. We had to literally pour the bag back into the bottle so that we had some product to use.
5,Infaormative,"InI read this book twice it is very informative and is translated beautifully, for a clear and precise account of this Glorious history this is a must READ book."
5,Continues to improve with age...,"This timeless novel is part character sketch, part comedy, and part morality tale. Set in early 1944 at a training academy for Wehrmacht officers, the story features a group of unforgettable personalities, all finding their way through the moral fog of war. Cynics, idealists, and those just trying to survive, clash following the murder of a strong-willed junior officer. Kirst draws a painfully humanizing sketch of Germany during the National Socialist era, with sometimes hilarious glimpses of a tragic society en route to ""final victory."" Written two decades after WWII, the themes are still lamentably relevant in the 21st Century."
4,Quick Introduction to Genetic Algorithm,This is a very simple introductory book to read on genetic algorithm. It provides a good overview of the main mechanisms involved. There is no theoretical treatment of the subject. The Pesudcodes provided in the appendixes have some mistakes. I recommend it for people who want quick general outline of what genetic algorithms means and how to apply it.
2,Poor man's Green Day,"The only reason I'm not giving this cd just one star is that unlike many of the other pop artists around today they actually write their own songs. They have the snotty nosed pop punk traits of Green Day but not the punch, songs or class. Sorry guys dont give up I would rather see you number 1 than Britney or Nsync."
1,"um...ok, but no.","i didn't get it. multiple persona's of one guy that have absolutely nothing to do with eachother. it was just hours and hours of crap that could have been done better.brightside: full frontal heath ledger and a christian bale jewfro.that's it. otherwise, it was mental diarrhea that was probably supposed to mean something."
2,"Pompous, Self Conscious, and False","What happens when Major Money Men and Hollywood's most bankable stars want to make an art film? This mess happens. Artsy fartsy in the truest sense of the word. Cate Blanchett does not seem/project/look like, or act like Dylan at all. Not even a little bit. Worse, she smashes her strengths as an actor (robust, sincere presence and a great voice) in attempting to. At film's end, nothing about Bob Dylan is there. Every single performance shrieks for attention in an embarrassing way (with the possible exception of Christian Bale, who at least captures the humility of Dylan the born-again preacher).At least the soundtrack is first rate.Not even slightly recommended."
5,Awsome Movie!!!,This is one of my favorite movies now. You really need to understand Dylan to understand the movie. It goes through different stages of Dylan's life as different characters. Which shows how much he has completely changed throughout his life. Anyways I highly recommend this movie to any Bob Dylan fan.
2,What's the Point??,"Was there any purpose served in trying to portray Dylan in this manner? Was any insight offered? Was there some Hollywood come-as-your-favorite-rock-star party that this thing developed out of? What's next, ""The Life and Times of Jimi Hendrix"" played by the Muppets?I stand confused your honor......"
2,Mostly disappointing,"The reasons I gave this film 2 stars: lots of Dylan's music throughout and Cate Blanchett's dead-on performance of mid '60's Dylan. Otherwise, it's an overly long, confusing, convoluted and self-consciously artsy look at Bob Dylan. If not for all the good music and Blanchett's appearances throughout most of the movie, I probably never would have struggled through the whole film."
2,Monumental Waste,"Just a really dreadful, affected ""arty"" waste of time.So bad, it's not even worth the time to tear apart. A bunch of Hollywood's most annoying twits in a tale of meaningless meandering."
1,Failure with some interesting moments.,"A bit cliched and nothing much new for those who have been intrigued by Dylan for most of his career. Maybe aimed at the attention deficit You Tubers, I don't know. The parts I found watch-able, but forgettable were the mimicry of Dylan's mannerisms and voice and recreations of his well known history-some well directed and containing bits of new (to me) biographical data and quotes. I fast forwarded through much of the film, maybe I was not being fair to the film makers but that may be because I was there."
4,tick scooper for dog,The tick scooper works great for removing ticks from my dog. My Vet uses it & I just had to have one. My only complaint is that the shipping cost was $5.00 & since I ordered 3 scoopers you charged me $15.00 even though all 3 scoopers were shipped in 1 package. They are light weight plastic tick scoopers & I believe I was overcharged for shipping. The shipping cost more than the tick scoopers themselves.
3,Hard to use,"This product works well, but only on ticks that have already swelled. We tried to remove a newly attacked tick, and it didn't work. We had to go back to the tweezers."
4,"Works great, esp for larger ticks","This makes it really easy to remove ticks from people or pets. It's a little tricky for really small ticks because they tend to rotate away from the bowl of the spoon. For those (the size of a period on a printed page) it can take a few tries to line them up properly. Overall, though, this is much easier than using tweezers or forceps."
2,Nothing like the photo on Ashton Drake website,Do not waste your time on this doll if you want it to look like the website pictures. Nothing close! Very disappointing to spend over $100 for a doll that is not at all like the website photos. They should not be allowed to advertise these dolls with the photos they currently use. They really should use the actual doll they are sending. We sent the dolls back right when they were delivered to our home.
3,Not the ''story'' I thought it was,"I am looking for the story who's plot line is much like this one, until it gets to the end (a movie I saw as a kid in the 60s). Where the (innocent) jounalist is actually strapped into the electric chair, hooded, then his editor comes in and starts talking to the jounalist about how he really wanted to know how it was to be on death row, and how now he got the full experience. They then removed the hood and, well if you know the movie I speak of, you'll know the ending. DOES ANYONE KNOW THE MOVIE I SPEAK OF? Thanks."
1,Great Idea... but didn't help our DD,"I liked the idea of this product, but it didn't do anything for our daughter."
4,Bratz Boyz trendy fun for preteen,This is a great addition to your Barbie or Bratz collection for your little girl. He is so fun and so trendy!!!
2,Mediocre,"It has come to my attention that my little sister has been writing multiple reviews for an album (under my alias of Jimi Angus Morello) she doesn't own. However, has seen the movie and plays the 30 second clips, much to my anooyance, day in and day out. From what I have heard, this album is for fans of the Chipmunks and them only, there is nothing ""special"" about this album it is all very basic music, with easy to write lyrics. In conclusion, if you don't like the chipmunks you should only buy this CD to burn it, and i mean that in a literal sense."
5,Chipmunks,Okay I've read some of the reviews and I agree with some of them but not all. The only non-chipmunks fans that wouldnt like this are the people who dont like the voices which at times make it hard to tell what they are singning. This movie is more recent than 1987 because then i was only a year old when it came out and i remeber buying it at a costco. There are 3 new songs on this soundtrack which make it better from the clips I've heard. Mexican Holiday and Flying with the egals probably would have gone where Lo Gusta and Off to see the world are. I love this soundtrack and I think anyone who gave it a chance would too. Thats the bottom line.Preview the songs just in case thats what they are for!
5,Thirteen again....,"Thirteen-year-old Guy Strang is not having an easy time of it. His parents have split up and his mom has begun dating. Guy himself starts to ponder the dating scene when a fellow classmate asks him to the movies. And so begins the comic, poignant tale of GUY TIME.This is a book that made me remember what it was like to be 13 again. Sarah Weeks recounts every painful detail, embarrassing act and awkwardness of becoming a teenager for the first time. I especially enjoyed the subtle insulting humor that is so much part of the laguage of being a teen. And Guy himself is a smart, funny and sometimes painfully aware hero who somehow makes teen angst funny and sweet all at the same time. I have not had a chance to read any of Ms wek's other books, but now I'll just have to read them all."
3,Dummies we will remain!,"This book contains significant misinformation and misrepresentations of several styles of homeschooling. If you want to learn about choices in homeschooling there are many better and far more accurate books out there including Mary Griffith's The Homeschooling Handbook and Marsha Ransom's The Complete Idiots Guide to Homeschooling. While the book has its merits, it does not represent most homeschoolers accurately."
4,THE ESSENCE OF THE 1970s,"The tune ""As You Are"" was recently clanging around in my head with Phyllis's beautiful voice and Pharoah Sander's raw saxophone playing. And this led me to finding this ""album"" ( Yeah, I'm ""Old School"" ) here on Amazon... So, Yes, I will be ordering this CD... To me this song in many ways captures the true essence of Jazz in the 1970s, albeit the late 1970s... Very ""raw"" and very real, just before everything started going all electronic and stuff... It definitely takes me back."
3,A very good and useful book.,"This book describes essential RT concepts to developers new to real time. However, an experienced developer is likely to pick up new information especially with regard to details they did not know.There were a few places where I feel the authors could have expressed themselves more clearly, but I always understood what was conveyed in the end.John"
4,"If you like Mae, you'll like this CD","Deas Vail does not have as much of a rock sound as Mae does, but there are striking similarities between the two groups. I find many tracks quite deep sonically as well as lyrically, the soundscapes and textures are only limited by a less-than stellar recording quality.I despise the use of ""emo"" to describe any kind of soft rock where the lead singer sounds like he or she is still in high school. It does a great disservice to these bands that have much deeper lyrics beyond emo favorites such as breakups and how unfair life is."
4,Huzzah for Homework,"Deas Vail is the kind of music I listen to when I'm doing homework. Not too loud, not quiet enough to put you to sleep. Very rhythmic, with drums that do more than just bang on the cymbals. The band uses a lot of piano with some guitar work to create a sort of ambient feel something along the lines of Lost Ocean or maybe even some of Mae's older, piano-laced songs. The most signature element is surely Wes Blaylock's vocals, which shift seamlessly between a standard tenor range and a soaring falsetto that sounds surprisingly natural. My personal favorite track is probably ""Lover's Charm"", which happens to showcase Blaylock's singing ability quite well. One word of warning: listeners not used to hearing men sing this high might find it a little creepy at first, but rest assured, you will get used to it quickly."
5,GREAT ERA FOR MUSIC,This is truely a great dvr and the songs are wonderful. Brings back LOTS of good memories!!!
3,Just Okay !,"I paid to see this tour last year. Not a lot of energy. They both seemed to be trying hard to make the audience feel they were still good friends, when it looks apparent they were just tolerating each other, to take home a big paycheck. However, I'm glad I saw them. They did accomplish something the Beatles could never get themselves to do.As far as this set goes, it's Okay. They omitted several songs on the CDs which they could have easily fit. Especially ""Feelin Groovy"". What were they thinking? I wonder who makes these production decisions? Cause it always happens. Why don't they just give us the complete show?"
4,R&D costs?,"Despite the two previous reviewers' irrelevant obsessing about caffeine, this is a useful medical resource, admittedly less comprehensive than the PDR but also more accessible. The problem is the price, which seems to have gotten out of hand. In the single digits, this reference work is well worth picking up every other year. In fact, you may as well plan on tossing the 10th edition (2002), which is already too old to contain references to popular medications like Lexapro, Stratterra, Zelnorm, Cymbalta or buprenorphine. But even at Amazon's discounted price, this one is too rich for a mere two years' of use. For an equally useful but more educational and durable medical reference work, pick up the Merck Manual. For info on current medications, chemistry, dosages, side-effects, check out www.rxlist.com."
2,Very Average San Diego Punk,"If you have heard a punk band hailing from the San Diego/Poway area, then you have heard the Impossible 5. If you have like Blink or Unwritten Law, don't get this album because it will only dissapoint. Look for this band to improve with future releases."
2,Crappy Tuner,I`m very Dissapointed with this boombox. The FM tuner has too much interference The FM is fine if you listen to a strong station but If you tune to a weaker station and your close to a downtown area you will hear 4 or 5 strong stations bleeding through the weaker ones. I`ve tried ajusting the coils but this model has no ajustments for FM only AM the AM has bleed too so if you try to pick up distant stations at night you may hear the strong station next to it. For example I live in Atlanta GA so the strongest AM signal is 750 WSB so if I try to tune into 780 WBBM at night I get 750 bleeding through I have had other Panasonic boomboxes that don`t have this trouble with AM. So If you listen to the radio like I do please check it out you`ll see what I mean. I hope Panasonic will correct this on future models
5,Very Good Product,"This item met all my expectations. I was looking for a small boombox that was MP3 capable. This item was larger than I wanted, but I could not find one less than 12 inches wide that had MP3 playback; this one is 16 inches. The only other complaint is that the CD is difficult to insert and remove from the spindle. All that aside, everything works fine. I have always had good luck with Panasonic products."
1,Think twice before you buy this,"Even if you enjoyed the pay per view from which this dvd was derived (and i did enjoy it very much)i think you should think twice before ordering this dvd!...I advance ordered this dvd without knowing any of the specifics about it so let me warn you that there are only two matches on it out of the six or seven matches that were on the pay per view. The Harriet Bush -Layla Hussein match was very entertaining and you get it here otherwise you get one ""Bonus"" match Cruella Bleeds Vrs Demonica Disco which was less essential. The company that put this out""Sketchy Entertainment"" should have put the whole show out instead of just two matches and brief bits of others as bonuses. If we support companies that have no respect for the consumer...it will only encourage them to release more ""sketchy"" dvds that shortchange the consumer in the future. I won't be buying future NWWL dvds from this company!"
3,Get out of the way... you're holding up progress,"A story about hired guns and the railroad.The bad guys are killing anybody who won't sellon the right of way. It gives ""Eminent domain""a new definition for the wild west.Something like ""redevelopment' in the inner cityin modern times? In MOB terms they call it an offer that you can't refuse:here they call it the ""dead man's poker hand"".The picture this movie gives is of smaller holding farmersbeing killed and their property taken by organizedrailroad thugs.When they kill an old man who had an hired hand who was once a gunslinger,trouble in a large destructive way ( a shoot out) takes place.I wouldn't call the result an happy ending."
4,Brief but interesting,"The book gives an interesting analysis of imagery on coins as they relate to the intended propaganda of the issuing emperor. The book only covers a handful of emperors with a focus on Augustus and Nero. It's an infomative and enjoyable read, however the brevity is disappointing. I wish the topics were expanded to more emperors and time periods."
3,"(3 and a half stars) Enjoyable, pretty album","""Dear Catastrophe Waitress"" is a nice, enjoyable listen. The lead singer's voice is pleasant and the lyrics are strong. ""Step Into My Office, Baby"" was the first song I hear on a college radio station and I knew I had to have the CD. This is a band that will stay on my radar for future releases."
1,Prosaic works!!,"Although I can't help purchasing this album eagarly,It made me too much disappointed after enjoyed all the songs on it.if you've never listened to B&S's works,this probably give you a gleam of joy,but if you do,you will regret having it.not a single song do touch a string of my mind,maybe their genius is giving out bits by bits."
5,First exposure is good,"This is my first and only exposure to Belle and Sebastian. I read a good review of the album in Spin, and when I saw the video for ""Step Into My Office, Baby"", I realized I had to buy the album. I was definately not dissapointed. They grapple many different types of songs on this album, but manage to keep it together as a whole. Stuart Murdoch's vocals are really good, especially on the slower song ""If She Wants Me"". Other songs I enjoy are ""I'm A Cuckoo"", with its cool guitar--not too loud and not too soft; You Don't Send Me, with awesome horns; Roy Walker, witch sounds like an eighties song; and Stay Loose, the closer with the organ."
5,I was wrong,"Stuart Murdoch made a statement recently that Belle and Sebastian used to sound like they were recording during the 60's, and that now they have moved into the 70's. Seems apt, eh? I initially wrote that this album was disappointing, and while ""Roy Walker"" is certainly so, after many, many listenings I find I love the new album. It is certainly different than older stuff; but the growth seems to mark a new direction for the band that indeed works. For fans of the older stuff, try Isobel's new album. If you listened to this with initial shock, give it a chance- it grows on you!"
5,disappointed viewer,I love this series.It was full of action and humor.The writing was great and the acting was even better.Character development was also terrific.We were so disappointed when it was cancelled.
1,What the...??,"This album sounds like an annoying coo-coo clock going off in your ear. This isn't metal...it isn't grind....it's just some lame attempt to be ""original"" and just ends up sounding like this: BING-BONG, KLINK-KLANG, KLONG, BOOM-BOMB, BANG SLANG CRANG, IDDDY-IDDY-EYE-EYE, WHOOOP, WOMP, WAH-WAH. Please save your money and buy an old CARCASS album instead."
4,Bittersweets,I purchased this album on a recommendation from a friend in San Francisco. The disc does not disappoint. Great melodies and harmonies are present throughout. At times I am reminded of Shawn Colvin or Sheryl Crow but the Bittersweets definitely can stand alone.
5,A comprehensive guide to all things mountaineering,"MFOTH is a thorough and very comprehensive book about all things mountaineering. As someone who has recently gotten into rock climbing and snow travel, I've read and referred to many parts of this book several times to develop important skill sets. This book, plus critical hands-on instruction and experience, really helps prepare people for the more technical elements of the outdoors."
5,The Classic Tome,"You will not read this book from cover to cover, but it is a must on every neophyte mountaineers bookshelf. It's the ultimate reference."
2,Horrible Recording,"I bought this cd and was very dissapointed. The first 5 songs were clear and I liked them, but after that you can't even hear them. The recording is really bad. There could be good songs on there but you'll never know. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I gave it 2 stars for the few clearer songs at the beginning. If you want a cd from Chaos UK (a really good band)just save money and get one other than this."
3,Don't believe the hype,"Yes, it was a well constructed film, with engaging dialogue and strong character development. The character of Antoine was superbly acted. And he, along with the ho-hum progression of the movie was intriguing enough to make you want to see what happens. But nothing happens. And how anyone can call this a thriller or a chilling tale is beyond me. It wasn't creepy or eerie or contain any elements that make you go ""whoa"". And it's not deep on any level to make you think. It's a character study of the intricacies of a somewhat dysfunctional marriage. I could have gotten the same marriage counseling therapy from Dr. Phil. And it would've been a lot shorter. I do recommend this film, but do not expect to be chilled or thrilled, oohed or ahhed, and you should enjoy it."
1,Mildly amusing but pointless,"Somewhat interesting - the husband's drinking problem, his insecurity, the escaped convict - but ultimately goes nowhere, and slowly."
1,The worst movie ever......,"Wow...this was so bad...it is beyond words. The dialog is terrible. The acting is stiff and awkward. And Leelee is a terrible actress and it is compounded by how unbelieveably naive and stupid her character is. Or maybe Leelee is a brilliant actress and does an amazing job portraying a really stupid character? My guess is not. She was just as stiff and awkward in Al Pacino's bomb of a movie 88 minutes. The plot of this movie sounded interesting, but that's about it. Don't waste your money or time with this."
3,Cute but pic is a bit misleading,"There is practically NO silver in this belly ring, it's almost all gold/copper and the butterfly is pretty small. it was a gift i wouldn't be thrilled if i had actually purchased it myself."
2,Lasch and Ortega y Gasset,"Having read both _The Revolt of the Elites_ recently and _The Revolt of the Masses_ several times, I am struck by previous reviewers contrasts and apparent misreadings. Ortega y Gasset argues a larger, archetypal predicament, that the supposed elites are plagued with the same lowest common denominator, mass or canned thought as everyone else is. Ortega y Gasset is writing with a slightly larger scope than Lasch and I would propose that Lasch misreads Ortega y Gasset himself and fails in his analysis. Purported 'Elites' are not an agreed upon monolith, and ostensibly those advancing the thought of Leo Strauss or, antipodally, Louis Althusser can be construed as elites. Therefore, one must respond with the criticism to Lasch of which elites are railroading democracy. I find this a simplistic indictment and far less invigorating than his excellent ""The Culture of Narcissism""."
2,Nothing new,"I am not one for ""pop psychology"" and I feel this book falls into that category. Everything that is talked about in this book seems to me to be common sense. I kept hearing things like ""the other man's grass is always greener"", ""slow and steady wins the race""; empty platitudes that you hear often. I learned nothing new from reading this book."
5,Best of Al Jolson,This a great CD with many hits on from the early day's of recording. I recommend it to all of Al Jolson Fans
3,great set,i recentely purchased the doug season1 set this set was not theat gret but the epsoides were awsome this was awsome show when i was a good and is still god today. i reccommed this set for someone who grew up watchin the show
2,Beware before buying !!,"Of course Doug is a wonderful cartoon, but these DVD's are not so wonderful. You CANNOT play them on your computer!! I realize theproblems with piracy, but this is a totally idiotic thing to do since many people don't have a DVD player and rely on their computerfor all TV/VIDEO video viewing. After fiddling with all three DVD's for a time and getting a cryptic folder with a red ""negative"" sign, I readthe fine print at the back of the package and it says: ""These discs are expected to play in DVD Video ""play-only"" devices and may notplay in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC drives."" Just know this before buying these DVD'sCome on people...find another way to protect your product."
5,Finally....,The original 'DOUG' finally on DVD. Seems so innocent and quaint when comparedto many of todays 'toons.
4,My review,It was an okay cd but it isnt exactly a hip cd for now a days. The reason why I got the cd was my 6th grade class is doing a report on the civil war and I needed it for a magizine that Iam doing. My groupe was almost done and all we needed was a song about or from the Civil War.
3,Works really great... within 2 feet of it,"Product looks nice, sturdily built. Features are cool with the remote.One thing though... if you're beyond 2 feet of it you won't feel jack. Course, I use it in my workshop which is a converted garage and so I keep it within 2 feet of me so it works really great.**Update - on further review, this heater does somewhat warm up a room if you leave it on for a few hours and the room that you want to heat up is fairly small but if you want a nice comforting blast of noticeable heat, you still need to park yourself within 2-3 feet of it.**"
2,Handle is not any good.,"I can tolerate the noise, but I do not like picking the heater up. On other models the slot for your hand works fine, but this particular model does not. You can not pick up the heater and move it with one hand. I have to put my other hand on the hot part to move it or wait until it cools down. I would never by this model again. I am extremely displeased."
5,Nice heater,"This heater looks nice, it heats up very quickly and warms the room quickly and evenly. I love that it ocilates and I love the digital thermostat. I have a couple of oil filled ""radiator"" heaters and this tower heater works so much better than those. Very good buy! Would definitely recommend."
1,Heat didn't work,"The Lasko heater i purchased was defective (purchased new). I needed something to heat my apartment since i live in FL and my apartment doesn't have heat. I did research on line and Lasko seemed like a good company. This item was highly reviewed so i purchased it. When i received it i put it together, plugged it in, and it worked. I unpluggeed it and put it to the side until i needed to use it. 2 days later we got a cold front and so i plugged it in and set it to 75. the heat was working for about 20 minutes. then i changed the setting from high fan to low fan and the heat stopped working. i tried EVERYTHING. i unplugged it and left it for 20 minutes to see if it needed to re-set. no luck. the only thing that worked was the fan, and it was blowing cold air. i am returning this and buying the honeywell motion sensor heater. my friends just purchased it for their apartment and seemed to have good luck with theirs. Until then i receive my new one, thanks Lasko, i'm freezing!"
4,toddler broke this by dropping,"Toddler loves this toy, kept him entertained during a long and stressful trip overseas. The songs seem to be sung with a UK accent, but he didn't mind. I do wish this was a bit more durable. He dropped it a few times and broke the mechanism to play the songs."
4,Nice reference and Informative,"This book is packed with many photo's and instructions on how to perform many basic and advanced tasks for working on your Honda shadow motorcycle and has proven useful for me in my general maintenance, which also include checking on the breaks, fluids, anti-freeze replacement, fuel filter and so forth. Including helpful hints on removing / getting to some of he more difficult to reach areas.I feel this was definatly a worthwhile purchase and has saved me money at the shop by better qualifying me to do some more of my own basic work / maintenance on the motorcycle."
5,Sugar Free Product,I always buy Equal as my wife is a diabetic. She prefers the blue packet over the others and this was more convenient then heading to one of the warehouse clubs. Same price so why not get it delivered and my local warehouse club doesn't even carry the large box anymore. I would have had to drive 30 minutes away. Amazon and sellers make it easy!
1,the sweetener seems to be of average quality.,the sweetener seems to be of average quality. the cost is more expensive than at the local store. So if you have a hard time getting this where you live it may work out for you but please compare the price at the local grocery before buying. thank you for your time.
4,Write a Screenplay Step by Step,"I've tried writing a coherent and complete first draft of plays and screenplays without success. This book, coupled with Field's ""Foundations of Screenwriting"", guided me through using a systematic approach, and I completed a screenplay. I was actually amazed at myself.The writing is clear, and Syd Field anticipates many problems a screenwriter will face along the way. I do credit this book with getting me to the finish line of writing a screenplay (this and MovieMagic Screenwriter). So, four stars from me.On the negative side, it probably is best for beginning screenwriters. Plus, all the examples are movies from the '80s and earlier, so it seems fairly dated. However, his basic theories you can still see in most studio movies of today. It will also only lead you in writing the standard Hollywood epic structure type of screenplay."
4,Great.,This is a great book if you want to know how to format screenplays and any other questions you might have about actually writing one. Great resource.
5,Excellent scope,"I purchased this scope for my AR-15 DPMS. It attaches to the handle/rear sights very easily. It doesn't block the rear sights so I can still use my manual sights if I want to. the scope has a threaded bolt on the bottom of the scope that goes thru the handle on the AR-15. Super easy to install. The scope is very good quality. It is easy to use. The 3-9 multiplier is on the front knob and is easy to adjust. The cross hairs inside the scope are illuminated by a battery and have an adjustable knob that allows it to go from dim to very bright so that even in bright sunlight I could see the cross hairs. For the money, this is an excellent scope. One nice feature that I didn't see listed anywhere, the scope comes with a cover for both the front and rear which are clear, so you can use the scope even with the covers on. I was surprised by how easy it was to attach and how well the scope worked."
4,Good enough for the price,"Bought this to go on my Cetme and it works as advertised. Gives enough eye relief and keeps zero. For that price, I would buy it again without hesitation."
4,Good for price!!,As i said i bought this scope for my AR-15 and it is a good cheap starter scope. One problem is that it loses zero every time i clean my rifle. Which is a pain cause i clean it quite a bit. But for a tactical scope its nice. I enjoy that i can still use iron sights with the see through riser the scope mounts on. Nothing special just cheap scope for fun.
3,What angle to sharpen and hone,When sharpening what angle should I set and to finish what angle should i hone .Are there any jigs that are used to honeknives.
2,Way over rated,"I used this on a number of US made Chicago cutlery (high Carbon steel) which were very dull. Forget 2 passes, after about 20 passes, there was still little edge. After 20 or so minutes of work, I finally got a barely usable edge. Maybe if you start with a relatively decent edge its OK but if youare starting with a real dull knife, you will not get anywhere in ""a couple of passes."""
4,"Chef's choice 120 review , after 1 year of use.","Purchased this product one year ago. Sharpened all our knives (22 of them), all sizes and shapes, four times over the course of a year. About 88 sharpening cycles. This unit is easy to use and puts a good, sharp edge on the blade. There is a learning curve for odd shaped or heavily curved blades as the knife must be drawn out evenly with the edge of the blade in contact with the sharpening disk. But with a little practice you can get a good edge. No problems with the unit but it does seem to get hot after extended use (15-20 knives). The blades come out very sharp, although I believe a good "" hand sharpening "" puts on a slightly sharper edge. The reason I purchased this is that it takes me forever to sharpen by hand. It only takes me a half hour to sharpen all 22 knives with this machine. After one year of use this unit works like the first day we purchased it. Small, easy to use and it works. I would highly recommend this product."
4,"Easy to use, sharp knives",Product is easy to use. I finally have knives with a sharp edge.I'm happy with my purchase.
4,Pretty darn good,"Let me just start this review by saying that I was a butcher for 10 years and know how to sharpen a knife plus I'm serious about my blades. I just got this and have tried it out on several of my non-special cooking knives. I have to be honest it has left a really nice edge. Now.. nothing beats a good stone, but I have to admit i was impressed..It left a nice edge (shaved my arm) and didn't seem to grind the heck out of the blade. My main concern was that it would damage the knife, but so far using as instructed the knife is fine. The edge is nice and clean... I currently have no complaints."
5,Greatest sharpening product I've ever used,"I've tried all the other cheap sharpeners that just doesn't do it. After running your knives on this, you can shave with them. No joke, that's how I showed my friends how good it works. Shaved the hair right off my arm.If your looking for a knife sharpener look no further, well worth the price without a shadow of a doubt."
3,Chef's choice sharpener,"Sharpener seems to work OK, but not really as good as I had expected. I'm not used to electric sharpeners so maybe it works better than most, I don't know. It seems to be good enough for the quick edge in the kitchen, but for a really fine edge, I stick with my Lanskey hand sharpener."
3,"Performs OK, but not quite what I expected","Decent product, and it does sharpen my knives pretty well, but for $130+, I don't find it a very good value."
5,Sharp Knife!!! YEAH,I love this knife sharpener. I even bought one for my sister. It works well. Is easy to use. Yes... it is loud and clunky but it really works. I love to cook and do so frequently. I really hate a dull knife. We use our knives everyday and this is a sharpener that works for us.
4,Anglican Chant at its best,"If you like Anglican chant, then you will enjoy this CD. It is very prayerful and worthy to be listened to. My only negative comment would be that St. Paul's is terrible to record in. The reverb time is fine for the organ, but the choir always sounds mushy and ""cloudy"". Fuzzy is another word that comes to mind. St. Paul's choir is very good, but the recording just doesn't do them the justice they deserve."
4,Okay.,"It's pretty good, but for some of the songs, it felt like they were rushing to production, in that there were a lot of choices they could have made but didn't. But most of the songs are good- although in many ways it just doesn't measure up to the hardcoreness (for lack of a better word) of their other cd's. Hey- what happened to Chris's kickass solos? Anyway- one of these reviews said that it lost some rockability. This is partly true. Some of the songs aren't so rockable, but many are. So, not their best cd, but it's worth it (especially used).Peace.P.S.- good songs: End of the World, Jimmy, One Said to the Other (sort of), Tabloid Magazine, et al.P.S.2- don't download. be honorable. buy the songs if you like them.P.S.3- incidentally, most of the good songs i listed are the ones that are more like their other songs."
4,good value,I really don't like the swiveling feature of the ear clips. The slightest tug on the speaker wire causes the earphone to swivel away from your ear. Phillips makes an earphone with the ear clips being fixed and it keeps the earphone more snug to your ear. The sound of these units is as advertised.
3,Good for the Price,The sound from these earphones is very good. One flaw is that one of the earphone wire is shorter than the other. MC
5,The Eternal Way,"What we call Hindu, the Hindu's call 'The Enternal Way'. For Hindu was a geographical location, not a religion. Over time those outside their religion began to associate the term with a religion.Andrew Harvey is the editor of this book and compiles an anthology of Hindu poems, meditations, and philosophical texts emphasizing Tantric tradition and the yoga of devotion.Included are writings of Mirabai (circa 1498-1546), Ramprasad (1718-1775), and Aurobindo (1872-1950) and excerpts from their sacred scriptures. This book is a good introduction to start your studies on the teachings of the Hindu Mystics."
1,Previous model caught on fire!!!!!,I own an earlier version of this humidifier. It was less than four years old and cleaned and maintained according to the manufacturer recommendations. The unit malfunctioned and caught fire - smoke and flames!!- when we were sleeping causing thankfully only smoke damage. Bionaire refused to respond other than to send some forms so I was forced to go to the state and federal consumer agencies. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH BIONAIRE!!!!!
1,FAILED! in less than 4 hours,I bought this in the morning. Returned it 4 hours later!Failed to emit and properly work within those 4 hours!Do not be fooled by the sophistication of the product(UV Light). Seems like an afterthought to poor function.I read other reviews that this could start a fire. Who wants a humidifier that could essentially start a fire anyways.This will break down on you eventually look at other popular brands in the same price range. Definitely read the reviews.Beware the Bionaire!!
5,Very Accurate,"I'm a little surprised that some of the reviewers question the accuracy of the GPS. I have calibrated dozens if not hundreds of times and have found it completely accurate with the exception of being near high tension wires, which makes it go a little crazy and will show me running a 2 minute mile in one direction and then a 30 minute mile coming back the other way. I haven't had this problem often."
1,It's a POS - Avoid,"GPS portion does not work (Expect long acquisition time and frequent interruptions in satellite contact) and the watch shows wear/tear pretty much immediately.Do yourself a favor, either pay up for a better system from a GPS focused company that works passably well or save your money and stick with a cheaper watch/heart monitor combo."
4,Excellent Jazz/Salsa CD,"I got this CD and couldn't stop dancing. While it was made back in the 60's before I was born, I find it light, jazzy and I can't be still when I listen to it. A must for any serious jazz collector."
1,"Wow, what a bad movie...",This movie is really bad. These characters are such a bunch of morons I don't know why the bear took so long to kill them. I wish I could give it no stars.
2,CPO Did Not Include Saw Blades,Great saw but CPO did not provide the three blades on this reconditioned saw that comes with a new model. Note there is another review pointing this out - so it is not an oversight.
1,Pointless and boring,What the heck did I just watch? This movie made no sense. It jumped from one pointless and unrelated scene to the next. Just one stupid movie. Life is too short to waste over an hour of it watching this drivel.
3,Poorly made but better than nothing,"I have had two Metro Cage/Crate cooling fans. Right now I am staring at the second one and writing this review before I dump it. The plastic connector broke, leaving me unable to attach it to the crate. The wires in the battery compartment broke on my first fan. Unless I can find something better, I will probably buy a third, since they worked reasonably well for a while."
3,Useful But Battery Life Not Even Close to 80 Hours,"The Metro Vacuum Cage/Create Cooling Fan seems to work pretty well. The two plastic hooks sit well on a standard small pet cage. However, the batteries do not seem to last anywhere near the 80 hours claimed in the product description. And, this is based on the fan being left on the low setting (there are two fan speed settings). Based on having it just two weeks, it also appears that the batteries shake lose and need to physically readjusted to touch the battery connectors correctly every other day or so. That said, it has been useful and is reasonably priced for what it does and I'm mostly satisfied with the product"
5,"Works great! Good battery life, too","Bought two of these for our pugs when driving over the summer. I put fresh batteries in when we left Chicago and they were holding up very well when we hit New York. For maximum cooling, I put fresh ones in for the return trip, but we probably could have made it much of the way with good power on the first sets."
3,How about proofreading,As others have said the story was good and kept your interest. The Kindle version was a nightmare to read due to typos and words strung togeteher - probably 20 per page! This distracted from the read!
3,Be prepared for a liberal assault.,"A fairly exciting read, but peppered with assaults on talk radio, conservative values and people, and pushes an agenda of reinstating the 'fairness doctrine' while overlooking the biases of the major networks, newspapers, and educational institutions. The author provides a list of characters in the front of the book, as wellas a list of geographic places, so you can keep the plethora of them straight. A complicated twisting plot that is interesting, but easily put away for another evening's read."
4,"Great movies, so-so DVD","I love these movies - I remember watching them as a little kid. Even though the jokes went flying over my head when I was younger, there was still quite a bit for me to enjoy and laugh at. Now that I'm older, I catch a LOT more of the jokes, and the movies are still hilarious!I'm so glad that the movies are packaged together, but I have two (fairly small) qualms: first of all, both movies are in fullscreen. Not a big deal to some people, but the pan-and-scan is noticeable in some of the more fast-moving scenes. Second, neither DVD has special features of any kind. I would love to hear the star's reactions to the movies, or see a deleted scene, but these are nowhere to be found. All in all, though - DVDs worth having."
1,Intentional Intervieweing and Counseling,This book did not arrive on time and when it did arrive was in a horrible condition. I was in the process of requesting a refund when the book arrived.
5,Full of stimulating and thought provoking ideas,"I met Dr Megan McKenna for the first time last summer in Scotland, we spent a week working together in the house of a mutual friend.She was preaching on Sunday and giving a workshop on one of the evenings during the week. There were three services on the Sunday an for once in my life I actually returned to hear the same sermon preached twice. What was even more impressive was she kept the congregation spellbound while she was preaching - they hung on her every word.This is another of her works, which lets us reproduce some of her tremendous insights - if alas not her style!This work deals with the reading for Lent it is a splendid book packed full of stimulating and thought provoking ideas for sermons. However it goes beyond that. I should also recommend it a tool for personal reflection and meditation for everyone.If you would like to take time to meditate over the scriptures and do not know where to start this book is an excellent point of departure."
4,Fowler doesn't disappoint!,I'm a big fan of Earlene Fowler and this installment doesn't disappoint. Lot's of interesting characters and twists. She kept me guessing til the end!
4,Accompanying Website,I had to buy this book for a class I am taking. The accompanying CD-ROM and website are extremely helpful and make reviewing the information in the book more interesting. The crossword puzzles of the important terms are a fun twist on studying. The glossaries that can be printed out from the website to accompany the chapters make studying for a test a breeze.
4,Reasonably good,"I have had no problem with this recorder/player since I purchased it a few months ago.I would have to disagree with a previous reviewer who said that the ""eight hour mode looked better than a VCR set on the best quality setting"". I would never use the eight hour mode, which is the maximum time this recorder can get on DVD media. At this mode, every other horizontal AND vertical line is taken out resulting in poor picture. In addition there is noticeable jerkiness and picture noise.I also want to clarify that this recorder does NOT record to CD-Rs as the previous reviewer mentioned. The DMRE55K only records to DVD-R and DVD-RAM.It plays MP3s but it reads only the name and not the ID3 tags."
1,WHAT THE HELL?,LEMON! MY FIRST NIGHT FIRST RECORDING AND SELF CHECK SHOWS UP AND WILL NOW COME OFF OF THE MACHINE! IT HAS BEEN LOCKED UP FOR 2 HOURS NOW . THE DVD IS STUCK IT WON'T OPEN! I TRUSTED THE REVIEWS AND AMAZON AND GOT THIS MESS! I CAN'T WAIT TO CALL IN THE MORNING! I GIVE IT NO STAR!
1,dont waste 23 dollars on this,I ordered this supposedly rare color set thinking 23 dollars was a good price for fond memories....what I got was a 1960s-70 VHS quality colorized copies...yes the tapes are still faded and the color unnatural in spots...Hollywood can do anything digially these days but whomever is distributing and making money on this evidently does not care. Amazon please include a note specifing what one is getting on your site ..a disclaimer at least..you are too good a company for this kind of business selling tapes one can record over the airwaves!!!!Also they are coming out with DVDS in May I hope they are better...
5,Great game,"Excellent board/dice game! Nice combination between strategy and chance. Board setup and style is very nice. Rules seem much more compicated than they really are. Easiest just to start playing and the rules work themselves out pretty quickly (even my 5 year old caught on after just a couple ""half"" games)."
3,Live in 1973,"Made in UK in 2000, Serial# GLASS-102-CD, Playing Time 69:00The material on this disc was recorded in concert from 2 different sources: tracks 1-7 from Palesports in Torino, Italy back in 1973 (""In A Glass House"" era), and the recording quality is abominable: the master tape probably comes from a cassette in someone's winter jacket! The sound balance that's left is mostly keyboards and vocals, while the bass and guitars are drowned...However, this is the first time I hear a rendition of ""Plain Truth"" in concert, and it features an interesting violin solo.The last 2 tracks come from a broadcast with much greater sound quality, and you can hear the band at their musical best.An interesting document overall despite the general sound quality. Get it if you're a die-hard fan, otherwise, if you want some live stuff, get ""Playing The Fool""."
5,Homeward Bound 1 & 2,Granddaughter loved it! She has been asking for this for a while and is so happy to finally be able to see it whenever she wants.
5,Gift for grandkids,A beautiful story recommended to me by a friend so I ordered this for my grandkids. Touching story of animals on a journey. Thank you so much.
4,Wonderful feel-good movies,"Just a technical review: Two disc collection. The first movie is in FULL SCREEN (why why oh why???), has a theatrical trailer. The second movie is in widescreen and has no trailer. The first disc is clearly a first edition from WB as it has the design of their early discs, nice silkscreened with a pale coating that lets the title and info be readable, while the second is a ""picture"" disc with all artwork pasted on the disc. Seems like a rushed thing to make this double-pack which could have been done better in my opinion.Still, good value."
2,Not Enough Texas,"This is an okay general guide for beginners in home landscaping. However, it is not particular to Texas, despite its title. There are only about 30 pages devoted to plant material, and this is not covered in depth. The text makes no real attempt to help gardeners select plant material suitable to the many different soil types and environments found in Texas."
2,Story fragments and overpriced.,"The publishers give a lot of unfinished stories from a conan variant ,and want to charge us an arm and a leg for a book that needs to be neithor printed or shipped,not a good buy."
4,Catchy Christian pop-punk,"This new band falls roughly into the same style as mainstream pop-punk bands like Collective Soul and Jimmy Eat World. With the Afters, the emphasis is on the pop side more than punk. They do rock out on occasion. I bought this on a whim and was glad I did. I was a little dismayed when I found out this was a Christian group (not being too big a fan of Christian music), but the Afters will now be part of a small, select bunch of Christian artists whose music I like. Singer Josh Havens has a great vocal style that is smooth but with an edge, plus they've got the crunchy guitars, good songwriting, etc. My 4-star rating is a bit generous (I was originally thinking 3 & 1/2 stars), but this was a CD I pretty much enjoyed all the way through, so what the heck."
3,Something's Missing,"I don't get it, ""Beautiful Love"", ""Someday"" are great songs, the rest are OK. I don't know why, but they're just OK. Nothing really caught my interest except for two songs. But I might have found more if they had MORE THAN 10 TRACKS! I mean really, they cut some stuff, they had some stuff in the wings. Make me feel like I spent my money well! For ten dollars I could have gotten this on I-Tunes. Any more than that, and just forget it, it's a waste of money. But The Afters has great potential. They have what it takes to be a great band. They just didn't bring that in this album, except in small quantities. So skip the album, buy the above mentioned songs. Hopefully The Afters take advantage of their potential in the next album."
4,The Harvest,"The Harvest kept my interest, and the medical dicription was very detailed. The ending, and the people involved were not given away in the body of the story but misdirected. I enjoy Tess Gerritsen novels."
4,Medical Thriller,"Harvest by Tess Gerritsen is an outstanding novel for anybody who loves medical thrillers/mysteries. The novel is so intense, mainly because of Gerritsen's background in medicine since she has her M.D. The novel is suspenseful at several parts and keeps the reader interested the entire way through since there is not a dull moment throughout. I would recommend it to anybody who is interested in medical books. As well, it makes the reader wonder who they can and cannot trust. A book with purpose!"
5,Chilling medical thriller!,"Harvest was the first Tess Gerritsen book I've read. All I can say is 'wow'. I wish I would have started reading her books sooner.Harvest was one of the best medical thrillers I have ever read. If you've Michael Palmer, Robin Cook, Don Donaldson or David Shobin, I guarantee you'll love this book.Right from the beginning I was hooked. Many times while reading this book I got so involved in it that I would feel anxious or upset at times. I will be sure to read all of Tess Gerritsen's books!"
4,Nice pass time,"Enjoyed the book. This was my first time reading a ""medical thriller"". Good read for traveling or on vacations. Had a surprising unexpected ending."
3,Dream turns into nightmare,"Abigail DiMatteo is a 1st year resident at Bayside hospital. She thinks her dreams have come true when she's offered a spot on the cream of the crop transplant team, of which, her boyfriend, Mark is a part. Little does she know the dream can quickly turn in to a nightmare when she doesn't play the ""game"". Meet little Yakov, spunky surgeon Vivian Chao, the General-Dr. Wettig, and a cast of hospital players. A quick read."
4,Forget About Those Other Medical Mystery Writers,"Pick up this entertaining, suspenseful novel by Tess Gerritsen M.D. Dr. Abby DiMatteo is a surgical resident who gets curious about some strange happenings at her hospital. Her curiosity plunges her career into a downward spiral that seems to have no bottom. Once again we have a female protagonist who is not a wimpy, ankle-spraining female in need of a strong man (Thank God).Although the reader quickly becomes aware of where the story is going, the gripping narrative never lets one relax. TG is one physician novelist who believes in really adding some medicine to her books. Some readers may be turned off by her frequent injections of technical terms, but to me it just made the story more real. In this regard she reminds me of Kathy Reichs, the forensic pathologist who wrote the novel Deja Dead. Only Harvest is better."
4,A Page Turning Thriller!!!!,This was a page turning thriller from start to finish. I love this author since she has the ability to craft a story with plenty of suspense and does not give up the bad guy until the final pages. This keeps you guessing and reading to the end. This story was faced paced with great character development. A great read for anyone who enjoys medical thrillers!
4,quality metal back again,"i bought this cd at a store as a random cd. it looked cool and the name was good. but the quality is more than skin deep. this is a phenominal metal album. it has speed skill guitars, cool lyrics that remind me of rhapsody and the vocals are really dead on. i would recomend picking this up."
3,Hits the spot!,"Great bullet vibrator.The battery casing is a little 'cheap', but the wire connection seems quite secure. I don't like it as much as my original silver buller (ah, I miss that thing), but it has great speed variations and the cord is long enough.The price and the red pouch really are what sold me. I don't like the battery tube, but for the price and the RPMs....I actually bought 3. One for me, my little sister and my new sister-in-law...neither of which have ever used a vibrator before! ;)"
1,No Where Near What The Picture Looks Like!!!,"I ended up donating one basket since I had already opened the box so I refused delivery of the remaining. The color was a bright orange and the lining was polyester, not at all what I expected. When you purchase from Amazon and it is an external vendor drop shipping you cannot find more detailed product descriptions so you are taking a real chance when you make a purchase. I have learned my lesson at this point, I do not purchase drop shipped items since you can get burned on the return shipping."
4,Laundry Basket,"Basket is well built and appears to very sturdy, should last a long time, even during strenuous use. Seems to be a good value."
4,Does the job,"I needed some place to put some bath towels and toilet paper in the bathroom that doesn't have a closet. An interior decorator told me to get a basket and put it in one of the corners for that purpose. This did the job. It's too small to be used as an everyday laundry basket, and would probably fall apart pretty quick if used like that. But for my purpose it does nicely, it can hold about 5 towels, some wash cloths and a couple of rolls of toilet paper."
2,Size does matter,"This basket was actually quite nice (ordered 2) but much smaller than advertised - actual size was more like 21x14x11, could not believe how small the baskets were! Buyer beware."
2,thin split weave,"Broke the handle taking it out of the box (really). Was looking to replace our current wicker laundry basket, but this one should not be used for wet laundry or even heavy dry loads. Almost all the reeds are spit, creating a very weak basket. It does look nice though."
5,Vanity table,This vanity is better than what I had expected for the price that I gave for it. It has a high quality finish and I would recomend it to anyone.
5,I thouroughly enjoyed this excellent trilogy.,"Mary Stewart's trilogy dealing with the Arthurian legends is a favorite of mine. I enjoy reading the humanized version of a legend which I find intriguing every time I pick it up. The author did an excellent job of bringing the characters to a level at which the reader can sympathize with them while still looking upon them with a certain fascination. As Mary Stewart is one of my favorite authors, this opinion may be biased, but I think everyone who has never read at least one book of the Merlin Trilogy has missed a truly satisfying experience and should rectify the situation as soon as possible."
4,mary stewart merlin trilogy,An excellent value for the price; plus Mary Stewart never fails to entertain me with her writing style and her storylines.
4,Good and easy to use HRM watch,Good value. It takes about 30 minutes to learn how to use its features. The chest band requires moisture when you are just testing it without engaging in real work out situations. Once you are working out the band records the information really well.
2,Great looking....poor taste....more than half broken...,"I purchased this cookies for my sons 2 bday....they are really cute, great party favor...the taste is so-so no big deal....when I ordered them I bought 2 boxes since I had read other reviews where they said that they got a lot of them broken....good thing I did this since more than half of them where broken, eventhough I sent a request for extra care in handling them...the other big problem was that each box only has 4 minnies, so many of the girls ended up with mickey, donald or pluto!!!"
5,Love it!,"Fantastic CD, can't listen to it enough. Makes great driving music. I am in the process of collecting all of the volumes."
1,CAN'T HANDLE EVEN A LITTLE WORK,"I've been thru 2 of these in less than 3 months. With little run time and a very moderate work load I blew out 2 of these units, they just can't handle any pressure without overheating. Use it as a light sander or to remove some rust or basic polishing but don't push it or BLAM!Dremel 400-2/51 400 Series XPR Rotary Tool Kit With 51 Accessories"
3,Useful,This book is actually pretty descriptive. I feel that overall it grasp a good understanding on policy and it makes it easy to read. I still have the book and I don't want to sell it because I know I can be helpful later
2,Sound disappointing,"I bought this several months ago for size. I had planned to use it for parrot training CDs and occasional listening to music and audio books. Didn't need or want cassette. For those uses, it is adequate. I would have given 3 stars had the speakers not been so disappointing and the price out of line with the performance. I still like the size and appearance, but haven't electronics progressed far enough in the last 25 years to provide a really compact unit that doesn't make great music sound sick? I don't think I would purchase again."
1,"Good form factor, poor quality","I purchased one of these units 9 months ago because I loved the size. The compact design makes it easy to leave on a kitchen counter, or anywhere and tote around the house.Unfortunately, even with scarce use, the CD motor started making a loud hissing sound when playing CD's that made the unit unusable for CD playback. Sony guarantees labor for only 90 days, so they informed me that it'd cost me $42 in labor plus shipping for them to service this unit.While I don't expect any CE vendor to warranty and stand behind their products forever, this speaks of Sony quality or at least of this model."
2,Lousy reception,"I purchased this because of it's small, sleek design. Unfotunately, we can only access a few radio stations because of the terrible reception. The sound is okay but I would not recommend it."
2,"Nice design, but useless for playing CDs","I bought this unit to use at work, so the size and design are what actually sold it. Unfortunately, I cannot play CDs in it anymore because of the annoying clicking noise they make when playing. The radio reception isn't too great either (that may just be my office and not a reflection of the player), so it ends up just collecting dust on my desk. I won't buy another similar product from Sony."
5,Ditmars The Reptile Book,Ditmars' observations gain value as the years go by. The Reptile Book was published over 100 years ago but is still great reading.
4,"Good book, but it requires a lot of work to be useful","Reading this book will not help you write proofs in the least. How to Prove It, to help you at all, will require lots of time and effort after reading each chapter, actually doing proofs.Anyone who has done proofs, or attempted to do proofs, should not be surprised that there is no magic key. Working through this book is required for improvement, just a quick read will get you no where.That said, the time is well worth it. When you think back to how hard proofs used to be after working through the book, you will feel like a super genius with your new found skill."
3,"A good start on writing proofs, but falls short!","I found that this book utilized a little too much set theory for beginning students. If the author could have given more concrete examples, perhaps from group theory or simpler ones from analysis or number theory, it would have been much better. For students wanting a more lucid exposition of proof techniques, I highly recommend, ""100% Mathematical Proof"" by Rowan Garnier and someone else,whos name escapes me at the moment. ""100% Mathematical Proof"" is far superior to this book, and it has answers to the exercises which is crucial to the beginning student learning on his/her own. Velleman needs to bring the abstract nearer to the concrete for the beginning student."
1,Horrible,"I bought a 1.49$ lip pencil, among other items. This lip liner was totally defective.The bottom of the pencil twisted as if it would turn up which it didn't. I contacted the seller to exchange, they told me to sharpen the pencil, which I did. Then the entire inside of the lip liner fell out staining my carpet. The price is irrelevant, Point is terrible customer service and rotten product!Stay away"
5,For travelers who want to stay off the beaten path,"After (physically) examining a dozen or so different guides to D.C., this is the one we chose. As with all Rough Guides, it's light on photos and fluff and heavy on information. It told us what we needed to know to get to the monuments and other famous sights, but also steered us into some of the local neighborhoods for great, affordable food. This Rough Guide contained more history than most of their city guides -- great for the international visitor or the American who wants to know the stories behind the city. One caveat to families: there's not much ""what to do with the kids"" information."
3,Good player but no case is a bummer,"I really like this DVD player, but it doesn't come with a case. The CyberHome case/auto mount that I also bought from Amazon doesn't work well at all. It's too small and complicated for the Philips player. My old DVD came with a case, and I would recommend buying one that does. A good, well suited case/mount is almost as important as the player itself. YaknowwhatImean?"
3,Just died after less than 2 years of service!,"I have been disappointed with this player overall. Our first portable dvd player was the cheapest Wal-Mart no name brand. It lasted about 2 years and then died. This time, we thought we'd spend a bit more for a quality brand. But in the end, the lifespan of this Philips PET710 has been about the same--didn't last two years.Our usage: We are pretty careful with the player and use it maybe for an hour or two at a time maybe 3-4 times a week.Pros: The picture quality was good. Battery life was adequate. Sound quality was good. Isn't really finicky about which DVDs it will play.Cons: Broke after a less than two years. When we used it on airplanes, the sound was often too quiet--the volume is limited. Buttons are inconveniently placed--it is easy to hit the wrong one when getting a dvd forward or back to the right place.I'm frustrated that the Philips brand seems to not mean much. Maybe next time we'll try Sony."
3,Not really what I was looking for (not a technical book),"I purchased this book hoping to learn more about the specifics of HFC and Telco network design. I was disappointed that find out that this is really not a technical book, but more of a historic walk through how the battle has played out between Cable/DSL and makes allot of predictions for the future I don't really agree with. Maybe this is a good book for potential stock investors trying to predict which broadband technologies will ultimately prevail (if the predictions were more correct) but this is definitely not a book for engineer-techie types."
2,where are some songs?,"this soundtrack does NOT have all the songs in it from the movie. i was looking for two from the movie, and the soundtrack did not have them. like, a song by michelle branch that is in the movie is not in there. boo"
2,Hydrogeologist finds this book lacking in many respects.,"The good points for this book are the scope of the discussion; Most of Chapter 3, Identification of Biased Environmental Data; and, the color plates. However, there are some notable errors in the book and strong statements that deserve quite obvious and important caveats. There is no discussion of the importance of effective porosity. Using the wrong porosity value is a common error used to bias analyses of contaminant transport velocity. There are errors such as stating that organic carbon is associated with clay content, which is completely wrong in many parts of the country where clay residuum dominates. Clay minerals have no carbon content themselves, but may be associated with organic materials in alluvial settings. There are many such problems with this book and I am hesitant to offer it to those learning the practice because of all the corrections I'd need to make."
5,Great Home Design Software for Starters,"I am an interior design student and I have bought over 5 home design softwares including Punch pro home design. Out of all the home design softwares that I have had, I kept this one. Sierra home designs have current up to date furniture that you can find in anyone's home today. It's also easy to import new colors, wallpaper designs and objects. If you are just starting out, I would reccommend this software to help you create the plan that you are looking for. It also carries a couple of plans for apartment living also."
5,Happy,If you love poetry...will you will find this book like no other for poems that truly touch the heart in any circumstance in life.
4,Still a staple after 43 years!,"As the author of The Beer Drinkers Diet also available on Amazon, I know a thing or two about this subject. However, this book was first written before I was even born!It is hard to believe that many of its principles still have merit today after four decades. This book is truly old school.Although this book is nothing more than a small pamphlet, it is hard to lose for a book that costs a few bucks.The bottom line is that it still has merit after all of these years! Cool lil' pamphlet!"
5,The Best Radio Friendly Rock! Great Lyrics Great Vocals!,This group should not be missed. Terrific lyrics and great sound. Music you can really relate to.
3,needles are ok,"I have a lot of Boye needles, including other size/length circulars and am really frustrated at how stiff the cable is. It is really slowing me down because I'm constantly fighting with it instead of zooming thru the baby blanket I'm making. The needles themselves are great, the joints where the needles meet the cable are smooth and don't snag, but the cable makes the needles nearly unusable. Unfortunately I will be buying a different brand in order to finish the blanket."
2,Cheesey,The cord that connects the two needles is cheesey. I can't even begin to knit something with these things. The area where the needles and cord connects is tilted the wrong way as well; so it will be impossible to make a circle even if the cord relaxes.
2,Battery quit after only a week,"We bought this watch for my son for Christmas, and he was very disappointed when it quit working after only a week. It had to be taken apart to discover that the battery was not properly installed. Don't know if the watchmaker or the seller was responsible for this. I would NOT purchase from this seller again."
5,Blessed Like That,"Elder Jimmy Hicks and VOI are based in West Palm Beach, Fl. They truly are Blessed Like That. This Album is by far,one of the best Gospel albums in History. Please Pray and support ElderJimmy Hicks and VOI As they tour on a national Level."
5,Tiffany Wrapping Paper,"I do stained glass work, so was thrilled to find this paper.I wrapped SG gifts in it at Christmas.I plan to give the paper itself, as gifts this year.( Along with glass pieces, of course! )"
2,Overheating issue,"Hope I'm not the only one to notice this, but compared to the older Dremel that I had used for years, this new model feels a little more flimsy in comparison. The real problem came when I used the XPR for an extended amount of time. After using the stone cutting blade for about half an hour, the unit got too hot to hold with bare hands, and stated emitting a burning smell. I had to let the unit cool off, and left wondering if I made the right purchasing decision...If it's any indication, the unit comes with a small set of rotary bits. Though the inside of the toolbox holding the bits was made of cheap molded plastic that can be crushed by a finger. Leaves me wondering what other corners were cut to keep the cost down. My confidence on Dremel as a brand had been scarred by this new series."
1,Nope!,"Another great concept...with yucky results. This sack even after many washings never softened up. It is so rough and scratchy, it offends my skin, much less a baby's. It may work for you, but not my little one!"
5,Dang!!!!!!,"The best, by far, ICP CD since the Great Milenko, Insane Clown Posse is making some big improvements. And for all you devel walkin juggalos, the unvieling is a big suprise, but a very good song. I rated this a 5 because it was one of the better albums that the Insane clown Posse have let out."
4,An absorbing SF romance,"This is a beautifully constructed story. I was quite surprised how much I enjoyed it: rather than the regular science fiction novel I anticipated I was absorbed in one that might fit better in the ""young adult romance"" category. Just the same, I had to stay up way past my bedtime to finish it.As a writer, I'm jealous of Karen Haber's sparing use of words and scenes. Only an inspired editor could find anything to cut. The characters' reactions are short, sharp, and almost always emotional rather than physical (i.e., violent).This is the first Haber novel I've read; it won't be the last!!"
2,Book Reveiw,"A little worm keeps a journal sharing daily life from worm's point of view.It very funny, such as ""Dad was busy eating the newspapers"".He worries about fishing asthe little worm does not want to be used as bait. Also, making it across the playground without getting stomped on. On the blacktop the kids are jumping ropes so it is hard to get across. See how the worm feels about itself. He finds good things and bad things about his life as a worm in this great big world. Find out what it feels like to have a worm's eye view of life.(...)"
5,Worms anyone?,This is a great book for anyone teaching about the earth and in particular - worms. The kids love the illustrations.
4,Funny book for older children,"It is a very funny book but for children 7 and older, I find myself explaining my 6 year old girl, almost every joke."
4,It is a great story!,I like the diary of a worm. It was hilarious. My favorite part of the story was when he said your face will always look like your rear end. The men in black kind of freak me out. You shoud read this story because it is a great story. It has so much details. It is a great story.
5,funny and cute,"My kids absolutely love this book. We read all the ""diary"" books but the worm is our favorite."
4,Diary... not story... of a worm,"This children's book is a pleasant overview of the experiences of a school-aged... worm. It is difficult to tell what grade the worm is actually in, given that homework is often eaten.The illustrations are witty, as are the activities covered in the diary.There is not a story that flows through the book, however, other than worms are good for the earth.Remember to dig a bit deeper, whether you are a worm or a fisher, when the fish are biting."
2,all basic concepts,Basic concepts to beginners or students.It also lacks for implementation details.Most of the them are not new to an experienced programmer.
5,from Medical Herbalism journal,"This is the oldest book of Chinese Herbalism, from circa 100 AD, translated into English for the first time. An excellent contemporary trnaslation renders the book still fresh and useful reading for those familiar with Chinese herbs."
1,READ CAREFULLY,"Just so you don't make my mistake, this is ONE candle for 30 bucks. I thought there was eight of them they way they talked about it. I mean for crying out loud the stupid title of the item is ""Votivo Color Collection Poured Scented CandleS ""NEW"". Notice the use of plurals and words like ""Collection"" in both the title and description. Sure the thing is really cool looking, it weighs alot for a candle of its size and the box that it comes in is like leather-bound. So basically your paying for an ordinary candle, ordinary smell, and some fancy smancy glass holder and and box. It's not even a big candle, about the size of a small drinking glass.So, bottom line, it's ONE small to medium size candle for 30 bucks"
1,Bad Love,"My first time reading anything by this author and also my last. This book was so not interesting and it was also boring. It went no where and it was very redundent, the dog over and over.I thought I was reading a book about a bull dog, it was just a no brainer? I would not recommend this book to anyone I know who loves to buy and read books as I do.I never give any of my books away however, I just changed my mind this book it now owened by a new reader?"
2,Not the best book for the office,"Sticky Note origami contains a lot of models that you would have already seen in many basic origami books. Many of the models do not actually have to be folded with sticky notes.If you want a book for some quick cleaver folds for the office, I suggestOffice Origami: The Highly Successful Slacker's Guide to Workplace Procrastination. Its another basic book, but I'd rate it higher than this one.With that said, this book is not a complete write off, the Wizard shown on the front cover is quite cool. I guess its not too bad for the price, and maybe beginner folders would like it."
2,Not So Clever,"I thought I was going to get instructions for little origami figures/animals but that is not so. Most of the designs require more than one sticky and the designs are pretty ridiculous as in ""What the heck would I make that for?"" I'm not even inspired to try one design and I am an artsy crafty person! It's a waste of money for the book and a big waste of sticky notes. I'm glad I bought a used one for a few bucks."
5,A Rivetting Film!,"This is a brilliant film. i saw it in the theater while living in Paris a couple of years ago and fully enjoyed every moment of it. It was rated NC-16 over there. Just found out it is banned here! What hypocrisy. Pornography is legal, while art is banned? Everyone interested in the current degradation of the contemporary American family should see this film. Though extreme and at times absurd, parts of it are actually not so far fetched."
3,Ken Park - Larry Clark,"This is a unique movie, and not for everyone. If you like Larry Clark, for example, ""Kids"", and his stark reality, then you might get something out of this movie. But again, it is graphic, and blunt. I was sufficiently curious to see it that I bought the DVD. I'm satisfied. But dark stark reality."
1,Waste of money,"After reading some of the reviews I had pretty high hopes that I'd like this movie. Maybe I missed something, but I didn't feel like there was much of a point to the movie. Like another reviewer said, the female actors in the movie are all very attractive; however, every male in the film is scrawny, pale, with a less than attractive face. It made the sex scenes awkward and gross for some reason. If you watch the movie, be prepared to see quite a few penises too. I think the director was definitley going for the shock factor but I just found the movie to be repulsive and boring. Sadly, I feel I wasted my money and time on this movie."
1,One word...crap,"I'm all for disturbing scenes and nudity, but this film had absolutely no point. I've read other reviews that said it was about kids overcoming the odds. I didn't see it. It was all done to gain media attention. Thankfully, that did not happen. Do not waste your time watching this movie. Do not even watch it for free, unless you like underage sex scenes."
2,Got glitchy after 2 months,"Worked beautifully for the first two months, but lately it will stop playing a disc and say that it can't recognize it. Or it just won't load a disc that it's had no problem playing before. We're covered by warranty, but what a pain. This player should work for years without complaint, not months. Maybe we just got the one lemon. Lucky us. Went with the Panasonic for quality and brand familiarity (our plasma is a Panasonic) - Wish I had bought the ""Oppo"" OPDV971H DVD instead."
2,Nice look but lacks features.,"Another Made in China Sony product. Relatively good sound for the size but not enough power and as a result not enough volume. This is not a unit to party with.For the money one can buy a far better sounding shelf unit with multiple CD trays and a tape deck.Lacks a ""pause-resume"" function for the CD, clock and alarm features and batteries to make it portable. Radio tuning is not user friendly.I was glad the merchant took it back."
5,Sweet TV,"I love this TV, Everything works perfectly with my Comcast Digital Cable and Philips up-converting DVD player. The images are crisp, clear scenes. i don't have any issues with image stretching properly as I use the cable boxes feature that locks the output to only those that are fed into it and the TV just reproduces them as-is. I don't get some channels in wide screen and others being stretched to fill the whole screen but rather the black bars on the sides."
4,Glad I read the reviews before I made a purchase,I have been tracing my family history for almost 40 years. I thought my first edition of FTM (about 10 years old now) was the best ever. Then I began thinking about upgrades and almost bought the 2009 version. I'm glad I read the reviews first because I really like the Version 16 Essentials. It installed quickly and easily. The only thing I had to correct was to delete one of the short cuts on my desk top. I think this version will do me for another 10 years.
5,A First Order Work!,"This is one of the most interesting works that I have read. Gaiman's mastery of the English language, his creation of complex characters, and ability to weave stories throughout space and time is almost unmatched in recent years. This volume has aged well and had me catching my breath throughout."
2,Not very good reading experience,"First of all, you can't zoom in the pages, you can only go with the ""panel view"", it's main function is to allow a bigger panel while reading. In my humble opinion is not a very good system for reading this great graphic comic.Second, the panels that use two pages look weird in the screen, very small, and since you can't pinch to zoom in, it's very frustating, and ""The Doll's House"" uses a lot of unconventional panels.I recomend Comixology to read graphic novels."
1,reviewing,"I was really looking forward to watching both of theses movies I purchased. Though, within 15 mintues into ""Beloved"" it started freezing up on me. This went on until about the last 10 minutes of the movie it stopped. Then when I watched ""Thier Eyes Were Watching God"", same thing. So I didn't get to enjoy either one of the movies."
4,I prefer the book...,Their Eyes were Watching God that is. I cannot read Beloved but I love Their Eyes and prefer it to the movie. This was a good deal on a 2fer.
5,Fantastic,"I haven't played any other CD more than this one except for Quadrophenia by The Who and that was back when I was 17. I'm glad they invented CD's because I would have worn out the groves on an LP long ago. If I had to pick one CD to listen to for the rest of my life, this would be it. (Sorry Pete!)"
5,Sloppy Firsts,"""Sloppy Firsts"" is by far one of the greatest books I've ever read. Megan McCaffery has really outdone herself on this book. I read the entire book in less than a day. I couldn't put it down! The main character in the book, Jessica Darling, is one of the most relatable characters I've ever read about! I give this book 5 stars, as one of the best I've ever read."
4,Sloppy Firsts,"This is a great book for girls, especially those who are about to enter high school. It is filled with situations that any teen could face at any high school, which makes the book even better because the reader can relate. Jessica Darling, the main character is crushed when her best friend, Hope, moves away after the death of her brother. Jessica doesn't know what to do with herself and would rather have a miserable time in high school than try to make the best of it. She is faced with akward situations and some difficult decisions. The book is hard to put down because you want to know what happens next. Overall it is a great book and offers a glimps into the life of high school and a teenage girl."
4,Isn't She Darling?,"Jessica 'Notso' Darling is the witty, satirical narrator of this epistolary novel. Through a series of journal entries and wistful emails to her long distance BFF, we learn about Jessica's trials & tribulations as a high school student. From being labeled a 'brainiac', being the subject of a tell-all expose, and dashing her father's dreams of an Olympic athelete, Megan McCafferty tackles all of the teenage angst that some of us have experienced and others of us are just buckling into the seat on the rollercoaster.McCafferty has three more books in the Jessica Darling series, and I can't wait to see what's in store for her next!"
3,"Decent, but not a hall-of-famer","This book misses the mark in terms of realism. This debut (I think) is a noble endeavor on McCafferty's part; unfortunately, she doesn't know enough about teenage girls to produce compelling, multi-dimensional characters. Jessica Darling fails in her role as a YA-novel heroine. Quite simply, she has too much going for her: a 99.9 GPA, obnoxiously impressive (and overmentioned) athletic talent, the interest of an alluringly infamous older boy and a soul, too. If you liked Mia Thermopolis you'll likely grow to loathe Jess Darling. The ancillary characters are also poorly crafted. Even the shamelessly unrealistic Gossip Girl series manages to be more realistic than this.However, the lucitey characters aside, this book has many good points. The plot is amusing and the writing tight. Probably not worth $10, however."
2,just another adolescent book,"I read so many great reviews on this and saw it in numerous teen magazines that it seemed worth a try. but by the time i was nearly finished and my friend asked how it was, still nothing exciting had happened. it's a boring diary of an average teenage girl dealing with average problems in a very clique-y school where everyone has a label and all the girls care about are clothes and make up and boys. It could've been better if it had ended in a good way but even the ending felt like a roll of film run out. it just dribbled off to nothing. maybe worth reading, definitely not worth buying."
4,ummm yay!,"The book is good ..but.. I know it is missing something because I can't remember everything that happened. Jessica's trials with her parents and peers, as well as without her best friend are if anything enetertaining and completely believable. McCafferty hits a good point, that the move really is harder on Jessica than it would be on her friend because Jessica doesn't have a fresh start to establish herself. Good book. Heavy on the Drama and a little whiny."
4,Sloppy ... Ending.,"""Sloppy Firsts"" by Megan McCafferty is a light, fun read. I enjoyed the book up until the ending, which left me with a sour taste in my mouth. It ended with a lot of strings untied, and just kind of ruined the rest of the book for me. Up until the ending, it's a great read."
3,Not the best,"This book reminded me of a cross between two of my favorite novels-The Princess Diaries and Speak. Like the Princess Diaries, Sloppy Firsts is written like a diary. Like Speak, Jessica Darling is NOT having a happy life. However, The Princess Diaries and Speak are muche better books. Everyone in this book has parts when I couldn't stand them. And Jessica has bad thoughts about everything. This book wasn't very funny, but I couldn't stop reading, and I had to know what was going to happen. However, this book is really deppressing, and there are better books out there."
2,A good idea that went downhill,"Despite the rave reviews this book has been getting, I found the overall story not only unrealistic, but depressing to boot! I have friends that I stop talking to because they whine like Jessica Darling did, and by the middle of the book, I had to force myself to keep reading. If you want a real high school experience, check out ""Speak"" or ""Catalyst""."
4,interesting,"I found this book an easy read. It was probably directed at the average teenage reader. I found jessica to be a confused teen who delt with peer pressure, boys, and friends. This book is insiteful and a great laugh. I especially love how she is caught in between a mom who says she needs perspective and a dad who she feels she has nothing in common with. I liked how the author didn't make her most popular or the dorkiest of dorks. And how she is is torn between a lost friend who moved away, a non-caring ""clueless crew"", and an odd twist which enters the book at the end of sophmore year turning her into an experiment. Although, this book was an excellent read it didn't turn out how I expected it to. So in my opinionthe ending was horrible but my friends liked it..."
5,best book ever,This book is great. It got me to start reading again in high school and made me appreciate books. It is great for girls of any age. I especially like the modern aspect of it and how everything doesn't always turn out perfect.DON'T read the inside front flap because it will give away me favorite part of the book.
3,"""Sloppy Firsts""","Being a 14 year old girl, I could identify with Jessica Darling in this book. I feel the same frustration and worry she does, but this book just didn't do it for me. The author simply tried too hard to write like a teen would, in my opinion. The recent pop culture references fell flat, especially considering that most of them relate to 'flash-in-the-pan' fads.The cliques came off as over-exaggerated. Of course there are cliques and groups at my high school, but none are so blatantly obvious and territorial as these.The characters were often extremely annoying to me, as well, especially Jessica. She came off as too self-righteous, passing off almost everything and everyone as a waste of her time.All in all, I thought this book was okay. It can be hard to find a good book for my age group, so this one will do. I will probably read the sequel coming out in a few days, but this book certainly didn't make a dent in my favorite book list."
3,Good for a while.,It was doing pretty well until this week when the rubbing insulation started coming off from right by the connection to the converter. Pretty good for the price though.
1,An even futher dilution of the Tom Clancy brand...,"I really enjoy Tom Clancy's writing, and if you do too, then stay away from the book, because it's obvious he wasn't involved. The characters are uninteresting, and the plot is uninteresting at best, convoluted at worst. Even the title is a misnomer: There was barely a mention of the internet in the book. Even the topic of digital encryption, which can be fascinating when presented correctly, came off as just some political bickering. I feel like I've put up with these ""Created By"" books to fill the gap between *real* Tom Clancy books, but I couldn't even chalk this one up as a stop-gap measure. This one was just bad. Honestly, it felt like they came up with the computer game first, and then wrote the book second. This whole book didn't have nearly as much intrigue as one chapter of any ""Written by Tom Clancy"" book."
1,This book would make great kindling for your fire.,"A nice comparison for ruthless.com would be a pre-fabricated house. This book is boring and probably took less than a month to write. Trite dialouge, with a lot of techno-babble in between makes this the dullest, Clancy book yet. The characters are poorly developed as is the plot. Would somebody please bring back Jack Ryan? Even the OP-Center series were better than this book produced from a video game."
2,"Fair plot, slow ending.",As a fan of the early Tom Clancy I was again disappointed in his later works. Ruthless.com has a fair plot but with too many characters to really follow. Clancy fails to develop most of the characaters thus keeping the reader from becoming attached to them and not really caring what happens to them. I was slightly intrigued by the plot until it fell apart at the end leaving me wondering why I didn't follow my first hunch and leave it sitting on the bookstore shelf.
1,FAILURE!!!!!,"I am a fan of Clancy, but this book was so boring and the ending was so obvious. I was on a trip and had only brought this book so I was trapped. I will give Clancy another chance, but maybe he should slow down and spend more time on his books."
1,Too many good books out there to bother with this one,"Being a huge Tom Clancy fan, I expected to enjoy this book, but I got halfway through and couldn't finish. There are so many better ways I could spend my time! This book is terrible!! The quality of writing is very poor; you won't become attached to the characters and you probably won't even be able to follow the dull storyline very well. There are many typos, more than I've ever seen in a ""bestseller"" book. Please don't bother with this one."
2,It was OK just OK nothing more,It was kind of like watching a movie that was somewhat entertaining. It was OK nothing more nothing less. The plot skipped around a lot. Had some characters that were developed and used throughout the entire book. The ending was better than I expected. I think it would make a much better movie than a book. Tough to build tension in a business environment with characters that are supposed to be professional and distanced from their emotions. Their motivations were evident just not that believable or compelling.
1,Wanna know the meaning of an absolutely boring book?,Absolutely boring. Does tom Clancy really write like this...
5,Paloma Picasso EDT,This is my favorite fragrance which has become hard to find. This seller provided exactly what I wanted quickly and was easy to order from.
4,Ready to roll!,"I wanted to get a pair of skates to see if I may eventually be good enough to do roller derby. I didn't want to spend too much money on my first pair of skates, so these were definitely affordable. They are comfortable and feel light on your feet. I think these skates are perfect for skating for fun and practicing your moves. They probably aren't designed for serious roller derby play, but I am not at that skill level yet."
5,One of my faves!,"This book really started my love for the whole series! I had this book for about a year now and I still reread it time and time again. And every time I do it still holds a top position in my list of faves. Anyway the book revolves around a girl named Zoey who is strangely attracted to a boy named Lucas. The thing is that he (as in Lucas) is supposedly the murderer of her boyfriend Jakes brother Wade. Lucas has just come from Youth Authority paying for his crime. And the one person he thought about those two years was Zoey! So when he gets back sparks fly between him Jake which makes it hard for Zoey, because she has so many run-ins with Lucas she feels she's starting to care for him. But in the end she does come to a decision between the two. And personally I think she made the right choice! Buy the book because this review doesnt even BEGIN to describe how good the book is! ..."
5,Tsk Tsk Zoey,"The book, ""Zoey Fools Around"" Is a begining of a great series. Believe me I've read every book. This story is all about Zoey Passmore who has a wonderful love life with her great boyfriend Jake. Then she meets Lucas who has recently come back from the YA (a jail for teenagers) and she becomes closer and closer to him. Everybody else hates Lucas including Zoey's cool best friend, Nina Geiger and Nina's sister Claire (Who was a victim of the crime Lucas commited) and everybody else Zoey is close to! What will Zoey do? This book is cool, cheap, and well, just plain well written! So go ahead, buy it!"
4,One to watch again and again,"This is a performance, not a ""How To"" video, but for those of us who enjoy Argentine tango, it's a delight to study the steps and decide which can be incorporated into our own repetoire. The camerawork is not tricky, and almost always shows the entire dancer. The lighting for the performance, however, was ""theatrical"", meaning a bit dark. If the men are in dark trousers, it is difficult to see what their feet are doing. After watching Sally Potter's ""The Tango Lesson"", it was fun to see both Gustavo Naveira and Fabian Salas (who played Pablo Veron's friends in the movie) performing in this video. There is a wide range of tango, from dramatic to acrobatic, from simple and lyric to comic. Pricey as videos go, but much cheaper than a trip to Buenos Aires to see the best tango dancers in the world."
4,Wishing for more ...,"I wish this video had more light, so that all the beautiful dances could be seen in all its glory. I wish this video had more performances by those sensational dancers. I wish I could dance like that .... I wish ..."
1,Very bad quality,The lightening is bad and the performances are not very good. I would recommend Daniel Trenner's Series of video tapes for serious tango learners. Where you can really see instruction and performances of high quality.
4,Very Close to Pure Heaven,"I had no idea what this movie was all about, but I was beyond pleased to buy it, view it, and add it to me collection of greats and re-viewables. Is it a believable story? Probably not, but it's a spellbinding tale, full of the stuff that we want to see."
4,Submit and be redeemed!,"Viewers familiar with 'Run Lola Run' and 'The Princess and the Warrior' will enjoy this film that came and went with barely a trace in the 'plexes. Beautifully shot, well acted and directed with the simplicity that comes with a specific mastery of the medium, this is well worth purchasing. The DVD has an excellent picture and the director always conjures up a better than average commentary, if you like that as an extra feature. Another poetic, absorbing film from Tom Tykwer."
2,Thelma and Luigi,"When a film compels an audience with three dimensional characters, an interesting story, and honest emotion, we're ready to listen to whatever ""message"" the filmmaker wants to send us. When the film, however, is ALL about the message, I hear nothing, and I refuse to listen. Such is the case with Heaven, a beautifully shot film that is also one of the most pretentious films to come out this year. It opens with a view of rolling hills from a virtual helicopter, with boxy, pixillated trees and clouds, and the ""pilot"" asking how high he can go. That's a perfect metaphor for this virtual ""film,"" with its boxy unreal characters doing silly, unlikeable, unbelievable things in order to support the heavy-handed symbolism the filmmakers cram down the viewers throat. If Hollywood is often guilty of gratuitous sex and violence, Heaven rates a triple X in pretension. And if this is Heaven, I can only imagine how it will look in Hell."
5,Hats off for Red Hat,"I am a long time Linux user and this so far the best release byRed Hat.Installing is a breeze, desktop is very nice. Default install mostfeatures for average user. You can add more programs later thrupackage manager, which is very easy to use.Updating the system is easy with ""up2date"", which notified you whenupdates are available. OpenOffice works like a charm.For advanced power users there is tons of tools for programming,editing, developing etc.Burning CD's and DVD's is easy as click and drag.For photo editing users there is a GIMP, very powerful editingsoftware.My system is running very fast and stable with this Red Hat release. I did not have one single crash yet since I installed itin Nov-2003.If someone is looking for alternative operating system, this onedeserves to try."
1,No software is available,"After purchasing this software I quickly found outthat you are your own 'support' person. If someapplication does not work, then you have to searchon the internet, or user forum. I don't know aboutyou but I do NOT trust complete strangers on theinternet. It is like inviting someone into yourhouse you don't know. If you want to use Adobe youcan forget it because they do not make any softwarefor Linux. And several other popular Windows apps thatare not there. So in the end I wound up buying a MAC, atleast there is software available and MS Office!"
2,Blower Motor harness for 2002 Hyundai Sonata,"Ordered and received in a timely function. However, Trumark/site needs to update the photo utilized to represent the product since the motor did not have a pigtail connector attached so the wires/contacts were hanging free. Second, the Hyundai Sonata 2002 model blower motor has a plastic tube that connects to the air spout: the ordered part did not come with a replacement plastic tube AND the size of the opening was way smaller than the original. We had to makeshift and create a seal around the spout to ensure it would fit.Reflection? Part is cheap but when it is not indicative of what is being advertised online via pictures, they need to be responsible and update the site. Would I order from them again? Doubt it."
5,So Encouraging,"I have watched this video series about 3 times and each time I am encouraged to keep on chasing the dream that The Dream Giver has given me. Bruce Wilkinson is a fabulous teacher. God created each of us for a purpose, and He has a plan for us to fulfill that purpose. Sometimes the journey is long and treacherous, but always well worth the effort. If you want to find out where you are on your quest, watch this video series and read the book. The Dream is worth everything to fulfill. Great teaching series!"
2,Uninspired,"A big fan of all these musicians, so I'm picking up a few CD's I don't have..... The playing on this CD is very mechanical, just going through the motions. It will go into the rack of CD's and likely never get played again."
3,"Great Blankets, but Small for Swaddling","I love the patterns on these blankets and they are very soft; however, they are not very good for swaddling the baby (my baby was 7 pounds) as they are on the smaller side. I also bought similar blankets from Babies R Us (available online also) by Carter's in a four-pack and they are larger, a bit thicker, and MUCH better for swaddling and wrapping the baby!"
5,Sisters of China,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00019GHF2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgMy husband bought this from Amazon, and tonight we watched it. If you have some knowledge of Chinese history, this is a feast. My husband has two degrees in Chinese history, and he deems it highly accurate. Beyond that, it is a visual feast, in that action and color are used to their greatest advantage, so that the term ""moving picture"" is accurate as it rarely is.We will recommend this to all our friends who have an interest in China in the twentieth century."
1,Strait Disappointment,"Probably the biggest George Strait fan there is, I almost died when I listened to this recording. He strays so far away from country that it's hard to call it country at all. I had faith in old George, though, and he made a strong comeback with Always Never The Same. There isn't a bad track on it, and I hope it will produce many more greatest hits for him."
5,His best to date,"This has to rank as one of George Strait's best albums I have heard. track 6, ""we shouldn't be doin this"" has got to be his next big hit.."
5,excellent thriller,"One of the best after the bomb books I have read. I have two copies and they go nowhere. My two end on a happy note, but my daughter has a copy that has an extra page and a half that has a sad ending. Anyone know where I can get a copy with that ending?"
5,Riveting,"Like a lot of you that also reviewed this book, I read it first years ago, then lost it and eventually re-ordered a new copy two years ago. I just re-read it. It is an amazingly good read, but I was astonished to see that my new paperback had a different (and happy) ending ???) what gives???? - please feel free to email me if you know what happened to the original ( and shocking) ending as I'm completely dumbfounded. Don't they realise that the shock ending was what kept you remembering this great book ???"
3,pingpong players,"this is a good product but,if i had known using a top off a $100.00 table would have worked i could've saved alot of money."
2,Misleading,"The picture of the product shown online is misleading. It appears that it will fit on a standard size pool table but it is actually three inches too narrow. Additionally, it shows a frame attached to fit inside the table to raise the table platform above the pool table rails. Only the table is provided. The shipping was free and arrived within a week."
2,So-so,"Although the product itself is satisfactory, the shipper used by this seller is absolutely unacceptable. Consider ordering from a local dealer; ordering online will cost a fortune!"
1,Won't work on Windows XP,"The drivers do not work correctly on Windows XP. The web site listed in the manual to download updated drivers is no longer working, the site has disappeared.AVOID THIS ITEM!!"
4,A great looking case for the Treo But?,"This is a great looking case and fits my Treo very well. However I did notice a couple of flaws in the design. If you use a plug in earpiece or headphone set, it keeps popping out, I had to cut a piece of the leather away so that my plug in would fit without popping out. Also the slot for credit cards is very tight and actually my cards would not fit in it because of the tightness. Also I would suspect that no more than one card could fit in it. The swivel kit is excellent and the leather attachment for the belt is excellent as it prevents my belts from getting scratched."
4,origonal equipment for the traxxas ezstart,This is the original wiring harness for the traxxas ezstart..i tried a couple of times to make my own and out of frustration gave up and purchased the harness made by traxxas.
5,Just got back from a 1500-mile trip...great product!,"I just drove from Detroit to Baltimore and back, and the Garmin StreetPilot i2 was a lifesaver. My girlfriend had an interview for graduate school and I had plenty of places to go, and we were staying with some family friends. Rather than print out Mapquest directions for each destination, we just hopped in the car and used the Garmin.We wanted to find a Metro station to go into D.C., so my girlfriend typed in the name of the station, and the Garmin found it and directed us right to it. The turn-by-turn voice prompts are ultra-helpful, and the bright screen is great, even at night.Even on the tangled highways in the D.C. area (we were on the Beltway at 7:30 a.m. on a Monday morning), the Garmin got us to our destinations without a single wrong turn. This unit basically saved our trip (and our sanity). It was well worth the money I paid for it."
4,Garmin StreetPilot i2 Vehicle Navigation GPS System,"Good economical GPS unit; easy to use; in residential areas, doesn't always pick the quickest route (ie. not the route with fewest stop signs); be careful when using the suction cup on the windshield as it will fall when the glass temperature changes"
5,Absolutely the best....,"This little gadget is amazing. I am so glad I bought this for my husband for Father's Day. I think I'm gonna buy one for myself or make him share it with me.We just got back from a road trip from Alabama to Michigan last weekend and this GPS system worked PERFECT! It was great to know our arrival time and how many miles to when directions changed. It took us right to our uncles driveway. The directions were never wrong and there were plenty of opportunities for it to get confussed to lead us in the wrong direction, but it didn't. We even use it around town playing with it and have found better ways of getting around town to the normal places we go.I can not say enough about this GPS system. We are so impressed with it and have shown it to all of our friends & family for them to buy one too."
3,Great little GPS at super price,"No frills or extras, small screen, but great proce and meets my needs for a basic navigator."
3,"Help, please.","I have been looking for an MP3 player to replace my Sony D-CJ01 for quite a while. I've always been a big Sony fan, but due to problems and a shorter than expected life of my D-CJ01, I'm a little leary to spend this kind of money on another Sony player. There doesn't seem to be much good competition out there with the features I'm looking for, so if you own one of these would you please write a review, or e-mail me with your thoughts on this model. Let's face it, with a warranty of 1 year on parts, & 90 days on labor, if you have a problem you know they're gonna rape you on the labor charge, so it's really a 90 day warranty. I found this out the hard way. I'm also a little disappointed that the SonicStage software isn't Mac compatible, but do I really need it to play MP3's? 3 stars because I'm neutral for now."
3,"Everville, Starts off slow but picks up","Everville, what can you say about this book? As I said it starts out slow during the epilogue but as familiar characters are introduced the novel gains speed at an alarming rate. A good novel but as with any sequel the first is always better."
2,Super Reader,"Didn't really enjoy this at all, compared to the other Barker books. This is pretty much when I stopped reading him, in general. A quite disappointing book after the other work I had enjoyed reading in the past. Hard to put the figure on quite why, but it could well be that there are just not enough monsters."
1,The worst horror story I've ever read,"This book was a major disappointment. It gets one star, just because there is no 0 star option. The plot is dull, the characters weak and the horror scenes can't scare even a little kid. Although the parallel worlds idea is intriguing, Barker only utilizes it superficially and wasting the potential of making a great story. It is a mediocre book overall and I strongly discourage anyone from buying it."
1,my opinion,"no offense but everytime i read a book about a hero sleeping with someone else that isnt the heroinne and seeing him enjoy it really turns my stomach, besides if sam or whatever his name is didnt feel anything for tina why did he say her name every darn other page, he even thought she was the best person hes ever slept with, he should of just left the other girl he was interested in find a better man..."
4,Playa's Handbook,I enjoyed reading this book and has told many of friends about it as well. I have always enjoyed Brenda Jackson writing and the way she can tell one story and weave another one in that is sure to be another book.I always look for the next book to see what is happening with her characters.I recommend this book to everyone who enjoys a good love story.
3,Good Solid Work,"For some reason, as the money came in, the quality decreased with Robert Rodriguez's Mexico Trilogy (Robert Rodriguez Mexico Trilogy (El Mariachi / Desperado / Once Upon A Time In Mexico)). The first is still the best. The second one is pretty good too. But this one is missing something. Something that made the first two such a novelty.The strong cast does everything in their power to carry this movie, especially the new addition Johnny Depp. It's got an interesting premise, but the execution seems to be the problem. It's still quite fun to watch.This DVD features a commentary with Robert Rodriguez, deleted scenes, a few featurettes detailing the picture's production, and a 10 minute film school with Rodriguez.Recommended."
1,A Horrible Movie,This movie only confirms that Antonio Banderas is one of the most consistently atrocious actors. Depp is the only reason it gets a star at all... Thank God I only rented this for 3 bucks rather than spending 8 plus snacks in the theater. A God-Awful movie...
5,Great follow-up,"The director did a great job on this film and I loved the way it was layed out, great gunfights and I like how the director made it his own, these movies are no copies of john woo, no disrespect to him of cource but it wasnt."
4,A good movie with an extra special extra for food lovers.,"How often do you hear someone say they bought a movie for a recipe? Well I did with this one. Don't get me wrong, the movie is good but one of the extras is entitled ""cooking school"" and it details how to make the center piece dish for Depp in the movie, Pibil. It is a bomb arse dish. If you like a little spicy then you have got to try it. I haven't found it in any Mexican restaurants locally so I had to give it a go. The director runs you through the entire process and if you can watch that without wanting to go out and make it then I think you're nuts."
2,another one for the trash......save your money..rent it.....,"This movie goes way left from the Desperado plot and is not a worth while investment to anyone's collection. Some good action scenes, I give it that....but it doesn't make a entire movie without a decent plot...."
1,What the h*** was the plot of this movie????,"What the heck was Robert Rodriguez thinking when he made this awful movie? He is a usually pretty reliable, but this movie mad absolutely zero sense. There were way to many characters, and there was no character development at all. I didn't even know a lot of the character names until the credits ran. And by that time, I didn't really care.Some of the actions set pieces were fantastic, but they had nothing to do with the plot, what ever the plot was.DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO RENT IT! Save your money"
1,Will not play,I can't even watch this. It starts off with no sound and only last about 30 seconds and then states that my bandwidth is too low. Which isn't a problem when I watch other movies. I don't know why it's only THIS movie that won't play.
4,The Sum of Its Influences,"Pretty decent in a comic booky sort of way. Director Rodriguez wants to be Quentin Tarantino, and that influence shows, as does his admiration for Sergio Leone. Unfortunately, Rodrigeuz doesn't have Tarantino's wit, and Antonio Banderas is no Clint Eastwood. For me, Johnny Depp made the fim as Agent Sands. Depp plays such a good edgy psycho. I think he's the best character actor around today."
1,Dreadful,"This is the sort of movie you and your friends might make on a long weekend, assuming someone was silly enough to give you millions of dollars to do so. But, when you're a famous director this is exactly what happens. Good actors are wasted on a plot that lurches from one gun fight to the next. I suppose, if pressed to say something nice I will say that the way color is used in this movie is excellent but there is literally nothing else to recommend."
2,Stick with SPY KIDS...the kids are easier to fool!,"Robert Rodriguez missed this one by a mile. The action is of the everyday action movie affair. The plot is a rambling collage to give a reason for another action scene. Antonio Banderas and Johnny Depp are great, but not superhero enough to save this mess. Desperado was just plain cool, even original at times. Maybe Desperado will be remembered as the one that Rodriguez got right. Once Upon a Time in Mexico will be remembered as the one he made instead of fooling the kids one more time with Spy Kids 4!"
3,violence adventure,"Once upon a Time in Mexico is an exciting adventure movie withAntonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, and Johnny Depp. However, this movie has a lot vulgar language and violence."
2,Script?,"Someone did not read the final version of this script. They began shooting hoping the writer would have it together half way through. No such luck.This is one of those films where the actors were offered so much money, they couldn't resist this piece of junk."
1,Another zero star film from Rodriguez,"I really enjoyed El Mariachi. I don't understand the reviewers here who thought Desperado was good - I gave Desperado one star beause zero stars is not an option.Once Upon a Time In Mexico is the same recipe as Desperado: poor writing, poor acting, and poor execution. This is the type of movie that you throw in the trash rather than donate to a book sale, simply because it is inhumane to subject people to this film."
3,Am I missing something?,This was a mess of a movie! The story was wishy washy and the plot was dull. The action was what makes this movie worth watching. Some downright chezzy action scenes make for a good laugh. If I had to recommend one Robert Rodriguez flick I would rate From Dusk Till Dawn much better.
2,Once Upon A Time in Mexico,"Don't rent this movie if1. You think it may be as good as Desperado, or2. If you intend to watch Salma Hayek because she is only in the movie for 10 minutes at the most, or3. To be entertained.Movie is slow, boring, and action scenes are too far fetched and ridiculous, and eventually become stupid after a while.This movie was a complete disappointment and flop!! Do not waste your time on this movie!2 out of 5 stars or 4/10 at best."
3,bird sounds with music,This is a nature CD that has soft music with the sounds of chirping birds in the background. Soothing and relaxing for studying and reading. Wish it was bird sound only though.
1,"Don't Buy, Died on me","I purchased one of these 6 months ago. As I was watching my TV power suddenly went away. I thought it was a surge or a breaker, but to my suprise this unit just stoped allowing power through. I tried to reset, and every thing else. No lightes are on, it is just DEAD.I cannot reccomend a product that will die with no warning."
4,A Good Surge Protector,"So far I am completely satisfied with this product. The outlets are spaced out nicely to accommodate large power bricks. As other reviewers have stated, the safety shutters make it difficult to plug and unplug things, but it isn't a problem as long as the unit isn't in an awkward position. The joule rating is very high for the relatively low price. The swiveling power cable is convenient for placing the unit while keeping the cable out of the way. Finally, although I have a very untrained eye, I didn't notice any loss of picture quality when running coax cable through the unit to my Samsung HL-S5087W television."
2,Hard to plug stuff in.,"I bought tthis item to replace my Belkin UPS that died. It is VERY hard to plug anything into these outlets because it has some type of ""child protection."" Next time I'll have to test one out before buying it."
1,"If you are going to use Coaxial cable protection, don't buy this one","I bought this one for its coaxial cable protection function, but the result is terrible. It greatly degrades the signal. When I use it with TV, the program on TV became unclear. When I use it with computer, the high-speed internet kept dropping.I intended to return it to Amazon, and I found Amazon's return policy is that only partial refund for opened products. How can I know it's dysfunctional before I destroyed the package and used it? In the future, I only buy stuff at online stores with local stores, such as bestbuy or circuit city, so that I can easily get refund."
3,"Works well, however...","For some reason it is EXTREMELY hard to get the plugs into their sockets. It's almost like the slots have a hard plastic cover inside the sockets. Anyway, you really have to work to find the right angle to get the plugs inserted without breaking something inside the outlet. Once the plugs are in, they'll stay in. The 11 outlet design is very handy though and really allowed me to clean up the rats nest of plugs and outlet bars."
3,"Good for student, but not for real beginner","My boyfriend is Czech, and his mother was coming down to visit us, so I thought it would be a wonderful idea to learn the language before she got here. I bought this book in order to aide me in that mission. It didn't work. I was more confused than anything, and my boyfriend said most of that language was wrong. There are too many dialects of Czech in the small country to compose it within one book. He's Moravian and he would help me speak Czech, but he couldn't do it from the book when he explained to me what the words really meant. Czech isnt easy to learn anyway, but this book wasn't as helpful as I thought it would be."
5,The utility man of your toolbox,"What a great little tool! Though I wouldn't use it for big jobs, it is an extremely versatile tool to manage all your small projects around the house. I've already used it to cut through wood & drywall to install outlets in my basement and used another attachement to easily saw through metal.At its highest setting, it will give you an earful, so be sure to wear protective gear (ear & eye protection). And it won't cut very deep, so anything over 1 1/2"", use something else. But for anything else, this Dremel tool is a time-saver.Like every new tool, it will take a little while to get used to it, but once you do, you may find yourself going out of your way to use this little wonder."
1,Dremel 400 Up in smoke,"I am going to echo what many others have said. I have used my 400 xpr reasonably for a year maybe once a month. Today I was cutting with it, making sure the vents were clear because I know it can get warm, when it started making an arc welding type of noise and smoke began spewing out. I stopped it and although it was not hot at all, I waited a bit and tried again. It went click, click zap, zap, zap and began smoking like rubber in a bonfire. Fortunately I was out in my shed with lots of ventilation. I am disappointed in this Dremel product. I will try a different brand from now on."
1,"A toy, not a tool.",Mine melted like everyone elses. Good for polishing coins and that's about it.I'll never buy another Dremel toy again.
5,Three years old and still going,Got my 400xpr at Lowes about three years ago. I also have the router table and plunge router accessories. Some have pretty well said the 400xpr is nothing but junk. I totally disagree with that. I have used mine for just about every job imaginable. It has got a little to hot a few times. I learned it's limits and it is a great tool for what it is designed for. Yesterday I ordered a 4000. I build a lot of birdhouses so I'll just leave the xpr setup as a plunge router.
1,Not worth it,We bought the take and toss 5 pack with straws. You get what you pay for. Three of the cups were stuck together ridiculously tight. After trying all manner of comical efforts to separate the cups we resorted to channel lock pliers. We managed to salvage three out of the five cups.
2,Strange mix of colors,"The Take & Toss cups are generally good and we like them. But this 5-pack is bad for a few reasons. First, the colored cups make it impossible to know what's in the cup: water, juice or milk? Second, the colors are actually pretty ugly.Finally, First Years annoyingly does not include a cup and cap in each of the five colors.My 5-pack contained:2 green cups2 blue cups1 yellow cup, 1 yellow top2 red tops2 orange topsIf you look closely at the product images and keep in mind that the five cups are on the bottom, with the five caps on top, you'll notice that they have the same problem: 2 cups in color A, 2 cups in color B, 1 cup and 1 top in color C, 2 tops in color D, and 2 tops in color E.It's just strange and lazy. Makes no sense at all. But even if you can get past this, just get the clear Take & Toss cups."
3,Hard to tell if it works/works better in small space,"I bought four of these ionic air purifiers due to the above average reviews of them. So far I cannot really tell how well they are working. In the first month, they generates some really funny smell (like old burning oil) probably due to the ozone it emitted. Had to unplug some of them due to strong smell. They seem to work better after a while, especially in small bathrooms and in the kitchen. Better not to put them close to where people often stay (like living room). Do not believe the ozone is good for you. Keep cleaning the metal strips, they are not real dirty but seem to work better if you clean them often. Like the fact that an extra strip comes with each air ionizer. Do believe if you want to clean up a large area, you may be better off to get an Oreck air cleaner or a Honeywell hepa air cleaner. Sears has a plasma air cleaner (with both ion and cation) that seems to smell much better but is very expensive."
3,It helps,"It works good enough for a SMALL space, my bedroom is small, but this unit does almost nothing for a large room, what it does seem to do is reduce dust on surfaces, I do not have to dust as often and I credit this unit, I also bought it to reduce airborne bacteria and I am hoping that it gives me a little protection in flu season, (wishful thinking). I recommend it."
3,"Decent, but...","I have started to read this book (Ch. 5) and from what I have seen so far, the book is alright but it has no examples or exercises!!! I think that practical experiences is especially important when learning any computer related skill whether be programming, graphics, or whatever. In my opinion, reading an entire computer book is worthless unless you get some actual practice and not having any hands on material in this book really hurts its quality."
3,An enjoyable story of a possible future disaster,"First of all, this is a light, but interesting story about an asteroid heading straight for earth. By light, I mean not a bloated, boring look at all the technological aspects of such a story. I like Clarke for his ""hard"" science fiction. I also like his concise style. I thought some of the background on the main character was a bit dull, but I agree that the second half is more interesting. I was also hoping for more on the environmental effects of such an encounter with an asteroid, but all in all it's still a worthwhile read."
3,whats going on???,"I have a few large problems with this book. One, the length too short the story gets started well is kinda hazy in the middle and picks up strong agian in the end. The secound problem is that I am not quite sure what this book is. Is it the life of a family in the 23rd cenutry? A book of an impendeing asteriod impact? How about a book of a new war of religions? The end result is that you just don't know by the end. If you don't like the style you could walk away feeling confussed and fustrated."
2,One of Clarke's worst,"This reads like the notes for a novel, instead of the novel itself. Large type and lots of unnecessary ""book sections"" with long passages taken from other authors are filler for what should have been a short story. Clarke seems disorganized and scattershot in this book, tying together a lot of unrelated things to attempt to fill out a story. Anytime any bit of tension is built up he deflates it nearly immediately. The prose is particularly uninspired and in an absolutely bizarre instance he spends a chapter describing a signal from an alien intelligence, ""proving the existence of extra-terrestrial intelligence"" only to never mention it again. At many points he brings up interesting moral and ethical quandries to never address them, something Clarke would have never done in earlier work. Clarke never once engaged me for me than a page or two. This is the worst piece of writing I've ever read by him."
2,Not Clarke's best effort,"I just read this thing, and I was very disappointed. He spends too much time on perdictions for the future, mundane minutia that takes up paragraphs at a time and slows the story to a frerakin' crawl. The thing jumps from the main character's old age to childhood to adulthood, with peripheral mentions of families he supposedly loves, but loses due to cicumstances that aren't really made clear, so you don't get a taste of his reaction. In short, you really never get to know the main character, you're just supposed to sit back and be in awe of Clarke's futuristic predictions, many of which are old news at this point. Pick one of hos other books, if you're gonna read Clarke."
3,Old Movies Are Like Old Friends,"I don't recall seeing this movie in the past. However, as the story unfolds the actors come out of your memory. You'll think ""Oh gosh, that's Jingles...."" Or ""Look, it's James Arness!""The story is good, the filming was great. Photographing those old planes must have been very difficult. The cameras were large and heavy, the snow made it difficult.... Some people might think the old planes are the real stars of this movie.John Wayne did some good acting; very believable. It was a movie based on a real story. It was a rest to NOT hear foul language."
2,"Dated, mostly boring 1950s aviation search and rescue film","""Island In The Sky"" tells the story of a crew - led by John Wayne - whose plane goes down in icy Labrador. The crew must try and survive under tough conditions meanwhile a search and rescue is mounted - but will they make it in time? Sounds like an interesting plot doesn't it? Sadly, ""Island In The Sky"" is corny, cliched, and artificial even by early 1950s Hollywood standards. The action is ho-hum and we don't really get to care about any of these characters. Long and boring. The heavy-handed religious references (that includes the musical score) also become somewhat tiresome. Wayne is OK."
1,Picture is not what you get.,I bought this because it showed that you would get one 8inch by 10inch filter.That is what i wanted to fit my Boodabox.What you get is the small Boodaloo filters.Not what i needed.No truth in advertising here.
1,dont buy,as other reviews have said the audio quality is slightly below what you would expect from a knock off bought out of the back of a van for a buck while your friends look out for the cops.
5,"Sleek, sexy, and sophisticated","First heard this album at a friend's house. I'm no fan of jazz. But I had to get this recording. Makes me think of looking out my window on a lonely, rainy New York Saturday night."
2,Good in theory....,"I do much of the attatched parenting method. We breastfeed, cosleep some of the time, wear our baby, and respond immediately to cries. At four months old, my baby was still getting up every hour and a half. I couldn't do it anymore. These techniques are great if your baby is sleeping for three hour stretches, but for us, having a baby that was up every hour or so was getting to be too much. We did two nights of crying it out and we now have a baby that sleeps. He is happy, well-rested and an absolute joy. Heaven!"
5,Very Memorable,"Mr McCaffery, my 6th grade teacher, gave us creative writing assignments using this book. He copied the pictures, let us chose between four and told us we had to incorporate the sentence given somewhere in the story. I loved that assignment which helped inspire me to find the enjoyment of writing. However I could never remember the title/author of that book. Now, nearly 15 years later, I was extremely excited when I stumbled upon it by accident and without hesitation bought it. For young or old, this book is absolutely amazing and it will stimulate the imagination and storyteller in all of us. It's a must have for those with kids or for those of us who simply need a journey to a world we have forgotten..."
5,This a great and interesting book!,"I have been writing stories for these illistrations since I was in 4th grade (a requierment for school) and this year it is on ""Another Place, Another time"". It must be the best story I ever wrote! Thank you Chris Van Allsburg and Harris Burdick!!"
5,Must have,This is a must have for elementary teachers. The visuals are amazing and are great for prewriting. We used this for third grade.
4,Stories for the Imagination,"The Mysteries of Harris Burdick is an intriguing book that captures the mind of any viewer. The black and white pictures and short captions at the bottom of each picture make the mind wonder to far off places. Each picture depicts any number of situations that the imagination is allowed to create. Small children may take pleasure from looking at the pictures, but people of any age can enjoy the mind boggling experience from the book. The pictures can be used as a teaching aide to children in elementary and high schools alike. No matter what age you are, The Mysteries of Harris Burdick is well worth the effort."
5,Great Seasonal Fix For Drafts,"This is a great product to stop drafts yet it still lets you open your windows when warm weather returns.My condo faces a lakeshore and whenever the wind would get up over 20 mph, the windows would howl like something from an old horror movie. Our condo complex will be replacing these windows in the next year or two so, until then, this has proven a great way to stop the drafts and noise while still allowing me to easily remove the product in the summer so I can open the windows.The only downside to Seal 'n Peel is the odor when you first apply it. It's much like airplane glue. Apply the product on the outside if you can. If not, do it on a day when you can leave a couple of doors open for most of the day.Shipping from BIC was fast. My order arrived in three days."
2,Beware the fumes!,"Read what others have posted. I checked in on the product right after I bought and applied it to two windows. It is the worst smelling stuff to ever come out of a caulk gun. Reminds me of plastic model cement, and the dose is huge!I saw that the stuff works great for what it is intented for, sealing cracks, but after an hour, I had to remove it. I wasn't going to endure a couple days of curing for my health. Please, use adequate ventilation, and don't make the same mistake I did in applying it during the winter."
2,Too small...,"I bought this for a 90 Montero- wouldn't fit. I also tried it on my 99 Explorer- wouldn't fit. I then tried it on my 08 Silverado- surprise...it wouldn't fit. If you own a small car, you may have luck. Good quality."
2,"Low price, low performance","1. Set-up took about 3 hours with a friend2. Table could never perfectly balance (got 3 out of 4 side pockets to function correctly)3. Cheap construction including deformed feet, excess glue on pieces, and scratched surfaces4. Worst of all, the surface is not felt and is excessively smooth. Balls roll forever, and the roll sounds like rolling a ball across a wooden floor. I ended up rigging a felt top by gluing a piece of felt on top, but in the end I looked at the deformity and decided to get my money back."
4,Better than Expected,My husband loved this jacket and it is better than I truly expected. The feel is soft and the look is more than just casual.
2,Not up to WMF standards,I recently bought an espresso machine and wanted this for frothing milk. The item arrived with the handle bent of place. It was not secured well to the body of the pitcher. I had to return it due to poor quality.Still on the lookout for a good frothing pitcher.
1,Out takes?,"This is strictly a curiosity item for the musicologist. It consists of one minute, highly repetitive phrases: basically Morrison fooling around with mini ideas. there is nothing memorable om the album though one can see links to later songs. The self-deprecating titles are a bit odd. I feel like a sucker for buying this on his name alone."
1,"TINY, CHEAPLY MADE, CAT CHOKED","these were TINY and made out of very lightweight plastic. i gave one to my cat and in under a minute, she had chewed off the ball tip and was choking. STAY AWAY."
3,Cool idea that loses steam,"I loved the idea of a PI working in Lembo, and bought the book souly on that. Sadly the plot moves really slow and seems unfocused with the two cases that they were following. It was always more interesting when they were talking about being dead and haunting things then anything else. Also I felt that the POV of the detective was a bit over done in the noir style. Still a great consept that would work again, with maybe a single case."
2,"Not Bad, But....","The book was very insightful, but you can't help but get the feeling that they are not telling you everything. Understandably Kaplan reserves most of its secrets for its much more intensive prep courses. However, if you like Kaplan's methods you may like this book, but if you are really serious about making a high score you might want to consider other more thorough study guides."
4,Serviceable at the right price,"I use these cables in a home recording studio with Frontier Design, Yamaha, and RME ADAT hardware. Works fine, and at a length that works for my sprawling setup."
1,Wrong size,"This kickstand was way too small for my son's bike. I compared his bike to about a dozen others in the neighborhood when the kids were all riding around and it would not have fit on any of the 20 inch bikes I saw. The kickstand was at least 2 inches too short so the bike just falls over. I held it up to a 16 inch bike and it would have been perfect. I believe they sent the incorrect size but there is no packaging so no way to tell. It would be very nice if there were dimensions included. It's not like that would be a hard thing to produce. They are a certain length, just tell us which one is which length. Because they don't provide this information I have no way to know if the kickstand just doesn't fit any of these bikes or if I received the wrong one.On the plus side, it seems well built."
5,Mine worked great,"This worked great on my old 26"" bike, so I do not represent those who had problems with shorter bikes. The bolt was not long enough to fit my other 26"" Diamondback bike which has a funky plate in place. I was tired of the ""adjustable"" kickstands since we have snapped off two of them at the joint in the last two years. Next time I WILL do a video review."
1,wrong size,"The 16"" version of this kickstand was way too small (at least 2"" short) for my son's 16"" bike. There was no packaging, so there's no way to know, but it was likely a 12"" kickstand. The vendor denies this and doesn't cover return shipping, so I'm stuck with it"
3,A Visit to an English Mansion,I love this book. As we enter the gates of Hickyacket Hall we know something is odd. But then as your family members get carried off by colourful monsters one by one you realize that this isn't your average mid-fall family outing. Infact it's a horrible disaster part Agatha Christie and part Jane Austen. Wonderful.
5,Great!,"I, too, was lucky enough to meet the author and view his work before it was published. This book is a modern ""Giving Tree,"" with outstanding illustrations and a delightful story. This talented young author/illustrator will surely develop a faithful following of children and adults alike. Five stars!"
5,The first book was sooo great,The first book was so wonderful that I laughed probably for most of the chapters. The author captures the real teen spirit and makes the book understandable. She doesn't try to go above readers heads and make it so you can't understand. I think Jessie is in a way like me and in a way like all teenagers. I wish there could be about a million more books like Sloppy firsts and Second Helpings because I would enjoy all of them.
4,Awesome teen book,"I thought that this book was great. At first when I was reading this book I thought that it was going to be about some nerdy high school girl. I kept reading it and it was great.This desbribed her high school rebellion period perfectly. Along with the way that it desbribed her first experiences and emotions were perfectly in tuned with any young person. I didn't read the first one, but I still understood it well. The characters in it were great and all went together well. Megan McCafferty is a great writer."
4,"Yes, thank you","'Second Helpings' lived up to the reputation set by 'Sloppy Firsts'. This book is hilarious and insightful.I once again found myself captivated by Jessica's self-discoveries. Each character in this story is well developed and the interactions are highly realistic. I also like the journal-esque format and found this to be a quick and very fun read.I would suggest reading 'Sloppy Firsts' before this book, though it is not necessary. They are both amazing novels, for men and women.I highly recommend this book and 'Sloppy Firsts'. Be on the lookout for 'Charmed Thirds' due out April '06."
5,Me. Yes. Me,"This book is totally awesome. I'm 18 years old and I loved this book. After reading the first book: Sloppy Seconds- I had to get my hands on this one- and I enjoyed it even more!! Jessica's life is the complete same as a regular teenager- heartbreak, sex, friends, family, death, birth. And I really enjoyed her sarcastic thoughts- they weren't annoying at all. I was literally laughing out loud. I cannot wait until the third book. Anyone who has an interest in this book, definately take the chance and read it. I wasn't able to put these 2 books down."
3,"A good, if not comprehensive, look at Sheridans later career","This book is an examination of General Sheridan's post-Civil War activities in the West. Far from being a biography of Sheridan, however, this book examines the issues relevant in the various capacities in which Sheridan served, and looks at the way they were handled, both by Sheridan and his subordinates. This work is far from being a comprehensive look at Sheridan's post-war career, and in fact covers only the most important topics (the most prevalent being the Indian Wars), but it nevertheless serves its purpose. By itself, this cannot be considered a definitive work, but as part of a study, either of Sheridan or of the frontier army, this book is definitely worthy of consideration."
4,carhart work shorts are tough,"I've been buying carhart work wear for years,the pants, coats, and the shorts are quality products that don't give up with a few washings and lots of abuse!"
1,wrong size sent twice,"I ordered a size 34x32. I received 32x34. So, I returned them and a week later received replacements... size 32x34. After 2 weeks of waiting for pants and not getting anything I could use, I returned the WRONG size for a refund. Too much frustration... I will just find a local store where I can go in and get the right size."
3,A little short on the inseam,"These shorts are nice and heavy duty feeling,only problem is they have a shorter inseam than I like. Im 6'2"" and these shorts end just before my knees. I will see how well they hold up since I am pretty tough on my work wear. aside from them having an 8 1/2"" inseam I like them so far."
4,Good shorts,"Comfortable, well made, fit well, true to size, particularly the large one I have.I would buy them again too."
2,Handle detached from mug after 2 1/2 years,"I loved this cup, used it at work for over two years. I always washed it by hand. Its never been in a dishwasher. Yesterday, as I was cleaning it, the handle broke away from the body! From the picture, and from use, you would have thought it was welded, but it was either glued, or welded poorly.I will try to get replacement under warranty. If not, I would not buy it again."
4,Definitely worth it (for me),"Sure, it's $25 (at the time of this review) and of course that made me hesitant at first. Realistically, however, for my purposes it really wasn't that bad. I needed a slightly more professional mug for coffee / tea / etc at work and this was perfect for my needs. It's the right size, quality, and style... and it matches the Nissan thermos I also picked up on amazon.Don't get me wrong, I don't think I'd invest in a whole kitchen's worth of these mugs, but for what I need and the amount of use I get from it, the price isn't a worry. As an added plus, it was eligible for the 4-for-3 promotion."
3,Par for the course Dremel attachement,"Makes reasonably quick work of trimming a door edge that rubs, but doing a neat job takes some practice. Heavy touch up sanding will be required.This Dremel attachment is like every other Dremel attachment I have been suckered into buying, it is clearly designed by bean counters. It works just good enough that I would feel bad about throwing it out. For $20, it is a nice tool to have, but I would gladly pay more for one that had a better guide and did a neater job.A couple specific gripes:1. The 1/64th depth isn't off by a bit, it is off by a factor of 4. It planes nearly a 1/16th off per pass. I'm still trying to figure out how they came up with the 1/64th number.2. The guide is useless, it is up to the user to attempt to keep the tool flat on the surface. This takes some practice and will result in some gouges and uneven planed surfaces that need to be smoothed off with sanding."
4,Worked great,"I planed two doors with this and it worked great. I had a hard time getting it to lay exactly flat and I didn't expect that to be an issue at all. Might come better with practice, but seems like it could have had an adjustable lip on the other side or something.Looks like quality work, and glad it included the bit for the dremel. Love it so far."
5,Timex kids watch,"This is the second Timex Kids watch I have bought.It is excellent value for money.The great thing about it is that it is water resistant (although the strap is fabric).My kids love the night glow illumination of the watch face too.The strap is adjustable - so it will fit any sized wrist.The only down side is the plastic watch screen/face - being plastic, it scratches easily - but for the price - you can't expect sapphire crystal!"
4,So far I love it,"This is a Christmas gift for my 21/2 year old so we haven't really used it yet but its very cute and looks well made. I didn't realize by the description but the little lizards actually move, which I think my son will find pretty cool. He's pretty advanced for his age and has been showing a big interest in clocks and asking us what time it is, so I think this will be a great tool in teaching him. Plus I think he will feel like such a big kid with his own watch : ) Hopefully this watch lasts us until he grows out of it. We will see."
5,Fun and tough,A very fun way to help your child learn to tell time. Also withstands the abuse kids dish out. The design is also very cute - I love the little lizards on the second hands! The elastic band makes it easy for a kid to put on.
2,Too many ideas left unthought,"Molly Brown: Unraveling the Myth by Iverson attempts to combat the myths that have lived on about ""Molly Brown."" While Iverson has done extensive research on the topic of this woman, the book as a whole does not give an understanding of the woman. Her thesises, such as Margaret fighting the stereotype against western women, are left unargued. As a whole the book is poorly written and compiled. There are a few glimpses of hope while reading a facts are intertwined along with the rambling manner of the book."
1,The Kids Aren't Alright,"Allow me to dust off an old cliche and say, Now That's What I Call Crap!This music (if you could call it that) is on its way out. I don't know what's on the horizon. Hopefully it'll pull music out of the funk it's currently in. Maybe it'll just get worse (if that's even possible...). Either way, ignore this album and series, and check out GOOD music. Classic rock. Punk. (REAL punk, i.e. Ramones, Sex Pistols, Clash, NOT Blink 182 and Simple Plan!) Metal. Hardcore. Alternative. Even some funk and 1980's hip-hop. Many classics are passing you by, kiddies! And you're ignoring them for... ho boy... KAYNE WEST???Let's just clear this up right now: emo sucks, rap since 1992 sucks, country sucks, pop sucks, R&B; sucks. There. I said it. Now take it home and run with it."
3,we need another British Invasion,"This one isn't thaaaat bad. I think the NOW people are being too kind to Keith Urban but as usual there's more rap and R&B than anything. That's why we need someone to put more pop on radio (not R&B, rap, hiphop, triphop or whatever). We need more dance, more Euro. Anyway, about this CD, I do like how the NOW compilers put current smashes and not-so hits on there (""O"" and ""Jessie's Girl""). I do think there could be better rockers than Chevelle they could have put on here. I had never heard of that John Legend song until I listened to this, and I must tell you it's very lifting and it helps me get over a girl :). If you have collected every NOW CD since day one like me, pick this up. If you like maybe 3-5 songs, still pick this up."
4,Not As Bad As People Say,"There is one classic song on here ( drop it like its hot) A couple of really good songs ( Obsession, O, Only U, Soldier Balla Baby) alot of ok songs (What u waiting 4, Vertigo, collide, I jus wanna live, rumors, ect.and some plain mediocre songsNow 19 should beShakira-La TorturaBEP-Dont Phunk(mess) with my heartDestinys Child-Cater 2 U or GirlJ.lo-Get right or Hold u downBaby Bash- Baby Im BackFrankie J- How to dealU2- sometimes u cant make it on ur ownGwen Steffani-Rich girl or Hollaback girl3 Doors Down- Let Me GoGood Charolette- WE BelieveLindsey LOhan-Speak or OverBack steet boys- IncompleteJohn Legend Ordinary PeopleKanye west- DiamondsThe Game- Dreams or Hate It Or Love ItLudacris Get Back, #1 spot, or Pimpin All OVer the worldBobby Valentino- Slow DownPussy Cat Dolls-Dont ChaAshanti- Dont Let ThemNelly- Na-Nana-Na"
3,Geordie DVD,"DVD arrived with the center storage core broken. I could hear something rattling inside the package (not a good sign)When I opened it, the DVD fell out. There was surface scratching, which didn't seem to bother the playing ofthe disk (a few hic-ups were noted) However the DVD cannot be stored in the case, as there is nothing toattach it to. (center broken off) Needed the DVD for Christmas, so didn't complain, till now."
3,CHROME????,"I'ii keep this short and sweet. ""Not even close"". This is a high gloss SILVER metallic paint. It's a good paint with excellent coverage and it looks great for the color that it is SILVER. I'll keep looking for a real chrome paint."
1,Don't waste your money,"I used this product on a number of ares where my cat urinated. The product does not work, and the urine odor is still there. It actually made the smell worse, and it got so bad that I have to rip the carpet out in my walk-in closet and replace it with tile. I have yet to find a product on the market to remove cat urine odor that actually works."
1,Does NOT work - avoid this product,"I have used several different products to deal with cat urine clean up and this is, by far, the worst. It contains alcohol which not only damages some furniture surfaces (namely wood floors), but also causes the product to evaporate more quickly thus making the effective time on the stained area shorter. It also causes a good deal of the odor to permeate the room as the alcohol evaporates into the air. I have had to use multiple treatments on certain surfaces and have still detected residual odor. This product is a waste of money."
5,"Essential Reading for Judges, Prosecutors, Police Officers","From The American Spectator, November-December 2002:This family favorite is essential reading for judges, prosecutors, and police officers who wonder what went wrong with our laws of search and seizure. In a frontal challenge to conventional history, my father shows that the two major cases establishing the exclusionary rule-Weeks (1914) and Mapp (1962)-were contrived test cases brought before the Supreme Court by dishonest means. Chief Justice Rehnquist once asked how it happened that modern Fourth Amendment law ""brought to bear in favor of accused murderers and armed robbers, a rule which had previously been largely an application to bootleggers and purveyors of stolen lottery tickets."" He will find the answer here."
4,reader from Oklahoma,A well written book. This book gives a fascinating look into various opinions of women from Arab countries. The beauty of the Islamic religion is explained as is the danger of religious fundamentalists (to women in particular). I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't know a lot about the Moslem world (and Islam). Price of Honor has given me a new appreciation of the Islamic religion and a better understanding of some of the political situations of Arab countries.
2,Disappointing,The book is outdated. The book inlcudes several stories of women in the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. The stories told seem to be stories of the most extreme cases of abuse and do not describe the lives of the average women in those regions. Several of the comments regaridng Islam made by the author and/or women in the book are incorrect.
4,A good overview of women's conditions in several countries,"The author, Jan Goodwin, has produced a facinating overview of the treatment of women in several nations. She has done her homework: most of the men and women she interviewed were verifiable sources, although a handful chose to remain anonymous. What bothered me though was her seeming acceptance of anti-semitic views on the part of some, especially in ""Muslim Missionaries, American Converts,"" and the chapter on Palestine. This is probably a misunderstanding on my part; I live by the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty.'La escritora, Jan Goodwin, logro producir un libro fascinante sobre el tratamiento de mujers en diferentes paises musulmanes. El libro esta lleno de entrevistas con mucha gente, la mayoria de que son mujeres. Ella visito a Saudi Arabia, a Egipto, a Paquistan, y otros paises, y me parece que conoce bien el topico."
3,The truth is out there.,"We have ushered in the 21st century, yet some of us continue to live in the tribal past. Female Infanticide, female circumcision, tribal branding all these continue to be the bane of womenfolk today.Please, women of the world, look around you and see for yourself what atrocities and crimes are being perpetrated in the name of protecting you. I ask you....does a woman really require a man's protection?Did not Hajar protect Ishmael from the desert sun when they were banished into the wild? Did her cries not bring forth the spring water.....? revered by all muslims...the spring of Zam Zam......So who really needs whom?I only hope that one day all of the world will be free and an egalitarian society.As for obtaining info from an embassy, I wish this person would try living in one of these countries, the truth will be revealed."
3,A beginners book with a few headaches,"Most of the cards in this book were very simple. A lot of these types of pop up patterns can be found on craft sites for free. The only really challenging pop ups are the TV and the dancing hula girl.The biggest complaint I had with this book is the measurements and paper sizes are in cm and A4's and A9's. A conversion chart would have been really helpful. My other bone to pick is the templates are all at a reduced size...which granted I can understand, but the sizes aren't standard, some templates need to be enlarged 135% some 120%...this makes it really difficult to scan and enlarge at home, you almost have to use a copy machine.If I had browsed through this book at a store I probably would have kept looking."
5,Chic...,"For years and years, I avoided this album like the plague. The main reason was the song Dance, Dance, Dance (Yowsah, ...oh, you know the rest). In 1977, when this album came out, they played that song to death on FM radio. So, I didn't buy it. Fast forward 30 years. I stumbled into ""Falling In Love With You"" on Youtube and was surprised to find it on this album - my loss. I bought it and have enjoyed it ever since! Let's be frank, this album was a fore-taste of things to come! Get a copy and remind yourself of times past, when you were younger, freer and could party all night long!I rate ""Chic"" by Chic: 5 stars (yes, I'm biased - but so what?)"
5,Steal of a Deal,"Being a Chaplin fan, I own all of his movies except the Keystone days. I purchased this because the now defunct First National Collection is 9 (used) to 30 times more expensive than this collection, and doesn't include ""A Dog's Life"". I figured at worst, I would get a copy of ""A Dog's Life"" out of the deal. Other than the 2 discs being mismarked (switched) for content, I found absolutely nothing wrong with this collection as far as watchability due to the film speed, mentioned in other reviews. These films are all in fantastic condition and hilarious. I would recommend this product without hesitation."
5,Son in law loves this goal,My 24 yo son in law was thrilled with this goal. Now in his culd-de-sac he's the king pin.It takes a lot of sand to fill this puppy up too!Water will only freeze and crack it in the winter.
3,GREAT BOOK!,This is a really good book. i love the way Katherine descibes the way some of the characters act. I have to say i like Zoey the best because she's a hopeless romantic that isn't seen very much in books for teenagers. if you haven't read this book alread i advise you do.
1,"Would you like milk and sugar, Madge? Cookies?","If I want to hear women talk for an hour and half, I'll arrange a coffee klatch. It might be slightly more expensive, but it sure as hell will be a lot more entertaining."
2,Good graphics but mediocre game,Only one game time - shoot any ball you want!No 8-ball or 9-ball etc. game
5,Worth it's weight in gold!,"I purchased this book out of desperation for such research in Cairo Egypt - at the time I had no idea it was so rare and valuable. I was aware, though, of the value of its information!There are a lot of more up-to-date books available and I'm sure that you would be wise to read them for their more timely advice and information. Still, this is the sort of book that doles out a lot of useful information without getting so tongue-tied in all the variants and precautions that one can sit back, relax, read, and learn without having to scratch oneself bald!Of course, it would be unwise to spend some 300 dollars for such a text just for relaxation - this book is a collector's item and should be considered as such unless you are as lucky as we at LJ's Breaking Free$ - Bill Anderson (LJ)."
5,Gingrich the Historian Alters History,"Because of my interest in the American Civil War, it was recommended that I read Never Call Retreat. I was not told that this was a sequel to a prior book, and very quickly I encountered historical errors, which initially made no sense. It became clear that Gingrich was rewriting history as it might have been based on his thorough knowledge as a historian. His portrayel of Lincoln, describing the President's political as well as military difficulties from the state rooms of the White House, brought home to the reader the perilous predicament of the military location of the District of Columbia. After George Custer falls during this war and not at Little Big Horn, I was led to ponder whether or not he was going to have Robert E. Lee triumphantly march into Washington DC and claim the city for the Confederacy!You cannot put it down until the end. A great book."
1,Avoid this company (Bargaincell)!,"Bought a cell phone battery that, of course, died one week past their return/refund deadline. Refused to refund or replace even though the product is CLEARLY defective. This company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again. Consider yourself warned."
3,Not a Prestige Award Winner,"Several people slammed this movie hard. It's not Oscar material and wasn't meant to be.Remember the time period. In order to show some skin or penetration, it had to be an ""Educational"" film. They tried to make it more fun than a dental visit while still trying to titillate. Too much of that will make the sensors scream ""NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!"" So you had to do some cheese, some education & as much sex as you could get away with.They didn't go through all 26 letters. They hit the highlights, & gave us the best looking, free-loving people of their time they could convince to do it. Take it for what it is, lightly veiled porn when that was all they could do."
5,FASCINATING LOOK INTO THE STATE OF OUR WORLD,This was a very disturbing but fascinating and meaningful book. We only have to look at what is going on in the world around us to see that Mr. Romano's theories ring true.
1,Good concept. Poor design.,"This is a replacement. My old one worked great, but a part broke and I was forced to buy a whole new replacement. No parts are avalable. Replacement broke second time of use."
1,BUY A REAL SAW,"THIS THING COULD BE FOUND IN A CRACKERJACK BOX. UNLESS YOU ARE CUTTING BALSA WOOD, BUY A REAL JIG SAW"
3,"Don't Tell My Wife, I'm Hanging A Bat House",Seems like a nice house. Hope it works. We have way too many mosquitoes and insects in our backyard. A few hungry bats should do the trick...and no they rarely get rabies.
1,poor,"Must be a very old story, very poorly written. List interest very quickly. Seriously, you want my review, but then tell me how long it had to be?"
5,Great for all the kids,"My daughter loves to play with the sweet streets. They are great little homes and work well with a growing girl she has been playing with them for a few years now, she even plays with her twin brothers. Because there are moms and dads also brothers and sisters and dogs.. The kids love it... GREAT and priced right.."
1,i never received this product,i am really upset that this record never came. i waited over a month for nothing. thanks alot. for nothing
3,A Bit Boring,"This album has merit, but I can't push aside the feeling that this album sounds more like an exercise in making blunted, layered music than an inpired effort.Whereas MHTRTC was focused and cohesive, this album just meanders. Whereas the songs on MTHRTC were clearly a product of careful crafting and actual songwriting, the songs on this album seem as if they were created using a simple four-chord loop, twisted and stretched so as to retain the listener's interest for the requisite few minutes song length. They just glide by without offering anything but the now-familiar affected synth washes, slow-down beats and the sprinking of the ""nature documentary"" melody to make sure its recognized as a BoC song.Don't get me wrong - it isn't bad or anything, its just something that anyone well-versed with synthesizers could crank out if they liked. Dayvan Cowboy sounds as if it was written to be the backing track for a future Volkswagen Commercial."
3,"Greasy, greasy greasy.","I don't like this on my face. I'm sure it works well on other areas, and ""oh god"" if you get it in your eyes, but don't buy this if you want a sunblock for your face unless you want to feel like you've rubbed a mcdonalds hamburger all over you."
4,Good for body,"I agree with other users that this is not a good sunscreen for your face. It is somewhat suffocating. However, it applies well to arms, legs, neck, etc. It is easy to rub in and appears to work well. I would recommend this to folks who are looking for sunscreens with a good EWG rating."
3,OK,A required book for a seminary class. I remember it having some good points but also remember it being pretty slow in parts.
4,One time use,"For the price, these fishnets were great. I used them with my Halloween costume and I think for the $5 I spent on them, they worked real well. If you're looking for fishnets that will last a while, look elsewhere. As far as sizing, I'm 5'4 and on Halloween I weighed 144lb."
2,Not quite what I expected,"I should have taken a clue from the price, but these fishnets were not quite what I expected. The threads were too thick and not at all attractive on my legs."
1,"Just the facts, mam!","Stoppard's brief mention of surrogate motherhood looks like it was gleamed from tabloid tv shows and news clips. The negative portrayal goes so far as to conclude (erroneously) that one way surrogates may become pregnant is by having sex with the biological fathers! Readers who want accurate, helpful information about surrogacy or other alternative reproductive options won't want to waste their money on this book."
3,"Good general information, great picutres","I purchased this book before my husband and I began trying to conceive. There is a lot of great information about conception and fertility/infertility, although it would be nice if the author would include a section on the Fertilty Awareness Method and how it can be used to understand your individual cycle and identify any possible fertility problems. The photographs are wonderful, and the general information for each of the trimesters is great. I have found that now that I am pregnant I turn to more detailed books each night. This book describes each four weeks of development in only two pages, most of which have pictures. As a result, the information tends to be a little general. This would be a good gift for a first-time expecting mom, and I found it very informative as my first book on pregnancy and childbirth, but I wouldn't depend on it as your only resource if you like to be well informed about all of the details."
5,"Conception, Pregnancy & Birth by Miriam Stoppard","This is by far the best conception/pregnancy/birth book that I have read. I bought the book while trying to conceive my first child - followed the advice - and got pregnant EASILY! Now I'm pregnant again - with the help of this book.During my first pregnancy I read a dozen different books, but this time around this is the only one I will be refering to. It has excellent pictures and does a great job describing the different stages of pregnancy.I highly recommend this book!"
5,The Victim Keeps You Guessing & Ends With the Best Credits Ever,"OK I must review The Victim. I must admit I wasn't instantly hooked in the first 15 minutes. Once everything started to unwrap it was one of his best. I loved the Directing in a sense that it was authentic and real. As were all the performances. I must say too, my favorite ending credits ever. I also loved credits that showed all the cast with names but to do that with the crew-pure genius! Shows totally appreciation for this great crew as does the excellent behind the scenes bonus feature. If this is any indication what we have in store from Blanc Biehn Productions then I say Bring it On Jennifer Blanc-biehn and Michael Biehn! A match made in film heaven."
3,Too many cds for 30 songs,The three CDs could have been contained in only two or even only one considering that there are only 30 songs. It is very inconvenient to keep changing the CD after only 10 songs. The manufacturer could have saved costs by eliminating the excess CDs.
5,My kind of music,Listening to this music makes me happy! Only downside is that you must change CDs relatively often. Song selection is great!
2,Horrible horrible sound,"I had the DVD versions of all of these movies and ""upgraded"" to the Blu Ray versions and I have to say that I am shocked by the audio in this package. The levels are so high that even at low volumes the audio clips out.So much for the next generation in home entertainment..."
3,Good for the Paintings,"I'm not a fan of the instruction format the publisher decided upon for this book. Complete paintings are shown with a detailed description by the author of what she painted how, why and where. It's an approach that reminds me of written instructions for finding a road as opposed to drawing a map. I happen to be more of a fan of the step-by-step painting in progress form of instruction. If you don't like step-by-step or don't mind all-in-one-shot instructions next to the complete painting then this book will probably rank higher. Having said that - the instructions the author provides are detailed and solid.The paintings are in a very loose manner so don't expect highly detailed, color saturated paintings. Subjects range from landscapes (the most common) to florals to country cottages in meadows."
1,Easily Pleased?,"If you are very easily pleased, then you will be pleased with this self-published booklet."
1,NO INFORMATION!!!!,Why would anyone ever buy these or other movies when there is NO INFORMATION about what you're buying. It's absurd. It's insane! How can anyone rate something with no specifics?????Is this a fault of Amazon or the producters? - don't know. It's just ashame some of this will never be bought because no one bothered to provide even the slightest snippet of INFORMATION.
3,Average,"Otaru is injured while searching for his Marionettes. He wakes up in the hospital and finds Cherry & Lime. They have no idea who he is though. Otaru still fights to protect them and regain their memories. Bloodberry has gotten in with a bad crowd though. She lucks out when the circus comes to town. Some old friends help her out of a bind.I'm liking the story in season 2 pretty well. There isn't as much action as in season 1. I'm very disappointed with the production quality. The character animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are really bad though. This series was made in 1998 I believe. If you compare it to other stuff in that time; like X, Tenchi Universe, or Outlaw Star, this animation looks like horse crap. It's especially disappointing since the OVA looked so much better than season 2. I suggest renting or watching this online before buying."
4,Smells Fresh,This product makes your clothes smell and feel so fresh and clean. I love the smell of Vanilla and Lavender. Mix a little fabric softener with the liquid detergent and whyloa. You have freshness.
3,"Great smell, doesn't seem to last very long.","I bought a case, i am a bit crazy like that... But the smell doesn't seem to last very long after washing/drying. And I am using the matching dryer sheets.If you have an HE machine like mine, this will not do the job for scent, and you might as well go buy something cheaper."
3,Pay for what you get,This works fine but stretched out after about six months of occasional use (about 3 swims per month). It is a little short like some reviewers said and I have a small women's head. I had a TYR one previously and it lasted for years before it finally was too stretched out. I love these Lycra caps though in general because there is no hair pulling and they are easy to get on. I don't care if my hair gets wet. I went with this one because it was cheapest but will not buy again.
4,Affordable and Reliable,"I've had problems with regular latex swim caps ripping due to my nails in the past so I was in desperate need of something more fabric rather than plastic/rubber based. This Lycra Bathing Cap fit the bill. As many other reviewers mentioned, it will not keep your hair dry because it's made out of the same fabric as most bathing suits, but it does keep hair out of your face while swimming and stays in place for laps upon laps around the pool, all without tight squeezing feeling on your head that latex caps usually offer and without the line on your forehead afterwards.For the affordable price, I would definitely recommend this product."
5,Excellent self study tool!,"This is a great book to jump-start your EP education. Nice photos, it is easy to read and it should be purchased by all new EP Lab staff members. At TCA Institute, we recomended this book to all the ""Fundamentals of EP Course"" attendees. Maha Rinaudo, Ph.D."
4,Solid Rock History,"You really can't appreciate American Rock of the late '60's without acknowledging the important role of this band. From southeast Oklahoma, they stood little chance of mainstream acceptance, but one catchy tune - ""Western Union"" briefly filled the top Billboard spot. This collection underscores how much more potential was there. I knew, even played (with my own ""garage band"") a lot of these tunes when they were current, and it is an exciting piece of history. I am pleased to be able to hear them again now!"
5,Love Jimmy Neutron!!!,"I hated when this show was cancelled. I absolutely loved Jimmy Neutron! I love that I found it on dvd, so that I can watch him whenever I want. Love to laugh and this show will do it."
4,Good Buy,"Good, clean fun ... enjoyable for kids of all ages! The product was received in excellent condition and played without difficulty. I would recommend this set to others."
3,"pretty to look at pretty to listen to, but...","...I was not completely convinced this was a worth-it way to spend a $100. I gave one as a gift a while back and when I needed to buy a kettle, I bought this one for me.The first time I used it, the black part (the whistle) melted off. I was so disappointed. As it began to heat, there was a real pretty 2-part harmony that was started, but as I poured the water out, the whistle broke off. It looked as if the part of the plastic that met the metal part, melted.I gave it 3 stars because: 1. It IS a very fancy, pretty kettle. 2. The whistle makes a great sound. 3. Amazon service was great when I needed to return the first one."
4,Good product,"Wax off does a good job of removing wax, but leaves your hands feeling really greasy. It's hard to just rinse the Wax Off off your hands with just water. It requires some abrasive soap, but it gets the wax off so I guess that's what counts!"
2,My Review,I found this product to be slightly bland. I would have preferred it to have more spices & taste.
3,okay as a base,It was way too bland for our taste. It needed a whole lot of doctoring with cream and extra sherry.
2,It's here.,"Although this book is historically correct, I found it to be bombastic to the point of ad nauseam. No one should have to have a dictionary nearby to get through a book. Other than that, it backs what the Seventh Day Adventists have been predicting for over one hundred fifty years. Good stuff.[...]I'm just sayin'!"
1,Trash,"The third time the ball was thrown and hit the ground, it formed a bulge and lost all air. It was inflated below specs. You win some...you loose some. Wouldn't bother to waste my money again."
1,"outdated DW book, academic",I have read Ralph Kimball's Tool Kit as well as Nicholas Galemmo's Mastering Data Warehouse Design books recently - both are excellent for techno-functional professionals. This book reminds me of a textbook they made you read to have an overview of EDP about 30 years ago...
4,The High and the Mighty,"Well done for a movie of that time, the early 1950s'. Couldn't go wrong with the casting. Definitely a pre-cursor to Airport (1970) and its' ilk. Also the final scenes give a sense of nostalgia to SF Bay Area residents living here, then, when SFO was still known as Mills Field."
5,The High and Mighty,This is an excellent work that enables the viewer to get a better understanding of John Wayne's acting capabilities. When are the merchants of greed going to release it? Hopefully we are not waiting until his name is only related to the westerns?
3,Sterling & Trevor didn't deserve their nominations....,"Claire Trevor and Jan Sterling were nominated for best supporting actress Academy Awards for this picture in '54 and lost to Eva Marie Saint of ""On the Waterfront."" After seeing the film after its long habitation, Trevor and Sterling weren't really deserving of their nominations. Their roles do define supporting but there is nothing standing-out in their performances. Of course, Trevor hams it up in her good ol' dame role she played so well, but this year, the Oscars were on the money by giving it to Saint for ""Waterfront."" The other 2 nominees for supporting actress 1954 were Nina Foch for ""Executive Suite"" and Katy Jurado for ""Broken Lance."" Jurado certainly didn't deserve her nomination either - nothing memorable, Foch was o.k."
2,A Highly Overrated Disappointment,"I'd heard about this ""great movie"" for years, ever since I was a kid in the '60s, so I'd been looking forward to seeing it ever since I heard it was coming out on DVD. What a disappointment! Everything in this film is a predictable cliche. The characterizations are lame, the acting is grade B, and the Duke (whom I love) has very little to do. There is absolutely no action -- it's a bunch of people sitting on an airplane reflecting on their lives punctuated with some pathetic flashbacks. It's interminably long, too. The only thing interesting about it was getting a glimpse of what air travel was like in 1954. If you have to see it anyway, save your money and rent it -- there's no way you're ever going to want to see this turkey more than once."
1,Kindle product,I thought I was purchasing the movie here to be sent to me. I did not realize I had purchased a product for Kindle which I do not have. I know it is my fault I did not read enought evidentally but I am disappointed.
3,Classic.,I think maybe this was the first commercial air disaster movie. It is dated but a nice retro trip into the way flying used to be beofre the TSA and 911. I grew up in the era when commercial flying was a pleasue and the airlines actually appreciated their customers.
3,Author Information Highway,"This book expanded my knowledge of authors who write to kids. It helped me learn more about Edward Eager for a school project. Although the info was fascanting, it did not provide all the info that was needed to help me with my school project. The book will help tell kids about the authors behind the stories they read everyday and for that reason, you should read it."
1,shippers should check the package before sending,"i ordered this item for a gift. it arrived in time, but the plastic surrounding the item was all cracked up, there were no batteries. the ad says batteries were included. we were unable to use the gift when opened because there were no batteries in the package. I would have purchased batteries before hand if i would have known you were going to forget to send the ones i paid for. i had to use my gas and Chrismas day to find a store open that carried those size batteries. shame on the shipper that sent a broken up item, with batteries missing."
1,the pragmatics of space,"I received this catalog from architect Terry Brown, a participant in this traveling exhibition, and found it to be a beautifully bound and extremely well presented publication, covering a number of master designers. Spectacularly photographed and arranged, this is a reprersentation that any artist, architect or novice lover of the organic realm of architecture would be proud to own in their collection. Full of history and insight, I have seen few collected so well. Edward A. Schatz- architectural archivist."
1,What the...?,"I will refrain from going down the list of songs on this heap. They are all bad. What makes them bad is really sad too...some of the vocal performances are outstanding, but all of the intrumental parts are just badly produced, sounding incredibly thin, having been performed by studio artists. I own every Maiden album and every Maiden ""tribute"" album and this is by far the worst. Do not let some of the big names on vocals rope you into buying this one. I really want to know how they feel about this- did they hear the background band at all- I would venture to guess not. To compare, listen to Di'Anno's other versions of Wrathchild since his exile from Maiden- even the his live version on ""The Beast...Live"" is better!"
5,5 stars for the towel; 2 stars for the color,"The towel is great, however, the color ""crystal green"" that I ordered looks nothing in person like it does in the picture. In person it is more of a lime green. I'm glad I ordered the washcloth first before ordering several sets because I would have really been disappointed. The towel is great, just keep in mind that if you are ordering the crystal green that it is more like lime green and not the soft green it is on Amazon."
3,"Good basket for the price, needs some work","This basket is a good price, but you will need to add additional chains so the disks don't just 'fly through'. However, this is easily doable if you are just a little bit handy so for the price and with minimal work, it's a good deal."
4,Good product,"Now for die-hard disc golfers you might want to spend an extra $150 bucks or so to get a high-quality goal, but this works fine.The one thing I would recommend is adding more chains to the goal. But you could use bungee cords or something else for that.It's easy to assemble, I've only had it for a week, so far no rust on chains but I am expecting it to happen in the future.If you're on a budget, or are just a casual player, I would highly recommend it.The other downer is that shipping is $19.99. However it arrived two days early just in time for my brother's birthday."
1,very cute but they broke quickly!,"After just a few wears, the star fell off of the stud. I guess that's why they were only five bucks!"
4,praising integrative leadership,Integrative leadership richly illustrates the principles of coompassion and wisdom that serves as a beacon for others bringing positive productive change to any workplace.
4,life changing,This book has opened my mind to a new way of thinking. This book has gave me both the courage and desire to become a better person. I recamend this book to all those who seek happiness in their life.
3,APA MLA Pocket manual,"its a guide, item as described, helped me with some classes so it served its purpose. ! ! ! !"
5,Great condition,"This item was in a great condition. It is a very helpful tool for english language writing skills. It contains valuable informmation on how to properly use commas, quotations, citations, colon, semi-colons etc."
3,School Literature,"Since this is a purchase for school use I have rated it neutral. The manual was delivered on time, properly boxed and the price is appropriate for what it was, a soft cover English reference manual."
3,A Pocket style manual,"good for an old edition, but it would sure be helpful to know that there is a newer edition"
2,You can't judge a book by its cover,"The book opens with a chapter that seems very much like the many dissertation or thesis proposals I read during my academic career. Thick with jargon and esoteric language. The final chapter is unusual--it seems the author wishes to use radio talk show hosts to demonstrate that women ask more appropriate questions about automobiles than do arrogant men. Men,due to their gender (according to the author), that must demonstrate expertise where they have none. The rest of the book reads more like a political treatise than history. The bottom line; however, is that as an auto museum docent and lecturer I did not find this a useful or readable book. I would not recommend the book to my classes nor to our patrons. Finally, the author presents a consistent conceptual or ideological point of view throughout the book; thus, I suppose if you are like-minded the book might be of interest."
1,What the hell is this?,"I bought this cd when it came out hoping it would be as good as the old ones. But I have tried to like it, forcing myself to listen to the songs, but they are cheesy, the only one that is ok is ""Aun no me toca"". La Flaca, was their best album ever, I guess they set the bar too high with La Flaca and now they can't do anything as good. Depende was ok but after that I don't know whats wrong with this group. I still listen to La Flaca even though I've been listening to it since it came out all the time, thats how good it is."
3,Great for little magicians,My 8-year-old received this for Christmas and has been working on new tricks every chance he's had since then.
5,Perfect for my needs,"I run a business in California and was given this product from a friend who had used it and had good things to say about it. I found it very easy to use (i'm not the techiest of people), and the data was very accurate. I did a search for dealers in the state of California and was quite impressed with the results. We also used their custom data service to buy additional leads, and found them to be of top quality at the most reasonable price we could find.I'd recommend."
3,VGA Wall Connector,"This device works and provides the connectors needed to remote the wiring of a computer display, that's about all the good that I can say. The unit fits loosely in the face plate and you have to be sure to purchase the extra deep wall box to allow for the connector depth. The fixture is not as sturdy as I'd like but I guess it will hold up to the constant reconnecting of a classroom. Before I purchase this again I'd do a little more searching for another supplier."
4,M505X Seventh Month Update,"I previously reviewed the M505X in January 2004 when I initially purchased it, comparing it to the Toshiba M35-S359, and giving it 5 stars.Since then, I have had a few issues. The most annoying problem has been the resolution when attached to a projector. Neither I nor Gateway support was able to find a setting that allows the screen to be viewed properly, and I've tried a few different projectors. The image is always to big for the viewing area. This is important to me since I make presentations frequently and bought the laptop for this purpose.Also, the subwoofer developed a sound problem, and wasn't as clear and vivid as when new. Gateway promply sent a new one however, and it seems to be working better.I still feel that the M505x has the best screen (except for Sony's xbrite), the best keyboard, and the best sound compared to all the competitors. If it weren't for the projection problem it would be outstanding."
4,Ballplayer: Pelotero,Great documentary about the Baseball industry and the training these children received. It really captures the pressure this country is under to produce great players and the importance of Baseball for many of these families.
4,Excellent but lacks in-depth analysis of professionalism.,I found it an excellent book but it really lacks specifically an in-depth analyses of the mercenary and professional aspect of Napoleon's Army.
2,Latin America?,"This is basically Mexico's answer (tv azteca) to Operacion Triunfo/American Idol etc. Seems like every latinamerican country has its own talent contest going on so the ""latin american"" reference in the description is extremely misleading. Unlike Spain's Operacion Triunfo with David Bisbal, no real crossover star has emerged from this show, although the winners tend to be quite succesful in their own country."
1,Took Forever!,"I ordered this item over a month ago .... I am still waiting for it!!! I know once I receive the product, we will love it, I have had them before, but I have never had anything take this long!!!"
3,"nice, but zipper sometimes opens",Nice mid-weight fleece. like that there is room for little feet to move. fits well around the neck. But a few times the zipper has come apart at the top when it is zipped up. I had the same issue with another Halo sleepsack. seems like a low quality zipper for a high priced item.
5,"Easy to use, keeps baby warm","We switched to these from the swaddleme blankets when our baby outgrew being swaddled. I like that they are so easy to use, like that the zipper goes top to bottom so its not poking baby's neck, and that it keeps him pretty warm."
5,Everyone should own one,My daughter hates things touching her feet. She kicks the blanket right off her but with this she has no choice. I can actually sleep knowing she is warm.
2,Could have done without the leaf it came with,"Let me start off by saying I love HALO sleep sacks have used them for a year now with my son. I have nothing against this actual product but more so with how it arrived.I find it difficult to believe that this product was new. The plastic wrapping was broken in places with tape keeping it closed. The sleep sack itself had a leaf, yes a leaf, on it within the packing. For the price of this item I expect that I am getting a brand new item not one that has already been opened. I don't feel the hassle of returning it and ordering another would really be worthwhile so I threw the item in the wash and will use it once it's dry.So in a nutshell, like the product wish I received one that hadn't previously been opened previously."
5,Halo Sleepsack,This product is great! My daughter is just over 2 years old and grew out of her medium Halo sleepsack - she is a little bit on the smaller side 34in & ~24lbs. I purchased the XL thinking that she would grow into it. It is large for her but she does not mind the extra room. The material is soft and warm enough though we live in Los Angeles so it has not been tested in a really cold climate. I would recommend this product to friends.
5,It works for us,"At 12 months old, my daughter is old enough for a blanket in her crib, but she rolls all over creation when she sleeps. There is no way a blanket would stay put long enough to do any good. We use the sleepsacks. Although she likes to crawl and stand (she's not yet walking), the sleepsack doesn't seem to get in her way. No issues with its bunching under her knees or feet and tripping her. The cotton sleepsack works well during spring and fall when the nights are cold but not freezing, but the fleece is perfect for the winter. She doesn't seem bothered that her arms are uncovered."
5,Successful purchase from Amazon,The new parents that I sent this to were very glad to get it. The mother had never seen SleepSacks. I like this baby sleepsack idea. I was pleased to have received this package from Amazon in a few short days.
4,Trouble...but good,"When I bought ""Trouble"" because of the single ""Somebody"" but when I heard the album I fell asleep cos I thought it was boring... but then a few weeks later I gave it a listen and I liked it. The stand-out song is ""Somebody"" as well as ""Open Your Eyes"", ""Honey"", ""January"", and ""Confessions Of A Teenage Girl."" I think this girl has lots of potential vocally and lyrically she can write like no one else I know but this cd is probably too comercializes cos they tried to hard to make it sound different than what is out there and that comes off sorta not very good on this cd but I like it and I hope her second is better."
3,wordy,"she has a great voice, and the songwriting is pretty good. She's a little wordy for me. her voice sounds a lot like Jewel, but more country. I think future cd's from her will be better. She's very young and should grow into a fine artist."
4,Nice Easter Music!,"The Easter songs are just right for kids. Easter songs make Easter so much more fun. These songs are fun to listen to! Along with this album, I would recommend 'Easter Songs to Christmas Melodies' by 'Nooshi the Balloon Dude' and 'A Very Veggie Easter' by 'Veggietales, also available for download on Amazon. Kids will be hoppin to these Easter songs."
1,Not to be trusted for 2002 and later,Haynes clearly did not update this manual for the 2002 and 2003 model changes. A good example: Power Steering Pump replacement. The pump location is wrong. The torque specs are wrong. The belt tensioner location is wrong. The belt routing is wrong. And on and on.Most damning is that the manual states regular power steering fluid is specified for the vehicle. Wrong again: Ford specs are for Mercon.I've been a big fan of Haynes Repair Manuals over 30 years. It's a big disappointment to see this level of greed--they just took the 95-01 book and slapped a new cover on it. Don't reward them for this.
1,Now I've heard it ALL,Ummm.... yeah....I've been a Maiden fan for over 2 decades but this is simply an abomination. Some things just don't sound good together. Steve Harris is a great songwriter. And pianist on this album is obviously talented. But two good ingredients don't necessarily equal a good product.What's next? John Tesh playing Slayer?
5,allows me to play the game,My husband has had unsuccessful knee surgery and his doc said his softball days are over. His physical therapist recommended this tape which provides support for the kneecap and he also uses it for his hamstring. This allows him to continue to play on his senior softball league!
2,More like a diaper than bathing suit,"Quality appears good but the fit is terrible for the ""slim"" body-type. As shown in the picture, the front is baggy. They LOOK and FEEL like you are wearing a diaper. Beware, the elastic around the leg is extremely snug relative to other square-style trunks. A fan of the Speedo brand (briefs and trunks), I didn't like the fit of these particular trunks at all."
3,Dissapointing..,"As someone who loves political and thought provoking hip hop I picked up this CD as soon as I saw the title, without knowing most of the artists. Unfortunately the title and imagery on the CD case are misleading, and this CD comes across as barely socially conscious. This is essentially an average underground album-average MCs, below average beats, and slightly less ignorant than mainstream rap. If you're already into these MCs then pick it up, but if you're looking for something that is actually revolutionary/political/thought provoking, skip this."
4,PUMP IT!,"Whew, I was at my cousins house and she was really into this new arcade hit called Pump It Up. I'm a HUGE dance game fan, I do alot of DDR and Pump was new to me. WOW! What a challenge is this compared to DDR. This game is not all steps and hope, you have to lear rythms, practice your songs and improve. This is a great game to a true arcade dancer, or just a DDR fan that needs some thrill to their routine"
5,Can't help it - love this movie,Not for your children because of language and sexual situations. It is a clash of life style and life culture done with full humor.
2,Smells Bad,I guess it works but it smells so bad I sent it back after it was on for 2-hours. Maybe if it was in the garage it would be OK.
5,One of Life's Little Pleasures,Now this is living. Take a hot soak with this stuff and everything will look (and smell) better. One of the Burt's Bees cornerstones.
3,Too much money for not much product...,There isn't a lot of product for the price you have to pay. I am not sure I would buy again just for this.
3,"Both relaxing and powerful, but somewhat uneven.","A few of the tracks on this CD are quite good. The last one espicially has some wonderful guitar and sax work. Over all an excellent CD although a few of the slower songs have a ""elevator music"" quality to them..."
2,A disappointment,"This was my first Julia London and I had high expectations- the excerpt suggested unbelievable angst as a man kills his best friend in an inexplicable duel. But the book never measured up - the characters didn't make sense. The supposedly smart and unconventional heroine behaves very immaturely. The supposedly smart and dangerous gentleman, can makes lots of money, but can't solve the mystery of his own birth. The characters simply were not consistent and therefore not very engaging. I kept reading because I curious about the mysteries Ms. London was at such great pains to suggest. About half way through, my interest picked up when I thought I saw that a supposedly minor character was the major villian, only to be disappointed with the ending."
3,WHO'S HIDING?,"I'm all for the fantastical in children's stories and I'm s big a skeptic about Darwinism as anybody, but a story where the owl hides from the rabbit and the mouse just seems to underestimate the common sense of even the littlest kids.The rhymes work well enough and the artwork is terrific, but credulity gets pretty severely strained."
2,Disappointing follow up book,"We LOVED Bear Snores On. This book was a disappointment. A few pages were cute, but most of the rhymes felt forced and the thematic verse (like ""but the bear snores on"" but in this case was ""Bear says, Who?"") was terrible. It had no cadence and felt choppy and too short. I'm reluctant to buy the other Bear books."
4,My 5 year old son loves this series of books,"We have the other books written by Karma Wilson, but this one wasn't as good as her others. It still had the beautiful and fun illustrations, but the story wasn't as captivating. It's still a good book, but I recommend her other ""Bear"" books. My son memorized them due to the great sing song words she used to describe all the details!"
4,Bear is back,"Fans of the winter tale,Bear Snores On, will like this summer time story about finding friendship. While this installment in the Bear stories doesn't quite have the rhythm of the original tale, it is still very sweet and dreamy. Board book format allows even the youngest readers to enjoy the story."
1,I was swindled,This item is not as the picture in amazon.com I received an item that not was ordered. Is Diferent. Amazon did not replace the product. he is not responsible.
5,My Boys Were Cheering For More!,"When roudy, squirmy boys beg for more, you know you have a hit in your hands! Not only did the story carry them - and me - along, the lessons taught can carry them through life! In a very natural fashion, Hutchens introduces themes such as the joy of hard work, manners, cleanliness, the foolishness of drunkenness, caring for others, Bible reading and prayer.This book could be used as a Sunday School class discussion - a week per chapter. Its strength is that though filled with nuggests of sound Christian wisdom and advice, it is not preachy or devoid of story line. We enjoyed this breif tome so much, we are looking forward to starting another Sugar Creek Gang book tomorrow. This fun read is worth the time and generated some healthy discussion. It is definitely boy friendly! (Note: I caught my 11 year old daugther listening in as well.)"
3,Not Quite As Good,"This book is exhaustively researched, but lacks the style and emotional impact of Weir's earlier works. Perhaps this is due to the dearth of reliable information on Eleanor of Aquitaine. Certainly, she was no less interesting than Elizabeth I!"
4,Very Readable Biography,"This is an excellent biography of Eleanor of Aquitaine. All the others that I have tried to read are bogged down in footnotes and geneologies, but Ms. Weir turns her into a person, something more biographers should try for. I would recommend this book to anyone."
4,"Run on, run on, run on, Aqutaine.","A truly facinating account of the family, politics and times of Eleanor of Aquitaine. There seems to be a great shortage of information about Eleanor herself and most of the time I forgot it was a book about her until she is mentioned again. I do not believe this is the fault of the writer as I believe there is precious little information available on her.My only real complaint is the overwhelming ubiquitousness of run-on sentences. The sheer volume of them should have been an embarassment to the author.All in all a very good book although the title mislead me to believe it would be a book about Eleanor. It is an excellent look at the times she lived in and the family that surrounded her.If you are not interested in the time period then this book will be a disappointment. If you are, then you will enjoy this book as much as I did. It was entertaining and fascinating."
3,Passable.......,"I guess it inescapable that a biography contain the contemporary attitudes of its' author. Be that as it may, once Alison Weir gets done foisting her modern day convictions on a 900 year old woman this book becomes merely readable. Eleanor gets lost, however, through much of the book as it concentrates more on her second husband, Henry II. One longs for the supplement to Kathryn Hepburn's enticing portrayal of Eleanor in Lion in Winter, but comes away with mere glimpses. Perhaps, enough material hasn't survived the ages to round out a book on this 12th century queen or, perhaps, she is overshadowed in her time by one of the most intriguing kings to ever rule England, Henry Plantagenet. Either way, Eleanor of Aquitane: A Life, is short on information, short on spark, and becomes but an average read."
2,"Read for fun, but look elsewhere for facts","Although Ms. Weir does a marvelous job of asking provoking questions and painting a vivid version of the medieval world, her editor should do a better job checking her facts. Her conclusions about the number of images of Eleanor that exist are incorrect, and overall she relies on archeology and art history to prove her case - without actually bothering to check on the facts that these two important disciplines can provide. Although charming as a story, Ms. Weir's work is lax by scholarly standards, and should be carefully considered as such. A marvelous writer, but perhaps a less than thorough researcher, Ms. Weir is great fun - but I would quibble greatly with anyone who would responsibly try to use her work as a factual guide or textbook to the time and persons presented."
5,Eleanor of Aquitaine,"This is an excellent portrait of a famed woman. Alison Weir is a talanted writer, who, not only mixes fact and proves and disproves myths about Eleanor, paints a picture of life for everyone in that time. She doesn't just tell people what Eleanor did, she shows people by explaining the past and personality of almost everyone Eleanor encounters. This was the first book I've bought by Alison Weir, and I'm now sure that I will have to buy her other books. The writing was excellent and highly developed. I was never bored. Even my mom, who has no interest in history whatsoever, read this book and thoroughly enjoyed it. We both learned a lot we never knew."
2,Eleanor of Aquitaine,"Unfortunately not the book I was expecting, in fact it had more to do with Henry II, and was extremely factual, if that is what you are looking for. Having read Elizabeth I I was disappointed it wasn't more like that"
2,Eleanor: A Life,"Allison Weir is usually a terrific writer but I am having a problem getting through this book. Her book about Lady Jane Grey, ""Innocent Traitor"" was wonderful. This book, ""Eleanor of Aquitaine: A Life"" is very dry & hard to get going. I am only on page 121 & started reading it over a week ago. I usually read 2/3 books a week but I'm not giving up! I will persevere & finish it because Allison Weir is such a knowledgeable researcher & deserves my determination. It is picking up a little since she is now married to Henry so we can only hope for the best. Will still read her in the future."
2,Too long,"This was a very interesting bit of history but it is wrtten like a textbook. And, the last third of the book was poorly written. Editing seemed to be forgotten. It was just a bit wordy and too long."
4,Awesome,"Great album that continues in the grungy postpunk vein of ""DDD,"" though it's not quite as consistent as that masterpiece. Poster Children are in a class by themselves. Buy this and turn it up really loud."
4,"Great product, minor flaws","The items are a great size for small hands, and I think they are a good variety. However, the paint on some items is coming off and staining the other items in the box."
3,Paint is peeling,"We bought this for our son when he was 16 months old and he loves playing with them. However, now that he is 2, I've notice the pain is peeling off around the edges. I buy a lot of Melissa and Doug toys and usually satisfied. This is a disappointment."
3,not as much fun as other Melissa & Doug products,This doesn't compare to the birthday cake or pizza for fun. For fruit & vegs play food I would suggest the velcro cutting food instead. Way more interesting.
3,nicely made but can be dangerous,"My son sometimes throws things and these wooden items have made quite a few marks and scratches on our furniture and wood floors, also can be pretty dangerous if thrown at people! I like the felt pretend food better- soft and harmless :)"
3,ok,Arrived with some of the paint transferred between food. Not as great as I expect from Melissa and Doug. My 2 yo enjoys it.
2,Paint Comes Off Easily,"I bought this food set thinking the wooden version would be more durable, safer, etc... than the plastic food. However, the paint chips off in large pieces every time it is dropped. I don't feel that it is safe because my son gets paint chips on his hands, could eat them, and is tempted to peel off more paint from the toys as they chip. They look great initially, but I would not recommend them."
3,"Good, but for one detail...","My son has a great deal of fun playing with this food with his play kitchen, the one problem is this... the food is not washable. One piece of the set got dropped into some real spagetti and when I washed it off, the paint/coating started peeling off, so I just had to throw it away."
3,A little on the small side,"This christmas Santa brought my 19 month old twins several of the Melissa & Doug Food Products. While it is the same above par quality as all the other products we received from M&D, everything in this set is miniaturized. I do like the food groups and what each wooden crate contained however for me personally I would stick with getting the bigger individual sets."
3,Sturdy toy but a little too hard,"This toy is a great educational toy, but because it is made of wood it can be a danger to toddlers who are still into throwing things around and biting things. Some of the pieces could have been better made to look more like the object........the tomato, orange and egg for example just look like coloured shapes."
5,Mana rocks,Sword of Mana is going to be a hit for all ages. The incredible story and real time rpg battles will keep you hooked.
2,Not Final Fantasy Adventure,"Final Fantasy Adventure for the original game boy is one of the best games of all time. Sword of Mana took the original game boy game and sucked all the life out of it. What they got wrong: pacing, length, too much story, and unnecessary deviations from the original. The original had many connections to the Final Fantasy series. The original title for the game even called it a Final Fantasy game. It was as good as the best Final Fantasy games. This version would be a playable, slightly enjoyable waste of a few hours, but only if you've never played the original. For those who have played the original this game will just make you wish you were playing the original again. Bottom line: this is the saddest remake I've ever played in terms of its' destruction of the game its' based upon."
5,Remake of a classic,"Final Fantasy Adventure is the first action-rpg I ever played, and it was head and shoulders above most other Game Boy games when it was released. It had terrific action and an easy to follow, yet engaging plot. If you've never played a Squaresoft game on the Game Boy before, you're in for a pleasant surprise."
4,Follows successful formula of Mana series,"If you ever played mana series and loved it, this game will not disapoint you. And if you are new to the series, this is good way to start =) Not to mention, having a portable version is plus. Not as in depth as secret of mana, but still was very entertaining."
5,Jack Webb is an ICON,"What more can I say--He's the best.If it wasn't for him, there would be no cop movies right now. He started it all. Cops--Law & Order, CSI, NCIS-Third Watch etc. Thank You Jack Webb"
3,"""This is too weird!""","Well, this is another movie in the ""losers win"" genre of screenplays. Sometimes, these movies really are funny and nicely done (Nerds, In The Army Now, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and especially The Breakfast Club). Other times, they try to be successful by hitting you between the eyes with a two by four.My head hurts.""This is too weird!"" is what a teenager told me. I agree. This was my view, entirely. Weird Science had a weak, weak, plot. It seems as if the goal was to allow teenage boys the opportunity to consider... what? Fantasy? Pretty weak. Heroism? Pretty lame. How to get a date? Not on this planet. The race dichotomy is very troubling.Now this movie did have its funny segments. The exit comments of the bikers were pretty funny. I just expected more, a LOT more. Like Encino Man, Weird Science will not go done as a comedy classic."
2,I wish I could love this like others do...,"Weird Science has a funny high-concept premise and an endearing cast, but even when I was a teen and the movie was brand new, I thought the humor was messy and heavy-handed. I never understood how so many of my contemporaries consider this a ""classic"", especially when stacked up against Revenge of the Nerds, Real Genius, Better Off Dead, or even Hughes' masterful 16 Candles or Ferris Bueller. Still, the movie is not without a certain odd charm and there are some great moments (mainly involving Bill Paxton); I find myself wishing Amazon would let me give it an extra half star!"
1,Universal is ........... you - again!,"Bad news for John Hughes fans, those waiting for feature-laden new special editions of his holy trinity - Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club and Weird Science - will undoubtedly be disappointed by the upcoming reissues. Although all feature newly remastered 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen transfers and Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 surround tracks, there are no extras included at all aside from trailers, and Sixteen Candles doesn't even get that. While retail is a low $$$$$$ apiece, after all the wait and endless postponements, such bare-bones reissues are just another thumb-in-the-eye to the consumer. There are different versions of both films from TV and video, there have to be deleted scenes and outtakes, not to mention the fact that commentary from Hughes, or any of the films stars should be easy to get. This is the cd scam all over again - don't wait for a third, or fourth version of the films to come out - make them do it right the first time!!!"
5,Zoo Series Tiger River,"I use to have this album but i lost it..i am trying to find it again, i recommend people to listen to it it relaxes you with the touching light nature sounds and it even keeps you calm so you can get a nice night sleep..well that is all i have to say right now but if anyone likes tigers this is the album for you. :)"
2,An innovative album...but that's about it,"I'm not about to complain about all the hype this album seems to be getting. It's by no means short of creativity and the sound is crisp, but nothing else seems to stick. This band's work has been mentioned alongside the works of Spiritualized and My Bloody Valentine, which seems a bit blasphemous. Sure, Manitoba do use their influences to decent effect, but by no means even come close to those two bands. However, I'm not giving up on them...I think they could take electronica to vistas beyond our imaginations."
3,great book for NBA junkies,"the book is a (more or less)short history of the NBA from it's beginnings up until 1970. it is a great book for people who really want to know everything about the NBA (this is a part of that knowledge) but too much information for somebody who just wants to peek in. unfortunately there isn't a lot of information about the economical side of the NBA, which is what I was actually looking for (a book I can advise herefor is ""America's Obsession, Sports and society since 1945"").all in all a good book with a lot of facts and numbers (with an extra statistic part included at the end of the book)"
3,Secret History of the IRA,"This is a fair and informative book on The Troubles. I've read many (Holland, Coogan, Bell, etc) and thought this one was the best until I read ""Secret History of the IRA"" by Ed Moloney. In terms of depth of insight and analysis, especially as it relates to Gerry Adams and the Peace Process, Behind the Mask pales."
2,"Too noisy, no auto setting",I do not recommend this model. It is too noisy and does not have any automatic setting. Buy a different heater.
5,Power packed little heater,I have been enduring the ups and downs of my office temperature for over 4 years now. Previously my company chose not to allow us to have heaters. But due to the inconsistency in the heating/cooling system they have allowed us to have heaters now. I was in search for a compact cost effective product. I went to several local stores but was not able to locate one due to them being out of season. Amazon.com had many selections and I read some of the reviews for the products and ended up choosing this little beauty. I even have coworkers borrowing it from time to time. They are also looking into obtaining the same one. I am very pleased with my decision.
1,seems designed to fail prematurely,"Since the space for air flow between the metal fins is so fine, this heater becomes completely clogged with dust in two seasons (two winters) of use and effectively becomes useless. Were it designed with cleaning/servicing in mind, this wouldn't be a problem, as all fan-forced heaters become clogged with dust eventually, but this one is RIVETED shut, the rivets being placed down deep holes, making them inaccessible. Reaching the internal works for cleaning without sawing open the unit is impossible. How cynical or incompetent could someone be to design a unit which will so rapidly become unserviceable? Don't waste your money on this model -- choose a heater designed with accessible internal works."
1,ON OFF ON OFF ON OFF,This heater worked fine for the first week or so then it began to turn on then off then on then off. I expected it to turn off when the temprature was met but not every 1-2 seconds. I would not buy this heater again even if it were only 10 cents.
1,Bad From the Start,"I purchased this product shortly after buying a home with a non-working furnace. I also purchased 2 space heaters from another vendor. The other vendors products have worked as expected (thank god), but the Honeywell space heater was defective from the first. I probably should have dealt with it sooner, but with painting, plumbing, and refinishing floors and all of the chaos that comes with a fixer upper I let it go.It runs well for about 3-5 minutes and then shuts off. I susppect a defective heat turn-off. I called the service number on the bottom of the unit and was told to mail the unit for a replacement. The cost of shipping was to be paid by me. Since this was a cheap unit, and they were going to replace it with another cheap, possibly defective unit, I decided to save the shipping cost and just toss this thing in the trash."
1,Junk,"I only gave this one star because there was not an option for zero stars. This lasted 3 weeks until it broke. I bought it during the summer, getting ready for winter. By the time I opened the box, my Amazon 30day warranty expired and the manufacturer requires a fee to send it back to them. Long story short, I'd be out another $15 to get this piece of junk replaced. It's not worth more than five dollars new, seriously, it's a total piece of JUNK. I'm sticking to the oil-filled radiator heaters. DeLonghi is the BEST, I've had several of them, each lasts about 5+ years and you can get one for $50 on Amazon, with free shipping. And the oil-filled radiators are alot easier on the electric bill. Don't waste your time on this piece of junk forced-air Honeywell heater. If you decide to take a chance on buying it, be sure to open it Right Away, so that hopefully you'll be covered by your 30day Amazon warranty when it breaks."
2,Dissapointing... Worst is the noise,"The unit is disappointing in that it sells at approx. $30 and provides only one speed and a very unreliable (basically not functioning) thermostat. It also creates much more noise than other similar units I have seen. Over all I would recommend a different buy. It got two stars because like any other comparable heater, it heats a medium room quite fast."
5,Great Little Heater,"This Honeywell ceramic heater is by far the fastest heating ceramic I own. Heat output is very good and the fan is powerful enough to distribute the heat out into the room, unlike most ceramic heaters.The only negative is the fan is a little noisy.Great heater and highly recommended for heating bedrooms, bathrooms and other small rooms."
4,Good space heater,"The heater is quite good. My only complaint is that there is no real temperature control. It has an ON-OFF control. Whenever it is ON, it blasts the full heat. The ON period can be controlled (probably also the fan speed), nothing else. However, for its price, it is a good piece."
2,"Desktop, not floor heater!","Heater works fine, but the controls are on the lower edge of the front, making it difficult (hands and knees) to change temp. Also, no handle at all!!! is a very bad design flaw. How does one pick it up to make changes if getting on the floor is not in your preferred posture profiles. It could have been done easily, keeping the small format, with folding or recessed grip handles. Good if you want to put it on a shelf or desktop or never touch the controls."
2,Honeywell HZ-315 Heater,"1. The heaters have not on/off switch, just plug it in. Within one week, one of the two heaters do not work when it is plugged in. I guess at the cost, I got what I paid for, but it is poor quality workmanship."
5,The absolute best young adult book ever,"I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!! If I had to recommend one book for teenagers to read- and believe me, in the past ten or twelve years I've read just about anything of quality to pass through a bookstore- I'd pick this one. It's FANTASTIC!!!! I don't know what exactly makes it so great, but the stylistic devices used by Katherine Applegate, along with Nina's first-person accounts, make this my complete favorite young adult book of all time, if not my favorite book ever. I've read it at least ten times. So if I can read one book ten times, the least you can do is read it once."
5,Wow!,"Jesus, Nina sure wen't through alot! My blood ran cold when her uncle said they were going to adopt a child! Luckily, Nina spoke up. i would have been afraid to tell. Let's hope what Christopher was doing didn't mean any thing. Anyway, it was great!"
5,Better than the original?,I waited 3 months to review this replacement OEM battery. An earlier Panasonic battery I ordered did not last very long. I was going to give up on the phone. This newer replacement battery fits into place but looks like a new design. It holds a charge as long or longer than the original batteries. Now I don't have to get a new set of phones.
5,Very Good Telephone Rechargeable Battery,"These batteries are reliable, long lasting, and are the battery of choice for all of our cordless telephones. After buying just two, we ordered additional replacement batteries and will continue to use only the Panasonic batteries in the future."
1,Received used and/or opened battery packages,3 out of the 4 battery packages I received had been opened and taped back up. There is nothing in the description that says these are used/refurbished/returned batteries. I have no idea if they will work as well as batteries in unopened packages and will likely not know for a while if I decide to use them and not return them. I feel like I received defective goods. The seller should have disclosed this.
4,Excellent Schubert,"Mr. Brysson's review is spot-on. The main draw here is the Schubert sonata.I was disappointed with the sound quality in the concerto; as it is live, it's only a mono recording, while the rest of the disc is in crisp, cleanly mastered stereo. It's an okay, if not superlative reading.But the Schubert really is THAT good. Highly recommended."
2,It's not a real Poison,"I am a big fan of Poison. But after I watching this DVD, just feel very disappointment. Kotzen didn't show a good attitude in Posion, he totally can not play C.C.'s solo. In the other words, he didn't put any emotion and feeling in C.C.'s guitar playing part. Terrible feeling in every Poison's famous songs... And the guitar tone is not right, I can not hear the good feeling bright tone from Kotzen's guitars. He only play good in solo of his songs. So, Kotzen didn't melt into the band, still play his own things. And the sad thing is, Bret still needed to say again and again about ""big welcome to Kotzen, thanks Kotzen..."" Kotzen was the worst member in this DVD, and didn't worth any good word!If you want to see Bret and others, you can buy it. If you love C.C., don't buy it!"
1,"BAD, bad, DVD!","First, I just want to say that I haven't bought this DVD or saw it. I am a Poison fan though. I am a Poison fan with original members in it, which means not Richie. I do not own Native Tounge nor will I own this dvd. Sorry! Any real Poison fan would do the same thing....I did give it a 1 star only because I couldn't get away with giving it no stars.PS Just to let you know...Poison didn't authorize this, the record company did. I also can't own something that didn't come from the band."
1,You get what you pay for.,"Save your money, I should have known better. I am a Clydesdale and laced this rim up for my fixed gear commuter bike. I have broken spokes on every ride. I will be re-lacing the hub to a Sun CR-18 rim that should hold up far better!"
1,Don't Order From This Merchant,"Never received the order. Package tracking indicates USPS never received the package from the merchant, who also didn't respond to my inquiries. Now I get to jump through hoops with Amazon and Amex to get my money back. Save yourself the aggro."
5,My Favorite Gift,I received this CD for a gift a couple of years ago and I have never grown tired of it. I can listen to it over and over and it never fails to relax.
2,Not worth the money,The sterilizer is hard to use with Dr Brown bottles b/c of the height of the bottles. I have to do the bottles and nipples separately and it tends to leak a lot of water.
4,Satisfied with product,"Overall I am pleased with this product. Yes, there are a few small problems but like another reviewer wrote, they are very small concerns when considering how well this product works. It is easy to use and I don't think 8 minutes to sterilize is an inconvenience at all as oppose to the ""5 minute microwave Avent"". I also think it's hillarious that reviewers are complaining about using the 8 oz. Dr. Brown bottles in this sterilizer. I use Dr. Brown bottles and all you have to do is sterilize the bottles first, then do the load of the accesories...no big deal. I feel it gets the job done to my satisfaction and it is no hassle."
1,Don't buy this ever...,"Bought this at the birth of our baby Girl. Lasted exactly 2 days. Returned if for a new one, which again lasted 2 days.My simple piece of advise. Get something else.Gave it one star because there was nothing lower."
1,Just a Complete Waste,"I received my especially for baby steam sterilizer for my baby shower and was very excited that I would now have way to sterilize my baby's bottles and save time doing it. WRONG. With this sterilizer you have to sterilize the sterilizer before you can load the bottles in... so that's about 13 minutes, then you can put all the bottles and accessories in, then wait another 13 minutes, then you have to clean the sterilizer. It takes about half and hour to sterilize one load of bottles and accessories. If that's not bad enough mine broke after only 3 uses. Do not buy this sterilizer! It is a waste of your money and time... my friend has an Avent microwave sterilizer that she uses and I've used it, as well and have no problems... It sterilizes the way its supposed to and it does save you time."
3,Aarti Mohindru,This sterilizer is quite like an ordinary Dish washer. One has to wash the bottles to remove all traces of the formula before putting in for the sterilization process. But no doubt it saves us the hassle of boiling the bottles periodically. Its quite convinient and easy to use.I was not dissappointed after the purchase!
4,A Little Tight,"I had to sand down the plug with a foam nail file because it was too hard to remove. It only took five minutes, and it works fine."
4,No album art,One my of favorite movies. DVD came in good shape except didnt have any album art. I'm a huge fan of John Hughes so any movies of his is great!
2,"Good movie, bad quality DVD","Sure, the movie is a classic among the John Hughes teenie bopper movies. But this DVD leaves nothing more than a bad quality picture and no special features what-so-ever.Unless you HAVE to have the movie on DVD, stay clear of this one."
1,Not an acceptable PG movie!!,"Warning! If you are careful about selecting movies that are appropriately rated for your kids, don't buy this one! It carries a PG rating, but by today's standards, it should be R, based on language and nudity. We had to turn it off. If you think anything goes in today's world, then go ahead and buy. I have nothing else to say about this movie, because it was stopped after 15 minutes or so."
3,"If you are looking for a good film, look further.","I bought this movie because it was said to be in the same league as ""Breakfast Club"" and others. Oh boy what a disappointment. I have never seen it before, so I can't say if the soundtrack was stolen, but the humor of the story was quite often forced. Yes I had to laugh at times, but movies like ""Breakfast Club"" or even ""10 things I hate about you"" are by far better. Three stars because it was not completely thumbs down, but definitely nothing to write home about."
2,-,"I LOVE this movie. This movie couldn't have come out at a better time. I was right in the middle of my teen years and probably saw it everytime it ran on cable in the summer of 85. There were so many things I could relate to in this movie. I have to say however that I was VERY disappointed in the VHS release because most of the music had been changed. I understand it had to do with licensing and money but come on, the music is also what made this movie great. How do you go in and change a movie once the whole world has seen it? Its kind a rip off and makes you feel John Hughes didnt care much about preserving his movies original form and integrity. I think that was just wrong. I was really hoping the DVD version would have had all the original music now come to find it doesnt. I wont be buying this one. Why even bother to release it at all."
3,Love the movie but where is the original music?,"This is one of my favorite movies, but no one should pay [the high cost] new for this out of print movie. The music is not original to the movie because the studio lost the music rights. That's why it is out of print. So, my advice is this: wait till its comes out in its original form. And to those selling it for [the high cost], get a grip."
5,Great Movie well worth watching,We recieved this movie quickly and undamaged. My daugter 12yrs old just asked for it out of the blue and loved it.
4,Fun movie that reminds me of my own highschool days...,"Sixteen Candles is always fun to watch, just because it reminds me of so much of my own days as a student. The movies has its flaws, technically spoken, but it makes me laugh everytime I see it. John Cusack plays the dork, for a change. Some characters are a little too stereotyped, granted, but it's still a good laugh."
2,best left in the past,"I was disappointed when I received this dvd. It advertised as having the original soundtrack, but it does not. It's just not as good as I remember. Perhaps I have matured."
5,One of the 80's Best,"This is a very amusing movie and one of my favorites. The story focuses around Molly Ringwald on her 16th birthday. Her entire family seems to forget as they bustle around to prepare for her older sister's wedding. To add to things, her grandparents are staying at their house along with the very strange Chinese exchange student Long Duck Dong. Meanwhile, Sam (Molly Ringwald) is locked on her fantasy world revolving around the high school stud while trying to evoid the high school geek (Anthony Michael Hall.) A definite crowd-pleaser. The grandparents are a riot without even trying to be and Long Duck Dong is just...weird, but amusing. Molly Ringwald is terrific in her role. Highly recommended!"
2,Re-release Sixteen Candles,"John Hughes movies were a staple of the 80's. I believe that he deserves some respect. I rented Sixteen Candles a few years ago, and fell in love with it all over again. I had my chance to buy a copy of the DVD, but I passed on it, and its a mistake I have regretted ever since. Now if you want a copy of this classic teen angst film you have to pay an upwards of $50.00. I think this is ridiculous, and I told Universal this when I wrote requesting them to re-release this title again. However their answer was this ""We have no plans to release this title in the future"". Any of you out there that really want to see this title with a stereo soundtrack and extras (and believe me there are some) then write to Universal and complain please. This movie captures the teen years with such brilliant, unlike the teen movies of today, this movie has heart."
1,WHAT A DISGRACE! Who is the IDIOT that produced this?,"I cannot believe that some IDIOT produced this FLASHBACK editionand TOOK OUT THE ORIGINAL SONGS THAT WERE IN IT!!! What in the worldwere they thinking? They turned the greatest teen movie of all timeinto an embarrassment and disgraceful ""BOOTLEG"" COPY!ALMOST ALL THE SONGS ARE GONE FROM THE BACKGROUND MUSIC!!!Bowie's song is missing, Happy Birthday is missing, Strangersin the Night is missing, Love of the Common People is missing!I can go ON AND ON!!! This is an embarrassment to the public,an embarrassment to the production company ..and MOST OF ALLA OUTRIGHT DISGRACE AND INSULT TO JOHN HUGHES and his BELOVEDCAST AND EFFORT! This DVD needs to be RECALLED AND ALL MONEYGIVEN BACK! What a disgrace!"
4,"this is THE all-time greatest 80""s movie!!!!","Being a fan of 80""s movies , i must say this is one of my favorites!! Molly Ringwald is the 80""s teen queen, and the dvd is good, although i wish it had extra features on it such as trailers, interviews with cast,etc.Overall, it is a feel good movie!!!! go buy it ,you won""t regret it!!!!!"
5,great,"Perfect DVD, in the box as described. We have watched it a few times and it was a perfect gift for my 16 year old!"
4,What happened to the sound track,"This is one of the best 80's teen movies i can remember. Most of all i remember the sound track, which is out of print, the least i could have expected was to have it included. Kind of like a two for one @ an 80's flea market"
5,A very useful dictionary for ASL,This resource is excellent for use by someone who is learning deaf language and culture. I am very happy to see the dictionary listed among other Amazon books. All I can add is thank you Amazon.
4,girl rock and metal !!!,"I am a new fan and I think Crucify My Heart is an entertaining album. I quite like the ""pop"" songs better than the few ominous songs and I think the singer's youthful voice adds to that appeal. She just sounds like she is happy singing. That and the mix of very deep, heavy metal sounds is cool. ""Unchain"" is a great power ballad. ""This Time ""or is it ""Over Me"" sounds a bit pop-punk, and that is also very cool.I also think they are not at all similar to Lacuna Coil."
4,Adequate rock.,"Being a fan of woman fronted rock bands, I anxiously awaited the arrival of this CD. I had never heard of Lullacry before I saw this cd here, and took a chance. In some ways the gamble paid off, in others I found that this disk fell short. While Lullacry are surely talented musicians, and I do HATE to admit this, I think that bands like Evanescence (unjustly bashed) and the incomparable Lacuna Coil have jaded me to subpar musical stylings. While not as orchestral as Fallen nor as in-your-face raw as Comalies, Crucify My Heart is still a good album. While it falls closer to the pop side of rock, every song on CMH has some charm. Recommended."
5,Logitech Z2300 speakers,These speakers have great sound. Clear highs and very deep base (if so chosen). The midrange can sound a bit weak when playing some MP3 tracks. There is enough power for anyone but the speaker wires for the satellites are too short to reach the far sides of a room.I'd recommend these speakers to anyone looking for a 2.1 system.
4,powerful speakers,"I'm blown away with these speakers. This is a really powerful speaker system, especially for its purpose, ""computer speakers"". I'm afraid to even turn the thing up halfway, its that powerful. Only downside to me about this logitech speaker system is its midrange. Its got more distortion than the trebs or bass. But, for its price, it is a great quality system, especially if u like a lot of bass."
4,SUBWOOFER positioning tip!,"This is the best bang for your buck hands down, it easily outperforms more expensive Klipsch, Bose, Altec Lansing, and Creative 2.1 systems.My only gripe was an overly boomy subwoofer...however this was easily remedied by turning the subwoofer AWAY from my sitting position, towards the side wall. Its amazing power really outshines the competition, I never thought a one-driver satellite could perform so well."
1,Hardware quality utterly substandard,These sounded great until the left speaker stopped working within three months. Terrible workmanship. Hardware substandard. I never went beyond half the volume. Wonderful idea but poorly designed. I will stay away from Logitech products from now on.
3,Logitech Review,"Product is fine. But, I have an ""equivalent"" set of Klipsch speakers in another location & believe the sound of the Klipsch are better & more powerful."
4,Oustanding computer speakers,"This system is an excellent choice for a computer-based music system. It is not, however, flawless. Bass response is exceptional, but high frequencies are unimpressive, even using the iTunes equalizer."
4,Great sound and powerful system for your money,WE entertain in our kitchen/den and wanted a sound system for our Pandora internet radio that was enjoyable. I am very happy with the sound quality and strength that comes from the speakers and subwoofer. I had been streaming my music through my boston acoustics and it just couldn't play the music that powerfully. This system really kicks out the music and is wonderful for parties.One drawback is that the wires to the satellite speakers are fixed.
4,Very happy with this item.,Got this order from Amazon. Order came on time as promised.This speaker is very good. Never have problem so far.I wanted a PC speaker that does not take up some much space but yetstrong enough to deliver the sound I want.This speaker from Logitech satisfied my requirements.
4,a THX experience,"This is a great thumper(subwoofer) sound system. It made our floor shake.Watched Indy jones latest- THX sound. It was great, the whole family got into it. Great sound for such a small system. I got a great price on it too. 4 stars cuz it is a bit weak on the high range as others have mentioned Plug your mp3 into it for some great sounds too. I love the bass. It fit what we wanted it for great-sound for my wifes lcd TV with hdmi. The subwoofer was a bit large but what can I say the performance was worth having to rework the space in the dining/kitchen for it. I have a big screen with surround sound in the multi-purpose room. this system competes with it and it cost a lot more."
3,ok,it's not that bad. but there may be better items in the market than this so its good to look for other items before you buy this one. I like it but it wasn't that good of a deal for that much of a price.
4,Logitech Z-2300,"WOW The sub is mindblowingly deep! Love how it sounds. My only issue is there is no way (that I've found) how to tweak the treble in the desk speakers. There is some definite highs that I'd like to tone down, but otherwise SAWEET system!UPDATE: One week after getting and using the system, the Right RCA jack on the Sub stopped working. The desktop speakers were ok, it was just the jack that went bad. I called Logitech cust. service and they were very helpful in sending out a RMA# and paying for the shipping to send back to them."
5,"Excellent value, great sound","I don't write home about things very much. This product rates a good review because I was surprised by how well it works verses how much I paid. It also looks good and it's very easy to set up. Some people complain about it missing midrange. This is easily fixed using EQ settings. For me a little bump around 250 Hz does the trick. It delivers plenty of volume for an average living room. I especially like the small footprint of everything. Visually the setup is tidy and unobtrusive, but the audio really stands out. Shipping weight is appreciable so I can understand why it may not be free. I think it was still a good deal overall, and this cheapskate is hard to please. This product is a rare happy medium between the low and high ends of quality, where I didn't wind up wishing I had gone to one of the extremes instead."
5,LogitechZ-2300 Speaker Review,"The Speakers are EXCELLENT !The package came as promised and in excellent condition. I use the speakers at a cottage so they are only used very infrequently on weekends. However, they sound GREAT !!!I would highly reccomend to anyone !Best Regaqrds,Jerry"
3,decent,"these have plenty of power, but they are a bit muffled in the mid to high range. it makes watching movies and shows a bit annoying. i'd heavily suggestKlipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX Certified Computer Speaker System (Black)"
4,Pretty Damn Good,"people say this speaker system misses some frequency, yes it is weak in some part, but if you adjust your equalizer in your itunes, you will be fine. great speakers"
2,"Sub, amazing, satellite speakers, not so much.","the sub is insane, just wondering why logitech didn't put as much effort into the satellites.one of the satellites didn't even work when i got it.i'm sending it back and getting a new one, hopefully it'll be better on the next go round."
5,Simply awesome!,"After doing much research I decided to go with this system and I have not regretted my choice. In fact, I have been surprised at the clarity and bass of this system. Simple awesome, especially considering the price!"
4,"Good,but not great.","I received this product with high expectations.The sound that I heard from differant sources like my CD's and from my computer were(good to fair,not great).Too,much distortion for me(5-10%)The best thing about this unit is the sub woofer.You can feel the bass down to 50db.They say that the Z623 is a better unit.Don't believe it.Logitec has not got it right yet.As an audiophile for the last 20 Yrs...I'm certain that you'll ask me why I purchased it? I wanted to better the sound from my computer.Nothing fancy ,but at least good. I hate all table radios.Also hate distorted music.If you like clock radios,then this is for you."
5,Great Speaker System!,"I wanted a speaker system and researched various systems very thoroughly. I'm very happy with my decision to get this system. It is everything that I expected based on what I read. It's a great speaker system for the money. I consider it a good value. Just know that the subwoofer is very large. Although I had read this in the reviews, I was still surprised by the size when I received it."
4,This is as good as it gets!,"First, Let's make something clear - these are speakers for your PC! Second, the system sells for under $100.00 dollars! Finally, this system is an incredible bargain! Forget this audiophile horse manure - I want to just slap people in the head when they start trashing this system's sound.I listened to the Bose, Klipsch, Creative 2.1 systems and they all sounded good, but none of them outshined this system! I am NOT an audiosnob, but I do know what sounds good! Please tell me what more you expect for $100.00???This is, in my opinion, the bees knees in PC speaker offerings. You will not do better than right here. The Z-2300 is a tremendous bargain and sounds teriffic. I am very happy with this purchase. It simply does not get any better than this!"
5,The Best Computer Speaker I ever had!,"I used Altec Lansing 641 and some speaker systems before, but I don't like his huge body and too heavy subwoofer. The Logitech Z-2300 has a good balance between high-pitch and bass, and it also perform voice sound well! Moreover, Z-2300 has good deal and reasonable price!"
5,Great Set,"I bought these for my girlfriend. I currently have the Bose Companion 2. I have loved my Bose for a number of years, but do think that her logitech is a great set. Easily of equal sound quality, but capable of being much louder, and also much more capable in terms of bass and such."
5,Exceptional Value!!!,"I am an audiophile and have some idea what to listen for in speakers. These are not audiophile quality speakers, but for computer speakers they are amazingly transparent. They also have very detailed (not boomy) and extended low end. They also seem to be very well balanced across the entire listening spectrum. Tons of volume too with very little distortion. [...]"
4,pure and powerful,Really incredible sound and power for almost no money. really worth it.1 con..I would love to have a wireless remote
2,Good Bass and highs but nothing in between.,"These did not sound good. I know that other reviewers liked them which is why I purchased them, but these just would not do and I sent them back. I suppose maybe these would work for video games, but not listening to music or watching movies. There was good bass and highs above 3k, but there wasn't much in between. These sounded very tinny and cold.After sending these back, I spent twice the money and went with the Companion 3 system which sounds much, MUCH better!"
4,Logitech Z-2300 2.1 PC Speakers,"I bought these to connect to the 26"" Polaroid LCD in our bedroom to replace the Altec Lansing ACS33 2.1 unit that lacked punch.The results were not good, a buzz in the satellite speakers, a hum out of the subwoofer. Not what I'd expected.However, I hooked them up to my PC audio card and found that these were, in fact, very good speakers. So, I'll keep them for the PC!I think there was an impedence mismatch with the audio out and headphone output of the TV (the audio section in the TV is not very strong and is probably the root cause of the problem).If you want these for a PC, they're very good. I too found the midrange to be a bit lacking, but the overall sound is very rich."
5,AWESOME DEAL,"This product is really great, I recommend this to everyone. The sound quality is excellent. It is also THX Certified which makes it sound even better. The bass is ridiculous for an 8 inch sub. It shakes the whole house, well most of it. I love the little dial they give you to be able to control the bass and sound with ease. Instead of having to go through the computer to do it."
5,Epic Win!,"I was a little wary from the occasional reviews saying the quality was poor and that the sub woofer would blow out. Haven't had any problems whatsoever. They work perfectly, the way they were suppose to. Turned all the way up they still sound amazing, and the only thing I need to worry about it getting a noise ordance."
1,Terrible noise,"I was happy with this Logitech Z-2300 for six months. Now, I am upset and disapppointed. The left speaker is making static noise and it's very disturbing. Next time, I will buy a set of speakers that are not from Logitech. I don't recommend this one."
5,steal fo a deal,What a deal! I almost payed $250 for a set of Bose. These sound awesome! Be careful- They have a lot of Bass.
5,amazing,"Let me start off by saying I am very picky when it comes to speakers. I did me research and bought this pair without even hearing them yet and am I amazed. I will sit at my computer and listen to them and wonder how these speakers pump out such high quality sound. After I bought them I went to a few retail stores to test some of the ones I decided not to get and I am extremely happy with my decision. These speakers are the best of the best, I would recommend them to anyone."
5,Best Bang for the Buck I Found,"These speakers are absolutely amazing. They seem to be able to handle everything I throw at them without issue. As other have said, I did notice that some of my music was a bit distorted, but I've been able to mostly attribute this to the quality of the copy I have of the song and not the speaker's fault. Even with that, the good quality recordings I have sound amazing and even the poor ones I have sound decent and are certainly playable.However, this set is even better for gaming and movies. All explosions and gunfire in my games sound incredible and realistic. Combined with my X-Fi soundcard, these speakers are accurately able to reproduce sound based on distance (ie. your gun=VERY loud w/ a lot of bass, faraway shots are quieter and less bassy). It is the same case with movies and recorded TV shows.While I was wary of paying this much for speakers, I'm glad I did knowing I have something of this quality that will last me for many years to come."
4,Speakers,"For the size of the system, the sound is amazing!!! The speaker system looks clean and neat as well. The only problem is, one of the speakers has blown on me... even if not being played at full volume. It has happened to other users with the same set up. It's annoying to find this type of speaker system to fail after just a few weeks of general use."
3,OVERRATED,"hey yall, these are nice loud speakers. i am somewhat happy with them to keep them for now- i got htem used for a bit cheaper. i am dissapointed because the reviews were so great. the mid tone is somewhat missing. the bass is excessive. dialogue in movies is sometimes a bit hard to hear and muddied, so i fiddled around with it, but its just not how it should be.i used someones suggestion to turn the input all the way down and crank the logitech controls which does seem to give more clarity- mids and highs over bass. the bass is still very present turned all the way down. the volume is 7/8ths up (but with input volume at 1/8), and it is mild to listen to.listening to it now. i like it-but i can tell those of you with very discriminating tastes might want something else. i just don't know what to trust since this got great reveiws and bose gets poor reviews."
5,Best speakers for any price,"Amazing speakers at a cheap price. Sounds better than most home stereo systems. I am not a gamer, I listen to music and all music is balanced between the low bass midrange and crisp highs. Buy 2 and put one at every computer in the house!"
5,Great Book,"I myself and my son found this book very interesting and gave us a chance to sit, play and learn together. My son is attracted with this book, especially as all pictures are real pictures. I brought the book when he was 18 months he is 28 months now, he still spend hours with this book. I also bought with this My Big World Book and My Big Animal Book, but still this one more attractive with its variety and bright colors and lovely design."
5,Highly recommended for dry skin,"I have very dry skin, I've tried different kinds of moisturizer in the past and this is the only product that really works for me been using it for more than 1 yr now..Love it.."
1,Sci-fi...really?,"This book belongs in its own category- religious fantasy. While being touted as a sci-fi novel, this book is actually a weird view of Christianity involving aliens. It made no sense and I was confused from page 1. The character names were unrealistic. The entire vision of the novel seems distorted by a blind-eyed world view. I would not recommend this book to anyone who is serious about sci-fi. It cannot be compared to any futuristic novels in the sense of ""this could actually happen"". I was extremely disappointed.Whoever compared it to the great author Stephen King must be kidding!!"
3,The book its self is great.,"The book its self is great. This translation is lacking in many ways. I purchased this volume, put it down and ordered Maxiwell Staniforths translation and got a FAR better volume in translation as well as in quality of printing."
3,Prefer the Modern Library edition translated by Gregory Hays,"I found the texts of both to be fairly similar, but the design of the 2003 Modern Library edition in trade paperback size is easier on the eyes. Also, that book has a more academically-oriented introduction, which is helpful if that's what you prefer."
4,Less glorious than Sun Tzu's,"Less glorious than Sun Tzu's Art of War, but just as enlightening, the aphorism penned by Marcus Aurelius, the stoic second century emperor of Rome who died fighting German tribes in 180 (and the character played by Richard Harris in in the movie Gladiator), instruct us on ""the regimen of his personal life."" Useful for all who pursue timelessness and excellence, regardless of vocation, both imperial and managerial."""
3,the authors' names are indicative of the translation,"This translation is incredibly oversimplified just like the baby-food eating hill people or more accurately ""hick"" brothers who translated it, do yourself a favor and just get a harry potter book"
2,"big fan of eyewitness , not big fan of this!",this is NOT a good eyewitness video because ..............1.ONLY 1 SECOND OF DINOSAURS!2.TOO LONG!3.1 WORD...... BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!4.WASTE OF MONEY!!DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS YOU ARE A BIG FAN OF EYEWITNESS!
3,Alright,"ABK isnt a bad rapper, but this cd does not give his best. the songs are too short (some less than 3 minutes) and some tracks have too much of a rock vibe too them. But besides that, its a good cd and im sure any juggalo would like it. Ive listened to it a few times and its really grown one me. its a good cd."
2,Thick and shiny,"I decided to try Burt's Bees products. Some I like. Some I don't. This is one I would not buy again. It is really, really thick and leaves a greasy sheen on your face. The name ""Beeswax"" should have given me a clue. I prefer a thinner face cream."
5,wonderful book by a great writer,Gleick is both a knowlegable scientist and a masterly storyteller. This book is a classic about one of the most fascinating scientists ever. A must read for any aspiring scientist or anyone interested in science
4,"Fascinating life, very good biography","I had encountered Richard Feynman's name many times in popular science books covering quantam mechanics and particle physics. So I was intrigued when I saw his biography. If you're interested in the history of quantum mechanics, The Bomb, and the personalities driving modern physics from the 1930's through the 1960's, you will love this book. Gleick is a competent writer, but he gets a bit tedious when he strays from the primary subject of his book (Feynman) into self-indulgent philosophical detours like pondering society's definition of ""genius"". Also, if you are interested in quirky anectdotes about Feynman's life, you are better off buyingSurely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! (Adventures of a Curious Character)orDon't You Have Time to Think, on which Gleick seems to rely heavily."
2,Ho-hum...,"I read Genius for a college literature course. I thought the book was pretty boring. Some of the personal stories of Richard Feynman were interesting, but there were very few of them compaired to the remainder of the book. Other parts were intensely boring. Most of the book contained theories of physics. A pretty silly concept considering this is a biography!Overall I'd say this book was rather pointless. If you're a physicist or fan of physics (I prefer biology, myself) go ahead and read it. Otherwise, I would not recommend this book."
3,"Wonderfull scenarios, low driving realism","I bought this game because I loved Collin McRae Rally for PC. The scenarios are wonderfull, sometimes it seems like a movie, not CG. Unfortunatelly the driving miss realism. The car's damage simulation are fine but driving feels like the car is floating, it is very difficult to keep it on the road and light turns on the wheel makes the car slide like it was over ice. Compared to Forza Motorsport, Forza is much better in the driving simulation, even without a racing wheel controller you can feel more control over the car. I'd give it 10 for the graphics and car damage simulation but only 5 for the driving simulation."
3,I think it is fine and all but I think it`s mostly for teens and adults.,This game is probly not for kids from 4-10 years not that it has blood or anything but it`s just that it`s a bit confusing. I think it is mostly for teens and adults. Let me tell you some more things about this game. The graphics are good and the storyline...I don`t think it has any storyline. Also if your wondering what the rating is it`s rated E. Remember this game is mostly for teens and adults.
5,"Momma, don't let your babies grow up and become lawyers!","This was a riveting story - - read it! You will be uplifted most of the time, and outraged by the final conclusion. Many heros emerge in the telling of this heart-pounding story - - from Murdock the patient to the scientists working in the laboratory to the clinicians offering new hope to cancer victims. Two noteworthy anti-heroes also emerge, U. S. District Court Judge Roderick McKelvie and plaintiffs' attorney Donald R. Ware of Foley, Hoag & Eliot, Boston, MA, whose use of arcane points of law ensured cancer victims would be denied potential life saving technology. These two should enter into a suicide pact to honor the patients who died as a result of their efforts. Interestingly, Mr. Ware's firm represented big business in the book ""A Civil Action"", another legal saga in which cancer victims were denied."
2,Medicine for the Elite,"Although the ghost writer of this tale did yeoman's work, I was overwhelmed on every page by what was between the lines: Rick Murdock would have died from this disease had he not been a rich and powerful CEO of a company that specialized in this treatment area. The average person, that is to say all patients who do not fall into the top 10 percent of wage earners in this country, are subjected to health care that has become increasingly rationed. Mr. Murdock ought to thank his lucky stars and donate the proceeds from his (the ghost writer's) book to hospice."
4,good,"it was good.i got the book earlier than i expected.however, there were some marks for answeres.it was annoying.except that, i was satisfied."
1,Extremely Unimpressed,"I will start by saying what was good about this purchase. It arrived on time. Otherwise I was completely disappointed with the purchase. I had not expected such poor quality when I bought it. There were pen scribbles on the front cover, scribbles all throughout the book, worksheets still in the book from the previous owner, water stains on some of the pages, and a page that is missing its corner (from being ripped). I would not recommend using this buyer because of problems I felt with the honesty of them selling their products for their real condition."
2,Works but.......,"I should have figured this out before I bought this cable, but I don't like that I can't power/charge the unit while it's connected to this playing a movie. A fully charged battery will get through about a movie or two, but once the power gets low, the unit starts to freeze and has to be reset. Other than that, the cable works fine. No changes need to be made to display a picture. Once the cable is plugged into the Vision, it automatically switches to t/v out mode."
4,a very poor mix,"fantastic music, but why is so much of it coming from behind me? I hate to fall into the trap of reviewing the mix rather than the music, but i assume we all give this music 99 stars. I'm getting used to the mix, but I still wonder why Dickey, and Duane are playing from behind my couch, instead of to the left and right of my tv."
5,Fantastic,"This is definitely one of the band's finest recordings. I first got this on cassette when I was young but was too immature to appreciate most of the music. As the years passed I grew fonder and fonder and eventually got the CD after the cassette wore out.Greg is a great blues singer (a guy that ugly has gotta be), and Dickie and Duane play dueling Les Paul's on 23+ minute Whipping Post. T-Bone Walker's ""Stormy Monday"" has been recorded over and over again by almost every blues artist. However, this is without a doubt my favorite version of the song.It's been over 30 years. This is still one of the finest rock and blues live performances."
5,the one to have if you are shipwrecked on a desert island,"Can't really add much to the other reviews except that if you do not have this album, you do not have a record collection."
2,Disappointing,"This version of ""Live at Fillmore East"" is only selected tunes from the concert, comprising 1/2 of the music that was on the original LP. Be careful when buying, the full concert is only a couple of bucks more. Watch for the ""Extra Tracks Deluxe Edition"" which includes ""In memory of Elizabeth Reed"", ""You don't love me / Soul Serenade"", ""Whipping Post"" and ""Mountain Jam""At Fillmore East"
5,essential cd,"if you're building or adding to your cd collection, it's not complete until you have THIS album. Rolling Stone in 1973 rated this as one of the top 100 albums of all time. The were right! Beginning with the blues numbers and inserting 24 bars of jazz in Stormy Monday before defining ""southern Rock"" with the next two cuts, then ending with the finest jam ever recorded on ER and Whipping Post this music is absolutely timeless and is just as good today as it was in 1971. A Must Have for any CD collection."
3,Not colorful enough for a pre-schooler,"The ape that peeps out from behind the ""a"" is ant sized, features only the head, and is a dull grey in color. Similarly,very few of the, pop-ups, slides, or tabs reveal compelling colorful, well illustrated animals. I personally DID appreciate the black and white, uncluttered presentation of letters, but I DO feel that the peek out illustrations could have been improved upon. The ape, the bear etc, hiding behind the first two letters are badly drawn -- cartoonish is being too kind. Given my 13 mo old son's reaction to it, as opposed to his response to Chuck Murphy's amazing little pop-up books, I would say pass on it."
5,move over PD James!,"Mary Pilote's ""House of Bone"" is a well crafted mystery in the true British genre. With just the right characters to lead us in interesting (and devious) directions. The plot is finely woven and the characters are develoed well. A page turner that will leave you looking forward to Gemma Blake's next adventure."
2,Pretty Forgettable,"The songs on this CD are just not as captivating as on other releases such as Achtung Baby. The rhythms are fairly interesting, however the song structure relies on a simple chord structure. Therefore, no matter how creative The Edge may be, the songs just are not well developed. The title track, Wire, and Bad are probably the strongest tracks here and they are not overly fabulous. Promenade is a bit incomplete and Fourth Of July sounds like mere filler. The tone is a bit too angry for me over the course of the CD although others might not mind anger too much. For my money, I'll choose Achtung Baby."
4,Abit Dodgey,"Alot of hype surrounded '' The Unforgettable Fire '', after the commercial success of '' War''. U2 were tagged the next big thing and went onto prove that,but not with the c.d. Yes it was a good album, but I`m not sure it was a classic. Some nice songs here,but there were some duds too. Elvis Presley In America in my mind completely missed the mark, as did M.L.K. 4th July an unnecessary inclusion too,but there were some gems. The haunting title track was a pearler, as was Wire, Indian Summer Sky, and the gorgeous A Sort Of Homecoming, but that was about it. I did like Pride at the time, but it was overplayed in it`s day andbegan to grate. Bad went onto become a popular live song, however it never really grabbed me either. All in all it was a niceunoffensive record, but I think had they spent a little more time on it, and weeded out some of the fillers,it could have goneonto bigger and better things. Still a good record, and better than most around in it`s day."
1,Forgettable!,"""The Unforgettable Fire"" is a disappointing follow-up to their prior release, the sensational ""War."" There's not much on this album to recommend it as much of what's on here is bland and uninspiring, save ""Wire"" and the title track. A better alternative would be to get the video of this album as it shows what a creative force U2 was in the mid-1980's."
3,Wide Awake,"The first major step U2 took from fashionable cult status to superstardom, THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE seems, from the distance of more than 15 years, a muffled and mixed set of atmospheric Rock.Listening to this CD now it seems obvious that there's a little too much Brian Eno and a bit too litle U2 in the mix. The songwriting is all over the map, from solid rockers--""A Sort Of Homecoming,"" ""Pride,"" ""The Unforgettable Fire""--to extended riffs, like ""Wire,"" and lazy atmospherics like ""Promenade"" and ""4th Of July.""And there's ""Bad,"" a piece of brilliance.At the time it was released, it seemed THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE was a major leap forward and a pinnacle of U2's career. Looking back, it was only the first step, and not the height of their career."
1,??????What happened to linkin park?>?>??????,"Linkin Park could be an amzing band but sadly they became sellouts and oriented to the preps, posers, and even rappers! With each album they keep getting worse and changing.Hybrid theory- Amazing, original, and great talent.Reanimation- Remixes- horrible, very lazy and unoriginal.Meteora- Not bad. Better than reanimation but still did not live up to the first album.Collision Course- I lost all respect for them after this one. Now I hate rap (no offense) and i hate jay z. So this was the worst album yet and I beleive Linkin Park will become the next beastie boys(thats not a good thing)"
2,Better off downloading mp3's,"I have read other reviews and came to a decision that this cd is better off to be bootlegged. I saw the dvd version of the Jay-z and linkin Park collaberations and that was good but when I heard the tracks well I only liked these.1. Dirt off your shoulders/Lying from you. 4/52.Big Pimpin/Papercut 0/5""Sounds like your drunk and decided to make a remix for this one""3. Jigga what/Faint 3/5""I wonder what jay-z by jigga what?"" lol j/k4. Numb/Encore 4/5 "" This song received a lot of radio airplay because it's the most decent to put it on.5.Izzo/In The End 0/5 ""Best nu-metal song off the Hybrid Theory album ripped to put in with Izzo ""sucks""6. Points Of Authority/99 Problems/ One step closer. 4/5It's just new remixes I did a smart call by putting this music with reanimation album. You should too These bands will grow out of style and you won't be able to even sell the dvd on ebay. 6 songs and dvd not worth 16 bucks...rip off.."
5,My Favorite CD,"The reson I chose 5 stars is because i'm a huge Linkin Park fan and I love all their CD's but, when this came out I was like, ""What a joke"" then I saw the music video for Encore/Numb and then I loved it. I just had to get it and it's been my favorite CD since."
4,More songs!!!!!!!!!!!,"This CD is barely over 21mins, and only 6 songs. The DVD is a nice extra and makes the whole package worth the money. Personally I'd rather prefer another Reanimation CD for Meteora. The other thing I notice is that it seemed too rushed. Numb/Encore is probably the best track. They should've been as creative with the other songs. But hey I bought it, but I'm also a hardcore LP fan."
3,More songs would be good...,"First of all, I gotta give props to Mike for mixing these songs together smoothly. This proves that rock and rap music goes hand to hand. However, I found that just six tracks is not enough. Both Jigga and Linkin Park has lots of released materials. They could mix up way more songs than just six.They really should use new materials for rock/rap collaboration. It would be GREAT if Jay Z is splitting new rhymes while LP is playing a new beat.Overall, the CD is good for both rock and rap fans but it just not enough songs. Next time there's a rock/ rap mix lets hope its NEW materials."
1,Was Reanimation not a butchery enough?,"I'm with everyone who wonders what the hell happened to Linkin Park. Hybrid Theory was solid gold; Reanimation was anywhere from slight improvement (Crawling) to absolute butchery (In The End) of the same songs. Now LP has apparently decided that Reanimation wasn't enough of a mockery of their music, so they sent their songs to one of the most awful rappers in the world to be crapped all over and mutilated even more. WHY?!? WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO DESERVE THIS?!?"
1,HOW COULD THEY DO SUCH A THING?!,"I was a Linkin Park fan for a while, but then got into heavier stuff like: SYSTEM OF A DOWN, KORN, and DISTURBED. I WAS, key word...WAS, a Linkin Park fan until now! This is the worst thing that could ever happen!! Linkin Park was good...Aligning themselves with ""Jaze"" is an act of treason! This is the worst ""music"" anyone could hear...They took GREAT songs and made them into monstroseties! It is just downright WRONG to hear Numb all MESSED UP and LAODED with profanity! That was a prestine and happy song....Now it is tainted with EVIL!! No one get this lest you acquire a curse!! These are surley dark days...Linkin Park has betrayed me and all its fans! It doesn't even deserve this 1 star I am forced to give it!!"
1,should i get this more or less than 1 star?,first off Jay-Z and LP sucks. hip-hop and rock mix together sucks. i cant believe i listin to to cd. (when i was a big fan of LP & Jay-Z) but now hip-hop sucks. LP is not even metal. what you need to listen is to the following.1. Lamb Of God2. Slipknot3. 3 Inches Of Blood4. Arch Enemy5. Fear Factory6. Trivium7. Cardle Of Filth8. Himsa9. Devildriver10. Korn11. Killswitch Engage12. Mudvayne13. Static-X14. System Of A Down15. Soulfly16. Soilwork17. Unearth18. AC/DC19. Metalica20. Any metal artist you can think of.and another suggestion dont get any hip-hop crap you call music.metal is the real music expect for LPi'm not under 13 i'm 15
4,Best Idea Ever,"Wow. Big applauds to Jigga HOVA and Linkin Park for taking 2 genres I love and mashing them into music that can capture both audiences. I doubt anyone will be able to mix rap and rock like this ever again. It's the perfect goodbye for who I believe to be one of the greatest rappers of all time. And Linkin Park, one of the best Modern Rock bands there are, helps give it a...genius(doesn't make much sense but I felt I had to say it. By far the best song on the CD has to be ""Numb/Encore"", it just moves you into a state of say balance. If I haven't convinced you to buy this by now then you probably aren't going to."
3,it only blocks the f word,"Really man, I thought this was EDITED! Only the F word is blocked. Anyway... this album is alright... it seems (to me) that whenever jay-z starts rapping, the songs gets bad! Here is an example of how they dont block the words. they go ""If your having girl problems, I feel bad for you son, I got 99 problems and a bitch aint one!"" Yeah, I'm picky with words, but hey, I'm only 12! I think Linkin Park was the only the only good part of the album... :/"
2,Not really my thing,"I heard some (most) of the material on this CD, and i'm afraid it left me cold. a lot of it sounded like poorly mixed fan work. The concept itself didn't entirely appeal to me, either. The LP disc ""Reanimation"" had much the same effect on me, so if one enjoyed that, they will likely appreciate this work, as well.A lot of the music was Jay-Z rapping over LP's tracks, not really my scene altogether. But, again, others may enjoy this more. I personally would opt for ""Meteora"" or ""Hybrid Theory"" over this particular one.I think the thing that irritated me most was that when mixing the songs, there was little connection between the LP lyrics, and the Jay-Z lyrics. Connecting any work written by the former with the song ""Big Pimpin'"" seems extremely out there on a thematic level.I did like the ""99 problems/One step closer"" connection, however. That is why i have given this album 2 out of 5. I'm sure it is well worth the purchase for others, however, it is not my thing."
2,Ugh waste of money,Linkin Park is an awesome band but this album is a lot heavier on the rap side rather than rock. Here's how I rate their songs:1. Dirt Off Your Shoulder/Lying From You-4/5 I like the heavy guitar songs in this song more than the rapping.2. Big Pimpin'/Papercut-1/5 Geez this is the worst and most annoying song I ever heard3. Jigga What/Faint-2/5 Decent. Gets good once the faint music kicks in.4. Numb/Encore-4/5 This song is actually pretty good. Nice music.5. Izzo/In The End-1/5 The reanimation version of In the end wasn't good and this mash up isn't any better6. Points Of Authority/99 Problems/One Step Closer-5/5 Best song even though it contains an excessive amount of cussing.
3,coulda used a little more,"I love Jay-Z and I love Linkin Park, but it just sounds like any ol DJ went into the studio and mixed their songs. There isn't much new here. I know they re-recorded, but it just feels as if it was released for sales purposes. Track 3 and 4 are the best."
2,Jay Z - go away!,"Linkin Park is my favorite band. I love their music and how they can beautifully blend rock and rap. But Jay Z is a different story. He simply... sucks. His music is that horrible type of rap that I can't stand to hear. It's offensive and has offensive lyrics. Thats why I like Linkin Park, the rap in their songs is not offensive at all. I will always love Linkin Park and be a huge fan of their's, but Jay Z has got to go!"
3,Does the job pretty well,You do have to adjust the cutter so it cuts neither too deep nor too shallow. Once in a while it will start skating on the surface of the apple and you just have to push it in to get it to start cutting again. I had been cutting apples by hand and this was a huge time saver. The biggest problem is that the table C-clamp sucks bigtime. It's too shallow to get a good grip on the peeler.
5,perfect,"The apple peeler, corer, slicer was just as advertised. It arrived promptly in excellent condition, and was promptly put to work making applesauce. Gread product."
3,Apple Peeler,"I purchased this item and used it maybe 5 times. Already a small piece has come off and I have no idea how to put it back on. Since it is off the peeler can not be used.I love to cook with a lot of apples. Therefore I need something to speed up the peeling. This worked great when it worked!Of course, I have no idea if I had a warranty or where it is. I just thought this was such a simple tool that it wouldn't break! I didn't save anything. So, if you purchase this be sure to save all of your paperwork."
2,Description is wrong,"Despite what it says in the Amazon description, this model CANNOT core without slicing. According to the email I received from the manufacturer:""I am sorry but the 865 does not core only. We sell a coring attachment for the #864 or 861 and those are the only units it will fit."""
1,"REALLY BAD, BAD, BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",This movie is BAD!!!! I HATED IT! A poor dog is ALWAYS dieing in this flim! And SO many dogs that were suffering didn't get to a good home! And poor Buck(The star/dog-German Shepherd)Buck had to suffer in almost THE WHOLE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WHAT makes Jack London(The Writer) think that people wiil want to read or watch abused and dieing dogs????!!!!!!!! And at the end Buck's owner dies and Buck is left living with the wolves. Sure he's got a family. BUT he still could get shot and killed!This movie is NOT good for little kids! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!
4,Simple tale,I got this book along with several other that were recommended for my son's age group (9-12). The tale is simple but the imagery is powerful. I happen to love the older stories that harken back to a simpler time and this fits the bill.
2,not great at all,I can not understand whats great about this albume. Beside strange brew and sunshine of your love the rest of the songs are really poor and dull (nothing that can be compared to most beatles albumes unlike what one reviewer says). And those ones you can get on a 'best of' cd.. so good for 'collectors' but if youre interested more in listening to good music than having an exclusive rock collection save your money for stg else..
3,Disraeli gears,"Yes, I know - people keep telling me - this is an all time, bone-fide classic. And with this in mind, I bought it, listened to it and tried to disregard the hype that surrounds it and form my own opinion but its reputation got in the way and damn well ruined the whole thing.There is no doubt that in its day, this album was THE greatest blues-rock album created but I wasn't alive then and have been soaked in the 30 years of great ""Blues-rock"" albums that followed in its wake, which has served to make this one sound a little like all the rest. Love the cover though !"
5,Awesome and brilliant,"Disraeli Gears is def. one of the top 10 best albums of all time.Each artist a genius, each song a classic."
5,Talk about research...McMaster did it. A scary account..,"of how we (the people) we duped/fooled into one of the greatest tragedies in our nation's history. LBJ was not the ""victim"" of poor advice as is often conveyed by the Left. This is a balanced book. LBJ, McNamara ... , The Joint Cheifs, they were all complicit in this deception."
2,"Excellent research, ""dry-as-a-bone"" writing style...","Reminds me of the book ""One Hell of a Gamble"" on the Cuban Missile Crisis (masterful research, ""textbook"" writing style). I also must agree with some of the earlier reviewers of this book that nothing new is really presented here and the conclusions give no new insight into Vietnam. Disappointing and not really worth your time and money."
1,Nothing New Here,"Throughout the whole book, the author implies that if the politicians had just listened to the generals on the Joint chief of Staff, we would have won the war. Pure nonsense, those guys in the ivory tower didn't understand the nature of the war anymore than the author does. Much like the Germans after WWI, this stabbed in the back theory is a little old and counter-productive. LeMay and the rest of those WW II dreamers were completely ignorant of the political and nationalistic forces at work in Vietnam. Following their suggestions would have only escalated the war to include China. Those fools were even talking about using nukes. Was establishing a South Vietnam worth all that? No way, since the Domino Theory was pure wishful thinking on the part of the military."
5,Dereliction Of Duty,"An incredible book that will make your blood boil. This is a story of how narcissistic politicians and their inner circle put their own personal ambitions above the responsibilities of their office. The result was a terrible war and the deaths of 58,000 American Servicemen and more than a million Vietnamese."
5,*What a Masterpiece!* :-) *,"Oh my God, this is ABC's best album ever. Being an ABC and holding no mercy for their others albums, this is the only one that I can give praise to. All of the melodies and lyrics are breathtaking! This album has it's everlasting beauty. Such a huge shame that ABC didn't produce more albums like this until the late eighties. Something must have gone wrong? I guess Mark White wanted to have more of a hard rock band than what ABC should have been? Who knows! Anyway, everyone MUST buy this album. No one should go without it! Buy it now... :-) ABC forever!!!"
3,Marty's voice is fabulous,"Well...this is my favorite ABC album. Who from the 80's doesn't have memories that include ""Poison Arrow""? or ""Look of Love""? This is a very good album, but if you just like what was played on the radio back then, you should really give the whole album a listen. There are a few more good songs on it."
3,"Useful, but starting to show its age...","I recently used this text during my Menswear Marketing class. Pros: Quick and easy read; most concepts are clearly illustrated in line drawings. Cons: dated material; some concepts (such as personality types) seemed drawn out just to make the book longer. Suggestions: good if you like uncomplicated drawings as opposed to photos; works well if you have a professor to update the text verbally. For self study, check out: Dressing the Man : Mastering the Art of Permanent Fashion by Alan Flusser."
5,Real Fun For Kids Even If Your Not A Rugrats Fan!,"Though not a big video game player this game is as a matter of fact pretty fun for a kids game. The game is a whole lot better than ""Tomb Raider,"" & ""Metal Gear Solid"" which you have to spend days playing until the end & have to know every trick in the book. A big Rugrats fan myself I love this & the original game, ""Rugrats : Search for Reptar,"" they invole many small games which are fun & some chanllenging. If your one of those video game freaks who spends their whole day playing games it's a waste of your time & too easy, but if you have little kids & barely ever play your system I reccomend this."
4,A good ending,"I very much enjoyed all of Enright's books--both the Melendy series and the Gone-Away books. When I found out that she had three sons, I longed to get them together and ask, ""OK, which of you is Rush, which of you is Julian, which of you is Oliver?""I would echo the reviewer who says that the Melendy books would make a great TV mini-series, excpet that (having seen what TV did to some other classic children's books) I'd be afraid that they'd try to modernize them and mess them up. While the Gone-Away books could, perhaps, survive (they are far less time-bound), the Melendy books are tied very specifically to a particular time/place, and attempts to update would ruin them."
3,Pretty Good CD,this is pretty good CD it sounds allot like Creed meets 3 Doors Down meets Staind meets Nickleback it's an awesome CD for Hard Rock Fans
4,Lightweight as expected,I needed a very lightweight ball for PT after surgery. This performed as expected. Color was black / dark grey.
5,A great series so far...,"I really enjoyed this book because it brought out one of my favorite characters of the series, Lucifer. I felt so bad for him, being locked away in the salt mines with his poor wings rotting away... :( I really enjoy the relationship between Daemon and Lucifer, because they both love each other, yet hate each other. *Being brothers, and all* It makes it very interesting to read them interact with each other, and I can't wait for the next book. *Just to say, my favorite seen in the book was when Lucifer escapes the salt mines and makes a run down the canyon even though his power is running out and his wings can't support him anymore....LUCIFER! (( sob ))*"
3,true love,"I have enjoyed the The Black Jewels Trilogy, there is warmth and humour. Unforunately there does not seem to be much epic fantasy. The idea and plot are agreeable but the theme is not properly developed. Ms Bishop writes a great love story (romance novel) with a slight twist, but to place her in the fantasy novel genre is stretching the formula a little.The Black Jewels: Trilogy: Daughter of the Blood / Heir to the Shadows / Queen of the Darkness"
2,Sectional doors only?,"This is now operating my double-wide aluminum swing-up center pivot door. It is very poor for this use. It might not even work on a one piece wood door. Main problem; the track is not stiff enough. It flexes, sometimes 3"", the door bounces and the flex gets worse. BTW; the door is smooth and balanced. The 25 year old opener had no difficulty. This may be a typical problem for openers that must have a segmented track for packaging. I would have purchased a solid track opener locally but they cost twice what this one was from Amazon. Also if I had followed the geometry instructed the motor end would be less than 6' above the floor. This may be a cause for the track flex. jvm"
4,Exactly as ordered,"But difficult to install and this is my second one! A trouble shooting section would have been good! Otherwise, as ordered."
4,Garage Door Opener,Haven't installed this unit as of yet. However I feel that it will perform as expected. I've use this brand before and was pleased.
5,Slowhand by Eric Clapton,This was one of my favorite albums in the 70's. So when I saw it as a CD I had to have it. I enjoy listening to it in my car. Makes me in my twenties again. Love it now just as much as I did then.
5,Eric Clapton's Best,"Slowhand is not only Clapton's best, it is possibly the greatest album of all time. This is a classic album. It contains some of Clapton's best songs such as Cocaine, Wonderful Tonight, Lay Down Sally and The Core. This is the Clapton album to get."
5,One of his finest,"Slowhand is one of the milestones of Clapton's career. On this album you have some of the best songs he has ever recorded.Cocaine leads off and has been a signature song since this album was released, and remains one of his concert staples to this day.Next is Wonderful Tonight which is one of the finest songs of his career and remains a concert staple to this day as well.Lay Down Sally is next and spent some time on the charts in the 70's when this first came out.Clapton at this time was going through a country phase in his life and its shows.Next Time You See Her and We're All The Way are country songs.The Core is another of my personal favorites and is a solid performance.Mean Old Frisco is slide guitar at its very best. And finally the CD concludes with Peaches and Diesel.No Eric Clapton collection is complete without this CD."
5,Amazing!,"HOPE is one of my all-time favorite recordings, particularly the Lighthouse Keeper suite. Therefore, I approached this disc with some apprehension - how would it compare?To my utter amazement, I find that I actually like these recordings BETTER than what I've been listening to since Hope was released in 1977. Many of them sound much more natural, particularly the authentic harpsichord intro to ""Long Live Politzania.""To be sure, this collection is not for the Klaatu novice - if you are, you should probably start elsewhere."
4,Different take on Klaatu classics,"If you are new to Klaatu you should start with Peaks not here. That said this is a must have for all Klaatu fans! Some of the songs have a subtle difference, some others a huge difference. For instance the vocals are not as stunning on Calling Occupants as on the album cut, and Juicy Lucy and Mister Manson are dreadful renditions of the cuts we Klaatu fans are used to.However, the Long Live Politzania is better than the origional in my opinion. They left off one of my favorites A Million Miles Away thus the 4 star rating.Klaatu fans go for it, a different feel on some of our favorites, but well worth it!!!"
4,Excellent overview of the Dunns' Learning Styles,"This slim book is ideal for busy administrators interested in improving education. Key ideas based on decades of research into Learning Styles and inventory tools are presented very succintly. Low and average achievers make a greater improvement in standardized achievement test scores when their learning styles are matched, esp. through tactile, kinesthetic and global styles. Different alternatives for developing a Learning Style Program are proposed: workshops, self-teaching team, learning styles committee, hire consultants or a development team. Provision of matching resources will be an important next-step. There is a brief introduction to redesigning classrooms and teaching strategies. The practical questions that open-minded and dynamic decision-makers have to face are not no longer whether, but how they can find the physical, financial and personnel resources to implement such a daunting programme through viable, gradual and effective processes."
2,"""Just a Protestant from North Carolina""","Dont' expect much a concise history. Sometimes I feel like Franklin Graham is trying too hard with this book. The timing is confusing and it runs all over the place from Lebanon-Israeli conflicts that DARFUR type action.He's just as Catholic friendly as his Father has become, dropping not so subtle references to good works of Mother Teresa and the power of kindness over grace.A better read about Christian life would be the Men Hymn Writers or Biography of D.L. Moody"
4,Silver Sparkles!,"Sarabeth Silver is a teen who lives in a trailer park with hermom and cat, Tobias. When she transfers schools during the middle ofthe year, she starts to envy a clique of four girls - Patty, Asa, Jennifer, and her ""idol"", Grant. Sarabeth is taken by surprise when Grant ""adopts"" her and becomes her best friend, AND allows her into the clique.Sarabeth still favors Grant through her transition. But when Patty reveals a shocking secret to her they become very good friends, much to Grant's dismay. Patty's secret could force her and her mother out of their glamorous mansion or cause her more pain than she has ever experianced.This book was very good. The only complaints I have is that some plots were not developed fully and Patty's secret (I'm not a surprise spoiler!) was. . . well you'll have to read the book and find out!"
3,Silver for Silver,"The book Silver is about a girl named Sarabeth Silver who has to switch schools because she moves into trailor number two in her trailor park. Even though she isn't very wealthy, she meets a group of rich girls who accept her into her group. When she thought that everything was perfect, there was a problem with one of the girls. You will have to read this book to find out what happens!By Abby"
1,DIS-A-POINT-ED,"I have been a big fan of Ms. Henley for quite sometime now. However, I have really only read the more recent novels from 1990 and on. This particular book, I'm guessing must be while her style and talent in writing historical novels was in the developmental stages. The characters were vain, selfish, childish and absolutley ridiculous. Tabby couldent decide whether or not she liked, loved or hated Paris. It was really quite silly. So much so that I actually PUT THE BOOK BACK ON THE SHELF by the 76th page!!!! My favorite books by Ms. Henley are numerous, but this one had to be the worst of the worst."
3,Not her best by a long shot!,"I was quite dissapointed in this book and a little surprised. Ms. Henley is one of my fave's. While I do agree that this book was a little hard to get through, I wouldn't be as harsh as the previous review. I kept thinking that any minute it would get good but that minute never came. Definitely not what I have come to expect from Virginia, however, I have read several awesome books of hers and will continue to look for another in the same league as Raven and the Rose."
2,Not the Dead I love,"This is more funk than folk, more ""modern"" and less sixties than the Dead I love. If that is what you are looking for, go for it. But for fans of American Beauty, Reckoning or the other early records this will be more miss than hit."
3,Grateful Dead Terrapin Station,"Although, Grateful Dead is a ""Grate"" band live. They are not as good at making quality studio albums. This album lacks the character of their live performances. However, Terrapin Station and Franklin's Tower are good tracks to grove to on this album. All in all, I have to say three stars."
2,A very disappointing picture,"Someone was apparently aiming for another NORTH DALLAS FORTY when making this witless, badly contrived look at college football players, the brainwashing they face, their lives outside campus, and their coach. The pacing is way too slow, which unfortunately doesn't meet the standards of in-your-face football action which the major theme of the film (I guess) was supposed to be about. Every single banal turn that this ""programmer"" would make became completely obvious from the first few minutes. Also disappointing were the performances from the now-famous young stars, though under the circumstances Caan is OK. A pretty dull effort for all involved. In fact I wouldn't even blame the director if he wanted to throw all the copies of this movie out on the road and run them over!"
5,The best football movie made to date,"This movie isn't just a guy flick. I'm a 20 yr old female, this movie is one of my favorite. The plot is realistic and emotional. Anyone who played football in high school or college will relate to this movie. It opened my eyes to what really happens in a college football program. The acting is unforgettable."
2,Disappointed,"I bought it and the first week it was great. The longer I use it however, the worse the suction gets. Even when you clean the filters (all of them) its still poor. The suction on mine got so bad it wouldn't even turn the pet brush attachment. I finally took it apart to clean the tube from the tank to hose and it worked a little better, even though there was nothing much there!?! Not sure why that worked. Also, I hate the mess when you empty the container plus it holds next to nothing. Go with a bag or if you are lucky and building a house get a Central vacuum!! You won't regret it."
2,Horrible Vac,My wife decided to buy this vac since we have three dogs. It has been one of the worst vacuums I have ever owned. It has absolutely no suction power and requires constant cleaning of the very small debris catcher. Our [...]Dirt Devil still out performs this one. If you have kids and dogs this is not the vac for you. If your retired and have no pets or kids it may be alright.
3,One With Nineveh:More Bad News and Nothing Concrete to do about It,"One With Nineveh would be a good read for someone who hasn't heard about global warming or other problems encompassing the planet. The first chapter was interesting...the comparison between the lost civilization of Nineveh with today's world, but there was really no new information that hasn't been talked about since the early 1970's.The biggest disapointment was that there were no clear suggestions for people to do to live a simpler life, cut back on consumption, and in general quit being a pain in the back to the planet earth.One very good chapter towards the end talked about economics.....why societies do not have to have growing economies (production increasing every year, consumption increasing every year ect.). That chapter needs to be explored in greater detail by the authors as it was the most compelling idea in the book."
1,No new information,"This book offers nothing to someone remotely familiar with environmental issues. It might be a mediocre read for a beginner, but if you're already familiar with overpopulation, mismanagement of resources, etc, you will get NOTHING out of this book. It is incredibly repetitive and it lacks insight and depth. Don't waste your time."
3,Roaring Reptar,"This game is not the best game but it is still fun. It can get boring if you play it alot. I find it different beacuse you hunt areound Tommy's house for ""reptar bars"" and puzzle pieces. of course there are about two game in every room. The games are rated Easy, Medium or Hard. At first you van only do easy and medium but when you get about 3 puzzle pieces you can start doing ""hard"" The medium games usually has a set of challenges for you to do. Such as in Grampa's Teeth a goose has stolen Granpa's Dentures. You (Tommy and Chuckie) ride Spike through a hedge maze to find the goose. When you find the goose the goose takes Chuckie and then you must once again chase the goose. Most of the games are timed. I would say this game is good for 7 and up."
3,"Sugar Shock, but well worth it","In short, this film will give you insulin shock with how sweet it is. It's a romantic comedy in the classic Asian tradition. Two people are meant for each other and - time and time again - miss each other by inches. Fate keeps sending them in opposite directions and on a series of near misses. It's a fairytale and so light it will have you floating above your sofa after you finish watching it! It has some really silly comedic moments in it as well. Fans of When Harry Met Sally or Sleepless in Seattle type movies will dig this for sure. It helps if you are familiar (and prepared for) Asian film stylings as well. If you like romantic comedies, pick this up. You'll like it."
5,who is emma roberts?,"Emma Roberts came along way from Addie Singer, the young student who wants to be a singer in Unfabulous and became a movie star. Emma Roberts is an excellent actress, she has a long way to go, she's taking on serious movies. If Emma wanted to get out of her nice girl image in Nickelodean to serious actress the movie twelve will be the one to do that. Emma Roberts has the greatest resemblance of Shenae Grimes from 90210 and Avril Lavigne. I don't know what guy she'll end up with when she's an adult, but I know what the character Addie Singer would want Emma Roberts would want for a guy that she wants to marry. Perfect, the guy has to have a perfect job, perfect education, the perfect body, he has to be tough and rugged and has to do everything right perfectly. I don't know if that's this is the guy Emma wants, but the character Addie Singer would know what Emma Roberts want in a guy, the guy has to be perfect."
3,Average Sweet Valley book,"This book is about Michael (remember the whole Michael/Maria engagement story? This is the same guy) who is now dating a girl named April (who I don't remember from any other book.)Michael is obsessed with racing, and although April likes it as well, she'd like to do other things like go to the movies some time. Michael also hates a guy named Artie, who used to be his best friend, and is now his sworn enemy. So when April and Artie start hanging out, Michael is beyond [angry]. April decides to find out what started the feud to begin with. This is an okay book."
3,A good primer on various arts but mainly on jujitsu,Has nice clean line drawings. Has a decent amount of basic stand up jujitsu locks and throws.You will not find any ground work or defense however. Explains the various striking hand formations and ways to condition them. A quick and easy book to read and learn from.
4,Really Challenging Game!,"I love the game it is very complete etc. The Multiplayer playing is awesome. The negotiations are very ADVANCED you can select everything. But the graphics are not so good they are just some drawings. That is the only problem, the Multimedia is pretty good when you build something it even shows you a little movie clip about how it really is! also you have your own High Council that debates with you etc. It is a really fun game over all!"
5,BEST GAME IN THE WORLD,"Ever since the game was made, I have been addicted to it. Last year I played it for at least three hours every week night. And every weekend, I would play for the whole day. I know everything that there is to know about this game. If you have time, BUY THIS GAME! But, if you don't, you shouldn't buy it because you WILL become addicted."
2,Dont buy it,"Please dont buy it. I bought this one around a year ago. I live in upstate NY and unlike the metro cities cops and state trooper are rampant in my area. Now, this thing is suppose to detect cops earlier,right? wrong! it would beep 'occassionaly' and only when i can practically see the state trooper myself! so whats the point? actually there is no point (of buying it). Funny thing is now i drive at the speed limit (with the radar detector on). I am looking for a new radar detector now."
3,Not very reliable.,"I was not impressed with the Cobra. But yes it could save you some bucks, a court session, a lost licence, higher insurance. But don't rely on it and get silly thinking it will warn you. It can give you a few extra seconds. Best is to look at som eof the websites the test them like http://www.radarbusters.com/.Or maybe ... drive a bit slower?"
3,"Well, I liked it!","The Legen of Johnny Lingo was an imaginative and creative addition to a legendary story. I thought it was a heart warming fabulous movie. Keeping in mind that I am a fan of Disney movies, not action or adventure films."
3,Not as good as the first,"This is a great hardcore album, however it's not as good as the first album, atonement. It seems like they are trying too hard and lose the groove at times on this cd. Still, great positive lyrics, heavy heavy music, and c'mon, it's hardcore, it rules. If you like shai hulud, pick this up, you won't be disappointed, too much anyway."
1,CRAPPIEST STUFF EVER!!!!!!!1,"yo, i love hardrock, but this is the worst hardrock, hardcore, whatever that i heard. It sucks, I';d rather listen to N Sync than this crap. There is no tune to the song, and all he does is mumble, not the typical hardcore. my advise is : DONT LISTEN TO STRONGARM!"
5,Enthralled,"When I read Knight Triumphant, I knew that Shannon Drake/Heather Graham definitely had talent...that's what made me read this book. I was impressed with this novel as well. There were the initial conflict and somewhat dark undertones that keeps the reader engrossed in the story. I love the way she wove the rich history of the times into this story. I look forward to other novels by this author... I've scoured the used bookstores in my area and was lucky enough to find others."
1,I Hated It!!,"I don't like cruel, ruthless heroes who rape someone to get even with their enemy no matter how awful the enemy is. I don't like heroines who cry and moan rape and abuse but try to instigate the hero forcing themself on them again. This is pretty much what this book was. The hero imprisons and rapes the heroine, later on she is attracted to him and tries to instigates these sexual advances while still calling it force. The characters did not make any sense and the plot ran in circles until the conclusion. Needless to say, I won't be wasting my money on Shannon Drake again."
3,I thought it was okay,"I had to agree with one reader - I'm not fond of books where the hero forces himself on the heroine and then she suddenly discovers she loves him. Come on. This doesn't happen in real life (granted, we are to suspend disbelief since this IS fiction). I read this in about three days and have been thinking about it since I finished it. It's an okay book, but I don't think I'll run out and get the other two in the series. After pondering it for some time, I decided that there really wasn't much of a plot. She bored me with her detail of war and politics. I want a story. I want action. I want romance. Maybe I'm a different kind of romance reader - I *need* a story and more to it...That's it. In a nutshell."
4,This ring looks just like my friend Dana's engagement ring,"My friend got a ring for her engagement that looked alot like this. Except that hers has a big diamond and plastic band. Its not Titanium. I know that there are other sports teams that are out there with similiar NFL rings. But I picked this one, cause Dana talked about Pittsburgh twice today. She's never even lived there! I bet if she was a football fan she'd like the Steelers.Too late for you suckers not getting to Dana sooner. With this rock, everyone in LA will be completely jealous. Way to go kiddo!"
4,Fascinating Theories,Gilbert obviously put a lot of time and research into the theories in this book. Regardless of weather or not you buy into them this is still a well organized and thought provoking read. Egyptophiles and history buffs should find the historical narrative edifying.
5,One of my favorite designs..,"I've written other reviews for journals in this series, but this one is very pretty as well. The colors appear more ""jewel-like"" and darker in person. The design is ""raised"" and embossed, making them feel nice."
1,Who is this seller? Poor customer service unable to return item,"I received 2 children's watches. The Nike Triax Sweeper does not run and it looks like a used item, dirty band and label is partially torn off the back of the face of the watch. I tried x3 to contact this seller by using the tools at Amazon, unsuccessfully. There was only a rote email response stating it was being reviewed. I called 201 604 3656 to no avail. Message machine. Do not recommend this seller!!!Rate a zero."
2,"Great visuals, but truly ""silent""",I am always nervous when I purchase a copy of a silent film that those who remastered it would have chosen an inappropriate musical accompaniment. Imagine my disappointment when I learned that this fine Chaplin film had absolutely NO sound. Even in the Nickelodeons there would at least be a wheezy pump-organ to supply some sort of music to go with the action. Having no sound at all was distracting and greatly diminished the impact of the visuals.
3,The Tramp and the Kid who went on to play Uncle Fester,"The Little Man with the little mustashe stars in his classic and touching comedy, the Kid. He plays his legendary Tramp character in this story about a man who finds a orphan baby boy, left by his real mother, the tramp takes him in and raises him and loves as if he was really his kid, and the kid loved him. The kid is 5 years old in the movie, ,but when men from an orphange come to take away the kid, Tramp will not let them, he fights them off, they eventually get the kid and drive off, but our hero will never give up on his most important possesion and Tramp does get his kid back and the kid back to his da da, the kid was not his blood, he loved the kid and kid loved him. A happy ending, this is good for a silent movie and for a father and son movie, this is the silent Big Daddy, Chaplin is perfect father. mixing comedy and love between a father and a son makes this chaplin classic and a classic all around."
4,Peaches peaches. Love them Georgia Peaches,"This album is the last Duane Allman album. This album shines with One Way Out and it is a cover. Ain't Wastin' Time No More, the opener, is a good song. Les Brers in A Minor is a great instrumental, opening slow and going fast. Mountain Jam is a boring, very long jam. Melissa by Gregg Allman is a nice ballad. Blue Sky is also a good number from the Bros. All others are mediocre tracks to me but it is arguable."
4,Awesome,"""Go on downtime baby and find somebody to love... Mean while I ain't a wastin time no more..""I am NOT a southern rock fan. This goes way beyond that. It is almost white soul. This is a great, great album. I have had a vinyl copy for about 25 years. I just keep playing it."
3,"Not Fillmore East, But Okay.","If you grew up with the Allman Brothers recordings from the Fillmore East you may be disappointed. It's good music, and it contains some tracks you may not have heard, but it suffers in comparison. If you like The Allman Brothers this is a must buy. Just be prepared for some not so subtle differences in the songs you know so well.Yes, I know I'm being picky, but that was my impression of the product. The quality is good, the mix is as good as you're going to get live, and the song sequence makes sense. Overall it's enjoyable, and for me it's great road music, especially Mountain Jam."
1,Software issues,"I just bought this game and cannot install in on my mac because it says ""the classic environment is no longer supported."
3,Its alright,"Yes its nice that you can mix and match sounds. Yes it has alot to choose from. It does not, however, play loud enough for an adult (well at least this adult). The other thing is it feels and looks cheap. Overall I would not order it again."
4,A must have for a Colic baby,"I had such a difficult time getting my daughter to sleep and stay asleep. Well, I decided to try the sound sleep and my daughter loves the ocean sounds. She loves the constent noise. I would most certainly recommend this to anyone!!!"
1,Don't waste your money...,"I bought this before my daughter was born thinking that the ""heartbeat"" sound would be soothing for her. I liked this better than the teddy bears with the heartbeat sound because it also had other soothing sounds that my husband and I might enjoy as well.I hated every sound it made. The heartbeat was loud and annoying. All the other ""natural"" sounds seemed very unnatural and mechanical. My baby slept much better when I stopped using this. If you want nature sounds, I suggest you invest something other than this product.We now use an old clock radio tuned to AM static and it works better than anything else."
2,No White Noise,"I have two problems with this machine:1) There is no ""white noise"" setting. Only waves, brook, wind, womb, etc.2) The machine is not loud enough at the highest volume setting. The guidelines I've seen is that the white noise should be about as loud as a typical vacuum cleaner. This thing doesn't come close to being that loud."
1,Periodically makes loud thud sounds,"My only real problem with this product is that it will periodically, about every 20 min, make a thud sound that is so loud it wakes me up. Useless for a sleep aid because of this. I've read another review where it complained about a ""screeching"" sound. What is the point of making a noise maker for sleep if it's going to wake you up every 20 min? Do no buy."
3,Not loud enough!!!!,"Sounds and choices are great. The biggest problem is the volume. It's not loud enough. If you have a big bedroom, it's not loud enough on the other side of the room."
2,mom to be,"I received this for my baby shower recently and just set it up in the baby's room. I was very excited to receive this because it seems like something that would lull baby to sleep, creating calming white noise. The sound options are nice, but even on the loudest setting it is BARELY audible. The room must be silent and you must be sitting very close to it in order to hear anything. I would love this item if you could actually hear it, but unfortunately you can't. I'm going to bring it back and explore other options."
1,A big disappointment!,"We purchased this sound machine to use with our new baby. After just 6 weeks of use the machine started to make a strange electronic buzzing sound (not soothing at all), and then after 7 weeks started to turn off by itself immediately after we would turn it on. I wish I would have kept the box and the paperwork - I would have been nice to return it for a refund instead of throwing our twenty-some dollars into the garbage!"
1,broke almost immediately,"First child, very colicky! We tried everything to soothe our daughter to sleep, and knew white noise calmed her. I found this machine, read some of the good reviews and thought for $20, I'd give it a try.The sounds of ocean, rain and brook were really only the good sounds...and the machine worked great for about a week, but then would shut off after about 5 seconds every time since. Having suffered 8 weeks of sleepless nights, this machine gave me a short window of rest and hope, only to yank the rug out from under me again. Though our daughter now sleeps mostly through the night, I still try the machine every night in the hopes it will just WORK..."
3,Not loud enough,"It's been said by many other reviewers, but this sound machine was way too wimpy for our liking in the sound department. If volume isn't your concern, it should suit you just fine. The ability to combine sounds was novel, although I doubt my daughter knew the difference."
