5,Great product,"These are the original frisbees great fun for everyone. Quality is great. they fly fantastic, and they're easy to catch and toss."
4,"Good price, good cruiser, bad how-to","I was very satisfied with the bike that came to me. The paint was great, no scratches; the tires were firm, no holes and brand new; everything was just peachy. However, the bike came with absolutely no instructions on how to assemble it. The instructions that did come were for a mountain bike and I don't know about you, but I bought a CRUISER bike. The nuts and bolts were clean but very stiff and hard to screw on even with the right tools. I had to take my bike to the local bike shop to have it assembled, just to be safe. Very disappointed with the non-existent manual."
4,Great value,"The previous two reviews were really helpful.I've been looking for a lake-side-bike for quite a free days, and finally decided on this one. It was 99.99$ when i purchased it last week, including the free shipping. Arrived 2-3 days later on the same week. A pretty good deal! I've taken a long ride along the lakeshore, it's quite comfortable, also very pretty!! Especially good for ladies seeking for both comfort and style.I didn't rate it a 5 star only because it didn't come with the tools (like an allen wrench that always comes with furnitures), so you'll definitely need the following tools to assumble it:- a set of allen wrench- open ended wrenchAnd the instruction book was not very helpful. But it wasn't hard to figure out by oneself."
5,Thanks for the memory!,"I've said this in other reviews: I'm a cheapskate. I love bargains, and I love feeling like I've gotten more than I paid for. This memory made me feel great.If you're not a hardcore techno-nerd and you just want your computer stuff not to give you a hassle, this is the memory for you. I didn't do any bench tests and I can't tell you how it impacted my clock speed.However, I *can* tell you that it fit into the memory slots on my MacBook with ease. I can tell you that my MacBook recognized it on the first try. I can tell you that my MacBook now cruises through tasks it used to treat sluggishly, and it no longer gags when I have more than 4 programs open in memory. I don't do any hard core gaming on a MacBook (who would??) but I do some processor-intensive tasks with engineering spreadsheets and mid-level Photoshop, and it handles those things without difficulty.It's a great price for excellent memory. Buy some."
1,Product not delivered in specified time,Product not delivered in time .. Even the return courier was not picket by UPS.. Had to finally raise an RMA...
2,"Memory is great, Amazon experience not so much","Memory chip took 2.5 weeks to actually arrive from Amazon. I picked amazon because it was the best price, and it was actually in stock where with other vendors it was not. Yet astonishingly, I ordered from New Egg 3 days after Amazon when I learned of the delayed delivery date and despite not being in stock at New Egg, it arrived a full week before the Amazon order did.I tried to cancel the order a week in, yet since it had not been received I could not return it. And though it had not yet been shipped, I could not cancel the order. This is likely the last thing I will ever buy from Amazon."
4,Great cheap ram,"I purchased a netbook with only 1gig of ram which is not enough for those small little computers. I purchased this ram installed it in minutes, sped my computer up. Would recommend it as long as it is compatible with you computer."
3,Ok but god she's annoying,"The book is good and I generally love Deaver's final twists and turns towards the end but Rune is the most immature, annoying, stupid and obnoxious character I've read about. I have read all three books and feel that she is generally unsuitable as a lead character. All of Deaver's other 'heroes' are so clever and likeable, but Rune is just a careless person who reminds me of an annoying child who has no real skill as an investigator. All of the other characters in the book are really what keeps you going."
2,First effot by a stand out author,"Deavers wrote this book under the name of William Jefferies. He also wrote another series under this name featuring a film scout. This character is a young punkish girl named Rune who is trying to get through her 20's and survive NYC. She is currently working at a video store and when a regular dies under suspiciouscircumstances she becomes interested in the movie he rented numerous times. She becomes obsessed with plot of the movie as it is based loosely on a true crime. She thinks she can solve the case find the money and live happily ever after. This plot is hard to follow at times and sometimes I don't think the author is aware of what he wants the characters to do. I have read his later books and know he can write a good thriller. Too bad this book falls flat, I believe his publisher re-released to capitalize on his famous status. I will read more of the scout series and might try the next one in this series just because Rune is such a likable character."
3,"Great book, little too much trauma, over 18 only","I would have given 3 1/2 stars if I could. The story itself was good, although I felt one less traumatic event would have been ok with me. The author's cautionary note in the beginning doesn't go far enough. I thought it was too graphic even for me as an adult woman. I would not let anyone under 18 read it."
4,"Played homemade CDs, easy to navigate","My 4 year old niece loves it, and the homemade CD I made for her on it. I was concerned because some reviews said it didn't play homemade CDs, but it did. The sound isn't AWESOME, but she's 4, and it's not like she's a stereo buff. She just wants to hear Justin Beiber whenever she wants! When it gets too loud it gets tinny, but overall I am really happy with it."
1,Disappointing!,I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. We plugged it in and it never turned on! Apparently there is no quality control/testing of products before offering to consumers.
5,between heaven and earth; a guide to chinese medicine,"I found this book a very easy read for anyone wanting more knowledge on the foundation of tcm. I would recommend this book for any lay person, or people interested in studying chinese medicine.great!"
3,Only half a book,"This book only rates a 3 with me. While some of the information is good, I must agree with an earlier reviewer that the extreme focus on the five elements is over-done to the detrement of other topics. It is taken to such an extreme that the authors try to blend it with western 'new-age' thinking and creating ""elemental personality types"". Thereby, segmenting the mind from the body which they themselves state in earlier chapters is contrary to the TCM thought process. So again, 3 stars as I felt only half the book was worth wild."
5,Best Replacement Struts for Subaru,"Replaced all 4 struts/shocks on my 2000 Subaru Legacy wagon with KYB. The difference was like night and day; of course the originals were pretty shot after over 120K miles.These do give about an inch more ride height over the stock struts and can make installation a bit tricky. I did all four in the driveway on one afternoon. Just make sure you have a good McPherson strut spring compressor set and an impact wrench really helps out in removing the lower bolts, at least in my case.One tip, if you are careful about marking the lower bolt which is used to adjust the alignment, you can put them back in using the same orientation. I didn't even have to adjust the alignment afterwards."
1,Was Not Out Of The Box For More Than 30 Minutes!,"The Flow Pro is not a high velocity fan! There are three (3) speeds and when you switch through them they are not significantly different from each other. I judged the fan weak and not that of high velosity. I bought this because of a review I relied on. I was wrong, and the review was too generous. Don't buy this fan, it does not deliver."
1,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!,"Very disappointing season...... not enough action, too much stock footage. Geez they only have 30 minutes and fill up almost half with the Kenndy shooting? Are the writers on strike? Acting is dry even for a period junky like me!One show worth canceling. Sorry.... but the writer better get there butts in gear!"
2,Not what I paid for,"I love ""Mad Men"", and have wanted to start collecting the dvd sets for awhile now, but they have generally been priced higher than I wanted to pay. Imagine my excitement, then, when I found Amazon selling a new copy of season 3 for only $17.99- I was thrilled, but also cautious. I researched to make sure the packaging pictured on Amazon was the actual packaging for the dvd set- it was, so I placed my order. It just arrived yesterday, but instead of a boxed set with an episode guide, it's a black dvd case with 2 plastic trays inside to hold all 4 dvds. No episode guide, just the season 3 slipcover. It looks like someone put this together out of their home. I recognize I got a great deal, but if Amazon is not actually selling me the boxed set, then that information should be specified somewhere- I would have paid a little more to get the actual product instead of a homemade knock-off."
1,Where is my knife?,I haven't received the knife yet. You have my money. Do something about this failure.Herb Meyer
5,Excellent Knife,"This is THE knife that you will always grab when you want to dice, chop, pare, etc. Well worth the price!"
5,Excellent Knife for Peeling Fruit and Potatoes,"I purchased this paring knife in a 4 for 3 special about a year ago. (12/2010). My wife and daughter use it to peel fruit and potatoes. I still have to use a potato peeler. We have always found Chicago Cutlery knives to be sharp, functional, and durable."
5,Amazing adaptation,"When a movie can be a faithful adaptation and still retain its unique identity you know the creators have done something special. Omkara is lyrical, gritty and passionate at the same time. It's not your typical Bollywood material. Instead it transports you to a rural India where violence, politics, relationships and (mis)perceptions blend to create a tragic quadrangle. It has a brilliant cast, outstanding cinematography and direction and will leave you searching for more. If you like it check out Maqbool, Rajniti, Apaharan, Company, D, Sarkar and many other movies made in the last 10 years that have transformed the face of serious Indian cinema."
5,Father of the Bride 2,"Absolutely one of my all-time favorites... Everything, nearly every line in this movie is priceless -- charming, charming, charming... This is a real feel good flick... On the occasion I am feeling a bit down, I watch this and can't help but feel smiley again... I rarely actually purchase movies, yet, this is one I always have to have on-hand... :o)"
5,What a great movie!,What can I say but everyone loves this movie! My grandaughter watch it and part 1 over and over. I had to buy two!
1,Successful Loo84,"Secrets of the Millionaire Mind cards, are DREADFUL.I would definately NOT recommend ANYONE buy these cards at all. They are a complete waste of money and I will tell you why:EVERY CARD starts off with a positive statement, then ends in negativity about ones life and how you lived your life before changing your mind set.T Harv Eker is clearly a Millionaire by doing these cards and getting the general public to buy them! Good idea, I should have thought of that!!They are NOT helpful in any way shape or form. I dont appreciate being reminded about my previous life experiences via these cards. Amazon should take them off their site so that people do not waste their money. And thats the truth.These cards would continue to make T Harv Eker a Millionaire but not You or I! Cheryl Richardsons Daily Affirmation cards are more ""warm, inviting, friendly and CONSISTENTLY POSITIVE""!DO NOT BUY THESE CARDS, you'll be wasiting your money.thank you ."
3,"Hey, It's Megatron for crap sakes!!!!","My son is only 5 but he's dying to get his hands on this toy. He doesn't want to convert it to a plane, he just wants to get Bumblebee and Optimus Prime together to kick his butt!!! It's over-priced sure, but for the 30 minutes my son will take to destroy it....why the heck not. Yea, my kid is spoiled. He's all about Bumblebee anyhow!"
2,frustrating!!!,My son is 8 and this toy is bringing him to tears. He wants so bad to transform it and neither I nor his father can figure out the tiny graphics on the instructions. They should change the age rating on this toy or make better instructions. We have him partially transformed now and am putting a call into his engineer uncle to see if he can figure it out. My son is a whiz at lego instructions and other complex instructional toys so this is a big bummer for us and we are dissapointed!Buyer Beware!!
3,Fun for an eight year old.,"This toy is a lot of fun for my son. He has been heavily at battle with Optimus Prime. Megatron, sadly, has never been an airplane at my house. None of us can figure it out. My son said, ""It's ok, Mom. The robot is still cool. I mean, he's Megatron!"" Worth it to me."
2,"Good movie, download was poor","The movie was entertaining. The picture quality was good, however there was a significant amount of digitization throughout the movie as it was downloaded through TIVO. I paused the movie for over an hour and still had the issues even though I had the full movie downloaded. Not sure what the issue was, but the movie was relatively cheep for a rental and I pushed through anyway!!"
4,"Great Movie, Great Soundtrack","This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and (as far as I'm concerned) quintessential Cusack--mostly subtle between bursts of noise, melancholy yet ultimately upbeat. I love Cusack as a hit man--not because he seems like an obvious person to play a hitman, but because he seems like the last person in the world to play a hitman, and that's perfect for his apologetic-yet-defensive hitman character in the movie. I should also say that the soundtrack works PERFECTLY, and is worthwhile in its own right. I've never been a fan of Minnie Driver, but he's not horrible as the love interest in this movie, and Dan Akroyd (who I'm not normally a huge fan of, either) works as a hitman trying to get Cusack's character to join his hitman union (or else). A movie full of quirky, underplayed fun."
3,So far off the mark it's enjoyable...,"When I first saw this movie I was apalled at the blase way they aproach the subject of being a hired assasin. It was rather unfunny, and I have much more of a flair for romantic comedies and classics. However not being one to sit through movies and annoyingly say to those around me, ""That would never happen..."" For if it could happen it would be that much less entertaining. I did not and stomached the mediocriy of this black comedy. It was not enjoyable nor unenjoyable so I left it at the idea that i was never to see it again. However, I have a brother who persuaded me to do otherwise and the second time I saw it, much to my surprise, I cracked a smile. Then the third time my brother pleaded and cajoled me into watching his well loved movie I laughed and found myself... gasp...enjoying it much more than I wanted to. So the verdict would be, not good by a long shot but it definitly grows on you. Watch it in good cmpany and you'll enjoy it that muc more."
2,Gross Dumb and Blank,"This is a typical Cusak movie. Everything in this movie is to draw attention to him and make him look good. The hip eighties music, the droll but hip sounding conversation, the idea that Mr. Cusak has the skill to kill someone with a... pen, the romance of a sensitive killer going back to reclaim his high school sweethart, and finding meaning in the innocence of a baby's face. Don't fall for this hopeless, romantic ""bad-ass."" The premise for the movie simply doesn't work- the ""cold-blooded killer has feelings too"" theme. Only someone as pretentious and unfunny as Cusak could think like this. Somewhere along the line, the art of good movie making gets lost. That's what happens here and in all Cusak centered movies."
1,Don't bother!,"Reiterating what has been said before. Poetry requires formatting and if you can't be bothered to maintain the format, then don't bother to offer the book. Amazon should know better than to allow something sloppy like this, even if it is free!"
4,Nice!,Not what I expected but I was pleasantly surprised once they arrived. Delivery took forever because of the processing of the order...
1,Bland and boring,I found the characters to be one-dimensional. They were either all good or all bad. As a result they did not seem real to me. Real people are more complex. I have been reading mystery novels for over 30 years and this one was one of the few that I found it difficult to keep my mind focused on.
3,"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman Season Six","This is the second copy that I have purchased, It is not the problem of the seller, I have bought from two different places in two different states. But there is a glitch in the audio, I have tried this on 3 different players and the same audio problem happens on both sets..I have all the other seasons,there is no problem with them."
4,"Good season, but poor sound quality","I love every season of Dr. Quinn, so I was excited to be able to complete my collection with the final season. I had previously ordered it off eBay a year ago, but ended up returning it because of problems with the sound. So I waited and ordered off Amazon, only to discover that the same poor sound quality was still a problem a year later. The biggest problem is some loud clicks that randomly appear. Most of the time, they don't interfere with the dialogue. They are certainly annoying, but not enough to merit returning the season for a second time for a problem that doesn't seem like it will get any better any time soon.So, overall...the season is a good one. But the disappointment lies in the quality of the DVDs for this particular season that was put out by A&E.; It definitely needs to be fixed!"
5,EL ARTE EN LA ITALIA DEL RENACIMIENTO,"ARQUITECTURA - ESCULTURA - PINTURA - DIBUJO Edición de Rolf Toman Copyright 1999 KÖNEMANN (Versión española, 1994 la original)Distintos autores escriben los capítulos de este libro, cada uno fijándose en alguno de los aspectos del Renacimiento. Hay 4 capítulos dedicados a los distintos períodos en la arquitectura renacentista, 4 dedicados a la pintura, 2 a la escultura y 1 al dibujo. Es un libro de gran formato y muy pesado. La calidad del papel es muy buena, las fotos son muy buenas y de gran tamaño (muchas a página completa) y en el caso de los edificios, aparte de la foto hay pequeños dibujos de las plantas de los mismos. Por $ 31.96, me parece una muy buena inversión."
5,Amazingly soothing. (period),"You can simply place Rosa Passos' CD on your favorite player and let it gently (but surely) envelop you with total bliss.Her soothing voice accompanied by her soft classical string guitar will fill your place with the most pleasant feelings from the very first song.You may not even notice at first, but then you will realize that she's turned any day that you were having into a beautiful day. Her music is that pleasurable and subtle.In this CD, as others before, Rosa Passos remains true to her Brazilian roots, while reaching out and speaking with everyone in the world thru the universal language of music.As a lover of Brazilian Jazz, I can say that Rosa Passos tops the scale of cool."
4,A world of sins ... beautiful ones,Reading Jean Genet's books always makes me thrilled. He has the power of detailing stories after stories of sins. He also has the magic of transforming sins into beautified actions that everyone should have appreciated instead of detesting. His words are powerful and contain a seductive emotion. He also confess his love for male bodies in this kind of autobiography book. This work is one great masterpiece in my mind.
2,The end of Trace,"Trace Adkins used to be one of my favorite country singers, but some of his recent releases have drasticly changed that opinion. The song Honky Tonk Badonkadonk was the final nail in the coffen for for me. I can't see myself purchasing any more of his CD's.I prefer country music, not some cross over slop."
4,Trace Rules,"Good country cd. Love Dangerous Man, High, I Wanna Feel Something, Fightin' Words, and all the radio hits. Ladies Love Country Boys...so true and Trace is one of them, pony tail and all. :)"
4,FACM ( French Association of Country Music ),"There's no more excellent surprise than that new album from Trace Adkins. It his best with very powerful rock rhythms like in ""dangerous man"", ""ladies love country boys"" and the sublime ""swing"" (whose chorus strangely sounds like Trent Tomlinson's ""hey batter batter""!). But the ballads are still there and we can see that with ""the stubborn one"". Our favorite remains the spell binding melody of ""the southern Hallelujah"". Of course, the best studio musicians are there (Bryan sutton, Pat Buchannan, Paul Franklin). Excellent sound, excellent production and furthermore, the Cd exists in a limited version with a DVD which includes songs like ""Honky tonk badonkadonk"", ""Arlington"", ""and ""Swing"" in video version. Nope, nothing to throw away. A good production but beware ! Trace Adkins is a ""Dangerous man"" ![..]"
5,Great Book,We love this book at our house. It it full of great ideas to use as bedtime activities. my husband reads and does activites with our son from this book and they really enjoy the time together!
3,"Solid work, not as amazing as some of his other stuff...","Don't get me wrong, I liked this book and would recommend buying it. But if you're looking for the kind of 'yowsa' feeling that came from reading Broken Angels, it's not quite there."
4,"More Takeshi, but lay off the sex a bit","I rarely read ""series"" novels, as I tend to get tired of the main character, but Morgan keeps Kovac's adventures interesting.I also like the political undertones (much better done here than in, say, Market Forces, which hit you over the head with it).However, I'm no prude but I could do without the exceedingly graphic sex scenes. Sure, let 'em have sex, but it doesn't need to read like a porn flick. Would love to pass this on to my teenage nephews but this precludes that."
2,I don't think I like Takeshi Kovacs very much anymore.,"I really enjoyed Morgan's first two Takeshi Kovacs novels, ""Altered Carbon"" and ""Broken Angels,"" and I was really looking forward to this one. But ultimately I was disappointed. The protagonist isn't very engaging anymore, he just seems to be wallowing in his own bitterness. Maybe if Richard Morgan decides to write another book in this series, he'll present Kovacs with the greatest challenge of all: Finding some genuine love and happiness in his life. I also didn't think this novel ended very well, too many questions and loose ends."
3,Needs an Editor!,"This one is not as good as the first two Kovacs novels. But if you liked the first one you should probably grab this one too. The book starts great with some awesome classic cyberpunk sexy action but then it devolves rapidly (spoiler?) into this endless riff on Kovacs lost innocence and past lives.I felt like nearly a third of this book was Morgan searching for his character's motivation, which is not what I signed up for. Morgan does this a few times and it is repetitive and doesn't advance the plot enough to warrant the amount of pages he uses to explore TK's feelings. I don't really care *why* TK has to take out some resleeved yakuza skull tank surf droid. I am much more interested in *how* he does it.Bottom line: If you liked the first two TK books this one is worth it. Just don't feel bad if you want to skip over some of the dull parts."
3,"Slower than the first, and def not worth $12.","Seriously don't know what they think they are doing. I had to get the book elsewhere. If you know where to look, it's $7 elsewhere. It's a bit slower than the first, and way overpriced."
2,Woken Furies,Much less edgey than his previous works. Typical third or fourth sequels. Still action filled and Sam Spade like.
5,great book,"it is one of the most essential books you should have , it is easy written and easely to study from."
3,not great,"Well priced and comfortable, after a few months of occasional use, (maybe once every 2 weeks) it has begun to fray around the edges. It was well priced so I guess cant complain much but it has not even been washed yet."
4,Rebirth Represents! ! !,Great live sounds from a great brass band. It's fun ... classic jazz brass kickin' it live with a bit (too much) flava at times. A whole lotta kick-as* horns in your face. It'll make you feel like you're dancing with the band at The Leaf. Gave it 4/5 because there's a bit too much singin' on a few tunes.
5,Great brush,"I've been using this more than I thought I would. It works great at cleaning glasses or dirty dishes before you put them in the dishwasher. The one drawback is that it slings water but that's a non factor really and expected since it spins lol. You shouldn't be disappointed with buying it, I'm not."
4,Metric tape,"Hello ,I purchased 2 of these , they are sturdy and lever lock .I switch numbers around , especially when I'm tired so a metirc tape is better for me.If you need to be accurate on the frist measure metric is best.It is not a contractor grade tape but very good around the house ,or shop."
3,Conair,I ALREADY OWNED THIS MOVIE ON DVD SINCE THE PICTURE QUALITY WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY SO i BOUGHT THIS BLUE RAY DVD THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE PICTURE QUALITY EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE RECENT MOVIES
4,"everyone's ""favorite movie!""","ok, well let's step aside from all of the brainiac responses. people can't take away anything from a review if they can't understand the terminology.con air is a pretty action packed movie. nicholas cage plays a pretty good role, though sometimes his hillybilly accent drives me nuts. the plot is typical action moiveish, but i like it. the budget for this movie was well, quality is great. con air is alot of people's ""favorite movie"", and with a script written so well, i can understand why.this movie has a little bit of everything nestled in. you've got plenty of comedy and laughs, some dry humor, some serious action that'll have you on the edge of your seat, and even some drama. the ending will leave you with a sense of relief. yes indeed, this movie combines many theatrical attributes."
4,A guy movie.,"My husband added this to his video collection. It's an enjoyable movie, but more of a guy movie. A little too intense for me at times."
4,he ain't an ex -con he's the saver of the day,"cameron poll was in prison for a self defense murder, 8 years later he is realised by plane but all hell brakes out when the plane is hy-jacked by a load of mean ex-cons. cameron decides plan afer plan to get the plane stopped by the police, non of his paln works out until he decides for action in the plane, the film is practailly not at all viloent, it has many funny scenes and action scenes."
5,Excellent; FANTASTIC,"This is an awesome film. Somewhat old, but dam the action doesn't stop coming, I highly recommend you watch this. It is great.I can honestly say this is a film that NEVER gets boring.Excellent qualities, mixes love and blood curdling fights well!I've just ordered it on DVD"
4,"""Welcome to Con Air""","...John Malkovich's character (Cyrus the Virus) announces after taking over a state of the art prisoner transport plane. This and many other lines help make Cyrus one of the most charismatic and lovable convicts I've seen in a long time (he is the bad guy in the movie though, but I can't help but like him). There is tons of other great characters in this movie as well, many of them covicts. Nicholas Cage, John Cusack, Steve Buscemi, David Chapelle, and Ving Rhames are all solid as usual.Yes this is standard Jerry Bruckheimer action fare, but that's not a bad thing. It's a movie made to entertain and that's it. There is loads of comic relief and pleasantly cheesy dialogue that helps to make sure you don't take the film too seriously. As mentioned by others the Unrated Extended Edition DVD has absolutely no special features, which is a little disappointing, but the movie by itself is worth the price regardless."
2,Working-class Fugitive,"Con Air is a basic, high-explosion variation on ""The Fugitive"". The talented cast is a case of overkill: Con Air character roles call for nothing more sophisticated than caveman-like violence, a' la late night wrestling.TARGET CROWD: Con Air will probably appeal to people who like their action flicks loud, explosive, direct, all-American, and uncomplicated. The good guys win, the bad guys get massively punished in the end .... and hey, that's it.THIS FILM IS NOT FOR YOU IF: Avoid Con Air if you prefer thinking persons' action films, and if you're tired of formula Hollywood films. This is not a sophisticated movie."
2,A bad story,"The story ""intentionally"" pack all heavy-weight criminals/prisoners on a plane - What can go wrong? What will happen when there is a hero on the plane? This is a bad story that is nothing new or surprising. It has lots of actions, though."
3,natural product,"I like that the product is safe and natural. I also like that it does gently scrub your teeth as you chew. At first, the taste is okay at best. The texture is a bit odd. The gum has a hard shell and is softer inside. After chewing it for about 10-15 minutes, the gum becomes so soft and sticky you have to spit it out. It also gets an odd flavor around the same time. The cinnamon flavor is about the same as the mint. I do admire their efforts in creating safe and natural products, but they need to be a little more palatable."
4,The best of the breed,"I think of all the teen dramedy movies of late, this is the best. Probably because it has the highest ratio of people that can really act in it, and possibly because Freddy Prinze has nothing to do with this. The actors actually develop tensions between each other. The music generally fits the events of the movie, rather than giving the feeling that they threw in any old hit song. It still feels like a teen movie, but I think it tries a lot less hard to be cool to the teens. Maybe it is just not so noticeable. There is no extra maturity, or complexity, but I think that is due to the stars abilities. The extra DVD features are lacking, but I definitely recommend this movie."
5,A Great Spin On Shakespeare,"10 Things I Hate About You is a funny yet smart movie that is great. What make it even better is that it is loosely based on the Shakespearean play, ""The Taming Of The Shrew"".Newcomer Heath Ledger(Patrick Verona in the movie) shined. I totally fell in love with the character of Kat(Julia Stiles). I think she is someone alot of teens can realate to. And when you add Joey(Andrew Keegan), Micheal(David Krumholtz) and the rest of the cast to the mix and what you get is a hilarious, sexy comedy."
2,Falls apart after a promising first half-hour.,"The writers do a terrific job of setting up the premise of a high school so ruled by cliques that it even has a sizable cowboy crowd, and the actors--Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles, Larry Miller, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and especially Allison Janney as a wisecracking guidance counselor--are as charming as they could possibly be. Unfortunately, the writers--having taken ""The Taming of the Shrew"" as the template for their story--run out of direct parallels to Shakespeare early on, and they can't replace them with anything except the usual, tiresome teen-movie cliches and leaden, disposable dialogue. Worst of all, Janney--whose presence really enlivens the early scenes--disappears before the movie is half-over. This movie was a big disappointment to me, but I wish nothing but great things for these wonderful actors."
4,Very good.,This film is a very smart and charming film. The acting is good. The dialogue is funny and also very clever. The way the actors deliver the great lines is what makes the cast very believable in each situation that they are in. The movie is entertaining and Julia Stiles has a spectacular performance. All teenagers have to like this movie because it is romantic and it deals with situations that teenagers face in their everyday life. It is worth the money.
3,Typical teen types,"I was curious to see how a Shakespearean work (The Taming of the Shrew) would work in the teen romance genre.While it isn't a movie that I can recommend to other adults, it was amusing and well written for the younger crowd.Each of the actors creates a character of some depth and manage to knit together an ensemble that makes sense in the world of true teen love.I have to say that although I got it for my kids, I enjoyed it as well."
4,I could not find ten things to hate about this movie!,"I really liked this movie. The father was a crackup, i loved how he used ""teen lingo"". Julia Stiles made an excellent screen appearance, as well as the person who played Mrs. Perky, the guidence teacher. Larissa was a wonderful ""popular girl trying to show that she's really a person"". Heath Ledger, um, he was one thing i DISLIKED about the movie. His acting was poor, and he was not very into it. Levitt, who played Cameron, was a very good nieve little boy. As for his sidekick, whom i haven't seen since ""Life With Mikey"", was funny as usual, and i was glad to let him back onto my TV screen. The plot of course was predictable, but the song from Letters To Cleo (Want you to Want Me) made the whole thing worthwhile watching to the end."
3,Region Codes?,"Our DVD player would not play this DVD saying it had an error and that it couldn't play because it had an inbedded region code. However, we were able to play it in our laptop. Disappointed in inconvenience."
4,Sooo much better than other teen flicks!,"10 Things I Hate About You is probably the best teen flick since Clueless, and definitely the best of the pay-you-fifty-bucks-to-get-that-girl(or guy) movies. It's cute, charming, and (omigod!) funny! Not to mention pretty romantic."
5,!0 great things about this movie,1. Great Actors/Actresses2. Great interpretation3. Funny4. Intriguing5.HEATH LEDGER!!!!6.Romantic7.conflict8.sibling rivalry9.modern10.fun to watch
4,Very Entertaining,"This was a very entertaining movie. The characters are lovable, and the actors are very well suited for their roles. The ending is a little predictable, but otherwise, a great film"
5,This is a GREAT movie! Shakespeare? Witty? DUH!,"Shakespeare is, like, the best playwrite ever. This adaption is not only true to teens, but also to the base of ""Taming of the Shrew""! To the one who said sexual inuendo every three minutes - i hate to tell you, thats only at the beginning, and then it is hillarous! And definitly ""true"" to teen's interpriatations of life!If you don't buy this movie, then you missed out on something great."
3,Fun But Predictable,"10 Things I Hate About You is another variation of Taming the Shrew and generally succeeds in its attempt to keep things light-hearted and humorous. Its strength is in its script since it is brimming with dry humor about our modern teens.Yet, where this movie falls flat is in its insistance on staying true to Hollywood forulas and making a forgetable carbon-copy of so many other boy-meets-girl stories.A good movie to watch on a date, but it won't stand the test of time."
5,Wow...Definitely a must see movie,"I saw this movie a couple weeks ago and totally fell in love with it and it's characters. Yes, I am a teenager, but I also understand that many adults (including my parents and sisters) have enjoyed it. Any teenager that watches this movie can relate to something, which is one reason I found it so interesting. I think many viewers find themselves totally interested in one character and paying attention to that one throughout the movie, hoping he/she gets what they want. Also, the acting in this movie, was awesome. The casting director needs some kind of award for this, because the teenagers portray their characters very well. If you haven's seen this movie, you must see it. Maybe some people find it to be a bad movie, but I think most of you will be very interested in it and want to watch it again and again."
5,the best sleep-over film.,"I thought Julia Stiles was a superb actress in this movie.It's a movie where you know what happens at the end,but you keep watching because it's so good. My only complaint was that it had too much obscene language.Most teens talk like that but it's sending the wrong message when your role models have such a trash-talking character. This movie is definetly one you can watch every day and never get tired of it. It's the all time sleep-over movie."
1,"A ""comedy"" likely to produce suicidal tendencies","I saw this movie at a drive in theatre and was tempted to connect a hose to the exhaust pipe, feed it through the car window and start the engine. Carbon monoxide poisoning is a merciful escape from the sight of Schwarzenegger going into labor dressed as a middle aged woman. Oh, the humanity!"
1,Proof that even Arnold is capable of making a horrible film!,"If there was ever a time I wanted to walk out of a movie theater, this was it! But I wasn't alone, and therefore couldn't just leave. It was a horrible experience, watching this stupid movie!"
4,Funny Yet A Powerful Message,"This is personally one of my favorite Arnie movies. It is funny, Arnie does a great acting job and it is very powerful in its message of the sanctity of life. I remember many scenes from this movie and really enjoyed the progression of Arnie's pregnancy both physically and emotionally. All cast members do a great job.I highly recommend this movie. Even though its been several years since i have seen it i can recall so many scenes. I especially remember the scene when Arnie decides to continue the pregnancy after learning he was pregnant-very subtle but powerful.Check it out--- you'll be back"
5,FILM SCHOOL VS MOVIE SET 101,"Why spend thousands of dollars on film school when you can learn everything you need to know for $17.95 on MOVIE SET 101? A certifiably great book, intensely well-researched, full of valuable info for the rookie and veteran alike. A must have!"
5,Top Notch!,This is a great book. Even if you already work in film and tv there's something unexpected to be read. It gives you a really good heads up about on-the-set mayhem you could never really anticipate and wouldn't expect until it happens. Invaluable stuff.
3,Good as a study of film-making,"As a semi-professional video producer who has a limited budget, I bought this film as a study in how to effectively produce a narrative movie for little money. It was important for me to hear first from the filmmaker what constraints he had, and the tricks of the trade he employed in order to get the job done, and THEN watch the movie. For a jaded media junky, the movie itself is not groundbreaking and the acting is subpar at times, so the sheer entertainment value is where I rated the 3 stars."
3,Nothing Special,"I love this movie for its simplicity, location and photography.image quality is average.No difference between the regular issue (the Desperado / El Mariachi editon)and this so called special edition, except for the previews of Roberto Rodriguez's other movies."
1,Shattered glass on 1st use,Well received the unit today. The screw for one the lamps is too short to mount to the rails. Used one lamp for sheetrock work. The glass shattered after 10 minutes of use from the heat. Tripod screw loose. Will request a refund.
1,Only 3 songs?,Wow. I would'a bought this 'cause I like the song. She's got great range and impressive diction...but I'm not into ripoffs. Rather support a down and out folk singer with my money.Thanks to whoever wrote about the 3 songs. Bless you my son!
1,Not a rap fan,"I thought I was downloading the version on ""Rehab"" that has been played on the radio. I did not like the rapping by JAY-Z. I am not a fan of rap. If you want the original version of ""Rehab"" look for the album ""Back to Black""."
5,It works.,I usually not a big HP fan. But I took a chance and have not been disappointed yet. I use it with the ibook G4. Very easy to pack up.
1,poor service,"Well, I'm extremely disappointed, I received the product and returned it, Im still waiting for refund, I will never purchase a used item again, my printer did not work and it didn't have everything needed to see if the printer actually worked, I received no power cord with printer no kind of paper work no instructions of loading device. I'm very sorry however, I'm out of the money I paid for merchandise, and I sent it back and still waiting for refund and have not heard from seller."
5,HP Mobile Printer Review,"I have a hobby of scoring Sailboat races and often travel to different locations to score regattas. I had several bad experiences relying on the printers provided by the sponsoring Yacht Club so I purchased this printer to be self reliant. This printer has worked GREAT. Good quality print, reasonably fast and easy to carry around. I highly recommend it."
3,"Decent quality, but runs small","I dont really wear mine all that much because these leave the bottom portion of my ears overly exposed. I kind of have big ears i guess. The material on this is average, and it doesnt fray and break after washes, which is nice."
2,Great hat for small heads,"I know I was taking a chance buying a beanie online, but it was a great price so I rolled the dice. The quality of the beanie is great; it looks like it would last for a long time, and I really like its looks.And I do have a decent sized dome (7 1/2 in fitted hats). But this lid fit my one-year-old son's head better than it does mine. It kind of sits on my head like a yarmulke, barely covering my giant bald spot.So if you're concerned at all about it being too small, it probably is. If you've got a smallish noggin, this would probably be a sweet beanie."
4,Good for programmers new to FoxPro,"When Access totally bombed out on a very large dataset, I found that I needed to know FoxPro 5.0 yesterday. It was extremely helpful, and gave me the basic commands that I needed to continue the work. It is a good introduction, but stops short of anything but the rudiments of the programming language."
4,A hint of the Odyssey,"This Little Golden Book revolves mostly around Phil, Hercules' little satyr friend. While Hercules is taking the day off, Phil has decided to take the day off, too. He boards a boat and eventually hears the mermaids singing for him which, of course, causes all sorts of problems including the attack of a sea monster. Have no fear...Hercules is here. Hercules saves the day, just as a hero should do. There is not much of a plot, which might be perfect for younger children. The illustrations by Cardona Studio are crisp and clear."
4,Non-elegant but interesting,"This book was composed by a friend of the subject some twenty years ago but not published till 2002. But it is not hagiographical even though the author, now deceased, knew Jeannette Rankin. Most people know that Rankin voted against war twice--even though she only served two terms in the House, having been elected in 1916 to her first term--the first woman elected to Congress--and then elected to her second term in 1940. So when Pearl Harbor was bombed she was the only person who voted against war--though a few days later she voted for war against Germany. She was somewhat eccentric and was active in the anti-war movement during the Vietnam era though not in full sync with the moving spirits in that endeavor. She lived on till she was almost 93, active and forceful till the end. While the book has no footnotes and is kind of amateurishly written it tells an interesting story, and gives a fuller picture of an amazing woman than most folks have had hitherto."
3,O.K. Watch,"This watch is nice, big easy to read dial, comfortable strap, not to heavy,keeps good time, a little to plain for my taste but good for work or something. My only two problems are, I miss the date window, didn't think I would, but I do, and the crysal scrathes so easy, after only a few weeks it can get hard to read. Like it's covered in smudges from my kids or something(It's not by the way, haha, I have cleaned it). It your not looking for fancy chrono's and the like, you will probably like it."
3,good basic trickle charger...but watch the battery rating!,"I bought this charger because I wanted a slow, trickle charger...its rated for ~14.5 hrs for 2100 mAh NiMH batteries. The advantage is that the batteries stay cooler, which is better for the device they are going to be used in. [NiMH batteries can get up to 140 degrees when fast-charged].Amazon's product description says the batteries are 2100 mAh, but mine were only 1700...a big difference, especially when NiMH batteries lose about 1% of their charge per day. Amazon was very good about helping me correct the problem, but be aware that this may happen...you may want to get additional 2100 [or even 2300 or 2400 mAh] batteries just to be safe."
3,Kind Of A Mess,"Amazon Women On The Moon starts off fast and funny, but ends up being kind of a mess. It probably has something to do with the fact that it has so many ideas and directors and writers. Probably the best part for me was seeing Sybil Danning in a couple of scenes. I'm a fan of hers, and her movie ""Reform School Girls""."
1,Too Little Too Late,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I can appreciate satire and comedy skits but this collection of skits surrounding snippets of a campy space movie just doesn't work. Individually some of the skits are good or at least mildly amusing; like ""Two IDs"" starring Rosanna Arquette and Steve Guttenberg about a fact checking machine that does a history analysis of a man's dating history to let user's know if he's a good candidate. Or Ed Begley Jr. as the ""Son of the Invisible Man"" who doesn't realize he's not invisible and runs around naked.The best part of the movie was looking out for the familiar faces, some who were popular in the 80s and some who are more popular now. They include the likes of Arsenio Hall, Phil Hartman, Michelle Pfeiffer, Peter Horton, Griffon Dunne, Joe Pantoliano, Joey Travolta, Steve Allen, B.B. King, David Alan Grier, Kelly Preston, Marc McClure, Carrie Fisher and more. If you're into campy this is it."
1,this sucked,"If this is a cult film, I do not want to be a member of that cult. Somewhere along the line I must've read a review that praised this bore-fest and I'm sorry that I did. Don't waste your time."
4,"Quite enjoyable, and quirky!!!","A very clever collection of shorts put together in a way that they seem to flow together, even though most have nothing in common, Amazon Women on the Moon is a very fun movie to watch. It has a long list of talent in its cast including Arsenio Hall, Michelle Pfeifer, Joe Pantoliano, Steve Guttenberg, Roseanna Arquette, Carrie Fisher, and Andrew Dice Clay.The scene ""Blind Date"" which stars Steve Guttenberg and Roseanna Arquette is worth the price of the DVD itself. It is absolutely hilarious. I would consider it my worst nightmare (at least in dating terms).Parts of the movie are ridiculous, but for the most part it is very enjoyable. The best way to watch this is to go into it with an open mind and don't expect it to be realistic."
4,What's in it,"This DVD contains the following episodes (9):Decorating 1.29.54George's Old Flame 7.2.54Henrietta Sells The House 4.9.54The Proposal 2.19.54Second Honeymoon 1.8.54Sweepstakes (A Ghostly Joke) 5.7.54Topper Goes to Las Vegas 4.23.54Topper Goes West 4.30.54Trip to Lisbon 2.12.54This is A Platinum dual layer disk (DVD9), so there is a Platinum leader on each episode as well as the logo in the lower right corner.Video quality is good to very good as is the sound.I bought it for the first episode (Decorating). If not for that go with Critics Choice Volumes One and Two. They contain 8 of the 9 episodes above with the exception of Decorating."
5,"It seems I am the only one that aged over all of the years that have passed ""Since"" this ran on television.","This DVD was priced right, shipped fast and arrived undamaged/well protected against damage. Good competitive pricing via the vendor I purchased it from as well, MovieMars the vendor via ""Amazon.com"".....Contains quality video of the old shows and even some commercials too. Somehow I have yet to see a ""Repeat"" from my memory of the show as well so given that I was prepared to see many episodes I had seen earlier when it ran on television it was a good thing in my opinion, I have not completed viewing this DVD at this time however I am sure I will be happy with all I view on this DVD."
4,Magic?,"Recorded live at the outdoor dance pavillion of Coney Island amusement park. Some playful piano solo work which may or may not be Kenton (I've witnessed him doing similar stuff) only time I have heard vibes with a Kenton band. They work well. Jerry Lestock McKenzie is the listed drummer but ""Johhny VAN Ohlen is credited for performance on A Train - Von Ohlen would have been in high school in Indianapolis at this time - guest spot for a talented kid and something Kenton did with regularity. Not a prize, but a rewarding curiosity. NOTE: The Mellophoniums were legend for pitch problems. On this set it is the sax line that is having the trouble."
4,Wonderful compilation!,This collection of precious nuggets from amateur writers of Indian origin is a delightful read. The authors' sheer love for writing is reflected in the many diverse pieces featured in this book. Sulekha has truly proven itself to be THE forum for people all over the world to celebrate their common Indian bond.The editors have done a great job in providing for a wonderful variety in the content. This book is going to be a stocking stuffer in a lot of my friends' households this year for sure!
2,Not worth the money,Pretty tame stuff here. Some of the women are tattooed up - if you like that sort of thing. Not a pretty sight in my opinion. Overall = boring and not worth the money.
3,Doggie Sun Visor,Glasses are well constructed but I never could get them adjusted so that my Shih Tzu was comfortable. She normally will wear what ever you put on her.
1,What happened to RACING?? (and all the other characters!),"What ever happened to all the characters, like Tor, Len, Sam's baby ect. ect! Have they disapeared off the face of the earth?? I have been reading these since they first came out way back when, and none of these books recently even compare!! They are the Throughbred series, about racing, not jumping ect. Cristina is a ""snob"" most times, and she always goes on and on and on and on..... about STERLING!! I wish that the books would be about racing, Wonder's books, and Pride book's were the best, and none have even come close!! BRING BACK RACING!!!!!"
2,Pretty good book,I wish (like many others) that Joanna would continue writing the books. I've looked ahead in the series and she has about 5 different writers she's trying out! . I also wish that they'd ad more feeling to the books. Like the earlier ones (before christina was born) were very hard to put down and they really gave you an idea of what was happening. I like some of the female writers but I wish Joanna would write them. What's up with that anyways? I never figured out why. I mean if she creates them then hey why not write em' ? Well hope this has been helpful!
5,Collect the whole set!,"What a great product. Our little girl got the other two Eanie Meanies from her aunt and uncle as birthday presents and we just had to get Moe to complete the set. The Eanie Meanies are rated for children 3 - 7 but we feel they are completely safe for our one-year-old. All 3 dolls are comletely soft except for the black pupils of the eyes which are fastened thru the cloth, not glued on."
5,A Must Have,"I ran across this text in the OR nurse's lounge and found it highly fascinating. The other nurses recommended it to me, so I hopped on Amazon and found one. The prices have come down tremendously since last year. This text is not full of PhD jargon. It's well-written, easy to understand for someone with just an LPN background. I really like it."
5,surgical textbook,The text was in excellent condition and I received it in no time at all.It has been helpful in my new work assignment. I don't know why I don't think of this first for all my music and book requests.
5,Still stunning after all these years,"I have listened to these performances of the Bach unaccompanied violin works by Henryk Szeryng for over 30 years, and still have the LPs. Szeryng's performances are simply riveting, and the works themselves remain incomprehensively transcendent. I recommend listening to these recordings in a setting where you will not encounter interruptions -- just let the performances sweep you away. Simply stunning...I never tire of listening to these."
3,Has to tell time,"The company was great and the product was great too, however try to avoid getting the motion charging one. I wear this watch once a week and every time I wear it i need to reset the time. I would only recommend this style if you will wear this watch everyday"
3,Good everyday use watch,"The Invicta watch is defintely worth the price paid. Looks good and has an appealing face. Some negatives: the watch feels heavier than previous wrist watches I have owned and is a bit thicker than I would like. Also gains a few minutes a week. Nothing catistrophic, just a small irritation!"
2,"Avoid the ""automatic""","I recently purchased this as a daily beater watch that can be worn to work. I read the reviews and had some concern with the automatic but decided to take my chances. Now I am preparing to box it back up to send back. This morning was the 4th time I had to reset the watch in just two weeks. This is with fairly steady usage. However, if you don't wear it one day, then it will stop. That defeats any practicality for this watch. Today was the second time where it didn't make it overnight- the kinetic storage for this is just too small.That being said, I like the looks and style, build quality seems fine (other than the automatic function). I am taking the return money and getting the quartz version so I can have a watch that does something radical.. tell you the time when you pick it up off the table."
5,Suitable quality for reasonable price,"This is a good choice for those who do like performance of Diatonic, but who hates to be stuck in two and a half castrated octaves.Here we have at least three complete octaves (with bending and without overbending).Key G is great for German Military Marches and folk music."
1,Ugh,"Overproduced. The first single, All About Us, was great. Everything else was way overproduced and her voice was not showcased as it should have been. Too much Scott Storch and not enough Brooke Hogan."
1,THE END OF AN ERA,"What's that awful screeching noise you hear when you turn on Brooke Hogan's CD? I'll tell you: It's the music industry scrapping the bottom of the barrel of the Pop Princess Era. The last time I heard such a ghastly sound was in the sad final days of the Boy Band Era; the group was called O-Town. God bless Brooke, I'm sure she is a lovely young woman but she is not a legitimate recording artist."
2,Hogan Does Not Know Best,"For those who have watched the reality show Hogan Knows Best, you will already know Hulk Hogan's daughter Brooke is TRYING to have a singing career. Well after listening her first CD, my suggestion is retire now!Scott Storch has beeen a decent music producer. However his sound choices may come into question, when you judge the merit of this CD.However, there are two great cuts on this CD. A Nelly Furtado written Heaven Baby (which sounds like Nelly leftover which was left off her HIT CD) which Brooke does a nice job mocking Nelly's style and sound. The other is the hip hop-ish Incognito, which has a nice beatBrooke Hogan can keep a tune better than Paris Hilton and just under Traci Lords (remember her disco type single many years ago).After listening to this weak effort, I have to ask HULK HOGAN a really big favor...DONT HURT ME for being honest!Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
4,a little higher than 3 1/2 stars,This is a pretty good debut album; who cares whose kid she is? The second half of the album is actually better than the first half. Brooke's voice sounds a little tinny when she's singing higher--she sounds much better when in the lower register. I'm curious to see how she does next time around.
4,Wolfhound owners will appreciate,Good book about the trials and tribulations of a puppy being stolen from breeder. What it went through and the paths crossed in order to get back to a loving master.
4,Sleep like a baby,"This CD has a great selection of Celtic songs, both with lyrics and instrumental. The selections are soft, calming and have the desired effect for babies and children: sleep. You need not be Irish to enjoy this CD."
5,One of the Best,"Enjoyed this DVD and liked the approach of the documentary. It was informative, educational, and the scenery was a plus. It is one that I will enjoy repeatly and a nice addition to my library. Wished I had seen Discovering Italy before making my first trip to Italy this summer."
2,Unimpressive...,"I love Tommy Tenney. His book The Road Home is absolutely amazing and One Night With the King was good also. I was very dissappinted by this book. Other than the letters from Esther, this book was lacking in any creativity or interesting storyline."
2,same stuff,"I used to think DMX was a tight rapper but i have heard all his Cd's and they are all the same. There a rock - rap hardcore beat and he never changes his style always really hardcore. He needs to change a little bit he is getting weaker and always talks about the same things like his ""dawgs"" and everything else. Always the same thing."
2,DMX IS SOFT AS PUFFY,"This is the bottom barrell of hip hop right here! DMX is a prime example of the problem with hip hop in the last couple years. DMX is an awful lyricist, who acts like he is the grimiest rapper out there, when in reality he is the most radio friendly commmercial rapper in the last couple years. All his songs are based around stupid catchy hooks like, ""We right Here"" ""barking dog noises"" and ""where my dogs at????"". Hopefully in a couple years the mainstream will drop DMX and he will really be asking ""Where his dogs went""..."
4,Another great album.,"I actually think this is his second best album. Right behind his first one. If you are a DMX fan or if you've heard a few of his old songs and you liked it, you should try this one out."
2,The Great Depressive,"I was very dissapointed when I bought this album the day it came out. What can I say, 75% of the beats are pretty lame and DMX seems to shout out the names of his previous albums more than he writes orginal lyrics, or should I say creative lyrics. DMX has pretty much lost his hardcore edge that created him off his first and best effort, ""Its Dark and Hell is Hot"". If you are into buying CD's for one or two good songs, by all means, pick this one up. But if you like to sit and chill through a whole CD, this is definitly not for you."
4,The Dog X is back....,"Well, DMX is back, and he's nothing short of a Ruff Ryders legend.Maybe it's not as good as ""And Then There Was X"" but X keeps it tight with joints like: Who We BeShorty Was Da BombDamien IIIWhen I'm NothingThe rest of the album is just as dope, but not overly amazing....Track 1 ""Sometimes"" is DMX at his poetic best.All in all, a worthy place in your DMX album collection."
2,Listening to this gets you into a great depression,"This cd has maybe 2 or three worthwill tracks and that is it. IF you want something good, check out his first cd and third cd."
4,DMX - The Great Depression,"This album is all about X going through the tough times in his life. The making of this album followed his grandmother's death amongst other problems he was facing. There are more slow songs than we are used to seeing from X, yet as always all of his emotions are shown in his songs with his voice. This is not some of X's best work, however it is still better than most other mc's have to offer.top tracks:1-when i'm nothing (f. stephanie mills)2-trina moe3-damien III4-number 115-school street"
3,It's aight but nothin special,"This is a good album its not as good as ""Its Dark and Hell is Hot"" or ""And Then There Was X"" but it does have ""Flesh of My Flesh and Blood of My Blood"" beat. this album has some tight X songs like ""Number 11"" ""Damien 3"" and ""Trina Moe"" I think that the best songs on the album are ""A Minute For Your Son"" and ""When I'm Nothin"" not really like typical X songs but it seems like hes gettin to be mroe relaxed, go cop his book E.A.R.L. but i dont think is a classic DMX album his next album""this aint a game"" is gonna be tigh!"
4,Exceptional angelic encounters enveloping the soul....,"Though I believe the experience of angelic encounters must be one of the most ultimate levels of spiritual gratifications for human beings, I remain skeptical of the acknowledgement of a reincarnate being as specific as the apostle Paul. However the book projects many wonderful events on which one can build a solid base for valid angelic encounters on earth. For the spiritually quested Christian this book offers new horizons for added adventure in the divine connection facing the church in the new millenium. The validation of Nick's experience will result with his active progression in future angelic encounters, a concrete demonstration of his sincerity to his acceptance of a major undertaking benefiting the people of this erra, also accepting the accountability for his part in this divine movement established by angelic intervention. An interesting account of things to come."
5,The Messengers,This is a book that I have owned for many years and I found that all the information written about remains a wonderful research book in understanding why we are all here.
2,The Messengers,"I bought the book as a gift and thought I was getting a hardback and that it was new,. I paid quite a bit for the book and was shocked when it arrived as it was a used paperback that was $6.50 and I was charged $45. + I was very embarrassed to send it and felt ripped off.NO FURTHER COMMENT,"
1,Terrible,I buy Patterson books because of the specific subject matter. I was quite disappointed with this purchase!
4,A very fun read that won't dissapoint.,"How some of the other reviewers say they could abandon the book midway through is beyond me. Sure some of the jokes in the book are old, but hey they were new back then so what would you expect?If you like reading of Mid-evil times or just want a fun read pick up this book and enjoy it for what it is.The only thing I didn't like about the book was the prize drawing insert with the grand prize being a trip to France. Ummm sorry but I think a trip to Iraq sounds better."
1,Very disappointed,"This is the worst book written by James Patterson. The absolute worse and a waste of my time. I forced myself to finish it hoping it would get better. Well, it didn't. I can't believe he actually wrote this. It's not his style of writing at all. Andrew Gross must have written this book and used James Patterson's name to help sell it."
1,Infanticide,"I never thought of myself as squeemish, but after only 100 or so pages I had to put the book down in disgust. How many more babies will be killed in this tale? It's not only the death of infants and young children, but the gruesome, heartwrenching detail in which they are described! Enough!! I definately would not recommend this book for other mothers."
3,loved-hated it,"I couldn't put the book down and read the whold thing virtually in one sitting. I don't advocate or like it when anything bad befalls the innocent, young and babies specifically. However there probably is truth to the infanticide of the times and in fact our own times e.g. Iraq. This was not an escapist book for me and the overt brutality was disturbing because it is probably all too real."
2,Boring and bloody......,"What a disappointment! I found this story highly overrated. It could have been written in a hundred pages. It's simply the same bloody, gorey scene over and over. It's also very predictable. The ""Jester"" is a likable character, but not likable enough to save this dreary story. Patterson needs to stick to his usual genres."
4,Riviting historical novel,"Tale of dark ages life, love, and battles for justice and freedom. Lords and ladies and the villagers who support them. Difficult to put down as the adventure enfolds."
5,Best Book Ive ever Read,"This is truly one of the best books I have ever read. It only took me 4 days to read, I couldnt stop turning the pages. This is a book for people who are into romance, action, and fantasy all packed into one. I recommend this to all."
1,Jester lays an egg,"James Patterson keeps going downhill. Andrew Gross as his co-writer does nothing to help. Roses are Red was the last Patterson novel that was halfway decent. Violets are Blue was horrible, but The Jester is even worse.I love historical fiction, especially if it is well-researched and authentic. This book is neither. The anachronisms and especially the modern slang make this novel a boring and poorly-written piece. It's never explained how these medieval characters determine how the artifacts they bring back from the Crusades are authentic. You are supposed to have faith, I guess.For a well-researched and page-turning medieval action thriller, get Michael Crighton's TIMELINE instead of this dud."
2,"Interesting, but inaccurate","If you can be satisfied with a book that offers only a fast-paced plot, this is the book for you.Despite the action, I did not enjoy this book. The events in the story were too convenient to ring true, from the fate of main character's wife to the family connections of his new love. I have a major complaint with the rescue scene at the end, but won't explain and spoil the ending for you if you intend to read it. If you have read it, ask yourself this--considering Emilie's family connections, would Baldwin really have chosen the action he planned to take? If Anne had wanted to stop him, wouldn't it have been smart to let her family know of his plans???Also, the dialogue makes no attempt whatsoever to be historically accurate. While medival English would be a little difficult to read, the modern diction used by the characters is disingenuous."
4,The Jester,"After the first 2 chapters, you're hooked. A good entertaining read. A most interesting lead character in this book."
4,"A departure, a surprise, and a good read","This book is NOT what James Patterson is known for in terms of the setting, but at the same time has the suspense he is known for. Like other readers I had trouble getting into the first part of the story, where Hugh is going on the Crusades, but once I got through that it was great. The Crusades were a necessary setup I think and having read other historically based fiction, it could have drug on much longer, but thankfully did not. I did not find the ending expected, though I started to guess at some of the ""secrets"", but I couldn't guess all of them. I loved that Emilie was NOT a helpless damsel in distress. It's about time! But then again I think Patterson is known for his strong female characters (Lindsay Boxer, Kate in Kiss the Girls). I think this book is well worth wading through the beginning history and getting to the meat of the story: Hugh's time as the Jester."
3,Not up to the hype or down to the pans,"This book is a big departure for Patterson. Stanch fans of Alex Cross will not care for this book. However, it is far from being a masterpiece. The characters are not well developed and the situations are unreal and contrived. Still it is a very good ""beach book"". Fast paced, entertaining, and not too taxing.If you like this book, you should read the Brother Cadfael series by Ellis Peters. They have a great feel for the period and are, frankly, much better stories. Start with ""A Morbid Taste For Bones"" and follow the series for an absolutely wonderful series of books."
3,Not the norm,"I love James Patterson and all of his books. This one was quite different from anything else hes written. It does hold the interest, but it just wasnt something I personally enjoyed."
2,the Jester,"The Jester isn't your typical James Patterson novel. The first quarter of the book is boring and moves very slow. I typically enjoy reading books that contain history, but this book just doesn't hold my interest and doesn't move fast as most of his novels do. I keep coming back to the book thinking it had to get better and at times it was interesting. However overall I would not recommend this book if you are a fan of the typical fast moving chapters and suspence of James Patterson books that keep you wanting to read until the very end."
2,Same Old Same Old,"Nothing new here. Predictable, journeyman (woman?) performances that bring nothing new to the table. Some of the artists, regrettably, are long past their prime. And, pul-eeze! Monica Mancini is a jazz singer? Since when? Hate to dis a bunch lot of nice people, but for real jazz, look elsewhere."
5,Thank goodness for Dermmatch,"As a woman losing her hair... all I can say is that Dermmatch works wonders! The colors are dark, so be careful in when you order. It helps make the balding look not so bad. It's a coverup, that's all it is, but it can make you feel a lot better about your hair. I wish I had found this sooner.Any questions about my experience with this please feel free to email me @ FSUBIGDOGS@aol.com."
5,Excellent Product!!!,"This is an amazing way to work magic on your hair. It is near effortless and not messy at all. I wish I had known about this much sooner. My preference has always been to dry my hair without using the hairdryer or any styling products. This makes it easy and possible for me. I just apply it according to instruction, comb my hair through and let it dry naturally. It gives me alot of volume that lasts for days. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that it can make your hair very dry and tangled up. However, this is easily managed by rubbing some oil to the ends of your hair."
4,Great Product,"I've been using this product for over 7 years and am pleased with the results. One kit lasts a very long time and can be used dry, or damp as directed. I do notice that it does make my scalp a bit itchy by the end of the day, and seems to come off easier with sweat than the company will let on.Overall a great product that I recommend."
1,Much potential...lacks in delivery.,"A long-lost journal of Edison's surfaces and a Time Portal is built. Our ""hero"" and his friends go back to the South in hopes of changing history ""for the better"". For a modern day Confederate, the author mis-quotes repeatedly and more; ""Succession"" vice ""secession"", A.S. Johnston making a defense of the South by attributing a statement from the Articles of Confederation to the Constitution etc. Navigating the story is difficult due to numerous grammatical errors. An almost semi-decent alternate history read... I applaude the author's imagination. A longer book with more character development would increase this book's readability tremendously."
3,great old-school skate rock,"""Steve Caballero watch out!"" That's what I remember from the first Powell Peralta video... or was it Thrasher Skate Rock Vol 1...? Anyway, that was when I first heard ""Skate and Destroy"" by The Faction. Then my friend got the Dark Room album and I was hooked. Really cool to have this stuff released on CD now. If you like punk rock and garage rock, check out the Faction and JFA, two similar, and great, bands from the 80s height of skateboarding. The songs are antisocial, sometimes funny, not technical or complex, and high-energy. Skate Rat Rock in its prime. My favorite tracks are Tongue Like A Battering Ram, Dark Room, Lets Go Get Cokes, Skate and Destroy, Deathless, and California Dreamin."
5,Best Roller Available,"I've wanted a roller for home after beginning regular pilates workouts over two years ago and am very pleased with the quality of this product, it's price and the convenience of being able to order through Amazon."
5,Difficult to Put Down!,"This is a fascinating work. It deals primarily with two dominant aspects of life in the Zimbabwe region, professionally guided big game hunting and the political/military unrest prevailing in that area for years. Generally the same characters play roles in both theaters. For hunters of various levels of experience, the detailed discussion of firearms, ammunition and its effects, and hunting methods brings back treasured memories. For the student of political science, it is similar to being a participant as regimes surface, compete, rise and fall, peacefully and otherwise. It kept me up past midnight reading it. I really enjoyed this book and recommend it."
3,Less than I expected,It was the usual mythological drama of course but excelled due to some of the best leading men! The graphices and pyrotechnics were awesome! Too much variation in sound though; growls and explosions over the top and dialog sometimes whispered and unintelligible...had to keep the volume moving line a roller-coaster. The Cast was great but the over all product was a let down. I probably would not recommend
3,RELEASE THE BACKGROUND NOISE!,"What can I say? These sequels always have a possible story that suffers to get in the way of the special effects and noise. Yes, the movie had good acting. Yes, the movie had good special effects. And yes, this movie had a top notch cast. Unfortunately, NO, this movie's story did not hold much of an interest as it was overwhelmed by special effects and noise. Although there were many good parts, the movie droned on and on creating a mind numbing effect that surprisingly induced sleep and apathy. For this movie, less means more. It passes as a good ""there's nothing else on"" movie.Take your girlfriend and tell her to bring her knitting, but don't forget your latest edition of Biker Babes to flip through during the show."
3,THE MOVIE WAS A O K,"I dont understand why it had to end like this. The ending was not what i was expecting. Everyone has there own opinion,just watch it for yourself"
1,Wrath of the Titans,"I downloaded in the US to watch after a flight over to Germany. I missed the 48 hour time limit I guess, it didn't work.1 star because it wouldn't play, I hear it's good."
2,Sooooo much worse than the original!,"Not sure why Disney released this movie so quickly after the first one. I really enjoyed the first installment a couple of years ago...great storyline and special effects. This movie, though, is terribly uncohesive and confuses one quite easily with about 87 different subplots. Yes, the special effects still rock, but the plot is as thin as paper. It's terrible! Rent this one only if you love computer graphics and care nothing about storyline. I actually felt a bit sorry for the actors here as they definitely deserved something better."
3,Decent Sequal,"I rented it on Amazon prime and streamed it to my set. Very satisfied with the HD quality streaming, but ensure you have good bandwidth to take advantage of this if streaming. Overall the movie was decent for a sequal (To Clash of the Titans), but really didn't offer anything that was a surprise story-wise. It has great effects and a large-scale plot, but overall lacking for any real character development or real ties to the viewer. I just wasn't invested in the outcome of the battles (you knew good would triumph over evil and it looks to be a really predictable way. So for what its worth it was a decent sequal, and worth the rental. I would not make a buy recommendation based on the content of the movie."
4,Greek Myth Now in Action!,"Lots of action, great myth now alive on screen...great fun for everyone! A must have for your private movie collection!"
1,This sucks!!!,"I thought that it would be more about the titans. Instead, it's some suped up love story, with a few graphics thrown in for good measure. Don't waste your time or money on this one!"
1,Wouldn't work!!!,My son was looking forward to watching this video and much to our dismay after about 20 minutes it stopped running. Very disappointing. Redbox is a lot cheaper and more reliable.
4,Good,"I love the Greek Mythology, The frist movie the ""Clash of The titans"" was very good and this was just as good keeping the tradition of the segall."
3,Not worth the money to buy. Descent rental,"Movie was OK. But I expected a little more action. It had a few good momenents, but didn't hold up to Clash of the Titans."
2,disappointed,This was supposed to be a sequel worth watching but it was sooooooo BORING!! It is because i love Greek Mythology that I gave this movie 2 stars and not one :(
3,wrath of the titans,"Good movie,a few frozen scenes,but ok for used dvd,to much trouble too exchange,don't watch it that much,ok for the kifs"
3,Nice special effects but expected more,"The special effects, while present, were nicely constructed, but I expected to see a bit more from this movie, in terms of lay-out of plots."
4,Liked it,I like the series. I liked being pulled into a show and forget about the world. Watch fantasy a bit and its pretty cool. Story was fun.
3,Definitely different,"It was enjoyable from a purely entertainment viewpoint. The acting was mediocre at best. Would I recommend it, possibly. It had its stupid parts for sure."
4,A Wonderful Entertaining Comedy about Class and True Romance,"When a Novelist (Taye Diggs) joins his former College Friends (Terrence Howard, Nia Long & Harold Perrineau Jr.) to see his Close Friends (Morris Chestnut & Monica Calhoun) first's Wedding but everything goes wrong, when his latest novel is actually based on his friends lives and the Situation goes Worse between their Friendship.Directed by Malcolm D. Lee (Undercover Brother) is the Cousin of Filmmaker:Spike Lee. This is a Multiple and Intrigue Comedy with Romance and Drama. The Performances from the Cast is the True-Light of the film. The Film's Plot Twist makes this very Watchable. This was a Modest Box Office Success in Theaters. This is a Entertaining film. Grade:B+."
5,...DANG!....,"DANG! Terrence Terrence I tell you i loved this movie for so long and this for me is what made Terrence Howard very sexy and talented *smiling* just had to say that first...This was a good movie, great cast of actors and story line. This is the type of movie you would watch with a group of girlfriends or guyfriends very entertaining."
5,Gorgeous presentation!,"Love the tea from this company--delicious and such an elegant presentation. I drink a ton of tea, both hot and iced and so far this company ranks among my top favorites for taste and aesthetics."
5,Amazing,John Austin is an incredible musician. His music is powerful and beautiful. Harder When You Run is one of my alltime favourite albums.
3,weird break,"Sizzlers are really fun to play with so I do love the product. However, one actually sheared in half when they came together on a counter. Maybe there was a flaw in the manufacturing of this particular set; not sure."
5,Power to the People,"Unlike THE CASE AGAINST THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, an anti-globalization compilation put out by many of the same people who contributed to ALTERNATIVES TO ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION, this book is more slim and concisely articulated. If you are in any way interested in the debates surrounding democracy, ecology, sustainability, resource management, globalization, locatization, the environment, corportism, bio- and cultural-diversity, human rights, food security, job security, energy, transportion, manufacturing and the general measure of progress, this book is a must. I was particularly impressed with the way ALTERNATIVES was able to blend an argument for global regulations while at the same time stridently championing the rights of local, autonomous indigenous peoples. This is THE document for anyone interested in understanding globalization and its possible alternatives."
5,Wind in the Willows 2nd Series,First class. My kids have watched this over and over again. They love it. Highly recommended !!
5,help i can't stop laughing,One of the funniest books I have ever read. I would highly recommend it . I liked it so much I ordered one for 2 of my friends
4,Good~!,"In korea, Noah's Ark is very popular with mom. Because they can tell the Bible's story to kids during a play.So I will tell the story about Noah, when my son grown up."
2,Not much of a shape sorter,"This is a very solidly made toy, but as for being a shape sorter...it's a joke. You can drop the pieces through virtually any hole and once it's unpackaged it has so many animal shaped cut-outs that it basically resembles a puzzle with numerous missing pieces. The only use my 2-year old has for this toy is dumping out the animal pieces and spreading them all over the house. I regret the purchase."
2,Sadly disappointed.,"I purchased this for my 2 year old twins that love their little plastic shape sorter. I was quickly drawn to it because it was Noah's Ark themed and looked like it would be tons of fun for the kids. I am also a big fan of Melissa & Doug products.They excitedly opened the box and took all the animals out. The proceeded to pickup each animal piece and drop them one by one through the *same* hole. You see, this is not like the shape sorters from years ago where each piece will only fit into one hole...when turned to the side the pieces will fit in any hole. It wasn't a challenge and they weren't interested in playing with it."
2,Optical Lens Cleaner did not work,I had bought this as a substitute for having the PSP repaired; it had no impact. Also did not hear the motor humming inside the PSP as advertised. I had to have the PSP sent out for repairs.
3,movie,Was not one that I would watch again. The grandkids liked it and it was a very inexpensive movie to watch.
3,Scary Movie 4,"This movie is pretty funny but not as funny as its predecessors. It's worth a watch though. Once again, Leslie Nielsen steals the show with his (unfortunately) small but hilarious role."
4,Number 4 is here,"I've been waiting for this 4th installment of the Scary Movie series for a long time now, and it is hilarious. The Brokeback Mountain scene is priceless, nobody can deny that. The overall plot kind of lagged, but I was too busy laughing to notice. I say, if you even remotely liked any of the other 3 'Scary Movies' then you'd like this movie."
3,Four Times the Charm in High Definition!!!,This was my least favorite of the series. But it looks good in High Definition and is worth it because you get the unrated version. It seems liked The writers were trying too hard to make you laugh. There are some funny moments in this movie and it is not a total waste of time but some of the jokes were stale and the third one was a lot funnier and more cutting edge with the laughs. It was a fun ride but with some drawbacks.
4,Very Funny!!!,"The Scary Movie series has gotten very childish, but it's still funny. It spoofs films such as Saw, The Village, The Grudge, Brokeback Mountain, and War of the Worlds. After Tom Logan commits suicide, Cindy Campbell gets a job helping an elderly woman. She slowly begins falling for her new neighbor, Tom Ryan. When aliens that look like the puppet from Saw begin attacking earth, Cindy and Tom split and hope to find each other again. On her journey, Cindy runs into her best friend, Brenda. Together, they try to figure out what Toshio from The Grudge has to do with the aliens, and why they're attacking. I highly recommend SCARY MOVIE 4!!!"
3,Eh.,"*Scary Movie 4* was so-so. This movie makes parodies of Saw, The Village, War of the Worlds and The Grudge. Other people, such as the POTUS and his delayed reaction to the 9/11 (replaced with the alien invasion) and Michael Jackson were also included. Basically, this movie was weak. You're likely to get chuckles instead of laughs.The best part for me, with a good laugh, was the Oprah part, which was at the very end of the movie.Like I said, it's a so-so movie."
2,Pretty scary...NOT!,"Well, I need to say. I have not seen even one of the movies this movie spoofs. Not one. I pretty much stopped seeing all the ""flavor of the month"" scary movies. I'm just really sick of them. Kind of funny they also spoofed ""Brokeback Mountain"" as that was not a scary movie, right?Any who, I rented this, because I thought it got two thumbs up, but that was my mistake.I won't write a novel on this one, as I don't think its worth my time. Suffice it to say, it was short enough that I didn't get too bored. I thought the ""cameo"" scenes were fairly entertaining. I loved the goofiness of it. But something is missing from the originals. Something, maybe the ""campy"" humor? Not sure.I did enjoy the scene where all the country's nationals were running around without clothes. Nothing like seeing a banging Indian girl running around without clothes. Bangin'!MC White said: Not very funny."
2,Scary Movie 4 (Unrated Full Screen Edition),"Scary Movie 4 (Unrated Full Screen Edition)~ Faris is one dissapointing movie indeed. I was like totally looking forward to seeing this flick and then afterwards I had the feeling that I had been cheated. Scary Movie 1, 2 and 3 are amazing movies (especially part 2) and are filled with classic scenes. This one does not meet this high criteria at all. To include movies like war of the worlds is also inane since War of the Worlds is not a horror movie at all. The inclusion of spoofs on The Grudge is brilliant and overall I have to give this movie 2 stars since it unfortunately does not deliver the goods like the previous 3."
4,"ALMOST ""LUTE LIKE""","David Russell has been part of my guitar listening experience for sometime now. He truly is a phenomenal guitarist. On this album he plays many of what I call ""Renaissance Hits"" on, of course, the ""acoustic"" guitar. I had to listen very close to determine that he really was playing these Renaissance works on the guitar and not on the lute itself. He does a fantastic job of replicating the sound of the lute and what I consider the ""Renaissance Style "", The album contains a good sample of Renaissance music with y works by John Dowland, Pietro Borrono, William Byrd and of course by that ubiquitous ""Anonymous."" I feel that this album could really be valuable as an introduction to the beauties of ""Renaissance Music"". Anyway, David Russell plays the works contained therein splendidly with very beautiful tone"
3,"Perry Mason pulls a ""Doctor Watson""","This is the 29th Perry Mason novel I've read (the 12th in the series). Forgive me for giving this one less than a rave review. Usually Perry Mason sees what no one else can see--a sort of mid-20th Century Sherlock Holmes. In this case the only surprise about the solution is that it takes Mr. Mason so long to happen upon it. The most interesting feature of this story is Perry Mason's marriage proposal to Della Street. (Holmes' own Doctor Watson got married in the ""Sign of Four,"" but his wife was killed off in ""The Empty House."" I guess his wife ""got in the way"" one too many times. Could Della suffer a similar fate?)"
4,Good medieval action.,"A dragon talking (and looking at times) like Sean Connery in Entrapment seems a bit ludicrous, but it works. Dennis Quaid as the wandering knight does a good job, but the dragon steals the show. The camerawork is spectacular, especially in widescreen and Dragonheart has a good score. The one thing that was lacking was the relationship between many of the characters. I don't say it often, but this movie could have been a bit longer to work the personalities out. Even so, it is a great show, with plenty of action."
3,"FX 4, plot 2","Despite some excellent elements, the rather contrived plot of ""Dragonheart"" fails to live up to the talent and the special effects.We all know the characters -- the wise, old dragon (voiced by Sean Connery), the heroic knight (Dennis Quaid), the damsel, the evil prince . . .there are no real surprises here.If you are a fan of Quaid or Connery, or you like sword-and-sorcery, this film will provide you with a pleasant diversion, but if you are on a budget you might want to keep going down the list. END"
2,Half a film,"It simply isn't enough just to have good special effects when making a movie. This one certainly does, but the plot is lame and not well developed at all."
5,Dragonheart,This epic dvd movie takes you back in time when king arthur and camelot was pure drama and fantasy at its best and the kind of movie you can enjoy time after time. It makes you feel like you want to be there where it all started.
1,Dont rent from Amazon,"I rented this, and once downloaded it stated that my client license was up. Tech support couldnt help me, and instead just refunded my money. It was nothing but a waste of time."
2,Decent but Loud,Pushes air decently and works well horizontally. However the amount of noise it creates (even when my system is idling) is way above that of the other 5 fans in my case.
4,Best Customer Service,Although not what I needed for the F61 error on my Panasonic Home Audio Theater. The customer Service is the BEST....
1,A Sham and a Fake,"I tried this therapy....after several months of chelation, I had to have a stent...followed by another stent within 2 months, followed by a heart attack and a heart bypass...Have been fine for eight years since the bypass and no chelation....Need I say more? Stick with a REAL Doctor, do yourself a favor. Do your research and you'll find that both authors used to write every week for ""The National Enquirer"". Oh, one of the authors just died...from congestive Heart failure. Save your money."
2,Bright but short-lived,"I bought these several months ago. I was using Silverstar and Phillips Xtreme bulbs that adjust the capsule size and gas mix for more light output per watt, at the cost of high temperatures and short bulb life. I thought going with these Hella bulbs rated for a high wattage might give me equivalent or better light output but longer life.Well, much to my disappointment, while these bulbs were bright -- even brighter than the Xtreme's -- they did not necessarily perform any better. After only 2 months in use one of the bulbs burned out. Fortunately I bought two pairs so I'll replace the one hoping it was just a random manufacturing defect, but I am not encouraged."
5,HOT hot hot,"Great, been using for over a year now and have been great, bright hot clean light, cuts threw most fog but the thickest, more than enough to blind oncoming drivers, got with the rampage 7' conversion kit for my 96 miata"
3,Good for the Time,"This album highlights what was going on at that time, Make me Laugh was TV Evanglists getting caught pants down, Who Cares Wins explored the homeless problom, and Be All End All, was about suicide.Granted it's not as heavy as ATL but it's good never the less."
5,The taste of Italy,"Heavenly to be able to order beautifully cut, authentic prosciutto in small, economical amounts. Used right, a 3 oz. package goes a long way -- we had it with melon, stuffed in chicken, and shredded in a creamy pasta sauce. A really great deal at this price when used sparsely to enhance dishes. Not enough here for more than one good sandwich, but added to sandwiches, egg dishes, sauces, chicken or veal dishes, etc. etc. etc., it gives plain dishes a gourmet flair."
4,GRAINGER GROOVE,I ENJOYED THE WHOLE CD. I ESPECIALLY LIKE MANTIS AND PHASE I. BOTH TUNES I USE AS PICK ME UPS. THE STING TUNE FRAGILE HAS A GOOD FEEL AND IS A COMPLIMENT TO HIS MUSIC...AS SUNG BY GARY G.
1,Show your moral outrage at this movie,"Contrary to the lovely scenery, moving storyline or ""family"" values espoused by the makers of this film, potential buyers may be disturbed to find that two horses were in fact killed in the making of this movie, and witnesses to the events were offered bribes to cover it up. If you truly love horses and remember the original [book] story of Flicka, you will boycott this film as Fox Films do not deserve to profit off the cruel death of two of these gorgeous animals. For more information, visit [...]"
4,Better than the original,"In my opinion this version is better than the original starring Roddy McDowell. It's along the same story line but with a more modern approach. For you (us) country music fans, Tim mcGraw stars in it, and does an excelant job. As a plus, the scenery is great!!"
3,HORSE STORY,"With sumptuous Wyoming scenery and beautiful horses, FLICKA is a retread of the popular book, movie and tv series. The movie sets no new ground in the story of a young free spirited girl who battles her stern father to tame a wild mustang that saved her from a mountain lion.Pert Alison Lohman (MATCHSTICK MEN) plays the heroine, who is determined to go against her father's wishes and tame and ride the mustang Flicka. Country superstar Tim McGraw (FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS) makes an okay dad, but he doesn't possess a wide emotional range. Maria Bello is very good as usual in her role as the supportive wife and mother.While entertaining in its genre, the movie doesn't really have a lot of dramatic impetus but the family will probably enjoy it."
5,Flicka Fantastic Film,"Flicka was a sensational film. It was refreshing to see a film that showed family values without being preachy. The music was uplifting. The lack of profanity was appreciated. After I saw it at the theater I had to order it for my home library. Tim McGraw was super sexy as the dad and like most dads, in the end came to understand and listen to his daughter. Of course he should have listened to his wife sooner."
2,Original so much better,The original Flicka is so much better this one doesn't even compare. The parents in this movie are too young for the kids or the kids are too old for the parents. In the original movie the boy was a 12 year child not an out of control teenage girl. Very Hollywood.
1,How you feel about this movie will depend on how you want to raise your daughters.,"I borrowed this movie from the library first, to see if it was worth buying. Unlike the first Flicka, this movie is less about a horse and more about taming a girl, transforming her from an independent and skillful young woman into a subservient and obedient child. The Dad even talks about disciplining her being like taming a horse to ride, breaking its spirit. If this is the message you want to send to your daughters, fine. You will like the movie. If not, I suggest you pass on this. There are other girl-horse movies out there that do not do this."
2,Save your money!,"I was so disappointed in this movie, being a great fan of Mary O'Hara's original book. Tim MCGraw was better than I expected---everything else was worse!"
2,disappointed :(,"I was greatly surprised by this movie, it was not as good as I was hoping it'd be. It was slow, and for me, a little gory. The acting was good, but that's about it."
3,Where is Faith Hill?,"I could not get past the fact that Tim McGraw is with another woman in this movie nor could I accept him being such a tough Dad. It just isn't his personality. I just want him to sing but I guess he did OK. Tim McGraw is such an entertainer on a music stage that I just couldn't take this. Maybe I am not being fair; however, Tim stick with the music."
1,Sadly....,"Being a horse and animal lover, I was greatly awaiting this release. Having since found out that at 2 of the horses were killed and Fox has tried bribery to cover this up, I can assure you I won't purchase this nor be seeing this in the theatre. If one of the actors hand so much as scrape we'd here it all over the news. Animals can't speak for themselves, we have to."
1,Junk,"ca42 cable for a Nokia cell phone didn't work, tryied another ca42 cable that I borrwed from my son-in-law and it worked. Iwould have sent it back, but it would cost morre to send it back than I paid for it."
1,Nokia CA--42 Compatible USB Data Cable,"I received my product in a timely manner. According to the Nokia website this cable is the one designed for my cellphone. However,I am not able to down load my pictures taken by my Nokia cellphone onto my computer using thie cable I ordered. I don't know why, the message I get from my computer is that the cellphone is not connected, when in fact it is connected.SincerelyTerry Elbin"
2,Didn't work as expected,"I must say this cable didn't work as I expected because I tried installing their provided CD drive and it failed to connect. Tried Nokia Suite for my phone model, the cable didn't connect and failed to work. However, everything failed. I don't suggest buying this cable as I already spent ~$10 w/shipping for this cable.I tried using other methods from the reviewers and no, it didn't work. FFS, I am so mad now."
1,CA42 Compatible Cable,This cable was not supported by the Nokia phone as advertised. Nokia tech said it was made inthe wrong country to have the proper electronic characteristics. Amazon made good on the whole purchase.
1,Buyer Beware,"Do some research before buying a product like this. It's a Nokia nock-off and the driver didn't do it for me or my phone. If you don't want to waste time figuring it out, buy a legitimate cable from Nokia."
1,Over-rated,"Miley Cyrus is as over-rated as Camp Rock.The girl has no talent and can't sing [let alone live] give me Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato or the Jonas Brothers anyday.The Jonas Brothers are the only reason this DVD wasn't binned. Instead I gave it away. Yes, gave. Not sold. Gave.I can't understand what all the hype about Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus is about.I guess if you're eight it's understandable. But paying $1000 for a ticket to something that came out in cinemas, on DVD and on Disney Channel really is crazy.$1000 for something good maybe, but for this?It's a crime."
2,not what it was in the theater,"this was cool in the theater, becuase it was realistic and looked nice, in this version the only 2 colors you can see are shades of blue and red and it makes it like a whole different video, it was a movie I remembered as the best 3D movie I had ever seen, and on this version, it is just like anything else, its not worth the money to get this DVD, just wait til someone uploads it on thepiratebay or demonoid and get it free."
2,No closed captioned,"I bought it for my young daughter and we sat down to watch it only to learn that the whole time Miley was singing on stage, it was not closed captioned so I had no idea what she was singing about. The only time it was closed captioned was when she was rehearsing for the show or talking between songs. This isn't right and I expected the entire songs to be closed captioned. Also wearing the 3-D glasses really started to hurt my eyes as they were of poor quality so I had to take it off. I am not pleased with the whole thing."
1,"I'm not satisfied,it is inconformity.","its title name include ""3-D movie"",but received disk is 2D-version!I have seen fact after the package be opened,I don't like to return.but I'm not satisfied this item"
3,Explanation of why it uses old-style 3D red-blue glasses,"In answer to those who are questioning why they didn't use the same technology they used in the theaters for the 3D effect... you can't reproduce it on TV.The latest 3D effects requires two separate lights (wavelengths) to be emitted toward you. The black 3D glasses used in theaters are actually polarizing filters that allow only one of the images(wavelenths) to enter each individual eye.Televisions only emit one wavelenth light, and thus, cannot be separated with the use of polarizing filters (black 3D glasses). Currently, the only way to achieve any kind of 3D effect on TV is using the old-school red-blue (anaglyph) glasses to filter out the respective red-blue images of Miley."
3,Too much what...not enough how,"I was disappointed in this book to be honest. I was hoping for more actionable info that could help me turn my career around. This did not give it to me. I expected this to be a ""how-to"" book but it was fairly light on the how. :(Maybe it is because I already do many of the things he talked about. I wanted something new and fresh. This is an adequate work but not spectacular."
5,Must have for any employer!,"Buy them buy the dozens and give them to all your employees on day one. Assign them a chapter a week for the first 18 weeks and let them tell yo what they learned. If they get through the 18 weeks you have a ""keeper"", If not they will be replaced in a matter of time."
3,"Good product, bad packaging.","The hose its blue! How cool is that? haha Beside its bright visual appearance, it seem pretty durable and is very flexible. In the picture, you see the hose and a coupler attach to it. What you don't see is that the genius manufacturer who package the item stuffed another rubber coupler inside the hose. Like someone said in another review, that coupler will be VERY hard (very hard, but not impossible) to put onto the hose because since it been stuffed inside it, it will be ""deformed"" when you take it outside. It will be in in this weird oblong/ovalish shape and will be super hard to get to back to its circular shape like so that it can be place onto the hose's end. In addition, it doesn't come with any clamps. Oh and another thing, nothing major, but the brand ""Spectre"" doesn't appear on the hose or the coupler like some of their other items."
3,Not for those with conservative values,"I bought this film because I am a fan of Shah Rukh Khan, and I knew he had a cameo in this film. I have conservative values, so I was really uncomfortable with the loose values displayed by the main characters at the beginning of the film. I also am used to viewing conservative Hindi films, and this was not one of them. I really like Akshay Kumar. And it was fun to see him in this film. I thought the baby was absolutely adorable! She had the most beautiful eyes!!! This film has a similar storyline to ""Three Men and a Baby"". Shah Rukh Khan shows up during a song at a wedding near the end of the film. When he appeared...to me...it was like the clouds parted and the sun came out. But, that's because I'm a big fan of his."
3,Still searching,I read the book before and after I got married. It gave basically one answer to a woman's ability to enjoy sex. It didn't work and now I'm searching for a different answer.
5,Dramatic Changes Posssible,Sent this to my daughter as my sisters insist it inspired and dramatically improved their love life.
1,didn't like it; please don't read it,"I read this and while I appreciate the ""knowledge"" about the act, the LaHayes are way off. They are not fair in assessments about Natural Family Planning. If I remember correctly, they also are pro-abortion in cases where the baby is severely deformed. Go figure!For information about Natural Family Planning (NOT the rhythm method), visit: ccli.orgor popepaulvi.com"
3,Promising start but loses steam midway,"The blurb at the back of Helen Dunmore's Orange Prize winning novel, ""A Spell of Winter"" suggested a haunting gothic-styled thriller built around forbidden passions and family secrets. For a good two-thirds of the novel, Dunmore kept up the suspense with a litter of teases and dark hints which unfortunately remained unresolved and a mystery even at the end. You could have forgiven her deliberate sense of obscurity and vagueness had she gone for a less open ended denouement, but the last third of the novel was a major let down for me. I felt almost cheated after a such a promising start. Sure, Dunmore writes exquisitely. Her prose is smooth and fluent and a joy to read. Pity she let the suspense and momentum peter out midway. In my humble opinion, not up to the standards I was expecting from a prize winner. But Dunmore is an excellent writer. Perhaps the next book I read of hers will be more fulfulling."
5,Excellent reference for culinary students,I am a culinary student and this was one of the books used in my culinary hot foods class. It was very helpful because the pictures were clear and the recipes were easy to comprehend and precise. For my baking class I used the following study guides which are on amazon:Study Guide for Baking: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations by Melissa HeilmanStudy Guide for Advanced Baking: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations by Melissa HeilmanThese two study guides were quite on target with the kind of questions asked on my baking exams in my culinary school. These 3 books get my highest recommendations.
3,A little disappointing....,"I have a chewer and at first the basic everlasting chew treats lasted a week or two for him. But the Dalmatian is clever, he now knows how to pry the disk out of the toy...drats! So I tried this version thinking it was different and it screwed together; but it didn't slow him down. The whole thing was chewed up in about 1/2 an hour. If your dog is not a voracious chewer---this will probably be good for him/her. My dog DOES love them!"
5,great book,I absolutely agree with Michelle Lee (one of the reviewers above) that it is essential to SEE what is happening when you study Embryology. This book does a great job in that sense and I highly recommend it.
3,Too many terms!,"Keith Moore and Vid Persaud have tried to put together a simplified edition of their seminal book, The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology. Unfortunately, this embryology text misses the mark. There are too many terms and concepts for a non-medical student to learn. This book should be pruned down and be concentrated on a fewer number of concepts. Also, embryological concepts are extremely difficult to learn and a CD-ROM showing animations of the various aspects of the developing embryo would be much more useful. The authors have done extremely well with the illustrations and clinically related pictures. In conclusion, if you must use this text, put together a list of terms from the book and then try to learn the many concepts elucidated."
3,Primary benefit is the music/tabs included,"This book is a small collection of slack key tunes transcribed by the author, and that's its real value. It's not much on instructions or technique. I liked the inclusion of std notation and tabs together; for those who read music it provides a little more foundation. Only those techniques needed for the tunes in the book get minimal explanation. This book is for those fairly proficient on guitar; it wouldn't very effective for use by guitar novices. The CD has audio of each song in the book played at normal speed, plus a brief portion played slowly for clarity. The few exercises on the CD are lumped together several to a track, making them tedious to replay for repetitions."
5,Really Works!!!,"My sister bought this for our ""sister cruise"". Seven days of bliss!! This little pack was great!! We snorkeled in all four ports we were in and everything stayed dry! The first day, we were a little nervous so we had our things inside a zip lock bag and so was not necessary!! We were asked by many where we found these and my sister would smile and say...Amazon...of course!! Thanks for a great product."
3,Not sure what this is actually for!,"I bought this to use while snorkeling - to put my electronic car key, money, credit cards, maybe a cell phone inside rather than leave them on the beach. However, I was quite surprised to read on the packaging that the product is not - apparently - designed for use under the water! So waterproof but... not submersible? I put some toilet paper in the pouch and sealed it and then placed the whole thing in a bowl of water. Soggy toilet paper. OK, forget about putting my electronic car key, cell phone etc. in this pouch. In fact, despite the many positive reviews, I have decided to return it!3 stars is seems to work for lots of people [5], but, the manufacturer does not recommend using it under water, so I won't [0]."
2,"Bag is ok, the carabiner is useless","Bag seals correctly, no problem. Even in surf. The carabiner is quite useless though. Get a better one or a screw close type ring connector instead."
2,so so,does not work that great. the belt slides and moves around. but it did keep water out of my pouch
2,Kwik Tek Dry pack,The clip did not work at all. It was one of those cheap stuff. The nylon pack keeps on falling off my waist. This is just a waste of money.
5,waterproof; great buy,"We got this to take with us when we went snorkeling. It was very durable and didn't leak. When I first ordered it I didn't realize it would be so big. it was a little too bulky for our keys and a few bucks. So, if you are not going to put your passport or other documents in this pack I would recommend to look for a smaller version."
1,Leaked then lost,"This thing leaked like a sieve the first time we used it, forcing us to have to keep our belongings in a zip lock inside the bag, defeating the purpose. Then on the third use it came loose from the clip in the water and it was lost. Thank goodness a kind individual turned it in to the lifeguard! I have bought a couple of the larger Kwik Tek Dry Packs in the past and didn't have the same problem with leakage and loss, but it will be difficult to trust their products again."
4,Worked Well,"Happy with Kwik Tek Dry Pack product. Worked well while snorkeling on recent Caribbean Cruise. Items stayed dry. No matter what waterproof pouch I use, I always put items in a ziplock first, just for added security. Held documents, money and camera easily."
2,"Kwik Tek Dry Pack, Nylon Belt",I got this for my boat thinking it would be good to put my cell phone while out on the water. I would save your money and just ust a zip lock bag. I never tested it under water so not sure if it would leak but works fine if your just looking to keep water from splashing on something.
3,Not the Best Bernie,"I may just need a break from this series, but it seems to me this is the weakest Bernie title so far.The action is moderately different but so formulaicly similar that I am getting afraid that once you have read one Bernie story, you may have read them all. Kind of a shame, cuz I was so fond of the Keller books, and for that matter the first few Bernie titles were pretty good.I am just wondering - looking forward to the next Bernie books - how many times Block has dipped into the well of the - Guilty / Innocent burlgar who would never hurt anyone, and everyone knows it, but JUST THIS ONCE - everyone figures he went off and killed someone / several someones in the course of his job burgling folks fine trinkets and baubles and whatnot.IN fairness this was written 30 years ago in a bit of a lull for mysteries when the format was in a serious downswing, I just hope the next ones are better."
4,"Powerful, great cut, but loud","A very powerful clipper that will cut my thick hair in one quick stroke. To my pleasant surprise it also came with blades and other accessories even though that wasn't included in the product description.The tapering lever has a wide range, probably a quarter inch.My only complaint is that they are extremely loud. When I adjust the power down to reduce the volume it's not strong enough to cut. I have to wear earplugs when I use them and the noise annoys my wife, but other than that it is an awesome product. I am fairly confident that this problem can be resolved through tinkering with the screws.Include blades, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, left taper, right taper. Also came with oil, brush, and blade guard."
4,great,Its a lot nicer than those cheep $20 dollar clippers you get from retail stores. A quality made product
5,Extremely Satisfied,"It's amazing the items that Amazon has access to, and the smooth and easy way that these items can be obtained. The package was new, and the arrival time was as promised. So far, Amazon and their participants have been top notch!"
2,"A ""read once only"" book","This is the second in the Inspector Felse series. Unfortunately Ellis Peters has written pages that are full of descriptions of emotional trauma and ""angst"" of the protagonists as well as waxing lyrical with metaphysical insights. There is no doubt that characters need to be 3-dimensional, as well as scenes and situations to have reality and flavour, but Ellis Peters seems to have over-done it. Readers can skim through some of the more esoteric paragraphs without losing the thread. Despite this, the book does have suspense, a good plot and enough action to hook in the reader and, of course, a surprise ending. Having read it, I don't really want to read it again."
2,Pretty Poor Collection Of Albums,"Unfortunately the only worthwhile album off of Eddie Kendricks late 70's Motown catalog is ""Boogie Down!"" which is not worth paying $50 for. Although there are some decent songs from other albums basically the disco sound had taken all the soul and the songs pretty much sound like the standard cliches one would expect from the majority of disco. Pretty Awful.Standout songs are Boogie Down, The Thin Man, Tell Her Love Has Felt The Need, Trust Your Hear, and Intimate Friends.On The flip side Volume One, ""Keep On Truckin"", is quite good and has a lot of great songs on it!"
1,over the top,"i thought this was going to be a nice dainty necklace that i would be able to wear with many different outfits. however, when i received it, it was much ""clunkier"" than i had expected. it feels like it weighs a ton on y neck. it's very over the top and flashy and the metal is very cheap and has broken."
2,who are these people,"who are these people that write reviews. I am only thirteen and i can at least spell my words right. Another thing is that i wonder if any of these people actually play pool. If you look at their other reviews they seem to all be on political books or things that have nothing to do with pool. It is senseless to even write them then. They could be leading people toward something educational or something not educational. Then their comments, some people need to do their homework before they write all these dumb things. I am conviced that i know more about pool than fifty percent of the reviewers."
4,Fresh and insightful look at personal calling,"""Am I really being called or is it wishful thinking?"" ""If I am responding to the call, why do I still have times of doubt?"" These are among the questions one normally asks when dealing with a call. John P. Schuster masterfully with these and other questions in ""Answering Your Call"".The author makes a strong argument that we often don't feel fulfilled in life if we don't know our purpose. The reason we feel we have no purpose is because we continue to miss our callings when they occur. With this as his thesis he works through the process of knowing what a call is, recognizing when you are called to do something, and responding to your call. This is a fresh and insightful look at defining purpose in your life and a recommended read."
1,Disappointed in what could be a great product,"My husband and I bought the waterproof case for our honeymoon and it worked great at the time. Two months later we went to the beach and the latch cracked when we closed the case. After calling numerous Canon numbers, we discovered that the plastic latch that holds the case closed (and any part of the case for that matter) is un-repairable and the camera case completely unusable. We are very disappointed we spent the money to use the camera case on two occasions."
5,love this novel,this is a story about a man who can be looked up to as a hero... years ago I gave it to my son to read to inspire him to be a hero (my son is now an American Hero in the US Army)
3,LIttle Heathens quite charming,"I read this for a book club, and found some of it quite charming. I particularly liked the home remedies for cleaning and medicine. The author's memories do carry the reader to a different place and time...but is not riveting reading. It is the kind of book you can pick up and read any chapter on its own -- an enjoyable escape if one is in the mood."
5,Unbelievable talent,"I don't even know how or where to start praising the book. To write with such candor and innocence 70 or so years later and retain so many details it is truly remarkable. I have no recollection of ever reading a more delightful book. I am a town boy but old enough to remember the care free childhood, with making your own toys, doing your chores (chopping wood for fire) without questions, being outdoors practically all day without contemporary social fears... the list of memories the author revokes is endless. The style of writing is flawless and unpretentious. The only clue that the book was not ""narrated"" by a very smart 8 years old is the perfect spelling grammar and composition. I ordered few of the books to send to friends.It is not so much a window on the ""good old days"" as it is on human spirit and character. Thank youMrs. Armstrong Kalish"
2,We've been taken,"Cute book but either the author isnt clearly rememberimg her facts or she made them up. in the introduction she states her ancestors moved to IA in 1846 and hunted pheasant on their farm, one problem, pheasant weren't intoduced to the US until 1881 and that was in Oregon. Secondly, in the telling of the preparation of Thanksgiving dinner in 1930 she has some issues. They sent someone out to the garden to pick sage? In IA? Average high temperature in Cedar Rapids at Thanksgiving is in the lo 20s, sage was long killed by then. And hardy souls those boys in the picture, waiting to be called for supper, must be what with sitting outside with short sleeved shirts on and it being 20 degrees out. That's as far as i could stand to read, I'm sure there are plenty more errors beyond this point. Cute, but should be told that it's a novel and not non-fiction."
2,Grandma's diary,"Unless you want to read someone else's grandma's diary, pass on this one. It's entertaining if you are interested in the midwest during the depression (from one person's perspective) but I just couldn't finish it."
4,Memories,I ordered this book for my mother-in-law as she was raised on a farm in Wisconsin. She thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and it brought back many memories of her life on the farm. She indicated that people nowadays do not appreciate life or hard work as they did growing up on a farm.
3,ok buy,"It's a ok product for the not so expensive price. It doesn't heat too well, but if you keep your feet in there for a while, it's ok warm."
3,very helpful for class,"the only think missing would be more info on how structure relates to performance, having a hard time finding a good book with lots of that info."
5,intimate and insightful,"Great book... If you are a social statistician looking for lists of boring statistics, look elsewhere. But if you are interested in an objective, yet intimate, portrait of real people's lives in cultural pockets not easily accessible to many of us, read this book! This book is neither orientalist nor apologetic and its articles contain a depth and insight not often in academic texts. Appropriate for scholars and laypersons alike!"
1,Bad Sewing,"When I first got this, I put my Game Boy in it and was carrying it to my friend's house when the seams broke and my Game Boy fell to the ground and shattered. Carrying your Game Boy in your hand is a much better idea."
2,A very Irish record,"Given that this record purports to come from the Green Island, one should not be wholly surprised that nine of the tracks are not penny whistle at all, but Uileann pipes, nor that the CD I received had ""Andean Flute"" printed on it instead of ""Ireland's Tin Whistle"".All in all, the quality of the music is very uneven, and the whole thing a bit disappointing."
4,Excellent gospel jazz album,"With known gospel saxophonist like Angella Christie, Donald Hayes, Salathiel, and Kirk Whalum putting out outstanding albums, it's difficult to make a name for yourself with a slew of already great artist.Rob Maletick's ""Hand in Hand"" deserves to be placed up there along with some of the best gospel jazz albums. Guest appearances on the album include Kirk Whalum, Kevin Whalum, and Marcus Johnson. The first half of the album are studio tracks. The last portion (tracks 9 - 13) are live tracks. Highlights are ""Lift Up You Hands"", ""Hand in Hand"", and ""Walking the Path"".The album is truly one to be enjoyed at home to relax, in the office, or on the road. This is an excellent gospel jazz album that no one will be disappointed in purchasing."
3,not bad but needs work,I just got the starscream figure and I am dissapointed with it. first there is too much stuff showing when he is in his F-22 aircraft mode. its to bulkyto look real in aircraft mode. the guns are OK ecxept the guns look really bad in aircraft mode. one of the legs allready easily pops of making him hard to transform. the head can be easily seen in aircraft mode. and theres no jet turbine engines on him in aircraft mode. overall it needs work on the jet mode looking more real and less bulky.
2,Jonathan's Starscream,"The color should have been more accurate. In the movie he's a grey f22, not brown. There's a little flap that hides his face. That flap should have been a little bigger, because in airplane mode you can still see his head. I end up having to turn his head a full 180 to hide it. The cannons work poorly. In the movie, only one of Stascream's hands turn into a missle launcher. For that reason Hasbro should have giving him regular robot arms, which also woud have been easier to conceal in airplane mode and made a missle launcher to attach to his arm. Like they did for '08 camero bumble bee. The legs are done great, they should have used that same accuracy to make the arms. For all the transformers the little wholes that the parts snap into should have been a little deeper, because the pieces snap off too easily.Transformers Movie Voyager Starscream"
2,A piece of crap porn movies,Does not show a lot of action. Is not visual in how to have sex. Does not explain visually. All it pretty much shows is people talking. This DVD sucks.
4,Great Read,"This was a very interesting read, as it focuses on one of the lesser known Mexican muralists. As he writes about his life, Orozco gives a glimpse of his art and a comment of the times such as the Mexican revolution and coming to Dartmouth College to paint one of his murals. His own commentary on his art is helpful to further give meaning to the symbols and images he used.However he gives very little information on his own personal life. There seems to be more of a focus on his own personal ideas and beliefs, and only a brief mention of having a wife but never mentions how he met her. Can only see this lack of personal information to Orozco being a very private person."
2,long lists and more lists,"The whole style of this book is very dry and not usersfriendly. The book consists of long lists of objectives and therapeutic interventions each 1 or 2 lines. Sometimes more then 40. It tells you all the time WHAT to do ( exc. [*] emotional impact or educate the patient on effects of stress on symptons)but NEVER HOW .This information is not very helpfull. Everybody knows for example that walking 20 minutes a day is healthy but HOW do you get somebody to do it.That should be the focus of behavioral medicine ( it s about getting to healthy behavior, no ?)This important part: HOW to get to behavior change is not present in this book."
2,Unapproachable,"Despite an obvious self-consciousness of writing for posterity as a U.S. President and the concomitant need to maintain a certain aloof dignity, U.S. Grant provides candid and illuminating interpretations of the causes of both the Mexican War and the Civil War and the imperatives of slavery, never cavilling in his opinion. He is also careful yet enlightening in his opinions of historical figures of his age. But 90% of his memoirs describe battle movements that are unapproachable to anyone without an intimate knowledge of the field. The average reader thus is left without any way of knowing whether movements were brilliantly inspired, ordinary, or absolute blunders. There is no reason for this, because a great many simplified Civil War maps exist that could have and should have been included in this edition, or, if copyright were an issue, re-drawn. That they were not included is a professional disgrace to the publisher."
1,Can't believe Joel and his mom are pshing this!,"$20 for a 16-minute simple, unimaginative chair workout!! Are you kidding me? Of course this is not mentioned in the advertising!This is worth about $2.50 or could be on three pieces of paper with stick figures and cost nothing. Harper and model mom must be laughing all the way to their Swiss bank. Please don't give them more of your money until he and mum produce something of integrity and substance. This is a blatant rip-off which could have easily been avoided by selling it cheaper or adding some meat and potatoes!! I get nauseated and have fits every time I think of the Joel Harper's Fit Pack Chair Workout! Bleeck!"
5,"""An ingenious composer, a true musician""","What a treat! So often, we do not get the opportunity to hear pure music, classified as jazz. This music is complex, and does not undermine the intelligence of the listener. This music swings, it touches the soul, and is truly timeless. I highly reccommend this CD. Thank you, Amazon.com!"
2,Not as good as Goebel or Jacobs performances,"This disc includes Der Streit zwischen Phoebus und Pan, BWV 201 sung by Eva Csapo and Patrizia Kwella, Jean Nirouet, Paul Elliott, Hein Meens, Michael Schopper and David Thomas, under conductor Hans Martin Linde.As a filler Isabelle Poulenard sings Non sa che sia dolore, BWV 209."
5,sad story but a great book,"This is one of the most unforgettable books I've read. When it was published, I had the impression from the press that it was about the Du Pré family's bad feelings towards Daniel Barenboim who abandoned his helpless wife. That impression was completely wrong. Jacqueline's sister and brother don't say much about Barenboim. When they do, they only say good things about him. Barenboim was even interviewed by Hillary for this book. I don't believe at all he ever remarked ""Couldn't they have waited until I was dead?"" like someone wrote in Wikipedia. Hillary is an excellent writer. She describes everything so well that you almost feel as if you'd known Jacqueline personally."
4,A good read,This book is a travel journal and autobiography in one. The personality of Julia Child shines through in Alex Prud'Homme's writing. I enjoyed the characterizations of people the Childs knew during their foreign service years and the peek into post WW II Europe of the 50's. An excellent period piece. The photos included are also a treat.
5,"Paris, food and love","This was a perfect book of its kind- the memoir of a talented and interesting person at just the right place.Julia Child was always one of my heroes. I spent quite a few hours as a child watching her on tv and thinking that she was lovely and that I wanted to grow up to cook like her. This book tells me how her life was changed by France. The evocative description of her first meal there is a moment captured in time.The book deals with the culture of France, her marriage, her family back home and the physical pleasures of a land where good taste reigns.I love that I feel that I am right there with Julia as she tries new recipes for her cookbook or she and Paul go discovering together.Jolly- pure pleasure."
5,Highly entertaining,"She has such an easy, relaxed style that makes it feel like she is sitting with you telling her stories."
4,An amazing portrait of an amazing person,"Wow, this is a great portrayal of an extraordinary personality. As others have said, she is remembered as a parody of cooking shows, but this book really makes her come to life. She LOVED France and LOVED to cook. She really wanted to share her love of French food with Americans, and by writing her cook book, she did it. I remember trying to cook from it in high school--it seemed so difficult. But I cooked more recipes a couple years ago, and I can now appreciate how she revolutionized food in America. She was the Food Channel--before any one ever thought of it. This book really shows her vivid personality, good humor, dogged tenacity and zest for life (hackneyed as that phrase is, she really sounds like an amazing person)!"
5,My life in France,Excellent book. Give much insight into Julia Childs life and her travail in writing the definitive book on French cooking. If you want to understand how cooking (and shopping) should be done it is a must read.
5,Awesome book!,I bought this book after having watched the movie Julie and Julia and believe me it does not disappoint.
5,Fun Read!!,"My Life in France is a book wonderful. I picked the book up on whim at the store, and then I couldn't put it down. Julia Child was an amazing person, the story of her life and how she became who she was a joy to read. This book is for cooks and anyone who enjoys an amazing story of life!!"
3,I wish I could speak French!,"Julia was definitely a trail blazer, a unique individual the book was enjoyable. Although Julia is all about the food I wish the book had been more about her and her family. It would have been an easier read for those of us who are French deficient to have more translations."
4,"get to know Julia Child - funny, sweet, candid, and smart","I was born in 1974, so by the time I understood who Julia Child was, her media persona had sort of overshadowed her *actual* personality. I always knew she was vivacious, strong, and an amazing chef, but I had no idea how she *got* there.This book was wonderful. I'm not interested in France OR cooking (I'm a vegetarian, as well, so French food is usually not something I eat!) but I still enjoyed this book immensely. There's so much in it that inspired me- the fact that Julia Child knew nothing about French food besides what she liked and dove into it headfirst, the way she embraced the culture and made it her own, the way she brought that magic she found in France with her wherever she went for her life, and then the way she shared that passion with her audience after she became a media sensation.This is a terrific book about/by a terrific lady. Whether or not you are interested in cooking, France, Julia Child... I highly recommend it."
5,Hooray! Woe! Phoey!Whoopee!,"Julia Child's voice lives with this enthusiastic and revealing memoir of someone we know and love: Julia Child. Alex Prud'homme must be given credit in organizing this delightful memoir.The enthusiasiam and hard choices that Julia(Julie)made are narrated in the most delightful manner; just like being Right There.Ah, much is delicious. Superb lunches. finding her calling in a simple way by taking cooking classes and then her mind and passion kicked in and we are swept away on the journey of discovery and relentless trial and error.Woe! for the error. Hooray for the victory! Woe for the setbacks! as here, in the end, NEVER looking back, but always looking forward to Great fun with food and life ahead!"
4,It is a good book.,"I like the book. However, I have to admit I wish it was written by Julia Child herself."
3,"Factual, but Superficial","Wally Kroeker has written a short work about Russian Mennonites. It does give some factual information about the history, but fails to adequately explain the faith behind the works. Mr. Kroeker tends to view the tenets of the Anabaptist faith as cultural peculiarities.This book might be a good inexpensive work, but Mr. Kroeker needs to spend a considerable amount of time with the Old Colony or the more conservative Kleine Gemeinde to get a better grasp of exactly WHY they do the things they do. That's whats missing!"
2,A Primitive Book,A superficial review of the history of Mennonites who migrated to Russia and later left for the West. The book could have fit into an article - lots of verbiage but no deep analysis and a very superficial retelling of facts.
2,decent,to me it was decent iliked how it is suppoedly based on real events and i though it could of ben a tad bit better if some of th escn werent so dark and maybe a little bit longer but i still liked waht it was and mostly hwo it was suppsoedly based on real events
3,Primeval,"In one of the most remote places on earth, a bloodthirsty serial killer has claimed over 300 victims, and is still at large to this day. The danger begins as producer Tim Freeman, cameraman Steven Johnson and their rag-tag team set out on a journey up-river in search of their subject. But the deeper they probe into the mystery of this elusive assassin, the deadlier their trip becomes. This movie is fast paced, bloody, scary even funny in spots. Gustave is based off of a serial killer that turns out to be a crocodile."
3,Snappier than you'd expect,"I was surprised by the content of this movie; much more than a cheesy monster fest, it mixed in some real elements of civil strife and military oppression taking place in Africa today. There were two monsters to contend with here, and their juxtaposition works reasonably well. The use of expansive settings contrasted with closed in, dark & foggy environments, gave some texture to this story. By no means an Academy award winner, it's a good mix of action, adventure, and horror, that delivers what's promised."
5,"Love the ""Practice Makes Perfect"" series!","I have been studying Spanish on my own for the last year or so, using various books, audio, and computer programs. I'm at an intermediate level and have been finding it hard to get out of beginning Spanish and move comfortably to more advanced levels. Thank goodness I finally found the ""Practice Makes Perfect"" series. I wasted my time with most of those other books and programs. These books provide excellent explanations and enough exercises to allow you to truly learn and understand the language. Of course you might have to buy more than one, since they each focus on different aspects of the language, but it's worth it. So far I've purchasedPractice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns And Prepositions,Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Verb Tenses, andPractice Makes Perfect: The Spanish Subjunctive Up Close. I'm working with the first two at the same time--I've found that they supplement each other pretty well."
3,Playing on many levels of free jazz,"Taylor Ho Bynum started with free jazz icon Anthony Braxton, and has began making his own CD's in 1999. This 2007 set has Mary Halvorson on guitar, Tomas Fujiwara on drums, Matt Bauder on sax, Evan O'Reilly on guitar, and Jessica Pavone on cello. A trio starts the disc with ""Brooklyn With An E"", which has some good interaction and playing. The sextet plays on everything else except for the last song. Taylor Ho Bynum takes a unique take on ""In A Silent Way"", though its on the Ornette Colemen level of free jazziness. Some of the other songs are freer, abandoning also notes and tempo. In addition to the opener, I like ""Bluebird Of Delhi"", ""JP & The Boston Suburbs: Part 1 & 2"", and ""Apace"". The other songs don't do as much for me, and drag this disc down to three stars."
5,absolutely brilliant,"I loved this book, especially the illustrations that were in the hard cover version. The stories made robots more interesting, appealling and dare I say human like. They all devleoped their own personalities, and eccentirc habits. Fantastic"
1,A disappointment,I ordered the book hoping to read about the history of Shiraz. Do not expect to find much of interest about the history of the city of Shiraz or the life of Hafez in this volume. The title is very misleading. It is based on the author's dissertaion- an excellent contribution to the academia and research libraries. A boring book and a disappointment.
4,Decent Brush,"Doesn't create static on wigs, which is really important for a wig brush. Well spaced and everything for breaking knots without pulling hair out."
5,Good Deal!!!,"Very good price, item is good quality and does what it needs to do, would definitely recommend anytime. had no issues at all with them"
5,Lasts long...,"Amazingly good pads. I live in So. Calif. and use the Slendertone Flex everyday. Pads are lasting over 30 days but I do not exercise while wearing them - just walk the dog. If you sweat, I would let the dry out a little before putting the pastic covers and putting unit back in pouch to prevent mold. I have never had this problem but have read about it."
5,The New Horse,"I loved this book! It's about Mel, and she's looking for a new horse and falls in love with a SUPER BLOODLINES HORSE! But, Hi Jinx has a horrible temper. But, AMAZING speed. She takes on the challenge. But, he hurts another race horse, chews and kicks at his stall, and tossed Mel off EVERY time she rides him! . Can Mel change all of his energy into speed? To find out Read this book!!"
1,rip off,"this is the same exact gun you find all over amazon, that is ONE CENT. They are trying to rip you off here. if you want to find the real one, just search mini p99 on amazon. DO NOT BUY THIS GUN."
4,Very practical book,"This is a very practical book, nothing fancy to do, no breakthrough methods. Just the tried and tested things to help your child."
4,Proven Methods For Treating ADHD,"For parents, raising a child who suffers from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder presents various challenges. As a doctor who treats ADHD and a mother of a son who suffers from ADHD, I know first hand that there are generally no magic ""cures"" or ""fixes."" However, the good news is that ADHD can be managed and children can not only thrive, but over time can come to view their condition as a special gift. The tips and methods in this book are proven and worth considering for any parent who is experiencing frustration."
5,Read it,I've read this booking after loosing alot of hope in being able to parent my child in a possitive manner. I think this has helped alot and would rcommend for others.
5,Love the information in this book!!,"As the parent of a 5 year old recently diagnosed with ADHD, I have been researching and trying to get as much information aspossible. This book is easy to understand and provides alot of information but is not overwhelming. It allows you to see things thru the eyes of a child with ADHD. The homework assisgnments at the end of each chapter are simple and pracatical. I'm only half way thru but so far thumbs up!!!!I would recommend this book to any parent of an ADHD child."
1,What is this?!,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DOCUMENT!!!It is an utter waste of money and ultimately it will leave you scratching your head wondering, ""what is this?!"""
5,Breath Of Fresh Air!,"I love this cd because I can feel the lord moving I don't feel that Myron or the group is trying to please the listener but catching the heart of god while he catches our ear this album is amazing this is a great debut album and songs like ""That Place"" ""I Can"" and ""Set Me Free"" are sure to be a hit everyone watch out for Myron Butler and Levi."
3,"Annoying ""feature""","This phone/answering machine has one of the stupidest design flaws I've ever encountered: it is possible to turn the phone's ringer off, but not to turn the answering machine's volume off! The lowest the answering machine goes is to 1. So suppose you want to take a nap and not be disturbed. You turn the phone's ringer off. You set the answering machine's volume to 1, thinking that even if someone calls and leaves a message, it'll be low enough not to wake you up. Well, you'll be WRONG, because this stupid answering machine, even whith the volume set to 1, lets out the loudest BEEEEEP at the end of a message! What's the point of turning the phone ringer's off, then?(Otherwise, the phone works fine, no interference, etc.)"
3,Canon can be a pain at times,"I like my camera, it's durable and functional. The gizmo's are pretty much kept to a minimum. THOUGH, Sony has a patent on a night-vision mode that NONE of the Canon's have, which is pretty cool if you've seen it first hand. And something that stinks with many Canon products (in my experience -with scanners and camcorders) drivers and what-not always seem to be a ROYAL PAIN."
1,do not buy this camera or ignore these posts,"A lot of these cameras get errors that canon can't fix, period. I've used mine only a few times. check the web under ""remove tape errora"" Don't be a sucker."
5,An eye-opener!,"This book will shake your foundation when it comes to your understanding of sexuality in Ancient Greece. It seems that what some civilizations consider unnatural, others consider wholly natural and beautiful. You may not like what you read, but if you cherish Ancient Greek culture, for whatever reasons, this book will give you insight into their sexual practices."
3,A disappointment,"I remember loving these series in the mid '50s when, I hate to admit, I was an early teen. I thought Life with Elizabeth was hilarious and laughed out loud. It was zany and silly and fun. Love That Bob was sexy for its day (a little later than Life with Elizabeth if I remember correctly) with Cummings as a sexy photographer who romanced his models (and played his own grandfather as well). Sadly, they haven't traveled well. Not because there was lack of talent or creativity -- but times and mores and changed and they are very dated. But it was interesting to see what we wore and what we thought was funny then."
1,Cute,"Cute, cute cute... We have a brand-new grandchild and can't wait to share ""Katy Cat and Beaky Boo"" with him (once he's a few months older). ""I like eating fish. What do you eat, Beaky Boo? Grass? Bananas? Cheese? Sardines?""(The main reason we ordered this book in the first place is because our rescued senior-citizen cat is named ""Katy."")"
4,For $100-$150 a good bargain,"For the $100 - $150 price a very good bargain. Durable, good looking (with excellent stainless steel polished look), good features (the ones for aviators actually are useful!). The watch is large and heavy however but this is typical of watches geared to aviators."
4,"Never fear, kids, the story's gettin' better!","I *really* enjoyed getting not only some backstory on Kathryn Pulaski, but also some knowledge of what she did *after* she left the Enterprise. It's nice to have some blanks filled in so expertly!This story increases the complexity not only of the plotline, but of the virus itself. Great character interaction between Dukat and Pulaski. Good insight into life on Terok Nor before the Feds stepped in.Another step further along the twisted double helix of this story. Let's hope the next one is just as intriguing."
3,Good deal though cheap quality,"I bought this stool set for my classroom. I liked the retro design. The stools are very light though and not very good quality. It isn't very comfortable either. I rarely sit on it in my classroom, becausse it hurts my tush and back after more than a very minutes. The students like to sit in it during presentations though! :-)"
3,"Groundbreaking, but tired.","""Cats"" was extremely important for its time & paved the way for many future musicals. Currently, its the longest running show in Broadway history ... thankfully, though, Webber's masterpiece, ""Phantom of the Opera"" will take the crown in early 2006.Despite a talented Company (esp. Betty Buckley & Terrence Mann), the score has generally not aged well and seems rather trite by today's standards.There are, however, a couple of good tracks, namely ""Jellicle Songs For Jellicle Cats"" & the classic ""Memory""."
3,Good Performances save nonsensical soundtrack.,"CATS is basically a series of vaguely connected songs in a variety of styles that can be made or broken by the performances. Luckily, the Broadway cast in this recording is as good as it gets. Talented vets like Betty Buckley, Terrence Mann, and Ken Page do a great job with material that is fairly silly, to say the least. With the exception of the pomposity of ""Growltiger's Last Stand"" with its faux opera, the music moves along in a pleasant fashion and it is a nice reminder of a musical that despite its shortcomings had an exceptional run."
3,not for babies,"Nice, good quality hat, but there are no straps or anything that keeps it on my son. It's a bit snug so I assuming they designed it to 'snug' around his head to stay on. But he just pulls it off."
4,Family Dog,"A well written book with simple instructions to train your dog. Althought I personally do not agree with his methods of physical reprimands, the ideas and information is very valuable. From the very beginning the training is simple and strait forward. I will use many of the ideas suggested in this book with our new puppy. The key is consistancy and repetition."
5,Can't say enough good things.,If you are getting a dog and want to know how to make it into a good pet. GET THIS BOOK. It is awesome!!
3,A good book if you need tips.,The book provided too many tips and not enough photographs; which Victoria is known for. I wish I could have ripped out the last 10 pages and thrown the rest away.
3,better books out there,"I would rather recomment Horn and Johnson's Matrix Analysis,since their book is much better."
3,What Happened to the Illustrations?,"I am in agreement with the other reviewers who commented on the poor quality of this reproduction of what was a fabulously illustrated children's alphabet book with a lovely verse and the lesson about giving to tie it all together. However, I went ahead and bought the book for a baby gift and I was very disappointed in the overall faded appearance of the illustrations compared with the original award winning version. It was my children's favorite alphabet book; and the new version doesn't even come close to the original as far as quality of the illustrations, which is what picture books are all about, isn't it? They should really look into re-doing it again. I wouldn't recommend buying it if you have seen the original, there is no comparison."
4,A fun noir romp,"The pages of this book fly by, filled with all the dark, dangerous, drugs and sex riffs from the 1950's. When you need something light and engrossing, this book is a ""sinister"" diversion."
3,Just Ok,I love these tablets but I was surprised to see that a daily dosage is 10 tablets. That means that this bottle only has 10 days worth.I think that's a bit pricey.I have been having 5 tablets in the morning and that seems to work.I'm not sure I will buy this again. Might look for something a little less expensive or in powder form to mix into my morning shake.But the actual product seems good. And 5 tablets seems to be enough for me.
2,"Would prefer a ""secular"" version","Most of the information in this book is really not earth shattering and is basic common sense. Also, this book is NOT for non-Christians and should really mention the fact that it is very Christian-based in its title or description-- I was completely taken aback by it and frankly, put off."
4,beyond the rational,"it is possible to read this for what it is and to split the reading into doubt. either is valid.you either feel the sucking throttling of Hunab Ku...or you don't (yet).i dislike new age fluff myself, but this isn't that...read all the materials, the counter-arguments. then let it ferment. you'll figure it out.celebrate this or not. but don't spin your wheels. unless thatis temporarily your path.2006 and counting....!"
5,Peter Mayle is Great,"Was loaned ""A Year In Provence"" and loved it. Have since read this and all of Mayle's other books and loved every one."
4,Fine performances with antique taste--4.5 stars,"This CD reminds me of the fine Telemann chamber music CDs (e.g. Ton Koopman's, B000005EBS, & The Chandos Baroque Players, B0000002ZIV). The nice 3-language (German, English, French) write-up by Ingeborg Allihn in the accompanying booklet quotes Telemann's autobiography: ""I believe that pleasing the multitude is better than catering for the few."" This CD includes one overture-suite, 1 concerto, & 4 sonatas (one a trio sonata). Other CDs with Telemann sonatas include: Rampal's ""The Romantic Flute"" (B000001VHZ) & EMI Classics ""Baroque Telemann: Concertos & Sonatas"" (B000002S5Z). The differences in instrumentation between antique instrument CDs & the modern ones is quite distinct. Enjoy!"
5,This flick is money yo!,Not only is the soundtrack off the hook but this flick manages2 B retro n' modern at the same time without lookin' dated.It's money!
4,Blu-Ray Review,$10.00 even at my local Walmart here in CT. Why are Amazon's prices higher than Walmart and Best Buy? Amazon used to have the lowest prices on almost everything but Not anymore.
5,Jackie Brown Gets Down,"It's a shame to prominently feature such a negative and dismissive review of 'Jackie Brown' because it really is Quentin Tarrantino's finest hour. This film is not Quentin's take on Blaxploitation films, as so many movie critics seem to assume. This is a very soulful movie about survival in all of it's forms. Most of the characters in this movie are just trying to get by, to cling to what they have because it's all they know. This probably resonates a bit more for those of us who are a little more mature, or have ever felt trapped by the circumstances of our own lives. Bottom line though, this movie holds up because it is a well told, thoroughly engrossing, incredibly well acted story. Robert Deniro is hilarious, Sam Jackson is evil incarnate, and Robert Forster and Pam Grier are positively luminous. Don't let that review discourage you. This is a very worthy and entertaining film."
4,"Entertaining, humorous movie","Jackie Brown is the type of movie that captivates you because of the characters and the way they're portrayed. The acting in this movie is incredible. Samuel L. Jackson definitely led the cast, playing Ordell Robbie, and took over the film the moment he spoke his first line. Robert De Niro seemed pretty wasted as Jackson's partner, Louis. This movie is also very humorous, with a side splitting scene featuring Jackson and Chris Tucker arguing. The movie had a lot more scenes with the potential for huge laughs like in Pulp Fiction, but unfortunately takes a different turn into deep drama."
4,Jackie Brown Dvd,Jackie Brown is classic movie so I wanted the dvd and could not find it in stores. I orderd it and it came on time. packaged was fine.liked everything.
5,Pam Grier is the bomb! Robert Forester is the sleeper!,Put your trust in Tarantino - he seldom disappoints - certainly not this this time around either! A real boutique cast with everyone stepping up in a contemporary crime thriller where everything is not always as it seems.This story goes by like a bullet - don't deprive yourself - catch this flick!
4,Jackie Brown is one Bad Mutha!,"Jackie Brown is one of those movies where you can't quite figure out what's going to happen next and then are pleasantly surprised when it does happen! Jackie is one bad mutha! Follow her and the terrific cast through a Pulp Fiction-like adventure. The director's viewpoint is fabulous and keeps it interesting. A few times in this movie I feel there is some extra camera time that could have been deleted, but otherwise a great movie!"
1,"Plodding, tedious, dull and boring","How on earth anyone could take an Elmore Leonard book and turn it into one of the most excruciatingly boring movies ever made remains beyond me. Tarantino had no sense of pacing whatsoever on this disastrous excursion. The movie moves at the speed of mammal evolution.Quentin failed at adapting the book. He sucked all the life from the novel then filmed the corpse. Avoid it at all costs, because it's 2 and a half hours of your life you'll never get back."
3,Missing Top and Bottom,"Jackie Brown is a masterpiece, one of my top five favorite movies. I was ecstatic when it came out on DVD. Everything is perfect except for one thing: In order to stretch the movie to widescreen format, they cropped off the top and bottom of the picture. I thought the purpose of widescreen was to show the whole movie! When I put in my old VHS copy, it turns out there is more missing from the top and bottom of the widescreen DVD than there is from the left and right of the normal screen VHS. So what? Bridget Fonda's entire butt is missing off the bottom of the screen as she leaves the room after her ""love"" scene with Robert De Niro. This is a serious flaw! I hope they someday release a ""Standard Edition"" that shows the entire original frame. Still, the sound and picture quality are so superior to the VHS, I will be obliged to watch this DVD time after time."
5,"Better Then ""Pulp Fiction!""","Pam Grier, Queen of the 70's Blaxploitation, is Back!!! She may be in her 40's, but she still oozes sexyness out of every pore as if it was going out of style. With the rest of the A-list cast( includeing my favorite Bobby DeNiro) she gives us a caper case like nothing I've seen since ""Bound"" As Max Cherry would say: "" It's Good"""
5,Perfect Film,"Not one moment of this movie was predictable, trite, boring. All the actors were superbly cast, the storyline was fascinating. Maybe one of the best crime movies ever made. Unfairly overlooked at the box office. For the life of me I don't know why. What I wouldn't give for something of this caliber from Tarantino (or anyone) in the near future."
3,quite creative but not very entertaining,Quite artistic and creative. However I was disappointed since I was looking for popular entertainments and this film is not.
2,I didn't like it.,"After seeing the brilliant ""Pulp fiction"" I went and had a look at the trailer for ""Jackie Brwon"", it looked good -- but think again. Trailers can sometimes be wrong. It was meant that this would have more action than Pulp fiction, but this didn't have any sort od action what so ever. The cast is quite nice though, Quentin always knows to pick the right people, they played their interesting characters well. The story was quite cool, but it jjust got to complicated. There was lots of dialogue, but it wasn't interesting at all. Un-intersting dialogue=boring. The movie dragged a lot too, it seemed like Quentin was making the film long on purpose. If you're expecting anything like ""Pulp fiction"" then you won't like this. It's nothing like it. I wouldn't buy this, Pulp fiction fans. Probably just Tarantino fans. However, Chris Tucker did shine some light in the movie, but he isn't in it for long."
4,What is life about?,"Kemp Powers tells his story about an unimaginable moment at 14 when he accidentally killed his best friend in a gun accident. The actual shooting is described in just a few pages, the remainder is Kent Power's life before and after, impacted forever by that moment.The real pull of the book is the undercurrents about life and fate. There are no answers except the story."
4,Lot to desire,"The book arrived in a timely manor, and in very good shape. I love the game, but the book leaves a lot to be desired. I think that Mark Walker is a much better author, and should write more game guides; but I am happy with the book I have for now. thanks."
1,Junk,"Knobs fell off of back of clock within a couple of weeks and the pins sticking out were so short that you cannot adjust the time and alarm settings without these knobs. I bought this for my senior mom since she likes the analog clocks and everything around is digital. This clock was replacing the one that my mom had for about 15 years that finally broke. My mom is in a senior home across town and I was out of town for 2 weeks on business. I immediately contacted the merchant that I purchased from and informed them about how cheap the quality of this product was. The bottom line was, 30 day return/exchange policy no exceptions. Clock was thrown in the recycle (since it's pretty much plastic) and I am out the money plus shipping. I will not order from this company or clock manufacture ever again."
1,Too loud,"My husband got this clock to keep on his nightstand for quick reference in the dark hours. However, its ticking is so loud that we can't stand to have it anywhere in the bedroom. We tossed it."
1,ITEM NOT AS DESCRIBED.....,"I saw this watch online and lovd it...after I ordered it I then read the reviews. I wish I read them before but I was sooooo excited that I just bought it. When my watch came, which was a xmas present, it was scuffed around the band and it wasn't even the same watch. The case was also broken and it didn't even comewith instructons. I was so mad.....amazon should really step in with this seller...its not fair to us buyeres.....it was all I had for my godchild s present....and felt stupid having to justify what was wrong with it.....he kept it just the same...he's young and didn't care.....BUYER BEWARE....don't take that chance like I did and hope for the best......"
1,Not very good at all,"I had heard a lot of hype about this novel, but it just didn't live up to it. I have to say that I agree with the reviewer who said that this book gets praise because the characters are white. While Baldwin does deal with some fundamental relationship issues, his knowledge of audience -to be blunt-- believing that only white gays read books in the 50's- leaves the book hollow at it's core. I was always told that great literature comes from finding the universal in the specific, and Baldwin can't find the specific here because he is too afraid to present inner thoughts that could have lifted this novel up.To the other reviewer, color does have a lot to do with Baldwin's literature, and it does influence his writing. I am an amatuer Baldwin scholar, and I know his workd well, race should have been in this book. The fact that it is absent here, to me, says that his heart was not fully in this novel, only his head. And that's not great literature."
4,"disturbing, unpleasant, but what a read!","Although this was a book I read in one stretch, I had mixed feelings about the story after the last page. One of the striking things about the book was how recognisable the characters still are. The story is written in 1956, about the Paris gay scene of 1953. The story I read was about Amsterdam 1999.The main thing that bothered me was the main character. David is a guy who has the power to transmit to everyone around him a sense of defeat and purposelessness. He is an emotional parasite, who flourishes by draining out of Giovanni and Hella the vitality that both are trying to preserve with difficulty.In a certain way, I feel that the story should not have been told the way we read it. David (the main character) is a writer. He emotionally destroyed the two people closest to him. And instead of hiding out in shame, he tells us every nasty detail of it."
1,seen better,Not what i expected it was not in very good shape with pages falling out. stains of some sort on the cover. not worth what i paid.
2,Base is a pain in the you know what!!,"The base tipped over with my baby in it also when he was only a few weeks old. I stopped using it and was just doing it with the seat belt, but with a two door car it would be easier for me to use the base, i tried on several occasions to try and get it to stay but it would not. The first time it happened to me i had i turning corners and holding the seat until i was able to stop and take it out. Piece of crap!!!"
1,Dangerous,Do not buy! The infant car seat is not safe at all! My poor son flipped over in it when it was securley fastened. It is not safe and should be recalled!
2,Buyer Beware...Try it out before buying!!!!,"We purchased this travel system because we liked how sturdy it seemed. My husband thinks the car seat/carrier is too heavy, but to me that makes it seem more sturdy. I LOVE the stroller. It is extremely easy to maneuver, and very user-friendly! We had absolutely no trouble when our son was small, but now, the car seat will tip over when you go around a corner. No matter which way we install this seat (seat belt or tether straps), we cannot get it tight enough. I think it must be our car (we have a montero), because not everyone has this trouble. I highly recommend that you try it in your car before you purchase this. As any parent would agree, the safety of your child is most important!!!!!"
4,It's what I was looking for,"I have worked in a lot of projects, large and small, but all the ones I personally managed were small and run by the S.O.P.M Methodology (Seat-of-the-Pants). When I signed up for a community-college P.M. class, all they wanted to talk about was ""soft skills"", team bonding, Kum-Bah-Yah stuff. Necessary, but not the nuts-and-bolts. I got my money back - I wanted meat-and-potatoes Project Managment. To me, this book has a good overview of basics with common sense, then some good specific techniques with more detail. Plus, it goes cradle-to-grave. I have not finished, and I have not run the exercises yet. Maybe I'll come back and add a different rating after that. I wouldn't buy it to learn Microsoft Project software."
5,Are You Ready for a Transformation?,"Thrive! is a book of powerful poems and essays that will stimulate your mind, encourage your heart and lift your spirit. Ms. Scott shares herself and her strategies with great wisdom, courage, passion and compassion. She empowers the reader to embark on a journey that will change her/his life forever!The 7 strategies are simple and applicable to real-life. Ms. Scott helps you see yourself,others and life in general, with a new perspective.Ms. Scott helps her readers move from unhealthy and fractured, to healthy and whole individuals who know to seek their purpose."
5,MUST BE DONE ON CD!!,"This is one of the most entertaining kid's Bible songs. It is different than the overdone praise songs, and my church kids love it! we did a play using the songs a few years ago, it was amazing! I would love to do it again, but I need it on CD and in split track or instrumental (even better) pleaaaaaaaase :-)Patricia"
1,"Good idea, really bad songs","I was so excited about getting this CD for my kids, love Scripture songs. But when I got it and listened to it I realized the songs are really bad. Don't waste your money."
4,Cheesy but solid,"If you're not a fan of cheesy kid songs, you'll probably want to pass on this.If you don't mind (or even like) cheesy stuff and you're looking for songs that teach biblical stories chronologically without adding to or changing the story, then you want this.The narrator has a soothing, grandfatherly voice and explains concepts to transition in between songs. We use it in the car, but it's Bible-saturated enough to use one song at a time during family devotion/worship times. That's fantastic because our kids (ages 1 and 3) don't have a long attention span for a long Bible story if it's just read aloud. I think it will continue to be useful as they get older as well, and I plan to give it as a gift to several of our friends (which is the highest compliment I can give to a resource like this)."
3,I question the movie's accuracy....,"This was a good movie but there were some things that didn't seem right-- why would Carla have never been to a dance or had a boyfriend if she'd been ""a very popular girl."" as her school principal said to her dad? I know people who went to a school similar to Carla's and they had dances and some of them had boyfriends and girlfriends-- I would think any school with teenagers in it, period, would have these things to some degree!"
4,Heartfelt.,"The Other Sister starring Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi is an excellent, funny, and bittersweet story of love. Both these gifted actors played mentally handicapped people who fall in love. Director Garry Marshall cranks out another solid and feel-good film, I have always loved his movies. Diane Keaton also stars as Lewis's overprotective mother who is afraid her daughter will get hurt emotionally. I highly recommend it!"
4,Heartwarming movie w/ tears and fears.,"This is a story about a mentally retarded girl who just wanted her independence as most young people do at a certain time. She falls in love with another mentally ill boy when going to a polytechnic school in the SF bay area. I found nothing wrong with their acting and I thought they both did a great job portraying mentally retarded people convincingly. In the end, the two get married in a church much to their mother's dismay, but it was a happy ending that brought tears to my eyes. I only wish they could make a sequel to see what their life is like after marriage.I recommend this film to anyone looking for a good natured story that will warm your heart and move you to tears and laughs constantly. It may also change your views on mentally ill people as well."
5,Love this movie,One of my favorite movies of all time! Make sure you have a box of tissues handy while watching it.
4,Mr. Mocker is about a mocking bird who came from the south,"I liked this book third best because the book is aboutthe mystery of the mocking bird and now I am going to tell youwhat I mean. Well the story is about two little green forestpeople and a mocking bird. And near the end of the book itbecomes about all of the little people in the green forest andthe green meadows. And if you want to know, those two littlegreen forest people are Sammy Jay and Sticky Toes the tree toad,who people say were talking in the night when they were reallysound asleep. But soon everyone found out it was the MockingBird that was making all the noise in the night. And at theend they had a little party and everything turned out fine.Review by Mairead Hynes Age 6"
2,best little stories from WWll,"A more accurate title for this book would be ""Little stories from WWll""Many stories have no beginning and worse, have little or at best an anti climactical ending.I'm NOT a WWll vet, however, I can come up with better stories than this book. Couldn't finish the book---too boring."
5,"Full of interest & history, little known",This tells so many personal stories of those living during WWII...so I am learning many stories to share with others!! Check this one out!!
3,Suggest the Graphic Novel,"The story is told well, but that's because Cover is working off of Stracynski's original story. The Graphic Novel is better. I was hoping for more insite into characters, more depth than can be put into the GN, but that isn't so. If this had more depth I'd have appreciated it more. For what I got out of this novel, I could have read the Graphic Novel (and did prior to reading this). I got nothing new about the characters, no new details or insites into the chararacters or the story. Pity. If Cover had done more with it, it could have been quite good, considering he had really great material to work with."
5,JMS makes the superhero genre his own,"Think of everything that's wrong with the superhero genre: cardboard characters, insipid plots, meaningless battles for no good reason, powerful blows that somehow no-one ever dies from, etc. Rising Stars is at the complete opposite end of the spectrum from all that. I don't think a more intelligent superhero comic has ever been written.JMS has clearly given a lot of thought to what makes each character tick, and how they fit in (or don't fit in). For the most part, the characters seem to be drawn from real-world personalities, exaggerated to superpowered proportions, which helps the book's psychological plausibility.Rising Stars is also totally engrossing. I just bought the second volume and I can't wait until it arrives."
1,Not My Cup of Tea,"I found this book very dull, so much so I gave up half way through it. The three days I was readingthe book felt like the longest ""month"" of my life. I have to admit that the book was given to me; I did not go out looking for it. Becuase it was given to me, I felt a responsiblity to keep reading. This in not an area I am interested in which is a bit part of my review. I would assume that at this point the book would be outdated."
5,CINNABAR THE ONE OCLOCK FOX,I read this book when I was probably in the third or fourth grade.Somehow the story has stuck with me all these years. And if my memory serves me correctly the story and the pictures are wonderful.I would take this book out of the library every summer and take it on vacation. I find it hard to believe that copies are so hard to come by for a story that tugs on the heart strings of young and old.If It made a reader out of me it will make a reader out of alot of kids that get bored with reading. Everyone will absolutely love this story.... :-)
2,incompatibility issues,"Bought one new. Doesn't work in any of the following cameras:Olympus C4040, C3020, C4000, E20. Got ""media error"" when tryingto format. Can't access it from a PC using a PCMCIA adaptor.Can format and read/write fine using a Memorex USB reader.Filed a warranty claim with Kingston and got a replacement.Still can't work in E20 but can work in a C4040. Will sell iton eBay soon."
1,TOO SMALL - Poor Finish,"NOT HAPPY... Each can contains 150ML or about 5.072 US fluid ounces. Following the instructions I applied numerous light coats. I had hoped for a smooth finish, but the results were a speckles finish. I have done just a few CD's and the first can is almost empty. The price of $7.99 plus $5.49 shipping might be worth it if these were 12 or 16 ounces, but this is a very small can. WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN8-25-2012 UPDATE - Too much hassle to use this spray. I have gone on to using Glossy printable CD's, wow do these look great. The little extra cost is well worth a finished CD that looks like it came from a Music Store."
2,Algunos clásicos,"Me sigue encantando HOMBRE G, pero en cuanto a este DVD pensé que iba a tener videos más populares sólo tiene algunos, no está tan completo y tiene unos que ni conocía. Los videos son: 1. por qué no ser amigos, 2. qué soy yo para tí. 3. no lo sé. 4. lo noto. 5. no te escaparás. 6. voy a pasármelo bien. 7. chico tienes que cuidarte. 8.Rita. 9. Esta es tu vida. 10. Una mujer de Bandera. Saludos y añadiré tus críticas."
4,"Good quality, Good fit","Arrived quickly, quality is good and the fikt good. I wear a 2x and this size, in white, very difficult to find. This was very convenient"
2,Fly opening is too short,"I'm used to manufacturers/retailers constantly cutting corners and cheapening the product. Never mind the inferior cotton/poly blend, the lack of elastic in the waistband, the limited of choice in sizing, I expected all that at this price. What is truly astounding and unforgivable is an opening that is does not come down far enough to function for its intended purpose. Another reviewer flagged this, but I didn't quite believe it. Here you have a major brand name in underwear that cannot design a simple product. These shorts are an insult to the customer. Amazon would be better advised not to traffic in such garbage or use its clout to make Hanes get it right."
5,Loved It!,"I went out one day on a whim and decided to see this when it was in the theatre and I loved it! I don't often always see a lot of the animated movies in the theatre, but instead wait until dollar theatre or Netflix or something, but I had seen everything else at the theatre at the time I wanted to see and wound up seeing this. Loved it! It was among one of the better animated movies I had seen around that time, other than like Toy Story 3, and later Rango and Kung Fu Panda 2. I bought this up on Blu-Ray right when it came out and have watched it several times since. If you're at all into animated movies, this is definitely one to watch. It's overall pretty good for kids, though there are a couple of parts that might be scary. I'd say it's good for maybe ages 5+. In any case though, this is a must see animated movie! I highly recommend it!"
2,Entertaining but the message is simplistic hogwash,"I enjoyed the movie in terms of the comedy and the characterizations, but I was extremely sorry that I brought my grandchildren to see it because of the dangerously naive message it conveys: If we are kind and understanding to our enemies, they will stop fighting us and become our friends. This is lovely in fantasy realms, but does anyone really believe it will work in the real world? Look at where this kind of thinking got Neville Chamberlain and Europe in WWII. I would not recommend this movie unless you want your kids and grandkids to be indoctrinated into allowing people to walk all over them."
5,Fantastic movie for kids and adults alike,"I watched this movie because the trailers were funny and it got good reviews when it was out. Just rented it here on Amazon and I got to say I really like this movie. I usually do reviews for movies I like, but this movie has got to be the best one I have seen in a long while. I just watched Robin Hood and this one tops that. The animations are very detailed and nice to watch. The story is fantastic, and the movie is just really funny and thrilling. There are comedic moments to dim the thrilling scenes and it goes well together. I would really recommend this movie for your kids or anyone else, it is fantastic."
5,My 2 yr old's new favorite,Amazon is the best place to buy DVD's not only do they have a great selection but they are a great price. THnaks
5,A Very Special Movie,"This is the first review I've written for Amazon. I just saw ""How To Train Your Dragon"" with my daughter. It was a most enjoyable film and the characters were charming, including the dragons. The voice of Craig Ferguson added to the enjoyment. Being a 69-year-old woman I didn't expect to be so entertained by an animated film. I would recommend this film to anyone regardless of their age. It was refreshing to watch a movie without excessive violence, and I felt very good after seeing it. This is the best movie I have seen in a really long time!"
4,How to Train Your Dragon,"What a cute movie!! I'm usually not into Viking movies of any kind, but this one was a winner! For it to be animated (well done animation), it was quite adorable for people of all ages. It has both drama and comedy in it, along with adventure, of course. The dragon, Toothless, stole the show! He's so cuddly and cute and reminds me of both a dog and a cat! Your whole family will enjoy this one!!!"
4,Great for entire family.,"My wife and I enjoyed this very much, it's an excellent family movie night movie. The dragon flight scenes are great."
4,JUST ABOUT PERFECT,"For me, this was by far the best of the 3-D animated films to reach the big screen this year. Not much is lost in the hi-def 2-D version now available. There are sweeping vistas, believable characters and a majestic sense of flying with the dragons.The story is simple. Hiccup, a young Viking, defies tradition by befriending a deadly foe, a ferocious dragon he calls Toothless. Together they must fight tradition and find a way to save both their worlds.Superbly designed in all aspects -- the characters, the world and the story come together to create a wondrously entertaining diversion for all ages. I don't say that loosely."
3,One thing to consider,"The movie looks amazing and is really great. I would like to make one comment as I have 2 boys - 3 years old and 5 years old.They say ""Kill"" a tremendous amount of times in the movie and the kids pick up on this. I am no prude by any means and Disney has plenty of issue with their kids movies as well. I do have friends who won't let their kids watch as the mention of killing over and over is a bit much."
5,Good movie,"I love this movie. It has a lot of action that might be a little too much for the much younger audience, but overall it is age appropriate. The visuals are amazing especially if it's on Blu Ray."
5,Great 3D movie,How to train your dragon is funny enough for kids and witty enough for adults. It is also one of the better 3D films I've seen effects wise. Easy 5 star review.
5,Loved it!,"I would recommend this movie to just about anyone! It's clean, extremely well-done, features eye-popping 3d, character development--the whole bit."
5,Enjoyable,I am 71 years of age and watched it with my 11 year old grandson. It was definitely written for the young but yet enjoyable for one of my age.
2,Not HD,"The description said HD quality, but its only dvd quality at best. Next time ill just stick to buying Blu-ray for HD."
5,Great Animated Film!,"I loved ""Kung Fu Panda"" so couldn't wait to see this movie when it came out (Dreamworks Studio made both). I loved this film. Probably the best use of 3D I have seen at a theater as well. It looks FANTASTIC on blu-ray. This is the only studio that is close to the quality of Pixar presently. If Toy Story 3 hadn't been released this year, there is no question this film would win for best animated film at Oscar time. In fact, it may give TS3 a run for its money. It's that good. This is also a great film to showcase your home theater system. Not only does it look fantastic, it sounds fantastic as well. Very intelligent dialogue, lots of humor, great animation, what more can you ask?"
4,"Fun, moving, and exciting","Hiccup, the spindly son of a Viking chieftain who does not fit in with the others, lives in a village eternally at war with dragons. He accidentally grounds a young one during a night attack, tracks it down, and ultimately befriends it.This is a terrific entertainment for kids who aren't too easily scared. There are plenty of laughs and eye-popping action scenes as well as good messages for young viewers, such as the importance of valuing differences in others, the necessity of cooperation, conquering fear by conquering ignorance, and the fact that it is often braver to put down one's weapons and work for peace than to keep on fighting."
5,Cute !,"This is my daughter's and my favorite movie! It's SOOO cute! We have a neighbors cat that comes around that is very fluffy and black , with green eyes that we have nicknamed, ""Toothless""! It is a sweet movie!"
4,Good family movie,I liked this movie a lot. It was original and fun to watch. It is an excellent family movie and we need those!
4,Satisfied buyer,"The item was received as described, in good condition, and delivered promptly. The DVD played smoothly with no skipping or any notable problems."
2,Not what was supposed to happen.,"I ordered this movie for my young daughter along with a blu ray player. I instead got Thor sent to me, with a How to Train Your Dragon sticker on it. I kept the movie I got for my son, and will just go to a store for the movie I originally wanted..."
5,Pleasant surprise,"How to train your dragon is one of my favorite animated movies of all time!I love everything about it. The music is perfect, the cinematography is great, and the story is touching. There are not many female characters, but the ones who are in the movie are strong, independent, and treated like equals. There is also an underlying theme about accepting individuals with disabilites. I can not think of another children's movie that has three major characters with prosthetic devices. I love that Hiccup's success is not attributed to him simply being smart. The movie clearly shows the work that go into his inventions and the many failures he has before finding successful designs. The best thing about all of these themes is that they are subtle. I also love how much Toothless reminds me of Stitch from Lilo & Stitch. If you love Lilo & Stitch, you will proably How to Train your Dragon as well."
3,How to train your dragon 3d,Great movie but 3D is kinda a let down. Never noticed how dark in terms of picture brightness this movie is. The first half hour can be pretty difficult to make out with your glasses on. Things get better during the daytime scenes but still not that wow factor I was hoping for. The flying sequences work out the best with nice depth to the image and good resolution. But overall the picture just seems dull without any pop to it. So I'm happy with the purchase just not really happy.
3,"Okay, fun to see Sharif again, but film doesn't go anywhere","I thought this film was good - a pretty standard coming-of-age film set in Paris and Europe. However, rent this only if you are looking just for yet another coming-of-age film without too many new angles. The ending leaves a lot to be desired, as it just kind of happens abrubtly, the kind of ""what's old is new again"" kind of ending.As someone else mentioned here, I just could not believe that when his mother eventually turned up, that he would just sort of blow her off. That was really dumb.""Summer of '42"" was a very similar story, but MUCH better done, and the performances were much, much better.It was fun to see such a film set in Paris, and Omar Sharif's eyes are as beautiful as ever, but there's really not to much else about this film to distinguish it from a whole bunch of other similar type films."
3,Silly but Cute,"I enjoyed the movie, but the plot has gaping holes, crudely stitched over; several of the characters (mainly the Jewish ones) are bi-dimensional, almost caricatures. The scene with the mother is flat and idiotic. The last scene redeems much of the flatness. Mr. Ibrahim says a lot of things that sound deep, but what does he really say? What does this character tell you? The movie is about a Jewish boy with Jewish parents that are less than pathetic, who says that for his father to be Jewish means to be depressed all the time and for himself - he does not know. This is juxtaposed with the deep spirituality and warmth of Mr. Ibrahim, a Muslim, and the boy gives up his Jewish identity to adopt a Muslim one. In today's world it is difficult not to read here more than a story about relationships."
5,Ridiculously underrated,"Presumably because this album had such a different sound from Borrowed Time and Lightning for the Nations, Canterbury has been panned over the years. But.... if you forget about the past, come to this record with an open mind and listen to it, you will be rewarded with a fantastic prog rock near masterpiece, all is missing is a truly epic track. There is maturity everywhere on this record that is missing from the first Diamond Head records. From the singing, to the guitar work, the music, the production, the time signatures and the lyrics, it's a crying shame a record like this can spell the end for a band. I wonder if things would have been different if they had started afresh and treated it as a new project at the time things could have turned out differently."
3,Good product - could be better,"The product could be better if the pillow case used to hold the Buckwheat hulls is more elastic, and a little less full. This will provide better contour for people with smaller neck/shoulder ridges."
5,Great replacement kit for stock radio!,"I don't know what exactly the problem the other reviewer had was. I had no problems with this product. It works great and includes everything you need to replace your stock radio(minus the aftermarket head unit). The only ""bracket(that the other reviewer mentioned)"" I can think of comes with all aftermarket radios. This product looks much better than I expected it to look in my dash. It is completely flush and looks like it could very easily be the stock setup.PROS:Flush, clean looksEasy to installComes with everything you need(just add aftermarket head unit and your ready to go!)CONS:None"
2,Depressing,I don't recommend this book for anyone in the adoption triad. It is very personal so I didn't find it especially relevant to my own situation.
4,Actually Pretty Darn Good,"The lusty, baudy, soap opera about an orphan and his many rises and falls along the pathway back to his true heritage is a pleasant exception to the many boring old books out there that bear the label ""literary classic""."
2,Clear Plastic Tablecloth,Disappointed by its thinness. But I have been using it for a month and haven't had a tear. Would prefer oilcloth.
2,To thin,"I bought this clear plastic tablecloth to cover my newly brought lace tablecloth, the plastic cover is far to thin for what I wanted it for. I will be buying a thicker plastic tablecloth in the furture."
2,things to know,"its thick/tough enough and does its job.only issues to think about is it comes folded and im not sure you can truly get the fold out (might be better to buy off a roll as i did before at a fabric store so there are no folds, was allot happier with a rolled one."
3,Not smooth as pictured,"Not nearly as thick as I had hoped. Hopelessly creased, even after hanging up for over a week. Definitely not nice and smooth as in picture. Strong enough to protect from spills. It would have been much nicer if mailed rolled onto a cardboard tube, like paper towels, eliminating a lot of the creases."
3,More like Medium duty,"I wouldn't call this table cover / protector 'Heavy Duty' - more like Medium duty.I was hoping for a thicker plastic, but I don't think they can make it thicker, and have it folded in a package like they do. (The creases are still visible after a month of it being laid out on the table)I like that the edges are sewn, it was a good price for what we received.WARNING - NOT HEAT RESISTANT! I put a hot cup of coffee on it, and it started to melt the plastic."
3,Simple and gets the job done.,"But it's got very defined creases and doesn't look nearly as smooth as in the picture. If I need a table cloth, I will use it, however I've opted to go without a table cloth just because of how ugly this is."
4,Great way to protect your tablecloths.,"Plastic is transparent and thick, durable and easy to clean. We've used it for catering and wipe it or wash it at the end of service and it's ready to go... it doesn't absorb stains or smells. Good product."
4,Keeps tablecloth protected from toddlers,"This clear tablecloth has worked out perfectly for protecting our cloth tablecloth when our toddler eats at the table. The thickness is just right; it's thin enough to drape over the edges of the table well and thick enough to protect the table from the cats' claws when they jump on it. It wipes clean easily, also sparing me from scrubbing food of the table surface when I used placemats. I only aired it out overnight to ""gas off"". It was fine the next day. The tablecloth does show the fold lines and it's a bit shiny. Those aren't issues for my purposes."
3,Good Selection,Good Selection!!!Price was not competitive.We have been using since Christmas and looks like it will go for next 6 months.
3,Islamorader,"I've heard better from her. This is very experimental. It has some really good songs, some OK and then some that make me think, what was she thinking?"
5,Tori has returned!,"Tori is a commodity no doubt, but a genius artist. Her previous two albums had her meandering towards mediocrity, if you ask me. This album rocks and is as creative as she's ever been and has her voice as strong as ever.She's back to writing songs AND music, with an energy and conviction not heard for awhile. Bouncing off clouds is gorgeous and emblematic of her return.The rest is classic and musically as adventurous as she has ever been.Tori rules once again!"
4,"Newer sound, much better than The Beekeeper","I have loved Tori for awhile now. I'm an Under the Pink lover, so this album has a different sound than some of her older albums, but keeping up with modern music. Still very good though, produced very well, and makes me forgive her mistake with ""The Beekeeper""."
3,Once you edit this album it becomes 5 STARS,23 tracks...Talk about needing an editor. Take out all the under 1 minute songs & a few of the boring in-between songs & what you have is one of Tori's best albums that flows wonderfully. I got the album to the 50 minute mark & its now awesome. One of her best albums.
3,Strange little Tori,"As a true Torist, I couldn't wait for ADP to come out. Sadly, it is only slightly above the horrendous Strange Little Girls concept album. Yes this album does have some really great songs on it. That said, ADP falls apart because it lacks a cohesive sound or direction. Yes, her concept was to channel 5 distinct female voices, but it just ruins the flow. Plus, there are several less than a minute ditties, which have great potential to be interesting full fledged songs, but they were never given a chance to grow. The songs that really shine for me include: You Can Bring Your Dog, Girl Disappearing, Smokey Joe, Code Red, and Mr. Bad Man. Big Wheel, Teenage Hustling and Body and Soul are great too but they don't gel with the rest of the album. Hopefully next go around Tori will give up on the complicated concept album and return to something that always works... just being Tori."
1,Pseudo Science,"At first this book looked very good indeed. Scientifically proven facts on psychology by clever authors. A new and updated test based on the newest knowlegde from all parts of America. I read about 80 pages and got really disappointed. Why? Because psychiatrists focus on stating a diagnosis, not giving practical advise. However, they do try to give you some idea, but these ones are thinner than the paper it has been printed on. Therefore I don't think that you will get any help from this book, which has more than 400 pages of nonsense. For specific problems, read specific books. The Personality Test in this book is a disaster. 107 strange questions and a very odd calculation method to diagnose your socalled type. Forget it."
4,Defiance by Brandon M. Moskos,"I pre-ordered this movie, and I was amazed on just how great this movie was. True story about ordinary jewish bothers who lead a group of jews to survive the holocaust. As they try to survive, they live in forests and often have to relocate because of attacks on them. They learn how to live in the forests and count on each other for survival. Daniel Craig was flawless as the main leader, who has disagreements with one of his brothers and other refugees, but always stays in control to get revenge on the germans, by surviving. This is a must-see. The only flaw in this movie was that I thought it was too long at almost 2 and a half hours."
3,Based on a true story,"I liked this movie. Based on a true story it has good acting, a good story, action and also some very moving moments. Liev and Daniel Craig are both excellent. Not a great movie but it is pretty darn good. Lots of violence so not for kids but I think both men and women would like it."
1,IGNORANCE IS BLISS .........,"TIME TO GET over all of this and move on.....yes, a somewhat satisfactory film about human greed, suffering, greed, suffering, greed and more suffering - nothing really noble.Better? 'THE VICTORS' - 'THE BRIGDE' - all about the foolishness of empty promises ....meaning nothing."
5,Defiance,"A true story, and very well done. Authentic in presentation. You get a true immersion into a forgotten or little known theatre of WW2. Liev Schreiber is amazing in this role."
5,Defiance,"This is an excellent movie with powerful performances by Daniel Craig and the entire cast. The movie is grim and based on true life incidents that occurred. I will not give away the plot but I will say that it has moments of sadness as Daniel Craig and his two brothers try to save innocent people from dying, however, a lot of those people land up dead. Despite the sadness, there is hope instilled in the movie, so one must watch it until the very end. Highly recommended! I enjoyed the movie a lot."
3,"Good movie, but a copycat I think","I got this movie because the actor who played James Bond is a good actor. Plus I enjoy WWII films. This one is pretty good although it does have a few gory scenes so beware. The story is probably the best part about this movie. It is very very similar to the movie Saints and Soldiers. Except this time it is civilians trying to escape from the Germans if I can't remember correctly. Either way if you don't mind a little gore, this movie is pretty good. There is one really violent scene in the movie which is the most disturbing when he goes and gets some paper from a guy's house so beware."
5,Great movie!,I am obsessed with anything related to the Holocaust. This story was so touching! All that perseverance in a hopeless time. Would recommend to any action movie lover.
5,a Turtledove classic,I am a Turtledove fan and bought this book to replace an old soft cover copy. Being a priss about my library I had no regrets other than that it took me so long to find a hard cover version is such good shape.
4,Howdy Ma'am....,"What a charming little book, Will may have been a cowboy out of his element but he was no man's buffoon. I really enjoyed the romantic struggle between Will and Olivia. The classic upstairs downstairs angst with a little twist. The hired thug Maddox was a hoot, reading Western dime novels to figure out how to fight Will and Pryce the stereotypical aristocrat that always get someone else to do their dirty work was a slimy character. SPOILER: I was glad the author did not have Will coming from a wealthy family and that Olivia got her title because her husband was a successful business man. The love scenes though not many were placed just right within the story, the author allowed Will & Olivia to develop their attraction to each other and made the reader as anxious for the deed to be done as the H/h. It was nice to read a book about the working class finding love for a change. I will definitely be reading more books by this author."
4,Les Mis,"""Who am I"" to review such spectacular music? ""I Dreamed a Dream""I had""One More Day"" to listen, but alas I am not ""Master of the House,"" and my wife turned it off; not because she didn't love it, but to get me to stop singing, Apparently she didn't want to""""Hear the People Sing."""
2,"The music is good, but the singing . . .","If you at all care about voices, I wouldn't buy this cd. Granted Micheal Ball's voice is good, but Eponine's voice is squeaky and whiny, Fantine sounds like a man, and don't even get me started on Colm Wilkinson . . . If you want to hear great singing and still want all the tragedy, go listen to Phantom (Original London Cast)."
2,"good material, bad singers","I love Les Mis, but not this recording. Javert (terance mann) butchered his own songs but was decent in the big numbers. Fantine was completely devoid of emotion and didn't make up for it in voice quality. frances ruffele had emotion but it is possible to convey emotion and sound good at the same time (ie koho shimada) colm wilkinson isn't my favorite but he's very good. marius was awefull. cossette (judy kuhn) was very good. the orchestra seemed to synthesized. I would recommend the complete symphonic recording. the extra money is worth it to get better performances and the Full show."
1,"The music was ok, the lyrics could use soap","I first heard some of the music to Les Miserables at a concert I recently went to, and I was so impressed that I bought the cd a few days later to hear the rest of the songs. As it turns out, the concert songs were edited...these were not. If you can excuse songs devoted entirely to conversations between prostitutes and their customers, frequent ""mild"" bad words, quite a few inappropriate references, and a complete disregard for God's name....then you'll probably like this cd. As to the music-well, there are a few songs that are pretty, and others that are ""inspiring"" (especially ""Look Down"" and ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"")and then there are some that consist entirely of nearly spoken words set awkwardly to music. I know I sound like I'm beating the cd up-I just don't want anyone else to spend $20+ on this cd just to find that its not really appropriate, and shelve it as I have done."
3,"Cmon get in & watch the people spin, oo-la-la Les Miserables","I definitely recommend the OLC recording over this. There's something about the British accents lending themselves so much better to the story line & vocals. Even the British chorus singing as one gives you a chill this US chorus cannot. The Broadway musical director forced Frances Ruffelle to eliminate her accent in her solos here, and it weakens her performance. Too bad they totally revamped the original ""I Saw Him Once/A Heart Full of Love"", which was lovely in the OLC. Randy Graff is much weaker than Patti Lupone was in the OLC - in this one, she sounds whiny. I do like this version of ""Turning"" better tho. The one good thing is that the diction is a bit better in this recording. And I even saw this exact cast live at the Kennedy Center in DC before its Broadway run. But I still recommend the OLC over this."
5,great used cd,"i purchased a used cd. i received it quickly, the case was in great shape. the cd itself sounded like it was brand new. it was a wonderful transaction"
2,Diane Carey Messed up This One!,"I read all six of the Double Helix books before reviewing this, and I still believe this is one of the worst yet! Basically Spock and Eric Stiles are the only character introduced in the first part. Now really, if you're going to write a book, at least include three or four characters. Plus, I found Eric Stiles annoying. I think Diane either rushed or didn't bother to actuallt contemplate about what she was writing. The content of this book almost makes it sound as though she was rushing through what could have been a great novel.If only Diane had enhanced the content and dialogue a little, it would have made a great book three, but instead, the content is sloppy, the plot is jumbled and at times hard to follow, the climax was a little sudden and forced, and the karate wife was a little much for me at the end. The ending was rushed. Diane Carey should have put a little more effort into this one!"
1,Watch us stretch! See FOUR drills. Listen to Thurman.,"This is the worst waste of money I have spent. I am a high school football and track coach (I played college ball and coached three years at that level). I was looking for some ideas (got NONE). I WOULD MAKE A BETTER VIDEO FOR PEOPLE TO LEARN FROM (you wouldn't have to WATCH my kids do the majority of the stretching routine either. That's right, you pay to watch kids stretch for about 8 minutes. The kids then do about FOUR drills. Then Thurman talks about how to set up in a stance, how to take a handoff (nothing new), how to run to the hole, and how to block (hold cloth). SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Maybe I am not entirely fair,"Maybe I am not fair (about the 1 star rating), because I did not read this book from cover to cover. Let's be fair: cadogan (or everyman) makes great books, including about the QGA. But this entire ""easy guide"" series is a little misguided. The back cover says: ""just enough detail and explanation to play an opening with confidence"". Not true. The book starts with typical QGA positions. I went trough them: they have practically nothing in common. Each chapter starts with some other positions, then the author gets to the ""theory"", which is absolutely not exhaustive. I am glad I did not buy the ""scheveningen"" easy guide as well. Conclusion: if u know how to play the QGA already, maybe there's something for you in this book. For the rest: find something with more meat."
2,Form over Function,"I bought this blender based on the reviews here, as well as its great-looking design. When I got the blender, only one of those factors came through.First thing I noticed: both blender jars leaked badly. After reseating the seal in the glass jar and tightening it as hard as possible, the leak was slightly reduced. The metal jar still poured out liquids from the base.Second thing I noticed: this blender cannot make a good smoothie. Even after a couple minutes of blending, there are chunks of ice and fruit which have been totally untouched by the blades (regardless of how little ice is put in the smoothie). For a blender of any price, the DeLonghi does a poor job making smoothies. For a blender that costs what the DeLonghi does, this performance is totally unjustifiable.But, hey, it does look really good."
2,Fragile Italian Design with far too many parts,"Like many say it has a nice design but functionally it is poor. The Glass Jar has 8 parts, the Steel Jar has 7 parts, and glass jar broke within 6 months of light use. I also second the fact that this unit is prone to leaking and as a professional chef I can tell you this is not worth the time or money as there are better products out there."
1,101 Reasons to Love the Yankees: And 10 reasons to hate the Red Sox,"This book, from this Yankee fan's perspective is a waste of time. Author could have done better with 25 reasons to love the Yanks, instead of digging and scratching for the additional 76. The 10 reasons to hate the Red Sox were even more lame. The book itself is very small - too small in size/scale. Go Yanks!"
2,Disappointing,"Perhaps I am being over-critical, but I cannot hide my disappointment in this release. Seeing that the track listing contained gems such as Cascade and Melt, I rushed home as fast as the wind would carry me... and put it on the stereo.I still have not got over the disappointment of this awful version of Melt (compared to Nocturne), in which they employ an absolutely sickening ""second voice"", uttering ""melt"" and "".. she says .. "". Kind of reminds me of the single version of Cocteau Twin's ""From the flagstones"", but that's another story.The versions of ""Cascade"" and ""Painted Bird"" are also very disappointing, esp. since ""Cascade"" is my favourite song off ""Nocturne"". Maybe these songs were just meant to be done live.As for the rest of the album, well, it just doesn't quite have the same haunting atmosphere of Siouxsie's real gems, such as ""Juju""."
3,Train reading - not much more.,Story truly strains reality; hope that our legal system and those working in it have more common sense than this presents.
3,Hard to put down...wish I had,"Bad. That's it, just empty. Vapid characters, a mystery man with no face should at least come to life with a scare tactic or tw. not a one Mr. Meltzer. This book came upon recommendation and now the recommender is not being shone in the brightest light. It WAS hard to put down though, but then again, so is a Twinkie."
4,Entertaining and a quick read,"I picked this book off my bookshelf after not finding the latest Clancy novel. After only a few pages, I was hooked and couldn't put it down.The dialogue was especially funny to me, a 29-year-old male. I loved Ober's crazy ideas (especially his Mexican restaurant name, Tequila Mockingbird) along with Ben and Lisa's mock bickering.Meltzer keeps you guessing and, at one point, my list of suspects was up to about six or seven. He played the whole story out extremely well. Even when you find out who Rick's inside source is, you didn't know the truth.I've read some of the other reviews and will say that everyone's entitled to their opinion. But, personally, I don't think it deserves all of the pans that it's getting. Meltzer's first attempt into the legal thriller genre exceeded my expectations and will get me to read his other novels.If you like crisp, funny dialogue between young 20-somethings, I strongly recommend you read this book."
4,Reminiscent of Grisham,I enjoyed this fast moving thriller. The protagonist was a sympathetic character. The plot was almost plausible. I look forward to future novels by this author.
1,Who Does Brad Meltzer Know at Warner Books?,"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. The dialogue was trite, the characters were shallow and one dimensional. The premise of the book seemed interesting but a writer of Meltzer's inexperience couldn't carry it off. Reading used to be the last refuge for those of us who are not interested in Melrose Place, 90210, or Party of Five. Save your money. If you really want to check this book out . . . check is out at the library and save the $7.00. Or better yet, I'll mail you my copy. It certainly won't be joining the shelves of my library."
1,"A pass! As a consuming public, are we realy this naive?","Finished the Tenth Justice and must say that I'm amazed this was ever published. Sophmoric dialogue, plot, storyline, and tone added up to a book that never even comes close to working. Save your money and your time and read something, anything, else. This is a real poor piece of writing and time. Hype, hype, and more hype.."
2,Not worth it,"How many times does ben say ""My career will be ruined"" in the first 50 pages? I quit counting. The premise of this book is very interesting and provides some good (and I assume realistic) insight into the life of a clerk for the Supremes but the book is overly long, the writing juvenile, and the characters ridiculously unlikeable (and stupid). I wish a better author would have taken on the premise"
2,PG-13 (and above),"Not since ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" have I been faced with so many characters of unredeeming value. The dialogue is simply juvenile and the plot is so ridiculous that I found myself laughing in places where I'm sure the author was trying to create suspense.Mr. Meltzer should read a few Elmore Leonard books to see how a top-notch writer forms dialogue between his characters. Beware of any book that People magazine recommends!"
1,Elective oral surgery would be more enjoyable,"the only good thing i can say about this book is that it had an ending. unfortunately, by the time i got to it, i was completely disgusted and couldn't care less. the characters were self righteous and underdeveloped and the plot was thinner than thin. give me a cookbook john grisham any day."
5,"Bored with Grisham?, Try Meltzer!!!","I found the tenth justice to be the book I was hoping for with every Grisham(and never got). This is the first book I've ever read where I felt the characters spoke as they would in real life. As a warning, it may not appeal to or seem real to readers who are out of touch with the twenty-somethings of today(my mom would not evern finish it). Its also the only book that mad me laugh out loud. For a GenXer A must read."
1,Laughable,"[...]This book is the antithesis of a masterpiece. It is pure bubble-gum, Hardy Boys, average to below-average writing. Meltzer has a bad habit of acknowledging many experts at the beginning of his novels, thereby giving the impression that his books are authoritative, behind-the-scenes, fact-filled gems. In reality, his dialogue is laughable, there are little or no facts throughout, and suspension of disbelief gets harder and harder as one progresses through the novel.This might be acceptable if the writing wasn't so amateurish across the board. Rapidly switching POV's, characters exchanging inane, expository dialogue, and screenplay-type prose with little or no description make for painful reading.The Library Journal said it best, that it would keep YA (Young Adult) audiences entertained. That's terrific. But please, please don't market it to the rest of us, the readers who loved the Hardy Boys but gave them up when we were 14.[...]"
1,BORRRRRINNG!,"I am student who will be attending law school this next year, so I try to keep up on any new books I find related to the subject of law. This book was just BAD. The writing was dull, the characters lacked development, and the details were overdone. I kept turning page after page, hoping it would get better, but didn't have any luck. I was relieved to finish it. Even my boring accounting textbooks are better reading material."
2,>.<,"Hello, my name is Ben. I am the dumbest Supreme Court clerk in history. I was duped into revealing confidential information. My bad! I have great friends and we say lots of funny stuff to each other. They help me try to fix my problem, but since I am The Dumbest Supreme Court Clerk In History things don't work out so well. Still, I end up with the girl, and I get my dream job as a federal prosecutor where common sense and brains are--apparently--not required."
3,"A very entertaining ""Book-Of-The-Week"" kind of read.","I love thrillers, mysteries. This book fulfilled that lust in me. However, too many passages consisted of the same scene, namely, the roommates telling each other to shut up. Was it only me, or did all the guys seem awfully gay? The living situation of the roommates seemed a bit too cozy as evidenced in their banter with one another. Liked Lisa. I could see that gal in NEWSRADIO play her in the movie version. And Ben? Thomas Gibson."
1,Such juvenile characters!,Ben was one of the most annoying characters and really stupid to have such a great educational background! Very hard to keep the characters straight and who Ben could trust!
2,Not very good...,"I've read two of Meltzer's other works, The First Counsel and The Book of Fate, and both were superbly written, with excellent crafted characters and intriguing storylines. I'm also a fan of his graphic novel Identity Crisis. I bought The Tenth Justice in e-book format and...wow, I really slogged through the first few chapters. The writing is juvenile. It reminds me of first time fanfic writers. Lots of ""Ben said."" ""Nathan replied."" I didn't realize this was Meltzer's first book when I bought it, so I was really confused that the quality was so, so, so down. I was wondering Meltzer had had a head injury or something. I doubt I'll be able to finish it. That's $6.99 down the tubes. Luckily, Mr. Meltzer improved his craft because the two afforemention novels of his are fantastic."
2,"An adolescent, fast paced unsatisfying story.","The story was an exciting one for a teenager that did not have have much understanding of the law. The story was to ""pat"". The pieces fit together like a very simple jigsaw puzzle that when complete did not have a satisfying picture. I recieved it as a gift and did not have the heart to say it was not a good read."
3,Ok,"This book ended up being good, it starts out really slow and took awhile to get into it though. But I know this was his first book and I am figuring that they do get better. I don't think you have to read them in order but personally I like to read books from the authors first one and so on. Just a little quirk. I will go on to the second book next."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!,I gave this book a try on the strength of the number of Amazon reviewers who gave this book a 10. (I thought those who gave it a 1 were simply being pretentious). Boy was I wrong! This book proves that you don't have to be a writer to get a book published. It gives hope to all who would like to write a book but have no talent.
2,Absolute Drivel - Ben and Our Gang!,"Ingnorance is truly bliss! As a recently retiredfederal law enforcement official I found thisbook to be terribly lacking of a solid technicalfoundation. I think the author has potential,however if one knows anything about howlaw enforcement and federal bureaucratsoperate, this was sad. Take away all ofthe unnecessary dialogue between thefriends and you have a book of about 100pages. A more appropriate title for thisbook should've been ""Ben and Our Gang."
3,Beach Version of John Grisham Lite,"Of course a novel of this sort takes you straight to a comparison with John Grisham novels. While Grisham pursues No character development this author tries to develop his character via fratty chatty talk and play between his characters which gets really annoying and waters down what could be a fun and engrossing read. If you are looking for a beach book and a little annoying writing won't bother you, buy this one. If you are looking for a thriller with a plot, this book only partially gets you there"
1,Camp Rock... doesn't rock. At all.,"Camp Rock was an immense disappointment. I went into it expecting something a la High School Musical (a personal favorite of mine). Unfortunately, this isn't even in the same universe as High School Musical. Demi Lovato, the main character, seems like a nice girl. Who can't act. And can barely sing. Miley Cyrus could've done far more with the role- and that's saying a lot. The story failed to capture my interest, and the songs... ugh. Unlistenable garbage. Hold out for High School Musical 3 and let Camp Rock pass by you. If we're lucky, maybe the sequel will be the less we'll ever hear of these less-than-rock-ers."
5,We love this movie,My whole family enjoys this movie. It is entertaining and cute. It was also very resonable compared to other stores.
1,Lids are ill-fitting,"We've had ORIGINAL Corning French White items for over 30 years and these have stood the test of time. These aren't those. This 'Corning' is actually just the purchased/leased trademark that World Kitchens is using (Jarden has done this with Sunbeam, etc, I believe) to ride on the coattails of the original Corning Glass Works quality reputation. These have the rubber/plastic covers, too, but the cover for the larger casserole is NOT sized properly to fit 'airtight' for effective containment. It is off measure by about 1/8th inch in the diameter - too big. This is also the same problem with the duplicate set I purchased. Also with the 7oz ramekin pair sold by Amazon, too. See that review, too. Not worth the money, unless you don't care about using the rubber/plastic covers. We're looking into Pyrex products for better satisfaction for our needs. Maybe Amazon should drop this company's products to avoid disappointing its customers?"
2,Pigeon DVD,Dont buy the DVD. I thought this would be a cute movie for my child but it contains so much yelling and screaming. Better recommended for children 6 and older who can understand when its appropriate to make so much noise.
2,Misleading Title,"Those looking for COLLOQUIAL Uzbek samples will be disappointed (like I was), since the material here is simply standard literary Uzbek recorded on tape in phrasebook format. No attempt is made to present features of spoken Uzbek, such as using one ending for both genitive and accusative, and pronouncing this as +ni, +di, or +ti depending on the final consonant. Even the second person plural pronoun ""sizlar"" (you all) is left out. The material also shows some Turkish influence, such as the use of a verb for ""to want"" (""baliq istaysizmi?"" ""shirinlik xohlaysizmi?"" are not spoken Uzbek). As usual with such material, the native speaker informant was content to translate the English phrases literally, with no concern for colloquial phraseology or usage. While a tourist traveling to Uzbekistan will find the material useful, I would not recommend it for someone wanting to learn spoken Uzbek."
1,Misleading title and description,"I clicked on a product titled ""EO - Chamomile & Honey Conditioner, 8 fl oz liquid"" but was taken to a page showing a photo of a LAVENDER conditioner instead of a chamomile and honey one. The product description says it contains chamomile and honey, but if you read the ingredients, the chamomile and honey are nowhere listed. And if you read the comments, it says that this product smells like Lavender. So it appears that the product description and ingredients do NOT match the actual product that is sold through this page."
1,not worth the price,this is the worst computer chair i ever purchsed it is hard and the arms are total garbage the back is springy and wont stay tight just awful highly unrecommended at any price and I paid way too much
3,Yes and No,"The demo was informative except that it uses an old version of Visual Studio and his screen was very small so he had to be constantly moving, opening, and closing windows. The transitions were annoying. There are pdf' of the lectures.When I copied the demo projects to my computer. None of them would run or even open in Visual Studio 2005 and none could be converted. The email address on the DVD is a dead link. I did a search and found his website. I sent him an email to ask what the problem was, which he ignored."
3,Adequate. It is what it is...,"This is not the best production and the presentation is, as another reviewer put it, ""City College"". But, it is what it is...an inexpensive DVD training course that exposes you to all the basics. Its exactly what I needed as an experienced VB developer to get into VB.NET database access.If you are shallow and cannot look past the presentation for the content provided then this DVD is not for you. If you can sift through the minor inconsistancies and meandering presentation style, which most of us do on a daily basis with users and business analysts, then snap this baby up.(...)"
3,makes mr ed look like glue,"the story is theres a talking horse willed to bobcat goldwaith.it talks!its also a genius about the stock market!and to make things that much better,he got half a broking firm in the will too.so his horse don,tells him where to put his money and he gets rich quick.of course this pisses everybody else off.bobcats in it.the kids think its funny.a funny part i liked was when they have to put don into a horse race and they need a jockey.one guy is being interviewed.bob says ""why should you be the one to ride don,mr snake?"" and he replies,""one shot of this and your horse could win indianapolis 500""!that was great!its one the only talking animal movies ive ever liked in my whole life!theres a bunch of psycho chicks in this one.no hotties.i like it better than the police academy movies."
2,A Good Start,"I am a begining Go player and have just finished this book. The first 30 or so pages comprise a solid introduction to the basics, but after that the book gets vague and difficult to follow. The directions for some of the practice problems were confusing.I understand that it is hard to write a slim volume on such a complex game, but I think some important intermediate steps were left out before the book started on more advanced material.It's cheap price makes it worth picking up if you aren't sure whether or not you will get into the game enough to make buying a more expensive book worthwhile."
2,A Great Performance . . . Poorly Produced.,"What you get here is an EXCELLENT performance by Anita O'Day, marred by poor production. The sound is muddy and tinny, and the songs are faded in and out. There is almost no between-song banter. (Additionally, although Anita is famous for singing at a break-neck pace, I'm not so sure that this recording insn't playing back a tad too fast. Her voice sounds especially unusual on a few of the tracks.) This one if for O'Day fanatics and completists only."
1,Be Warned: This Is *NOT* the Beulah You're Thinking Of...,"There's only one ""Beulah"", and that's the much-loved, much-adored, much-admired band from San Francisco! They fought it out for nearly ten years, putting out four full-lengths, tons of singles, played countless shows and even putting out a DVD in August!This person must change their name.May I suggest ""Wilco""?"
4,"good, for a live-thing","I've bought this CD with ""Tinderbox"". Well, I prefer ""Nocturne"".The older Banshees-stuff is more powerful (don't you think so,too?).O.K. before that I've listened to a horrible Live-album of Christian Death. It must have had some kind of influence..."
4,sweet tooth by ian mac ewan,"A novel approach to the intelligence world in England during the cold war , that involves writers or literature as the backbone of the story where love , treason and political interests mix ."
4,A Good Summer Reading book,Raymond Chandler takes us through Marlowe to where good and evil become virtually hard to tell. Marlowe goes beyond his usual work to the summertime getaway places of his time. Filled with twists and turns as well as the gritty dialog that I didn't expect from Chandler. The Lady in the Lake is a good book that delivers the mystery and what not he is known for. This has been my favorite summer reading book yet.
3,good but flawed,"... The book is a quick read, and the writing is smooth. I will read this author's next book. However, the relationship between Ana and her boyfriend Andrew is unbelievable. First, we are told that they have discussed living together, which suggests that they have at least been dating a few months, but they seem to have a total lack of understanding of each other. Andrew's character is not developed enough for the reader to figure out why he is treating Ana so badly. Ana, on the other hand, consistently behaves like a teenager -- she exhibits so little common sense or self-control in her dealings with Andrew that you doubt she could have passed FBI psychological tests. This incomprehensible relationship drives some very peculiar plot twists that untimately seem unbelievable to me. In the midst of all this, the main story of the serial rapist gets lost."
3,Not My Favorite,"This book wasn't awful, but it wasn't one of my favorites either for Megan Hart. Try ""The Road Taken"" by Megan Hart instead."
5,"Soothing, Sweet & Soulful....","Wow, Patrick Fitzsimmons has a really lovely voice and he has written some really wonderful songs on love, life, friendship and folly that are beautifully realized on this album. It's spare when appropriate and the piano, cello, violin and percussion jump in at all the right places. This is a thoughtful, soothing yet inspired album with real soft corners for hard times. Everyone should be listening to this album right now. If you like great acoustic folk rock with a hint of pop, this album is for you. You'll listen to it over and over because it just makes you feel so good. Favorites include ""Come to Me,"" ""Forgiving You,"" ""Peter's Garden,"" ""Two Birds,"" ""Beautiful Jane,"" ""Old Blue Heart,"" ""Fare Thee Well"" and ""Gimme' More Love."" But really, every song is fantastic. Frankly, the album is worth buying just for ""Gimme' More Love."" With sixteen additional songs that are equally outstanding....it's just more love..... Thanks, Patrick!"
1,Zero Woman-The Hunted,I never bought this DVD in the end due to some confusion on the seller part: merchant(ShopTech4Less) could not locate the outer insert for this DVD. I did get the refund though!
4,GREAT - At Least For A Covers Album,"As far as cover albums go, Through The Looking Glass is quite brilliant. If they had already proven that they could cover Beatles songs to sound as if it was actually their idea the whole time, the Banshees do it again in the span of an entire LP covering such disparate artists as Kraftwerk and Billie Holiday. While excellent covers, none of the tracks reach the dark and spectacular depths of the Banshees early work."
3,"JUST STARTING OUT "" I had to put a rating so I could post.""",I just bought this program a few weeks ago. I can't see a foot in front of my face with out my classes or contacts. So.. I'm going to do the 10 week program for weak vision. I will come back in about 8 weeks and let you know if I have seen any improvement. Wish Me Luck!!!!If you wish to e-mail me and check up on my progress in the mean time. (...)
3,Good for textbook,"First of all, this edited book is designed to bring together multi-displinary academic areas, not least business studies, economics and economic geography, which are interested in the dynamics of the firm. It is nice and well structured in terms of economics of the firm. However, from a viewpoint of an economic geographer, some of papers which talk about economic geography of the corporate organisation are too plain, old fashioned. Nevertheless, it is recommended that this book illustrates excellent combination of attempts to understand the firm as a container, seeker and creater of competence itself."
2,Don't waste your money,"This book contains information that you can get free in the internet. It outlines your rights for you, gives information about the credit bureau but that's about it. Most of the book does not even directly address credit repair but acquiring credit and keeping good credit--these are of course helpful but not if your immediate concern is credit repair. The only saving grace this book has is its discussion about credit repair companies but then again this information is also on the web. If you have a few hours and would like to save money go on the internet for free resources before buying this book."
4,It's good enough!,"I used the MCSE Test Success NetEss book as my only textbook to study for Microsoft's Networking Essentials exam. My only other resources were 2 practice exams from Transcender and my general computer/networking knowledge.This book did a pretty good job of preparing me for the exam. I passed on the first try, but not by much (I knew it would be close). I think the book probably doesn't explain enough to get every single exam question correct, but it explains enough to pass. And it does explain it well - without lots of extraneous information.I would recommend using this book to learn the material, but try to get some Transcender exams for practice testing - the format & nature of the Transcender exams are much more like the actual exam than those in the book."
4,"Italian So Fat, Low Fat, No Fat","I have just started making recipes from this cookbook and enjoy the good tastes and seasonings, especially the Eggplant Lasagne. I did have a problem with one recipe, Chocolate Budino, and wonder if there is a mistake and if the author, Beddy Rohde, or anyone else has a solution. The cake/pudding part of it turned out fine, but the topping never melted in the saucepan, and was very dry on top. It seemed to need more liquid than the 2 Tbsp. Amaretto. Other recipes I've tried have turned out great!"
5,"Not cutting-edge, but utterly essential!","Although (contrary to what some have said) Amazon does sell the latest (1985) edition of this book, it's still over 15 years out-of-date. That said, though, there's a deep wealth of practical boatbuilding advice here that can't be had elsewhere, and I'd recommend the book to anyone interested in wood-and-epoxy techniques. The chapter on lofting is also better than many entire books that have been written on the subject.The book also comes with a small addendum covering updates in the WEST System technologies (the latest I've seen is February 2001, although there may be newer), although it's only a few pages."
4,A fun book from the Dirk & Steele series,"As always, Marjorie M. Liu does not disapoint! The Dirk & Steele series of books have all been a fun ride from start to finsh."
4,Good plugs for motorcyclists,"I ride a motorcycle with a medium loud exhaust (about half the loudness of a Harley). These earplugs dampen the sound to just the right level where I can ride comfortably to the hum of my own bike while the sound of traffic is all but muted. They are comfortable (I wear them in 1-hour increments), easy to insert and come individually sealed 2 to a pack. 200 is a HUGE number and I don't know if I'll ever run out of these.If they didn't expand so quickly they would be perfect. I find myself rolling them between my fingers and then rushing to insert them before they expand. Other than that, no complaints.Update 05/04/10: Updated my review in response to a comment."
5,American made,This is a great product. I'm an avid hunter and often shoot at the gun range. These ear plugs are easy to use and cut down considerably on noise. I also like to use these ear plugs to help get some extra sleep from time to time. The best part about this product is that these ear plugs are made right here in the great USA!
2,Whole Lotta tiny spungy thingies...,"Yes, well, they arrived and OK, there were 200 of these, but they are WAY samll. Almost get lost inside my ear canal they did! Tiny when compared to other brands. These also work their way out of the ear shortly after you place them there. Do yourself a favor and get some that have more substance to them..."
4,Pat who?,"After becoming an die-hard Pat Metheny fan with my first hearing of ""As Fall Wichita Falls..."" I eagerly awaited each new release. With his first solo release Lyle proves to be Pat's compositional equal rather than side-man. An easily accessible album of sweeping atmospheric beauty and power."
5,Lyle Mays - Pat Metheny's best kept secret..?,"Well, what can I say that hasn't been already said about this monumental album and its musical genius creator, amongst these 5star reviews? Definitely one of my first choice Desert Island Discs! This album never loses its aura - is one of the very few I have, that is totally happy to live in my car cd player on repeat for days on end.. It also fair to compliment the supporting musicians on it as well: they make a valuable contribution to its flawess nature. In my collection one other album that shares a similar status is Lyle & Pat's 'The Road to You', and I can probably count the rest on one hand.. In gratitude."
4,sturdy and effective,"With a quart jar, the chickens knock it over occasionally, but not often. Threads must be kept clean and held perfectly level to screw back in. If you have less than 6 chickens, this will feed them all day. More than 6, you will need to refill."
3,Good Film,"I must admit that I ordered this film because of the star. I fell in love with ""Lance"" (Payne)on the Cosby Show and really got into him with ""New Jack City"" and ""Jason's Lyric"". I really enjoyed this movie and although the story was rather run of the mill, I must admit that ""the eyecandy"" kept me there. I've watched it many times and it has grown on me. Girls, beleive me, you have to see the ""fine brothers"" in this one. But then, I think the women will really enjoy it."
3,Decent material,"I watched the movie a few times. I'm into that black cinema. The movie was ok, could have been better. It had some fake looking scenes especially with the shooting scenes. Some of the acting was kind of lame. Allen Payne was the star of the movie. And he was also in New Jack City. Watching him act in this movie just convinced me that he probably felt he should have been the Nino Brown of New Jack, but yet, placed in a low budget type of movie. So honestly, it's not really a wonder why this movie went straight to video and never hit the big screen. It's worth the watch because again it's pretty good. I would recommend this movie for all those gangster type of movie goers"
5,Entertaining,"I watch it with family and friends ,we laughed and there is truth in humor it brought back alot of memories. Pat Cooper is great!"
4,I was so touched by this documentary film.,"The ""Soul Masters"" movie opens you up to the experience of soul healing. Everyone and everything has a soul. The beauty of this film lies in the journey that one takes in their understanding of their soul. This is where healing begins. Dr. Sha and Dr. Guo have made tremendous contributions and continue to do so for people and for mother earth. It is time to witness and receive their teachings and blessings to further move you on your spiritual journey. If you have any questions about this film, teachings, healing or about the two masters please e-mail me.Carmen Chu divinesoulhealer@yahoo.com"
5,From Emptiness with Love,"Soul Masters: Dr. Guo & Dr. Sha (2008)This heart touching movie shows you the most essential feature needed in healing. Only through the way of ""heart touch heart"", as demonstrated by these two Soul Masters, can Divine Healing Love be channelled unobstructed. You can witness yourselves how Love can restore Balance and Harmony in every issue and heal the most incurable disease.Master Guo generously shared his key healing secret of how within Space and Emptiness all the imbalances can easily be Transformed back to Balance and Harmony. This is why he called his art Gong Jian Yi Xue or literally Empty Space Medicine. In the West, it is translated into Body Space Medicine, which is also the title of his English book."
4,"Love the Beatles, XTC and Britpop? You'll love this!","if you like britpop, the beatles and/or xtc, this is a clever and fun collection of the entire Dukes library, the alter ego of XTC, in homage to the Beatles.some of the tunes are just so well done, and the hooks so well crafted that you'll find this is an enjoyable revisit, year after year. you are unlikely to sell this one used.just simply fun, and much more creative and loyal to the sound of the Beatles than anyone else has done."
4,Psuedo Psychedellia,"The XTC Alter ego takes an exploration of the era of psychedellic music of the sixties. Much of the sounds heard especially the later tracks smack of the Beatles, Byrds and oddly enough The Beach Boys (Pale and Precious). Overall a lot of fun with the interruptions of narration which sneak past the listener before or after each track. Personal favorites: Vanishing Girl, Little Lighthouse, You're My Drug, Have You Seen Jackie? It's a shame they haven't produced another since this one."
4,"Not Quite The Beatles or Pink Floyd, but....","The record starts off with a cheezy tribute to Pink Floyd, that I think is worthy of Spinal Tap. I still don't know if this was serious, or tongue-in-cheek. While this album will never be my favorite, I am liking it more with each play. ""Vanishing Girl"" is the one tune that really stands out. If you are new to XTC, I would hold off on buying this CD and go for ""English Settlement"" or ""Skylarking""."
3,Corman Cranks 'Em Out!,"CREATURE FROM HAUNTED SEA isn't so bad when you consider that Roger Corman made it along with two other movies (The Last Woman On Earth, and Battle Of Blood Island) almost simultaneously in Puerta Rico! The casts are interchanchable. The storylines of the three couldn't be any more different from each other! CFHS is a silly, semi-interesting spy / monster flick with what resembles a pop-eyed, rubber-gloved christmas tree as the monster! Need I say more? I like it enough to watch it every once in a while. Check it out..."
5,interesting,This book has very interesting study material. It teaches the key concepts in easy steps. The varied topics and structure of questions make learning fun (especially the age related topics) and teaching easier.My son could not wait to read all the passages.
2,quite functional when new; too bad its cheap plastic parts don't last,"This product was great for about 2 or 3 years. The bin is so handy to store outdoor items. However, the reel on which the hose winds cracked, the analogy would be an axle breaking, and now it is totally useless for storing the hose.When you pay this much for something, it should last a long time, and this didn't.To the extent it makes any difference, I used it with a 100' flexogen hose."
4,Suncast hose reel,This is a direct replacement for the previus one I had for about 10 years. The handle is up higher than some other models making it easier to wind. The top storage is very handy also. Great to see that it's still Made in USA!
2,Handle broke twice,"Beware the handles on these reels. They break easily, and are very difficult to replace, even though the parts are available. The handle is very poorly designed to handle the amount of torque that it transmits."
4,handy product,I have purchased several of these both for my use and as gifts. Nice features. Avoid trying to reel in a long section of hose without helping it a little by pulling the hose closer to the winder. Excessive force on the handle can break the reel.
2,Good idea- poor quality,"We bought one of these and a similar one by Ames. This one broke and the Ames is going on 5 years old with no problems. Unfortunately, the TruTemper Company (Ames) has decided to discontinue the version of their hose reel like this with storage in top. I don't want to waste money on another sub-par Suncast but I really want the storage. I think I'm going to have to go with the 2nd choice of Ames without the storage.One key annoying thing about Suncast in addition to poor quality: the handle is static and doesn't spin when you wind the hose up. The Ames brand has a handle that spins while you turn it rolling up the hose. This makes it MUCH easier to wind the hose without constantly having to shift your hand position."
3,A decent summer read!,"After all the excitement that I had heard about this book, I was a bit disappointed. The book was a good read but not great. I enjoyed the relationship between Charlie and Bryan more than I did between Charlie and Lily. If you do miss reading this book this summer - just catch it another time."
2,Iffie hair,It was far to light on my hair it didn't look like what it said it would and after it faded to pink within two days of hardly washing it
2,Boring,I know this is supposed to be for people with pelvic pain (which I have) but it was a little too simple for me. I had high hopes but maybe I will like it more if I get worse. Let's hope that never happens.
3,.......hmmmmm,I wasn't paying attention and order this book thinking it was a newer version. I thought I was getting the book that had this cover but didn't notice that the description was an older version. As a student I thought it was the most up to date version and had pictures. I should have looked at the find print that it was an older edition. However it did arrive quickly and was in perfect condition. I was studying the kidney at the time so it had the info I needed. And the company was very professonal
1,Not my Favorite Klavan...,"As a current fan of Klavan, I decided to take a look at some of his earlier works. Big mistake. This book is notable only for demonstrating how much the author has improved since writing this novel. I notice there are several good reviews here, so I recommend reading the first few chapters of the book before committing. I put this book down several times with no intention of finishing. I managed to finish the book by reading only the first sentence of every paragraph and felt I missed nothing. Lots of filler, it would have made a good half hour Twilight Zone episode."
1,Don't waste time with this.,"Unfortunately, I bought into the advertising and read this book. What a tremendous waste of time for the reader. The characters are not to be believed, the writing is stilted and the story is limp. I am surprised that this book ever made it to print. In some respects, this book gives hope to struggling writers who can probably get anything in to print."
2,too much bad language,"Not only was it so confusing and not scary, reading bad words is not my kind of book. Also, I was insulted when one of the mental patients told Nancy to send the jews to the moon. Didn't care to finish it. I won't read any more books by the author."
5,home improvement season 4,I love home improvement. i watch it all the time. i just bought the whole series for my room mate and we watch it all the time. That and friends!!!
4,volume is too loud and can not be tune lower,"Not bad, but the volume is too loud and a bit bulky, would help if it can chime/"
3,Great playing but recording is a bit weak,"The Rodrigo Collection is a compilation of Rodrigo guitar concerti recordings from 1975 to 1979. The guitar playing is robust, aggressive and macho, but not nearly as sensitive and deep as efforts by Pepe and Angel during the last decade. Twenty some years of practice and performing makes a big difference!Although the recording quality is decent, it is not nearly as full bodied as modern digital recordings by the Romero brothers. The midrange is thin and slightly bright and stereo imaging flat. It's not a great digitalization and remix of an analog recording. Lastly, the ""Shadows and Light DVD"" transfer from analog tape to DVD is terrible. If I didn't know I had put a DVD in the player I'd swear it was an old low rez video tape. Despite these warts, it's a must have for any diehard Rodrigo or Romero fan."
5,Basso Profundo!,"Even with more recent excellent efforts by Samuel Ramey, Norman Treigle still sets the standard for ""Mefisofele"" (as well as many other bass roles). This is an outstanding recording highlighting one of the best Basso voices of all time (Treigle) and one of the best Tenor talents of our era (Domingo). Not an overly familiar opera in the standard canon, but an extraordinary performance all around! As a fellow basso and opera lover, I am in awe of the talent of Treigle. His death was a tragic loss for us all."
5,y&t ten my personal review.,Once again another hard rock'in album from a hard rock'in band. Y&t ten deliver's a variety of flavor's to sooth the heavy metal palette.
5,great,"another great album from y&t . Amazing power combined with acoustical magic with the albums title track ,also some bluesy sounds and amazing vocal of meniketti.Do not miss this one a real pure hard rock album"
2,Typical American metal from 1990,"Y&T's ""Ten"" is not a great album, except for the song ""Don't be afraid of the dark"". Most of the time it sounds like you expect it to sound -bare in mind that this album was released back in 1990. There's a certain amount of a ""Whooa whoa-feeling"" comparable to bands like Warrant and their cheer leader rock. Although I think Y&T have released a couple of masterpieces (""Black tiger"" and ""Mean streak""), I have never considered Dave Meniketti to be a great singer. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that Meniketti often sounds strained and at times you might wonder if this guy is taking a dump while he's singing. Dedicated fans of Y&T will of course disagree and that's alright because we all have the right to our own opinion."
3,Wear glasses? You may want to read this...,"Spending a lot of time writing reviews is not my first priority, but sometimes I am compelled to share. In the great world of design, it seems that left-handed people and people who wear eyeglasses are forgotten. Are all engineers and designers right-handed 20/20 vision folks? These earmuffs reduce noise as advertised, but wearing them with glasses is uncomfortable. There are dozens of choices on Amazon, so if you wear glasses, keep looking. And if you find something comfortable, post a review. All of us with less than 20/20 eyesight will thank you."
5,A delightful read - bedside book,"This witty, light, thoughtful and altogether delightful read has a permanent place at my bedside. You can read the book straight through, open it up and read it starting anywhere.This versatile book could pair well with:- A Naturalist Buys An Old Farm- The Feast Nearby- Bailey White's books- Wesley the Owl- A Homemade Life- Wild Places by MacFarlane- James Thurber's books"
2,All that is solid melts into air,"'It was encouraging to discover that there were still quite a few people.. who preferred a feeling of high, breezy insecurity [on the Ferris wheel] to one of solid support.' My feelings go all the other way"
5,Excellent,Truffaut's always been a favourite director of mine so it's especially interesting to read his take on other peoples' films.
3,Fascinating glimpse into the Lindbergh's personal lives,"Through Reeve's gifted writing, readers get to know what it was like to be part of the Lindbergh family. At last, we find out what has happened to the Lindbergh's since the kidnapping. Reeve described a bedside visit to her dying grandmother, when her father ""administered communion to three generations (grandmother, Charles, Reeve) with malted milk tablets."" Anecdotes such as this, plus an honest recollection of childhood years, make Under A Wing a good read."
5,She inherited the writing gene!,Reeve Lindbergh gives a most interesting overview of her very famous parents - her father with his eccentric behavior - her mother with her focus on life through the eyes of a true poet. Her parents would be proud of her writing skills and her father would probably have given her rare praise for this particular book as well as her others. Kathleen Wyatt
1,Not Impressed,"Truly, this is a terrible movie.As lower-budget, artsy movies go, and I am a big fan of them, this is the worst one I have seen. This is an age old message in a time when I would hope that the young & restless in Hollywood are getting to be a little smarter.There were parts of this movie that seemed not to belong and made no sense. Women are shown being verbally abused and basically made to look like complete doormats. Also, if the storyline was trying to shed any light on interracial relationships, they were left in the dark.Going on reviews from this board, I was expecting an emotionally charged movie with strong acting.I was sadly disappointed."
4,a solid urban drama,"A gritty story such as this needs amazing actors and actresses to pull it off. And despite a pretty much no name cast, they certainly do. TJ Storm was fantastic as Melique (a bit underutilized perhaps). Tracey Stone is also very compelling as Claire. And hopefully people won't overlook Scottie Tate, who was simply outstanding and genuinely funny.I could have done without the timecode credits, which greatly distracted me from the first scene. Also I didn't particularly care for the picture in picture editting (think PhoneBooth with Colin Farrell). The dialogue also got very heavy handed at times.Still this is a very compelling movie which sets it apart from the average cookie cutter flick."
3,No sterling silver marking directly on the pendant,"As far as I can see, there is no sterling silver marking of any sort on this pendant. I don't see an ""S"" or circled ""S"" or a ""925"" or anything like that. It would be tricky to put the marking on but this could have been perhaps been done on the bale or else on the sides in the scrolling somewhere.I am not implying that the pendant is not sterling silver as represented. But if it's important that your jewelry pieces be individually marked, this pendant may not be for you. There was a tiny Sterling Silver paper tag that came with the pendant though.I will pull this review or revise it in the event that someone can point out where exactly the marking is on this pendant. With a magnifying glass, I was unable to see it anywhere. I did not test the metal with any of the metal testing kits out there."
5,A quirky book that's lots of fun,"Great little book for those curious about the strange and odd twists and turns the English language takes when used in everyday life. Mr. Elster reveals the origin of many of the phrases used in modern conversation and relentlessly criticizes those people in our society who, in an egotistical attempt to coin a phrase, butcher the English language.Fun book."
3,What happened to the author of Only Forward?,"First let me say that I am a huge fan of Michael Marshall Smith. I thought that Only Forward was the greatest read of the twentieth century. It is unfortunate, however, that his latest novel, One of Us, fails to achieve the transcending greatness of his first two novels. Mr. Smith continues to beat the ""not so distant future"" horse to death, and unlike the brilliant (almost poetic) vision of this future in Only Forward, One of Us seem to be grasping for a definitve vision that just isn't there. Frankly, I found the last half of the novel difficult to read. It tries so hard to be a complex, moral thriller that it loses it's sense of a tight, well concieved plot. Please, please, please, Mr. Smith try breaking some new ground. Your talent is too great to be wasted on novels like One of Us."
3,A bit too imaginitive to believe,"I must be getting more critical as I get older, but in ""One Of Us"" MMSmith has taken liberties that I can't comprehend or forgive.I did thoroughly enjoy his main character, Hap (actually hapless in this tale) Thompson, his friends and associates, and I found the language and style most engaging.I was put off by the walking talking alarm clock at the start of the book (not unlike Jimminy Cricket in another familiar fantasy), and found the concluding attack of the appliances to be much too great a stretch. I also felt Smith's exposition on the nature of God and the angels to be overdrawn and yet another grasp for a way out of an interesting but failed plot.Mind you, I did like the writing enough to just order 2 more of Smith's earlier and highly praised works, but I'd recommend letting this sleeping dog lie."
5,Sweet Tunes,"Our daughter (age 2) loves to hear Teddy sing. Night after night, his sweet voice helps her fall asleep. I highly recommend this package. I wish there were more tapes of Teddy singing!"
3,"A ""B"" for Ryan","I actually think this is an excellent album, but I'm knocking it down a couple of pegs because Adams was such a jackass when we saw him in concert a few months ago. I was really looking forward to the show, and paid good money for the tickets, and was enjoying the music - until Adams completely flicked out because some people were talking during one of his songs - finally he just cursed everybody and stormed off the stage. It's probably too late to ask for my money back... but suffice it to say the whole evening was an incredible disappointment. At risk of stating the obvious, a great performer should be able to captivate the audience - rather than trying to bully them into compliance."
3,1 too many for 2005,"When I first heard that Ryan Adams was going to put out 3 albums in 2005 I thought ""How's he going to manage that?"" With 29 I now know. Three was just too many. He stretched himself too thin. As if to support this theory, he didn't release another album until June 2007. Cold Roses was good. Jacksonville City Nights was pretty good. 29 falls short. He does some interesting things musically on the album. He take a couple of songs in a more blues direction and one is almost mariachi but the creativity isn't enough to carry the album. Lyrically, it's a very average effort. I'm hoping the 18 months between 29 and Easy Tiger will do good things for the next album."
5,Stan's Masterpiece,"Hardcore fans of Stan Ridgway (all 6 of us) may disagree, but I find this to be at once Stan's most accessible, and also his best album. After the promise of ""Call of the West"" (his last hurrah with Wall of Voodoo), and ""The Big Heat"" Stan created his most beautifully melodic album, with ""Mosquitos"". Stan's songwriting has remained strong over the course of his entire obscure career, but here he simply seems to have found the right musical mix to complement his songwriting. His modest use of synths, harmonica, and yes, even trombones, is inspired, if not typical Stan. I disagree that this album is quintessentially 1980s - it is quintessentially ageless. There are no weak songs on this album - mainly because, finally, Stan's musical talent matched his storytelling mojo.""The Big Heat"" got me interested, and ""Mosquitos"" sealed the deal. No matter what Stan does from now on (and I hear ""Blacktop"" is great), he will always have this masterpiece under his belt."
4,One of the best singing storytellers!,"Stan Ridgeway has a way of telling short stories in song. I believe this was his first solo album after being with Wall of Voodoo for umpteen years.The song ""Southbound"" was very popular on LA's KROQ radio when it was released.If you like Stan Ridgeway's unique music, this is a must have."
3,Not really contemporary,"although it is always good to learn something new , i was dissapointed when i discovered that all the rhythms were from the 80's and older"
2,Poor Quality,"I loved this watch when I first recieved it but I have quite a collection and don't wear any one watch often. Bought this one in July 2012, it is now January 2013 and I've only worn it 3 times. On the 3rd wearing the band came loose from the face and at this point I can only get a partial refund. NOT COOL!! I have one other Skagen that I purchased at the same time (a browm dial) and now I'm almost afraid to wear that one. Like this one, it is thin and nice to look at. I will not even consider another Skagen in the future. Looks and feels like quality, but NOT!"
2,Somewhat Useful,If you have a job in configuration management and start looking for books on SourceSafe you will find this is the only one. The book has some useful information but it becomes obvious that the publisher does not employ technical editors. There are several aside story sections in this book that could have been handled to help the user learn more but instead came across as the writers frustration with project management or cynical humor. Had any editor looked at these asides they surely would have edited them or removed them entirely. The publisher QUE used to be a producer of semi good technical books but WROX has passed them by in a big way. Hopefully Wrox will look at this product as viable to produce a book on but until then this is all there is.
2,Was hoping for more in-depth information regarding SourceSaf,I was looking for a book to help to programatically integrate SourceSafe with Microsoft apps. ie. VB. This book is essentially a book that tells you you need to use source safe on a large web development project. Not what I needed.
4,Two Minor Quibbles,"I have to agree wholeheartedly with all the glowing reviews this book has garnered. This is a quick, fun read, and it left me wanting to learn more. But two things keep me from giving five stars:1. Several times the author mentions the strictness of the Dutch Oven competition. Although she delves into similar contests, I would've liked to have read her take on this unique cookoff.2. This book cries out for pictures! I would love to see what some of these memorable characters look like. Even identifying the people depicted on the jacket would've satisfied my curiosity somewhat."
3,Good but not great,This book has some wonderful photographs and some good content but I was looking for a book that helped me become a better hunter and this book didn't do that. I did learn some things but it was very general. I also purchased the Grouse Hunter's Guide by Walrod and it was fabulous.
5,Hanoi does ROCK,"This album Rocks. This is the one to get. Ive been listening to this album since around 1985 and it rocks. The drummer of the band ""Razzle"" was the guy that was with Vince Neil who got killed in the DUI accident. Anyway ive listened to their other albums but this one is the best. If I had to pick 10 records (cd's) to be on an island by myself forever This one would be highly concidered as one of them. Thats how I rate my music."
1,Couldn't Convert and Use,"After downloading, I tried to convert it to Kindle but didn't have the right conversion product. I would like feedback as to help on doing a download."
3,Enjoyable but I wasnt sucked in.,"I cant complain a lot since this was a free book, and I did enjoy the story overall, but it was just really hard for me to get into this book. I normally read a book in one sitting and this one I had to put down a lot. I love to get lost in the book and this one never sucked me in. Perhaps it was that the main male character was a worker for the lead female's family and it was hard to connect to him. I loved the leading lady she was quirky and fun and one of the main reasons I pushed through and finished the book. Reading the book did cause me to do some research on the Earthquake of 1906 and I found some interesting first hand accounts that I enjoyed reading as much as the book.Again the book was free and I am not sorry I read it. I just wish I could have connected with it more."
5,"The best stand on Amazon, at the best price!","I've bought quite a few guitar stands off of Amazon in the past few years, and I've paid for the most expensive ones and the cheapest ones, and this is the best one I've found yet. Very sturdy, well made, and fully height adjustable, with strong soft foam to protect your precious guitars from getting all scratched up. It states that cellulose finishes can be damaged, so at least it lets you know that ahead of time(most cheap stands don't), so that's a good thing as well. Don't waste more money than you have to for a good quality stand, grab this one!"
5,Don't know what people have against this,"This is a great stand. I don't know why people would give it lower than a 5 star. It is rubber, it lasts long, its durable, its everything that you would want for your electric guitar. Definitely buy it"
4,Great stand for a great price,"This stand is sturdy and simple to use. It holds my bass very well - I'm not afraid of the stand falling over, even when sitting on carpet.The only reason I did not give it five stars is because the angle of the bottom bracket is a little odd for me. It works fine, but I wish it wasn't quite as steep as it is. With that said, I would still buy another one."
3,"Nice stand, but...","This seems like a nice product, but maybe I'm doing something wrong. I can't get the bottom guitar support to lock in place. It twists around and that makes it a little hard to put the guitar in place. Maybe there is something I need to do differently?"
4,4.3 Defining CD,"Warrior Soul took some by storm (unfortunately not many). I love the slick production and the first 2 trax (Ruins, We cry out) set the stage for a solid release. My personal favorite is ""In Conclusion"". These guys could have been bigger with a label that knew how to promote their kind of music. Unfortunately that never happened. But if you are smart enough to read this, and got yourself to even look at Warrior Souls stuff, then you must HAVE this!"
5,This is THE ONE!!!,This is one of the best albums ever recorded. Any band should want to KILL to write 1 song in their whole career as good as any on this album. It is a true crime that this band never got recognition that they richly deserve.
1,Leave The Mastering To The Pros,"I actually picked this CD up a year or more ago, and after relistening to the horrible mess made of Lullaby, it's no wonder why I had forgotten about it.All the power and feeling of one of my favorite ballads was wiped out by someone who thinks using hard limiting coupled with lots of clipping makes great music.Many people, self included, usually think about guitarists when the subject of metal comes up. However, when I first heard Warrior Soul, it was the drum work that caught my attention. Unlike most metal of the time, Warrior Soul's drum tracks had a raw powerful sound. This remaster turned great drum work to mush.I have a copy of this on vinyl and when I get around to buying a new turntable, I'm going to make my own CD transfer from the LP. Incidentally, My LP doesn't have ""Four More Years"" on it. In it's place is a song called ""One Minute Year."""
5,Great Tool With Great Price,"We purchased the Hardcore Pneumatic 2 in 1 Flooring Cleat Nailer/StaplerHardwood Flooring 1 1/2 inch to 2- inch. This is the best tool for the job, it operates smoothly, no hang ups and the price is unbelievable. The storage case is great, when the job is done the case comes in handy. We just finished installing about 1500 sq. ft. of 3/4 inch x 3 1/2 inch Bruce prefinished from Home Depot and this tool did an excellent job. We did buy our nails from Home Depot and they worked really well in this nailer. The shipping is outrageous, but you will receive it with about 2-3 days. We read the reviews before purchasing this and it greatly helped us make a decision to buy and we would highly recommend this tool to anyone.Baird's in Virginia"
5,Great heater,I like the heater. It is completely silent and puts out a good amount of heat. It is a very good value... Highly recommended.
1,Im still cold!!,"I agree, this heater ssssllloowwwly warms the room.I'm still sitting here freezing my buns off!!"
4,"great price, low profile heater","I ordered two heaters ( one for me at my condo, the other for my girlfriend at hers) and now in mid February, I've turned OFF my furnace and can heat comfortably with this unit. Now, I am on the 2nd floor of a three story building, so above and below I am ""insulated"" by my neighbors.My idea is to cut my heating bill by ten percent or more, because my money feels better in my pocket than in the energy company's pockets! Will let you know in a month or so if this has significantly helped. Also, shipping from Polstein's was very acceptable. (received order on Valentine's Day)Sincerely,TIMMERWinter 2008 is just around the corner! This low profile heater had already paid for itself last year, and with the slow economy, both of our condominiums will certainly have lower heating bills this year with this great product. As I stated at purchase, my money feels better in my pocket and this heater will surely help."
5,Good product,"I love it, it is quiet and the right size for me. I spent $70 on the HZ-515 and don't know if I would want to spend much more. I use about $5 dollars a day in electric powering 2 of these guys along with everything else in my apartment (cost per kilowatt hour is $0.165). Once they get a room up to temp it keeps it warm and toasty. I have one heating 250 sq ft room and I leave to doors open, so I heat about 600 sq ft with both HZ-515's. The average temp is about 45F I think if it gets much colder the HZ-515's will not be able to heat the area well and I will have to get an added heat source."
2,Wish I had taken notice of dimensions before ordering,"Wish I had taken notice of dimensions before ordering as this heater takes up quite a bit of room. The heat it puts out is moderate, probably would be ok for a small room. If I had to do it again I would order the HZ-519 instead even though more expensive it has better reviews."
1,The not-so-good SM movie,"This one is pretty worthless. All the other videos had the milestones of the show on them. In ""A Moon Star is Born"" the first part is obvious, Sailor Moon appears! In the next part she gets the disguise pen. In ""Scouts Unite"" Mercury and Mars appear. In ""Jupiter and Venus Arrive"", well, the name speaks for itself. In ""Day of Destiny"" we finally find out what SM is really about, and conclude the first seasone. But ""Evil Eyes"" is pretty worthless. The first part is about a cruise ship that drains people's power, and the second is about a wacko who traps people in pictures from a camera. Nothing new here, huh? They should of only published the five of them, you can kiss this one good bye END"
1,Well...,"most people who like sailor moon wouldnt recommend this one. Try VKLL fansubbers (go to a search engine and type in ""VKLL"") and see the REAL version. DiC dubbing isnt that great, but be thankful they dubbed it at all. I wouldnt even know of sailor moon if it wasnt for them! But this isnt the best video. I would only recommend this to little kids. If you are a true sailor moon fan, see the sub."
2,Why these episodes?,Why they chose these two episodes to put on a video I cannot understand. Cruise Blues and Shutterbugged are just filler episodes that were created to fill the ammount of episodes needed for the first season. The other videos available are better and more plot heavy than this one. I'm not even going to mention why it is stupid for the Wiseman/Death Phantom to be on the cover... He didn't even appear til the 17 newly dubbed episodes of Sailor Moon R...
4,"Creative, Fun Ideas!",We like the last part of the book when the kids got in trouble! We like when they wrote the letters. We think this is a great idea for kids who hate school!We like how Bastian and Christopher act! Bastian can be mean sometimes. Christopher's facts and opinions were really funny!

4,St. Gerard Gr. 6-Liked it!,"I read Flying Solo aloud to my 6th grade class. They had previously heard Someone is Hiding on Alcatraz Island. Flying Solo doesn't have the mystery of Alcatraz Island, but it deals with other important issues for 6th graders today. One student thought it was ""neat"" to hear the story through the various characters' point of view. I had them write a letter to me when we finished. They were to tell me their opinion and they were to answer the question: Have you ever mistreated a student in this class? They were very honest. I loved it. My class didn't feel they could ever""fly solo."" (They're right next door to the school office.) Enjoy this book. We did!"
2,Narrator is horrid,"I have to agree, this narrator, is not very good. First, the breathing, the saliva.... and the fact that it lulls you to sleep."
2,It's just as bad as all the other spreaders of this type,"This thing is just as bad as all the other cheap hand-held spreaders. I read the reviews of all the spreaders on Amazon and this was the best, but it has the same issues they all do: it clogs almost constantly, the mechanics are made of plastic so you cant force the clog through, you can feel all the plastic inside bending if you use too much force. You just have to walk around like an idiot moving the handle back and forth shaking it hoping its doing a decent spread."
2,cheap and doesn't work well,"This is not a well made spreader and the design is flawed also. I used it one time and it got clogged and jammed. I had to take it appart, clean it, and finally modify it to make it work right. This is cheap junk. Luckily I'm kind of a McGuyver (for anyone who watched that in the 80's)when it comes to making things work."
4,Really cool gift idea,"This coffee cup is a faithful recreation of the famous New York City deli coffee cup, from the pattern and colors right down to the slightly off shape that sometimes comes with paper cups.The detail is the neatest thing about this mug. It has a fold in the lip and a crease along the side where the pattern seems to finish its ""wrap"". I'm not sure if it's totally faithful to the actual height of the original paper cup, because it does seem much shorter than other paper cups.It's a good weight and is quite unusual, especially since it has no mug handle. And you can most certainly find it for a better price--Perpetual Kid has it for $10 and I've seen it for $12 at other places as well. Overall, it's a fun gift idea and a cool idea in general."
5,great little cup but it gets hot!,"You will need a sleeve of some sort if you have a hot drink in this, but it looks just like the cups you get in New York. It makes me think of bagels and grand central station. It is also very sturdy and well made. I like it very much."
2,This movie needs some skills !,Let me make a list of all the reason's why I hate 1. Vilonece 2.Bad Voices 3 . one of the girl puppy's sounds like a boy ! 4. Can have better music (No offensive on the musican ) 5. This can put even the 3 year olds to sleep zzz 6. I rather watch blue's clues than this movie (No offensive on the director ) I'm not trying to be mean and this is a pretty cute movie but don't you think a little less vilonece and a little more cutness well got to go on behalf of emperor Kuzco Toodles !
3,This makes me sad....,"Well, it's ok, but some things were way too comical compared to the original. The voice talents could've been better for Lady and her daughters. Although, the voice talents were excellent for the junkyard dogs, epsecially Angel and Scamp. Don't listen to the 5 star reviews for this film. I do however like the cute puppy love scenes. I got this film for my birthday when I was 7, and when Scamp was being taken to the pound, I was crying. Now I'm 12, and I realize how dissapointing it is to the original jewel of a film."
2,"no Peggy Lee, too much pop music = stepping over the line","I didn't think that Disney was going too far with its Disneys sequels until this one was made. Why? becuase it is the first film from Walt Disney's time to get sequel format. i'm sorry but that is seriously insulting one of the greatest animators to ever livebut I was curious. The film was too preachy on the basis of 'hanging out with the right dogs'. But once they started singing pop songs, I went beserk! The original Lady and the Tramp had the Mellow Men and Peggy Lee. Lady, Tramp, Jock, and Trusty were spotlight characters in the original. I was also confused. If Scamp is supposed to be a puppy why does he sound so much like Scott Wolf (HAHAHAHAHA!) Anyway yeah the preachiness and pop music placed this at the bottom,and the fact that Lady had been voiced by Jodie Benson (dont worry you'll be hearing her voice in plenty more cheapquels)"
4,Not as bad as it seems...,"To all you people who think Buster's such a bad guy, give him some credit, will ya?! Yeah, the movie wasn't the most eye catching, but why is it that dobermans are ALWAYS portrayed so badly? From all the dobermans that I've ever met, they ARE ""good, decent, and kind"". And as for Buster being against the rules of 'no housedogs' in the gang, why can't we get any info on HIS background? He probably had some bad past due to being a housedog. Ok, enough of me rambling on. I could do this all day..."
1,wut the heck is wrong with disney,this movie sux disney sequals were never as good as the original but most of them i enjoy like beauty and the beast 2&3 and the lion king sequals but this one suck the vocies are not even close 2 the original one ( i know the could't get the original vocies but could make and effort to have them sound alike) also the music sux and number three i am wondering if walt disney were still alive would the movie be better ( probably would of ) and if he were still alive would he realsie that he shouldn't make sequals that have the same events that the first one had like the dogs eating spaggati and they kiss that also the ending suck i couldn't belive the disney company would make a s***y ending like that this is defenitly on the bottom shelf of my dvd colecction
5,I LOVE this movie!,"It's great! It tells the story about Lady&Tramp's son Scamp who think's life as a ""house dog"" is boring. He runs away to follow his dreams. Angel leads him to the Junkyard and meets street-wise Buster who challenge's Scamp to the test of coller-free life. Soon Scamp&Angel fall in love. Then Scamp has a choice to make: will he live on the streets or with his home and family? Find out and buy this movie with a lesson that you should love and be happy with your family."
4,For a D.T.V. sequel this was surprisingly good,"It has been 22 years since I saw Lady and the Tramp. I think that helped me to enjoy this without comparing it. As a lot of Disney stories do, this one has a moral. I watched it with a 4 year old boy and his mother and we all enjoyed it. It was cute without being sappy. The opening sequence was a little ""gone with the windish."" The voices were well chosen from mostly newer stars. There were a few times where I actually laughed out loud from the antics. If you want to see this to compare to the original, skip it. If you want a family friendly story that most kids and parents can sit and enjoy together, get it. I don't think you'll be disappointed"
2,Disappointment,"I really like the original Lady and the Tramp, and this is a sad attempt to cash in on the fans of that movie.I'd suggest renting it first to see if you like it before investing. My 3.5 year old has only watching half of it. He asked us to put in a different tape."
4,Thought Provoking Read,"Dr. Tribe of Harvard Law makes many interesting points in his book concerning the methods and approach one ought to take while reading or interpreting the Constitution. I would suggest this book to people that have read the Constitution not once but many times and who are looking to further their understanding. On the contrary you should not purchase this book looking for a formula to understand the Constitution! Rather this book promotes one's thoughts and helps the reader develop an approach in which they ought and ought not read the Constitution. Interestingly enough, for Tribe to claim that he knows the manner in which we ought not read the Constitution presupposes that he knows how we ought to. This then contradicts his final chapters when he claims that there is no correct approach to the Constitution and that any one person's interpretation is no more right nor wrong than the next reader's."
2,ripped on one side,The stockings had a hard time staying up even with suspenders. There was already a rip on one stocking in the back.
4,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...] - @tss5078,"Graduation is an intense and clever thriller that surprised the hell out of me. It only got 3 1/2 stars, because the beginning drags on forever, but by the end of this film, you will be very satisfied. This young cast led by TV veteran, Chris Marquette, follows four best friends approaching their high school graduation. Unfortunate circumstances lead them to need a large sum of money and they come up with the only option available to them, rob a bank. This is a tough film to review without spoilers, so I can't say more than that, but this is a very clever film, with some great young actors. Although it was slow at first, the ending makes it all worthwhile, and you'll be very surprised at where the groups choices lead them. This may be a b-movie with a no-name cast, but it's one that will change the way you think about certain things and I highly recommend it!"
5,Who Cares: Watery B Flats,"You will never hear an O Malheureuse from Iphegenie en Tauride like this - ever. Her soul sings this aria; it comes from the depths of her being and her voice is not flawed here in the least; it is rich, rich with tears and texture like no other version ever recorded - It is lament itself, haunting and beautiful. This aria alone, is reason enough to own this CD.When you listen to Callas, you're not hearing her if you're excusing the watery B flats or pointing at acceptable, but short top Cs.This is a must for every Callas collection!"
5,Dollars from your dreams,"A beautiful book for the race horse lover, and for young girls who need inspiration to make their dreams come true. After September 11, when so many woman are having to rebuild shattered lives, and so many young girls will be growing up with the terrible loss of parents to a horrifying situation, this book is a thoughtful way to show young girls you can make it. A girl who not only made it through a terrible war, but came to America alone, and not only made her own dreams come true, eventually made it possible for her whole family to come here and escape the poverty of a war torn country trying to recover from the ravages of that war. Laughs, and dreams, and miracles, and a toughness that gives us a clue that God, and our own endurability will get us through anything."
3,"learned a little, confused by much","I have been doing a lot of self teaching in nutrition and alternative health for 34 years as well as obtaining a BS in nutrition, and I was happy to learn some things and very put off by some of the misinformation I found. The average reader won't of course know what is good to take away and what to skip over. Good luck"
2,Beginners-stay away,"As this was my first book on detoxification, I wasn't too impressed. The only reason I decided to give it a two-star rating is because it does have some pretty good information. The problem is that the author suggests things that at this time I can not afford, I'm a college student that is getting ready to graduate and pay off my schooling and I can not buy air purifiers, water purifiers, and I certainly can't through out my microwave as she suggests. Another problem I that since I'm only beginning to research this topic, I'm also not fully into my vegan diet and certainly don't know enough about fasting to actually do one yet. I assumed the book would be about cleanses, or at least discuss the ins and outs of fasting. All-in-all, not a good book for beginners. That is unless you only want the information contained in a portion of the book. Who knows, maybe it will be of use to me later on when I know more about cleansing and fasting."
3,The ABCs of Making Money - original version,"This was an older version of the book. I wanted the latest one with more updated and relevant examples. Topically, it's a good book."
3,The Basics,This book will give you the basics of a good start for personal financial planning. It goes in the basic requirements needed to start your business. I highly recommend this book for somebody starting in the financial planner field with no previous experience.
4,Nice photos,I liked the photographs in this book but was disappointed by the authors commentary as I found it quite negative overall. I thought that the general picture painted of Montana and the life of Evelyn Cameron was deliberatly bleak. I stopped reading several chapters in and just enjoyed flicking through the photographs.An interesting collection of diary snippets and photos of early pioneer life.
3,harley softail,"this is a good shelf toy only. Not sure what make of harley this is. Has fatboy fenders,heritage wheels and roadking exhaust with a flame job on the tank. This is A good looking bike."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"When I purchased this novel from Amazon, I was expecting a history of German U-Boats in the Mediterranean. After reading the first few pages, I was initially disappointed but was soon drawn into the narrative. The original Sea-Wolves were masters of sail and oar in an era of land battles of spear and shield. Being little more than pirates, the sea-wolves by nature of their supremacy on the sea were able to create an empire. This book is a must for any historian. This albeit little known history would find a comfortable home in any library."
3,Bruckner - symphony no.8,"So far as we know, his 8th symphony is as famous as his 9th and/or 4th.There is also a famous annecdote that all the students of Composer's were really impressed when he first played this symphony by piano.Composer explained that this symphony reflects the life of his living in the country.But, this book (though it seems that the author had been tried his great effort to complete this) just shows the analysis of his 8th.However, thank to author that the most difficult area of discovering Bruckner's symphony at the most detailed situation.All the lovers of 8th symphony are recommended to purchase this item."
4,"Important Weill, but not his best.","'Happy End' was written in German by Kurt Weill and Bertold Brecht shortly after their great success with the original 'The Threepenny Opera' on the Berlin stage. The play has the distinction of being the source of the often performed Bilbao song and the sailors' song. Otherwise, there is not a lot to enjoy, especially as these two pieces are done by so many Weill specialist singers.It is not surprising that unlike 'The Threepenny Opera', 'The Seven Deadly Sins', and 'Mahagonney', there is this one recording of this work. And, if I am to understand the price correctly, it is only available from a third party at a rather dear price.If, in fact, you can't get this for less than $20, don't bother. Spend your money on Ute Lemper or a Lotte Lenya recording."
1,"Poor design, compatibility problems","Unlike the PC version of quickbooks pro which has built in software to handle payroll, the mac version has nothing, and you only have 2 choices that are online access only and overpriced.The interface is incredibly confusing, with hundreds of floating windows that overlap each other and get lost like a messy stack of papers. Simple functions like ""print checks"" or ""edit transaction"" are in the worst possible locations, so even the simplest tasks take forever to complete.After using this for over 2 months and seeing how much better designed the PC version is, I'm buying a cheap PC laptop just so I can use the PC version. I recommend the same for anyone else."
1,Bad choice,"QuickBooks Pro 2006 for Mac is a dreadful option. Simply: it is complicated to use because it requires an entirely different software product for payroll (Aatrix), and it requires lots of customer support since neither the software or informational booklet are not terribly user-friendly. When calling QuickBooks customer support, you're calling India phonebanks and holding on the phone for 1.5 hrs or more until a live voice is heard. Aatrix customer support, while informative and patient, requires the same long wait times. Both lines feature ""hold"" music that is guaranteed to give you a bad hair day and re-cycles frequently. Recommendation for a much better accounting product: MYOBBernie Krause, PhD"
1,Horrible,The product we received did not stay blown up and therefore did not work.. They refuse to give us our money back.
5,Stephanie's review,This book is good. I love K'wan's work he is one of my top fave!! I hope he continues to drop at least 2 books a year!!
5,Eve.... She is that CHICK!!,"Let the record show that I love K'wan's books but this one is my absolute favorite! I received this oldie but goodie as a Christmas present this year and I had to force myself to stop reading it so that it wouldn't end too quickly.Evelyn Panelli is a young woman fresh out of jail from doing a two year bid. In this book we learn that her parents were horribly murdered and she was almost killed as well when she was a little girl. Raised by her Uncle Bobby, she is a little rough around the edges but still quite beautiful. Upon her release, she bumps into her old friend Felon, whom she always had a secret crush on. Take a ride with Eve as she struggles to keep some money in her pocket and deal with the curveballs life has thrown her way. Battling demons, enemies and hustling is this girls way of life!K'wan wrote an amazing story with this one! Amazing word play, well-executed plot, and the characters are all believable. One cannot go wrong with one of his novels!"
3,An interesting read because she's so screwed up!,"Has anyone noticed that most of the rave reviews of this book are by devout Christians?Now -- For those of us who are NOT religious, O'Neill's book is interesting mainly because this woman is a jaw-dropping psychological mess. I feel truly sorry for her children, since O'Neill is obviously someone who should never have had kids. As another reviewer pointed out, she married every man who showed any interest in her, had as many kids as possible, and immediately dumped them in the care of whoever happened to be handy -- even people who had proven themselves untrustworthy or even criminal! I hope that her born-again Christianity has made her a little bit easier for her family to live with.I also was a bit disappointed that there were not more pictures of this very beautiful woman -- especially since her looks seem to be her only redeeming quality!"
5,Couldn't put it down!,"This book is extremely well written and very interesting. Jennifer O'Neill is brutely honest and forth-right - it is truly unbelievable the life that this beautiful woman has endured...but, she has survived because she found The Answer! My only wish is that there had been more pictures, as is usual in an autobiography...however, because of the content there were probably privacy issues at stake."
5,Perfect Recipe Book!,This book is perfect for the home brewer. All recipes are for 5 gallon batches and range very from simple to more complex.A great and specific book to brew beer with. I am excited!
4,Get this one before you run out of time,"Mark Isham delivers a hard hitting action score that is something you wouldn't expect to come from him. The music is composed for a good sized orchestra with some electronics thrown in for good measure. The main theme, found in ""Time Cop"" and ""Rescue and Return"" is a good one played mainly on strings and piano that is largely underused. ""Melissa"" contains a sultry like saxophone solo that returns in the final track. The majority of the remainder of the score is action music that contains lots of brass and percussion. High trumpets are heard in most of the tracks (Isham is a trumpet player, so go figure!) ""Blow Up"", ""Lasers and Tasers"", ""Polaroid"", ""Rooftop"", and ""C4"" are full of action music with low brass and piano beats keeping it moving. The length of the score is only 30 minutes and is very hard to find, but if you do, I suggest checking it out. It's short, hard hitting, and full of action."
2,Not for somebody outside of psychology as a profession.,"I must confess that I did not get satisfied with this book as somebody outside of the psychology as a profession. It mainly deals with the semantics and there are enormous repetitions. Besides, it is not lucid. It may be of value for somebdy preparing a scientific research about hate as a psychological phenomenon, but it is not for somebody who inquires about the history, evolution and basis of hate. I put two stars, because I did not want to say I hated a book which's subject is hate."
4,Awonderful book to read,In this book coelho talks much more directly to his readres. If you are emerged in his world you will find this book as a friend relating his own experiences. if you are not into mistiques of this nature you will gather a lot of info about it. You may even go so far as to develope a more keen interest into this world. I can't call myself a believer yet I can say that after reading this book I would like to know more about the world that was presented here.
3,Make your own assumptions,This book was not easy for me to get through. You are being told that it is a true story but parts seem extremely hard to believe. Not that he isn't telling the truth but maybe it just wasn't being told in the best possible way for you to find it believable. Maybe there wasn't a message for me to get out of this book. And maybe there will be a message for you to get out of this book. Coelho's books are always sprinkled with messages. As a fan of his work I was compelled to read it. I may read it again in the future and who knows I might think it is the most brilliant book written.
5,Paulo Coelho is the best,"Me encantaria escribir mi critica en ingles, pero es muy malo, asi que espero que alguien pueda entenderme. Soy de Argentina y es la primera vez que veo este libro, no se si quiera si esta traducido al catellano, me gustaria saber si hay alguna traduccion.Con respecto a otros titulos de Coelho, les puedo decir que es uno de los mejores escritores que ha pasado por mis manos, El alquimista, La quinta montaña, El peregino de Compostela, son verdaderamente maravillosos, sinceramente creo que ademas de ser una lectura agradable dejan muchas lecciones de vida, si tienen la oportunidad se los recominedo, les aseguro que ademas de disfrutar de la lectura de un muy buen libro, aprenderan asombrosas lecciones de vida."
2,Not one of Coelho's finest,This novel is so different from the Alchemist or the Pilgrimage. I would skip this if you are going down the list of Coelho's writings.
2,This mouse is a Rat,"I have had nothing but a horrible experience with this little rat. I have the wireless key in the front of my computer, about three feet away.The clicking and scrolling inconsistancies will drive you absolutely crazy. When scrolling I will wait somtimes a couple seconds, which doesn'tsound like much, but when one expects instant response it is forever. Also it is a little on the small side but it is comfortable to use when itworks correctly. I am very surprized with this rat as Logitech usually makes very fine products. Very disappointed in this productand will be sending it back"
1,unfortunately stop working,I love logitech products. I guess I just was unfortunate that this mouse stopped working for me after 1 week of use. :((((((
2,"Great, when it works","Maybe I'm one of the unlucky few who got a lemon, but my V450 Cordless Mouse performs very inconsistently. When the thing works, it's really good. It's got a nice size and weight that feels good in an average sized hand. The sensitivity and accuracy of the mouse pointer seem spot on.HOWEVER, the mouse frequently loses contact with the transmitter, which is ridiculous since they're barely 15"" apart. I'm right handed and have the transmitter plugged in to the left side of my keyboard so it's never in the way. When the connection drops the mouse starts to lag and stutter, the buttons stop working, and the only fix is to unplug and replug the transmitter. This is a problem as the connection issue surfaces a couple times in a work day. I've tried plugging the transmitter into other USB outlets on the keyboard and iMac but it's always the same thing."
2,Wanted to like this mouse,"After five months of home use this mouse has had it. Constantly clicking to get it to work and it eats batteries. It also is for a laptop, not my stand alone computer. So, maybe I'm not being fair? Just bought a Logitech M150 from Amazon, and it is everything the rated mouse was not."
2,Good ernonomics but one heavy problem,"So I like the ergonomics of this mouse overall. Light click-touch, fits well in your hand, the wheel moves smoothly, lots of pluses.But who at Logitech got the brainy idea of designing a mouse with two double AA batteries? After you use this thing for a while it's like lifting a small brick.Bad design idea. It's going back :-("
5,You can't kill it...,"I can't tell you how many times I've accidentally thrown this mouse across the room and/or slammed it against the wall when I was picking up my laptop tray to move somewhere else--forgetting to grab the mouse, too. I have even stomped on it a few times when I'd sleepily set my laptop tray on the floor beside my bed and then knocked it off when getting up the next morning. I have never had such an indestructible piece of computer equipment in my life! So, if for no other reason than this, it's worth every penny.But the mouse is also a superlative, comfortable, hard-working little critter. It's ultra-precise even when I use my belly as a mouse pad late at night when I can't seem to extricate myself from the Vulcan Mind Meld with my computer. I programmed the right/left tilt wheel as forward/back, and that alone has speeded me up and improved the ergonomics of bed-surfing considerably. I hate to admit it, because it sounds so dorky, but I really do LOVE this mouse...."
1,I hate this mouse!,"Maybe I have a defective example, but this mouse is NOT accurate. There is a frequent delay or hesitation when moving or clicking. I often have to click a second time because the first was not transmitted. Also, one of the stated benefits of a laser device is the ability to tolerate difficult surfaces. I often use this mouse on a level couch cushion and the pickup is spotty and intermittent. The same surface was perfectly fine for my older-style optical mouse.I will try returning this for another unit but I'm not holding out hope. It really seems like a half-baked product. (Lots of these available on ebaY as refurbs....hmmmm. I may be adding another one to the pile.)"
3,Good Stuff,"Bought this one on a whim after reading some of the other reviews. Very pleased with it, although it's a little too funky at times for an old rocker like me. Definately would recommend it though."
4,"Out of date, but excellent resource of older psychotropics","I am a psychiatrist with 25 years experience - this is a 1991 book, but was easily the best manual of it's time. It has good reviews of special topics - ie. substance abuse, pregnancy, seizures etc. It makes a good inexpensive supplement for a more up to date reference.bob"
5,One of the very BEST fantasy novels for children!,"This is still one of my favorite books, for children or adults. It's pure and wonderful fiction, but don't forget that the Irish world of the ""little people"" can be considered part of Tir Nan Og (aka Tir Na Nog). I suspect the ""Og"" part came from that term. If you like books such as ""The Borrowers"" by Norton, and have a sense of the ridiculous, you'll love this enchanting book!"
1,A huge disappointment over 2005 version,"When converting my 2005 data over to 2006 version it lost all of my time data. I have to rebuild my datafile just to use the check register now. Also the new program will not allow me to add a vendor or a customer. I've had to change names and addresses of obsolete customers and vendors just to add new ones.Intuit's support sucks and cannot seem to resolve my problems. I have two copies on two different computers and am having the same problems with my data file on each computer. My recommendation is if you are using the 2005 version, and don't need tax tables, don't mess with 2006 version. It has literally cost me thousands of dollars of my time trying to work out the bugs on my own."
2,Support Stinks,"From my experience just about all support calls are routed off shore.Most of the tech support staff just take your question and type it into their work station. They say ""May I put you on hold while I check my resources"". Then they read answers off their screen. Several times I had to say to the tech - I can't understand your English. If you buy the package I'd find a local QB certified accountant and pay him/her for their time."
4,A Great New Book,"I plan to utilize ""The Making of a Bestseller"" as a text in my creative writing courses. It's a great resource on the writing life as well as thoroughly good reading."
5,CROSS STITCH TEDDIES IS GREAT,"ANY CROSS STITCHER WILL LOVE THESE GREAT DESIGNS. THEY VARY FROM THE SUPER EASY TO DESIGNS FOR THE MORE EXPERENCED CROSS STITCHER. IF YOU LOVE TEDDYBEARS OR KNOW SOMEONE WHO DOES YOU ARE SURE TO FIND A GREAT DESIGN IN THIS BOOK. IT HAS BIBS, FRAMEABLE PIECES, SOME WOULD MAKE GOOD CARDS. IT IS REALLY A GOOD BOOK."
3,Shoulder wrap,Must put the whole wrap in freezer. Got it to use after pitching softball games and it is pretty much impossible to keep frozen during a game.
3,Ok but not great,Bought this for my son: high school sophomore paying football & baseball. Adjust well out of the box before it's frozen. When it freezes more like ice than like the newer gel packs. Once frozen we found it hard to get it to mold to all the areas that needed the cold. He's still using it but it's not as effective as I had hoped. I'm looking for a similar design that uses gels instead.
3,"Cheaper at Walmart, but I bought the last one there and needed 4 more.","This is a fine product. No extra do-dads or knick knacks. I just ended up paying extra for the convenience of having it sent to my home instead of going out and finding it. Welcome to the 21st Century, I guess."
2,Rosle made in China is rough around the edges,"I've bought dozens of Rosle items. The current batch of Made in China items are making me hesitant to buy any more Rosle items unless they're made in Germany, like they used to be.I have this vegetable spoon. Just received it today. The front lip is rough if I use my fingernail to go along the edge, all around the spoon.The quality control and finishing of Rosle items made in China are MUCH lower than the brand and the price deserve.Beware if you buy Rosle in the USA. It's probably 'Made in China' and a second rate item."
3,Buy part one first,"This is the second volume of a classic text in probability. However the references to the first volume are ubiquitous. The first volume is more introductory and hence more readable for someone like me that is not expert in probability theory. I used volume one years ago and remember it as being much more appropriate at my level. It does amaze me that the topics are highly relevant today with the current interest in stable distributions in finance and hydrology. I give it 3 stars because of the many references to part one, so it does not stand alone."
4,"Near Top of the Line, with VerySlight Flaws!!","Yes, this is mostly a wonderful, realistic mystery where members of a family and 1800's guild end up dead for no apparent reason in 1973 England. Some fine characterisations, scenery, and 1970's culture, and classy writing throughout! Not to mention the intriguing interaction between the 2 eccentirc detectives in a new Crimes Unit. There is the by-now customary lack of fear among those linked with the victims,which seems very unrealistic, plus family squabbling that gets to be irritating. My main complaint is the solution,though interesting, seems somewhat over-inventive. Nonetheless, a very pleasant,interesting , and unique whodunnit that aproaches five-stars, but does not quite succeed"
4,Rieu's Early Salon Sound,"If you share my interest in Andre Rieu's very early work, you will love this CD. It is from 1985, when Andre had formed the 5-piece Maastricht Salon Orchestra (MSO) and is the earliest work I have yet found. This CD contains, in their original salon music form, many of the pieces he now plays with his full orchestra. Since some of the music was meant for a 5-piece ensemble, the interpretations have a different sound and character that is delightful and charming. There are also a couple pieces on this CD that I have never heard anywhere else."
2,Not Compatible with iPod Touch 2G; Mediocre Sound,"The Philips AZ1330D is NOT compatible with the iPod Touch 2G - it displays an error message on the iPod to tell you that it will not charge from this boombox.\And the sound quality of this device (with or without the bass boost) will not please any audiophile (though one shouldn't expect much for the price).On the positive side, the radio (AM and FM) seems to work OK, and the design is attractive. But the lack of iTouch 2G compatibility was a great disappointment, as it was the primary reason I bought this."
5,I couldn't put it down,"I was led to the book because the author's sister is a personal friend of ours. I am originally from southern Illinois and my family was involved in coal mining. I remember all the oil pump-jacks waving at me when I was a small boy and the business intrigued me. I learned so much from this book as I laughed sometimes and also occasionally got choked up. This gripping novel combined hard-work, religion, patriotism, and the love between brothers in a great struggle to make a living from Mother Earth. The author did an excellent job in researching the subjects written about, and a marvelous job conveying them to the reader. I would reccomend this book to anyone who can appreciate all the work our ancestors went through to build this great nation. Thankyou Ron Gawthorp for giving us this literary masterpiece and thankyou to your sister Debbie for making it available to me."
3,"Uneven, but still worth listening to","This album is a definite improvement over Grant's first two, in the number of good songs it has if not the quality of the songs themselves. ""All I Ever Have to Be"" (sung, sometimes whispered, in a choked voice), ""Don't Give Up On Me,"" ""Look What Has Happened To Me,"" ""Too Late,"" and perhaps especially ""Walking Away With You,"" are all good songs, but the album is marred with slow, dragging numbers such as ""Family"" and ""So Glad."" Still, worth having [There's always the fast-forward button for ""Family"" and the rewind and play (again) buttons for ""Walking Away With You"")]."
5,Music That Moves,"NEVER ALONE may not have the high, polished sound that Amy's more recent albums exemplify, but that doesn't dilute the album's moving messages and majestic arrangements. From powerful songs about making Christian choices (""If I Have To Die,"" ""Too Late"") to quiet ballads about accepting God's will (""So Glad,"" ""All I Ever Have To Be"") to upbeat tunes that acknowledge the wonderful transformation of salvation (""Look What Has Happened To Me,"" ""It's A Miracle""), this is all-around a great Christian album. Don't let the date throw you -- this album is worthy of any listener's purchase."
5,My Grandchildren love this toy.,"My grandchildren loved these toys. I ordered two ,Ty, and Pablo. The prices were great, and I will order more toys. Thank you so much."
1,Incredible,"It's hard to understand how these very clever, very articulate, very savvy gang-types can couch their arrogant drivel into long strings of huff & puff rhymes, dip & bop on stage, and then get glamorized and idolized.It reminds me of the phrase ""The whole world may embrace a purveyor of nonsense, and yet his spewings are still stupidity."""

5,Hilarious book,"This book is a little on the cheesy side, but hilarious. Definitely a funny page turner, especially if you grew up in a southern, everybody knows everybody town, where everyone is conservative, and anything out of the ordinary is an adventure."
5,Best finnish book,I love this book. I read this book once a year. Reading this book you will learn every time more of human life. Try this book
1,New isn't better,I have been using an older Z-Fogless mirror for years and decided it was time to replace it.These new mirrors with adjustable magnification are just terrible. Like wearing the wrong glasses or taking acid while shaving. They should just go back to a basic 8 x 10 sized regular mirror.
5,WOW,"This doesnt have the best smell to it and has a bit of an oily feel, but if you apply when erect,, wait 5 munites or so you can go at least an hour or longer. I really like it"
4,Good material. Presure is not strong as expected.,"It works well for me. I can last triple or four time longer than before. I use it with condom, then it does not have bad effect on my wife. However, I cannot make it quickly as I want when my wife wants to stop. The problem I may think of is that the spray does not have strong presure as I expected. I am not sure whether it is already used, or without a seal. Whatever the way it is packed, the spray is not as a spray at all. It is almost a tiny drop."
5,Stunning,"I'm not great at putting opinions into words so this will be brief. This album is utterly amazing. Very emotional and biting, not in an ""Emo"" sense like Sunny Day Real Estate but Hank Williams/Jeffrey Lee Pierce Emo. Immerse yourself now."
1,I ordered 2 of these items and none of them work,I ordered 2 of these items and none of them works. Only one side works in both of them and I am really frustrated.
1,Haven't received the item yet!,"I have not received the item in spite of contacting the seller. I'm sure the part would work well if I actually received it, but I haven't seen it yet."
1,Ethernet cable splitter,"I don't know if the one I got was just bad, or if this item is a rip off completely, but it did not work."
1,Yawn,"This sorry movie never rises above the poor writing and the many failed attempts at humor. It is boring, and the other one-star reviewers describe it accurately.Jim Carrey is a fine actor with a number of good movies to his credit. This one is at the bottom of the pile."
3,that is a negative,"This seems like a romantic comedy with a feel good messageby Jim Carey with his rent a new female star per movie program?No one sane can possible say yes to everything?It sounds like a perfect way to end upin real big trouble, not with a job promotion,or a new pretty but dumb girl friend....So this guy's life degenerates to near chaos,and he jumps off a bridge ( bungee).He goes from a lonely loser to a fellow with too many phony friends?Turning you life around and getting a second chanceat love is not going to happen to everybodyeven if they do say yes.The movie is a light comedyand the acting is mostly light weight as well:an LA fluff movie."
4,Amazon Needs to Update the Product Title & Images,"This review is simply about the product purchased directly from Amazon and not about the movie itself.The product title that I am reviewing is: ""Yes Man (Two-Disc Special Edition)"" and the current image of the DVD cover states that this is a ""Two-Disc Digital Copy Special Edition"". This however, is incorrect. This product only contains one disc and no longer features the second disc, containing a digital copy. According to the back cover image, the second disc was only available through ""April 06, 2010"". Personally, I don't really care about having the digital copy, but I thought future Amazon customers should be aware."
1,Not worth it,Yellow lab ripped the thing up in 5 minutes after i left him alone with it. It doesn't fly like a frisbee either to heavy.
4,Mouth-watering,"""Modern Asian Flavors: A Taste of Shanghai"" is a delightful journey through author's, Richard Wong, heritage and upbringing. The recipes are simple and sophisticated, and like the back cover of the book declares, ""bursting with flavor"".Wong's recipes are easy-to-follow and show a more modern approach to Asian cuisine. The photographs are gorgeous making each dish look mouth-watering.Chapters included in this book are: Shanghainese Sauces; Cocktails & Appetizers; Soups & Salads; Poultry & Meat; Fish & Shellfish; Vegetables, Rice and Noodles; and Desserts. Some of the tasty recipes you can find in here are: Ginger-tini, Hot and Sour Soup, Skewered Sesame Chicken, and Peach Wonton Crisps.This is a wonderful book!"
1,Bars closed for a year should not be listed in an book,"there are bars with wrong addresses and bars that have been closed for months. Jazz standard clsed 4 months ago, Iridium moved 3 months ago, and Astor Lounge changed it's name a year ago....that's just a start....hope this years restaurant guide is better than their nightlife product."
2,the song before the engagement party,"The song before the engagement party is called ""In These Shoes."" I can't remember the artist--something like Kristy McColl. Bette Midler has also sung it."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A loner bookworm nerd girl is doing her own thing, working away, when she gets an invitation.She accepts, and ends up staying with a very strange bunch, and she soon is in further than she thinks, pregnant, with the vampiric Scarabae hovering around, wanting to use her for their own ends."
4,Works pretty well at controlling oil.,"I have very oily skin, and this product does what I've read all over the internet. It controls the oil on my face. It's not all shiny like normal. If you are looking for something that controls that greasy shine on your forehead this is it. But, it does smell a little funny."
5,DON DOKKEN RULES,"up from the ashes is a great cd that proves there is life after dokken.(lynch era)great songwriting & musicians make this one of my favorites from don.also, check out ""ERASE THE SLATE"" with reb beach (of winger) on guitar.reb smokes lynch like a pipe."
5,Sweet and Fun,"I have loved this album since I was a little girl. It blends upbeat lyrics with charming melodies that make you want to sing! There is a good balance between fun, even comedic songs with more thoughtful creations with gently touching lyrical phrases. This is definately one of my favorite albums not only by Amy Grant but in the Christian genre as a whole! Listening to it is a truly inspirational experience."
4,Amy with her unique Worship,"Amy Grant's debut album is an excellent, fun-filled, clean CD. But I was surprised about how short it was. 13 tracks and only 36 minutes. Even after considering this is from 1977 (all songs were short then) I still couldn't beleive it. Even that didn't keep me from buying her next 2 albums. If you want to get your first Amy Grant CD, choose this, AGE TO AGE, or LEAD ME ON."
4,Deckplate Mod,"For all you 4runner owners looking into buying a deck plate for the deckplate mod, this is the one I used. Worked like a champ!"
5,Classic Danish,"I received this watch this morning with my partner's watch. When I open the box, I am so surprise as the watch is very light in weight, soft sparkling, and simple. The first impression about this watch is timeless design, classical, simple, beautiful, so woman, elegant, expensive looks although it is less than $55. The bracelet is easy to adjust, no need to go to jewelry store to fix it, you even can do it by yourself. The problem only in date which is too small, but I think I don't need that, and don't damage the overall performance of this watch. The gold trim around dial makes this watch is more sophisticated. I am so happy with this watch, although not the expensive ones of my watch collections, I love this :) It's a gift from lover, so, what is more important than all? Enjoy your purchase of this watch."
4,Skagen Quality,"Skagen Women's Two-Tone Mesh Watch #355SGSCQuality merchandise from this Skagen watch. This is the first Skagen I have owned, but have always admired them from afar. The craftsmanship is precise, bold yet delicate. I love the two-tone of silver with gold because it is much more versatile with both kinds of jewelry. The only issue for me is the size of the face -- I prefer a slightly larger face and dial. It is easier to read. Still an excellent watch for quality and price."
2,crystal is a problem,"Bought one of these for my wife. Crystal cracked within one week. Crystal is not covered by warranty. She liked the style a lot, so I bought a replacement for about $10 more than a replacement crystal would have cost. Crystal was scratched within 2 weeks."
4,Beautiful Watch,"This watch is beautiful and the perfect size for my tiny wrists. I had to adjust the band almost to its last place, but it fits!!! The size of the watch is not overpowering to my frame, and it is light in weight. It feels like I'm not wearing a watch at all, but I definitely feel naked without it. I've been a fan of Skagen watches for a very long time. My last watch was actually run over by my car (I dropped it) and still kept perfect time. I had to replace the band and the face was cracked, but I still wore it for another 8 months before finding this one. The one flaw I could find was that a screw was left off the the place where the band attaches to the watch. Other than that, I'm so very glad I bought this watch!"
5,Less is More.,Excellent interpretation of Debussy piano pieces. Tempo and pauses allow full enjoyement of the sophisticated structural simplicity of thecompositions. Sequence and choice of selected pieces at his best.Priceless. One of my favorite CD's.
2,Columbia Press let its guard down,"The Garden of Ediacara reads like a 295-page Valentine card written by Mark A. S. McMenamin to Mark A. S. McMenamin. I have never seen such egotistic indulgence in a work which claims to be a scientific treatise. Nor have I ever seen an author cite his own (rather ordinary) words in a chapter epigraph! Where the reader might have enjoyed a color photo of an Ediacaran animal, he or she is treated instead to a color photo of Mark A. S. McMenamin's identification card. This is like showing the reader your driver's license (by the way it happens to have a photograph of Mark A. S. McMenamin's face on it). Columbia Press really let its guard down and this thing will take its rightful place as an awkward sore, much like the writings of Wilhelm Reich of ""orgone energy"" fame."
2,Too much author; too little subject,"In my experience, scientists are a modest lot. Unfortunately, some science popularists seem to have an ego the size of all outdoors. However, if you have the patience to battle your way through the I said..., I did..., I am..., then McMenamin's book contains a few interesting snippets for anyone interested in the Vendian biota.Alternatively, you could read Chapter 3 of ""Major Events in the History of Life"" (Ed. by J. William Schopf and available from Amazon) in which Bruce Runnegar writes about the fossils (rather than about Bruce Runnegar.)"
2,Get what you pay for?,"What do you get for $36.12 after UPS ground shipping? A piece of foam two feet square by two inches thick. (2'x2'x2"") The Amazon description doesn't help saying its SIZE is 5.9 lbs and WEIGHT is also 5.9 lbs. (It actually weighs 1lb 1oz so not sure where they got close to six from.) I make a living as a full time sound guy and compared to other products I use this is one expensive piece of foam if your main use is to deaden sound. So unless you absolutely have to have a the color there are other options that will likely do the job."
2,"Horrible! All bass, no mids or treble!!!!!","My [...]$ Philips surround sound, in-ear plugs I picked up at a CVS pharmacy sounds ten times better than this piece of crap. This is so heavy with bass that I couldn't even hear some instruments that I knew were in the high ranges! Don't believe those reviewers that suggest that a set of headphones needs to be broken in! Better to return this before the thirty days return time period elapses. Awful!!"
1,Cheap and Nasty,These headphones sound awful. There is all sorts of hype on the packaging about how they contain the latest technology - they even tout that the headphone lead uses oxygen free copper! What a con. All the other bad reviews are correct in saying that these headphones are low grade boom boxes with a muffled midband and virtually no treble. Give them a good listen before you part with the cash
1,sony is the worst company,sony camera's are the worst to repair. they charge you $200.00 for a flash. That is almost the same price as a new one. Buy the other brands. they have local shops that will fix warrenty problems SONY does NOT have this. you have to send it to Texas. I don't even live in a state that touchs Texas. Please Buy a different brand of camrea you will be much happier. the parts and acc. are more as well.
1,Not satisfied,"I purchased this camera on May 26, 2005 my very first digital camera. The only good thing is the size. I did read the manual very carefully. It is very difficult to focus with this camera specially indoors. Sony advertise the Macro system but 95% of the time you can not focus with the macro function. The battery drains out completely after approximately 15-20 pictures. So be prepared to have at least one spare if not 2. The LCD has a very good size and bright however I think that is the problem in leaving the battery empty. I am surprised at sony and their reputation not to address such important issue.The very positive aspect was when I returned to Amazon I was credited back with in 24 hours an excellent service by amazon my hats off to them for their support.Bottom line is do not spend $450.00 for this camera it is only good for one purpose and that is to Show Off."
2,Item is rough from casting,You'll have to finish this material extensively as it comes rough from casting.I would have expected a more finished material.I would not purchase it again.
5,James Garneer's favorite,"This is one of the best war/antiwar movies made, while at the same time being quite funny. It is Garner's favorite film and is still as topical and pertinent today as it was when made. His soliloquy about war is perhaps the most telling indictment of war, its causes, and its perpetuation ever. I have loved this film since I first saw it and have never met anyone who did not like it. Black and white, it gives one the chance to hear rather than see, to experience rather than imagine.I cannot recommend this film highly enough."
4,Lighting not impressive....,I use this hand held to apply make-up and tweeze eyebrows. The 10x side is perfect for tweezing and applying mascara. Lights are not worth putting buying the batteries for!
4,Mirror Not Lighted,This is NOT a lighted mirror. There are two useless LED lights in the handle. Waste of batteries!The mirror itself is fine in regular and in reverse (magnified).
4,The best and only comprehensive book on the science.,"Want to know what psychologists, rather than philosophers, have to say about consciousness? Want a quick, authoritative survey of scientific research on sleep and dreams, hypnosis, meditation? This is the best and only comprehensive book reviewing scientific research on consciousness and various altered states of consciousness. It's a little old now, and in need of revision, but it's still the best place to start."
5,Amy's Best Album,"I really like this album, my favorite song is Walking Away With You. I like all of the songs they are very pretty and loud."
1,don't buy this Sennheiser RS 130,"IT'S WAIST OF MONEY. EVERY 2-3 MINS, WHEN YOU ARE LISTENING THE SOUND GOES OFF AND ON FOR 10-15 SEC. DON'T BUY IS WAIST OF MONEY."
1,This item sucks,"I recently purchased this item. It had a lot of background noise and after about 10 minutes, everything shut down and stopped working. I don't recommend this product."
4,Wireless,Local stores did not seem to stock non-bluetooth wireless headphones. It's hard to buy without listening to the sound quality. While I am not fussy about sound it must be clear and free of static or background noise. This set sounds great by my standards using recorded music from a Bose Wave Radio. I am able to listen all over my house. Setup and connection was effortless. Charging stand is nice and functions well. Volume is much more than adequate.Price at just over $100 was excellent. Shipping was fast and reasonable.
5,great deal,I got this product on a great sale at amazon and now others visit and want to get it only to see the normal price is $200. I'm not sure it's worth $200 but if you get it for around $100 I think you'll be pretty happy
2,disappointed,"When I first purchased the headphones, I was pleased with the sound quality and the fact that others did not have to suffer from a loud television when viewing shows with me. Within a month, there was a buzz in the left earphone. It was tolerable, but continued to get worse. Today, I am shipping the earphones back to Sennheiser because the buzz is overpowering. I hope that they will honor the warranty."
5,Very happy with wireless headphones.,"I had previously purchased a pair of Sony wireless headphones from BestBuy (for approx the same amount as these). Unfortunately, I did not research the Sony headphones until after the purchase at which time I learned that they did not receive good reviews. I then did more research, found that this brand received much higher reviews and purchased them from a very good dealer. We have been more than pleased with them in all aspects (ease of use, sound quality, comfort, etc.)Sennheiser RS 130 Wireless Surround Sound Headphones"
2,Not impressed!,"I received this item on 10/20/10 and returned them to J&R; on 10/21/10Very unhappy with this headphone. Not enough volume and hiss! The user guide indicates some TV,s will interfere with the transmitter and they are right. A constant easily heard hum when the TV is on. This is not present if the LCD TV is off. I have no hum in my 20 year old Radio Shack open ear headphones and they actually sound better the the Sennheiser's. I had worked in the audio industry for a good 12 years and Sennheiser made great headphones then and I think they still do. Just not this wireless model. The SRS surround sound feature very poor."
2,Not worth it,"While I initially thought these headphones were acceptable, I can't take it any more. When I listen to music from the next room, the constant cut-outs whenever I tilt my head and ever-present hiss detract from my listening experience so much that I now refuse to use these headphones. They are OK if I am right next to the receiver, but I'd prefer to use wired 'phones for that, as the sound is far superior. I finally tossed them today, as I couldn't even listen to my new CD; more hiss and drop-outs than music. In my mind, it was money down the drain. I had another pair of wireless (900mHz) headphones previously with similar results. I thought the digital tuning on these would reduce the poor reception, but I couldn't tell any difference. From now on, I'll deal with the inconvenience of extension cords in preference to wireless headphones."
5,Better than Sony,These are great. We had two different Sony wireless headphones that required line of site. These don't need line of sight and have a much larger broadcast range. Very comfortable. Best price at Amazon.
5,Excellent,Bought these for my husband for Christmas and he still raves about them!!! Read the reviews on all the others before buying and they have lived up to all of the positive reviews/comments.
4,Headphones,"This is a pretty good product and the reviews I had read were good. The only thing is now after 3 months of having it and not using it much, you can not hear very good out of one side. I hope it's under warranty..."
4,Very good wireless,"I have owned a pair of these at work for maybe 3 years now. They work great. i have a pair of Accoustic Research at home, they are terrible. I used to have some old Sennheisers R-40 but I broke them. These new ones worried me with the auto tuner but I need not have, they do a good job. I wish i had bought 2 pairs. Some friends at work still are not concinvced but they do not have a wireless alternative. There is static some times, but its short lived and very tollerable. Unlike those AR's."
4,Awesome for the price.,Awesome besides some rare static now and then. Some minimal static is noticeable when there is no music/sound playing or it's really quiet.
4,Cool Wireless Headphones,"I got these to use in my great room while watching TV as the great room is open to the second floor and the kids rooms. They do a very good job with some minor hissing occasionally but not enough to make it an issue and better than any other wireless headphones I've tried before. The other thing I love is that you can actually have a conversation or listed to monitors for the kids rooms while they are on. That was a big point for me.I would say at this price point the quality is very good, I like the ergonomics and I would recommend this product."
5,RS 130 Wireless - Fantastic,"The RS 130 Headphones are perfect for watching TV at night with the wife.I first tried the Sony IR ones and i had a noticeable hiss 95% of the time.Not an issue with the RS130's I can lay down, cover my head. and still have crystal clear reception.If you have been hesitating like I have... You need not Sennheiser has made come quality headphones here."
4,Sennheiser RS 130 Wireless Surround Sound Headphones,I was looking for a wireless headphones that would provide with good sound quality and trouble free functionality. The Senheiser RS 130 meet both requirements. They are light weight and easy to set up.
2,Poor quality and design,"I purchased this product and returned it after just 2 weeks. The battery would not recharge and the switch for controlling the volume and channel is in the back so that when you rest your head back against a chair the volume/channel button is changed unintentionally. This is a poor design feature. Lastly, the design looks outdated."
4,"Could be better, but for the money is a good choice","I read the consumer report reviews on this headphone and decided to buy it. The headphone sounds clear. The lows and highs are very well balanced. The only thing is the signal from the base. Sometimes you loose the signal and it sounds fuzzy, but for the money this is a very good headphone. Thanks"
3,OK for the Price,"I purchased this item a few weeks ago to replace headphones that I originally purchased from The Sharper Image, but returned because my kids stepped on them. I paid $60 for the refurbished Sennheiser 130 item. Compared to the Sharper Image product, which cost $99, the Sennheiser is inferior. The range is poor, there is excessive hiss, and the sound quality is marginal. Although I was hoping for something better, I'm not surprised since I only paid $60. The charging stand has a nice design -- this was one thing about the Sharper Image product I didn't like."
2,"Hiss, Click, Beep All Day Long","My brother graciously got me this pair of headphones off my Amazon wishlist - I had been really impressed by the reviews here and the idea of wireless headphones is pretty darn cool.These headphones are comfortable around the head. The stand is stylish and futuristic, and it is really pretty superbly neat to be able to walk around listening to music without having any cords at all.But for a $100 pair of headphones, the fact that they are constantly hissing, clicking (rather loudly) and periodically beep during quiet bits as they channel-seek is incredibly annoying. It's not even constant, quiet hiss - the hiss will get louder and quieter at random intervals and when you turn your head...even if you are only two feet from the transmitter! Gah. I really don't use them at all unless there are no other headphones around because they are so bothersome.If this is the best wireless headphones can do, I'd stick with wires if I were you."
4,Sennheiser rs 130,"I purchased these to replace an older pair of JVC wireless headphones. So far, I've been very pleased with the quality and sound quality. These are surround sound headphones so they add that feature which is nice. I use the headphones while running on my treadmill and they are light and very comfortable."
3,Good but not great,There is a lot of static on this set and the sound quality is not as good as a cheaper pair I bought for 30 dollars.
2,Sennheiser wireless headphones - too $ for the poor reliability,"I bought these and for the first 4 months they worked terrific. Then they became intermittent - drop outs with just static which started out lasting only about 5 seconds and occuring only once in about 25 minutes. I endured this for about 7-8 months until one day the drop outs became worse and then they stopped working completely. Thank goodness for extended warrantees. If you buy these be sure to get an extended warranty. Such a shame something that started out sounding so wonderful only lasted a few months. These were handled with TLC - never touch by critters or children and never exposed to moisture, vibration, shock, etc. I'm having serious difficulty justifying the purchase of another set from them even though Sennheiser has been a big name in headphones for decades. The phones shouldn't have died for many years!!Sennheiser RS 130 Wireless Surround Sound Headphones"
2,Hissing sound,Disappointed that the RS130 has a very noticeable hissing sound. This may be due to the volume knob to be on the high end to produce a good volume. There was no other way to turn up the sound from my TV.
4,The title song along is worth the price of the CD,"I had stopped listening to Joni Mitchell for a while, relying mostly on my favorites like ""Court and Spark."" A friend played this for me in '92, and I still play it once a month or so. Some of the tracks seem a bit experimental, like Cherokee Louise, but the title song is so amazing that it sort of stays with me. Maybe because it highlights her voice more than some tracks, where she's more like another instrument. I feel silly putting stars on an artist's album, but the ones above are in the context of her other work."
2,Sophisticated but rather shallow playing,"Ciccolini's recording of Satie's piano music had dominated decades as finest set, but only because there wasn't any rivals at the time. Now compared to other superior recordings, his playing, highly sophisticated, sounds rather conventional and shallow. I get an impression that this pianist regarded Satie's music as some witty light music. I would love complete satie piano works played with more depth and delicacy (Leeuw's earlier recording comes close to ideal, but it was not complete set). Thibaudet's complete recording is very fine, but again without much depth."
4,a good buy if you're patient,"It's a good deal. It looks pretty but a little heavy than my other batteries. It works well but needs to recharge for 15 hours, which, to me, is a pain in the a..."
3,Okay price -,The price on this item was good. The batteries charged overnight okay but the light on the charger never went out. When I put the batteries in another charger they continued charging for only a few minutes indicating that they were basically charged. I like the fact that you can do either 4 AAA or 4AA batteries at one time.
4,disappointment,"If you have a problem with your order with a1books, then you're out of luck b/c it's not possible to get ahold of the company."
2,bad xerox copy of a book,What a rip off. this book was over $100 and the pictures & charts are grainy & look like 3rd generation bad reproductions of a black and white copy. I need it for a class so it's not like I can return it.
2,Rip off,This book seems to be a copy of the original. I am not sure if that's the way it should look. I ordered a new book. The pictures and some of the wording is difficult to read. Have to strain eyes. Very unhappy.
2,very predictable,"cliche story, predictable end. Is people expected to be surprised by the fact that he came back a different person after war? anyone who knows what war is wont be surprised with movie. Besides, they are a weird family: nobody (wife and kids, parents and brother) really cries when they are told he is dead, nobody really cries when they welcome him home again... The wife and kids seem to be happy all the time, they accepted it all very easily..."
4,Far From the Madding Crowd,Received DVD in good condition and fast delivery. The picture was interesting but was a bit long. I lost some interest toward the end of the film.
5,Unguarded is unparalleled,CLASSIC CLASSIC CLASSIC in every sense of the word! This album is a hallmark of Contemporary Christian Music.
4,So So book,"I really don't know what to say about this book. This book was just a rehash of what we already know from the various stars' memoirs. A lot of what he took was from Berry's book. He did reveal some things about Motown's business practices that were eye-openers. He also talks about what happened to flow and that whole situation was a crying shame. I found the parts about Hollywood Motown to be interesting. The failure of some of their movies just proves the point that everybody can't do everything.I did read this book, start to finish, in two days though."
4,Good quality but ...,"The HD 485 has a good sound, the low frequencies are very good, but for IPODs the cable it is too long, and the impedance it is a little high, so limit the volume level. It is light for the size; for the price I think it is a Good choice."
4,HD 485,Excellent for small device sound reproduction. Works well with my iPods and Macs. Worth then money.
3,Poor Customer Service From Sennheiser,The left ear crackles while listening to certain recording regardless of volume. Sennheiser will not respond to my requests for replacement. Certain recordings sound outstanding it is too bad I received a bum set of headphones I'm sure it is very rare to get a bad set but be prepared to be ignored if you do.
4,Good but not great.,"I liked it. Very good, but not off the charts . Not much more to say, so won't say more."
3,3 1/2 stars not up to snuff of precious two books,"I was really looking forward to reading Quill's story. I must say I had to struggle through finishing this book. I really didn't care for Gabby's character and if I had to read that she was plump or fat one more time I was going to scream. I am assuming from the way sophie said she was built much like her, that she was really just curvy like marilyn monroe but I was sick of hearing it said that she was fat. Also this is the second book that James insinuates that Peter is gay. We should all be adult readers, just come out and say it! I kept waiting for her to declare it to the readers but she never does. Also I found Lucien's love story holding my interest more so than Gabby and Quill's. I am glad I awaited the paperback and did not waste my money on the hardback. Since her 1st 2 novels were so great I will read her next one, but right now I am just disapointed with the story after awaiting it for so long."
4,Really Good Latin Pop,"This cd is really good, I seen their videos for the first time here in New YOrk on channel 41 unlivision like four years ago and always remembered them but never bought any cd by them, all of a sudden bam i bought all of them cause one after another they were soooo good, If you like Sentidos opuestos, Rebeca, Onda Vaselina, or other latin pop group you will like kabah."
4,Thank Goodness for this Book,"Thank you, Mrs. Backus! My Grandfather moved in with my Husband, son and me after his stroke and I thought I would have one next until I read your book. I was so tired of reading heart breaking and helpless accounts so when I found your book I was not optimistic. You gave me a fresh outlook and real life suggestions that have turned our world around. I thank you for sharing your experiences and your clever deeds. All family members of the chronically ill should read this!"
2,Don't waste your time.,"I guess Sennheiser assumed that only DJs would use these phones, in bass-heavy dance club environments, because they completely neglected the low-end response from the phones themselves. The mid-range (vocals, etc) sounds excellent, the highs are a tad bright, and the bass response is non-existent. If you listen to rock, dance, hip-hop (basically, any type of music with pronounced bass), you will hate these phones.On the plus side, I guess they are comfortable. Sennheiser should take the headband from these and use it to replace the horrible headband on the 280 Pros, which sound great but are horribly uncomfortable."
2,hmmmmm,I have not purchased the CD but listened to the one minute sample of the first etude opus ten. I am not a fanatic diehard stickler for technique but there were at least 30 or so mistakes/slips. This makes me reluctant to purchase the disc.
1,motor burnt on second use,I bought this thing a month before christmas and did not use it till about 2 weeks ago to shred carrots .First time it went well but a week later when I tried again smoke started coming out from the motor and it burnt.Hamilton Beach appliances are poorly built.I had similar fate with two blenders in the past.I would rather buy some other brand.Also clean up after the only time it worked was a nightmare.There is no rating below one starwhich I could use.
2,Not so pretty,"I really liked the author's first book, Daytime Drama, and was hoping for an even better read this time. However, Benbow seemed to have lifted the plot from his first book, changed the characters' names and gave it a new title. Readers looking for a great read dealing with soap operas and Hollywood should try Glamourpuss and Sex Toys of the Gods by Christian McLaughlin."
5,Sweat Enhancer,Excellent...I actually apply the product prior to putting on my neoprene shorts B4 workouts...It is excellent....It enduces the sweat during my workout as well as keeps my skin moisturized due to the neoprene material is comparatively to rubber...which can dry out skin...No issues now...great!
2,Albolene Is NOT a Moisturizing Cleanser,"I bought this product because it was described as a ""Moisturizing Cleanser"" which opens pores. This product is simply a mix of mineral oil and Vaseline. The label shows the first two contents as mineral oil and petrolatum. Once you have it on your skin it does not wash off with water. I attempted to wash my hands and the water just beaded up and rolled off the skin. It leaves the skin looking and feeling greasy because it's literally coated with petroleum jelly. Just buy Vaseline at the store and you'll have essentially the same product. Again this is NOT a moisturizer."
5,Were do i find this in a region 1 DVD?,Were can I find no retreat no surrender in a region 1 DVD? Must have and cannot find
2,"Okay, but certainly not worth the price",I purchased this book based on the reviews and I have to say I was disappointed. There is some decent material in the book but it was not worth the $79 I spent on it.
5,Good source for current information,"Taking a strictly evolutionary approach to sex differences this book offers a great summary to date (1998) with adequate references to a whole host of research. It takes this information and offers a summary chapter regarding sex differences in modern society that makes great use of the updated information and research to describe basic sex differences in social, cognitive, and interpersonal relationships today. This book is a good source for current information."
1,"Yeah, Right.","After reading this, read Angier's ""Woman"" to find the real biological nature of women.To quote Barbara Ehrenreich, ""Basing your answer on the [sexual] behavior of women in recent times is a little like studying giraffes in a zoo and concluding they can't run."""
3,If you like your books small.....,"....or compact, this series is for you. Basically the pix are post card size. which makes carrying, handling very easy. I don't think the quality of reproduction is the highest, but it is not bad. the greatness here of course lies in the images themselves, the broad overview of Evans' career, and a glimpse into a time gone by. useful essay to start with."
2,bizzy,"rent this movie first, bizzy bone was only in the first scene, mack 10 was only in 1 sceene also. It was okay"
5,Best cupcake book,"If you're looking for a cupcake-specific book, this is the one for you. I originally purchased it for myself and used it to make cupcakes for coworkers' birthdays and holidays and have gotten nothing but rave reviews, and have since given it as a much applauded gift to a few coworkers. This book is very easy to use, has pictures for almost every recipe- which is great for getting decorating tips, has recipes for every time of year and gives great suggestions for making ""new cupcakes"" out of some of the different recipes. All of that said, it's a great buy!"
2,dumb,"Another Troma trauma from the worls cheapest movie studio, a proundly dumb comedy that transfers the battle of the sexes to a softball field. Strictly for the couchbound whose remote controls are broken"
5,A must for any CD collection,"This CD is a must for any serious new music affictionado. The compositions on this exellent recording are proof that ""New Music"" is alive, well and in good hands. Ms. Moon's compositions are realized by a talented array of musicians that bring life to her pieces and the proof of her talent lies in every track. Add this CD to your collection and let it take you on a journey into what is timeles,great music."
1,2000 Acura Integra,"When 2000 Acura Integra is plugged into the ""does this fit my car"" at the top it lists the bulb as a low beam headlight... when it is actually a high beam headlight and will not plug into the low beam which is a 9006 i found out"
2,A superficial story with big holes in every part.,"I bought this book because I love personal stories and adventures. The author spends so much time on meaningless and small observations we never get to know her whacked-out husband, he seems a mere shadow. Although she was in an exotic locale, her experience seemed boring and I struggled through the book just so I could get my money's worth."
2,Sloppy edition,"The edition I had (Bibliobazaar) is so full of spelling mistakes (Eg. P:41, instead of ""Munster"", ""M; auunster"", and this repeated throughout the book) that I regretted not specifying a certain edition. I feel I got a very cheap edition for my money."
5,The Europeans,"The Europeans by Henry James. Published by MobileReference (mobi)Henry James is one of the best American writers. Reading this novel has made me very excited to read further works by James, as I plan to read the entirety of his literary output. It is the brilliance and charm of 'Europenas' that has instilled in me this excitment."
5,LOVE these!!,"We bought these after our children took swimming lessons at the YMCA and used these in his classes. They're wonderful!!! So much easier and less bulky than life jackets, giving kids enough buoyancy to keep their head above water but requiring them to do a little work. Great swim aid!!"
3,Good for the cost,This back float does not hold my 2.5 year old up completely. She is tall and thin for her age so maybe that has something to do with it. I hope as she learns to swim a bit more and keep her head up on her own it will be more useful. Right now using this combined with swimmies is what works for us.
4,IS it hot in here Doc?,"""Heartbreaker"" falls in the middle of this Lone Star Country Club series. Unlike the other books the information given here is not thrown in your face to make you read more. This book stands on its own. That being said a reader should definitely get there hands on the rest of the series.Heart Doctor Michael O'Day nearly runs over the feisty Prima Ballerina Susan Wainwright with his car. The Doctor loves nothing better then a feisty woman. Unfortunately her heart is weak, she needs the best doctor and that is Michael. The story is a sweet love affair, about an independent woman faced with her own immortality, and the thought of facing a new and different life and her Doctor who is madly and quickly blurring the lines of the Doctor Patient relationship.For those who have read the rest of the LSCC series you will see many a family face for those that this is a first try, I highly recommend giving the other residents of LSCC a try."
2,Better off avoiding Villa Lobos altogether,"Others have discussed the historical significance of this set...whatever. The performances here are amateur-ish; horribly out of tune, rhythmically-imprecise, out of sync with each other and utterly without any of the charm or lushness one might hope for from Villa Lobos. And the recording quality? Ungodly, even for the period. Don't waste your money...better yet, send me a few bucks and you can have my copy..."
2,Times have changed ....,"Since the CCIE R & S lab changed in January, lots of things in this book are no longer on the current exam. That includes Voice over IP, ATM, DLSW and ISDN. Given that most people don't have ATM switches or ISDN simulators in their home labs anyway, that makes a good bit of this book no longer relevent to exam prep. Pretty expensive renting an on-line rack to practice technologies not on the exam any more. It would be alot of work to re-write the labs yourself to take out the stuff no longer tested. For example, you could replace ATM pvcs with frame relay pvcs, but then you would need to redefine the solutions yourself,also."
4,Nice Anthology,This is a nice anthology of some of Amy's works. Not sure that they all play well together which is why the 4 instead of a 5. But if the compilation includes your favorites it is a must have.
1,CHEAP!,I guess you get what you pay for. These glasses provide a viscous glare on the inside of the lens that makes you worse off when you are wearing them. They are also made out of a super cheap plastic that feels like something you would get with a Halloween costume.Do not buy these glasses! They look cool but they will make you feel and look cheap.
5,Stand On Your Own,"A rich tapestry of a novel, Stand On Your Own is a remarkable, stunning work of romantic suspense. Intricate characterizations build a sympathetic heroine and mesmerizing hero that readers will love. Sit back and enjoy this intricately woven plot dipped in a relentlessly steamy romance."" --Denise A. Agnew, best selling author of BRIDGE THROUGH THE MIST"
3,Okay...,"I love Jon Bon Jovi, but this definitely isn't my favorite movie. It moves pretty slow and didn't hold my attention very well."
2,Misrepresented,"This does not have a swivelling belt clip. I've read the other reviews in which some reviewers try to correct some of the buyers who've complained of this. These reviewers have essentially told the complainers they aren't trying hard enough and the clips really do swivel. I absolutely, positively, unequivocally and without reservation 100% guarantee that the one I got does not and will not swivel. It cannot. It was not designed to swivel. If I try to force it to swivel it'll break, because it isn't meant to move that way. The clip has a simple spring-loaded hinge which does not swivel and never will."
4,Cell Phone Holster,Delivered the product fast and on time. The only complaint is they should show a side view so you can tell how thick the clip is.
3,Snug on a V400,The ratchet maintains position fairly well but the case is a bit snug on a Motorola V400.
2,Disappointed,"I ordered what I thought was a nicely illustrated book to accompany the CD of Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf I had ordered for my grandson. What I received was a teacher's guide with several very small paperback books in a plastic container. There was no mention in the listing that this was a teacher's guide. For the price I assumed it was a very nice book. Needless to say I returned it, ordered another but that was on back order. Grammy"
4,Cassette disappointing,"The artist does a very good job of illustrating the story & keeping the flavour of the Russian lifestyle. I was very disappointed that the audio cassette is only a narration of the story, and does not contain a recording of the symphony."
4,In Terms of Orchestral Works,"I bought this CD as a gift to my brother who I know would LOVE Wagner's music, but he won't go anywhere NEAR opera. For die hard opera and Wagner fans this is not the way to go, but for my brother and people like him who don't care for the singing, this is perfect. Although many apparently consider it a gross injustice to Wagner to cut fragments from his operas and throw them together, I was actually delighted when I came across this (and I adore his operas). These CDs allow a greater amount of people to enjoy Wagner's absolutely gorgeous music. The interpretation and balance of the orchestra is overall great. I'd say this was money very well spent and recommend it."
5,Outstanding Musicians & Witty Lyricists,"With so much wimpy junk being produced today, it's very refreshing to find a new release with so much musical talent combined with great lyrics... sometimes hilarious, sometimes inciteful and touching. I first heard these guys live at a Villa Montalvo concert this summer as the opening act for Chris Isaak. As much as I like Chris (a completely different style), I found I REALLY liked the Uninvited... so much that I pre-ordered the CD. Check it out. You won't be dissappointed!"
3,Just a Thought,One should read the original. Very surprised to find how much this was transformed in the theatrical versions. Not as intense as I suspected but a must read nonetheless.
1,WORST VIDEO EVER!!!!,I bought this video because of the recommendations of the other people. What were they thinking. This was by far the worst movie EVER!!! I used to think it was the movie Shaquille O'Neal made but this one takes the cake!!
4,Should have done better!,"With the budget and the largest set ""ever"" in British Columbia. Some !0 football field's over all. This film should have been a visual blockbuster. There could have been more camera angles to boast the expanse and isolation that DePalma was trying to get across. Some of the special effects were rotten and unrealistic. The great effects were ripped off of Kubrick's 2001."
4,"Overall entertaining, but missing something.","This movie starts out just like a 2010 version of Apollo 13 (Gary Sinise again), except the characters seem too modernized for the new millenium and are not written very well (characters are cliches). After all that, our brave crew leaves to rescue a stranded team on Mars. This is when the movie gets fun, with a lot of action scenes and some very tense moments. This movie is directed well, it definately pulls you in, unfortunately it spits you out at the end. In other words, the first 80% of the movie does a great job setting you up for the climax, but then we are let down by an unimaginative and unbelieveable, somewhat stupid ending. After it is all over, you may be sitting there unsatisfied, but most of the movie is still great, so it is overall pleasing. I believe this movie, however, will lose its flavor after repeated viewings.The DVD has some nice features, with an OK movie.Reccomended."
1,Words do not describe how bad this movie is.,"It's not even a mission to Mars. 10 minutes into the movie, they are on Mars, then a rescue mission to save the people. Bad acting, bad plot, bad story, bad ending. Some scenes try to pull on heart-strings, but only end up turning my gut. Avoid at all costs."
1,Just a silly movie,"Well, this one ranks probably as the worst movie I've seen this year, stupid plot, bad directingt... Dont bother"
5,An under-rated masterpiece !,"I'm somewhat perplexed with people's attitude to this film - it seems to have attracted an extremely negative response for no obvious reason. No - It's not a blam-blam Sci-Fi action blockbuster, but instead it's a film which portrays and depicts the emotion, heatbreak and loss that can inevitably occur when venturing into the unknown. M2M also shows us the remarkable concept of possibility thinking - something most people have yet to master. These themes are something not often seen in Sci-Fi, but M2M presents us with the best elements of 2001 & contact with a mystical presence. Granted, the film moves slowly, but in a deliberate and absorbing way. I can't imagine anyone comprehending this film who is not enlightened enough to see the true message. A timeless masterpiece."
2,Even worse than Red Planet,"The best sequence in the movie is the sandstorm. Everything else stunk. It tries to be thrilling by sequences such as the breached hull, but you always feel bored and never excited. The special effects are good up to a point, so why did the alien look less realistic than an episode of Transformers? One to avoid."
3,Martian Magic,"I have mixed feelings on this movie. Is it as awful as the one star's...I do not think so. Does it deserve 5 stars...hardly not. The real problem lies with the story and direction. Brian De Palma's overly large ego really got in the way of this movie. The cast has done about a s good of a job as possible given a poor script, and poor direction. As a sci-fi lover this is not the worst movie I have seen on the genre, but it does come close. Still, the visuals can hold some attention and the overall message of not being the only beings in the world, does point to some signs of hope. The script needed to be reworked (badly) and De Palmi never should have been allowed to direct...with the exception of Carrie, most of his direction has been a dismal flop....this is no exception. So, I give it 3 stars, for the casts attempt to salvage an awful script with ""some"" ethos and to over come De Palmi's horrible direction and action."
2,To bad the plot was not as good as the effects.,"The special effects were out of this world as well as the acting (although Jerry O'Connell did have a little problem with the dramatic crying scene at the end, ""don't get me wrong, I think he's a sweetheart""), it's just too bad there was no plot. This movie, considering it's budget, had great potential, but it was all show and no substance. It FIRST, begins when a space mission to Mars is lost under mysterious circumstances and another team is sent to find out what happend. THEN, (and this is the part I dont ""get"") once on the planet the plot 180's into something about aliens and human origin or something like that. It's just such a shame that the script was so shallow. I gave this movie a 2 because of the acting and special effects, but if you are looking for more than that, DONT WATCH."
2,"DVD doesn't play on Toshiba player, but plays on computer.","For some reason the version of enhanced DVD format they used doesn't play on my Toshiba DVD player. It, however, played on both my desktop and laptop computers, Compaq and Dell, respectively. I wonder if someone would know why this happens. If you do, please post your insight on this board.Thanks. A frustated consumer."
3,"Not nearly as bad as most say, but still misses the mark","A lot of nice special effects went into this movie as well as some very well respected actors. Unfortunately, the dialogue is terrible and the story seems to meander at times. However, there are a few moments when the movie does rise to the occasion, offering some scenes that are, at the very least, bold and challenging. For those, I give the movie three stars. The music was totally off, though. It sounded like it was intended for a polka than a sci-fi movie."
4,"Good film that works, but DON'T buy it.",The other reviews here tell the story. You may or may not like the story. The DVD is well done BUT it is programed so you must watch 10 min of junk up front. It locks my player (RCA) so it will not even respond to the stop button. The only way I can stop it is to eject it.
4,Great visual effects,"Don't get me wrong, Mission to Mars is not Oscar worthy material. But if you watch this movie the whole way through then you will leave with a feeling of awe and wonder. The special effects are just downright wonderful. If you can forget for just 1 second that the backgrounds and monsters are not real then the movie is a success. You start thinking, ""maybe that is what happened"" or ""maybe that will happen."" The acting is pretty good even though it could have been better considering who was in it. I also thought that adding a twist to one of the characters in the movie about 1/2 way through was ingenious. I do have to admit that when I rented Mission to Mars I was not giving it a chance to be half way decent because of it's PG rating. I thought that a space movie that's rated PG just can't be good. Well I was wrong. It could easily have been PG-13. If you want to be left in awe and in the mood for a space movie that is good for a change then rent Mission to Mars. 4 Stars"
4,Humanoids from the Deep,kicking sci-fi. thats how to make a movie without a computer. behind the scenes was a blast too.
1,It Sucks !,"Well just 2 words can describe this movie - it sucks ! The story sucks ! The acting sucks ! And some decent special effects can't save the movie. Wonders why is the movie made in the first place with such a script ! The audience really feels being taken for a ride, believe me. The final was a anti-climax, its not anything we come to expect, it like you would feel ""hmm just like that ? you mean I sit here for 2 stupid hours just for you to tell me that ? Its not help by some bad acting, cos u can really tell that its ""acting"". From the one expression stone face of the guy who lost his wife & the so unreal space couple. You'll regret if you ever seen this movie."
4,A very good intro to Liszt at a good price.,"Masur plays the best rendition of Hamlet available. He captures Liszt's intense musical portrait with full blooded emotion. The music weeps, sighs, moans and snaps into rage - all reflections of the tortured soul of Hamlet. Heroide Funebre also paints a dark and harsh portrait of War and the heroes that fall in the bloody process. Unlike Haitink, Masur plays it at the composer's correct tempo and reaches greater climaxes, revealing the brutality of War. The Nocturnal Procession is another masterpiece that unfortunately receives little attention in the concert hall yet you'll hear it here, played nicely along with a fine rendition of Hungaria. Other pieces like; Liszt's famous Faust Symphony, Prometheus and more are played with conviction. Even though these latter pieces receive better performances by other conductors this CD offers alot of great music at a great price."
1,Say What?,I must have missed something. If it were not for reading the synopsis of this movie it would be impossible to tell what the movie is about by merely watching it.
5,Simply FANG-tastic!!!!!!!!,"Being an FK fan to the core, even though I only recently discovered the show, I ran out and bought the CD without sampling it, just the theme music makes it worth buying!!! The vocals of Lori Yates are fantastic...still haven't decided which song is my fave, it's a toss up between the Hunger and Dark Side of the Glass. For anyone interested in listening to some spectacular music...GO BUY THIS CD!!!! You won't regret it!!! I think that Geraint Wyn Davies does a out-of-this-world job on the piano (Nick's Piano Theme has to be my fave piece of the whole CD)....and what can I say, I love Fred Mollin! I have listened to the CD non-stop, for weeks now, without tiring of it (I bet the rest of my collection feels neglected!!!) When can we get another CD from FK????!!! Please let it be soon!!! One truly satisfied customer."
5,The saddest movie ever,"This movie makes me genuinely sad. In Other movies when someone dies it is sad for a moment but then I realize it's just movie and that actor is still alive and I'm not as depressed. You can't do that with this movie, though, because Brandon Lee really did die and in such an easily avoidable way. It seems like this movie wanted to have that effect on you. All the messages really fit what really happened to him. This may upset some people but I found the movie sadder than Titanic. The Crow is also a great movie with good action and the setting is great."
1,Nothing to CROW about ...,"First of all, the commentary by ALEX PROYAS is NOT, I REPEAT NOT on this box set! Alex wants nothing to do with this set. Also, the so-called CROW CHRONICLES which was a behind the scenes amateur video shot by screenwriter DAVID SCHOW during filming will also NOT be on this set! This was a 90 minute video!!Why you ask? Well evidently Miramax did not secure the rights to the chronicles before it was advertised to be on this set. Smart huh? Why isn't Alex Proyas doing the commentary? That's simple too, he wants nothing to do with this box set and Miramax in all their wisdom failed to ask him if he would do it before they sent out the promo material.Now I ask you ... is this box set still worth the price of admission with the hour and a half Crow chronicles missing and the audio commentary by Alex Proyas, the film's director not on here? This is not too hard to figure out ..."
4,Everything anticipated,"Having already seen the movie in theaters and on VHS years ago, I already know The Crow was a great movie. Finally having the Bluray released this October, I was unable to purchase it locally. The picture was beautifully mastered. The interviews, particularly those with James O'Barr and the late Brandon Lee made some great Special Features.Had the item not been shipped in a mere flexi-bubble envelope, resulting a shattered jewel case, I would have rated five full stars. Luckily, there are third-party suppliers for replacement cases at minimal expense. It just sucks that I have to get one for a brand new product."
5,Best movie I have seen yet!,"I defintely recommend this one! It's the best movie i have ever seen! no more i can say, but just buy it!"
1,The Crow - Blu Ray,I would not purchase this item - hence I could not give it any star - it does not work in my blu ray player :(
3,an ok movie...,"This movie is your average mainstream blockbuster, one of the better ones out there. It would definitely get much less hype if B. Lee didn't pass away. But since we live in a society that praises the dead stars (eg Morrison, Cobain etc) much more then the living ones, the death of an artist is a huge sales booster of his work. The Crow is an enjoyable experience (although the soundtrack gets rather annoying at times) but it's nothing particularly memorable and late Mr. Lee is not a better actor then his father."
3,"Great Movie, but Bad Condition","I love the Crow, great movie and the like. But when I bought it, it said that the condition was ""Very Good."" They couldn't be further from the truth. The DVD is so scratched that I can't watch past the first 3 minutes. Even skipping chapters doesn't help!Again, I recommend the movie, but find a different distributor."
4,"""Quite a Bit Of Fun!""","No point in comparing Brandon to Bruce here - an interesting storyline in and of itself, a gratifying feeling as good triumphs over evil, pretty good effects.Brandon may be gone, but he could be proud of this work (and probably is)."
2,Comparable to Nosferatu or Brazil.,"I remember the day this movie entered my life. The story and visuals are paked with emotion. The music is stand alone. Some of the best by NIN, Thrill Kill Kult, STP, Violen Femmes, and the CURE. This movie Changed many lives. Even today I still see people mimicing ""The Crow"".However much like Nosferatu or brazil, its birth was amazing, original, and new. Today the film, with the skills of the late 80's, is lacking continuity, general acting abilities, and just plain keeping attention. The ideas are amazing, the script is not. This movie was very important in the 90's. Today it's locked away in the archieves of the past. Showing us once again that nothing will last forever...."
4,As Cool As Superheroes Can Get.,"I do not read comics so I have nver even seen a Crow comic book. I first heard of this movie when Brandon Lee's death was in the news. I was sort of sickened that they would even attempt to finish this movie without him.So I didn't jump the gun and see this movie in the theatres until very late. To my surprise it was a great movie that had an excellent cast, and an excellent soundtrack.Brandon Lee's scenes are moving, perhaps more so when in the back of your mind you know this was his last film. After seeing the finished product I feel it was well done in good taste.The DVD has nothing extra at all."
4,An tragic and beautiful story,"The Comic Book by O'Barr was his way of dealing with his own loss of his fiance`. The comic was much more dark and poetic, the movie however did it justice. Lee of course was not the best but he was at his best and no doubt would have gone on to do better."
5,viwer,"HE'S BACK FOR REVENGE! Brandon Lee RULE'S! ACTION PACKED, FUN, REAL COOL,and THE BEST!!!!!!!! Forget part 2 this is the one to watch! You HAVE TO GET this movie! THE CROW RULE'S!!!!!!!"
2,Promised to a Sheik,"I hardly ever write reviews, but felt I needed to say something about this book. The story of the Sheik and Cara was nice, but there is another story mixed in that has nothing to do with the story itself. The second story has no beginning and no end just random chapters about other people. Very confusing."
4,Super Sick.!,"Not bad, Not bad....But this edition uses the word 'power' instead of 'control'.the translation in general is a bit uneccesarily convoluted and not accurate compared to other versions ive read."
3,The Multi-Orgasmic Man: Sexual Secrets Every Man Should Know,"I haven't read this all and haven't had time to work through all the exercises. Nonetheless, I like what I have read and tried so far. I might give it a higher rating once I have worked through the whole book but for now 3 stars seems right."
4,This works,"The stuff in this book definately helps. It has no made me multi orgasmic, but my control and duration has definately increased. The exercises are worth the effort."
2,A lot of hooey,"This book may show you how to prevent premature ejaculation and how to strengthen you orgasms with Kegel exercises, but what they describe as multiple orgasms is simply coming very close to orgasm and then not going further, stopping, and then starting again. This may improve your sex life and the sex life of your partner but it is hardly orgasm - and may easily lead to sexual congestion in the male - which has another name. You may learn a few things from this book but don't expect to become a multi=orgasmic man,"
5,The Wicked Wit of Winston Churchill,Extremely well written and entertaining - much like the man himself! Well done!!! I would recommend it for reading to anyone.
4,Help myceliate our world,"I have read Mycelium Runing and I found it to be an inspiring read. Mr. Stamets goes into philosophies about the innate intelligence of mycelia and mushrooms and how we can befriend them and recruit them to restore our world and break down toxic chemicals. I think of fungal intelligence as chemical expertise. The fungi can figure out how to break down just about anything, including nerve gas and diesel. The book goes into how to start growing your own musrooms and to use them for restoration of damaged areas, as well as for re-establishing forests. I am a permaculturist, and this book is a very useful addition to my libraery of practical books with high information content."
5,Toby Stephens Shines,"This movie is a must see for all fans of Toby Stephens. I truly enjoyed every moment of this film. He is a very gifted actor who deserves much credit for his role in this film. Not only is his face handsome to look at, but his facial expressions convey such emotion in his character. This timeless tale unfolds with a gripping storyline and poignant tale of love found and lost. Don't miss this wonderful film!"
4,Review for Mr. M,"This movie was surprisingly much better than expected. The cast was overall really good with one exception. Gatsby was not portrayed well by Toby Stephens. After reading the book, I can say that Gatsby was not shown at his full potential. Paul Rudd did an excelent job of playing Nick Carraway. The plot was very close to that in the book, and the script was nearly identicle. The setting was good, although some of the set looked a little modern for the time period. Some parts went into more detail than the book, which is a nice surprise seeing that most movies do the opposite. All in all this was a great movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who has read the book."
4,It's better then the first.,"Considering the first attempt at the movie ""The Great Gatsby"" was a flop I had some skeptical feelings going into the movie. But I really liked it in the end. In the movie Gatsby, Toby Stephens, is an entrepreneur who is also chasing the girl that he lost so many years ago, Daisy, Mira Sorvino. All of a sudden an old friend of Daisy moves in Nick, Paul Rudd. Who just so happens to live right next to Gatsby. Coincidence? I think not. Thus the story begins with all the right chemistry to have someone die. And someone does in the end. Gatsby of course because how else could this story end someone had to loose.The performances were good although Mira Sorvino just didn't do it for me as the ditsy Daisy. Paul Rudd on the other hand did an excellent job as Nick. Music was great the story had a good flow and was easy and enjoyable to watch. I would watch it again. Hope this does it for you or at least Mr.M"
2,the best version was with alan ladd.nothing since has come near,each time a new version arrives i think back to alan ladd who was perfectas the great gatsby what on earth has happened to that film
4,The Great Gatsby (A&) (VHS),"Although we wanted the original movie with Redford, this version was very good and we enjoyed it, especially the outstanding acting job by Paul Rudd."
4,One of the best CD's of the year!,"A few years ago, Seven Mary Three set the standard for modern rock with American Standard. With the release of their third CD, Orange Ave., they continue to make their mark on Rock `n' Roll. If you are expecting a continuation of American Standard, you will be disappointed. If you like it new and fresh, this CD will take you to new limits with driving rock tracks and some powerful ballads. Hot tracks include ""Over Your Shoulder"", ""Chasing You"", ""Joliet"", and ""Blessing In Disguise."
4,Easier and more convenient,My ophthalmologist told me to take these to impede the development of macular degeneration. What's good about this particular brand is that the capsules are smaller than others and only two per day are needed instead of the usual four. Is it helping with my very early stage and symptom-less macular degeneration? I have no idea. Ask me again in ten years.
1,Excellent,"Product was recommended by my eye doctor. I really have no way of knowing if it is helping, but will continue taking it as long as my doctor recommends it."
5,Hope this works,"I purchased this item for my mother, after her doctor told her that she needs to get something for her macular degeneration. I can only hope it works and slowing down whatever she has. I don't know if that will work, but if it does, it will be worth whatever penny I paid for it."
5,This is a must see!,I was very impressed with the plot and film as a whole. Eric is awesome as the most recent Crow. Don't miss this one!
3,Less would be more,"Just as the public was treated to a spate of 3 hour movies last winter, along comes another thriller which would have been more thrilling had it been about 100 pages shorter. After all, how many murders, how many narrow escapes are necessary to make a book more of a page turner? I also missed a type of Holmes explaining the plot to Watson at the conclusion of the story. Too many names...too many agencies etc."
4,packs quite a punch in the songwriting department,An intoxicating blend of Brian Wilson-like vocals and Beatles-esque back beats. It packs quite a punch in the songwriting department for a mellow album.
3,Exquisitely written; disturbingly negative.,"It's hard to imagine a writer more capable of literally sucking you into the life of her protagonist, Ruth. Once you've turned a few pages, you're going to live it through til the bitter end. And a bitter end it is. Other readers speak of Ruth's subtle transformation in the last two chapters, but I found it ambiguous at best. What really bugged me about ""The Book of Ruth"" was the main character herself, who narrates her family's life story with amazing astuteness, but remains absolutely clueless about her own dreadful choices. Ruth's family is sour and [understandably] self-absorbed, but none of them measures up in abusiveness to her vapid husband, Ruby, whose unpredictable behavior Ruth overlooks and excuses until he inevitably erupts in a murdeous rage. Guaranteed to be thought-provoking!"
5,I really liked this book.,The Book of Ruth is one of the best books I have read this year. I really liked it because the voice was authentic. I felt like I had gotten to know Ruth and her family by the end of the book.
4,The Book of Ruth,"Overall I enjoyed Jane Hamilton's ""The Book of Ruth."" I enjoyed reading the story of Ruth's life and how she got to her dramatic situation in the end. Although I really enjoyed the ending of the book, I didn't like the beginning so much. At first, Ruth just continually tells stories about her childhood and skips around to different years of her life. It was hard to figure out what year of her life she was talking about, but eventually the book moved into chronological order, making it much easier to read. This book is a really fast read. As Ruth continues to tell her story, I feel how stressful and hard it was for her to grow up with her mother, May. All of Ruth's life her mother rejected her and made Ruth feel like she was nothing. The shocking ending was the best part of this book. After reading this book the only part I think of right away is the ending."
1,Can't believe Oprah liked/recommended this book,"I am going by memory as I read this book when it was first recommended.The greatest impression I got was how much abuse/torment/rejection was given to Ruth and othercharacters. Have no idea what she was trying to accomplish here and Icertainly did not like the book nor would I recommend it!Oprah, what were you thinking???"
3,Too much unnecessary violence!,"I didn't like reading this book. I'm glad I'm finished.What's the point???Young girl is born into a disastrous family,gets involved in a disastrous marriage. The only good thing she has to show for it is 2 sons. This was definitely a book of survival!!!"
4,"An overall good book, with some flaws","The Book of Ruth is gripping at times, yet predictable and unsupported other times. It was a relatively easy read, however there were times when I felt like putting the book down and not picking it up again. The references to religion to me seemed unrealistic. That this woman, Ruth, could not understand her own life, but could philosophize about religion. I felt that this book needed one final edit session. But overall, I still recommend reading it, if only to get a glimpse into a world many of us fortunately do not live in, but nevertheless encounter every day."
3,"for a ""word"" person","Not much of a plot, not much of a story, but I like how Jane Hamilton writes. If you listen to the lyrics of songs instead of the beat of them, you will like this book; if you are more into the music than you are the lyrics, you won't."
2,An irritating book with frustrating characters.,"For the first few chapters, the small town characters were genuinely interesting. I felt sympathy for both Ruth and her prodigy brother. While the family dysfunction was refreshingly honest, the book rapidly declined once Matt left and Ruby was introduced. The romance between Ruth and Ruby was unconvincing and Ruby's character was pathetically tedious. Ruth herself does not stay true to character, oscillating between personality extremes throughout the book. The author can't seem to decide if she is a strong, resourceful heroine and or a mentally challenged weakling. The violent ending is both infuriating and emotionally implausible. All in all, a disappointing read."
4,flawed but great for a book group,"Despite the presence of one member in our book group who hates reading anything Oprah selects, we read this book and had a great discussion about it. (Sometimes it's worth reading an imperfect book just because it provokes such a good discussion.) I loved the book but couldn't argue with the many criticisms -- mainly about motivation, behavior, etc. Despite the fact that I couldn't picture myself in this family's situation in any way, I had a gut-level response to the book. On the whole, I think Oprah picks better than most people do. She may lean a little toward the politically correct, but there is usually something gutsy to the books she picks."
1,Long and overwrought,"The popularity of this book is probably what happens when talk show hosts start telling people what to read -- and people are misguided enough to listen. This book was too long by half. The language and voice were not convincing, and the characters, despite an excess of description and plot, still managed to be one dimensional. The narrator's constant victimization is wearing rather than sympathetic. If you want to read a book that sets out to accomplish the same task, but accomplishes it with brevity, grace, and power, read Ellen Foster by Kaye Gibbons"
4,reality hurts,"""The Book of Ruth"" describes the life of a woman who loves someone with all her heart and soul, but then loses this love before she even has a chance to consummate it. Then she carries this loss around with her like an albatross, never rejoicing in life's joyful monumental events but instead knocks down any uprising of happiness and joy she encounters as she carries on her life marrying again and having children. She takes this loss out on Ruth, her only daughter, both physically and especially mentally, while she places her son Matt on a pedestal he feels is unwarranted. Matt escapes to college, and Ruth, the dumb one who has not a speck of self-confidence due to her mothers constant disparaging, is resigned to continue to live with her mother and submit to her mothers derilect treatment of herself. A well written dose of some peoples reality."
2,It was too violent and full of hatred.,"This book was very disturbing! The language was quite harsh, as was the emotional and physical abuse. In one particular case, the violence came to a head and was so full of evil and hatred that it was hard for me to forget. If you are of a sensitive nature, do not read. If not, then you have been desensitized to harsh brutality."
1,Horrible.,"This book is not a nice, relaxing read. It is not uplifting. I read the book after the Oprah review aired and now I wish I could see it again to find out what it was people liked about it. I am so relieved to read reviews on this page that agree with me. Not all, but some. How about a ""0 stars"" option? I have learned that Oprah and I do NOT have the same taste in books!"
2,Disturbing,"The book is ok, but I found many of the things Ruth did unbelievable. However if you watch Jerry Springer you may believe that people like this exist. I felt so sorry for Ruth, and in the end I didn't feel like she was ok. I don't mind a depressing book if it gives you a glimmer of hope at the end, but this one did not. Read this only if you want to be more depressed about life after it ends."
4,"Well written, but depressing!","What amazes me about Hamilton's writing is that she can take this mundane family, very much down-and-outers, and skillfully bring them to life with her terrific prose. For 90% of the book, nothing much happens, but thoughts and feelings are so eloquently expressed. The ending is bit flawed in that I feel cheated by not knowing what happens to the characters we grew to know so well as well as how life will turn out for Ruth's children. (I can see another related novel brewing!). Although this is a terrific read, the subject matter is not for everyone."
2,"Ok, but lacking in something","I would say this book was merely ""OK"". I found that I would force myself to read it to get it over with. The characters were hard to identify with - especially Ruth. I think it lacked in character development - and lacked any kind of identifiable reason for the behavior. Something just did not fit. I found the whole book was building and building up to a strange ending...which also seemed unfinished."
4,Late comer that really rocked,"Texas-based hard rock band Pariah released their debut, and only album in 1993. While we all know that 1993 was not conducive to most party rock bands, Pariah still managed to drop a kick-butt melodic rock record.This album is definitely a take on the hollywood scene of a few years past, hwoever, these guys put a southern Texas spin on their sound. This record is just a solid hard rocking effort the whole way through. It doesn't make you think they should have rivaled Poison, Warrant or Bon Jovi, but it is more than worth a listen. My favorite tracks are ""Anesthesia"", ""Do You Know How to Rock"" and ""Make Believe (Jesus Freak)"", but the rest is decent enough as well.If you dig bands like L.A. Guns, Ratt and Britny Fox, you'll wanna definitely check these guys out. The album is dirt cheap(and I mean that literally) so it won't break the bank vault, and you'll get some rocking 80's influenced tunes!"
5,Texas Best,"Pariah is an Austin Texas band who signed with Geffen records 6 months to late!While Pariah should have gone farther than they did,Geffen put all their energy into Guns and Roses.Not that G-n-R were a bad band,they got ALL the promo and time of Geffen,leaving REAL TALENT on the back burner.Pariah was that real talent!Sad as it is,after the CD was released,geffen dropped Pariah.Thay went back to Austin,where bassist Sims Ellison lost his love Rene Zelweger(a now famous movie star).The band split and all went on to do some cool stuff....But Austin and Pariahs fans were never the same.It's too bad !!!THEY ROCKED!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Lost and Found,"I bought this CD in 1993 at a used CD store for $1.99 (it still has the price tag on it). It was a promotional copy. I remember I liking it. This morning, I was going through my CDs looking for ""new"" stuff to load on my mp3 player and ran across this one. I was blown away! I had completely forgot how great this album is! Or perhaps I didn't appreciate it because I had yet to be exposed to all the latest crap. I agree with other reviewers here. These guys should have been really big."
3,Get me out of this prison!,"This came off as a made-for-tv-movie despite it having nudity and brief moments of gore (very brief, nothing nose-turning).ZDH was more cheesy than anything, but for John Saxon, it was worth a gander...the nosebleeds in this movie were amusing.Not much of a zombie movie, just dead guys walking after you, no gut-muching qualities about it...sorry.It's okay, a good addition to any zombie collection."
1,Not worth adding to your zombie movie collection,"The previous review that describes this as a made for TV movie is dead on right. It's in full screen format, and the only thing that makes it not a TV movie is the brief scenes of nudity. This movie could have been edited a little better in that you spend half the movie developing the main character...which could have taken easily 10-15 minutes instead. The emphasis of gay sex here and there they could have done away with. But above all, they should have put more of the budget into scenes with zombies in it. It's a great premise for a zombie movie, but it's just disappointing with what they did with it. If you're looking for rare movies to add to your zombie movie collection...you should seriously skip this one."
3,"Suggs takes the cake with ""I AM""","For some reason, your listing above claims track 4 is something by Iggy Pop -- it isn't. It's ""I AM"" by Suggs. It's the perfect song to listen to, on the road or while serving ice cream to a chihuahua. That's what I do."
1,get the right picture from the cover!,you have the wrong picture so I cannot even give it a review! please fix it!
4,Great alternative to long john's!,"These thermal capris are silky smooth, stretchy, and make me look great! Not itchy like long john's, and would be great for women or men. They are soo silky smooth on my legs, I just wish they had a little more stretch and a few more colors. Overall this is an excellent addition to your winter wardrobe!"
3,A little disappointed,"I am a big Brookmyre fan and was a little disappointed with his stab at a story set in the US. There Scottish connection is still there, with the main character a Scotsman, but the punch just wasn't there - which really is his trademark. Just read ""Quite Ugly One Morning"" and you will see. Don't get me wrong, I still liked the book, but it just wasn't up to his usual standard, that's all."
2,Coiled Bicycle Lock,"I purchased this lock when I purchased a Thule bicycle rack thinking that this would integrate with the rack. I was wrong. This lock is way over priced at $40 or so and a similar lock with a thicker cable for probably 1/3 of the price or less can be had from Onguard or Kryptonite.This is a typical key cable lock that gives minimal security. I purchased it to at least lock the bikes to our rack so they could not easily be lifted, all of course when we travel with our bikes and keep them in view. This lock is not meant for security as a cable cutter will easily cut through."
5,about the book,"Detective Doug Shearer has taken a few days off from work to fish a snook tournament with his girlfriend at Cabbage Key. On the second morning of the tournament, he is out in his boat at daybreak getting bait when he finds a body in the water. The victim turns out to be one of the most hated men from the fishing tournament. Detective Shearer ends his vacation early and assumes command of the murder investigation."
4,the breakthrough LP,"Although Sloan have gone on, within Canada at least, to bigger and better things, this is where the band really took off musically. This is a rawer sound that the better produced stuff of late so be forewarned. It's no grunge attack but it is sharper, crisper guitar playing than the poppy rock sound they now have."
2,Are you people joking?,"I rented this movie based upon the fact that so many people think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread! I guess a person can enjoy it if you simply want to sit down and not use the brain God gave you at all! Most of the time, I go for the suspense thrillers like What Lies Beneath, The Sixth Sense, The Others, ect. House of Wax is simply a slasher flick with really good special effects. This movie left much to be desired for me personally, but hey it's your call."
4,"Oh, my my my my! Yet Another Batch of Mutant Rednecks...","Whew! What a suprise. A v-e-r-y s--l--o--w beginning that suddenly makes a Right Turn (or is it a Wrong Turn) and becomes a redneck chainsaw movie, without that annoying saw noise. Paris Hilton isn't bad in this film kiddies, but she doesn't live too long. A film with genuine suspense, action, gore, and chills. Plenty of suprises around every corner. You never quite know where this is going, but the ride is awesome. Great special effects, a well written script, defined characters, and a dark menace throughout this one. Nothing to do with the Vincent Price 3-D classic, but that's ok. Its good to reinvent the wheel, and this one really rides well."
3,"Almost Got Four Stars, Just Have Fun With This One","Don't be expecting an original horror film and just sit down and expect to have a good time. The 45 minute build-up was rather slow, but once the first dude is killed off it really picks up the pace. This truly has some of the most gore of any horror film in recent memory and has a couple of memorable kills (the dragging decapitation and of course the pole through Miss Hilton's rich little head!). This is why we go to see horror films and I am glad the director had the guts to give us a true rated R film. The acting is pretty good overall, with Elisha Cuthbert being the obvious best of the bunch and believe it or not Paris Hilton does a good job playing scared. I will probably add this one to my DVD collection when it comes out, so if you liked the remakes of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Amityville Horror, or Dawn of the Dead you will want to catch House of Wax when you get a chance."
1,Violent and Gory,"Most people only bother to visit this site and write a product review when they loved the item. However, I wanted to give a warning to potential viewers. I wish someone had warned me before I spent my money! This movie is incredibly violent and gory. It doesn't give you a chance to turn away before something sickening happens. I'd love to be able to erase those images from my memory, now. I almost lost my lunch upon watching it. If that is your thing, you'll love this movie. If you're into suspense/thrillers and ""atmospheric creepiness"" like I am, be forewarned that you probably won't like this movie. I thought it would be like the Twilight Zone episode ""The After Hours"" (with the mannequins in the department store after closing time) and nothing could be further from the truth!!!! I thought ""House of Wax"" was awful."
3,Slow but better towards the end.,"Aside from what everyone else said the movie was really slow you had to get about an hour into the movie before anyone died. I skipped plenty of parts as to not waste all of my time and i didn't miss a beat of the action. The good part about the movie was that the bad people actually died and the black person wasn't the first to die. Also, the story was revealed and the white people weren't that clich'ed towards the end they actually opened their eyes and fought til the death. It was a great movie in the regards that everyone didn't die and the two fraternal twins worked together in the end. Lastly, even if they do come out with a sequel ,which I would doubt, because the third brother doesn't do wax, he picks up road kill it wouldn't hold up to audiences."
1,Where do I start...,"House of Wax is such a horrible remake of a classic film that it makes the also abysmal remakes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Amityville Horror look like Oscar nominees. The original film from way back in the 1950s was a classic but WHY THE FU** DOES THIS HAVE PARIS HILTON?!?! She's a dumbass and a complete idiot as it is but the fact that she's in horror movies makes me want to vomit! At least her character dies in the movie...MAKE THAT HAPPEN TO HER IN REAL LIFE!!! Chad Michael Murray is also a bad actor and an idiot. He sucked in that stupid show One Tree Hill and he's even worse in this pile! If you see this movie, it's a sin to quality. Watch the original instead even if it's in black and white."
3,A fun disterbing gory horror film,Reamkes are an in thing in hollywood right now there was the hit's Texas Chainsaw Masacree and Amytiville Horror and then there is this movie. Well this film did not do good in the theaters I think it would of done better if released by Halloween time. The film is actually pretty good it's not scary but more disterbing and Gory. The film has a slow begging but gets really creppy in the middle and then gets non stop running for the killers crazy. There was no jump scenes' but there was lots of oh my god and could not look parts. The acting was pretty good for a horror film i think Paris Hilton did good for a blond girl that is destend to die right when you see her. The visuals where very good and the direction was good. overall it was a fun disterbing gory horror film.
2,Puzzling movie!,"Unless you are a hard buff of this genre I really expect you do not watch this film. It is boring, capricious, with terrible taste, without a credible script and where the special effects are just the only merits. There is a homage to What ever happened to baby Jane? with Victor Buono and Bette Davis in the middle of the film.The film is just a sum of previous related movies as Halloween and the Fall of Usher and there is not point of comparing with the other version directed by Andre de Toth. At least in this other work, there was a script, the presence of Vincent Price and a master film maker.Please, don't waste your time in that mediocre film."
3,Good but not Great,"I wanted to see this movie ever since I saw the trailer. I wish it would have been better though. Once it finally picks up it moves along nicely, but the problem is is that it takes forever to pick up. All in all it should have been about 30 minutes shorter. A little more back story would have been nice, it wasn't really needed, but it would have been better than watching two sets of people wander around the town taking in the sites. I hate Paris Hilton, but she was tolerable through this one, I think because she didn't refer to anything as either ""hot"" or ""sexy"". If you are one of those people that jump whenever something surprises you then you'll have fun. I wish they would go back to old fashioned creepiness instead of the cheap scares though. It wasn't bad, but it definatly could have been better."
5,House of Wax Blu-Ray,"I really enjoyed this movie, kind of a guilty pleasure. The story is decent, the suspense is good, the acting is pretty good considering Paris Hilton is in it. It's not the scariest movie you have ever seen but its a very well made horror flick. I was very pleased to see that the transition from DVD to Blu-Ray went well. The movie looks great in High Def."
1,"No, actually minus 1","As a 57 year old who saw the 1st one,this is probably the worstmovie of all time.I ask one question..why did they let this be released? Nobody in the suits watched this first?If they had watched it,they would have hidden their faces with the wax.Not even the bad,bad,Ed Wood flicks(which actually I love)come close to this loser.Wow what a stinker. Bad music,bad script,bad acting.Stealing a fantastic old movies name. Now that's probably theworst thing of all.Kids,get the original. No nudity,swearing,horrible music..Just an oldfashioned thriller.Of course the cast is probably the worst assortment ofnon actorsyou could dig up.Well,I take that back.There was a good actor.The guy who played the third brother.However,I don't think he had do much acting. Remember the banjo player in Deliverance??Paris Hilton???????? Oh my gawd..honey this is not hot..even with the heat of the wax."
3,paris hilton in a re-do of vincent price,"add a little lust, Paris Hilton in red undies and a simply beautiful burning of the entire house of wax and you get a modern update of the old classic.lots more gore, the evil influence extends from the house to the whole little town. lots more cruelty and brutal deaths to stimulate jaded movie goers. plus a couple of decent surprises yield an cheap seats worthwhile movie, or a rental, or a bargain bin dvd buy. although i'm not sure i'd be interested in watching it twice.reasonable plot, cool underground lab, neat equipment and nice wax house make it a C+ horror movie...."
5,Great Slasher,Great movie. Good suspense and slasher scenes. I like cheesy movies like this because it is just plain funny and entertaining.
4,Quite terrific....,"... but I do have to be a a little bit of a critic here: Lovable as she is in her reality-series, Paris Hilton is a dead duck when she's posing as an actress... I almost cheered when her character vanished from the plot and her escape from the killer is like an out-take from ""Scary Movie"" 1999.The only actor worth mentioning is Chad Micahel Murray who is a beliveable anti-hero(and looks like a tough variation of Ryan Philippe).The real STARS are the plot and the effects:-)"
3,Not too bad,"Was this the scariest? No. The most interesting? No. I thought the wax people were creepy and cool in a sick way, so I guess that's why I gave it three stars. When they showed the one kid (thank god, because he couldn't act his way out of a paper bag) being turned into a wax figure, that was cool.I am by no means a Hilton fan...I can't stand that scank, actually. However, I don't know why people thought her acting brought the film down...her acting was just as bad as everyone else's. Her boyfriend in the movie sucked, Elisha Cuthbert's acting was horrid and waaaaaaay too overdramatic, and Chad Michael Murray was the only one with any semblance of acting skill. So, yeah, her acting sucked...but so did everyone else's.I would suggest this film over ""High Tension"", which I rented this week also and was a HUGE waste of time. House of Wax, sorry to say, was a whole lot better."
4,Delectably Disgusting!,"Well, the great dichotomy of my life is not being able to have my blood drawn or new piercings made without a near-passing-out experience occuring, yet I love these gory, bloody movies.Now, I only actually buy the things if they have scenes that actually make my stomach turn or add to my nightmares. Now that's a good movie to me, and this one is uniquely gross. All kinds of new ways to torture and kill hapless victims, and a Paris Hilton striptease down to her bra and panties. So, not the scariest movie in the genre, but different and stomach-turning!"
3,This was a perfectly good crummy movie,"We'll skip any of the acting, because realy, no one was any better or worse than anyone else. This is just a really, REALLY, poorly written movie. Good-ness. Who does these things? Camps by the side of the road, hitches a ride with a stranger, doesn't realize that no one is moving and the whole dang town is made of wax, on and on and on and on.You may have had a burning desire to yell ""Run!"" but if you were like me, you weren't sure who to tell. Not that I love to see people die (although there is always something great about death in a scary movie), but these kids were too stupid to live. To paraphrase Jessica Rabit though, ""They weren't bad, they were just written that way."""
3,"""The Kid""","This was a wonderfully crafted film aside from any attaempt at explaining how the ""kid"" managed to find himself in his own future. I found it to be particularly applicable to my own childhood and the often negative ways I found to deal with its after affects. I thoroughly recommend it!"
2,"Extremely silly, typical DISNEY production","I must recognize the fact that Willis gave his best and proved once and for all that he really can act in any time of movie. BUt this movie is boring, a chep Disney's catalogue product, with the same infernal soundtrack as always, a ""funny""kid developed to catch the audience's emotion and all the custumary cliches from this studio. The story's idea isn't bad, but the execution is constrained in a clear attempt to pleasure all the ages."
1,Sorry but I can't agree,"This story has been done dozens of times over the centuries -- the hardened, cynical adult looks back over their life and has an epiphany. Stories like this and Dicken's ""Christmas Carol"" seem to me to drag the audience through a lot only to get them to an ending which we all know -- bad guy turns good. I much prefer the twist versions of the story, like ""Harold and Maude"" and ""It's A Wonderful Life"", wherein the protagonist is a more likeable character who comes to see how much they are liked and valued by others in the world. Saw this on a plane and I'm sure that hurt it a little but honestly I hated this movie."
3,Heartwarming but NOT Hillarious!,"This movie was NOT the rip-roaring comedy I thought it was going to be! So if you expect to buy this movie and laugh all the way through it, you will probably be disappointed. The plot, which involves a 40 year old Image Consultant (Willis) who meets his eight year old self, seems to try a BIT hard to TUG AT YOUR HEART STRINGS. Yes, the film definitely is attempting to manipulate your emotions - which, I guess is what all movies attempt to do - only the effort seems really noticable and transparent in this one! It's cute; it's clean, it's wholesome, family viewing, but (I hate to say it) it's just not anything special! My opinion: DEFINITELY RENT BEFORE BUYING! (Sorry, Bruce)!"
1,Don't try to learn anything from this book,"This may be a great book if you already know everything about finance. I've taken MBA level Finance courses, and quite honestly, I found this book difficult to understand. The author casually mentions financial concepts without defining them and expect you to understand complex financial theories he hasn't covered.I tried to do the questions at the end of each chapter, and while there is an answer guide, it does nothing to explain how the answer was derived. How you get the answer is the important part, but this text won't give you any assistance. Plus, some of the answers were just plain wrong (I checked with several experts).There are better texts out there - your time is better spent elsewhere."
2,Sorry but who sings the songs is as important as the songs,The conductor and the singers can make a beautiful song the opera that everyone jeers and hates. To have a Russian singer doing o mio babbino caro is just plain silly...give the woman a break and play something from Russian opera...give a beautiful melodic aria to a lyrical singer like Caballe...boo hiss. Try Opera's Greatest Moments where they give Hvorostvsky an aria from Pique Dame and leave the bel canto to bel canto singers.
2,Very Disappointed,"To be fair, I usually do not like opera--hurts my ears.I bought this cd because it has the only aria I have ever really liked on it: Un Bel Di from Madame Butterfly. I heard this on tv years ago and was completely mesmerized by it and have been searching to buy it ever since. This was my 2nd try, and 2nd enormous let down. The sopranos voice is awful--way to high to capture the rapture of the aria. I wish I knew who the woman was who sang it on tv, I think it was a commercial for cars. That was a beautiful rendition."
5,Great Design!,Diamond and Baratta are two of my favorite Designers! This book displays the ecclectic environments they help their clients create!
3,A great browser and wish book,The Diamond-Baretta Design book gives braided rugs a great outing. Being a longtime braider it does my heart good to see Jan Jurta's great rugs showcased in such a fine manner. The colors and decor are exciting and let us know that braided rugs will fit in a lot of different venues and don't necessarily have to be dark and country.Recommended if you are planning an expensive redecorating project or if you're just dreaming you can afford it.
1,HIDEOUS!,Terrible. Don't even think about it. It's like Hanson on acid. Unlistenable. Unspeakable trash. Worse than Pearl Jam. I didn't much care for it.
1,I give this cd 1 star because i feel like it,"First of all this is my all time favorite cd (I think its better than nevermind). I also think you should buy it. The lyrics don't really make a lot of sense But also i Think they never were really supposed to make sense at all. its also why nirvana has simple guitar riffs and simple drumming. Nirvana i think is a band that used that to convey The way they thaught of themselves and the world ,that nothing really matters. And that i dea that nothing reallly matters, life sucks, anti government, punk rock type stuffs is why i am giving 1 star because chanses are no one will read my review, and if you do, take my recomendation and buy this cd. 1 more thing i have the cd nirvana and its a waste of money."
4,I like it...,"I really enjoyed this disc. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I felt a few songs sounded rushed and sort of alike. But I kind of like ""tourette's"" because of its punkiness and how my parents couldn't understand the song or the lyrics. Explicit lyrics? Nope. Except a few scrambled words in the booklet for no apperant reason. Gross picture, maybe. ""Rape Me,"" I guess. But it doesn't deserve to say EXPLICIT LYRICS on it."
4,Simple but Intriguingly Provocative,"This and Nevermind are my two favorite Nirvana albums. Kurt Cobain's lyrics are the most mature and brilliant in this album. The constant metaphors related to the body and medicine are reminiscent of great poets like Jim Morrison and Roger Waters. Even Cobain's guitar playing slightly improved in songs like Serve the Servants (and the b-side Moist Vagina). Though songs like Rape Me and Pennyroyal Tea are disappointing in the simplicity of their structure, songs like Radio Friendly Unit Shifter, All Apologies, and Milk It provide much more complex and interesting guitar riffs. Heart-Shaped Box and Scentless Apprentice are two of my favorite songs, and even though they are simple, they are better than Cobain pounding away on power chords like Tourette's and Nevermind's Drain You. Simple and limited, this is no Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness."
5,Attain NIRVANA,"From the first couple of seconds of ""Serve the Servants"" you can tell this album is not the radio-friendly, unit-shifting piece that Nevermind was. In interviews with the band about the release of this album, you can see Kurt almost gleefully proclaiming how this album will make Nirvana lose some of their cheerleader-jock Nevermind fan base. So, if you want poppy melodies mixed with noise (almost White Light/White Heat level) this is for you. I think most Nirvana fans think that this is the greatest Nirvana album. ""Scentless Apprentice"" is what I think of when I think of Nirvana. ""Heart-Shaped Box"" is pop enough, but also beautiful. ""Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle"" ""Dumb"" and ""Pennyroyal Tea"" are all favorites, and ""Radio-Friendly Unit Shifter"" will annoy most anyone much to your pleasure. ""All Apologies"" is one of the Greatest Nirvana songs written, one of the greatest songs ever. Even Sinead O'connor can't screw it up. Just get it!"
5,Return To Grunge Roots,"Using the same formula which made 'Bleach' so appealing, Nirvana returned from world wide fame with their third studio album - and by far their best. The raw power of each individual track is overwhelming at times, and the favourites are plain to see.'Radio Friendly Unit Shifter', which mocks the popularity of 'Teen Spirit' and other radio-friendly music, is by far my favourite grunge track from the album. In terms of emotional, thoughtful tracks, it has to be a competition between 'Heart-shaped Box' and 'Pennyroyal Tea'. A hard choice as both of these tracks are beautiful played and the lyrics are simply stunning.In his wisdom, Cobain saves the best till last with 'All Apologies', a wonderfully catchy song dedicated to his wife and daughter.One can't help wondering what gems Nirvana could have served up had Cobain felt the will to continue his life. A classic album, and the rougher side to an excellent partnership with 'Nevermind'."
4,In utero - Nirvana - Nuff said,Ok..I'm probably biased since i feel nirvana are one of thebest groups in history but hear me out. The entire album has qualitysongs from end to end and honestly while i dont think it's the bestnirvana work it's got some amazing songs(my personal favorites arerape me and heart shaped box). If you are anyway into rock music atall this album is for you.
5,Nirvana at their best,"Personally I like this album better than Nevermind. The production on Nevermind was too clean. Steve Albini did a good job on this album: it gave Nirvana a rougher, harsher sound. Get this album now!"
1,Kurt Cobain was a genious ?,"If he was he didn't show it in his music, poor musical structure, bad lyrics, ugly sound. Nothing interesting in this cd.If you are very frustrated about society and you feel rejected, try to get some help with a professionnal. This music won't lift you up !"
3,"Not bad,not great either!","Some of the songs are actually great(Frances farmer,Pennyroyal Tea),but the album it's far from being great!The poduction is weak,a couple of songs are,in my opinion,impossible to listen(Such as Scentless Aprentice,Tourette's),and this cd i'sn't DEFINITLY for Nirvana first time listeners!If you are going to get this because you liked Nevermind or Unplugged In NY,don't bother!I like Bleach better and this can't match Nevermind!Still worth having,though!"
5,Underrated,"Hard to tell you how good this album is. Its raw, emotional and unconventional. Nevermind is nearly perfect and maybe their best album, but In Utero is probably the record Cobain wanted to make."
1,"this is a great record,....","i like this record and i would have given it at least 4 stars,but shagrath slagged immortal,so i can only dive 1 star,..it's a pity,.."
2,BUY FOR ALL TID,"This is an overproduced, cluttered, and noisy (in a bad way) piece of hot monkey dung. If you don't have the albums ""Stormblast"" or ""For All Tid"" do yourself a favor and buy those instead. Those are epic Black Metal recordings from a band that was once good. Too bad they sold out like Emperor. Now excuse me while I go listen to Graveland."
5,An inspiring collection,"Most breakfast cookbooks are top-heavy with variations on the usual: lots of waffles, omelets, home fries, and muffins. This one is unique, because it collects a set of recipes you *wouldn't* have thought up on your own.For instance, it's the only book in which I've found a recipe for goldenrod eggs (hard boiled eggs in a cream sauce, served over toast, with grated egg yolks and paprika sprinkled on top) except for a 1942 WWII-era pamphlet my mom had. It's the only recipe I've found for dutch baby pancakes -- sort of a cross between a pancake and a sweetened popover, traditionally served with lemon and maybe a sprinkling of confectioner's sugar.Aside from completeness, the recipes are clearly written, entertaining (with sidebars that include breakfast menus from, say, a 1904 hotel menu), and educational.I have at least three or four breakfast cookbooks. This is the only one I use regularly."
3,Gets boring,"My daughter got Simba for her 3rd birthday. She asked for him and is pretty happy with him. However, he says only 6 things and seems to respond to your answers, but after a while even my three year old got bored and only muttered the same answers to his same questions. She actually asked us to turn him off and plays with him like a stuffed animal instead of an interactive toy. She does play with him, though. He just did not meet our expectations."
3,Not worth leaving Jen for,Great shootout Choreography. Falls into the battling relationship catagory of Tracey/Hepburn movies or the TV show moonlighting with Bruce Willis and Cybil Shepard. Very unrealistic- neither one gets hit after 2 million rounds of gunfire. Also unrealistic are her lips which stand out more than the acting.
1,STUPID STUPID STUPID,"Ok first of all there are so many things wrong with this movie. Lets start with the idea of the movie. HORRIBLE. You dont have crazy killers liveing in the same house. Dumb ok. Ok then we have the catch phrases. Like when they are fighting, Brad says whos your dady. Then Angelina kicks him out of jelousy and totally steals his catch phrase, she just adds a now to it. Then they blow up there house cause there dumb. The worst part was when they were in that gunfight full of people. They got those super body armors. Not one of those F***ing idiots thought about shooting them in the head. COME ON MAN, its a no brainer. Shot them in the head and POOOOOOOOOOOOOOOFFFFF, problem done. Thats why i give this movie 1 bullet wound out of 5.(P.S. if you want action and greatness, i suggest the pest.)"
2,bad version of 'prizzi's honor',this movie is so bad that i simply couldn't finish it. why this movie would be remade to renew the old 'prizzi's honor' is beyond my wits. this movie was just dumb and childish. totally ridiculous and shallow.
3,Average film,"Typical, derivitive, Hollywood action flick. Lots of action, short on plot, mediocre acting, predictable. Rent before buying!"
4,Full of Action,"Hmmmmmmm....Angelina & Brad have extremely good chemistry!!!This movie was really good, and the action was non-stop. At times, comical."
1,Pretty people....but not much else.,"Beautiful people to watch, lots of action and violence (if that's what you enjoy), but a disappointing screenplay and a somewhat incoherent plot. As two married assassins who are ignorant about each other's profession, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are a good match, with lots of chemistry (obviously!), but this film doesn't do much for either of them. The story had great potential, but wasn't written nearly as well as it could have been. Despite Angelina's outstanding beauty, my husband walked out in the middle of the movie! I stuck it out to the bitter end, but was very disappointed with the ending. If you like a film with some substance, don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,"Bland, bland, bland","Jolie and Pitt look great, but have zero chemistry in this insipid, overlong action-comedy. I wasn't looking for a masterwork when I sat down to watch this, but I definitely wasn't expecting something so uninspired and bland. Not fun, just dull."
1,why can't this be released once,"what is with these unrated and newly found clips releases, I'm not going to buy another copy of this movie for a ending that was left on the floor and now a studio wants to release another version...Can I trade my old version for this one? Is there a trade-up option from the studio? Get it right the first time please![reveiew for Mr. & Mrs. Smith - Unrated (2-Disc Collector's Edition) not the original widescreen release version, as the movie was good even with the cut scenes that made it on the first DVD release...]"
3,Drop the Love,A average movie. The suspense stuffs is just OK. I could have like it better without the love and hate stuffs.
1,Simply a rip off,"This movie is terrible. I am insulted that I paid real money to see this. When you have two actors as great as Brad and Angelina, a movie should not possibly be able to go wrong but this one did. If we could talk to Brad Pitt, he would probably say he is ashamed of this and to please forget he was ever in this movie. Save your money."
1,Worst movie I have seen in years,"I suspect my 1 star rating is the exception but this movie was simply awful. Had it been a total spoof like Airplane, it may have been okay. But since the movie had a dumb story and way too much violence, it was more like a Saturday morning cartoon with bad acting. I am sure glad the rental fee was only one dollar. It was worth less than a buck, unfortunately."
4,The New War of the Roses*,"Mr. & Mrs. Smith is as awesome action twist on the War of the Rose's. If you like The Rose's, you'll love The Smith's. Lots of great action shots in the making of this movie... and then there's Angelina Jolie. Need I say more?"
4,WOW! Hilarious!,"Wow, when i went to the theater i didn't know what to expect from this movie. i thought it was mostly going to be action-packed but i was surprised at how funny the movie was. Brad Pitt was surprisingly funny and he played his part well. Angelina Jolie was great as well. I've never seen any hotter actors together in a movie before, and both Brad and Angelina were definitely the main ingredients. When you watch the movie you can just see the sizzle coming out of the screen!! they were great and had amazing amazing chemistry. If you want to see a fun movie that has action and comedy combined, i recommend this movie. ENJOY!!!!"
1,Amazon dropped the connection,"Unfortunately, we were not able to watch the movie, but rather repeatedly got a statement saying there were technical problems, and we should try again later. Amazon charged us anyway.... not a lot of money wasted, but a frustrating experience."
5,Cool Beans,I like Mr. and Mrs. Smith and this was a good buy. This video is of good quality and I would recommend this for all PSP owners.
2,It went on and on...,"...I thought it would never end. The movie is somewhat entertaining in places but the scene where they are trying to kill each other bothered me. Domestic violence is not funny. At one point he is putting the boots to her, then a few minutes later they are in each others' arms. Some may say that it is just a movie but in our crime-ridden city we don't need to glorify the life of a hitman."
3,a great idea that could have used more touching up,"Whether or not you're a fan of Pitt and/or Jolie, this movie is worth renting. The concept of a married couple who know nothing of each other's past nor what each other really does for a living provides great suspense. It turns out that both work as secret agents or even assassins who eventually are assigned to kill each other. The plot gets interesting up to this point but viewers upon watching this will learn why I didn't give this movie a fourth or fifth star. Everything was pretty much good up until the last portion of the movie. That is to say, the script became weak up to that point. Overall, the film still holds your interest and I can't say it isn't worth renting. Just don't expect it to be oscar material."
1,Is everyone serious? This movie was garbage!,"I can't believe the reviews I'm reading about this movie, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Boring plot, ridiculous action and corny dialogue! I fell asleep watching this and wanted my money back for sitting through this crap, I think the only reason people watch this is because of the star power that was involved and the whole break up and Brad and Jen, This movie was ridiculous! Common on people back me up."
1,Mr . and Mrs. BORING,"From the Land of Boredom comes the best Boredom has to offer this year: No story, ridiculous script, no acting. Will someone please put this movie out of its misery!"
5,Rusty Math Book,"Everyday Math for Everyday Life could serve as a perfect stand-in for a math tutor! Mark Ryan's mathematic expertise coupled with a desire to help others is evident as he offers refreshing instruction to those of us with rusty math skill. Subtle humor splashed the pages while I learned to tackle seemingly complex situations involving math in my daily life. Never again will I fear helping children with math homework, nor will I avoid conversations involving finance or insurance. I might have overlooked it had I not been led to it during a math course, and for that I'm grateful, because it will hold center stage in my library from now on and should be the math book of choice for any average person as an invaluable resource of basic formulas and fundamental math concepts. Compared to other math books I've look through, this one is the easiest to read and follow. My conclusion is that everyone should have had a math instructor like Mr. Ryan. Owning his book is the next best thing."
2,I am so disappointed!,"I have Cabin Fever and Thanks for the ether and a few others and i was really upset. This CD kinda...blew. I mean, The songs aren't very creative like the other ones... and what is up with that little girl singing? The playrites werent as good as Cabin FEvers (the Exclusive Celebrity Double Date). The tune and rhythum was okay, but it really wasn't good. The voice is stronger, but the songs are bad. It didn't catch my ear like CAbin Fever did. I would not reccomend this CD to ANYONE who has heard RAsputina before and new fans. It is not one of there best work."
1,just looking to complain about Amazon.com...,"advertised: Limited Edition w/Bonus Discshipped: regular version sans Bonus DIscremedy: Amazon sends you ANOTHER regular version and asks you to pls return the first regular version (!!)judgement: they do NOT read emails; they just funnel you into standard pre-determined ""Ways to Resolve General Types of Complaints"" w/no interest in actually helping...Jeff Bezos, is you is or is you ain't listening?"
4,"WendyandLisa, of course","The movie is good but the music is spectacular, fresh and provocative. The standouts are Wendy and Lisa, Enya, and Grace Jones (gulp!) I cannot listed to Closing of the Year enough, does anyone know where I can get the CD single of this gem? I have heard the extended version and it is better!"
3,Burke makes the rounds,"Burke Devlin suspects that Bill Malloy's death was not an accident, and takes it upon himself to interrogate some suspects. This does not make the sheriff very happy, and it certainly does not make Matthew Morgan very happy, who attacks Devlin at the Blue Whale.Following their (separate) confrontations with the disagreeable Mr. Devlin, Sam Evans and Roger Collins have a little discussion of their own at the Blue Whale.A bonus interview with Louis Edmonds (Roger Collins) concludes the tape. This is typical 60s soap opera stuff, with little to recommend it if you're not already invested in these characters."
1,Too Highly Dyed,"My lovebird was instantly attracted to this toy with the colorful balls and silver bells and fun arch design which swings freely, but soon after he started playing with it I noticed the colors from the balls started coming off all over his beak. Looked like he had just eaten a bright blue snow cone. I decided to see if I could rinse off some of the color dye from the toy but as soon as this toy was immersed in water, not only did massive amounts of dye leach from the product, but all the balls began to unravel. I certainly wouldn't recommend this product to bird owners, and from now on I will be looking for better made toys that contain less dye."
1,Item delivered is not in good condition and is missing a bell.,"The item received was missing one bell on one end of the arch. Some of the vine balls are also frayed. Utterly disappointed with the condition of the product.Super Bird Creations 7-1/2 by 7-1/2-Inch Vine Ball Arch Bird Toy, Small"
1,A Benchley Bomb,"Having enjoyed nearly all of Peter Benchley's work, I was excited when I noticed that a new novel, 'Amazon', was available. What an incredible disappointment 'Amazon' turned out to be. The novel seemed to be written at the level of a young reader. The story line was flat and unexciting. The book dragged on and on, frequently repetitive and completely lacking credibility. As others have mentioned, the book was loaded with misspellings and words out of context. I suggest the author use a proofreader rather than a spell-checker. This one's headed for the trash bin!"
1,Long & Lame,"... It didn't really have a plot. And the ending was abrupt & unsatisfying. (by the time I was halfway through reading this book, I kept hoping the ending would somehow redeem it). Anachronisms & typos abound, and it was completely unbelievable. The characters were either stereotypical and/or completely one-dimensional. It had a promising premise, but nothing ever happened. ..."
4,Moves right along...,"This is definitely one of those books you read to escape into. It is very fast-paced, full of action and adventure. Not a think piece. Just a great ""escape"" book. It has shipwrecks, pirates, kidnappings, mystical adventures, lust, and fierce rivalries. What more could you ask for in an escape from your everyday world?"
3,Too depressing and scary,"While the acting is great is great and the theme relevant, the story was too depressing. I'm not saying this story should not have been told but I would never buy it."
2,Really slow and limited to a tale of an internet predator.,"Painfully slow story. Good actors but, this is a difficult movie to watch unless you have nothing else to do and nothing else to watch.Hard to believe that there is anyone alive today who doesn't already know the story. From the time the teenager first goes on the internet, one immediately knows the rest of the movie.Perhaps this movie should be shown to pre-teeners at an educational or after-school program but, this is not a suspensful or rewarding movie to watch.Only skilled acting brings a one-star movie up to a two star."
2,slow and unresolved...,"great acting but hated the ending. well i agree that this is good for parents, however, as a movie buff, i really disliked this movie because it didn't go anywhere. it was just sad and depressing. if you're going to rent it anyway, be prepared to see a family deal with a horrible traumatic experience that will go unresolved. if you are a person that likes closure, then this isn't for you. again, no complaints on the acting. clive owen gives a raw and emotional performance. if you prefer something with more of a twist to the online chatting older man meets younger girl, then i definitely recommend the movie Hard Candy."
4,Trust......not,"This was an interesting movie. I do like Clive Owens, it was a fantastic twist to something that is happening as we speak."
2,"""A Must See!"".......What?!?","I don't know what quality and content those who rated this movie a ""must see"" are used to, but this movie drags on and on, without resolving any of the irritating frustrations it develops in its own plot. By the end of the movie, absolutely nothing, except for a very precious relationship, is resolved. I don't know where all the surprise twists and three steps for one are that have been mentioned, but I definitely didn't see them in this movie. There was one surprise card in the whole movie, and they played it twice!!!! The film quality was fine, and there are some real emotions strung throughout the movie, but they aren't developed enough. Scenes cut right when emotions surge and everyone is going in different directions throughout the whole movie. The subject matter is without a doubt vital, but this movie doesn't do it real justice for the way a young girl would truly feel immediately after going through a circumstance like this. Very drug out"
3,Not the Best in the Bunch,"While I generally regard any video that encourages sign with childrena good thing, I have to say that I just don't think this one is one of the best. I've seen the foreign language tapes in this series and they are awsome. If only this tape followed the same succesful approach. True, there are many signs taught but the pace is just too slow. There is too much time spent on single words - over and over again. My little ones were bored after the first few minutes. My advise is speed it up. Children learn rapidly. Don't expect a child to sit still for this tape."
5,great way to learn signs,I and some friends are learning signs and this little video has really been a help to us. Its good for kids and adults alike.
4,Totally Alice....,Great show - great theatrics. The 16:9 widescreen version is quite good. Unfortunately - the DTS and Dolby digital soundtracks are 5.0. That is such a waste - no bass. If your surround receiver allows - select DD-2.0 and listen to it in DTS Neo-mode or Pro Logic. It will expand the soundfield and sound much better. If your an Alice fan - buy this... The bonus CD is a nice addition for the road.
5,ALICE IS THE MAN!!!,"Alice Cooper Brutally Live is the best concert DVD out there!No other artist can get a crowd into a show like he can.I recently saw his Dragontown tour and was totally blown away.It was the most entertaining and exhilarating time of my life!The fact that he is 53 and still performing in front of SOLD OUT crowds for over 2 hours is mind boggling!Brutally Live has all of Alice's classic hits plus more new great material of his CD Brutal Planet.If you are not hooked on Alice by the time you have finished watching this, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?????The first time i saw Alice Cooper i was 5 years old watching the Muppet Show.His onstage antics and great music make him perhaps the greatest performer to ever grace the stage.Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD!!!!"
5,AC Pulls it off in style only Alice can,"Great DVD of a highly charged concert from 2000. The energy AC and his band show in this concert is tremendous. DVD is filmed as if you are attending the concert rather than the terrrible follow-up DVD of AC live at Montreux where the 4 second shots make your head spin. Sound is great, camera angles are great, band is great. It is a winner! One DVD I would definitely purchase for my collection."
3,disappointing sound quality,"I bought this DVD today and was really looking forward to watching it as we don't get much chance to see Alice Cooper in a live performance. Picture is excellent, however the music (no matter what setting I put it on)always drowns out the lyrics.Had to play the CD in order to really enjoy the performance. Good thing I bought it in a ""bargain bin"" or I'd really be p.o-ed!! I did NOT purchase this thru Amazon."
4,A New Kind Of Country,"I'd heard a lot of different things about the Handsome Family before I bought this album. I have to say that it isn't nearly as weird or different as people had made it out to be. This album shows that great country music doesn't have to sound like the Carter Family or Garth Brooks. Some of the songs are a little different (e.g. ""Big Bad Wolf"" and ""Happy Harvest"") but that only makes this record more enjoyable."
2,Not very interesting.,This book was not very interesting. All of it except for one or two parts were dumb. I would not recommend this book to readers. Sometimes I felt it was a waste of time. That was the dumbest strange matter book I have ever read. IT WAS CRAP! BY JAREL
2,Leaks from hot water reservoir,"I've owned three Bunn coffemakers. Two each of the original B10 series and one of the BTX thermal designs.After approx. three years of use, each unit developed a leak from the top water reservoir. These leaks ranged from a few drops to flooding the countertop, but alway from the top reservoir.When they work, they're great, but I've had it with this design issue. I'm going to buy a true commercial coffee maker, which for all the money I've spent on these three, I could have bought to begin with."
2,"Great Coffee, But Poor Carafe","I've had this coffeemaker for a couple of months now. I'm experiencing the same issue with the carafe spilling as the other reviewers have. For a $150 coffee pot, I'm very disappointed in the poor quality of the carafe. I'm glad I did some research before I ordered another carafe, considering another reviewer did the same and got a new carafe with the same problems. The quality of the coffee is fantastic, but it's really annoying to have to poor a cup of coffee out over the sink because the pot drips all over the place."
3,Bunn Coffee Pot,Was not happy the pot it self was not the one on the photo. Hope it holds up to a bunch of firemen
5,Inconsistent Results,"I purchased this item wanting a coffee maker that would make coffee hot enough to go into my thermos so I can take it to work. I followed the setup directions and tried to use it. The coffee is inconsistent in flavor at best. I use Starbuck's ground coffee and it is fine in the Mr. Coffee I own, just not as hot as I would like. In the Bunn it is weak one time and too strong the next. I notified the seller and they sent me a second with the same results. It seems like the water goes through so fast it does not have time to extract the coffee flavor leaving it weak and tasteless.I will be sending it back.UPDATE: I have been using this for sometime now and as long as you grind the coffee very fine and use a few more grounds than one might like,it makes great coffee. Always very hot. I purchased a Kitchenaid bean grinder which works superbly and makes a very consistent fine ground coffee for use in the bunn coffee maker."
4,Bunn coffee brewer,"I liked my original Bunn coffee maker better, but alas, it was at least a dozen years old, and finally gave up the ghost. This one's just fine, and at least it has a stainless steel carafe. It keeps the coffee nice and hot, but I don't feel like it holds as much as my first Bunn did. That's okay, though, stainless steel carafes never wear out, and I use my original one as a backup when needed. All in all, I'm a big fan of the Bunn coffee brewers, especially after checking out a good many of the competitors."
2,Keeps your coffee hot for a long time!,"I have always liked Bunn brand coffeemakers. The last Bunn coffeemaker I owned lasted almost 12 years and still worked, but the hotplate died and the coffee cooled off quickly. When I discovered the thermal carafe model, I decided this was the way to go. Even after several hours the coffee is still warm and fresh since there is no hotplate. If you are a serious coffee lover, this is the coffee maker for you!"
3,I've had better Bunns!,This Bunn makes coffee fast as they all do. I have had the commercial Bunn pots before and wish I had one again instead of this one. The thermo pot is ok but it is difficult to get it to pour that last cup easily. 10 cups is really 4. Have to use the pot to fill the water and to keep coffee hot have to rinse the pot with hot water before perking. It is just ok. I am not sure it is worth the money. Shipping was fast and product was well packed.
2,Dribbles more than a point guard...,"This would be a perfect coffee maker if the pot didn't leak - NO gush - NO HEMORRAGE coffee each and EVERY time you try to pour a cup. The speed of a Bunn has never been questioned, the quality of what is in the cup is great and the idea to eliminate the ""warmer/burner/fire-starter"" was genius. However! The design of the pot itself is about as bad as ""New Coke"", BetaMax and Lawn Darts rolled together."
3,Thermal carafe leaks,"Makes good coffee fast, but I have the same complaint about the dribbling carafe. You have to pour coffee into a cup over the sink; the leak is terrible."
3,Was hoping for a better product!!!,"I was so thrilled to see that Bunn came out with something to keep coffee HOT!!! We have always used a Bunn, so when we saw this I said I gotta have it. We always made coffee an my husband put it in the thermos so it would be hot when I got up. We thought this is great we don't have to do this anymore. WRONG!!! The coffee gets made about5:30 in the morning and is never hot by 9:00 in the morning. I always have to nuke it in the morning. I think that Bunn should re-design a new stainless steel pot. Was really disappointed this time Bunn. Brenda Williams"
4,Great Coffee Brewer,"This is my second brewer of this exact model. This thermal-carafe is far superior to the previous carafe. The old model dripped/leaked etc... with every pour. This model is much improved (no drips, no leaks) and I am very happy. Also, this new carafe, keeps the coffee hot much longer than the previous carafe model. As always, the BUNN maker is fast and makes an excellent cup of coffee."
3,Too many leaks and warm coffee.,"I bought this unit over four years ago. The fast brew is its only saving grace. The drippy thermal pot showed up immediately. I tried the cleaning ""fix"". It did not work. Everytime I contacted Bunn they sent me another carafe. I now have four. They all leak. As someone else mentioned, it's due to a poor spout design.A few months ago the whole brewer began to leak. Hot water comes out from under the top. It leaks when it's sitting idle, it leaks when it brews. Somedays it's OK.I searching for another brand. Too bad! We have found that the expensive appliances are never worth the money. The lowly Regal does just fine!"
4,Good Product,"This is the 3rd Bunn coffee maker we've had. Very good product. The only questionable thig about this product is that it has always had a ""hot smell"" to it. Maybe just being new or the materials it is manufactured with. Would recommend this product."
1,"New meaning to ""drip coffee""!!",Does anyone ever actually TEST their products anymore? The stainless steel insulated carafes for the Bunn coffee makers are a JOKE! Be sure to grap a handful of napkins or paper towels to mop up the spilled coffee.How can a company that has been making coffee makers this long put out a product this bad? Unbelievable!
5,Ran a B&B with This model,"Our Bunn BTX-B just died this week, but what a life it lived! We bought our original Bunn when we bought our B&B; in Maine in 2004. The original had a small defect and two years later Bunn replaced it with a new model. That one lasted for four more years!Now think about it, from 2004-2008 this coffee maker was making on average about 4-8 pots a day! And because Bunn stands behind its product, and we got a replacement, we were able to have six full years of mega-use from our very first purchase.If you love coffee, this is the machine for you. Its designed for residential use (not B&Bs;) but it managed to crank out pot after pot without complaint.We are out of the B&B; business now, but we are sticking with the Bunn BTX-B, and I am placing my order for the new one today.Our old Bunn will get a proper burial."
5,Bunn Coffee Pot,"Excellent service, fast, prompt and item was economically priced. Would order again from this store."
3,Just point your finger and say BANG,"Either that was one tiny town or everyone not on the hit list sure knew where to hide! And I'm not entirely certain why they needed an extra constable in the first place, especially one who can't keep track of his gun. Regardless, not bad, if not a little too obvious, action flick. It doesn't quite rise to classic status. Not really a western either. It was okay. I wouldn't bother watching it a second time though. Lovely vistas, I will give it that, kudos to the cinematographer."
4,Modern Western with a nod to the classics,"I was a little skeptical about Red Hill as most of the straight to video newer westerns that I haven seen have disappointed me greatly due to poor production quality, bad acting, and badly written scripts.Red Hill is not your typical western, as it is set in modern day Australia however in small old west type of town. The law in the town of Red Hill did someone wrong some years ago and put him away (jail), well he has escaped and returns to the town of Red Hill for his revenge.I won't give anything more away on the film.It really was enjoyable however.For those of you that avoid movies with bad language, this does have some. Not a lot, however. I think I counted around 5 uses of the ""F Word"". There is no nudity or anything along those lines.Check it out."
2,a big mistake,"Don't misunderstand me: I'm a great fan of Chet Baker's playing; I even think he was miles ahead Miles (no pun intended). But this CD, as well as the Chet Baker with Strings CD, is a big mistake. The reason is that he does not solo the entire melodic line of the songs; he shares it with the strings. And we didn't pay to hear a Frank Pourcel-like rendition of the songs. Even Bobby Hackett, when he recorded with Jackie Gleason's strings, played the whole melodic linesof the songs, and so did Parker and Clifford Brown in their with strings albums. So this is a frustrating CD. It looks like a tyro who couldn't play the whole of the song and had to rely on the strings tohelp him out."
4,Entertaining and informative.,"I've been gardening for many years (actually, my garden survives in spite of me, not because of me), and I found a lot of new and useful information in this book. It's a little ""cutesy"" but that makes reading it more fun. I'm re-reading it to try to absorb more of the information."
3,What Did I Expect?,"I love Mike McGrath's public radio show, so I guess I shouldn't have been shocked that his book is written EXACTLY in his voice - from abrupt changes in font sizes to Jersey-fied spelling of words, the book reads like something he dictated and captures his quirky style. More pamphlet than reference guide, you'll find some good advice and helpful reminders in here, but since the book's composition is rather stream-of-consciousness, arm yourself with page flags if you ever want to refer to those gems again. All in all, I'm glad to have this on the bookshelf, but I wouldn't rely on it for an education in tomato growing."
5,NO SMALL ALBUM,"This album is great. No words can describe Amazing Grace. Buying the album will be well worth your money.Actually, this is not Essik's first album. Being from Birmingham I have had the opportunity to see him many times. He has quite a few albums out and they are all wonderful. Each year he plays at City Stages, a music festival in Birmingham that encompasses over 250 acts in one weekend."
4,"Cute ""tan"" baby boy doll","My son is half-Indian, half-white. I wanted to find not only a baby boy doll, but one that is somewhat close to his skin tone. This baby doll is the closest I found, and overall we've been happy with it. It's very soft and cute. My son (who will be 2 this summer) loves opening and attempting to close the velcro closure on the doll's shirt. He has a group of several stuffed toys that he likes, and this one is on his heavy rotation.I wish the baby doll's diaper didn't keep riding downward no matter what we do. It would be a bonus if the baby was somewhat anatomically correct in the genitalia, but again, we can deal with the fact that it's not. In addition to the doll's appearance being very cute and soft, I also like that it's reasonably priced compared to the alternatives.Overall, this is a very cute little mid-skin-tone boy doll for a reasonable price."
5,Perfect Buddy,"My son received this baby boy doll for his first birthday. I hoped it would help teach him to be gentler. For the first few months, he seemed to actively dislike the baby doll. Whenever I would put the doll in the playpen or crib with him or even hand it to him, he would immediately throw it across the room. As time went on, he liked the doll more and more - first touching his nose and belly button and then progressing to taking off the baby's shirt and diaper. At 15 months old, my son now LOVES this doll and is very gentle with him. He thinks it's hysterical when I change the doll's diaper and I pretend like the doll is too wiggly (just like my son is!). My son likes to give the doll kisses and he hugs the doll as he gets ready to for bed and continues to hold him when I lay them both down in the crib."
5,Wonderful story about good friends,"I won this book in a drawing and had no idea the jewel I now had in my hand. Once I began this story I could not put it down because I became so entwined into the lives of these friends who became acquainted in college. This book mirrors the relationships so many of us have in our own lives---creating friendships, losing contact for a while, and rebonding later. These relationships are part of who we are and continue to be important to us. The beautiful friendships, acceptance of others, and how each of us perceive the ""role"" others have in our friendship are examined. I had never thought much about this until I read this book."
5,Works for class.,Received book quickly and in the condition I expected I will purchase from this seller again.
1,HORRIBLE!!!,This book is a HORRIBLE read!!!! I wouldnt attempt it unless you want to fall asleep!!! Its sooooo far from real it makes me want to scream!!! I cant even finish it im half way through and its going to the used bookstore as a trade so i can hopefully get something better!! Dont waste your time!!!
1,Kindle edition is a mess,"The book itself was good, but I couldn't get past the repeated typos in the text. There were points in the story that s$$$j was a word, and it wasn't just once. It was awful. I returned the kindle edition and sucked it up and got the paperback version at a local bookstore."
1,the beggining of the end for Goth's supergirl,"This record should never have been made, and neither should have the one that came out after it ""The Rapture"", or anthing by the Creatures, for that matter. It's a shame that she tarnished the memory of the wonderful music she made in the 80's with this unimaginative c-grade pop. Please, buy Hyena or Juju or Dreamhouse instead."
3,Not Their Best,"I hate to give such a low rating to this album - I really like the band a lot. However, as another rater put it, the album lacks depth. The album is almost completely absent of hooks. 'Scars' was a really good album, but this one is lacking. It's a shame, because I was expecting something great from this band.However, if the band is coming to your area, and you can get the CD at a cheap price - buy it, listen to it, and go to the show. You'll love it. These guys are great in concert.So, other than the title song, there's not much too this album - but then again, maybe it will grow on me. My overall suggestion - I'd recommend this album if you are already a Soil fan and can get it at a decent price. If this is your first purchase of Soil material - forget it. You'll wear out the song 'Redefine'quickly and then will probably forget you even own the CD.Honest as I can be..."
5,Great guide for the Peloponnese,"This is a really good guide for travel in the Peloponnese. It covers the history of each place,where to eat or where to stay. It will be of particular interest if you want to follow the classical history of the area and the myths and legends. This aspect makes it good bedtime reading as well. A really great buy for me."
2,Love the Roots with Jimmy Fallon ... HATE rap!,This is not the fault of the Roots. I just didn't realize this disc would be rap! AAAArrrrrggggg! 'nough said.
1,BAD,Worst directing and acting I've seen in a long time in a Hwood movie. The main actor shoud be doing industrial videos for the Navy instead.
2,Sound out of sync with video,"It's a $200 camera so I wasn't expecting much but I was actually impressed with the picture quality of the 1080 and 720 settings. The 720 60fps setting looked great and had fluid movement. The only thing I didn't like was that the recorded sound was about 1/2 second of ahead of the video. That matters when someone is talking to the camera. The still camera took bad pictures too, kind've blurry on the sides. I didn't buy it for it's still camera quality though, I probably never would have used it.I returned the camera though. Overall, if the sound would have been in sync it would have been 5 stars because it really takes nice video, vivid colors, autofocus seemed to work fine, crisp HD picture."
4,"Good, cheap camcorder","Length:: 0:52 MinsThe video quality is pretty good given the cost. It's been a nice addition to my backpack. It starts up quickly and is ready to take a photo or video at a moment's notice. The only two complaints I have is regarding the microphone and the battery. The internal microphone is terrible. If there is a lot of background noise or you're recording a loud event, there is a lot of distortion in the soundtrack. Also, I ended up upgrading the battery toone with more amperage. Since then I've had no issues with charging or battery drain while the camera is not in use. Here's a sample video from the camera. NOTE: It was shot in 720p, but Amazon re-encodes to a much lower quality."
2,From Back Cover,"Bent on destroying her powerful family, someone had abducted pampered Casey McKee and stashed her deep in the snowy Oregon wilds. Only one man could possibly save her: ruthless tracker Sloan Redhawk.The brooding cowboy swiftly hunted Casey down - and the headstrong heiress made the blood sing anew in his icy loner's heart. But Redhawk knew evil still stalked the mighty McKees, and Casey remained an all-too-tempting target. For a killer as well as a cowboy...Third in the Love Letters series"
5,Its the best fantasy compliation ever.,"While there is gore and violence, it is not the over-riding factor in the story of Drizzt. Heroic deeds and family bonds (although surogate) mainly contribute to the nature of a drow lengend."
5,R.A. Salvatore at his BEST!,"This was the first R.A. Salvatore novel I ever read. (Yes i started reading book three first. not sure why but i did) Drizzt's odyssey through the physcial world and mentally through the drow elf's mind's eye is deep, complex, and brilliantly written. The inner conflect within Drizzt is real and convincing. R.A. Salvatore writes a vivid adventure with strong character development and epic action scenes as adeptly as any author out there today. After reading this one I immediatly went out and bought book one to find out how the series started. I am now on book 7 of the Drizzt series and loving every page. This is perhaps the best novel i have ever read! I finished it in only four days. A must read! 5 stars!"
5,WARNING AFTER READING THIS BOOK YOU WILL BE HOOKED!,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. And I have read hundreds and hundreds. Salvatore writes incredible battle scenes, and creates characters you love and characters you thoroughly hate. This was the first of his books I read and afterwards I had to read the entire series(10 books so far with another by different author soon). Must read for fantasy or AD&D fan"
5,This book was great!,This book was definitely better than the others even though the others were great also. The whole trilogy was probably the best series of books I have ever read. Yet this one was definitely the best. I learned about this trilogy from a friend who wanted me to read and I got hooked on them in a second. I am now on the Icewind Dale Trilogy which is as well awesome. I think I am gonna read all the Forgotten Realms I can.
5,WOW,"This book was amazing...I read the first two and this one was by far the best of the series. Drizzt is so well portrayed in this novel that you can't help but want to like him. He undegoes countless problems in this story including some we face today...racial discrimination. I think that if you havn't read this book you are missing out on a jewl. No matter what type of book genre you are into everyone who reads this GREAT book will leave it having laughed, cried and been on the edge of their seat. (I cried because it was over)"
5,MAY DRIZZT RULE THE FANTASY WORLD FOREVER AND EVER AMEN!,"This is by far the best book (or triligy) ever created by anything ever! I'm starting to believe that this was actually created by God almighty himself, in R.A. Salvatore form! Only such a being could have created such real and awesome characters, Drizzt and Guenhwyvar. He tells the story masterfully, with stunning battle scenes and captivizing characters, which i've come to admire. This is the only perfect triligy i've ever read. PERFECT! ABSOLUTELY THE BEST! Bob (or God), please never EVER stop writing about Drizzt! No matter what Corona world you write about, it may be almost as good, but people won't worship you like they do for this series! Anyway, this is by far the best book ever, no questions asked! Ask anyone, they'll agree. Drizzt rules! Woohoo!"
4,Singly one of the best books I have read!,"R.A. Salvatore weaves one of the most fantastic stories I have ever read! He takes us into a dark elf's world and shows us the trials the dark elf goes through, just to be accepted by the world. The dark elf, Drizzt, is noble and but, grossly misunderstood by the surface world. The friends Drizzt makes are for a life-time. With the heart of a ranger and the strength of a lion, Drizzt leaves his past behind and lives for the future.I'd recommend this book to anyone who loves to read a well-written book."
5,A series that will make you think before you judge.,"The story of Drizzet Do'Urden is a must for any fan of fantasy right after ""Lord of the Rings"". It will make you think about the people and surroundings around you before you judge them. For those of you that don't have a strong belief in religion this series of books will give you a view on religion that is extrodinary."
1,WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE????,"Forget Tolkien! Screw E.R. Eddison, Mervyn Peake, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and T.H. White! THIS unseemly work is the TRUE fantasy epic of our time! A cliché pastiche? Nah. Elves, Dwarves, mithril coats STOLEN from Tolkien? Oh poopoo. SCREW all those other writers who actually took the time to create their OWN creative artifice and hone their OWN literary talents! This horrid, lackadaisical tour-de-force is what people really want! Long live mediocrity! Long live Dumb&Dumb."
3,Makes you think,"Written at a time when it was trendy to debunk the revolution, it still makes the reader consider what had been taught at irrefutable in grammar school. Roberts takes the extreme opposite position of the Arundel and Rabble in Arms books and the truth is somewhere in between. If you like the quintessentially American tradition of building up our heroes then cutting them down to size, you'll like this book. I reccomend the earlier ones though because he uses the same formulas here but more effectively in the others."
2,Excited at first but very disappointed in the end,"I have read all of Kathleen E. Woodiwiss novels, my favourite being 'the Wolf and the Dove'. She has since been my favourite author and I did buy every new book that came out here of hers. I was very excited when this book came out as I had been waiting for nearly two years over here for a new book! I read the summary of the story and thought it had great potential but was deeply disappointed in the end. The story turned out to be light fluff with no development of the main characters inner passions or personality. Has she lost the touch, I now wonder, and now will peruse the next book very carefully before buying. I hope the old passionate sparks come back soon!"
3,o.k. but not great,"Petals on the River was not a bad book but it was certainly not the best written by Kathleen E. Woodiwiss. The two main characters tend to gush over each other WAY too much and that gets really boring really fast but it had a semi-decent story to it. I would recommend reading the Flame and the Flower, A Rose in Winter and the Wolf and the Dove first. The stories are better and the characters aren't as annoying. Read this one after those only if you have nothing better to do."
4,An Excellent Read,I thought this was a good book. I couldn't put it down once I started reading this book. I really liked the plot and characters. Woodiwiss kept me guessing until the end. The love the characters developed for each other was very romantic. They were able to overcome the rumors and make a wonderful life for each other. I would highly recommend this book to a friend. This was the first book I have read from her and I would definitely read more.
1,"Predictable plot, bad prose","Kathleen Woodiweiss seems to believe that, despite the fact that this book has no plot development, if she simply puts in enough attempts on the life of her heroine the story will be exciting. Unfortunately, this isn't true. Instead, the story simply becomes preposterous. If that weren't enough, Woodiwiss' prose soon becomes painful. Not only is her sentence structure embarassingly incorrect, her language never rises above buzzwords and cliches. Nobody loves a child when they can ""nurture"" him, nobody talks when they can ""communicate"" and her attempts to give a colonial flavor to the language never rise above substituting 'tis for it's. All in all, a wonderful example of how not to write fiction."
1,Waste of time,"Received this book as a gift, and was looking forward to reading it. Hadn't read a book by this author for quite some time. Thoroughly disappointing. Too much money for so little content. Too predictable. Is she now writing down to a different clientele?"
2,Disappointingly formulaic love story.,"I have always enjoyed reading Kathleen Woodiwiss's books. Unfortunately, I cannot say that about her latest, ""Petals on the River."" I think what it lacks is sexual tension between the main characters, Shemaine and Gage. I believe sexual tension between the hero and heroine has been one of the primary forces of her books. In this story, there is practically none, and it takes over 300 pages before the main characters make love. I, too, have skipped over chunks of the book I found to be boring. And why did she wait until the last couple of chapters to introduce the Beauchamps? I believe they would have enlivened the book if they had appeared sooner."
1,Do not waste your money or time!,"This book isn't remotely worth the high price tag. I would rather read a Harlequin Romance novel by Tara Taylor Quinn for romance, intrigue and above all a PLOT LINE! Kathleen, get back to your sweeping epics with heroic warriors and strong fiesty heroines! I still love ""A Rose In Winter"" and ""The Flame and The Flower"" but will borrow any future books from now on to save from bitter disappointment if this is your new style of writing."
3,very touching,The love shared between the main characters is very touching.It doesn't start off very well but picks up later and turns out to be quite entertaining.
2,What a disappointment!,I have always loved Kathleen Woodiwiss and when I saw this I snapped it up and I have to say it was a waste of my time! This didn't even read like it was written by her. Very poorly written. It was like watching a bad B movie. Rather than letting the plot unfold in interesting ways the story teller has the characters telling the plot in excruciating detail. Felt like I was reading something written by a first-timmer. I will be cautious of here stuff in the future. If really want to read it - borrow it - don't waste good money on it!
1,"Boring, boring, boring","This was the worst Woodiwiss I have ever read. I really enjoyed her first few novels, and was kept spellbound by them. I have not outgrown Woodiwiss, as I still occasionally re-read her older novels, and still enjoy them. This novel was severely lacking. To me, the characters were cardboard, the storyline very ho-hum. The publishers had to buy this one on name recognition alone. This is the second Woodiwiss I was sorely disappointed with, and has taught me to never again purchase a book of hers without at least reading the first chapter. If I would have done this, I would have saved my money! Doesn't her publisher have readers who pre-read these books before they decide to publish?? I think I will pack my copy up and send it back to them demanding a refund. Sorry Kathleen, but the price was steep and the quality was sorely lacking."
5,Songs and Prayers from Taize: Keyboard Accompaniment,"If you are serious about using Taize chants as prayer responses in your worship services (how we got started), or as the basis of entire services of worship,prayer, and healing, this is the book you want. Music for C-Instruments (recorders, oboe, flute, violin, cello) is all interchangeable, and B-flat trumpet music can be used for any B-flat instrument(clarinet,etc.) The keyboard accompaniment is basic, and can be used by musicians to help create different accompaniments for harp, autoharp, guitar, lute, etc. Chord names are also given that help your more advanced musicians create parts of their own. A marvelous resource; a must-have for doing this music at any level."
4,Targets,"These are great for rifle or pistol, I wish they were self stick, but that is what they make electicial tape for."
5,More then the Basic,"I purchased this book while in Wyoming when I first started taking Landscape Photos, and this book gives you more information then most College level books, I have taken some great photos using Mr Lange Book and if you want to take some great shots I would suggest purchasing it for your libary."
3,Elementary book with too much info that will become outdated,"This book contains a lot of history and developments on Internet advertising that is very introductory. Too much detail is provided. Zeff's ""Advertising on the Internet"" book contains similar info and is more interesting and much easier to read."
3,"Good service, but not the right operas","I was just getting into opera and it is a decent opera, but it wasn't what I had expected. The service was very good, but like I said, it just wasn't the right operas for me."
4,it's a classic,"Good cd, it has it's high points and low points... most cd's do. This one introduced me to one of my favorite bands, BABYLAND. High points are BABYLAND, Diatribe, Virus 23, Xorcist, etc. Reconstriction records was my favorite label because of good fun cd's like this one, I wish they were still around. Anyways, if you haven't heard it you should have by now! Get with it!Discover who BABYLAND is while you're at it!!"
2,Not that great!,"I love industrial music and lots of electronic for the last 10 years I have been collecting and this cd was a big fat dissapointment.I don't really reccomend it but you have to give it to them for trying and I'm sure some of the bands on this recording are desent,but it's really not worth it. sacha is the only thing going for this album."
3,Not his greatest book,"Check the copywrite date. He has a giant book on Ghosts that already include these stories-In this book, they are not necessarily his best or most recognisible tales. It is a repackaged book from the 60's. He has better books on the market- I gave mine away after I thumbed through it, not realizing that I had read these stories in another text."
5,Cute =),"Had the product for probably half a year, and still no problem with it. I don't think it's meant to be handled roughly but I just use it as a clip around the strap of my handbag so it sits inside my purse nicely and allows me quick access to my phone. No problems as of yet with the strap or the hinges."
4,Fun with fabrics,This is an enjoyable book to try something new and not just traditional piecing. It was fun to try something different. It is like playing.
5,A Must-Have for Any Quilt Lover!,"Although I'm not really into ""art"" quilts, this book is totally awesome! The quilts are beautiful, and Ricky's hilarious writing style is worth the price of admission alone. The techniques are thoroughly explained, and detailed photos accompany each step. I was amazed at what you can accomplish with one small piece of fabric! I have over 500 quilting books, and this is one of my favorites. You definitely won't regret buying this one!"
2,What was he thinking?,"This was a great idea for a story. Great potential for theme and plot, etc. But the execution didn't even come close to living up to that potential. The author rambles on and on re-empasizing the same points over and over again, trying to show a theme. The plot is pretty good except that it trails off and the ending is very poor. It is very good about 2/3 through and then it becomes worthless.Now for the incredible ""what was he thinking?"" part: the lack of editing. I can't even beleive how sloppy this book is. There are misspelling and errors all over, and in a few parts there are crazy typos such as the letter ""b"" being in the middle of a sentence. What is up with that? If you're going to take the time to write and publish a book, edit it for god's sake! My guess is this thing took a couple dozen hours to write and wasn't even read though, let alone fully edited, after the writing process was done."
1,"I wanted buy the book but you sent me a dvd, I will nebver buy something from you again","I wanted buy the book but you sent me a dvd, I will never buy something from you again heinrich geisser. Thde book would interest me very much"
4,As Promised,"Stretch & Seperate delivers everything as promised and more. It's clump free and doesn't disintegrate into undereye concealer causing ""raccoon eyes."" When preparing for a really long day, I use one thin coat of Stretch & Seperate followed by one coat of clear masacara. It magnifies a natural looking effect. I am using Cover Girl Professional Natural Lash No Color mascara for the top coat.Max Factor Stretch & Separate Waterproof Mascara, Rich Black 305 1 ea"
4,Same Opinion,Shocks fit. And fit as advertised in wording. But agree with (and thankful for) the previous reviewer who said the picture does not match the product. Glad a user picture was posted or I might have shy'ed away from buying.
1,Worst Customer Service for high price,"I purchased 5 ceivas for our family, and I am completely unsatisfied. Ceiva frames are a nice idea, but for the hundreds of dollars you will spend for pure frustration with the web site and customer service it is not worth it. I have tried countless times to correct Ceiva's mistake with my gift subscription for my mother and they will not correct it. When you call, you have to wait 10-15 minutes on the phone with no correction to your problem. When you email, they tell you to call. When they make promises they never follow through. This is the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED FOR AN OUTRAGIOUS PRICE! I will never recommend this product to anyone. There are better and cheaper alternatives to digital frames out there. Don't Buy Ceiva!"
2,Misleading information,"The information about this product stated that it could use the XD memory card. THIS IS INCORRECT! An adapter is needed, which adds to the price of the product. Also the picture does not seem as clear as some other picture frames I have seen."
1,THE WORST!,"I know she made this early on in her career, but given this woman's power today I am surprised she allows it to still circulate. This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Get the Jeanne Moreau edition, that one will satisfy you more than this piece of turd!"
