3,It's alright...,"This little handvac has a lot of suction power and is great for cleaning up dirt and debris in the car. However, the carpet attachment fell apart three days after I had the product. It was pretty easy to put back together since there were no broken pieces but I worry that it will be worse down the line. Emptying it out proved to be a challenge since I had to use a plastic knife to fish out some debris stuck between the opening and where it empties into the reservoir. I think it was worth the price I paid for though..."
3,"great power,poor design.","Great power,poor design. needs accessories like the HV9010 brush.There's a little area above the inlet that collects debris that is difficult to remove. Great suction though. Accessories from the HV9010 should be included."
4,Good one,Most important feature - Vacuum and Blower in one device. It is important to have both the function in one device. I would strongly recommend to buy.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this to clean up dog hair on furniture. (My dog is an Aussie/Golden mix with lots of long hair.) I used it on my couch, but I had to go back over it with the hand tools on my bulky upright to get rid of all the dog hair. Maybe it works better for short-haired pets. As for general use (other than dog hair), my cordless dustbuster works just as well as this one, without the hassle of a cord."
2,Not as good as........,"Try this : Bissell Pet Hair Eraser Handheld Vacuum, Corded, 33A1It is smaller with great power,no roller brush to clog and fail and it is frustration free.I know,I have 3 cats!"
3,"Doesn't help with speed, but kinda fun","I originally purchased this to help my 6 year old to drill her addition facts but liked the fact that she could do multiplication and division later with the same toy. I ended up returning it and getting the Math Mat because this toy while fun doesn't really help with speed. The way it works is an equation comes on the screen and then the number buttons start lighting up, you have to WAIT till the correct number lights up, hit it, and then hit enter (you could hit clear if you accidentally hit the wrong button). It seems there is alot of waiting involved for the correct number to light up. It seems well made and should last a while but we wanted speed drills."
2,a disappointment,"After trying other math toys where you had a twist knobs to enter an answer, this toy seemed superior in that you could quickly hit the correct answer with the mallet. Because they've tried to make this more ""fun"" by only accepting the correct answer when the numbers light up, there is a lot of time sitting there waiting for the numbers, and NOT much time actually drilling math facts. Additionally, I was disappointed because some of the questions are formatted in a more complicated way giving you 7 x ? = 35. This could have been a really terrific speed drill game, but wound up being complicated and frustrating for my kids who are still learning the answers. They can't deal with not only having the correct answer but getting it when it lights up, before the time is out, AND having to hit ""enter"" after they put their numbers in. ALSO, this game is very big, measuring 8.5"" x 15"". I will say that it seems to be well made. Don't expect it to replace good old fashioned flashcards."
5,Sewer's creative friend--must for sewers and weavers,"Like to sew? Like to make a signature work? This book has how to make buttons, ties, closures, cords and all in a very exciting way. Though some of the pictures seem dated (80's over-the-top ornamentation) and though this book is in black and white except for some opening large photographs, this will stimulate your creativity.People who should read this: those doing polymer clay ornamentation and jewelry, people interested in creative bookbinding and scrapbooking (why? Ideas for novel closures apply to books as well as jackets.) Also handweavers, who are looking for unique ways to make their craft stand out at craft fairs. Also of course anyone who sews their own clothes or designs clothes for sale. Highly Recommended."
3,Winning at New Products,"This book turned out to be not unlike most other books out there on the subject of New Product Development. I guess I was looking for something different, something more Power Point in Style, even if it were in black and white. I took it with me to the mountains to read on a three day vacation, but it was a struggle to get through it. My background is Industrial Design and I am always interested in books like this. It just was not my cup of tea."
1,DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a very poorly made costume and you get WAY too overly overheated.Also that this is only in adult sizes and my son bought this product and this made him miss a very nice halloween party because this was in such bad condition and WAY too big. Think twice before you click that buy button and really think that is this worthless piece of junk really worth your time and 40 dollars?!?Be wise, and don't buy this product."
5,Gift for my mother-in-law,The bingo cards were part of a gift for my mother in law and her bingo group at the local senior citizens center. They were absolutiely thrilled with the size of the numbers and the ease in using the cards.
4,"Simple, easy to read guide for basics","This book helped me go through the basics of starting up a company, it helped me clear up simple ideas with a few basics questions.It's diversity of topics and the arrangement of them, make it very simple to follow.Great book, very happy with it, i'll certainly go back to it as my company goes.R"
4,very useful resource,A good resource - makes you consider different things and you can easily apply them to your chosen industry
3,Not what I expected.,"Patty and Tommy are expecting their first child when Tommy is arrested for robbery and murder in the second degree. The Good Wife was not what I expected it be. In my opinion, it's not a page turner; yet, I was compelled to finish it, to find out what happens to Patty. This is the first novel I've read by Stewart O'Nan and his writing is pleasant. His introspective is accurate. The Good Wife provides more insight into how families are treated within the penal system than courtroom drama, but mostly it's a story about Patty, Tommy, their son and how they cope with life while Tommy is in jail."
2,Not a cliffhanger,"This book was so disappointing. It has an intriguing premise but the lack of tension and plot twist left me cold. The characters and story became so predictable and the ending is sappy sweet, it was very unsatisfying."
3,one hot alien,"if you like campy b-movies then you must see dr.alien, it,s funny, it has judy landers, tons of hot sexy women, what more could you ask for."
2,"Some good recipes, but terminal case of ""the cutes""","I would recommend borrowing this book from your library before buying, as this is not your typical cookbook.The layout is very busy with graphics and informational tidbits, giving the book a very cluttered appearance. All of the recipes have silly names, most of which give you no clue as to what's being made. You either like the style or you don't. I found it annoying to wade through for the most part. On the other hand, your children might like the style.You are probably best off copying the recipes you like onto plain paper/recipe cards so you don't get distracted when making them up, and just keep the book for reading like you would any other."
4,Low-fat cooking shouldn't be this much fun!,I LOVE this cookbook. Not only are the recipes delicious and easy to fix - the illustrations and comments are so funny you forget to feel depressed about having to eat low-fat food! My teenage son even likes it - how's that for a recommendation??
5,Fabulous,"One of my favourite albums -- gorgeous, fun, propulsive music. Koehne admires 50s pop, and composers like Mancini, and this music deliberately shows that influence. As far away from 12 tone as you can get."
2,amazon.com,"This book is great for anyone who doesn't agree on relying on the use of computers to improve a classroom. I don't fully agree with Stoll's ideas and opinions given in this book. He leans more toward the issue that computers are more of a problem than a tutor in the classroom.Stoll identified some good ideas, but it seemed that he only over-analyzed these and carried them too far. I do agree that there are some distractions and negativities about applying computer use in the classroom, but I more strongly think that they tend to help students more than hurt them.Although Stoll makes some very good points in his book, he shows very little information to back up his opinions."
2,no scholarship,Sounds more like billowy hot air from a Rush Limbaugh type. And I am one who agrees with Stoll's general comments. He could have said it all in a book half the length.A lot of catchy slogans to banter about at a cocktail party. But no real scholarship.How do we learn? Stoll offers scant scientific evidence for his strong opinions. His book sounds like it was put together by surfing the web for a bunch of ideas. A lot of cut & pasting with little support. Not even a list of references or bibliography. All of what Stoll condemns!
3,the new computer world,"I agree with most of what the author said. I feel computers have come a long way in our time. They however will never be able to completely replace teachers. Computers are helpful in many ways, but can not interact with a student.. You need a teacher there to really make a child feel needed. I don't really agree with all of this book, but it would be helpful for a class assignment."
3,Hightech Heretic,"Hightech Heretic was a very interesting book. I am so used to hearing how wonderful computers are so great for the school systems. But when I started reading this book I heard a different side. The book brought informative points out about how computers might not be so great for all school systems. I enjoy hearing all sides of every story and I found this book very informative. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a quick read, but something that keeps your attention. Also i recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good debate."
3,The Opinion's of a man on computers in the Classroom.,"High-Tech Heretic was an interesting novel that was contradictory and controversial. The never ending argument on whether computers are a good idea to have in ever classroom where chrildren can be distracted or use them for useful endeavors. Clifford Stoll did not want computers in the classroom for many reasons, one being that it would harm the development of certain social skills of children in their younger years. It is very addicting to play games and surf the web. Could it really be that dangerous though to allow a child some recreational time on a computer, especially if it is for a school project, it would definatly help out the librarian, that is for sure. So I thought the book was good, it is a much talked about subject and I would recommend it to teachers going into the field."
3,High Tech,"High Tech Heretic was a book that I thought I would never see written. Stoll talks about how computers are so over used, and depended upon in todays. Computers make things much more complicated than they need to be. Computers can teach us many things but it is my opinion that one on one or the class room setting will never be replaced. However I don't totally agree with everything in the book. I do think computers have a place in the class room but only at a limited use for the students."
1,Do NOT buy this laptop,"I bought this laptop from Best Buy and within 3 weeks it started failing. It would power down spontaneously. I called the Compaq tech support hotline. They told me that they have not heard of any problems with this model of laptop.I took it in to Best Buy and they exchanged it with a Sony Vaio of the same performance. They didn't even test it to see if there was a problem. But the guys behind the counter did say that they had seen some come back.I checked Compaq's Website and the 715 is not even offered anymore! They are coming out with the 717 which has the exact same specs as the 715... Needless to say, this laptop is a lemon and Compaq is trying to cover it up."
5,makes a fun desktop decor to show others how you're feeling!,"i would highly recommend this product....it can work well at home or work to show others how you feel without verbalizing aloud....fun way to express your emotions....great for both the young and old! very colorful and lots of feeling choices! as a therapist, one could leave it out on the table for clients to express their feelings as well!"
1,Didn't like,I was looking forward to this as the review said it was the best of the History of Texas books. It is very boring and dry for such an exciting state. The print was tiny and I couldn't read it. I got thru about 2 chapters before I gave up. I ordered two other books instead.
4,good book,Good service. got here quickly. great book. It was interesting and I loved reading it. I had to read it for my Texas history class and really enjoyed it. I learned a lot.
5,Not much more a book can do...,This book comes close to giving an overview of what it might be like to have a relationship with a real teacher but don't mistake the book for the teacher. Don't expect to get from a book what is needed and only available from a living teacher. Find a teacher if you want to achieve anything.
3,"interesting study, but not terribly well explained","This book is useful, especially for its case studies of the conflicts in Abkazia and Ajaria (separatist regions in Georgia). The thesis, that geography--land itself--is central to ethnic conflict, seems fairly obvious when one is discussing state and national borders, but Toft strangely asserts that it is her original idea!Overall, the book is useful to those interested in the particular case studies. Too jargony at times, the writing is occassionally repetitive. It is a thin book, and some additional case studies would have been welcome.Overall, a flawed but still appreciable contribution to the literature on ethnic conflict and separatism."
4,Wheels on Meals,"This movie takes a little getting into, but it truly delivers some great actions fight sceens with Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao (his boyhood friend from Chinese Opera School)against some high kicking US champions kick boxing. Sammy Hung also has a part in this movie so the three brothers are together and they all make this movie one to have if you are a Jackie Chan fan."
5,Yes!..The best fight scene,"I totally love this movie.I recommend you buying this movie soon as possible, especially the greatest fighting scene with Jackie Chan against Benny""The Jet""Urquidez.I think this battle is the greatest because it is just a one on one fight and IT JUST ROCKSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,A typical chan movie,"wheels on meals is a prety typical film, its funny, there is kung-fu and the story is ok. But there are better Chan movies like drunken master or youn master."
1,Outdated and disappointing,"This book appears to be a copy of numerous different CIS tests, which included outdated technology information and wrong answers. Little if any value for the CLEP."
1,NOT a review for the AP test!,"A review manual for the AP test could reasonably be expected to at least mention the *existence* of the five C++ AP classes. This book does not.It could also be expected to do more than mention that there is a College Board case study and then phrase its study as something *optional*. (The case study is the subject of at least one of the four extended response questions, and a good handful of the multiple choice.)In glancing at the book, I was shocked to find that, although it gives a thorough-but-terse overview of theory, it seems to have little actual relation to the exam itself."
4,Computer Science A & AB,"This book is considered as a pretty good review book forstudents who are taking the AP computer science test 'A'. It coversmost of the stuffs throughout the one semester class. However, it doesn't cover all the materials for students who are taking AP computer science test 'B'. Therefore, I would only recommand to people who are planning to take the form 'A' test. Try ""Be Prepared for the AP Computer Science Exam by Maria Litvin"" (which is also avalible on Amazon.com) to get a better prepare! But afterall, it consist clear and easy understanding words and concise programing codes plus four pre-Exam which will help to boost up your score to a 4 or even a 5!"
1,Poor on many levels,I find the characters in this book unsympathetic and the plot entirely unrealistic. To believe that the serial killer could be so close so often and not be spotted is beyond belief. I am sick of Eve's whining.
1,Creepy Men and Annoying Women,I am getting ready to move to our new house and needed a new book to read. Well for some reason this one did not get packed so I grabbed it. What a waste of time. First of all Jane has to be one of the most annoying characters I have come across in a long time. I was actually cheering for Aldo to kill her just so she would shut up. Then Trevor (an adult male) having a crush on Jane (a 17 year old girl) was just creepy. I do not care if he was there to try and help no preverted man who is lusting after my high school daughter is coming into our lives.The plot was pathetic and after all the building up to catch Aldo the writer ends the climax in like two paragraphs.DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME !!!
1,"Not the worst book I've ever read, but close","I just finished this book today, and I wish I had read some of the reviews before I ever picked it up. The characters are boring, shallow, and non-descript, and the plot is perfectly linear and predictable. I finished it, which is more than I can say for a few books, but I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Not As Good As I Thought.,I am a big fan of Iris Johannsen's books. I am normally glued to them until I finish. I read Fatal Tide in 1 1/2 days. I normally enjoy the Eve Duncan series. I just couldn't seem to get into this book. I didn't enjoy it as much. I almost felt it was too far fetched.I look forward to anything else that the author will be putting out. I was just disappointed in this book.
1,I give this a MINUS 5 star rating. Save your money!,"Three times I picked up this book and started it. Three times I put it down and read something else instead. Since I let myself run out of reading material I picked this up again. It is truly one of the worst Iris Johansen books ever written. As the previous reviewer said ""It's far fetched and a lot of drivel."" After reading the first hundred pages or so I finally flipped to the last chapter and read through that, skipping entire paragraphs. This is really a no brainer, no suspense, most repetitive book I have ever tried to read. I give it a MINUS 5 star rating. I have purchased my last Iris Johansen novel. Save your money. Buy Stuart Woods, James Patterson or Lisa Gardener."
3,Good read,"I like the characters and the plot, even though it is far fetched. Readers of Eve Duncan series may be dissapointed as this book deals more with Jane (the daughter). I hope that Ms. Johansen ages Jane a little more in the next book. It is hard to imagine adults taking orders from a 17 yr.old no matter how rational they may be."
1,This book stinks,"I have read all of Iris Johansen's Eve Duncan series, and I'm sorry to say, this book was a real waste of paper and ink. It is poorly written with a completely stupid plot. A tremendous disappointment to all of us Eve Duncan fans."
5,The Bible of market microstructure theory,"This is the quintessential book on the theory of the microstructure of financial markets. Although it is not meant for people with just a casual interest in the area, it is nevertheless an indispensable book for academics and for people serious about the topic.It is also far more readable and understandable than Daniel Spurber's book which provides little of the working intuition of O'Hara. In fact Spurber is meant more for the theoretical economist with an interest in market microstructure, whereas O'Hara appeals to a broader audience in the field of finance."
5,"Dr.Azeem Alam Khan MBBS(QAU),M.Sc(UK),FACP(USA).","I bought this book today and read it.It is an excellent book,fungal diseases are discussed one by one with illustrations,pictures,slides and in some cases microbiology.One can review all the important fungal infections in short time.It is a modern book with WEB SITES at the back.Treatment are also discussed.It is a small 114 page book but covers a vast topic of cutaneous fungal infections.It is helpful for the undergraduate and postgraduate medical and dermatology students.I shall be very grateful if somebody can donate this book for our Hospital Library !Dr.Azeem Alam Khan,Al O'srah international hospital,PO Box 37509 Riyadh 11449Saudi Arabia."
4,New feel,Slightly thinner and paler than green soaps I have used before. And it sometimes gums up the applicator (Mine has a very fine opening). But its good soap and cleans well. Gets automotive grease off fast!!
5,One of the best albums ever,The best Mangione album... one of the best recordings of all time to my ear.
1,don't bother checking your answers,"I purchased this title along with two other Catholic high school test prep books. While randomly flipping through the pages, I stopped on one of the language arts practice tests. I checked my answers with the answer key provided in the back of the book, and found two errors in less than one minute.I returned the book to Amazon the next day. Not a good purchase."
4,TRACKLIST FOR 'GOODBYE BLUE SKY',"GODLEY & CREME - Goodbye Blue Sky(1988, Polydor, P32P 20151)Tracks:1. H.E.A.V.E.N2. A Little Piece of Heaven3. Don't Set Fire (To the One I Love)4. Golden Rings5.

5,Wow!,"Once I started reading this book by Yalom, I couldn't put it down. What a surprise, it was one of those required books for a class, and now its a proud part of my book collection. Great insight into what a master therapist is thinking about his clients and their treatment plans, as well as existential issues that arise. And oh yes, dream stuff too. Fun book to read. Must read."
5,"Like Father, Like Son","Outstanding material that clearly articulates issues fathers and sons face in their relationship, from the author and coauthor who each faced unique trauma as sons, and also had experience being fathers.The stories really brought the material home in a way that is easy to identify with, and great for discussion groups."
2,Uninspired and plodding.,"Stephen Ambrose writes mechanically at best and is in need of a good editor. Mr Ambrose has an unabashed ""crush"" on Meriwether Lewis, much to the detriment of Wm Clark and Sacagawea. After the captains-2 hit the trail, I had a hard time forcing myself to plod along with their not-so-merry band. Paddled a boat, ate some meat, traded with Indians, ad nauseam for 1800 miles. And then we retraced our steps! It took me six months for read this leaden tome."
4,Ambrose REALLY likes Lewis and Jefferson!!,"Stephen Ambrose REALLY likes Meriwether Lewis and Thomas Jefferson. He positively gushes adoration when speaking of these two figures of American expansionism. Roughly, UNDAUNTED COURAGE is the story of how Jefferson and Lewis put their heads together to form an expedition of men to forge through the wilderness of what is now the northwestern United States in order to try to find an all-water passage to the Pacific ocean, and how the resulting exploration succeeded in some ways, but failed in others. At 480+ pages, the book is just long enough to give you the feel of the whole account, with plenty of excerpts from Lewis' and Jefferson's writings, but left me wanting to read more of the details. Where can I get a copy of Thwaite's edition of the Lewis & Clark journals? :o) I recommend this book for anyone interested in the history of the United States in the early 1800's. It is easily readable for high school level and up."
5,great book,"Very enjoyable book. While I was familiar with the generalities of the Lewis & Clark expedition, I was not even close to having an understanding of the detail on any level. Ambrose provides that detail (the difficult traveling, Jefferson's political manuverings, background of Lewis & Clark etc) in a very readable manner that had me unwilling to put the book down. If anyone has interest in this period of American History, this is a must read."
1,Well written--but by whom?!?,This work is said to be plagarism--see Scandals and Scoundrels: Seven Cases That Shook the Academyby Ron Robin
1,undaunted courage,"Most unpleasant book. The auther's critique of Lewis was disapointing. Constantly anilyzing his thoughtrs and deeds. How bad he treated the Indians, how he was a mail chovenous. Reading this book was very depressing."
4,An incredible adventure,"For the first hundred or so pages, I grew a bit impatient, getting more minutia about Lewis' early life than I wanted. But it was a small price to pay. The journey up the Missouri, over the mountains to the Pacific, and then back, is an incredible adventure, vividly told. The writing is crisp and descriptive -- You can feel Lewis' awe as he stands at the continental divide, his depression during the dreary Oregon winter, and the excitement and fear of each new encounter with Indian communities. A most memorable read."
2,Over-rated,"I feel like maybe I missed something, given all the hype that surrounded this book. But I found that it didn't seem to add much to the subject matter: it seemed like a rather weak summary of the explorers journals. I keep feeling like I would have been better reading the primary source material or a different survey of that material. I like Ambrose's other works and am a avid history reader, but this one really feel short. The subject matter may simply not as suited to Ambrose's style. Someone like Robert Kaplan (Balkan Ghosts), Rebecca West (Black Lamb and Grey Falcon) or William Dalrymple (From the Holy Mountain) would have done a much better job of weaving in what Lewis and Clark were seeing and experiencing within the context of their times and pulled in additional material to illuminate the subject matter."
4,Mostly about Meriwether Lewis.,"I hardly knew anything about the expedition before this book which provides a lot of incredible information from Meriwether Lewis. But as the book describes, it's all from Lewis. We don't know anything about Clark's version or any of the other men who kept journals. The expedition split up several times and we never know what happened to any of the other groups, we only know of Lewis' groups.Considering all the interesting things that happened to him I'm sure those other men had just as interesting stories of their own.If you're into knowing everything about the trip, this should be ONE of the books you read."
3,This book brought out the courage in men,I thought the direct approach to the Pacific Ocean was not possible. Otherwise the book brought the characters to life and exposed their vulnerabilities as well as their bravery.
3,Courage,"It gave all the facts, and it told the story. Kids don't love the subject. It only told about Lewis and Clark."
2,"Too much detail, dryly written","This book was very dissapointing. I started it thinking I was going to learn some history and get a good adventure story at the same time. Instead, I got really bogged down about half way through the book in all the minute details of Lewis and Clark's trip-- first they walked here, then they walked there, then one tripped, then the other yawned, etc. After a while it was all the same, and I didn't much care what happened to them. It was all I could do to finish this book. The most interesting parts were the first few chapters, where the reasons for the journey and the climate of the times were discussed. I don't understand how so many readers can rave about this book."
3,Good book but not good for Kindle,"This is an interesting, well written book. However, books like these are problematic for the Kindle because of the difficulty in flipping back and forth between the references, maps, and text. When you look up something in the reference section (which is at the end of the book), Kindle marks this spot as the furthest point read. So when you open the book again or start reading the book on another synced device (e.g., phone, laptop), it goes to the reference section not to the page you last read (this makes it difficult to find the page you last read unless you memorized the page number before closing the book). Similarly, it is not user friendly when going to a map (front of the book) and back to the page that was being read. I suggest a hard copy of the book for the best experience."
4,Undaunted Courage,"The book makes you feel as though you are with the Corps of Discovery, every step of the way. You can easily imagine endless herds of Buffalo and the physical strain of the men with each step of their journey. To alter an old saying, Truth is more exciting than fiction. This book will give you an appreciation of the strength, determination, and the courage of our forefathers."
5,Takes the stress out of the GRE process,I have gone crazy the last few weeks looking for a good GRE guide. I think I've found it at last. This book is concise and told me exactly what I needed to know to prepare for the test. The book's test-taking strategies have really helped me. Why wasn't I taught these things in high school?
2,This book is intended for advanced wood workers only !,"I received this book and returned it the same day! Five workbenches were reviewed and none gave, what I would call, detailed information on how to build a workbench. Besides, this book is solely written for the ""very serious to professional"" woodworker. I feel that this book is not intended for 85% of those wanting information on building a workbench."
4,A nice history of the workbench,"I like this book, I'm glad I have it... but it is based largely on the history of the workbench and it's evolution. There are certainly things to learn from this and I have refined my own bench design because of it. However, for those looking for a series of detailed plans for various benches this is may be not the book for you. Perhaps look at this book as extended research as opposed to the finished project manual."
3,Not Everyone's Cup of Tea,"Interesting book, but knowing everything there is to know about workbenches from their first uses in history, to the way workbenches are used throughout the world is not my cup of tea. While I appreciate the knowledge and scholarship that went into this book, I was more interested in building a workbench for myself and not the minute details of a thoroughly researched book. While this book can provide some inspiration, it is way too technical for an average woodworker who just wants a serviceable bench for his or her shop."
2,Not As Good As the Others,"Edgar Rice started a brilliant series with energy, but in this fourth installment, he fails to capture the full mystery and awe presented in his first three installments of the Pellucidar Series. By ""Tarzan at the Earth's Core"", you can tell the Pellucidar Series is starting to lose steam."
4,Nice Selection,"This is a nice little selection if you are trying to find a condom that is both comfortable and your wife/girlfriend/lover likes. They all pretty close to the same size, but the different shapes, lubes, and material thicknesses make for a fun experiment to find what's best for you."
4,Falconer - The Sceptre of Deception,"""The Sceptre of Deception"" (2003) is the third release from Swedish folk/power metal band Falconer. This is a concept album; all the songs have to do with a story of Falconer's own devising, and which is further explained in the liner notes.Broadway-style singer Matthias Blad has been replaced by Kristoffer Göbel (although Blad does appear on this album). Göbel's voice is vaguely similar, although he sings much more in the metal tradition.Musically, Falconer continues to write interesting (if not amazing) power metal songs with catchy choruses. There's not a bad song on this album, but there's nothing destined for the metal hall of fame, either.On the whole, this is quite a decent power metal album, although with Göbel replacing Blad, Falconer takes a step back toward the rest of the power metal pack."
1,Awful indeed!,"The previous review by Mr Hayes, is on the mark. The film quality is worse than awful; I strongly suspect that an ancient black-and-white film has been colorized. Whether that's the case or not, the current color is garish and grainy. Even my love of Prokofiev's music will not prevent me from discarding this DVD, since offering it for resale would violate my principles."
3,Is it live or is it Memorex?,I've read the other reviews and it seems to me that it's worth seeing for some of the footage but the editing is in the crapper at points. It was filmed but it wasn't a complate concert from beginning to end and the editing is too fast between cameras at the time if was filmed from what I gather. The CD is better sounding and there's not any overplay/underpaly of the video and song structure.
1,Ozzy Osbourne a real psycho,"In this video Ozzy portrays a real madman, cussing and ranting and raving are common on this ridiculous flop! Probaly because Ozzy never learned how to sing. If you want a video where an old man runs around yelling the f word and flicking the camera off this is for you, otherwise watch out! Some of the songs are performed o.k. but the thing about the muffins is absolutly stupid! Lots of perverted situations in this video too, I wouldn't pay a dollar for it and no one under the age of 18 should view it!"
2,Not a good DVD Music title,"The sound quality of this DVD is not good, and the video quality is not clear, either. Apparently it was transfer from analog system and the engineer who did the job didn't do anything to improve the quality of this DVD."
5,Great fun,"This is a great watch. Nothing other than a good peak at Ozzy.Thoroughly enjoyable, and very watchable.If you are a fan, it's probably the best single item outside of ""Don't Blame Me"".... worth every penny !!!"
2,BARGAIN RACK,"Who am I to say this collage of seemingly unrelated music/talk bits is pondering and insignificant? No kidding, song 2 IS ""The Theme From Dragnet"". ""In no sense? Nonsense!""? No, no sense."
4,Japanese Tabi Socks,"Cons: White band on the top disrupts the color of the sock, the garter should have been black alsoTop band was also a little snug to the calfPros: Arrived in a timely mannerSocks were individually wrapped and secured with metallic clasps, very secure, therefore, arrived undamaged.Nice lookFeels cool on feet"
3,Sold illegally?,"Product was as described. However, the box is marked all over ""Not for retail sale"" and it makes me wonder why. When I initially got my glucose monitor, it came with a box of test strips marked the same way. Is someone selling the meters and the test strips that are supposed to come with them seperately to gain a profit? Highly unethical if that's the case."
5,For getting those nice shreds,"The extra coarse grater is the one you want for nice long shreds of ginger, chocolate, vegies & hard cheese. It does not make shavings nor does it make a fine zest (I use my coarse grater for that). The frame is sturdy metal with a rubber wrap on the far end so it will not slip as you grate at a 45 degree angle. I have broken the plastic edged grates by Microplane (admittedly it took years) but this Professional series frame will last as long as the the grater. Workhorse kitchen utensil in our kitchen. Great product."
5,Top of the Line,Incredibly sharp. The rubber base secures well and feels very natural while grating. Clean-up is a snap with very few places for debris to accumulate. The cover is a great feature for easy storage in a drawer. I am so glad I chose to give this grater a try.I've used standard off the shelf box graters before and I finally got sick of them always losing their rubber bases or breaking where they were sealed together. Not to mention the clean-up on a box grater is always a bit of a chore. Storage on box graters also suck as they just take up too much room.Microplane is a quality product and their Professional line has everything you want in a grater. What more could you ask for?
3,Micro Size Stocking Stuffer! Not For Serious Dino Play!,"If you're hoping for some great jurassic battle play then I suggest you move up to the larger models. These are very small and did not hold my dino lover's interest for long. Also, they are too easy to get lost with their micro size. Buy larger ones, and then when your child gets ready to play dino valley at least he'll be able to easily locate his dinoaurs."
1,Zero Stars - Stay well away from this disc!,"Hard core Yes and Chris Squire fans will wax apologetically about the redeeming features of the Squire/Sherwood collaboration. Sorry, there are none! Any honest musical appraisal reveals this is an uninspired, pedestrian and very dated effort. I cannot believe anyone could massage songs for 10 years and arrive at this!Chris Squire is a fine bass player and a much under-rated and under-recorded vocalist, it is such a pity that this `drink coaster' so much devalues his small recording output.`A Fish Out of Water' shines like a beacon!"
3,It was okay,I was expecting to hear clearer bird songs. When they did sing it was overpowering the other sounds of the forest
1,Terrible. Do Not Buy!,"Loud, sharp (too frequent to be relaxing) bird calls for first 30 mins then sounds more like static for remainder of CD with barely audible, infrequent bird calls in background."
4,"Good information, but not as in depth as it could be","This was purchased as a gift for my son. He has really enjoyed reading through it, and we plan to try out some of his newly learned skills on a ""roughing it"" camping trip."
4,pure fun(k),"i didn't expect much of this album since i knew almost nothing about it before buying, but it turned out to be a great mixture of funky house (or housy funk ...) with a little touch of disco (just in the amount that won't make it a stupid retro album). very recommended if you'r looking for a house album that is neither too superficial nor too ""hardcore""."
1,Mine must be defective,"In the box this loader looks awesome. However the locking mechanism that holds the bucket from tipping down is made of plastic, and just doesn't work. If you load the bucket anymore than a quarter to a half full of sand, it is too heavy and the bucket just tips forward. If the sand is at all wet ... forget about it. However reading all these other rave reviews, I wonder if mine is just defective. I have great memories of Tonka trucks as a kid, but I am having a rough run with the new Tonka generation."
3,"A Talent, but Second Tier","Fans of North African music and movies conjure up 'Rick's Place' in 'Casablanca' and hope for North African-International music that might fit that era. Maurice El Medioni may have come from there but he does not deliver what contemporary North African music lovers might hope for or what 'Colonialists' might wish to remember. This CD also features 'The Klezmatics'--a modernized reference to klezmer music traditions typified, for me, by Giora Fiedman. They and their tradition don't get much of an outing here. I wanted to see these two 'grooves' come together! For my taste, Maurice El Medioni delivers piano music that features changes in rhythms, percussive effects and wonderful tonalities but he does not captivate. Many of his compositions draw too much from the same well and feature the same sonic effects. For me, this outing of his is a bit like a third-world lounge act."
3,It's okay...,"...but only because it's Jurassic 5. As others have mentioned, Cut Chemist's presence is sorely missed. It's an okay album, but J5's worst by far. If you're new to J5 pick up the EP, Quality Control, and Power in Numbers before you even think about getting this album."
3,soso,i like the earlier albums better.they seem to reference being cool & powerful too much for my taste.perhaps this is the direction the manager pushed them:(
1,Horrible!,"As a (once) big Jurassic 5 fan, I couldn't believe how terrible this album was. The lyircs got old fast, the beats were boring and like another reviewer mentioned, I got sick of the whole ""girl/getting over shyness"" type of songs. This album reminded me of a no-name group that wants to get big fast so their label puts a whole bunch of big name stars on the album to gain more fans and radio play...NOT what I would expect from a solid group like J5 at all!Power in Numbers was just okay to me, and they totally lost me with this latest release; I will not be buying another J5 album from here on out. It's no wonder Cut Chemist left the group..."
5,Terrific service and prices,Very competive prices and quick service equals a firm I will continue to do business with
2,Poor quality,"I don't think these Skechers are made out of leather, so I'm very disappointed. I thought I was purchasing a quality shoe from a reputable manufacturer, but with such a low price it was ""too good to be true""."
5,Great book!!!!!,I read this book as a child and remember not being able to put it down. I now have a 9 year old daughter that loves to read and I know she will love this book too.
3,It`s All Go,"Based on Arthur Hailey`s book of the same name, it is a pleasant enough film. We follow the lives of the staff and a number of the guests. Rod Taylor is the very efficient Hotel Manager, Merle Oberon the Duchess and Michael Rennie her husband, the Duke. My favourite was Karl Malden as the thief who showed us a number of ways in which he got keys to rooms other than his own!Set in New Orleans we see some lovely parts of the old city. The leading lady was European actrss Catherine Spaak. Very attractive but I don`t think she made a lot of American films.A nice film but not a world beater."
4,"""Some good songs for a great price!""","It almost is like this is a little soundtrack with a few songs from a few films. It contains two songs from Flashdance, ""Maniac"" from Michael Sembello and surprisingly, ""What A Feeling"" from Irene Cara. This is a surprise since this song is rare on 1980's hits collections. Another surprise was Bananarama's ""Cruel Summer"". This song was missing from ""The Karate Kid"" soundtrack, the scene where this song was most popular, while the original album it came from is out of print in the U.S., the self- tilted Bananarama. This is a fun song. Also included is ""Up Where We Belong"" from Joe Cocker and Jennifer Warnes, the hit from ""An Officer and a Gentleman."" Also on the album are two other great songs, ""Lady In Red"" from Chris DeBurgh and ""Into the Night"" from Benny Mardones. Great songs for a cheap price. Buy it! It's worth it."
2,Disappointed after all the hype,"My subject line says it all. If this album had been all instrumental, it would have garnered a 10. Did not care for the singer's voice."
3,fair toy,"Over the Christmas season I purchased this toy for one of my kids, one for a niece and one for a nephew. I was so excited because I remember having this toy when I was a child. Well, I guess they didn't bother to make the toy a better product then it was 25 years or so ago. It's still fun to play but is not a very durable toy. The legs constantly pop off and when the mouth gets a certain amount of bugs in it the head starts to make a grinding sound and doesn't work properply. Just wish I remembered that before I bought three of them."
5,You Can If You Think You Can,"I love Dr. Peale, I was able to see him in person before his dead. I read many of his books. I read this book many years ago, it chanced my life, because it gave me a new direction that I could follow . I still have the old book, but I now have big print. The words in print might be old stuff, but it moves me each time that I read his words. Maybe his words will also move you in a new direction. "" I believe, that You can do anything in life, If You only believe that you can."""
2,poorly made... you get what you pay for,"I really wanted to love these, but after two sets of sloppily ground blades I gave up, returned them and went for Wusthof. I am surprised by all the high reviews I see."
4,Great Get-Together Game,"I first played this version of the game on a ski trip with a group of friends. We had a blast, and some of us continue to play whenever we get together. My husband and I will often play at home as well. The categories are fun, and the questions span a good range of difficulty. As stated on the box, the content covers ""General Knowledge Questions"", so there are a wide variety of topics for everyone. No matter what you specialize in, you're sure to find something that stumps you, as well as some easy ones to boost your ego, and your score!"
4,"The acting is the key here, not the plot.","Lee Marvin is at his minimalist best in this film. Boorman obviously had a great deal of respect for Lee Marvin's inate talent. This is one of the few films that seems to be a real collaboration between director and actor.In some of the scenes such as when Walker (character name) confronts his wife after she betrays him, Marvin never speaks. He doesn't need dialog to portray his emotional state. The violence is realistic. When Walker fires his .357 magnum, the recoil from this powerful weapon looks authentic. The fight scenes aren't clean and crisp. They are brief, messy and basic.The pitch here is subtle and played under the top instead of over. Mel Gibson has done a remake of this movie called ""Payback."" The story line is easier to follow than ""Pointblank"" but you will see a huge contrast in acting styles. I like the original."
3,companion pieces,"This character (whose original name is Parker) also appears in THE SPLIT, THE OUTFIT, SLAYGROUND, and PAYBACK.The OutfitSlayground (Ws)"
2,Hasn't aged well,"Unless you are a real fan of New Age and 1970s-era lonely films with jazz in the background, skip this. The scenery, clothing and cast are so firmly of the age that it feels at times like parody of this type of film. Every other shot is of an empty bed, empty diner, empty building -- OK, we get it, we're all alone. It just dragged for me."
3,The Art of the Hook,"Who knows why things turn out the way they do? If the high-rated sitcom ""Jesse"" had stayed on the air, this band might have stayed together and become more successful. But it was mysteriously canceled and along with it the raging power pop theme song ""Time for You."" This is a worthy album although it has its share of weak tracks. The good ones: the title track, ""Come Unglued,"" ""Superconductor,"" and ""Time for You"" make up for a general sense of blandness. Many of the ""soaring"" choruses sound too similar and seem rote. The band should have varied their song structures more with some ballads, some non-anthemic songs... But sparkling Beatlesque moments like ""Come Unglued"" make this worth buying or downloading."
2,Great for the first year.,"This driveway alarm worked GREAT - for the first year. Thirteen months after purchase (1 month after the warranty expired) the alarm started to malfunction, going through a battery every week. Customer service was of no help. Its been turned off for the last year, but we miss having the alarm, so we are currently shopping for a replacement. For the price, for one year's service, it will NOT be this unit."
1,A oft used premise done with little thought.,"The stranger come to town to look up an old buddy and finds that his buddy has disappeared has been done before but never with such cheap dialogue and yoyoing of suspense. In the first half hour you can already figure out what happened to Spencers friend. The rest of the movie is an attempt to build to a climax that never comes. No soliloquies or such. Just Spencer lumbering around the town, speaking some lines hear some lines there, hinting at this or that but nothing that we couldnt guess or nothing that brings us to a suprise twist on what we thought we had figured out. The townspeople each have a few minutes to threaten him in their own way and not convincingly at that.I dont know what the director had in mind for this film but its obvious he didnt accomplish it.Only good for seeing a thinner Ernest Borgnine."
4,Nice,"Nice -- rythmic, pulsating, soothing and erotic. Although this is a very good CD, I liked Tantra Drums (also by Al Gromer Khan) much better. This is a good purchase -- after Tantra Drums."
3,Inconsistent but very good in parts...,"I've had the MP3 versions of every song on this album since the old Napster days. I recently decided to part with about a dozen dollars to get the CD (used). No, it's overall not as good as Further -- and aside from the vocals, it doesn't even sound like the same band, either. But several of the songs on this are so great I just had to have it in CD form. I'll make this short and sweet.Recommended if you like: Remy Zero, Turin Brakes, The AutumnsEMINENTLY worth buying for: Dollars in the Heavens, Killing Stars, Amnesia Valley, Guidance System, A Place in the Sun"
4,Excellent Book Very Helpful,"I bought this book when starting a new relationship that ended in a very happy marriage. I had been married prevously, and didn't want to make the same mistakes again. This book helped by enabling us both to ""head problems off at the pass"". Would be a great gift at a bridal shower. Well worth reading."
2,wanted to like the story but couldn't get past the writing,"The Pearl Diver is the story about a 19 year old pearl diver who is diagnosed with leprosy in the 1940s and sent away to a leprosarium where she must forget her old life and start over on the leper island; segregated from the rest of the country who fear contact with such a horrifying disease.This was a beautiful story. Or, at least it had the potential to be. I really wanted to like it. But I couldn't get into the way the story was told through the artifacts catalogued from the leprosarium. It gave the story a disjointed feel and left me feeling disconnected from the characters. As it's told, it's not a bad story, but it could have been so much more powerful had more time been spent on character development.This story was really interesting, but not moving. It was overall a blah read. Disappointing. I feel like Miss Fuji's story still wants to be told."
4,Well Worth the Read,"The Pearl Diver is a beautifully written novel. The story, about a young woman who goes from being more of a seafood diver than a pearl diver to a leper in a leper colony off the coast of Japan. The characters are very well drawn and the images the author uses transport the reader to the island with the young woman.It was a pleasure to read about such an usual topic -- told in descriptive, but not gory language. I felt a range of emotions while reading the novel -- from sadness to anger to disappointment -- not of my own, but that of the young woman's experiences.This is definitely a novel for people who enjoy historical fiction and want to read something that is a departure from the typical period pieces. The writing is fine -- shaped very well with color and depth.Well worth the read."
2,Not for small dogs as advertised.,"The cookies are huge, I have a Chihuahua and have to break them up! Although she does seem to love the flavor."
1,"CONTAINS TWO CHEMICAL PARABENS, Endocrine Disruptors","Avoid products containing Paraben (methy,ethyl...) if you are attempting to balance your hormones. This product has two of these known endocrine disrupting chemicals that mimic estrogen in the body. The is the exact opposite action you are seeking if you are attempting to balance your estrogen dominence."
3,Video is okay but not worth ....,"I bought this video along with a couple of books: Fodors, The Best of BVI (Acheson) and the crusing guide that came with my ""Moorings"" bareboat cruising package. The video gave me an idea of what things generally looked like but wasn't very comprehensive. Watching it was a lazy way to get a brief overview of the islands but this is not a stand-alone option if you are traveling to BVI. If I had to do it again, considering the prices of the more comprehensive books (about half), I'd skip the video. I'd have a better opinion of the video if it were priced at $12."
2,Too far away from facts + The acting and directing are not engaging as other movies of the same genre.,"There are two things I don't like about this movie.1. There are many major details that are not true to history. Fitstly, Zi Long or Zhao Yun did not die in the battle. He died of old age (1). Secondly, at the battle of Chanban, Liu Bei's wife, Lady Gan was not killed. She's rescued by Zhao Yun. Thirdly, Zhao Yun never fought with Cao Cao's niece according to history!You can verify all the details by visiting wikipedia dot org. Sorry, I can't embed the link here. It seems Amazon is blocking that feature. If you find any other reliable website talking about the 3 kingdoms period in China, please put that information here. I'd appreciate that.2. The acting and directing are not engaging as in other movies of the same genes such as the Warlords. The fighting scenes are so so but they're not good as the ones in the Warlords either."
1,Poorly designed product.,Battery never lasted very long. Even if I didn't use the GPS. The GPS rarely worked and lost its signal constantly. I sent it back to Suunto twice to try and fix it with no change in performance. It must have been designed to work poorly. I don't think I can buy a Suunto watch again. Waste of money.
4,tai chi,"the shipping was in a timely manner, new condition, this has help me cultivate my already extensive practice, has also given great deal of helpful tips while learning, and or achieving advanced tai chi skill"
5,"Great performances and if you don't see it, you missed out.",MAGNIFICENT!! Great Plot. Good Actors. Keeps you interested
5,"Film New & Still Sealed, as Promised","Excellent price - was a steal! Movie was in pristine condition, and arrived in appropriate time. No complaints. I'd recommend this seller to anyone, based on my purchase. (Offered best deal of anyone listing this product)."
4,Powerful,"There are some great courtroom scenes in this movie that are so powerful and the acting is fantastic. The story of honor and pride in one's country and way of life is an inspiration for anyone who is a believer in truth, justice and the American Way."
4,Great Movie with an Amazing Cast,The DVD is great. Lots of Subtitle options not to mention the fact that the Movie is just simply amazing with a great Cast.
5,Super Movie,This movie is a great movie. It also is such a good movie in the beginning of Tom Cruise and Demi Moore's careers. And of course Jack Nicholson ... he didn't have much of a part ... but what a part he played in this movie.
4,A Few Bad Things,"This is generally a significantly better transfer than both the disastrous Sony LD and a slight improvement over the earlier, soft-edged DVD edition. But I still feel that chroma is not consistent. There is that reddish hue on fleshtones in some shots. I have to turn the COLOR down on my Sony Wega (to 40). There is also that occasional softness, although it is not as predominant as the earlier edition. But listen to the soundtrack near the beginning. The marching band opener is really a fantastic Dolby Digital demonstration with detail, bass extension, separation. This is mostly a dialogue driven piece so the rest of the movie is not exactly a room shaker. Extra features are satisfying given the fact this is quite an old film. Rob Reiner is still mumbling through a film commentary, though we should all be happy enough that he actually sits for a recording."
2,high school play,"This was originally a play. It looks like it was written for a high school production. I mean, the final ""confession"" is based on such a flimsy strategy, it's RIDICULOUS! Tom Cruise sucks, as usual. I mean, acting 101 tells you that when you're trying to look strong and forceful in a scene: DON'T BLINK. And there Tom Cruise is, blinking like a stoplight in the final showdown courtroom scene, when he's supposed to appear forceful. (To anyone who doubts me, rent LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, and study Peter O'Toole's strong unblinking performance). The technicians on this film give the film a nice look, and it's they who are worth praising...and some of the actors. I can handle that truth. Can you?"
2,A Few Good Men VHS.,"Misguided effort to portray to U.S. Military, I am sure it was an attempt by Meathead Rob Reiner to smear Our men in Uniform, that the movie has good acting and actors is not in question. The plot of the movie is,as well as the play it's based on. Demi Moore,Tom Cruise and even CastroLover commie Jack Nicholson does a Good job. Keifer does too.Kevin Pollack. But as far as being accurate in regards to how many our brave Men and Women are portrayed. it does a Disservice, there are many bad apples everywhere starting with hollywood. It appears liberals can't ""Stand"" the Truth. 2 Stars for this misguided effort."
2,Scenery-chewing 101,"The more I see of Tom Cruise, the more I realize he's one of the weakest actors getting top-quality roles these days, and every movie he's been in since The Firm (and most all of them before that-- there can never be an excuse for Top Gun, unless it's Hot Shots) would have been inestimably better with anyone but Tom Cruise in the starring role. Case in point: A Few Good Men, with a bunch of excellent performances counterpointed with Cruise and Jack Nicholson engaged in scenery-chewing contests throughout the movie. That aside, everyone else in this film from Cuba Gooding Jr. and Demi Moore to the woefully-underrated James Marshall worked miracles with a kludgy script and uninteresting direction work from Rob Reiner, who should stick to the mindless comedies we expect from him."
1,campy portrayal of the men in uniform,"I loved this movie when it came out. I recently saw the stage play. So I wanted to re-watch.First the soundtrack has to be the WORST soundtrack of all time. This was a stupid soundtrack that provided breaks for commercials.Second, the actors clearly know nothing of the military. But the fault does not end with them. I think the screenplay sucked in its very nature. Where I thought Sorkin did a good job, after time, the movie is at best campy portrayal of the men in uniform. As someone who served on a wall waiting for an enemy in (West) Germany, I am offended by the movie. I am glad for the Demi Moore line of giving thanks to those who protect freedoms.I think the actors did the best with what they were given.Third, the movie is flat. Once you know crescendo line, the movie falls. The script just has luck involved.Not really a good movie."
3,"Sorry to say, not a good game.","First of all, let me say that my daughter LOVES anything Teletubbies,and probably doesn't recognize the flaws in this game. However, as an adult, I see some problems. The plastic inserts are difficult to keep in place, and the spinning bush is difficult to spin. On the other hand, it is a game where everyone wins, and the fun is just in jumping up and down and generally acting like teletubbies. So, if you don't care if the pieces fit together correctly, it can still be fun."
5,One of the all time best!!!!!!!!!!!,"Definitely one of the best casts and story ever. Cary Grant, Katherine Hepburn (her best role), and Jimmy Stewart. Watch this video then find a movie called ""bringing up baby"", with Hepburn and grant in a classic comedy that actually bombed when released. Both good movies for men and women, not too heavy and very entertaing. A must see END"
3,Average Film,"I really didn't see what made this such a ""great"" film. It was not bad and somewhat entertaining. However, it was, in my opinion, no greater than many other romantic comedies of that era. I actually fell asleep on it twice."
5,awesome movie,this is an incrediable movies staring 3 of the best actors of all time. cary grant and katharine hepburn are my favorite actors. I wish people still made movies like this one.
4,Comfy and Hilarious :) Get the right size!,"I bought these for myself because they're hilarious. Never mind whether Freud was a nutjob or not. Anyways, to give you an idea on the sizing, I'm a mens shoe size 10. I bought the medium slippers, and they technically fit, but I think the large would have been more comfy. And if you're buying these for yourself, it's worth knowing that they aren't quite traditional slippers. Your toes go into the tongue, which is basically a sock. Just so you know. They are comfy slippers for sure though!"
5,Angels Fall,"The story is all about a girl who experienced a horrible tragedy in her life and hit the road, trying to escape reality. She settles in a small tourist town and faces even more challenges. Justice does prevail, but there is a surprise in the end. You will love it! If I could, I would give it 6 stars instead of 5.Marty WurtzAuthor of Deceptions and Betrayals"
3,Not too thrilling,"Reece Gilmore, a victim of a restaurant spree killing, lands in Angel's Fist Wyoming after fleeing her bad memories in Boston. Her bad luck continues as Reece witnesses a murder while she was hiking, but when she got help, the body and and evidence of a crime was gone.I was very entertained for the first 100 pages of the story. The set-up of the plot was good, and the characters were interesting. I'm not sure what happened, but the story really started to drag. I did like the heroine's spunkiness, but it wasn't enough to save a substandard plot. For a really good Nora Roberts novel read SANXCTUARY instead."
2,Something new please!!,"After I had finished reading this book,I just want to scream. I had paid almost 20 bucks and what I got was nothing new. The love story was just lame and Brody was not a kind of hero that make my knees weak. The plot and story lines were familiar with her former books. Maybe it is because I have read a lot of her books so I didn't fine something new and exciting anymore. You know I have discovered the new author that I really enjoyed reading again. Nothing to fear or you can't hide from Karen Rose were the better choice for suspense novel today"
2,Meh ....,"I love Nora Roberts' books. But this was just meh. I thought the writing was mediocre in some parts. This could be because I listened it on CD ... but still, it was just meh."
3,Not the best,"This is not one of Nora Roberts triumphs. To me, the characters seemed a little one dimensional. The premise was good the execution not so good. On the other hand, its Nora Roberts - what can you say?"
1,Most Predictable Book I've Ever Read,"This book was so predictable. I knew who the killer was half way through the book. The characters were good, thats about it. It's not a good suspense novel."
4,Almost perfect,"I'm a little wary of Roberts, I own almost all of her books but can't stand several (Daring to dream series yuck!).This book was great, the heroine was strong and faced difficult choices. The hero was actually quite funny (the wedding soup scene and the shopping scene). I loved the supporting characters. My only complaint was that the villian was a little too abvious. I actually knew right at the beginning of the murder. Don't miss this one- I don't believe I'll be loaning it out!"
3,Didn't dazzle me like other Noras,"I loved the beginning and then it fizzled for me. I thought the victim got what she desserved and hated to see what I perceived as a generally good person destroy his and his family's life/lives. Would have liked if Nora had made a killer I could despise. Also seemed like the action was sparce, and I didn't really come away from it loving any of the characters as I normally do with a Nora book."
4,Fattening,"My second Nora Roberts read, Sanctuary was the first. Liked them both, but couldn't understand why my diet was no longer working. Both books describe food in great detail, sending me in search of it. The romance and mystery were neatly balanced. I look forward to reading more of Nora Roberts."
4,Great for first-time Nora Roberts readers!,"Angels Fall is a great introduction for first time Nora Roberts readers; it embraces her unique approach to creating appealing characters, contains romance and suspense, as well as beautiful descriptions of the Wyoming country.It may be a little long, and a little slow in the beginning, but it is a good ""cozy-time"" read."
5,"Excellent, excellent.....excellent","When I see a new book by Nora Roberts, I just have to have it for my collection! She is by far one of my favorite authors! Angels Fall did not disappoint. I loved the characters Reece, Brody, Linda-gail, Joanie and Lo and the setting in the Grand Tetons. The story was great and I honestly could not figure out ""who-done-it"" til the end! Please write more books like this!"
1,Who thought this would make a good movie?,"I never saw the movie but I did have the misfortune to read this book. It was a Christmas present so I felt obliged to finish it. I've read romance novels for years, this is the only Nora Roberts book that I have hated. The main characters are annoying and their interest in each other is unbelievable. There is was no excitement between them and by the end of the book I was hoping the killer would whack Reece to put her out of her misery. Usually Nora's secondary characters are interesting enough to want to keep reading...but not this time, except maybe the killer. However, even after the killer's motive is revealed it is so lame the book was still boring. Don't even waste your money on a used copy. Try a Judith McNaught book if you want a good romance. Now I know why they are putting author blogs with their books, so you will get distracted and not read the reviews of the book."
2,a real snoozer,"The first Nora Roberts novel I read was Northern Lights, and I was pleasantly surprised by the strong sense of locale, interesting and believable characters, and a well-crafted and exciting plot. Angels Fall sounded like it would follow in the same genre, but it is more a gushy romance novel than a thriller. This time the hick town location is cliched and dull, as are the characters (especially the heroine). I started this book on a ten-hour plane trip, and put it down after a couple hours. A month later I'm still only half way through it; in the last ten chapters not much has happened."
2,"What, no pause and serve?","Pros: The coffee comes out hot and keeps the coffee hot for a few hours.Cons: Unfortunately, I have alot of these.- The travel mug lids are very poorly designed- They're just plain awkward for drinking out of and could very likely end up on my clothes.- The inside of the pot shattered one morning - It's a thermos type carafe with glass. I don't really know why it happened but the coffee had been sitting for about 15 minutes after brewing and it just exploded inside. The internal container is not encased so the coffee came right through all over the kitchen counter before I made it out to see what exploded in the kitchen.- The bigger problem is that there is no pause and serve. When I bought it I didn't check that it had the feature because I can't even imagine that a coffee maker would be made without PAUSE AND SERVE. I wanted to return upon purchase but because it had good reviews (I think in consumer reports) I decided to give it a try."
2,Poor design and clumsy,"I was excited to purchase this since the concept seemed great. But when I actually tried using it, I noticed that the heating element didn't shut off when the water was gone, and even after running through a couple of cycles to clean it out good, my coffee still tasted like plastic. It's hard to see the markings in the water reservoir when you are filling it, and I found the carafe lid to be clumsy. The last few ounces in the pot were very difficult to pour. I did like that the carafe was glass-lined, but alas, by the time the coffee got to the pot, it already tasted like plastic.Also, it was annoying that to start brewing you always have to depress the brew button twice (where once puts you into automatic brew mode)."
2,Disappointed,"We liked the idea of a built-in thermal carafe. But this machine has drawbacks that has made it more of a disappointment than a boon to us:1) The clock isn't backlit.2) The carafe doesn't hold very much coffee. The carafe's bulk is misleading.3) The darn thing drips for several minutes after it has stopped percolating.4) Pouring coffee out of it is a challenge, especially if you're getting near the bottom of the carafe.5) The coffee doesn't stay warm for long, even with the extra-bulky carafe.It is not worth the money we spent. Looks good on the counter, though.It's inevitable that we have to sop up coffee from somewhere every time we use it. Frankly, I want to drink it, not have it end up in a kitchen rag.Recommendation: Buy a Mr. Coffee and a good Thermos carafe (we got ours at a thrift shop for a quarter; it keeps coffee hot for 24 hours!)."
1,Drips like crazy and coffee tastes like plastic,"We have had this coffee maker at work now for about 3 months and it is driving me nuts. It drips (a lot) if you use the carafe to pour water into the resevoir, and it drips when you pour a cup of coffee. Consequently, I am constantly having to clean up the kitchen counter and the floor underneath (and sometimes the cabinet door and drawer).The coffee tastes really bad - often it tastes kind of like plastic - to the point hwere I am wondering if there is just something wrong with my unit. Is the water too hot? I don't know what wrong with it... would never urge anyone to buy this model."
2,Awful Plastic Taste,"Bottom line: this machine has some nice features but I could never get past the terrible plastic aroma and taste of the coffee. If you want to know the taste of your coffee, stick your nose in the water well. I ran vinegar, water and about 5 coffee cycles thru to make sure it just wasn't something that would go away with use. I can't imagine even the casual coffee drinker not noticing this problem. Also doesn't make much coffee and does not pour well out of the carafe. Mine's going back."
2,"It's OK, but wouldn't buy it again","I liked this chair at first, but I was a new mom and really didn't know what else was out there. The biggest problem for me is that the straps have never been snug enough to keep my daughter seated. As soon as she learned how to stand up, she was always climbing out of it (even when you make the straps as tight as possible). Even now, at 2 1/2 years old, she still gets right out of the 5-point harness without unbuckling it. Very dangerous and I can never take my eyes off of her. I do agree with the other reviewers that it is very hard to clean and you have to wash the tray by hand because it is so big. I took the pad off months ago and it's ugly but at least I can just wipe it. I am now pregnant with my 2nd and will be looking for a different chair. This one is just too annoying. The wheels are its best feature and that's not saying much. You think you need a recliner, but you really don't."
3,I HATE THE COVER,"This is a great looking high chair with lots of great options for seat hight adjustment and recline. I love the double tray.However, the cloth cover does not seem to even have a scotch guard coating. I need to wash this cover weekly and even then as soon as I put it back on my daughter's high chair she touches it with sticky hands or drops something in it. IT ALWAYS LOOKS DIRTY. I think I have an unusually messy eater...BUT I don't know of any infant/toddler who is learning to eat and then later feed themselves that doesn't make a mess. The cover is so impractical. Even worse is the fact that after a just a few times washing it on the gentle cycle and hanging to dry, one of the seams began to rip and fray.I am very disappointed. This is the only baby item that I will definately replace if we have another baby."
2,Don't ignore the bad reviews!,"I read the reviews for this high chair and thought the positive comments far outweighed the negative ones, so I bought it. Big mistake! For me the cons far outweigh the pros of this chair. My biggest annoyance, now that my daughter is feeding herself, is that the chair cover is hard to clean. After several washings the cover looks very faded. If you have a messy eater then this chair isn't for you.Pros-tray easy to remove-folds up easily-reversible chair cover-reclines and height adjustCons-cover hard to keep clean-tray doesn't fit in dishwasher-tray too high- doesn't work with our table (high chair has to be adjusted so low that my daughter's eyes are level with the table)"
1,Terrible waste of paper,"Proper placement of mirrors is an essential design strategy when attempting to alter the perception of space; I was hoping this book would educate me further on the subject. I now believe that I know more about mirrors than the authors do. Good thing I borrowed it from the library.It truly boggles the mind that a book like this can getpublished. One could flip through the Sears catalogue and glean about the same level of information. This book is paper-thin, seems to have been thrown together wily-nily, and does not offer one iota of interest."
1,dog cable,I install this product the first day and my dog broke it the second day. It was really too flimsy. not stong at all. This might work for a small dog. I have a meduim size german shepard. still a puppy. I was surprised as to how weak it was.
4,How to sue for Peace AND keep your day job.,"With war on the near horizon Nobby and Colon are the last two we'd expect the Patrician to seek out as trusted aides, but then this is Pratchett, who can make even this, one of the lesser Disk novels, a mind opening wonder. How the Patrician sues for Peace is alone worth the asking price."
5,Worth it's weight in gold!,"I used Mr. Ferguson's book (the first edition) when we built our home several years ago, finishing in 2002. I found it to be the best book out there for the layperson on the home construction process. It gave me a starting point in discussing important concerns regarding design and materials with contractors and builders. With the combination of a very good architect, foreman and ""Build it Right!"", we came within 2% of our budget, which is very good, considering the size of our home and that we required a 180-foot retaining wall that was not initially needed (and we chose to make it out of natural stone.) I recommend this book all the time to my friends who are building. Yes, you do have to adhere to the codes in your area, but for general planning and understanding, this book can't be beat!"
4,For new people,"So, in case you've just arrived on Earth today, and, for some reason, Lensman is the first movie you've decided to watch, I'd just like to tell you it's different from the book.Now, for anyone who as been on this planet for MORE THAN A DAY, you would already obviously know that movies are different from the books they are based on. I mean, you'd have to have some sort of serious problems with your home life to have to come here and tell people the book was different from the movie. As someone who went to see ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" last week, I can tell you that the trend is very unlikely to be a passing phase that only the people who did the ""Lensman"" movie were into.Now, to blow your mind, I'll even tell you Captain America wasn't in the Avengers comics to start with. He's in the movie, though. It's called poetic license."
5,GREAT BOOK,I used this book when I was trying to get my new house organized. It had helpful ideas for each room in the house. It was a long book...but was easy to read. You can also jump from chapter to chapter depending upon your current needs.

Since the topics are prsented in lists, it is very brief and helpful for a quick reference."
2,Pretty Bad...,It is pretty hard to do especially if you have small hands. I would not recommend. It was disappointing but it gave me extra balls for my cups and balls routine.
4,Cute story,"Written in 1958, it is a cute little story for 3 and up. Might Mouse appears fairly late in the story."
4,Worked well under Wine for Ubuntu.,"I was suspect about it working under Linux, however Wine pulled through.I'm using Ubuntu. I copied all the contents of the DVD and run it locally."
1,Not a good product,"After asembly it continues to fall apart, is not build to last, is not practical at all, you dont even get what you paid for, is a cheaply made."
1,Buy something else,"The directions were ridiculously convoluted. The only real way to figure it out is to look at the picture on the box.Secondly and most importantly, figure out how you will be using it and then then glue it together or you'll be putting it back together every time you use it."
1,...it...could be good...for someone...,"It was annoying to put together, and has since fallen apart several times in my car. If you put a few bags of cotton balls in it, maybe it would be useful. But if you put anything of any substantial weight in it don't expect it to stay assembled."
4,I Was Surprised At How Good He Was,I had seen a previous stand up of Eddie griffin's and it was no where near as funny or insightful as this one is.Eddie is definitely a Top class comedian and entertainer.
4,Robert Irving III - Midnight Dream,Robert Irving III's debutalbum is a smoking device in between Fusion and Funk-Soul. The keyboardplayer formerly with the Miles Davies Band delivers some very to the point compositions. Some instrumentals and some vocal tunes. Very well recorded and some of the vocalsongs could easily be hits in the R'n'B/Funk-Fusion/Soul area. Maybe some people that heard him with Miles Davies would prefer him to make an exclusive Fusion-Jazz album. I think that the mixes of styles on this album do work. Listen and enjoy!Kenneth Skoog
2,Desiluso,"I don't like it. It's boring, tedious and uninteresting. One star for the album, an aditional one for LTJ career. I respect him but i don't like this record."
4,A wonderful book by Janette Oke!,"I think all 13 - 18 year old girls should read The Tender Years by Janette Oke. It really teaches and tells that in your teens, life just doesn't seem to go your way. Everything seems to wrong. No matter if it's your family or friends; life just seems confusing and frustrating. I also think 13 - 18 year old girls should read this book, because they could, at least, compare themselves to one part of this book. And I'm sure most could relate to the problems the main character, Virginia, goes through. I know this mostly because I'm going on 14 and can relate my friends and me, to this book. You should really pick this book up and give it a try...and it's not just for teen girls either...if you have kids or are planning on them the Tender Years might help you understand your kids a little more."
2,Superficial,"The book is quite superficial, it states the obvious and does not go enough into detail in order to be of any practical value."
5,this kettle has done us well,"I'm surprised to read some of these reviews. We've had this kettle for 2 years, and it works as well as it did when we bought it. I think it looks great, is very easy to keep clean and looking new, and boils water like it's supposed to. Yeah, I guess the body gets hot, but that's what the handle is for. I like mine enough that I'm buying one this christmas for friends."
5,4 years and still going strong!,"I felt compelled to write a review seeing how many negative reviews this electric kettle had! I'm surprised many had theirs malfunction or stopped working since I've had mine for close to 4 years now. I love this as it boils water instantly! With this, you can literally fall asleep without worrying about setting your apt on fire because this has an automatic shut-off feature once the water has come to a boil. I can't go back to a regular stove top kettle as those take two times longer to boil and you would still need to manually turn the flame off once it starts to whistle."
1,Don't buy this.,Some serious design flaws as the other reviews have already detailed. It basically died on me in a few months.
1,Very Poor Quality,"I had this kettle for about one month when the light stoped working. About five days after that, it stopped working all together. I took the base apart to see if I could fix it and found that wires had shorted together, burned off the insulations and fused themselves. I feel luck that this did not start a fire. Stay away from this product."
2,Go with another brand.,"I've had this kettle for 11 months and it is not longer working properly, unlike other reviews here mine does not shut off unless I manually do it, so it will boil forever. The pot gets VERY hot and it does leak around the bottom and the handle. I would go with another brand for the money."
5,Hamilton Beach Stainless Steel Electric Kettle,Completely satisfied it boils fast and looks great on the kitchen counter. From England so used a lot for cups of tea.Have tried several makes but cant beat this for quality and price M.Williams
4,Size Instructions,"We purchased a pair for my husband and myself and had to return them because we doubted the size chart and ordered a size up from recommended. Do not do this. We reordered and got our second pairs in short time and they fit well. There is a little room in the leg but not much. The shipping was great and the quality is great for the price. I am a size 4, thigh measures 21.5 at 5'8"" and the xs is what I got the second time around. The small was way to big and the XS fits with some room. My husband is a 34x36 and the large fit him well. Follow the size chart and you should be fine."
3,SLED 10 CBT CD - Very Basic Assistance,"I really pondered over whether or not I would purchase this item and actually only did so when I found the price to be greatly reduced over what I found on Novell's site. This may be a good offering for those having little to no experience with SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 and more specifically, the applications available with the operating system, ie. Firefox, OpenOffice, and Banshee to mention a few. Those who have greater experience may want to pass."
4,"Great concept, watch out for UV damage","Great concept that works as advertised. The range is very dependent on water pressure (you should use 3/4"" hose for best results) and not hook it in series with other watering items. The UV rays will damage the red adjustment circle over time (making it thin and crack; Gilmour did replace under warranty) so it's best to cover it with tape or make a ""hat"" for it. Also if the adjustment levels go immediately from really low to really high it can get caught."
2,Great performance but..............,This sprinkler does all that it states it is supposed to do. I enjoyed the fact that I could set the sprinkler to water the areas that I want and it didn't matter how the area was shaped. This sprinkler is made of a cheap plastic and it broke on the 5th use. So I'm out the money and the item does not work.
5,Innovative Sprinkler Design by Gilmour,"I have used this sprinkler now for two months. It's great. It solves the problem of watering a rectangular area with a sprinkler that waters in an arc. It does this by allowing you to adjust the spray distance throught the entire arc. No other pulse sprinkler does this. Takes a bit of playing with to get the pattern right, but once set it distributes the water right where you want it, without overspraying some areas and underwatering others. Very affordable too!"
3,Not too bad for the price.,"The sprinkler works as advertised, but the control ring could be more precise. There are adjustments every 30 degrees of rotation, and several distance stops at each location. It helps to have an adjustment valve at your faucet. There are two other sprinklers similar to this, but they cost 120 and 300 dollars. One is a gear drive sprinkler using a ring of about 50 set screws for adjustment, the other is an electronic wonder from Germany."
1,Waste of money!!!!,"I've been searching for a reliable sprinkler for years. As far as I'm concerned, a sprinkler has to last 2-3 full seasons and it has to offer good distance and good left to right controls for those odd shaped parts of your lawn. That's why I bought this sprinkler, and I'm here to tell you it was a waste of money!I bought it a year and a half ago, and it work great, until 2 weeks ago. It just stopped rotating. I'm good to my equipment, so it wasn't because I'm out there dropping or dragging my sprinkler. The darned thing just stopped working, so I took it back to the store and got it replaced, thanks to the ""lifetime gurantee"". Lifetime, what a joke!I got a replacement, same make and model and took it home, and guess what, there very first time I used it, it stopped rotating!!!!!! This is not rocket science, I just hooked it up and set it down, and bingo, it stops rotating after just one left to right movement.If you see a Gilmour product, run!!! WASTE OF MONEY, TIME AND EFFORT!!!!"
2,"A neat idea, but ...","This might be fantastically customizable, but since it lacks an accompanying manual or instructions, it's just a big wet paperweight to me."
4,"not the best collection, but nonetheless great","I've got several problems with coxsone's selections for foundation ska. He somehow neglected to include such staples as ""Guns of navarrone"" and ""Phoenix City."" Moreover, because Heartbeat records deals only with Coxsone dodd, you don't get any of those justin yap - produced gems like Confucius et al. Still, for the dedicated skatalite fan, this is a must-have."
2,my betta said no,i bought this for my betta fish because of the price and reviews. I figured there was no harm and fish food is fish food. Wrong. I used this for about three days. even after three days of not eating anything the betta refused to eat it and i ended up going out and buying the pellets again. It might be because my betta is a female and all men know they can be fussy eaters when someones watching but your fish just may love the stuff.
2,Arrived with broken handle - poorly casted.,"Looking at the reviews below, this product seems to routinely arrive with at least one broken handle. The boxes are not properly shipped, and the casting of the pans themselves appears poor. Returned the one I received (with broken handle) and went back to using a stone."
5,Great Pizza Pan.,"I used store bought pizza dough and the pan delivered a nice crispy crust. Here's a hint: roll out or stretch the dough on parchment paper, then transfer the parchment and all directly to the preheated pan. No cleaning of the kitchen counter or the pan!"
4,The Best,I have know Billy all my life and I am best friends with his daughter. I think this CD is the best blues CD that I have ever heard. He has changed my whole prospective of the blues. On the weekends when we go out we ride around listening to it. My favorite song is song three. Billy is a wonderful man and he sings so good. You should really buy his CD.
4,Very Good,The Cage Match was better than most that I Have Seen and there was very good wrestling in this one.I just wish Michael Hayes would come back to WCW and Begin Wrestling again.The same goes for Jimmy Garvin.
1,No muy contneto,"Este Producto producto solo trabaja con siertas trajetas de sonido, tube que adquirir la correcta para poderlo usar, pero el sofware que se trae tiene funciones muy limitadas, ademas tuve que adquirir un software de terceros para usarlo como queria."
5,Card's ABSOLUTE VERY BEST,"No one is doing in any genre of the publishing world (mainstream/sf/fantasy) what Mr. Card is doing. The mixture of fabulation, history, time-travel, and sheer magic pushes Mr. Card into the realm of writers such as Italo Calvino, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Jorge Luis Borges and John Fowles. His imaginative capacities are seemingly boundless, his writing style absolutely engaging, first word to last. This is the breakthrough novel for Mr. Card, pure and simple and should bring more readers back to his other masterpiece, HART'S HOPE. If I wore a hat, I'd take it off in a grand salute to this man and this masterpiece. (But no sequels, please. Onward and upward!)"
5,Intelligent Fantasy,"This is intelligent fantasy at it's best. I love the way Orson Scott Card portrays women; strong minded, not the usual ""damsel-in-distress"" you see in most fantasy novels. Great, easy read, for when you need some escapism!"
5,"Excellent, Excellent Story","Orson Scott Card's ""Enchantment"" is a truly wonderful book. From the very first line to the very ending, it's all-around excellent: excellent writing, excellent (and clever) story, excellent characters, and excellent character development. One of the nicest aspects of the book is that he folds the philosophical side of things right into the plot so that it's a natural thought process to go through it. Several of the books I've been reading recently just drop that kind of material in like a rock into a pond. Again, it's a wonderful book and I rate it an Excellent 5 stars out of 5."
4,Great Deal!!,This product was a great deal. It arrived in great condition and on time. Will buy from this seller again.
3,Not worth the money!,"I'm reviewing this for the product but have not purchased from Amazon. I get this at the department store. I'm a male, have combination, olive tone skin that isn't sensitive or acne prone.This is a very good, basic cleanser that can be used by anyone. I like the packaging and feel that this is appropriate for male or females. However, this is not worth the money. You'd be better off with Purpose Gentle Cleansing for like $5."
4,Great cleanser!,This cleanser deep-cleans (wash & rinse twice to remove make-up and cleanse skin) and manages to remove oil without drying out your skin.
5,works great!,"I have tried pretty much everything out there. Anything you can buy in the grocery store, mail order products like proactive etc. I picked up a bottle of this at a spa b/c it is what they used at their business for a facial. It works great. I have super sensitive skin and although some other products were ok, I was alway blotchy and have a hard time with adult acne. I have mixed skin and it can never decide if it is dry or oily. This WORKS! It is very gentle on my skin and I don't need to put any cream or moisturizer on afterwards."
2,Just trying to save money but go with a better brand on this part,For whatever reason this sensor caused my ignition/injector timing to get so seriously screwed up the car had no power upon acceleration whatsoever. Once i pulled it out and replaced it with an AC Delco all was good.
2,Best thing about it was the cover,"Sorry, Ms. Lau! I awaited the release of this book for a long time, and was sorely disappointed. The book claimed to give information about sibling relationships, and it did talk about birth order, but there was nothing about how compatible the signs were. The whole organization of the book was clunky, and the passages felt rushed and flippant. I wish more time had been spent on content and really exploring family relationships in terms of the Chinese zodiac. The topic is compelling but unfortunately it wasn't treated here in a way that gives the reader any real insight. Save your pennies and spend it on Lori Reed's Complete Book of Chinese Horoscopes (I think it's out of print but still findable), which has info on children's personalities and then some."
4,Hey Amazon/Mr. Scott Holter - You're Wrong,"Hey,Guess what, Scott? You're wrong.The last time Bruce Springsteen ventured West for inspiration, the result WAS NOT not the album Nebraska, of 1982, but instead IT WAS the album The Ghost of Tom Joad, of 1995, with its tales of immigrants and the difficult lives they faced in South Western America. This is one more reason why AMAZON.COM refers to it as Nebraska II.Get to know your Springsteen a little better before you write a review on it."
2,Bruce Springsteen Dust and Devils,I'm a Bruce fan. There's been a lot of media blitz for this project.But the fact remands it's not a great album. There is the title cut which I think is good and the song The Hitter. I would rate the remanding tracks as fillers. I was interested in the 5:1 and the dual disc technology as much as the album itself.If you want a great Bruce album check out The River or Nebraska.Maybe a live album of the tour to those who bought this album and spent their hard made money could save this project and face.
2,devils indeed,"As much as I loved the features and music from Bruces' 30th anniv. Born to Run package, I disliked Devils & Dust. I am about 2 weeks older than Mr.Springsteen and have most of his music, seen him preform 6 times. the last in early 2002. I enjoyed the acoustic parts of the concert and the RIsing cd very much. But this one excapes me and doesn't touch what I love about his lyricism, use of instrumentation, and ability to put simple concepts into complex settings, or complex feelings into simple yet elegant lyrics...on Devils he puts highly personal and obscure messages into obscure settings. I wish for more poetry as found on his first three albums and tunnel of love. I hope others will find these songs more personal to them, I just can't find my way into them, didn't like Nebraska or Tom Joad either.sorry, Bruce...seadog"
1,Beware: Don't use in slot loading multi-disc CD players,"There was a post from another reviewer about waiting for jams in slot-loading players...well, here you go. I would love to buy this CD, but I can't, because the new Fiona Apple DualDisc jammed my six-disc Rockford Fosgate in my 2005 Nissan when I put it in my player in the record store parking lot! And it took two months to have my CD player replaced. Anyone who buys this format must know you are taking a 50-50 chance in damaging your CD player. I had to buy Fiona again on iTunes and then burn a cd for my car. A real ripoff.I hate giving Bruce one star, but this rating will get others to read this post and hopefully not ruin their Nissan car stereos."
3,Beware of dual disc format!,Love the songs. Love the DVD portion. But the dual disc format will not play in my car's CD player. A pamphlet included with the dual disc states that the audio portion of the disc might not be compatible with certain CD players. My car's CD player falls in that category. It's such a shame because I think there's no better place to listen to a Springsteen CD than the open road.... Give me a low-tech CD any day!
1,Unfortunately for Bruce's fans- it's over...,I have not bought this cd but have heard several tracks from it and will save myself some money. I honestly don't know how anyone can give this cd 5 stars...what are they smoking?? Bruce has NO voice left...in its place is some kind of forced muttering from someone who sounds like they ingested a large amount of rat poisen. The lyrics are uncreative and boring...nothing resembling his past brilliance. And the music...all I can do is shake my head and feel sorry for a great artist that has overstayed his welcome among the musical elite. I have loved Bruce's music and genius my whole life which makes it really hard to see him tarnish such a great career with such a woeful attempt at singing and songwriting. Please give it up Bruce- this is one fan who will never buy another one of your albums but instead will break out something from many years ago that will stay great forever.
1,wish i could rate less than zero,Some guy from New Jersey putting on a phony southern accent.Some people should stop recording and just go away
1,terrible album,what a disappointment this year. bruce and u2 have three years to write albums and both stink.songs need melodies that you can recall to make them memorable.this album has no melodies.this is his worse album ever.no good songs.the rising had two great songs in my opinion-marys place and city of ruins and three to four good songs.i cannot understand how anyone likes this cd. and i am a big bruce fan and love him in concert.this and my new u2 cd are going in the garbage.
2,Devils & Bust,"Opinions are like U know what, and everyone has one but heres my 2 cents. This CD is no Rising. Just when Bruce had a fresh sound and on top of the world with the Rising Tour, he goes back and puts out another Ghost Of Tom Joad CD. UGH. I dont enjoy listening to Bruce Dylan, I mean Springsteen drowne on with an acoustic guitar. I think he is taking himself way too seriously. I love Bruce but he really needs a band to enhance his music. I want to love this CD, Ive given it a few listens and it just doesnt click or keep my attention. The E Street band is becoming more and more important cuz this crap doesnt fly. Nebraska and Joad are 2 coasters. I want to hear another Rising CD, power, catchy tunes, great production, great lead and backing vocals. Even another Tunnel Of Love would be great but hearing Bruce mumble with a guitar is good sleep aid. Good night!"
5,Man I Love This Album!,I can't say it any better than that!Fits perfectly in a nearly perfect body of work.
2,More Dust than Devil,"I can't say I have ever been a huge Springsteen fan. His big BIG albums I have tended to stay away from, though even they contained some really nice underrated songs (""Downbound Train"").For all his E Street over-the-top songs, I always gravitated to the more stripped down, bare bones songs the band did (""Point Blank"", ""The River""). The more he stripped away the band, the more I enjoyed his music - most of 'Tunnel of Love' and half of 'The Rising'.'Nebraska' was a watershed moment for him, in my opinion. Great songs. No band. Low budget. One of those albums you really listen to - that can't just be background music. American storytelling, if you will. But 'Devils & Dust' is no 'Nebraska'. It has some good qualities to it - but nothing that captured my attention or grabbed me where I had to go back for a second listen.Perhaps it will grow on me over time. It is certainly not an easy listen. Time will tell."
4,"E Street Fan, Not a Nebraska Fan. But...","I have Nebraska and respect it but don't love it. I love The River, Darkness, etc. I didn't care for Tom Joad until Rage Against The Machine got their hands on it and blew me away. I saw the acoustic tour in '96 and it was more interesting than enjoyable for me.All that said, Devils and Dust just knocks me out. Talk about cutting to the heart of the matter, amazing,"
3,Its NO Rising,"AFter being amazed at The Rising, I was so excited to pick up D&D and listen to it immediately! I have to say that I was disappointed. This album is good, but its just not full of life. Its good to fall asleep to or get drunk with. The songs dont really differ from one another in feel? I thought that the title would at least lay the line for some good rock songs, but it fails to deliver. All in all, its a good album, but it never rocks."
4,Exellent Seller,"I purchase this from Direct Auto for my truck, since the moment I installed it was kind of slow bringing the window up, but I did not mind it. About six month later it just failed it wouldn't move up or down luckily it happened with the window up. I contacted the seller via email explaining the problem and asking them about warranty. To my surprise they actually called me on my phone to apologize for the failure and to let me know that they will be sending a replacement part which I received some days later. This new part is working 100%, window goes up and down like the other side. I highly recommend this vendor, things will break and some times even arrive broken, but how a vendor stands behind the product they sell really is the important part"
5,Good little calculator,Used by various committees to tally votes and no complaints. We are looking forward to using these calculators for many years.
5,Thrilling and Fun!,"If you had this game as a kid, Im sure you remember the excitement and anticipation in waiting for your turn to tap the ""ice"". This game was (and still is) amazingly fun and exciting. I played recently with my nieces and it was funny to see the same excitement that Im sure I had at their age. This game is a crowd pleaser. Dont miss it!"
2,A bit LOUD. Young kids need parent involvement.,"The noise of the hammers hitting the plastic blocks can be ear piercing. We put little felt pads on the hammers. Still works just as well, but avoids the loud CLACK. Young children may not have the dexterity or finger strength to reset the game after each round. I think there are better classic toy choices that teach similar mechanics such as Jenga, Ker Plunk, and Don't Spill the Beans."
3,goes too fast,My boys (2 and 4) love this game. It's inexpensive and simple. The get a huge kick out of hammering the ice blocks. My complaint it that it takes about a minute to set all the cubes back in place and about 10 seconds for them to finish it off. It gets frustrating and tedious (for them and me) to keep setting it up.
1,Slowest movie EVER!! DO NOT waste your time.,"This movie bored me to sleep and I'm an insomniac. It moved at the pace of paint drying and the acting was about as no more interesting. I want that wasted time back, life is too short!"
3,Good Price Somewhat Natural,Although it still has other chemicals its still a good product it smells good and is not pricy. It is a good starter product for health fanatics.
5,Awesome Product,"This deodorant combines two things that I find most important in a deodorant. I live in South Louisiana and garden year round. This product works in my hot climate. Also, this deodorant doesn't leave white marks on my clothing. It is an awesome product that I use twice daily and highly recommend."
1,"Run, don't walk away from this product -wish zero stars were allowed",This is by far the worst deodorant I've ever used. It doesn't stop BO and only adds the smell of cheap Mexican laundry detergent to the mix. Yuck! It's so bad I stopped using it before I even found a replacement. I ordered it because the UNSCENTED variety of this brand I used for years and loved is apparently no longer available. I figured the Aloe scented one couldn't be too bad. WRONG! Too late now for a refund so the two I bought are headed for Goodwill or a landfill... :(
4,Great deodorant!,This deodorant works great for me as I am allergic to almost every other product on the market including all antiperspirants. There are no irritating ingredients. It doesn't sting or cause any bad reactions. Love it!
5,Great Product! Great Seller!,"I fell in love with this deodorant because it does not contain aluminum, which the human body can not break down. Unfortunately, the store that I used to buy it from stop carrying it. Well this online seller has it and my buying experience has been great. Pricing is a little more than I was paying for at the store, but the selection is greater and shipping and processing is quick."
4,"You don't have to love dogs, but it won't hurt","If you are a dog person, ""Distemper"" will grab you by the scruff of your neck from its opening pages. And if you're not a dog person, it will still grab you by the scruff of your neck. Literate, fun, compelling, and downright thought-provoking are adjectives that came to mind as I prepared these comments. I judge my mysteries by how early in the book I correctly identify the bad person/people; in a good one, you want to do so near the end, but not from so far out in left field that you never had a chance. [That's just MY opinion, of course.] In ""Distemper"", it's perfect. The setting, of course, is Ithaca, N.Y. (""Gabriel, N.Y."") and ""Benson University"" is Cornell. But even a Stanford graduate will like this one. Author Beth Saulnier has a near-perfect ear for dialog. And she knows her dogs ! She also chooses interesting names for her characters, an assortment of interesting, if neurotic, people. Rover, sit ! Do not eat this book ! Read it !"
2,Meh...,"I've got a room mate that swears by these. I bought a few packs of these, and didn't notice a single difference in my memory/mental capacity, the way my room mate raves. I think it's more of a placebo for him."
1,"""Sink"" this one -- get a better book on Fitz","I did not even finish this book because I got so tired of Capt. Paquett's life story. I bought this book with the thought in mind that it was about the Fitz, not Capt. Paquett and his history. I am sure he was/is a great Capt. and I glad that he did as well as he did, but I wanted to read about the Fitz. Skip this book and get one of the other books on the Fitz offered by Amazon."
3,Not up to her standards,Diana is not at her best. Seems to have breath control problems. Big band arrangements are unimaginative and seem to clash with Diana rather than enhance her performance. Not nearly as good as the other seven Krall albums I enjoy.
2,Hard to understand what happened ...,"Like others, I thought that this CD was a big come-down from her earlier work, specifically, the live in Paris recordings. However, without putting too fine a point on it, my impression when listening to it a second time (of a total of two), was that my lack of enthusiasm might have been driven more by the selections, with the exception of the title song, or the instrumenation / recording (had to concentrate to hear her piano work) than from Diana, herself.She's a great! talent, get her Live in Paris DVD to be wowed!"
2,Disappointed in Diana,"I have been a Diana Krall fan for years. Have all her albums and play them regularly. I felt however that her heart simply was not in this album. The album lacked energy. Just to be sure, I gave it to another DK afficianado and she agreed with me. I trust that this is a career hiccup and not a trend."
2,I miss the influence of Elvis,"There's not a song on this CD that someone hasn't done better. As a standards singer, I rate Krall a 6. However, for her efforts on Girl in the Other Room plus her duets with Ray Charles (You Don't Know Me) and Willie Nelson (Crazy) I give her a 10. She apparently has traded in her newfound specialness and uniqueness for a return to what her old fans demand: mediocrity."
1,SIBILANT SOUNDS STIFFLE SULTRY SINGER,"HOW DID TIS WIN A GRAMMY UNLESS THE ACADEMY IS MADE UP OF SSSSSSNAKES!! a good TRAINED singer would leave there sibilant s behind. Listen to Liza for how a Pro does it, peo-ple!!"
5,very impressed,As soon as I heard this I thought Spineshank meets The Autumn Offering. I was disappointed when Santos left Spineshank but I was very pleased with this SC album. Typical metalcore with some above average solos but his vocals bring it over the top for me. Enjoyable album if you like metalcore with melodic choruses.
2,Yawn .....,"Does it seem to anyone else like the other three reviewers are all the same person? I think they must be, because I can't imagine more than one person finding this Haggadah a good one for children. There's nothing fun about it and much is such a literal translation of the Hebrew text that one might as well use an adult Haggadah."
2,room to breathe,i received this album and it contained a greatest hits album. was somewhat disappointed but i like debert anyway so i will keep and enjoy .
2,Go with a higher quality product,"The finish matches Delta's oil rubbed bronze well, but the durability of the finish is poor. The finish along the trip lever immediately started to wear away after just a few open and close cycles. The PVC drain piping is thin walled PVC which does not work well when screwing in metal hardware, such as the brass waste drain and the overflow plate screws."
3,Informative,I found this book to move slowly at times. I was very satisfied with the information given with regards to what Solomon does in the treatments. It was a learning experience.
2,now they are useless,"I had one of these things for a while. I loved it. Now they ""improved"" it. They made it more sensitive. What a nightmare! It used to have a 6'-10' range, now it sences eveything with in a 30' range. I was using it to keep one of my cats out of a corner that she liked to pee in. If I set up the new one, she can't even walk through the room.They should have put a control on this to adjust the distance that it picks up the collar's signal.I really wish the old one had not broken. :("
1,Like Most Products Today,"Another moral-free company in Florida or New York run out of someone's home or small warehouse and simply re-labels the worst Chinese products. I bet when you call product support you'll hear the ""CEOs"" wife or child in the background yelling. Oh yeah, the ""product"", it didn't even work and when I tested the ""9 volt"" power supply it measures at 16 Volts, which is why it probably doesn't work."
3,Shocked disappointed,"With ""A lot of bottle"" no longer available,Ivetried to make do with getting all the tracksammassed through compilations.But,when my copyof this arrived,I was ready to enjoy REAP WHATIVE SOWED when gasp,the entire middle section,THE lead solo of bottleneck slide.....EDITEDOUT!... was I upset! ONE more complaint,thetrack Hey Baby Everthings Gonna Be Alright YeahYeah Yeah sounds really suspicous,like its beenspeeded up,(time compressed?)and vocal removedwith a strange piano part that didnt seem to fitOther than these 2 misrepresentations the rem-ainder of the tracks sound great!"
2,Flimsy edges.,"This looked like a good utensil for using in my new non-stick pan for making scrambled eggs and such, but the leading edge on this spoon is just way too flimsy. It seems like there is about 3/4"" of silicon that overhangs the metal form, making the front edge just completely unsupported an unable to use for even scraping something soft like scrambled eggs. Poorly designed product."
4,The Best One,"First thing: this film has an unfortunate lack of horror for being a horror film, even by 1950s standards. I feel this could have been rather easily remedied without distorting the script so I detract one star. However, the story is so clever (the salient points were ripped off by, among others, NBC 15 years later in their made-for-TV ""Frankenstein: the True Story"" starring David McCallum and Michael Sarrazin) and Cushing's portrayal of the good doctor so absolutely perfect that it is worth watching over and over again primarily to see Dr. Frankenstein in his penultimate glory. This would be great remade with much more monster action and gore if it weren't for the fact that Mr. Cushing is no longer with us and, equally sad, Hollywood would probably find some cheap-visioned director to expensively butcher it. I feel this may have been Hammer's finest film."
2,BORING BORING BORING....,"Definitely not one of Hammer's better films. They just didn't know how to make a Frankenstein film. Cushing is back but the horror isn't. Again, acting and production values are fine---they just forgot to add the horror this time. Instead we have a dull movie that leaves you wondering what audience did they intend this for...you got a laboratory, a hospital, an assistant and a pretty girl but where's the monster? Just a fairly regular looking joe with stiches here and there. And he's literate! And he has a conscience. From a transplanted brain? I passed on this one and can't recommend it. I just don't see what other people see in it. It's just plain boring..."
4,Lovely Binoche !,"One of my favourite film with Binoche...a great movie, very well acted. Jeremy Irons at his best !I must admit that Juliette Binoche is my favourite french actress !"
5,give stars on costume presentation,If I were to have an affair with an older married man and wanted to keep him totally obsessed...I would dress like binoche...from basic black..to leather...to the just short enough skirts...black high heeled pumps...but not too high... to those lace thigh high black stockings...to the trench coat with just enough exposed wearing (guess what) high heeled shoes... to the minimalist diamonds and silver she wore....jeremy irons did not have a chance...totally visually seduced!
3,SOMETHING IS MISSING,"In the beginning the sons girl friend of a short time just happens to go meet the sons father on her own, then stares at him in a intense way, very deranged scene, where is the plot???. I gave this movie3 stars because the actors were so good."
1,An insult to my intelligence,"A man meets his son's girlfriend at dinner. The next day, she calls him and they MUST meet to start a torrid affair.This might work if ANY of the actors in this movie showed any emotion or passion, but they don't. I haven't seen acting this flat, this icy, or this bad in years.The whole premise is presented in such a completely gratuitous manner, as to suggest that the only purpose for this movie is to present Ms. Binoche's body for cheap thrills. Even the sex scenes are laughably contrived. Give me a break.If you want an excuse to watch ""soft-core,"" this is the movie for you, but if you're looking for a meaningful story to go along with the love scenes, try elsewhere."
1,A Prime Candidate for Mystery Science Theater !,"I saw this film in the theater when it was first released and it was so bad people were laughing at it. Where to begin? Another ""French Lieutenant's Woman""/obsessed guy performance by Jeremy Irons, Juliette Binoche as an antiques dealer who dresses exclusively in leather and can leave work whenever she wants for the truly ridiculous sex scenes (I particularly like it when Irons rhythmically bangs Binoche's head against the floor--that's a sure fire way to get a woman going!). You know you're in trouble when Irons rips Binoche's exquisite silk shirt and that causes you more angst than anything else in the film. And the ending is just ridiculous (where did he get that photo?) Miranda Richardson overcomes all to give a far better performance than this silly movie deserves. All in all a guilty pleasure, but I would pay big money to see what Mike or Joel and the bots could do with this one."
4,Another engrossing Coben read...,"I very much enjoyed the twists and turns of ""Tell No One."" Coben succeeds in writing a fascinating tale of intrigue and mystery. The characters are well drawn and you care for them. However, I read this book after ""Gone for Good."" I noticed many similar plot twists and characters. ""Gone"" kept ringing in my ears--the stories are different, but too many things reminded me of the other book. I don't want to be too specific and ruin it for those who have not yet read it, but the echoes are there. Still a fun, easy, and engrossing read."
2,Reads like a very forgettable movie....,"While reading this book I kept seeing it as so many of the movie thrillers that are out today. You spend a lot of money and walk out feeling like you have been ripped off, which, indeed you have been. On a positive note, I checked this book out from the library and didnt buy it.The reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I actually finished it and there was something that made me want to see how the whole bloody mess would finally end. What an unbelievable plot, flimsey characters and mediocre (at best!!) writing style.If you enjoy books that have some element of style and depth and memorable characters, then dont bother with this book. If you like poorly written books, with characters you could care less about then this may be the book for you.Im still shaking my head over all the positive reviews that made me want to read this book in the first place. I just dont get it!!!"
2,Weak,"Tell No One by Harlan Coben. What an apt title because you should tell no one to buy this book. Ok, it wasn't that bad, but I could not recommend it to anyone who likes a meaty book with depth.The whole story deals with a guy whose wife was supposedly murdered eight years ago and has now possibly come back from the dead by sending cryptic emails and webcams of herself. The book was so breezy! I read it very quickly as there was just nothing to it. The finish was so rushed and unfulfilling."
2,"Good enough, but the ending was out of nowhere...","It's written well enough, and I like the use of technology, esp. the way the author explains it to newbies. The final determination of the son's killer (though actually unimportant) strikes me as contrived....a final twist that adds little to the story, and is a bit of a bait-and-switch. Good enough for a summer weekend, but I wouldn't make a gift of it to anyone."
5,Excellent,"Tell no One is a high octane thriller which grabs you on page 1 and does not let go until page 339. This novel is a departure from Coben's Myron Bolitar series, And trust me you will not be disapointed. The suspense is so thick you can cut it with a knife and there are plot twists galore. As in all Coben novels you will be guessing right up till the end."
2,"okay BUT, not okay......","I got this book because I was indecisive and the books title was familar to me. The book was alright at best. It had the premis of a good plot. However, the characters are shallow and not well rounded. Also, the further you got in the book the more the plot took turns for the worse. You can read longer reviews if you want. Overall, it was a quick read and somewhat interesting. Not intellecutally stimulating."
4,Tell No One is Super-Charged Reading,"Harlan Coben's great talent is presenting an unusual premise to the reader and then hurtling him into a maze of fast paced plot twists. However, unlike many other mystery writers, Coben shows us the human side of the plot devices. His characters suffer and we empathize with their misery. In Tell No One, a young doctor loses his beautiful wife to a crazed killer. Or does he? Eight years after that fateful night, he receives a cryptic message that could only have come from his wife. Determined to know the truth, he soon realizes that other forces want to stop him, at any cost. A great beach read, Tell No One has enough energy to keep you reading long after the lifeguards have gone home.Donald Gallinger is the author of The Master Planets"
3,Enjoyable page-turner,"This book certainly held my interest. I stayed up way later than I should reading it. It's an engaging story, full of plot twists. Coben builds up a long, complicated plotline in the first half of the book, unveiling only a few clues. The clues come faster, almost too fast, in the latter fourth of the book.This a very easy read. The writing just flows. Some of the plot devices and characters were a bit contrived (one character early on who you knew was going to show up at the end to tie some things together). Still, a good book for a quick summer read."
5,Couldn't Put it Down,"I started Tell No One last night and finished it this afternoon. I had to force myself to put the book down and go to sleep! The action is non-stop and I hung on to every word.Coben does a great job developing his characters and I found myself really caring about, not only Dr. Beck - the main character, but the supporting characters as well. He managed to avoid sterotypes (in his portrayal of lesbians and drug dealers) and give each character a different edge.This is the first book I have read by Corben, but it certainly will not be the last!"
5,modern urban love story !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Riveted to the pages !!!!! Deepest love story. Lots of twists and surprises......but I knew who the villain was early on.
3,Kid stuff,"After reading about a chapter and a half of this book, I flipped to the inside cover about the author to see what awards he had captured. I had not heard of them before. I showed the first chapter to my 16 year old (a budding author) and proved that you don't have to be a great writer to get published! The idea and plot were ok and I read the book quickly (chapters stared 1/2 way down the page and a black page seperated each chapter) but my 16 year old could be the writer. His character and setting descriptions were so amateurish. Right from the beginning I noticed how poorly written this was."
4,A great story teller!,"Wow....I started reading this book and 24 hours later it was finished. I was fascinated by the whole tale. True love, murder, mystery, action packed.....I say good bye to Patterson and Hello to Coben. Harlan Coben can really write a good book."
3,"Fast and fun...but illogical, with a very bad ending.","I read this entertaining and suspenseful book in two hours because it's the very definition of a ""page-turner."" The pace is fast and the story is great...that is, until the end, when twist after twist piles up into a truly improbable, dumbly cinematic, slapped-on ending. It almost felt as if Harlan Coben died before the book was completed and a third-rate substitute writer was brought in to author the ending. I was quite disappointed that Coben didn't work harder to wrap things up in a more believable and interesting way.If this book had ended differently I would have given it maybe four and a half stars, because it's so incredibly engrossing at first."
2,"I MUST TELL SOMEONE (RE: ""TELL NO ONE"")","MR. COBEN CREATED A SLEEPER AND A PLOT THAT IS MUCH TOO CONFUSING. WHILE WE ALL LOVE HIS USUAL TWISTS AND TURNS, THIS ONE LEAD TO NOWHERE. I FELT AS THOUGH I WERE TRAPPED IN A LABARYNTH AND WOULD NEVER FIND MY WAY OUT.I MUST CONFESS, THIS BOOK BORED ME SO MUCH I CHOSE NOT TO SEE IT OUT TO THE END, AS IT FELT LIKE A CHORE TO READ IT, WHICH IS EXTREMELY UNUSUAL FOR ME.""TELL NO ONE"" DOES NOT EVEN COME CLOSE TO SOME OF HIS OTHER BOOKS.BETTER TO HAVE QUALIT THAN QUANTITY. MR.COBEN IS AN OUTSTANDING WRITER, BUT FELL SHORT WITH ""TELL NO ONE"". IT WAS ALSO TOO FAR FETCHED FOR MY TASTE.TRISHA ANNE"
4,stunning,"this is my third book of harlan coben-I read before The Final Detail and Gone for good. I think that Tell No One is the most appealing book to me. I love the beginning about the e-mails from distant computer, and all the issue about the computers (street cam and all this).after that the plot progress good and the book moving all the time. I cant identify with Back, the hero of the book- I think that Coben neglacted is caracters. He need to give them more depth, more personality. Despite this I love the caracter of Wa, a very strong men that practice his hands all day and have amazing power in his hands.I read other review and some review mention that the twists in the end is too much. Its not believable- too much complicated. for summary- I very like this book and now I start another book of Coben-one false move. I hope its good too!!!"
2,Just OK,"I don't get all the great reviews here. The book starts off very promisingly, but then quickly turns hokey. I was very disappointed. The best thing about the book is some of its rich characters, but the story just doesn't ring true and didn't work for me at all. A great concept, just badly realized."
5,Mystery,This is absolutely my favorite book by Harlan Coben. I absolutely loved it. It will keep you reading and you won't want to put this bad boy down
2,Didn't read the fine print,I was disappointed in this book because it is really to be used by parents for at home activities and not in the classroom. I should of read the fine print.
3,"Honest, but disappointing","I enjoy Mr. Tyler's monthly column in Prevention magazine and expected this book to be similar in scope and format. I was disappointed to find that it wasn't; much of it is written in medical terms but I can't imagine it being detailed enough for use by a physician or phamacist. I found the book I was looking for in ""The American Pharmaceutical Assocation's Practical Guide to Herbal Health"" (don't let the title scare you, it's straight-forward) by Andrea Piece. I do appreciate Mr Tyler honest assessments concerning the use of herbs; however, for me at least, this could also have been a much better book than it turned out to be. I will continuous to enjoy his magazine articles though."
4,Zoom creep a problem,"I bought this as my first upgrade lens for the Canon xti. As a new user, it is hard to tell if the OS actually works, because on or off it takes pictures with less blur than the standard 18-55mm lens that came with the camera.The zoom is very un-smooth in the amount of twising force required. I wanted to take picures of some birds in trees, but when pointing the camera upward, the zoom tends to automatically move from the 110 to the 35mm position. I read here there is a zoom lock, but it only locks in the 18mm position, and is useless for zoom creep."
3,Half the price but half the qaulity,"This is the second Sigma Lens I've owned and the second one I've returned. Common to many Sigma lenses is zoom creep, inaccurate focus, and heaviness. The reason I give it 3 stars?? If you use your DSLR more for snapshots and need a huge zoom range this lens is a good alternative to carrying two lenses or spending $600 on the Canon equivilant. If you want your pictures to be in focus and have a lighter lens, smoother focus ring and have some extra money in your budget, go with a Canon lens"
4,Very good lens,"I am not a specialist but I know when I see a good product. The only issue, not big, is the smoothness of the zoom ring. I am also using it for shooting video with my T2i and it works great."
2,Buyer beware,"I was so eager to get a multi range lens(sort of a everyday carry around)that would keep me from constantly changing lens between shots, but I quickly found out that this lens was not for me. The shots were very soft focused and often presented some vignetting and dark spots. Also the lens seemed to have a hard time finding it's focus. I just was not happy and did not want to be stuck with this lens. I simply did not think it was a good investment, so after three weeks, I decided to contact the seller for a refund. The seller was not at all happy about refunding my money. He sent me a ""not so pleasant"" email which I thought was totally unnecessary. I had to get Amazon involved to get my money back and of course I paid the cost of the return shipping. I will make sure I stay away from this particular seller and lens in the future."
5,Brilliant invention!,"What a lifesaver this ionic brush is. And my terrier loves to smell the fresh air that comes out of it, it calms her down. Plus she smells sweet after I use it all over her, what a blessing! It makes less frequent washing possible. And that means less soap irritation and scratching. I brush her slowly and gently with this, after using her normal hair brush to get out knots etc. I can't imagine why these other reviewers didn't like it. Did they forget to insert a battery?! Maybe they used it in the ""off"" position!PS, I got one for me too. Fab!"
2,Wrong color,"So even after reading the latest review, I decided to take a chance and order this item. I specifically chose it because I wanted it to be black or grey and I wanted the bed to have sides.It showed up and it was green and brown! I called the company and they told me that it was a ""listing error."" They'll fully refund me and I can keep or donate the bed. They have no way of knowing what color I'll get if they reorder. They also have no way of knowing if they have the grey/black one in stock!Crazy. So, good dealings with the company, but if you order this pet bed because you want the exact one listed, you're taking your chances!The bed itself seems ok. Worth what I paid or maybe less. We'll see if the kitties like it!"
5,Brain Bending,"I have a love hate relationship with this book. It is as difficult as any Chem, O-Chem or Physics text.It started with all hate...Passe I thought to myself. All this theory is so old school. So then. As this book moved into the Post Modernists I detached myself a bit and then started to get warm fuzzy feelings about the theory and how I was using it in my day to day life and how well all this verbosity and inference was going to and has served me well in my current classes. Months later I find myself digging through it and my class work to find some Foucault for references. With a mix of Anthropologists and many social scientists I think I might be inspired to take on a few units for a minor in Sociology.If you are using this as a school text. Do not doubt the importance of the introductory pages. I would repeat myself but I know if you have to read this book you are a bright soul.Good Luck with that theory class!;-)"
5,Thanks!,I love this lipstick for its moisturizing conditioner and the color lasts most of the night. The only problem was they discontinued it in most drug stores (what were they thinking????)
3,lipcolor,"Was not pleased with color. Hard to tell real color on screen. Oh well, I'll use them sometimes."
4,A superb kenjutsu book for those who are studying the Shinkage-Ryu sword system.,"As a former student of the Shendin Jinkinshin Kage Ryu sword system, I was familiar with most the basic cuts in this volume. However, this is not a book for a beginner. Indeed, as one of the reviewers correctly stated, ""You cannot learn Japanese swordsmanship, no matter what style, from merely reading a book."" This is a book for intermediate and advanced students. It is filled with clear photographs showing the techniques; nevertheless, you cannot learn these sword techniques without guidance from a competent kenjutsu instructor. Not all martial artists will find this book of value.In conclusion, if you are involved in kenjutsu, kendo, Iaido or other sword systems, you might find this book of interest.Rating: 4 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Samurai Aerobics: the Kenjutsu workout manual)."
2,Cute fridge but too noisy for an office,"I bought this fridge to store some cold sodas in my office. It works well enough and keeps the sodas cold. It also is an attention-getter due to its stylish design. However, for the life of me I can't get past the noise of the motor. I tried putting a box between me and the fridge, but in my office the sound reverberates off the walls. It's now sitting unplugged with some warm sodas inside. I'll probably end up giving it to someone who doesn't mind the noise."
5,"Guten, guten, guten","Well, this is German tech-house. What else can I say???Ohh,check out ""In Between"" by Martin Landsky, as well as, ... the very well kept secret of ""Groove Factory"". Enjoy!"
1,cumbias,"linda vera cd cumbias latinismo/dance is a rip off, not original songs from the 60's, don't know who singer isLatinismo Dance: Cumbias"
3,The voice and talent are there but...,"I have all Lucinda Williams' albums (I think) and this was the latest one I bought. And I must say I like much more her own material than these cover versions. Lucinda has obvious talent and a personal voice but the songs on this album are not so special. There are pearls among the material but anyway this is flat compared to her other work.So if you have not listened to Lucinda before start with albums ""West"" or ""Car Wheels on Gravel Road"". Those are some stars better than this one.On the other hand if you like the actual songs on this album I am sure you'll like also Lucinda's way to perform those."
3,Work in progress,"Don't get me wrong--I love Williams' music and this is not a bad album, but it definitely doesn't sound as though she had grown into her musical self yet. The music is fine technically but she sounds as though she's trying it on and hasn't found the right fit. ""A"" for effort and a learning experience, though."
1,How Boring,"Lucinda Williams' voice is that of a harmony singer. She does that well on Terry Allen's CD's. Her own CDs are boring and monotonous. Who knows if her song writing is any good because her singing is so boring, just like Sheryl Crow. I guess if you like Sheryl, you'll like Lucinda. There you go. Try Gillian Welch. She's got a song and a voice. Listen to what you like."
5,"Pure, distilled Lucinda.","This is a truly excellent album. An early Williams album, it was recorded for Folkways Records, who specialized in folk, jazz and the blues. The clean, simple guitar accompanyment accentuates Lucinda's voice and the songs she sings. She has chosen a collection of songs that includes blues, country and traditional and performs them all well. The blues covers are especially good.This is a keeper."
1,Pointless and boring,"Once again, the same old juvenile humor. BORING! Maybe when he grows up, he'll have something worth listening to. Until then, avoid this like the plague."
2,Pretty Average,this film reminded of alot of other movies from the 90's onward.Heavy on Language to override a thin plot&any reasoning why things are blowing up&seeming overacted&scripted.Gene Hackman is a Great Actor but aside from Delroy Lindo(a Very Underrated Actor I might add)the rest of the acting are just standing there knowing this film is finished&figured out right after the Airport take over.very average at best.
1,What a waste!,"I was really looking forward to this movie - how could I resist a movie with Danny DeVito, Gene Hackman AND Delroy Lindo! Granted, I had been burned by Mamet before (I thought The Spanish Prisoner was obvious and unoriginal), but with his gift for dialouge, and some of the best actors in the business, how could it fail? Well, a battleship with all of the plot holes in this film would sink instantly! The characters are poorly developed, and do things that make no sense at all. The scene on the pier in Boston was so implausible it was laughable, and the ending made no sense whatsoever. If you want to see a good movie of this type, see Mamet's House of Games, but avoid Heist."
3,True to form,"What's to like about a David Mamet film? It's his style. The characterizations are ambiguous, the plot is tied into knots, and the dialogue is dealt like a deck of cards. The Heist is no exception--Mamet sticks to the basics. The fun of watching this movie is seeing the plot unfold, keeping count of the double-crossings and hearing some rather unlikely dialogue.I felt like The Heist continued the Mamet tradition, but stretched the limits of plot turns and unlikely dialogue. Just listen to the response when someone asks how long Gene Hackman's character has been with his wife. I won't even try to quote it here. After the fourth or fifth plot turn, I started wondering about the depth of some of these characters.The Spanish Prisoner continues to be the Mamet film I hold with the highest regard. Like The Spanish Prisoner and House of Games, The Heist continues the tradition of Mamet's unique style that makes his films so unique and enjoyable."
3,"Enjoyable, though not the best of David Mamet's films","Gifted writer/director David Mamet is back with his latest crime caper. His movies center around out-of-fashion elements like great dialog, characters with depth, and plots with more twists than a pretzel.Gene Hackman plays Joe, a rich, retired criminal, who is lured back into the life for one more heist by Bergman [Danny DeVito]. There's a gold shipment that's theirs for the taking. Complications include Joe's wife [Rebecca Pigeon], Bergman's trigger happy nephew [Sam Rockwell], doublecrosses, and a bit of magic.""Heist"" is a minor work by Mamet's standards, but any crime thriller by him towers above almost all the others around today.Better films by the director include 'House of Games"" and ""The Spanish Priosner""."
2,Superfluous Plot,"The movie starts off interesting. The story developes with satisfying complexity and mystery.However, as it gets towards the end, there are too many ""gatcha""s and ""surprise!""s and ""not so easy""s and ""fooled you!""s that it gets too unrealistic, it wasn't even cool anymore. The characters didn't convey enough emotions to make it convincing either. We ended up walking out of theater saying, ""Yeah, right.""Too bad because like I said, the first half of the movie was pretty good."
3,Are we that dumb?,"I thought the tone of this book was really patronizing (okay yeah I know it's for 'dummies' but does it need to keep reminding you of that fact constantly?). It's repetitive and ultimately tells you to consult an estate planner anyway--so forget using it to save money to plan your own estate. For a much more directly useful guide to estate planning (with forms you can fill out on a cd-rom), I highly recommend Quicken's Willmaker Plus. You get all the same information as in this book, plus more, and in a much less annoying style. And since it includes the forms for the key documents you need to prepare (e.g., simple will, durable power of attorney, etc.), you may be able to plan your own estate yourself (dummy or not)."
1,Not of value to me...,"I purchased the Willmaker Plus CD. The accompanying manual looked a bit thin so I ordered Estate Planning for Dummies to read before getting down to the Willmaker manual and program. Frankly, it was a waste of time and money, as the Willmaker manual and the on-screen help was more concise and better written. I've been happy with several Dummies books, but this isn't one of them."
3,Its okay but I wanted more-specific information,"This book gives you general information about Estate Planning but It left me wanting more. I was surprise that it didnt mention anything about AB trust. I wish it would have given the upside and donwnside to each options of wills or trust.I would have settled for a checklist what to ask your lawyer or accountant considering that he kept harping of always ask your lawyer. Although I see the lawyer point, if I was meeting with a lawyer I would have not wasted 20 dollars and change to read the book.Many who read books like Dummies want to avoid paying thousands of dollars to a lawyer or as I mention , and if you want me to ask my lawyer at least give me very specific checklist of questions.If you could, buy it at a discount or borrow it from the library. I probably sell mine on Ebay."
4,Great first alarm clock for kids,"This clock is very easy for my 7 year-old to use. He is able to set the alarm time, and hit 'snooze' if he needs to. It has been knocked off the bedside table about 6 times, and it still works! It's steady and is not top-heavy, so it stays put (unless he's playing with it). The price can't be beat, and as always, I'm pleased with an item made by Little Tikes."
5,Outstanding author,Mr. Edmonds is an excellent writer specializing in early New York State and colonial history. I discovered his writing about a year ago. To read his books is to read writing as excellent today as it was when it was new. His historical details are fascinating. I don't see authentic details like his in today's novels.
5,Instant Hoedown Fun,"The DVDs arrived quickly with great audio and sharp video. Great learning tool, no square dance experience is necessary. Very easy to use and understand. The colorful outfits make it simple to follow each couple in the demonstrations and the explanations of the calls are clear. Lots of fun for family and friends to have a great time at a reunion or birthday party, while getting exercise."
1,it sucked,i thought this cd sucked. she has no musical talent what so ever and i don't understand why anyone would listen to this crap when there are so many better muscians out there. I think the only people who like this cd are their friends or there moms and dads. but thats just my opinion.
4,funny stuff,"this was a good DVD at an even better price, I bought it as an x-mas preasent for my brother, of course it was on special or something for like 10$"
2,It did work -but,"Never installed one of these before but for the price, I gave it a shot before spending $60 Bucks at LMC. Also I did not see any other choices out their. The problems I ran into was the wires were to short, by the time you lace them threw the bottom plate the unit will not bolt up and sit flush, let alone make the 90 deg bend to run down the column. Then the outer top contact whiskers are too long, had to cut them off by 1/8"" each. Then the retains clip is paper thin, this indicator lever stud clip became a nightmare, I ended up drilling / tapping out the stud to metric .05 and used a threaded set screw, which is commonly found in many junk electronics. All 4 whiskers required bending to make contact and the lug rivets did hold up but I was holding my breath. When the dust settled, it did work but took two days. There are large alligators in the swamp and this is one of them."
4,Seems to work OK,"I've used the brush only a few times. When turned on, one can smell the ionized air. I question that this alone will keep a dog clean. But, my dog likes being brushed. I will still give her a bath as required. I may change my opinions as time passes."
4,Solid ska and rocksteady,A solid album of traditional ska and rocksteady.However this album does not include a few of their better tracks.
3,remix/remodel,"Though this new remix of My Generation for the most part sounds pretty awesome, I still feel a little ripped off. I was really hoping to buy the definitive version of this record, but the missing overdubs make me feel like I'm listening to a weird alternate version of the whole record. Even if your unfamiliar with the original version, the egregious flub in ""La-la-la-Lies"" still mars your listening experience. Here's an idea for MCA: You guys like money, right? How about reissuing the normal 1 CD mono version of My Generation but with better mastering. Then all of us Who fanatics who bought the 2 CD version will buy that too!"
5,Go Yugi!! ^^,"This is actually Yugi when he's merged with the spirit of his Millennium Puzzle, and not Yugi by himself ^_~ I do wish I could move his legs so he'd be more posable, but that's okay ^^ I'm just way happy that Mattel is releasing all this great Yugioh stuff! ^^ If you're a Yugioh fan, these way kewl figures are must-haves!!!"
4,Optical Mask,This is the second one I bought. My son was using mine and fits him too. The best thing is it is for a range of prescriptions so it doesn't matter if my prescription changed. It fits good and see clearly. Great product!
4,Best pods yet,"I've tried quite a few different pods, and this pod, Black Mountain Gold Gourmet, Costa Rican, is far and above the best. Smooth with a nice flavor- - no acidic after taste. Will definitely reorder.Received really quickly and packaging was excellent too."
4,"Good Product, Bad Bottle!","The product seems to work pretty well. I have applied it to my mailbox, A/C outdoor unit, and several other tools. The only issue I have is the trigger bottle and how it cannot be used to ""mist"" the contents in any way. It has the same stream, no matter what the setting is. In hindsight I should have bought the aerosol can for best application. I will have to buy a spray bottle with a good difuser attached, so as not to waste any of this precious substance! It does appear to be making a difference to the rust on everything I have applied it to. Hope this info helps someone. Thanks!"
3,Good,"Flatware is attractive for the price. However, the knives are quite long in comparison to other flatware I have owned. The edge is very sharp so it would not be good for young children. Two of the forks have slightly bent prongs which is a quality control issue for the manufacturer. For this reason, it is not the effort to send the 12 place settings and serving pieces back for an exchange as I am not certain the problem might not still exist. Claire"
1,"No, no, no...","This is difficult, because I am reviewing as a parent and not a child and my review is mostly based on the Amazon price, not entirely on the movie. My 7 year old daughter watched this, and thought it was fine - as far as I can tell she liked it. The one star rating is for the $2.99 price for a 23 minute ""movie."" I think the entire thing was shot in a day - at one location - and just low, low production quality. Again, for kids it's fine, but I think it should be priced appropriately for what it is.If it was $.99 or less, then my rating might be 3 stars. My daughter would probably give it 4 stars - after all... the Olsen twins are pretty cute little girls, even if their acting at that time is not the best, still cute to watch for little kids."
2,Uneven Quality Control,"Like the other reviewer I am having problems with some of the containers not sealing correctly. In my case, 2 of the 4 containers will not hold a vacuum. The leak appears to come from inside the pumping mechanism. I do like the basic design but the quality control seems poor."
2,One of the better books in a not very good series,"This is actually one of the better books in this series, which is not very good. This book had a bit of a darker feel to it, and thus felt more like Star Wars than the other books in the series. However, this book may have been somewhat entertaining, but that can not take away the fact that the writing is cheesy, the characters undeveloped and not like themselves, most especially Luke, and the intire plot is somewhat silly. Kids too young or to lazy to read Young Jedi Knights, or Heir to the Empire, but would still like to see the Star Wars story continued would probably like this series. Fans older than twelve would probably get more enjoyment out of just about anything else."
4,Highly recommended!,"This novel begins with a woman helping her elderly neighbor move into a retirement home. The elderly lady keeps giving her heirlooms to the woman, knowing the woman is a collector of antiques and an armchair historian. One of the things she passes along is her grandmother's diary -- a journal kept when the grandmother, Mattie, travelled West with her husband to set up a homestead in the Colorado Territory. The rest of the novel is the diary itself -- a marvelous story that made me think constantly of the ""Little House"" books. I really enjoyed this novel a lot and look forward to reading Dallas's other books. Highly recommended to anyone who misses the Ingalls or loves stories about strong women pioneers."
4,A great book!,"What a hard and frightening time Mattie had! How did those women survive? This is a very good, very believable story. Hard to put down."
5,Thought provoking and heart stealing,"I got this book from my local library after reading Alice's Tulips. Being a quilter, I am familiar with Dallas' love of quilts and history. I found this book very well written. A masterpiece of historical fiction. I was gripped and found it difficult to put the book down. I really enjoyed the format, it helped to anchor the book and draw you into Mattie's world. Definitely has its heart wrenching moments, so have a box of tissues near by. At first I was disappointed with the ending but upon reflection of the book I realize that it has the perfect ending. Maybe not what you would be hoping for but it follows the tone of the book regarding women's hardships and the tough selfless decisions women have to make, a suitable and understandable conclusion to a wonderfully written novel. I have decided to add this book to my library as I truly enjoyed reading it and would like to read it again."
5,A story with staying power.,It has been five years since I picked up this book in the library on a whim and the story has stayed with me ever since - so much so that I finally decided to look it up here and see what others had to say. It's certainly not great literature but there is something about Dallas's straight forward manner and story presentation that is compelling and very believable. I'm amazed that I can still remember most of the book. Mattie's attempt to make a go of life in the wilderness and all the obstacles - both emotional and physical - that she encounters are page turners. A few years later I discovered an even better book along the same lines: Angle of Repose by Wallace Stegner.
5,Great Book,"This book truly paints the picture and gives the feel of what it was like for the women who moved to Colorado to homestead. As it is written in Diary form, it can be read for just a few minutes each day. I read it to one of my Hospice patients who was unable to communicate. The diary entries gave natural breaks for 30 minutes of reading. When she passed away, we had not completed the book, so I bought it so I could finish it. The end of the book was filled with surprise and left me amazed over Mattie's courage and strength. Amazing Book!!"
5,One of my favorites this year!,"An eloquent and exciting diary of life in the Colorado gold country. Just when you think it will be another ho-hum account of struggle and strife, the author throws in a surprise ending with shocking scandal. Love this author!"
1,What a waste!!,"It should be no shock that this toy was short-lived in stores. I think Little Tikes knew they had a lemon and removed it as soon as possible -- or as soon at the holiday rush ended & they had made their money. It is horrible!! As other reviewers have stated, the sound quality is terrible. Little Tikes should be ashamed of themselves for putting such a poor quality item on store shelves. This toy is junk. I wouldn't even pay 50 cents for it at a yard sale.Follow up/review addendum: As unhappy as I was with this product, I do have to say that Kids Station came thru in terms of customer service. A manager called me back, and kindly offered me a full refund for the product, and sent me a new set of phones! I still give the product itself 1 star, but I have to give Kids Station 5 stars for demonstrating the true meaning of customer service."
2,NOT LITTLE TIKES,Great idea but...The battery connection for these are wrong so the batteries dont fit correctly which means the phone doesnt work right. I contacted Little Tikes and they do NOT manufacture this product. It is made by Kids Station for Little Tikes so they told me to contact them. I contacted the company and they said they'd send me a new set. Hopefully this time it works!
1,Raves must be by fellow stoners ...zzzz,"I found this tedious in the extreme. I don't understand all the 4 star reviews. The main character, a struggling med student, spends the entire movie with one befuddled expression on his face, like he is astonished and shocked by every single thing and person and comment he encounters all day every day and night. I wanted to slap him. That was not realistic. The rest of the stoners here were simply boring. ZZZzzzzz..."
4,Great independent movie,"Being a long-time Humboldt County resident, I have been to every identifiable scene in this movie. I was expecting a bad movie, but they really pulled this off nicely. Great cinematography, excellent acting, and a great sound track that blended right in with the rest of the movie. (But Fairuza Balk's jazz act really stood out for me.)My only complaint was that I could not hear some of the lines toward the beginning. Whisper-level lines are a no no. But it seemed that the sound crew did a better job as the movie progressed.Highly recommended, and a must-see for locals or those with an interest in the back-to-the-land lifestyle."
1,The Fornication Lobby,"Athough the author has scholarly credentials, this is not a scholarly work. It is an exercise in rage---rage that the Church still proclaims the value of chastity in the midst of the bourgeoisie's ongoing sexual revolution.The author sees signs of homosexuality everywhere in Catholicism. Incense, Marian devotions, vestments---they all show occult signs of homosexuality. The signs, of course, are so occult that most us can't see it. I never realized what an erotic thirll chasubles secretly are.The poor author can't quite figure out where his rant will go---although he's certain that John Paul II is the enemy. On the one hand, he yells about the alleged predominance of homosexuals in the clergy and in the seminaries. But that sounds too homophobic. So he then rants that the Church isn't homosexual enough. It's too straight, too pro-family, too traditional.Poor scholarship, another sad screed from the anti-Catholic Catholic."
1,The body of thought presented in this book is not new...,"only the rhetorical dressing is spruced up a bit. I would recommend, as far better book choices on this topic, two other books offered at Amazon: HOMSEXUALITY AND THE POLITICS OF TRUTH, by Dr. Jeffrey Satinover; HOMOSEXUALITY AND AMERICAN PUBLIC LIFE, ed. by Dr. Christopher Wolfe."
2,Doesn't work well on small jars,I purchased the small mouth jar sealer. I couldn't get it to seal the jar once I vacumed down the jar. Upon removal of jar sealer it pulled off the mason jar lid every time. The large one did not have any problems at all. The small one is just too tight on the lid and the seal too tight. I do not recammend this product.
4,Jar sealer works good.,Jar sealer seals great but I have to put the blue gasket back on each time I seal.It could just be me not being able to get it straight off top because it has sealedso good.
5,Great,I love my food saver. I use these on jars to store my dehydrated goods. I have both sizes and they work great.
1,No hose,"One star because I can't use it. It doesn't come with a hose, and I can't find a hose to purchase."
4,Great Recomended Product,Product works great some some lids it may take a try or two as the lids come off when you take this product off the Mason jar. Great product to preserve and store your dry good items.
1,Couldn't make this work.,Didn't work even after using 2 different food savers and after several tries. I should have returned them but did not do so in time.
2,Doesn't Work,"Wish it did, but all attempts failed. According to the ratings, I am not the only person.Why a wide mouth sealer works, and a regular-mouth sealer doesn't?"
5,Food saver jar sealer,Love these! Work great and have held up well. I have both sizes and they really vacuum nice and tight. Would buy again!
1,Regular Mouth Jar Sealer does not work- wide moutn is better,"I started with the wide mouth Ball pint jars and had few problems. However, when I got the regular mouth jar sealer and tried it on Quart Ball jars it was a failure. I tried all the suggestions and it still failed every time. I've given up on it and will purchase wide mouth Ball Quart jars and lids and see if they will work. When you look at the cost of Foodsaver plastic bag materials, another dozen Ball jars looks like a good investment."
4,PlayBall DVD set,"VERY NICE set of DVDs about Pitching, Hitting and Fielding. Basic; butstill valuable information.Perfect for Little League Coaches/Managers.Randy from Oceanside, CA"
5,Great Intro for Kids!,These give great step by step instruction for beginners. Great with basics and a good start...
1,"Am I the only one who thinks he sounds like Richard Gere in ""Chicago""?","Man, am I glad I previewed the material before pluncking down the moolah to buy music I would've downloaded then dumped.C'mon. That's the single-most nasaly, grating voice I've heard coming from jazz n' standards singer.Heck, even Harry Connick, Jr. is better (and I'm no Connick fan)."
3,Let Me Put It This Way....,"Matt Dusk is an average singer. He is neither awful nor excellent. My three stars are for the arrangements. Once I arrived at track #6, ""As Time Goes By"", and heard him pronounce fundamental... ""funna-mennal"", itwas enough for me. When big bucks are spent on a producer, arrangements, fine musicians, classy graphics, etc., why would that producer (and the record company) be satisfied with a vocalist who performs a great americansongbook classic, and doesn't know how to pronounce part of the lyric content? I mean shouldn't that be a fundamental consideration in a project like this? It's called attention to detail."
3,NOT as GOOD as ALLENDE,"I enjoyed this book very much. I love the Latin American style of writing, and this was the first novel I had read by a Puerto Rican. I thought it was a fine novel, but not such a memorable one. ""Eva Luna"", ""House of the Spirits"", ""The Infinite Plan"" and others by Isabel Allende have resurfaced in my mind from time to time ever since I read them. I think every reader experiences some discomfort after reading a truly superior writer and then finding that other writers are bland in comparison. ""The House on the Lagoon"" is a good book, but it is not on the same level as Allende or Gabriel Garcia Marquez... I think that readers expecting storytelling and magical realism akin to Allende and Marquez will be disappointed."
3,I was disappointed,"I am always on the look-out for hispanic female authors, so when I saw Rosario Ferre's books, I looked forward to enjoying them. But Ms. Ferre's writing is always just a little too convoluted, the stories too complicated, too involved. This book is a book within a book. The title character is trying to be an author, and her husband, also an author, takes apart her book, which she is hiding and he is finding. She knows he reads it and looks for his notes in her margins. He hates the book. She's angry with him.Toward the end of the book, I got so confused regarding just what was happening to whom - was it Ferre's character, or her character's character? I actually went looking for the original Spanish to try and figure it out.Too much work."
5,Perfect Size,These bags are the perfect size for meats for the 2 of us. Have had no problems with not sealing. Just let it coolfor a few seconds after the sealing light goes out. Love them!
1,Do NOT Seal!!!,"I too was excited to see this size. A waste of money! they do NOT seal! Actually glad to hear that others have the same problem, I thought it was just me!"
5,decent size,Good to order for people just starting to use the food saver. Afterawhile it is more economical to buy thr rolls and make the size bags you need.
3,Worth a read,"This is a decent but not spectacular book, which is written as a series of 46 five to ten page articles on various programming topics, such as ""Orthogonality"", ""Design by Contract"" and ""The Requirements Pit"". The segments are quite heavily cross-referenced (which I didn't find very useful).The authors dole out a lot of solid advice, which is the book's strength. I found myself disagreeing with very little. There are memorable tips and some good stories. The writing style is also very accessible and conducive to diving in at any page.The book seems a bit lightweight. The exercises are a little simple and I don't think you'll find yourself going back to this book a lot. Also, the typeface is annoyingly large.I'd recommend this to someone who has done some programming and understands the syntax and fundamentals but hasn't gotten into programming larger pieces of software. I think that if you have programmed anything significant you won't find much new in here."
4,Great Book for Beginners to Intermediate Programmers,"There is a lot of good information in this book. But, if you have been programming for about 5 or more years, you probably already know about 80-90% of the material covered."
5,A must read for every programmer,"This book, as its subtitle states, is for all programmers ""from journeyman to master""."
5,Better than Dr. Suess - Oh the Places You'll Go!,"This book is wisely written and will captivate readers of all ages. There is a greater meaning behind each rhyming verse than children will understand and that adults will appreciate. It is a great ""pick me up"" book that comes highly suggested!"
5,This is one of my favorite cookbooks,"I go to this cookbook all the time. My favorite is the Okra-Rice Gumbo. I have personalized it a bit by adding garlic, thyme and oregano to the existing recipe."
5,Healthy and delicious soups,"I usually make 1 soup recipe each week. I have several soup recipe books, but this is the one I use exclusively. I have enjoyed every soup recipe so far. It is also nice to know that the meals are healthy. I highly recommend this book."
1,An abomination,"Sorry to disagree with the other reviewers, but this is the worst cookbook I have ever bought. I am a skilled and experienced vegetarian cook, and recipes in this book are perversely, malignantly vile. There will always be recipes we don't like in any cookbook, but I tried half a dozen soups in this book and they were just wretched. After the last one I just threw the book in the recycling bin. Back to Moosewood!"
1,Can't hear,"I cannot hear anyone on this phone, even with the ""voice enhancer"" feature. If I answer with this phone, I always search out another phone in the house to talk on."
1,No Headset Jack,I purchased this item through amazon partner circuitcity.The extended techinical information about this phone is incorrect. There is no Headset jack. I wish I had gone to panasonic official site to confirm this. For me no headset jack means this phone is less then useless. I find it very strange that a phone of this price does not have headset jack. Needless to say I will be returning this phone soon as possible.
4,Very good for the price,"I bought this TV for my RV because it has a built in DVD player. Now I also use it in our exercise room when it is not in our RV.I tried the computer input and was amazed at how good it is as a monitor. If I needed a monitor I think I would buy this TV instead. Maybe it won't work with a Direct TV remote, but who cares anyway?It has a good variety of inputs.I paid about 225.00 or so on sale. So far a nice little TV!"
5,cal newport is the best! But never purchase from this seller!,"I love all books and blogs by Cal Newport! I highly recommend his material. However, My order have not been shipped and I ordered 2 weeks ago. So please choose the seller wisely!"
4,"Reasonable, revealing advice","**UPDATED --- now 5 starsCal Newport's passion for the subject is transparent. Writing as an experienced, well-researched ""big brother,"" Newport avoids being didactic while imparting advice he clearly believes in.The advice is, quite simply, great. From the attitude to the study techniques, Newport covers a good majority of what a college student needs to accomplish in order to win as per his interpretation. For any freshman or sophomore looking to become one of those all-around stars on campus -- for anyone ambitious -- I highly recommend this book.Some of the advice is, at first, overwhelming. However, it is all very, very true and tested. As Cal would say about any assignment, let it simmer in the background of your mind for a while. You will realize how prescient his advice is.Thanks Mr. Newport for the great advice!"
5,Pick it up!,"Any student intimidated by the increased demands of the college curriculum should immediately read this book. The material is well-organized, focused, and always practical in its approach. In addition, many of the book's recommendations are equally relevent to developing a successful approach to life and career in the ""real world"" after college. Highly recommended for students and non-students alike!"
2,Not as good as his other book,"Definitely get his other book first.This one has lots of good advice, but most of it is obvious; less procrastination, more self care (including the much neglected emotional health), challenging extracurricular activities, balancing priorities, etc... Unfortunately, I am a non-traditional student in my senior year so half of this stuff doesn't apply. Some of it is downright weird or just not important; for example, I don't think my college success has a lot to do with what newspaper I read.Basically, get his other book, on study skills. The best of this stuff is in his other book."
4,A Handy Resource Guide!,"I purchased this book because I am interested in starting my own business. It has proven to be a great resource guide. The topics are easy to read and comprehend. In some cases, the discussions are very short and precise. I would recommend for others. However, it is a much better resource guide than a day to day planning guide."
2,Stopped working,It worked good for about a week then the chime started going off on its own once in a while. It then became more frequently until we finally pulled the battery and said forget it. Should have returned it but we didn't.
2,Pet Paw for Pet Chime,"Great concept, easy to train my dogs (poms) to use & they seem to love triggering the bell, but disappointed with the quality. I had purchased 3 about a year ago and they worked for few months then the switches started getting sticky.. I thought I would order a couple more as it keeps my dogs from scratching the doors.. and they immediately did not work right. They either erroneously just start triggering the bell or don't at all when pressed. I tried to contact Lentek and they just told me I could return to Amazon within 30 days of purchase.. They don't seem to want to guarantee their product. I took apart one of my old ones to try to fix and the problem seems to be with the switch inside. It sometimes activates it sometimes does not.. and sometimes sticks on. I wish someone would make one that would work for a while. I would pay more for one that actually functioned."
5,Great movie,Won't give away the plot but was a great movie we'd seen many times and wanted our own copy. If you haven't seen it you're in for an enjoyable evening.
5,Greatest Story Ever Told,Diggstown represents a mans struggle against the forces of the collective which is diggstown aka communism. Honey Roy Palmer is a boxer who dosent know how to give up even when it looks like he is destined to lose... but he dosent aka democracy. This film with its subtle humor represents a powerful message that should be studied by government students and professors like I am.
5,Great,Works exactly what i need it for. great speed and build quality. Use it to connect to an ethernet switch and the speed is great.
3,Delicates bag that's okay,"It's a bit too large for bras (they still get tangled) but for dresses or other washables it fits the bill. I haven't had it open unlike other products but I've only used it a few times. We'll see later how well it works. For now though, it's good."
4,"great for baby socks, loveys, etc.","I use this to prevent our dog from eating our baby's socks. I also use it for washing our baby's loveys and stuffed animals. The bags are rougher than another lingerie bag I have. Overall, this is a good value."
4,Very Good,I've used this twice since I purchased it and it has made doing laundry a bit easier. I put all my sox or anything that get easily tangle with other clothes. It also withstand dryer heat. Good product.
2,Not HD,Native resolution of this display does not reach HD so that means that any source you think is 720p actually is downscaled to 480p. If EDTV is what you want then this might be a good buy but don't buy it thinking you're getting HDTV.
4,really neat little fan with negative ion feature,"This is a nice little fan with an option to create negative ions as the fan blows. I'm not sure if the negative ions are doing anything, or if it's really producing them, but the fan is very quiet. Maybe running it in a confined space would make the effects of the negative ions apparent.All in all, the small size and very quiet motor make it a pretty nice purchase even without the negative ions. Cats love it - I don't know what that's about, but my cats sit and sleep in front of it -- maybe they perceive the negative ions when I can't?"
1,DVD does not work on my Blue Ray Player,"Beware, this DVD will not work on Blue Ray Players!!!!!!! Human Nature DVD from Australia. ""Reach Out, Live at the Capital"""
1,DVD is wrong format for USA,"I am returning DVD. This DVD is produced in Australia and arrived in PAL format, not capable of playing in USA format of NTSC. PAL is popular in Europe, Asia, and Australia. Japan, Canada, and USA only use NTSC. BEWARE - It will not work in USA DVD players!"
2,ugh..I was skipping pages and skimming pages to finish it faster,"After reading and LOVING the first book, I am sad to say that Forever Odd was such a disappointment. I couldn't finish the book fast enough. The plot was lame..it was like Koontz couldn't think up a way for the best friend to get kidnapped. I swear the journey to the Casino took FOREVER! I miss stormy but I understand that she is no longer with us. I think a lot of it was the very apparent absence of the rest of the cast. I love the Chief, Ozzie and even Elvis. This book just didn't do it for me at all. I'm not sure if I'll keep going with this series or not."
5,Odd is my new best friend! too bad he's to young for me!,"After reading Dean's ""Trixie Memoir"" I had to go back and re-read all the ""Odd"" books. After knowing what message the author was trying to get across - the books read differently for me! don't know what I'm going to do after I finish Odd Apocolypse!!"
2,Loved Odd's debut but this is a poor follow-up,"ODD THOMAS was such a great character/book that I rank it with John Irving's A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY and Koontz's own WATCHERS.But this follow-up is HEAVILY PADDED and really not very interesting or compelling. Pages and chapters are filled with Odd on his journey, climbing down into sewers, up and down elevators, etc.It reminded me of Koontz's MIDNIGHT when the entire novel was a chase. Odd Thomas is a wonderful character and I think the book in which he made his debut may become a classic because it had so much going for it and a true ""whallop!"" of an ending.This follow-up is a pale immitation."
4,Liked it,"At one time, about a year ago, I tried to read ODD THOMAS and couldn't force myself past the first chapter. What compelled me to give the sequel a shot- I don't know, but I'm glad I did. This is a fun, humble, and exciting book. I really like the main carachter, Odd Thomas. Now, I've read some reviews on here where people trash this book. While they might have found faults in it, I think overall its worth whatever $7 or so price you're going to pay. People who write these 20 paragraph rebukes of this book.... well, I think it's a bit overboard. This book is by far no stinker. I read a lot of books (mainstream, literary, poetry, etc) and I really enjoyed this and will read the third book (Though I'm still skeptical about the first)."
2,Comic Book Koontz,Not one of my favorites. No character depth. Villian was completely unbelievable and one dimensional. Same old story hauled out and retread one more time. Koontz also needs to leave the Thesaurus in the drawer. Not one of Koontz' better works. When will he return to the greateness of PHANTOMS or STRANGERS?
4,Good book!,It was decent. It was something along the lines of Stephen King but a little different. I bought the next novel in line so here's to looking for more hours of reading pleasure.
3,My least favorite of the trilogy,"Some of the descriptions and characters were too gross -- and I'm no pansy. Nevertheless, the story was interesting and suspenseful."
1,"Odd needs a rest, a long, long rest","One of the typical defining characteristics of a Dean Koontz novel is how ordinary people may exhibit extraordinary courage and faith in difficult circumstances. ""Grace under fire"" might well be placed on Mr. Koontz' personal coat of arms. A parallel theme is that, even when things are really, really bad, life is worth struggling for. Repeatedly, I have thrilled to read how the demons are at the door, death and worse seems imminent, and yet good hearted men and women ""keep fighting"" and find love in the battle.Here, our rather unusual hero from the first novel ""solves"" the murder case but ends up concluding that life is not worth the pain involved. Read this novel with abundant anti-depressants at hand. Please, Mr. Koontz, Odd Thomas needs a long, and perhaps, permanent, rest."
5,Great Book,Loved this book. Great pacing throughout the story and kept me interested throughout. I have always been a fan of Dean Koontz and he does not dissappoint with this novel.
1,"Too much description, too little action","It is nice when the location and feeling of a place are conveyed. But if you all that out, the story would be about 30 pages long. There is not sufficient action for a book this long. It looks like Mr. Koontz is banking on his name more than his storytelling."
5,Fan of Odd,"I really enjoyed this book! The whole plot basically took place in one area, the old decrepit casino, and it was always mysterious. It's my first Odd book and I can definitely say I'll be reading more of the series. I like the way Odd thinks and what he encounters. The other characters throughout were very interesting and at times pretty freaky. A lot of tunnels and underground scenes that made me feel like I was there! Dean has always been one of my favorites, can't wait to read more Odd Thomas books."
2,What happened???,"I'm not sure what happened to Dean Koontz' point of view in this novel. Sssooooooooo boring when compared to Odd Thomas. I kept waiting for this book to pick up some steam and become interesting. WHY would you want to read about people being trapped in the same tunnels and casino for 400 pages? OMG, give me my money back, Mr. Koontz. Where were all the ghosts and bodachs this time around? The ""mushroomy"" guy in the first book made my skin crawl; too bad I couldn't even get a shiver out of this book. Bad, bad, bad. Hopefully Mr. Koontz will redeem himself in the third of this series."
3,"A disapoint from high hopes from the great ""Odd Thomas""","First off, I loved the first book. I never put it down, read it cover to cover in one day. ""Forever Odd"" just isn't as compelling and emotionally involving as it's original. Sure, it still has Elvis and the witty banter but it doesn't connect with the audience the same. The whole situation and events seem a little too far fetched, even in the world of ""Odd Thomas"". A close childhood friend goes missing, that's all I'll say about the story. Where was this friend in the first book? No refrence to him/her and many other details just don't quite cut it for me. How the story transpires is just amusing. I love Dean Koontz but he mailed in some of the story, as much as it pains me to say it.Bottom line: If you read the first book and loved as I had, this sequel is a decent read, just don't give your hopes up. If you haven't read the first one you should be slapped in the face. It is one of Koontz's finest!"
2,Disappointing,"I love koontz. Loved Odd Thomas, the Husband...most of his other work. That's why I was so surprised (not in a good way) by this book. I agree with the reviewer Terry B on most aspects. If this had been a book shopped around by an unknown author, it never would've made the cut. Laughable villains, rambling story that never seemed to get to the point...I'm almost afraid to read Brother Odd at this point."
3,I was not impressed.,"I did ballet for the last 4 years before coming to college. I missed ballet and was looking for something that would help me keep up with it- and give me a workout as ballet does, from the comfort of my own room. I feel like this was made for those without any or much ballet experience. But at the same time, the way it is shot/edited at times makes it hard to follow. When a step is being demonstrated suddenly it goes to a black and white zoom on the instructor's upper body, when what you need to see is her feet! Furthermore I'm disappointed with the non-ballet muscle toning parts. It's nothing special, crunches and push up, which when I'm buying an excersive video I don't want the abdominal excersizes to be all crunches- I could come up with that on my own.It's not awful, ther are things I like, but overall it's not as good as I was expecting."
5,Puma Shoes Black & White,"I've bought these shoes three times in a row, I always get the black ones. The design is good and look very sporty. They are very low shoes. These are NOT running shoes and they are shoes you don't want to walk in for more than six hours. The bottom of the shoes are thinner than converse chucks shoes. You can't fit any inserts into these shoes. These shoes are not recommended if you have flat feet. If you walk on rocky surfaces you WILL feel them. These shoes are more for hanging out. They are very durable. The fabric has a velvet finish and some parts eventually fade to a light black color but that doesn't happen right away, they are very breathable. I might get another pair and they are worth it."
5,A Great Brand New Adventure,"As a fan of the Akiko comics and the past four books I can't express how happy I am to have another adventure, and best of all it's totally barnd new! Plus, it's a lot of fun, even if Middleton isn't. (If I was Akiko I'd just stay on Smoo!)"
3,Yes it's a toilet.,"Well, once you mastered the art of getting the water bottle into the funnel without spilling it, the next obstacle is getting the funnel attached to the body. The key is attaching the bottle to the funnel while the bottle is upright. Then invert the bottle and attached funnl over the opening. Sounds difficult, but once you get the hang of it, it's simple. I have 4 cats, I was doing this daily. It's not a bad product, just involves a little dexterity. Maybe not worth 55.00, but then, what is? I loved mine. And the humor of watching your pet drinking out of their own toilet...."
1,Very hard to clean.,"Received this thing as a gift in January 2012 for my 18 year old arthritic cat. She took to it quickly, but even with the charcoal filter & using bottled, filtered water, this ""fountain"" is a messy disaster. Impossible to fully dismantle to clean all the gunk out of the corners & around the pump. (& there does not seem to be replacement filters for this thing). Had to finally resort to partially dismantling the intake grid on the pump every few days. Real pain. The liter bottle reservoir is a joke..I just filled up the reservoir surrounding the pump & it worked fine. However, this fountain is cheaply made, brittle & grows more bacteria than a Petri dish!!! This past week, it started leaking through the electrical connection due to a crack in the reservoir. It is in the trash can at the moment. Unfortunately, I have just been informed that this thing is to be replaced by the same fountain. I & my cat are not happy campers!!! Don't buy this thing!!!!"
3,Wrong information.,I'm afraid that some of the song titles that appear in the sample list are not in the CD.
4,Super,"I have listened to this album again and again and it seems convince me that these days, the most popular are increasingly the lest talented. If Lokua is not the best african musician of his generation, he is certainly the best I know.His sense of melody is truely unique and when coupled brilliant musicianship, one begins to understand why this guy would seduce anyone who dare listen to him. The music speaks for itself, and so eloquenty. The guitar lines are elegant and polished. The medolies are full of finesse and creativity. The rest is the talent of Nat King Cole, Bill Evans, and Frank Sinatra, multiplied by 10."
5,Awesome glue,This is really super awesome glue. It works inside and outside and is completely water proof! Get yourself some today!
3,"No complaints with the material, can't say the same for the container","The silicone works fine, the thing is about as big as an average sized toothpaste, i had 1 issues with the container1) not good for several uses, since once you remove the applicator tip and put the cap back on, there is some silicone left in the applicator tip that is impossible to get out, so even if you use it again you'll have to do without the long applicator tip2) the tube itself is very thin obviously, it ripped apart and formed a smallish hole even though i wasn't applying more pressure than is needed."
5,Good medicine for the whole family,"Using his usual, non-nonsense approach Dr. Phil gives us sage advice on the modern family. In an age where family doesn't necessarily come first, Dr. Phil give us ways to improve our family life and put our priorities back where they belong.Debbie Farmer, parenting author of 'Don't Put Lipstick on the Cat!'"
4,Good,The book was in pretty good shape. Other than some writing on the front pages. The rest of it was clean and in good shape
2,Not up to good standard,"I was expecting more from Dr. Phil. Though the book is easy to understand, it was too easy to read. Maybe boring at some parts. It did not interest me much that i had to drop it right at the middle."
3,Doc's Advice,Enjoyed the read. It was very informative and dealt with topics all families deal with. Offers good alternatives and resources if needed. Would recommend this book to anyone interested in improving family relations.
3,Not For Women Who Do Too Much,"If you are a woman who is always doing too much, do not buy this book. While the tips and ideas are good, you will end up stressing out and then likely feeling inadequate because he sets the reader up to fail. His ideals are unrealistic and will only serve to make you feel bad about yourself. No one in the world is healthy enough or has enough time to do everything he says one needs to do to have a ""phenominal"" family. Instead, spend quality loving time with your children and teach them by example."
4,Practical advice,"Once again Dr. Phil gives practical, common sense advice for creating and maintaining positive relationships. In a day when some families are practically strangers meeting in the same house day after day, Dr. Phil's guidance is desperately needed. Gives strategies with his signature humor and warmth. Fun reading even if you have a great family bond"
1,The most backwards approach to multicultural ed. ever!!!,"I have had to use this text for a college course. In reading it, I have been subjected to all sorts of personal prejudices from the authors without any solutions. They have used too many pages voicing their undocumented research in a difficult to read format. The opinions are extreme, with no concrete foundations to back them up. There are constant contradictions in every chapter, sometimes within the same paragraph. This was a waist of college students money!There must be more substancial reading out their on Multicultural Education."
4,Easy to get into the world of multicultural education,"Frankly speaking, this book is easy to understand for a foreigner like me. Banks uses simple words and fluent writing style to sketch the outline of multicultural education. Althought I think it simplifies the content of multicultural education, it's still a good textbook for a person who begins to enter the world of multicultural education."
1,THIS BOOK IS A COMPLETE RIPP-OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I just got my required textbook in the mail and what a shock to find it to be a little paperback with 130 pages of information. This book should cost $14.95 if that and the university wanted $55. I am sick and tired of college students being ripped off by publishers like this. COMPLAIN TO YOUR COLLEGES AND LET YOUR TEACHERS KNOW THAT THIS BOOK IS WAY OVER PRICED. IF I AM GOING TO PAY OVER $50 FOR A BOOK, I WANT IT TO BE WORTH IT. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK AND GET RIPPED OFF LIKE ME!!"
4,Very happy with this phone!,"I got this phone for my business primarily because I have a similar Panasonic version at home with the add on handsets. It's a great product.Right now I'm very happy with this phone and the features. The answering system is easy to use and I can also set it to Not Answer if I only want to play my store hours and directions --- versus taking customer or vendor messages. It was very easy to install, setup and get started."
3,review,"Although I didn't receive this item by the promised date of Dec. 24th for the following day, I did receive it and would consider purchasing from them again."
1,Trash,"Come on guys, my son bought this for me saying that Michael Stipe and David Bowie raved about this band and he knew I was big fans of both. But, from the first cut to the last, it just does not go anywhere. I forget the cut, but the line is "" I don't want to live in America anymore"", well guess what? Head back to Canada. I suggest do not waste your money on this CD."
5,"Delivers more of the same, differently","Everything about this album structurally and texturally is different than Funeral. But both are hard-driving, beautiful works that define the fear and magic inherent in modern life. Funeral was more magic and less fear, but Bible manages to avoid being sloppily polemical and expresses its emotions in a way that is more effective than a ""I hate Bush and MTV"" rant."
3,Disappointing follow-up,"It's a good CD, but compared to Funeral, it's not great... I don't blame them, I was expecting the second coming of Christ since their last one was so great. Still a fan, though."
2,Meatloaf Jr.,"I don't get all the hoopla about AF if this album is representative. Maybe it's that every generation needs a Meatloaf to carry us away from our suburban frustrations? Some okay licks, but most here is earnest, melodramatic, vapid, overproduced, and--at least to my ear--lacking the emotional authenticity of the similarly veined Clap Your Hands Say Yeah."
4,bigger and louder,"Almost as good as ""Funeral"" but you will find yourself pushing the skip button a few more times on this round."
1,This Is Against My Religion,"When I review an album, I review all the aspects of the album.Now to start off, the album title goes against my religion as I am a follower of Islam. The word ""Bible"" deeply offends me and my family. I have to hide this album in my bedroom so my wife and kids do no find it. I am shamed by this.Now for the music. The music is bland, hipster music. I enjoyed Funeral and even the (now) award winning 'The Suburbs', but this one really feels tired no matter how you look at it. The last song ""My Body is a Cage"" is one of their most powerful tunes, but other than that you shouldn't expect much from this (especially the first half)."
3,"Trust me, this is no Funeral.","I was just plain bored with this album. I loved Funeral and the self titled ep, but I guess my hopes were just too high with this one. The difference between Neon Bible and Funeral is that on Funeral the songs actually feel like they had some sort of energy and they all stick out as great tracks. On Neon Bible, everything just feels slow moving, like the album is trying to build itself up for some great payoff in the end, but it fails. it just feels like its chugging along to nowhere, and derailing itself in the process. some of the lyrics on the album are really embarassing too. I think everyone just really wanted to like this album and i think thats why its getting such great reviews from critics and being called a successful followup. I think it sold so many albums because it got mainstream radio play, and i think, in its defense, it is a hell of a lot better than anything else on the radio. it has its moments, but not a whole albums worth like Funeral."
1,Sophomore Slump,"I agree with the previous review that ""No Cars Go"", ""Intervention"", and MAYBE ""Keep the Car Running"" are the best songs on the album, but that is not saying much. The rest of the songs just drone on into oblivion. ""Subtle"" is certainly the word for the opener, ""Black Mirror"". It sets the tone for the entire album. Listening to Butler whine ""Blaaack Mirrooor"" and ""I don't wanna do _____ no more"" for 3 songs is not inspirational in the least. Where are the danceable, 50's diner style rhythms of ""Funeral""? Why are the intricate string arrangements barely audible? The straight, endless 4/4 beats of this recording and buried strings are unacceptable, no matter how much they ""planned it.""The more I listen to this album, the more I realize how good the Arcade Fire's first album was. I love Funeral, but it was the death of this band. And yes, that makes me want to cry. ""I don't wanna listen to Arcade Fire no more."""
3,Sounds wonderful but it's copied from everywhere.,"To me this band--particularly on this album--owe most of their sound to Echo and the Bunnymen. That's no bad thing but at times the tracks are eerily close to many on Porcupine and Ocean Rain.Aside from that there are huge gobbets of Talking Heads in there as well. Plus you get Neil Young influences, bits of The Residents, The Beach Boys, The Cardiacs, The Pixies and Luke Haines among loads of others. It's a weird mix and it never quite gets clear of the records it keeps drawing from.Still it's a good album but it isn't the saviour of contemporary music. If it didn't sound so damn good it would be discarded as another pile of derivative rubbish. What saves it is the brilliance of the playing and the complex arrangements. Shame it doesn't have much of an identity of its own, though. Maybe the band will grow-up and get one."
4,Everybody's Happy,"I ordered this for my 15 year old. He thinks it's cool and it sounds even better really loud. What doesn't?I like it because they sound like a whole bunch of other people: Echo and the Bunnymen, Talking Heads (a little)and it has great arrangements incorporating unusual musical instruments and effects. Haven't heard a huge church organ in a popular song ever?"
5,it is flippin awsome,it is so man i loved reading it and it made it easy for me to under stand the bible it was cool. hippies are people too dont throw things at them. because im a hippie and hippies are cool...i loved these book it was great a book was cool but not as cool as this book.
2,Should be titled The Politically Correct version,"I give this book 2 stars because of its fun facts and helpful, brief overview of the Bible. However, I hope that no one reads this book as their introduction into the Bible. God help them! This book uses the PC terms for AD and BC when we are talking about a book that talks about Christ. How absurd. Second, the overview of Genesis says that the serpent tempted Adam and Eve to eat the apple. I guess the feminists also got to this book, too. Eve was tempted and ate the apple, and then tempted Adam. Its pretty clear. But the overview is not. Third, there are words in the book the editors seemed to have missed because they are spelled wrong. i.e. ""thnk"" on page 13."
1,Missing an imporant word in the title,"The title of this book really should be ""The Bible is for Dummies."" I would ask that the publisher remedy this immediately.That is all, thank you."
3,"Easy reading, lots of information spoon-fed ....","I read most of this book that was assigned in an Old Testament course that was sponsored by my church (an Episcopal church in VA). The book summarizes a lot of information compactly. The negatives are that the authors try too hard to inject humor, using allusions that may seem dated in a few years. Nevertheless, it is a very ""user-friendly"" way to learn what scholars & historians have concluded about how the Bible was compiled."
5,Diane,"This gives a lot of back ground on what, where and when the events take place in each book of the bible great references."
3,Served its purpose,The filters are hard to find anywhere locally so I decided to order them online. The bad part was that they forgot to package the wicks. I ended up having to order the wisks seperately which cost additional.
4,him a de best in da business,"though the tracks of ""on the other side of dub"" are not fully realized dance hall, they follow the basic template: old rythms (in this case, classic studio one tracks) redone with updated lyrics. but don't be detracted; this album would rule your sound system. the lone ranger set the standard for jamiacan djs heading into the 1980s, and this set proves it. ""barnabas collins"" alone is worth the price of admission. the only downside is the straightforwardness of the dubs, but, hey, studio one rythms can stand alone."
3,The Wintrhop Fleet of 1630.,Not exactly what I wanted. No background data on numerous passengers. Expected more accurate data on dates vessels departed and arrived.
2,Not worth the money,The instructions were not very clear but I finally figured out how to remove the cover to load it. The design is ok but the feeder started malfunctioning after only 3 times used. It began continually running and wouldn't stop. This probably explains why the battery was almost run down after the second time I used it. I would be willing to try another one if Amazon will replace it.
3,What they don't tell you,The problem with this machine is that the cover is what moves not the tray with the food. So you have to have this out away from any wall so your pet can walk 360 degrees around it. Most people have their dishes against a wall and next to a water dish. It does work and mine is quiet. Just beware the cover spins not the dish so you need space around it.
1,Annoying Contraption,"The worst thing about this feeder: You have no idea how much food is left. There needs to be clear panels to see through the compartments to know how much food is left.Also, the ice pack compartment seems poorly designed. I had no use for it, but it's not well insulated so I imagine the ice packs being melted much too soon to be of any real use.Another negative is the slow, weak motor that spins the top and reveals the next feeding compartment. It's slow and noisy. Pets are hungry and impatient. My cat would sometimes put his front paws on the cover in anticipation. Eventually, this led to motor burnouts.I've since bought the Petmate Le Bistro which will feed my cat for a month+ without worry/care."
1,Awful item do not buy,"THis item is of very poor quality. It's broken already and I have to return it.The automatic function is bad, it doesn't work. I do not recommend this. Don't buy it."
2,cat broke into it on the third day,"The design is very flawed. The bottom and top do not close completely, and so it is very easy for both human and cat to push the top over to the next food section. If the item were made of sturdier plastic or was more tightly fitted (with perhaps a screwed on top or something) then this feeder would be great. Alas, the ice packs are very thin, and it would have been better had they been electrically chilled instead of relying on ice packs (plus I feel a little nervous about mixing water with electricity, even if it is battery-powered). Also, it was difficult to install the battery - it would have been easier had you been able to pull the link out a little bit so you could snap the V-9 on with both hands and then stick it back in, instead of trying to snap them on at the same time hoping you're not breaking something inside the machine."
3,My puppy broke into it!,I purchased this for my puppy and she broke into it in about 3 days. She scratched at the top and got the whole lid off!! Otherwise this feeder isn't bad if you have an animal who isn't determined to eat all the food in the feeder at once. I was disappointed as I thought it would have some sort of locking mechanism on the lid so it didn't come up so easily. Maybe they need to figure out a way to lock the battery mechanism to the lid!
1,Disappointment Times Two,"I ordered two of these for my two cats. They worked initially, but after about a month, first one then the other, began dying. First the motor starts running slow, like the battery is weak, then it begins cycling back and forth, keeping the tortured cats staring at their food as it appears, then disappears over and over again. Finally they just stop working. I replaced the battery, and it didn't help. If it had been only one acting up, I would have tried exchanging it, but both? Twice the frustration, twice the disappointment.If it worked properly, this product would be a godsend - I have a weird rotating work shift, and I really needed this so I could feed my cats regularly and get uninterrupted sleep too. I guess I will have to go back to leaving food out all the time, even though one of my cats desperately needs a diet. Lucky for me I can return it to Amazon so at least I'm confident that part of the transaction will work."
2,Lack of clock based timer is huge drawback.,"The main drawback of this feeder is the timer only works in 6,12, 24 hour increments which reset every time you auto advance the feeder (to say, fill the dishes with food.) I find this to be a huge inconvenience that takes away much of its usefulness and now feel that the extra cost of a feeder with a clock based timer would have been well worth it."
1,"Poorly designed, no quality control","Trouble started with the first instruction in the manual. It is *very* difficult to remove the center timer module, which must be done to access the food tray. I am sure many buyers will break the cover trying to get the timer out. The battery leads are too short, making the battery difficult to install with secure connections. The manual states that when you reinstall the timer module, ""the motor will spin and lock the dish in place."" Didn't happen on the unit I bought. The manual also states ""The Advance button allows you to rotate the cover manually."" That function didn't work either. Needless to say, this went right back in the box to return to Amazon. The whole thing comes across like a first generation prototype, not a mature consumer product ready for mass production. I would never trust this product to aid in the care of an animal companion. Very disappointing, I give it an F."
1,You gets what you paid for.,I read all the reviews on this and ordered it because of the low price. It started acting up and not working properly within 2 weeks. My cat loved the double feedings but that was not the point. I ended up purchasing a PetSafe 5 Meal Feeder for twice the price at the local PetCo and it works great. It's programmable and has not had one problem in the 3 weeks that I have been using it. Now I have to return the Lentek.
1,Useless,The lid is to easy to get open...the cat lifts up the lid and gets to all of the meals without difficulty. Poor design.
3,"good idea, technically works, cat doesn't eat.","product comes with ice packs to keep food fresh, but ice doesn't last for 6 days. it is a good idea and it is good quality, but the cat doesn't eat the food because it doesn't stay fresh. It is still a piece of mind, and I guess if he were hungry enough he would eat it. Still leave plenty of dry food and water."
3,"One paw yes, one paw no.","I bought two - one for each of my cats - hoping it would help control their feeding habits. This feeder is much larger than I anticipated so finding space on the kitchen floor was a challenge. The younger cat quickly became accoustomed to the sound of the door rotating and comes running. However, my other older cat is a slow eater and did not like holding her face in the dish. Alas, this means her younger friend can push her out of the way and eat her food too. I'm keeping one dish for the younger kitty and returned the second (unused) feeder. My advice: check to see if your cat will eat out of a container that's low and narrow."
4,handy item!,My kitties eat too much if I use a cat food dispenser. This allows me to have control over portion size and frequency of feeding. I use it for dry food only. Has worked very well!
1,Sent back twice,Would only feed once and then never again and the time settings were messed up. Send back for a replacement. Replacement would also only feed once and then never again. Sent back for refund and got a different one with an actual digital timer and it works fantastic!
1,"Too hard to use, bad design","We ended up returning this product. It's very hard to use, the food compartments might be too small for your pet (they really are not that big and we tried to feed a tiny Chihuahua). The device is round so you need to make sure your pet can access it from all angles meaning you probably can not put it next to a wall, having your pet food dish in the middle of the room is not something we liked to do.The worst thing is that taking off the feeder in order to clean and refill the food compartments is just very hard, you need to simply apply a lot of force to release it and then putting it back is also very hard, it must be at a specific angle for some plastic clips on the bottom (which you can not see) and then you must apply lots of force to push it in. I would expect some smarter way that is easy to use for humans and not so much for pets.Returned this product."
3,"Good, but...","The book arrived quickly, and it is in good condition. The only complaint is that it looks like some animal (possibly a dog) got ahold of the top, right-hand corner of the book and decided to nibble on the covers and pages. Other than that, a cursory glance of the text did not show any markings and/or highlighting."
1,agreed: not reliable,I bought one for my mother. It lasted about 4 months. It might be ok for occasional use but not for continuous use.
1,Not for your regular working mom,"I bought Working Mother thinking that it would be filled with great tips on time management, recipes for food kids will actually eat (and don't take all day to prepare) and fashion tips for people who shop at JCPenney, not Banana Republic or Bloomingdales. This wasn't the magazine for that. It might be great for high-end moms who make $100k and have nannies but it seems to be oblivious to other working mom needs."
4,Good articles,"I find that this magazine has a lot of informative articles and provides plenty of information for working mothers, regardless of what industry one may be employed in. It is nice to have a magazine that targets the working professional who juggles home, career and family!"
3,"nice unit, doesn't work with iphone","The iphone 3gs fits, but doesn't work. The holder squeezes the ""volume down"" buttonon the side of the iphone and turns the volume down randomly.Description doesn't say iphone, so that can be expected."
2,not a good review,The product that fits in my cup holder does not go high enough to operate without taking your eyes completely off the road....it is approximately right above lap level. It should adjust to a higher heigth for easier adjustments.
5,Tune Dock,"set it and forget it, it has all the adapters you need for your cup holder, good looking and easy to use, won't change it"
4,A worthwhile addition to any library!,"Spiglanin excels in a nice cross-section of beautifully balanced easy melodies over blue-collar poetry. Like sipping a rare, smooth cognac. One gets the feeling she's in the room, slowly bringing the listener to a state of euphoria. Excellent packaging and production for this hard-working Oakland band that has been steadily refining its unique groove for years. On some tracks, Spiglanin's vocals touch on greatness. Listen for the potential of superstardom in the chorus of ""Division Street"". Then listen again."
3,Just ok for the price.,"It's true you get what you pay for. In this case, I purchased 3 feeders and one of the three just flat out didn't work. The two others will open after either 6 or 24 hours, but most of the time both compartments opened simultaneously. This somewhat defeats the purpose of a compartmentalized timed feeder. If I had it to do over I'd spring for a higher quality product."
1,brittle glue in paperback,The book fell apart upon opening it up. Glue was too brittle.Wish I could have been warned ahead of time.
1,Works about half of the time,I have been trying to get my dogs to press it before they go out but it doesn't help that first it doesn't get the advertised range and second doesn't always work when the dogs do try to hit the button. I wanted to be able to place the doorbell closer to the middle of the house but instead I have to keep it within 10 ft. Anywhere outside of that and it won't work. The only possible explaination outside of it being faulty is if there is interference that I don't know about.
2,great AT FIRST...then stopped working,"Great idea, my dog learned how to ring the bell but it stopped working intermittantly after a few months and then the button started to stick-we heard the ringing continuosly. Again, great idea but need to be made better and they need customer service to replace them.Now I hang large Christmas bells by a rope both inside and out and my dog rings them."
1,Noisey and short life,"My wife bought the Biagiante thermal fridge for me for Christmas, 2003. But it was very noisey from the beginning and it stopped working altogether on May 20, 2004. I realize it wasn't very expensive, but a five month product life is pretty bad. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Doug"
1,"It broke, and they won't fix it.","We got two of these. One of them broke almost immediately, and was replaced. It broke again and was replaced. When it broke the third time, I called and was told it's been discontinued and too bad. Now the second one is broken. These are good for only a very short while. I'd suggest buying something else, and I would never knowingly buy anything from this manufacturer again. Ever."
4,It grows on you,"The first couple of times I listened to this CD, I wasn't sure I liked it. The didgeridoo was cool but Xavier's voice was a bit thin and music had a strong Paul Simon sound. But a couple more listens and it has definitely improved. While Xavier doesn't have a strong voice, it is adequate and his use non-standard instruments (like the didgeridoo and sitar) brings a pleasant uniqueness to his music. Keeping it all acoustic also works with his lyrics and voice. Give it a listen a couple of times. It'll grow on you."
1,self-knowledge??,"The only paragraphs worth reading are the once Heller got from other books, I'd suggest you'd read those if you want to know about the Tsangpo's history.Otherwise this book is a story written by a man who has little to no self-knowledge, but seems to know what Lindgren (the expedition leader) thinks and feels. Heller criticizes others but doesn't have the gut to look at his own actions."
1,Why I picture a car salesman,"Unless you want to read an infomercial on the author's other books and products, do not waste your money on this book. The content is non-substantive and goes into very little detail on ""how to build zero cash into 7 figures."" Hicks gives anecdotal examples of how people who read his books had huge success in real estate throughout the book. I got very tired of the condescending tone of the book and every section seems to start with ""If you follow my process, my good friend, Ty Hicks will make you a success."" I would've never thought this, but, my good friend, I couldn't wait to go back to reading Kiyosaki's Rich Dad series."
1,My friend...my #$#$!,"I went out and bought this book after a minute or two ""scan"" in a bookstore (Yes, I paid retail & tax!...What was I thinking?) A couple of things caught my eye and I left it at that. After about ten pages of the author calling me his ""friend""...I realized that I was STUCK with a thick drink coaster. It really is a big commercial for his other writings. It's loaded with testimonials as filler and no true substance...which is what I look for. I missed the boat here! After the first 100 pages, I'm still waiting for some (whatever that is) useful details. Do I take a gamble and finish this thing?"
3,As advertised,"Customers take note: when the publishers warn that there MIGHT be errors, they're completely correct. I was shocked when I received this book because I hadn't read the full description. As this is a textbook, I'm not too upset about the illegibility of some pages. I also appreciate that General Publishers gives you a pdf of the original for reference. All of their efforts taken into consideration, though, some pages ARE completely illegible. Even getting used to c's and o's and e's being interchangeable, and 1 possibly meaning l or i, I'm not sure this book is worth the price. I suppose that, since you get the pdf, it'll do in most cases."
5,Rescue Your Love Life,excellent. I am a marriage and family therapist and recommend this book to anyone desiring to work on their marriage.'Shawn
5,A Musical Blessing.....,"As a child, I used to listen to the LP over and over again. Years ago, when my family moved I lost the LP. It wasn't until recently, when I heard a pastor reference the song ""Be Grateful"", that I remembered how much I loved that song and how it ministered to my spirit as a child. I'm so grateful that I checked Amazon because I purchased it right away and have been listening to it everyday. Every song is a blessing. ""Be Grateful"" is still my favorite song in the entire world (""He's That Kind of Friend"" is a very close second favorite!). Buy this CD -- you won't be sorry -- and you will be blessed!"
4,Walter Hawkins Love Alive II,I have enjoyed the Walter Hawkins Love Alive II CD tremendously. I was especially glad to find the sound quality was clear and full. I am also very satified with the Amazon.com purchase process.
2,Not For Every Beard,"I bought the Merkur after reading lots of great reviews, and because I have a nostalgia for old fashioned things. I used it for about a month, and then for comparison I switched back to my Sensor Excel. No comparison. For closeness and ease of shaving the sensor was just much, much better. I was really disappointed because I was rooting for the Merkur. In reality I shouldn't have been surprised. How would newer models ever have sold successfully if they were not, in some way, improved? Maybe it's because I have a really tough beard; I can't say for sure. The one place where the Merkur came out ahead was that I noticed I never got any nicks or cuts while using it. But again, I didn't get a close shave either. So, the only thing I can say for sure is that it must be great for some guys (based on the reviews), but it isn't for every beard. For what it's worth, I hope this helps other guys who might be taking a look at the Merkur or other classic safety razors. Happy shaving."
1,worthless,"I purchased this product through amazon a few weeks ago. It's truly a piece of trash. the shave is extremely irritating and it's not closer than a mach 3 or fusion shave. It doesn't adjust to your face; so shaving takes forever, not because you're getting a good shave, but simply because it's too irritating and possibly dangerous. If you want a good, cheap shave. buy Target Brand razors. they are cheap and give you a great shave. thanks"
5,This is really the Merkur 34C Heavy Duty,"This is a fantastic razor. And a great beginner razor for those exploring DE wet shaving. Note this is really the Merkur 34C Heavy Duty. The #178 is just some random number assigned by the distributor.For a great shave, unlearn your Mach3/Fusion holds. Hold the razor as if you're holding a dart (i.e. playing darts at a bar). Let the razors own weight do the shaving. To learn more on how to get a great shave from this razor, watch Mantic59's series of videos on safety razor wet shaving techniques on YouTube."
5,Solid work,"What Zabin does best is to transform dry business material into organic, interesting prose. Well done again. Unlike many similar titles, this book surely won't bore you, and it may even inspire you..."
5,My daughter's favorite,"Similar to many of the other reviewers, I too am a mother who wanted to breast feed. I went back to work less than a month after my daughter was born and had to pump most of the time. Around 3 months of age, I just couldn't keep up with her anymore and had to introduce some formula. We tried the major three brands -- Similac, Enfamil, and Good Start. She didn't want anything to do with the Similac and Good Start. She took the Enfamil with no problem. From 3-6 months she received half breast milk and half formula and had little issues with gas. At six months, I finally gave up pumping. The switch to all formula has been uneventful. She got a little more gassy for a couple days and now is fine. She's having soft bowel movements. The Enfamil mixes very easily unlike my experience with Similac where it clumps in the bottle. The powder is much more fine in the Enfamil. I'm very pleased with my Enfamil experience and would recommend it to anyone."
3,Queen Of Its Day,"This is the first in the long series of Ellery Queen stories- it's quaint, very dated, and enjoyable, and mostly significant for its place in the history of the genre- old school mystery. In other words, nobody gets punched in the jaw or uses bad grammar.Revolving around a setting- the theatre- and a prop- a top hat- that symbolize Ellery Queen's place in time very well, this one takes a little while to get going, but it's a worthwhile and enjoyable read. I'm going to take advice from the reader from Kansas (below) and give these guys (uncredited authors Dannay and Lee) another chance with a later entry in the series.If you can possibly lay hands on Otto Penzler's beautiful facsimile of the first edition, by all means do so."
5,dig vanhal,"Vanhal's symphonies are engrossing and beautiful. That he is an undiscovered country, makes them all the more surprising and lovely."
5,good learning tool,The kids really like to play this game and they learn the concepts quickly. At least until they broke the CD! But that's how often it was used.
5,Essential Moisture Bath is definitely a MUST HAVE!!,"Newborns have really delicate skin, and if your's is like my daughter, will break out very easily when washed with a harsher soap.This baby bath was great for washing body AND hair for her whole first year. Never dried her skin out ONCE.We had received other types as gifts and returned them all when we saw how her skin became dry and red when we used them on her.Super super super!! Cannot say enough great things about the Aveeno baby products!I plan to use them again on my new arrival due in May."
4,Zakk Wylde might be a god!,"I just picked up this bad boy, and it hasn't left my player since. This album is super heavy, and it's not real hard to tell who's playing guitar. Zakk's style reminds me of his days with Ozzy. But what really blew me away was the strength in Zakk's voice! It's incredible! As comparision I'd say he sounds similar to Pepper Keenan of Corrosion of Conformity. But that strength is also the only down fall of this amazing recording. The vocals seem to be lost in almost every song...drowned out by his need to wail away on guitar. Still, the album rocks! It's super heavy and has a meld of sounds that remind me of C.O.C, Pantera, and Ozzy. If you're thinking about buying this...you have my support. Just be ready to thrash around the house!"
2,Did you really think it was good?,"Was this CD, along with the previous BLS release, recorded on a four track? The mixing is poor, making the vocals difficult to hear at times. The drums sound terrible and Zakk has to quit putting his signature guitar squeal into every single song. I really wanted to like this but unfortunately for me it's a major disapointment. The vocals, mix and song writing on Book of Shadows is much better. Don't get me wrong I like heavy stuff, this just isn't good quality heavy stuff."
1,Nothing More than Zakk writing filler material..,"Well, this album surely disappointed me... Zakk tried a new approach, it seems, but the result backfired. THis album is heavy and distorted just for the sake of being have and distorted. There is no chemistry between the songs, no real soul into them, no real composing skills are displayed here.Zakk's vocals are also below his potential, that's a sure thing... HE's just growling like if he wanted to be Phil Anselmo..."
2,Extremely hard to listen,"I think Zakk wanted so hard to show how ""radical"" he is, how ""independentt"" he is, so he exagerated a little bit in this album. It's heavy, no doubt, but it's so ""dirty"" that makes Pantera seems like Bon Jovi in comparison....Didn't like it... Writing his own songs without Ozzy around proved to be no easy task for Zakk..."
5,The First Good Hard Rock Album of the Decade,"This album suprised the hell out of me. I don't know what I was expecting, but it sure wasn't this. Zakk takes the best qualities of Sabbath influenced classic metal, Alice in Chains hard rock, and early stomp metal and mixes them perfectly with his awesome guitar playing to create a new sound. On some songs he even toys around with what could eventually, perhaps a few albums down the road, turn into thrash and death metal. Whatever the style of the song, each one rocks in it's own way."
2,cute but don't fit well,I really thought these shoes were so darling but they are not very comfortable. The feel like they are not on my foot all of the way and as a result I have to walk stiffly to keep them on. I think that I may send them back since I have only worn them once.
3,"Book seemed good, but I returned it","Four or five stars for the book. But I only got through the first few pages.The pages are glossy, highly reflective, and the font is very small, while the margin is wide and pages not well utilized. 1 star for the execution.I recommend the books from the little that I read, just not this edition."
4,Looks great and fast delivery as usual!,"It is a Chrsitmas present so I did not open the books... And I am not sure I would understand anyway. But the books look great, the price was ok compared to other sellers and the delivery was quick and reliable as usual with Amazon. Recommended!"
3,"Poignant, self-centered","Elaine Mar has recorded a poignant story which, sadly, fails to demonstrate any interest in any person beyond herself. Her tale follows her family's move from Hong Kong to Denver and documents the struggle of her young self to adjust to her new home and strange culture. She eloquently describes the difficulties of living in a relative's house, the challenges of fitting in at her school, the awkwardness of choosing between her Chinese family and her new American friends. Constrained by her mother to act like a lady (according to the oppressive rules of Chinese culture), burdened by her family's poverty, tormented by racist classmates, Elaine grows up silent and resentful -- a model student but a troublesome and wayward daughter. With her entrance to Harvard at the end of the book, she completes her effort to separate herself from her embarrassing family and all that they represent. Where she has come, they are, finally, unable to follow."
2,Could Have Been Better,"It was a sometimes interesting, very good FIRST DRAFT of a book.I don't blame the writer.The editing should have been more strenuous.Some accounts go on forever, some important parts get glazed over.But more than anything, the memories are just random bits. Nothing ties it all together, so to speak. And the ending is abrupt.This book was about a year's work from being done.I would encourage Ms. Mar to keep writing.On a personal note...as an immigrant who came to the U.S. the same year and at the same age as Ms. Mar, I hope she has come to a place of acceptance, forgiveness, and love with her parents.I felt very sorry for her, and more so for her family at the end of the memoir. The way it was written made it almost seem like it was her family and not just college she had graduated from.I hope she has found a way to incorporate her family into her life.I did learn a lot about Chinese-American culture and found it edifying to read her experience."
1,This book spews dogmatic nonsense,"There does not exist any scientific studies to verify and document Hubbard's rather bigoted notions about human behavior in this book. Hubbard writes at long length about an emotional scale that he called ""The Tone Scale"". In his ""Chart of Human Evaluation"", he claimed that certain personality characteristics bind to other characteristic behaviors or physiological conditions. I read this book from cover to cover and have never found the data that Hubbard claims as true to bear out in the real world.If you want to predict human behavior, I suggest studying the subjects of psychology, sociology, economics, and linguistics. Those fields will give you a genuine understanding of how us humans conduct our affairs as individuals and in groups. The pat dogma that Hubbard claims in this book is utter nonsense. Do not waste your time or money on it."
4,Good hoof pick but a bit soft,"These are nice hoof picks - I had hoped the ""blade"" was somewhat harder than it is; it bends pretty easily. Still better than the very cheap hoof picks though."
2,Doesn't lock,Master lock product that doesn't lock! What the %$#@! The picture is deceptive. But otherwise it does work. Don't buy this.
4,Nice treatment of a rare film,"Not sure whatever became of Elite Entertainment but thanks to them, this pretty rare film is preserved in a nice widescreen DVD, for curious horror fans like myself to (re)discover. Don't wish to give away too much but there's quite a few twists and turns in the plot and although tame by modern standards, it's 70's gore effects are effective for the most part."
1,duplication,"I was greatly disappointed because the on-line description was vague and this DVD was mostly a duplication of episodes I had previously purchased. I really rate this ZERO stars but, you have to check at least 1."
5,great cd,"This cd is great for anyone who is in the mood for some good acoustic rock. Jack Johnson mixes blues, folk, acoustic, pop, and rock all into one amazing cd. I recomend this cd to everyone. it has something on it for eveyone to enjoy."
5,Groovey Acustics,"A mix of Ben Harper and G Love and Special Sauce. I love groovey, acustic music and this disc has all of that. I had first heard of Jack Johnson from the song Rodeo Clowns that Jack Johnson did with G-Love and the Special Sauce and if you have heard and like that song, you will love this disc."
5,Jack Johnson has a lot to say on his debut,"I listen to this album all the time and seem to pick up something new with every listen. Jack Johnson has the style that only a down to earth, genuine human being who isn't wraped up in the music business could. Hopefully he will tour again with Ben Harper because those two go hand in hand. They are both amazing artists and their music is worth anybody's time."
3,medio-core,"this cd is pretty good, it has like 6 or 7 good songs on it, the rest are boring, im a huge Jack Johnson fan, i really like ""On and On,"" buy that one before you buy this one"
5,Smooth,"Get this CD if you like mellow, yet awesome beats. Saw him twice this week live. Best intimate concert I've been to, ever. Reminds me of Dave Mathews or Ben Harper, with Sublime sounding beats."
2,Simplistic Rhyming,"I too was a big fan of ""Flake"" and immediately rushed out to buy this c.d. after hearing others rave about it.Unfortunately, the rest of the c.d. did not live up to the promise of ""Flake"" or even ""Bubbletoes"". Jack Johnson has a terrible tendancy in his songwriting to go with the rhyming lyric--not just in one song or two but EVERY SONG. (case in point: ""Sexy Plexi"").The end result is not sophisticated or elegantly written lyrics as one might expect from a celebrated folksy/bluesy writer, but inane phrases. He chooses the easy, simple rhyme rather than going for more emotionally moving and/or intellectual storytelling. I felt your average fifth-grader could've written these lyrics (or even better ones). Bob Dylan he is not."
3,Fun and smooth CD,"I do love this cd. I would give it more stars if it had more orginal meldies or broke some new ground. Instead it's more like simon and Garfunkel meets Beck on the approximated rap vocal side, which is not necessarily a bad thing. It's not brilliant, but it's nice enough. Jack takes you on a journey and tells a great story, with great hooks. If you like G-love, which i really don't, you will love this cd. Johnson is less concerd with how you much you like him and just how great he is then G-love (The best track G-love has Jack John's wrote). Instead Johnson speaks of love, isolation and times remembered. His words flow and beg you to sing along.Stand out tracks: Inaudible Melodies, Posters, Flake, Mudfootball and F-Stop Blues."
5,I love Jack Johnson!,"The first I heard of Jack Johnson was when my dad and his girlfriend were listening to Bubble Toes, the sixth song, which happens to be my favorite. My dad had dedicated it to her because she has big eyes, (Her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes). At first I thought that was kind of weird how she had bubbly toes, but then i fugured out that he lived in HAWAII!!! surfing for u slow people! but anyway, i highly recommend this cd! u should buy it! they're all pretty good songs though! i also recommend vanessa carlton, michelle branch, avril lavigne, the spongebob soundtrack, and the legally blone soundtrack, if you're planning on going on a cd spree anytime soon!"
2,This is SOOOOOO.........disapppointing,"I bought this album because the San Francisco ""underground"" touted it as a great piece of music. I should have figured that once the Bay area's mainstream newspapers began hyping it, something was wrong. All I can say is that most people in my opinion will be extremely disappointed with this CD..."
2,A very poorly written album...,"Sure, Jack Johnson may be the flavour of the week, but has anyone actually listened to his lyrics? They're terribly unoriginal and not very well composed. The actual music is beautiful, but Johnson can't write lyrics to save his life (rhyming 'football' with 'football' is a poor lyrical decision regardless). This overall detracts from the album, since it's very hard to enjoy his amazing guitar-playing when his lyrics are so awfully distracting in their poor composition. Hopefully, he'll correct his mistakes by the time his next album comes out, but for now, this record should have been released as an instrumental..."
4,Great New Artist,"I came across this CD when one of my friends was listening to it. The music was familiar but when I asked who it was I hadn't heard of Jack Johnson before. I am now hooked on the cd adn have been passing it on to friends adn they love it too!! My favorite song is ""Flake."" I think this guy is gonna be really big!!"
4,mellow my mind,saw jack open for ben harper in providence. after a long day at work i just sat back and took in the cool vibe. i was so intrigued with the sound i bought the cd. jack's great voice combined with some catchy music produced one effort i'll be listening to for some time.
1,I can't wait for the Ween remix.,"Quite simply, the worst thing I've heard in years. No redeeming social value, the most depressingly banal drivel imaginable. Music to soothe the straitjacketed. No interesting chordal, rhythmic, or lyrical content. I hope to never meet any of the fine folks who gave it 5 stars.I did not care much for it. If I could give it negative stars, I would."
5,awesome CD,"I hadn't heard of this guy until I was listening to a station in Boston over the Internet. When I heard ""Bubble Toes"", I went out and bought the CD."
5,doesn't leave the CD player,"i often find myself listening to cds and thinking, ""I would have turned down the bass there"" or ""more guitar there would have improved that chorus."" but those critiques are absent from this album. of course, this is not the perfect album; but very rarely does a cd stay within an arm's length of the driver's seat for weeks upon end. i agree with one of the other reviewers: musically, the DMB comparison is not all that accurate. However, this cd captures me in the same way that dave matthews does... you know, the rhythms and flow that just kind of hang in the air all day long."
5,Jack,Jack is one of the best new artists out there today. His acoustic rhythmic tracks are unbelievable. And to think he almost didn't put out a cd because he already had two of the best surfing documenteries ever. I cannot wait to see JACK with Dispatch in Central Park. And even though i hope Jack does not blow up i encourage everyone to buy his cd.
5,The best collection of early reggae I've ever heard,"I'm serious! I've looked all over and heard some of the worst. When I found #9 (it was the first one I got my hands on) I felt that if I could find them all I would never have to look for early reggae/ska/dub ever again. My girl friend marveled to hear there was more than Marley, Tosh, Cliff and Toots out there. Of course, maximum respect to my boys, but let's give the others some play. As Sir Lord Comic so eliquently puts it ""Here I bring you the rythm of the day, for you to swing and sway the Lord Comic way everyday HA Ha..."
1,Terrible!,"It does not do what it claims to do, therefore I give it one star. I wish I could give it zero stars, though. The cloths actually scratch CDs and DVDs. They also leave lint residue on the CDs. As one other reviewer mentioned, the cloths really do look like fabric softener sheets that you put in the dryer. Don't waste your money on these ""cleaning"" cloths."
2,Disappointed with product,"I received the product quickly, however, I was very disappointed with the actual product. Each sheet is much smaller than I expected. I need 2-3 sheets to clean one disc. I would not buy product again."
2,almost useless,not so powerful for real work. special shaped sand papers are hard to get with relatively lower price.
2,a bit disappointing,"definitely not as good and COCO BEFORE CHANEL, which is a classic in my eyes and I view it often. This account is lumbersome/long/disjointed and just not as much fun as the other"
3,Entertaining but flat,This was a visually interesting film and the music was sometimes good. Yet it seemed flat. For example there were so many scenes when intelligent people would have been talking with each other about their situations and feelings and these two and often the wife just sort of looked at each other mysteriously. It just did not click.Even less sophisticated people would have talked more. In this sense and others the characters were just not developed. One got the impression that the filmmakers were over their heads in trying to get into the characters. So we are left with an affair between two famous people in a beautiful setting.Okay.
2,Jo's Boys,I haven't finished this book. I really loved Little Women and Little Men but just could not get into this one.
5,You are covered for all days!,"Light , heavy or medium, this product covers all the days. The multi-pack is a great way to not worry about having picked the right one, all are included."
3,Boring Murder Mystery,"The life and murder of Professor Culianu should have made an interesting story. However, the book was boring, it did not match Culianu's reputation and great work."
5,A Brilliant Album,"Bill Frisell is one of the best musicians around today; not because of chops, not because of complexity, but just because what he plays is beautiful. What happened to the days when people listened to music because they enjoyed it? Also, the music on the CD is impossible to label. Instead it's a mix of all American music: jazz, blues, gospel, rock, country...etc. What's impressive about Bill Frisell is how he can mold all these styles seamlessly and not miss a beat. Listen to it, enjoy it."
5,Tumblers,"I have purchased these tumblers twice. The first eight are still being used in the home--for several years--and the second eight went into the RV. They meet my needs because they are nearly unbreakable, can be washed in the dishwasher and they have a nice size base which discourages tipping over."
4,cute sock monkey,I order the sock monkey to add to my daughter's monkey collection. It is really cute. It seems to be made well. My daughter loved it!
5,Sock Monkey Rules!,"This is my present from Santa because I was a good girl this year! My brothers and I each had a sock monkey friend as kids and they all liked each other too! Maybe I'll give this one to my brother instead; after all when the giving hurts a little, that's the greatest gift!"
5,One of my all time favorite sf books,"I ordered this because I loved it as a child and wanted to read it to my son. The night I opened it I stayed up until I was finished with the whole book.It's a great story, by a great author. These old SF greats like Sturgeon, Heinlein, Van Vogt and Asimov are worth reading over and over"
2,Painful. Very.,"This book went to a galaxy far, far, astray from the trilogy. References to it where made, but it just didn't seem like it was connected. If you just rode on the Tilt a Whirl, don't read this. There should be a surgeon generals' warning something like this-WARNING: THIS BOOK MAY CAUSE DIZZINESS AND NAUSEA. DON'T TAKE WITH FOOD. I think someone who reads those cheap romance novels and has never seen any of the trilogy, just listened to what some friend told him wrote this. If you like Princess Leia this hurts. A lot."
3,Gives Book Reviewers a starting point...,"This book is an easy read and offers lots of advice that will make the job/task of writing a book review or book report easier. While most of us realize that giving our opinions on a book we've read is something we do verbally without preparation at the drop of a question -- writing a report/review takes preparation and time. In this book you get hints on what to take notes on, how to document so that when it comes time to write the report the information you need is easily found. There's also lists of questions for each genre type that can help to focus your approach.Simply, useful overview for beginning reviewers."
5,It's like we are right there with the characters,"I love reading books that transport you into the character's lives, this is no exception. Amazing writing and great portrayal of racial bigotry in the South US that is still prevalent today."
2,An interesting view,"I thought it was kind of boring, but I did learn some stuff the indiands felt from their side. It was kind of interesting how at times I felt sorry for them and were on their side, but when the white people talked about how evil they are, I sometimes agreed with them too."
2,The dim light in the forest,"The Light in the Forest by Conrad Richter is not a book teens should read because it lacks excitement. For example, there was never any confict between True Son and his siblings. All his brothers and sisters fight, and including a sibling confrontation would have enhanced the book. In addition, after True Son left his indian home to be with his biological parents, he had many conflicts at his house and nothing was resolved. For example, the reader never discovered weather he gets back to his biological siblings. As you can see the book never had high points. It is not recomended for middle school readers."
4,Good book with good detail of Indian traditions.,I realy like this book. The description of traditions and feelings of the Indians is great. I learned a lot about life and about the Deleware Indians from this book. I am a member of The order of the arrow which is a secret group of scouts based souly on the traditions and ceremonys of the Deleware indians. This book lead to a lot of new information that I did not yet know and I was glad to learn more. This is a must read for all readers!
2,Sooooo boaring,This was the worst book I ever had to read in school. It was boring from cover to cover. Don't read this book unless you want to be bored.
4,The Light in The Forest,"The Light in the forest is an interesting story.It was about a boy named John Butler., but then he was adopted by an Indian warrior which was his father and, became Tru Son. He was raised him to live like an Indian. At fifteen he had to move back with his biological father John Butler and his new family . He did not like them . They wanted him to act and dress like them ,But all he could think about was his love for his real family the Indians."
1,"Is"" The Light In The Forest a good book""?","I didn't think it was a good book at all. It was really boring, and didn't make since at all. Every paragraph it was like it skipped to a differant chapter."
2,"After interesting start, there is an awful end","The book started out great. It had character developement and everything. But once True Son had gone to his white family's house, it went spiraling downhill."
3,Okay book. I wouldn't read it agian.,"I read the book for reading. It was a good book, but it was a let down at the end. The author, Conrad Richter, could of added more. Over all l would not recommend the book to my younger sister."
3,"Although this was a Historic Fiction, thFiris was an OK book",What a great book. It was a heartwarming tale of a boy torn between his white family and the Indian Family that he was raised by.
2,This was my home work,"This book was my homework assignment. I personally I hated it for all of the Indian words. Otherwise the book was pretty good. It was about a white boy who was taken by Indians and raised as their own. One day many years down the line, the boy's white parents find him and take him back to white civilization but the boy was with his Indian parents so long that he dosen't wan't to go with them. So one day he tries to escape from them. He meets one of his Indian friends. He tells him his other friend had been scalped. When he finds out who it was--maybe you should find out your self."
1,"DEPRESSING, BORING","Awful, just awful. Richter has gone to an all time low. Not only did the book fail to excite me just once, but it put me in a bad mood. The book is sad without any joy to balence that. I feel sorry for anyone who has to read this book, but for those of you who who are not required, do not waist your time or money on this piece of garbage."
2,The light in the forest,This book was very boring at times. but sometimes is was OK. overall i didn't enjoy it.
2,A waste of time,I had to read this book for a History class. There were far too many Indian words which made boring. I didn't like the ending at all because it just ends and you never know how his life turns out. I would not recommend reading this book.
1,This book isnt as good as I thought it would be.,I am required to read The Light in the Forest and do not like it at all. I chose this book out of 5 others because i like Indian stories and history. This book was a total let down.
3,It was good,"The Light in the Forest was about a white boy who was adopted and raised by Indians. His indian name is True Son. He meets his real father after years and doesn't belive that it's his dad. Once he is with his white family he plans an escape to go back to his Indian family. When True Son gets back with them, he makes the Indians betray him and they disown him forever. I think it was a good book."
4,not too sour,I picked up the taste for pickled onions when i lived in England. If they make you squint when placed in your mouth theyre just right. These were pretty close to perfect for me but I like the London Pub ones better. I also tried Judy's sour pickled onions but they were too sour for me.
4,LOOKS GOOD,EVERYTHING IS GOOD AND LOOKS LUXURIOUS. BUT THIS COMPANY IS APT TO MISS SOME PARTS. YOU MUST CHECK IT CAREFULLY.
4,Good value,"These chairs are sturdy and can hold large people without issue, even though they are compact size. Perfect for eat-in kitchens."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY>>>IT IS NOW NOV, AND I STILL DO NOT HAVE COMPLETE SET SET> CHAIRS ARE SMALL ALMOST MINIATURE>>>HAD TO HAVE CHAIR REPLACED DUE TO DAMAGE IN FACTORY> TWO TABLES AND STILL CAN NOT GET A COMPLETE SET!!!!!! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER"
4,Season 10 pushed too soon?,"If you're as big a fan as I am, you have already bought and watched season 10. Having owned the first nine seasons, nothing would stop me from buying the last. But..Episodes aside, the DVD extras seemed rather weak and slapped together. Remember, these episodes aired for the first time about a month ago!Not every episode has a commentary track either. The ones that do feature relatively uninteresting people, providing very little insite (who cares to hear from the director of lighting for an hour?) Being a huge fan that has seen every episode a dozen times, I really looked forward in the past to watching it again ""along side"" Peter DeLouise, Andy Mikada, and some other favorites.You'll find a lot of loooong pauses in the chat as well during some of the episodes. Why? We find out that some of the commentaries were taped early on a Sunday morning with our featured guests half asleep."
2,Murder and torture?,"The Gate and Atlantis have always been a shoot em up bang bang, however the last two seasons have the ""good guys"" descending to unnecessary murder and torture. The service however was 5 star."
4,good deal,"excellent tv show to watch, great price, came in no time, full of adventure and action, always something new going on"
5,wunderbar,"WOW ... great great greatwe love, won't miss it, sounds wonderfulBut ... no wind, no sound ... we got it and there wasn't a breeze stirring since ... sigh"
1,AWFUL!!!,"Please, stay away from this movie. I love movies and to me was a 1:30 hours of wasting time. It does not make any sense from beggining till end."
1,Totally sucked,"I like end of the world movies, if there is a good story, SAVE YOUR MONEY, this like al gore produced and directed it. I like William Dafoe, he just lost a lot of credibilty on this movie."
2,Too small,"This one is also very expensive and too small. I can,t use it with my big aquarium. Sealer should but the actual size in amazon website."
5,"Simple, Clear, and Logical","This book is possibly the best design education text I've seen. Everything is kept simple, and clear. Ellen Lupton's categorizing of typeface styles, for example, is logical and all inclusive, yet still a simple breakdown of the vast variety of typefaces. She is easier to understand than Robert Bringhurst in ""The Elements of Typographic Style,"" something crucial to any budding designer. This book will serve you well."
3,Scooby-Doo Costume,"I bought the small (4-6) for my 5-year old, who is of average size, and it was almost too short (in the body) for him. You might want to buy up a size if your child is at the middle or top end of the size range. Otherwise, I was pleased with the costume."
2,Ridiculous sizing,"These costumes are ridiculously sized. My son wears a 4/5. I ordered 4-6, which NOW I see is supposed to fit a 3-4 yr old. That's not smart sizer people!!! I'm sure every mom expects to order this and get a 4-6 that fits a 4-6T! You don't know it either until you read the package that you are shipped."
2,Not Inspiring,This is a daily account ot their lives. It can be overwhelming and mundane. Not one I would reccomend.
1,"Please, follow the advice in this book...","This convicted felon is brazen in the unethical, unscrupulous, and (in many local jurisdictions) illegal ""advice"" he spews forth. A lot of it is just plain stupid, so, if you'd like to be a slumlord-cum-convict, be my guest.For more information on this criminal, see the Washington City Paper, July 15, 2005, pp. 11-12."
2,rather disappointing,"This very short video (6 minutes) seems to show more text than film - not what I expected. The parts of the film showing the baby's self attachment (to its mother's breast after birth) are extremely short, i.e. over in seconds. This is disappointing considering that in reality the proces can take up to 50 minutes. The part showing a medicated baby (during labour) not self attaching after birth is a little longer but still over in less than a minute. The statistic of the study are not clearly presented."
3,Just OK,"It's hard to argue with the rationale for this book, or with any of the doctrinal positions. So why not a five-star review? Because the book promotes a poor sense of proportion. A critique of ""Wild at Heart,"" which I have not read, gets as much space as an analysis of an (unconvincing) diatribe against altar calls. It just didn't make much of an impact on me, except the chapters written MacArthur himself."
5,Truth entails discernment.,"MacArthur (and his team of pastors) does a great job at reemphasizing the primacy of God's Word, over all cultural fads. This book addresses many items of our church that have fallen off the side of truth and wandered into the fields of entertainment, pride and false doctrine.Written from a strong and supported Scriptural basis, this book examines even the format and focus of church worship, music and preaching - placing it at obvious odds with Warren-style mega-churches. But MacArthur is uncompromising in his allegiance to Scripture for his guiding principles, and does not simply follow the passing appetites of sinful man.If you're tired of watered-down church ideas, read this and be guided back into God's Word. Read this and be strengthened and emboldened to stand firm against the tides of emotionalism, emergent doctrines and the host of ""feel good"" ideas driving much of our churches today."
3,read it for a class,I read this for my Latino Writing class. Other than that I was bored througout the whole book. The only times I really enjoyed this story were when we discussed this in class.
1,ugh,"I thought this book was terrible. It was over-sentimental and annoying. The language was simple and unsophisticated, as were the thoughts behind the words. I would definitely suggest NOT reading this book, especially if you have read other books in this 'genre,' by such authors as julia alvarez, isabel allende, and ana castillo, or gloria anzaldua. you will be terribly disappointed and mad at yourself for wasting time on this book."
4,Nice basic song book,"Getting back into playing the piano, this was a perfect start around Christmas. I wish there were a few more common songs but this was a nice re-introduction for me."
2,Mostly Simple Melody - with Typos,"This book is mostly a basic melody of Christmas carols. I say ""mostly"" because there are a few typos. In the words, it doesn't matter much because you understand what they are trying to say, and we all pretty much know the words. However, when notes in the melody are written incorrectly, it can really cause difficulty in playing.Good concept for a beginner Christmas book, but they really needed to proof-read once more before publishing."
2,Depends COMPLETELY ON THE BIRD,"I got this for my parakeet. She hated it. She wouldn't put it on for me, and she screeched and bit it furiously. But it all depends on whether or not the bird's willing to stand for this. the only way to get it on is to manhandle it if it's a small bird. The bigger ones just might bite your head if you bend down to fix its feet... And they can wriggle loose. i feel bad whenever i put it on my bird. she looks lopsided and walks like a drunken monkey"
5,The Coalwood Way is magic,"Today, I heard Homer speak to a group of Tech Prep educators in Charlotte. His talk moved many in the audience to tears and cheers. I hadn't read his book, just seen the movie, so I decided to give his new one a try. I am now a committed fan. He really knows how to tell a story, out loud, and in a book. He said Rocket Boys was being taught in a lot of English classes and some the teachers at the conference confirmed it. Now I know why. Coalwood Way is a moving tribute to a small town, to parents, to teachers, and to life."
5,variety at last,"I am a Principal Dancer with the RWB in Canada and I am always looking for new music to work with and I really enjoyed the new music played in this cd (many things I've never heard before in class) and adding the sound of the violin make's a great combination, it completely changes the mood for every excercise, and makes you enjoy class.Dancers use music for class everyday so we are always looking for something new, so congratulations for this new cd and I hope there will be many moreJaime Vargas"
1,Don't depend on this book,The book presents a comparatively superficial overview of the material on the exam. It has nowhere near the depth required to prepare you for this exam. It is virtually a carbon copy of the workstation (70-210) book in the series. Do not depend on this book alone to prepare you for the exam.
4,Leaside - Love It,"An excellent text highlighting the history of railways, housing and industry in the former town of Leaside. Lots of photographs and facts.Definately one of the most interesting local history texts I've ever read."
2,Big White wasn't funny - Beer League good but does not make up the difference,"Robin Williams wasn't funny at allBeer League is that silly ""heart-warming"" comedy - but the herpes jokes kind of ruin it for me."
4,BABY KRAUS AT HIS BEST!,"I SAY BABY KRAUS BECAUSE THIS RECORD HARKS BACK TO THE FIFTIES. iMAGINE KRAUS'S FLOR ROJA! AND AUSENSI IS AWESOME. BY THE WAY, ANOTHER PRESSING OF THIS RECORDING, ON A DIFFERENT LABEL, IS GOING FOR $70+, SO GET THIS ONE! THERE IS NOT YET AN ALL STAR CAST. IN THE ANGELES GULIN RECORDING, THE TENOR IS, TO PUT IT CHARITABLY, A MESS. PUT UP WITH THE BOXED SOUND FOR THE SAKE OF KRAUS'S SINGING. IT'S WORTH IT."
2,Not the greatest,"I purchased this a while back to train for a half marathon, while pushing my baby. I have many issues with this. The biggest being it is WAY too big. Don't plan on putting it in your car, because it won't fit (And I have an SUV). It doesn't fold down. The only thing you can do is take off the front wheel and that doesn't even help much. So unless you plan on starting your run from your driveway, thats the only way you are gonna get it to travel anywhere with you. I am a small person, and I can't help but feel like I am pushing a tank as I am jogging down the street. It is a bit awkward to handle as well. I really don't recommend this stroller at all, especially if you are a petite person."
2,Exciting Novel!,"I am in seventh grade, so the Ox-Bow incident was a little hard to read, but it was a very exciting book. It definitely builds the suspense stronger and stronger as it progresses. I recomend this book to anyone who is looking for a Western adventure."
2,Did not live up to the expectations!,"I've been a die-hard fan of Griffin's books since the first time I picked up the first ""Presidential Series"" book. Hence I was very eager to get my hands on the latest installment of this series, ""The Hunters"". The book started off at a good pace in Hungary but as it progressed the protagonist got involved in endless discussions with various agencies and the storyline kind of dragged on without much steam. I honestly had trouble reading till the end. I have also started disliking Griffin's idea of removing female characters from the stories abruptly. This time it was with Betty Schneider. She was seldom mentioned during the entire story and at the very end she just ditches Charley!! I've seen similar ending with his other female characters in the other series that he has written (""Men in Blue"").I really hope that he brings in a bit more action in his next installment of the ""Presidential Series"" which is due in January 2008."
2,the hunters,"Twenty years ago or so I picked up my first W.E.B. Griffin novel & I was hooked. Loved most of the Brotherhood Of War series & The Corps series became a favorite that I have reread many times. The Honor Bound series is another good historical novel collection though a little weak compaired to Griffins other work.Griffins latest work is lacking whatever spark he had in his previous series. The Presidental Agent series just doesn't have what it takes to keep me reading late into the night. The latest release, The Hunters, can be summed up as booring in the extreme. The plot drags as the characters repeat themselves over & over throughout the novel. Griffin must be getting paid by the word.I believe that I will pay closer attention to other reviews in the future & stop purchasing hardback editions. Very disappointed."
4,The Hunters,"I totally enjoyed this Book, AND on these cold Michigan days and nights it was a pleasure to Read this next installment of W.E.B.Griffin, I wanted to the story to good on and on, and can't wait for the the next book in this series..I feel I know these people, I love the pace of the story as well as the Presidential Finding concept..A good read and for the W.E.B.Griffin fans out there ""we can't hardly wait for the next book of his""Bruce Spears"
5,Griffin is great!,"Like all of Griffin's books that I have had the pleasure of reading, this one also is hard to put down in order to eat a meal!"
2,THE HUNTERS (A PRESIDENTIAL AGENT NOVEL),"Griffin's writing continues to be intriguing. However, the book is full of typo errors.For some reason it refers to all married women as ""Mr."" It takes the reader some time to decide whether Griffin is referring to the wife or the husband.Words are run together so that poor Charley Castillo had to stand ""atease"" before his superior officer instead of at ease. etc.I'm not used to buying books that are full of errors."
4,Another good Griffin read,"It would be nice if he could just bring us up to speed once, at the start of the book, to refresh our memory of where we left this set of characters. Then he would not have to keep going over it as the story progresses.The action is pure Griffin and much better than that in the books he writes with his son.Overall, hard to put down - plan on some late nights of reading as you get involved with the plot."
1,Have battery charging issue,The battery is not charging. I have put in a new battery too and it still did not charge and makes me believe phone is defective.
5,this is not a toy. it is a blanket,my grown daughter loves anything winnie the pooh. now she loves this blanket. she keeps it as a throw on her bed. she really likes it a lot so it must be nice.
4,Another must-have for a Forgotten Realms reader,"Action in its finest form, appealing plot twists, and a very human character. Human in the sense of her attitude, of course, as she's pretty resistant. The plot always made me want to know the next events, and I couldn't let it down. Again, a great work of Ed Greenwood."
3,"No Greenwood's best, but...","Though the characters are a little flat and the plot a simplistic, the book was still a good read. The story has everything that a TSR book should, including the the dim but honourable soldiers, egotistic wizards, a sexy heroine who is almost godlike, and of course the all powerfull villian. But that is also the books problem because it becomes too pridictable and repetative in some of the action sequences."
1,zero stars,"As a physicist I thought this book would be handy to have around, but my experience with it suggests that the authors' goal was to use as many trees as possible while providing as little information as possible. After a while I started looking up topics that I was already familiar with, and was amused by the totally opaque definitions I found. A whole lot of not much in this book. zero stars."
2,not up to expectations,"I loved the baking book for its use of fat alternatives like fruits and was disappointed at how many recipes in this book relied on reduced fat cheese and cream, etc. I was hoping to avoid the processed foods and various gums and such that replace fats in so many foods."
2,CREEPY,"""I LOVE PARIS"" is clearly the finest song (hence the 2 stars instead of one), but te rest of this anthology is monotonous and meaningless. My gir friend would get upset, but this CD is a downer in more ways than one. I would avoid it. It is really borring and not even worth shoplifing."
1,Truly awful--no stars,I'm so sorry I wasted my money on this CD. It's gone to that big CD trashbin in the sky now.
3,"Annie Lennox shines, although other stars cannot do justice","I love this recording, although I have to admit, it is for one song and one song only. ""Every Time We Say Goodbye"" as rendered by former Eurythmic, Annie Lennox, is soft, sentimental, heart wrenching, and out right beautiful. I have never heard a sweeter raw contralto voice. And the addition of the accordian may seem ridiculous in concept, but the flavor it adds is of a lonely gondola traveling through the canals of Venice or Cambridge, England; very bittersweet. Alas, I find most of the rest of the album offensive. There is a lack of respect for the tradition of jazz music, and often I found the original Cole Porter tunes unrecognizable. Still, I would purchace this CD simply for Ms. Lennox's song. It is a true treasure, and a gift to any collection."
5,Winston read it too,"A great novel, can't believe it's so old it came free on kindle."" Free"" was not the best part, the story was. It covers politics and society and relationships not so long ago. I read something else about Winston Churchill reading this book, in retirement, so I thought ""what the heck."""
3,Didn't Show Up,Never got it. Was told the item was on back order and would likely arrive in 3 weeks and I still have not seen it or heard from the seller. This person/business is a dud.
2,Cheap,My son enjoyed this toy while it was working but it didn't last very long! After about six months it just quit working! Of course I thought it just needed new batteries but that didn't do the trick!
1,Crocodile Piano is a croc!!,"This item was purchased for my son for Christmas. When opened it didn't work, we changed the batteries and still nothing!! Very dissapointing for a two year old that loves making music. Also purchased for Christmas, the Electric Guitar with Mic stand...Also did not work, even after changing batteries. [...]"
1,"35 days since placed order, still not shipped","Hi,I don't say ToysRus is not a big firm, but if you buy thru amazon, be prepared to wait. I've been waiting for 35 days. Christmas has passed, new years has passed, still another 10-15 days for estimated delivery.So be aware.."
1,movie fails miserably where stage play soars!,"This movie was the biggest dissappointment of the early 90's! In an attempt to make it relevant to western viewers, the film makers completely changed the story, the music, and the over-all tone of this important piece of theater. Whoopi, of all people!? Give me a break! She was horrible. And why would you change the most beautiful and powerful South African Township music to sound like African American gospel music? It just didn't work for me at all. If you've only seen the movie version and never had the opportunity to experience Sarafina on stage, you probably won't be able to understand where I'm coming from. Having been blessed with seeing it twice as it toured the country, I can say with out a doubt that the movie version failed miserably where the stage play soared to the highest heights!"
1,Disc does not have all original artists.,"I would hesitate spending one dime for a disc which mixes songs from original artists with covers by imitators. Unfortunately, that is what this is - an unsatisfying, especially for the money, mix."
2,24 fans will watch it just for the heck of it,"24 fans (like myself) will watch Season 6, for better or for worse, just for the heck of it. For newbies, I recommend Seasons 1-3. They remain, the outstanding seasons of the series. Season 7 sounds like it might be better. I hope so, since the word on the street is that there were major rewrites. Looking forward to it."
2,Worst. Season. Ever,"this season sucked. Bad story, bad characters worse execution of how 'immortal' bauer is. Wayne Palmer president?????? Bauer putting up with near death torture, then pulling off a huge escape without so much as limping?Okay it had its pluses (but very few)- the opening sequence, the end and some of the thrilling action sequences. But it generally sucked. Thank god they had the time to plan season seven to make it good.Following the awesome season five, season six just wasn't up to par"
2,Great Series - Worst Season,"This was an incredibly maddening season - it just seemed to go from one preposterous weakness to another. It STARTED with a nuclear explosion on American soil. Where do you go from there? By the middle of the season (12 hours into the story) everyone seems to have forgotten that we had just suffered a nuclear holocaust! The former president is stabbed by his nutty ex-wife and then...nothing! He, his ex and former Secret Service agent Aaron just disappear. This happens to characters throughout the season. All this may be explained by the fact that the writers publicly admitted that they had no bible - no pre-planned story arc. They were making it up as they went along! This is NOT storytelling; it is the video equivalent of a child attempting to convey a story and continually saying ""and then..and then...and then."" This series gets one more chance with me. If it doesn't show me something next season, that's it."
1,very disappointed,Ordered this on Oct 26th and to date still have not received.Tryed emailing seller and received no response. Would not suggest purchasing from this seller
4,item returned not credited,"I received 2 copies of the most recent ""24"" ...I returned one copy via US Mail and have yet to receive a refund. Please check on this for me.Bernard Streeter, 26 Indiana Dr., Nashua NH 03060"
2,A very poor season of a great show,"Season Six revealed the artifice of ""24"" and the show may never recover. The spell may have been broken, through a fragmented plot and unbelievable (even for artifice) developments. I knew there was trouble brewing from the beginning, when Jack recovered from bearded, beaten, and malnourished to quickly give himself a great haircut. In the true ""24,"" the reality of how he got from Point A to Point B would have been the basis for an interesting series of events. Through much of this season, it seemed like an outtake reel of a number of different seasons strung together in hopes it would make sense. It never really did. If Season 7 doesn't recapture the grit of minute-by-minute, excruciating action and tension, the jig may be up for ""24."""
3,24/6,"Season 6 wasn't to 24's usual standards, and the plot lines are getting tired... Jack needs something positive, and fast. While Cromwell is a great actor, does anyone else think it would have been a coup to have tapped Donald Sutherland to play Jack's Dad?"
3,"24 Season 6- Sadly, a disappointing season","Sure, Jack may be back and the first 4 episodes were certainly very entertaining and action-packed, BUT after that it goes downhill with boring subplots, old characters wasted in guest appearances, and recycled and lame storylines. Also, Chloe is pretty much pointless this season and not given much to do, and the story is very unfocused changing villains back and forth every 3 episodes. Certainly had potential with certain story elements i.e.- Assad, the suicide bombings, Audrey's ""death"", and Charles & Martha Logan, but just as things start getting interesting they're thrown away to make room for lame twists. The finale has some slight action, but is still a letdown. Maybe killing off so many good characters in season 5 and having so many bland ones in season 6 really hurt the show. Hopefully the writers will put much more thought and effort into season 7."
3,Not too great...,"As mentioned by the other reviewers, this season of 24 was not too great, nothing compared to seasons prior.@ Mr.Bruno: have you even READ Ayn Rand? How could you even compare the nutjob ultra-""patriots"" with Rand's heroes? Rand was all about people's individual rights - right to life being a key one one of them. The whole strike in ""Atlas Shrugged"" was prompted by the heroes' demand of that right (and by extension - of their right to property). Please, take some time to read the actual books before stating something so ridiculous."
1,why would you sell missing discs!!!,I was so dissappointed when i notice that there were two disc missing from this package. Maybe it was an oversight on my part. but the seller should have put this in big bold letters that they did not have all of the discs to season six!!! Now i have to either return the package ( which is a cost to me) and/or buy another set of season six. Buyers be ware!
2,Just Rent It!,"WHAT A WASTE! It's the same scenerio...thank you Jack for saving the world a-g-a-i-n (moan). It's worth renting, and I wish I would have. The only thing I thought this season would be good for would be some sort of drinking game. One shot every time you hear ""Jack Bauer."" Sigh. Those college days... I'm dissapointed, but what can ya do?"
5,Great Show!,"I really love all of the 24 shows. I have them all with the exception of Season 8, but will be buying that too."
1,i wish they had a negative one star,The book along with the story is a completely unorganized mesh of the same characters suffering from the same dully played out drama of middle life.
2,seymour duncan guide to pickups,I didn't think it was worth the money !I have used his pickups and they are fabulous .......Buy his pickups but skip the DVD !
5,Legal Enviornments and organizational grievances,The expansion of due process in the American work place.
3,Decent story but skip the long flashback,"A sweet young woman asking Holmes' help occupies Holmes' mind and Watson's heart, as they become entangled in tracking mysterious missing jewels.eBook downloaded from Gutenberg. There was a lot to like about this story. Mary is a sensible heroine, not an idiot who walks blindly into danger. The characters are mostly likable and the story moved right along. But Doyle again tacked on a long, tedious flashback under the guise of the villain ""telling his story,"" which I skipped most of. I found it distracting that Watson's supposedly fragile health miraculously improves whenever he needs to chase somewhere with Holmes. Spelling, grammar, and formatting were acceptable, and the title was relevant to the story-behind-the-story."
3,Ya lost me,"Yadda, yadda, yadda - good up until the ridiculous boat scene near the end. This was my first foray into the hailed world of Doyle - and oh, what a disappointing trip. I plan to try again, perhaps with some of his short stories, but I just pray that ""The Sign of Four"" is a not a prime example of Doyle's finer works."
2,Maybe copyrights are not so bad...,"The problem with literature that has been around so long is that any copyrights have expired so virtually anyone can republish it. It's hard to ruin a Sherlock Holmes classic but this book just might do it because it is littered with typos. It really cheapens the experience. Buyer beware, this re-publication is cheap but you get what you pay for."
2,Unreliable,"I purchased this phone in September, it stopped working at the beginning of January and has been sitting in an authorized Panasonic service center waiting for a back-ordered part due to come in at the beginning of February. I called Panasonic - they understood why I was upset but said they couldn't and wouldn't do anything."
3,Meh,"Not the best phone I've ever had, nor the worst, but generally unexciting. It's nice to have the dual handsets because when the main unit is plugged in near my computer the DSL line interferes with reception. This is probably more a DSL issue than a phone one, but it's something to bear in mind.I find the design to be rather counter-intuitive, and am constantly punching the wrong buttons. Reception is fair, tending towards fuzziness, and the unit really isn't comfortable in my hands. Overall, I'd say that while I can live with it, I don't think I'd buy it again."
2,Disappointed,"I have generally used Panasonic phones with good results. This one has a few problems. Most annoying is the phones lose connectivity with the base at least weekly necessitating that I power it down and unplug the phone line. Next, is the volume is to low many times. I use a headset with it and that is another problem. It works fine with my other phones but for some reason I can't use voice when navigating an IVR voice prompt instead having to use the keys to enter data."
3,Not a two-line phone,"I dropped the rating on this apparently fine two-handset telephone system because it came up on a search for ""two-line telephones"" and I ordered it.They're a great deal for the price and are beautiful little phones. At first, rushed glance they seem to be everything I want, but they're not two-line phones. They can support only one line.If you're a one-line home, this system seems to be very worthy of consideration."
5,We love it!,We didn't discover this show until just a couple of weeks ago during the Christmas break. We've ended up renting all the past episodes and getting caught up.
4,HOPE for extras on this SHORT season,"This is the best show on television today. I hope they do a bit better with the extras and commentary that last season's dvd set. Although there is commentary by Baldwin, Fey and Morgan on season one, they are all separate and this leads to some painful, awkward silence by the commentators.Also because of the writer's strike there were only 15 episodes this season as opposed to the usual 22, so I'm hoping there is some time/effort put into the extras.I'm still buying this day one. It is the funniest, smartest comedy on today, and honestly my favorite show in years. Also seeing Tina Fey eat a whole sandwich in one take is worth the $30."
5,"Great show, great Dvd.","Season 2 is a great season, and it only gets better. The characters relationships with each other seem to grow naturally with very little resistance as TGS becomes a key program in NBC's lineup."
3,One of TV's best comedies gets off to a weak start,"I'm going to blame it on Jerry Seinfeld. Well, not him precisely, but I do think that the presence of one of the biggest names ever on TV comedy contributed to making this one of the weakest episodes ever of 30 ROCK. The cast of this show is incredibly fine, but all of them had to be somewhat suppressed to make room for Seinfeld.There are some good moments. My favorite is undoubtedly that Jenna spent her summer doing a stage version of MYSTIC PIZZA, which required her to eat several slices of pizza each evening. The result was that she gains an enormous amount of weight. Subsequent episodes exploit this in wonderful fashion.Established fans of this show will probably find this episode a disappointment. But following episodes have been quite up to last year's high standards. Newcomers to the show should know that despite the presence of Seinfeld, this is not a typical episode. Usually it is one of the sharpest shows on TV."
1,DVD doesn't work,I ordered a copy of this from Amazon and it wouldn't play on any DVD player. Assuming there was an issue with the DVD I returned it and got another. Still doesn't work. Now what?
2,Used to be better in the old days,"I was also not happy with this case, it does not stay closed. My daughter just uses it as a closet for her Barbie dolls. She just props it up and fills it with clothes. I'm not sure if I can say another brand name or not but, the Bratz dolls have a case that is soft, zips closed and has pages for the clothes and accessories with transparent plastic pockets that close with velcro and all the clothes and dolls stay put. I wish the company would make a case like that for Barbie."
2,cool little radio... if you can get receiption.,"I bought this the other day. I can't get receiption at my house anywhere, even outside. I took it over to my mom's house who lives 30 mins away, worked perfect. I took it home, no receiption. The very next day I took it back to my moms, no reeiption.Sirius works perfect in my car, so I guess I'll go buy a car antenna (which costs $35 new) and try and use that instead of the home antenna it comes with and see if that might work."
5,Love it !!!!!!!! 5+ years and still going !,I've had this thing in my office for over five years and haven't had a problem one. Not liking this b/c of signal issues is like not liking a car b/c you ran out of gas.
3,Soul Samples,"Though there were many disappointments, I read the whole book and looked forward to each upcoming page. Dr Sprinkle gave a very personal and close feeling to his work, yet he left the reader CONSTANTLY waiting and wanting more information. I mean, it is all good and well to thank Mr and Mrs so-and-so and refer to their experience, but what do I know of it other than what is in the book and he gives only the briefest of sketches, if any. Also, long whiny battles with institutions and the over use of parentheses do distract from the message (Is there one?) from the book. Lets hope his style improves before his next book because the content of this one is fascinating."
5,over 50,I am over 50 and found the book to make what I thought would be complicated and difficult to be fun and within my physical capability.Great time getting back in shape. Thank you.Tyrone Schiavone
5,Use It Or Lose It,I look forward to exercising about as much as I like eating a bowl of cold mashed potatoes but after buying this book I actually look forwrd to working out with the ball and I feel great afterwards. Perhaps I'm a bit challenged using (how to) books but this is written well enough and has lots of pictures that even I enjoy working out.
2,Wearing Out,"I have now gone through three pairs of Adventerer oversoes. Shortly after one year of wear, all three pairs have failed. Honeywell (who makes them) couldn't care less. They even swore that they did not sell them on their web site overshoe.com! If you go to that sight, you can buy them. All have just flat worn out in different places. The first pair wore out at the uppers stitching, the second at the bottom of the tongue and the third tore at the heel. I only wear them 20-30 minutes at a time, twice a day, four days a week. They certainly should be able to handle that."
3,Vending machine for woodpeckers,"While I agree that the mason bees loved this house, so did the woodpeckers. They had a nice feast on the bees over the winter and now we have a picked apart mason bee house. And no mason bees..."
4,Overall dope album,This album is tough. Vocals and beats are on point. Very professional sounding album. Biggup to Canadian hip-hop. We need to support Canadian indie artists on the come up.
3,this iz bizness,"this was actully a pretty tight album.. i wasnt fealin' it at first but the more i hear the more i like, divo sounds like in time he could be at the top of canadian scene, beats wise i was a little disapointed, some were hot but i dont think they match divos style, he sounds like he can rip a beat but for the most part i thought i was listening to a shawn desmond cd, alot of waterdown imatating going on, the production is generic but divo got a fresh new voice, good thing there is so many tracks on here, divo should look into getting on more live sounding ish, ..i hope divo sticks with it cuz he could be a big name in the upcomming years..."
5,Life - Transforming book!,"This book is literally Life Transforming. When I picked it up to read it I thought it'd be another one of those books with the same old advice, however, this book is DIFFERENT! It is Powerful and Life Transforming. I Highly recommend it to Wives and Husbands. Even if you think your marriage is 100% solid, this book is STILL for you. If you know of anyone who is about to get married this book is Perfect for them."
5,Perfect Fit,I wore this under my wedding dress and it held everything in the right place and did not have to be adjusted once during the entire day and evening. This is the best strapless bra I've ever tried and was amazed that it didn't shift or roll or anything while wearing it!
2,Bra or Harness?,"I do not like this bra - it feels like I am wearing a horse harness, it is so big and bulky."
5,Comfortable support,"After trying many bras, this is the one I have settled on. It supports well and balances my shape. I don't have to worry about the straps slipping and I forget that I am wearing it. The only drawback is that due to the full coverage you have to be careful that it doesn't show with low cut tops or tops that are cut wide in the shoulder area. Amazon had a good price, fortunately, because at full price it is a bit expensive. However, it is well constructed and holds up well to frequent washings. I wear a size 36DD and it is almost impossible to find this size in the stores, so Amazon is the way to go."
2,sizing is not accurate,"The quality of the bra is fine, but I ordered the same size in black as I ordered in the white. The black bra is too tight and the white bra is too loose. I had paid to return them once before to order a size larger and was not going to pay to return them again. I am now stuck with 2 bras and neither of them fit properly."
3,Bra,Doesn't seem true to size. It is a little tight which is unusual. I normally buy this size and have no problem with comfort.
3,Sorry for the low rating,I have purchased this product in the past - hoped they had resolved the problem of the itchy rash causing band at the bottom of the hooks. If the band could be cut up a little higher it may improve this problem.
3,80975 4 in 1 Hacksaw,"Not a light hacksaw, in a age of lighter materials this saw is a heavy weight. The magnets only allows one blade storage. But even with one blade, it does not store it securely. This saw has a lot of moving parts, maybe to many. But the small tension knob under the handle will surely have a short life.But it does have a nice grip. I'll see how it does after a year of everyday use."
1,Do not use this book,"I was asked to review this book for my friend who wished to home school her child. Matter and Motion in God's Universe does not only mislead students on fundamental physical principals, it flat out lies to them about thermodynamic law. As a molecular biologist, I would recommend finding a different book. As a Christian, I would recommend finding a different book. Bottom line: There are other science text books that will work with Christian teachings. Avoid this book at all costs."
3,Graph theory in (good) words.,"This book make you want to know more about graph theory. The concepts are first intuitively explained and then formally stated. The numerous examples are completely treated and then easy to follow. R. Trudeau devoted a large part of the book to the puzzling problems of planar graphs and coloring and explains them in a very pleasant manner. As a result, these problems almost appear as trivial (which of course is not the case).The main criticism I would make is the following. This book is a corrected and enlarged version of another book. Unfortunately, the updating is not very convincing when the ""four color problem"" is a conjecture in the body of the book and a theorem in footnotes and afterwords."
2,Flavor is really hard to get past,The taste is very strong! Doesn't make we want to throw up but makes me not want to use them often! This is my first tine using this type of drop so maybe they all taste bad??????
5,A much needed resource,"Ursula Michelson has provided a much needed resource for all whose lives are profoundly affected by Alzheimer's disease. This clear, straightforward and beautifully written volume is suffused throughout with an indomitable sense of grace and good humor. Her work with patients, their families and caregivers offers an inspired testimony to what is possible to achieve through creativity and an unfailing commitment to honoring every patient's need for compassionate care that reveres the dignity of each unique individual at every stage of the disease. By the age of 65 one in ten will be diagnosed with AD and over the age of 85 over 50 percent of the population will be affected.ANNGWYN ST. JUST Ph.D.Director: Arizona Center for Social Trauma"
5,GREAT VAMPIRE FILM OF THE DECADE,I LOVE FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA AS A DIRECTOR AND HE MADE A OUTSTANDING FILM ABOUT BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA HE'S A SUPERMAN WHEN IT COMES TO FILM I LOVE ALSO THE PERFORMANCE OF GARY OLDMAN IN THIS FILM HE ALSO APPARES IN HARRY POTTER AND HE'S A GREAT ACTOR . PLUS YOU COULD NOT FORGET WYNONA SHE'S EXCELLENT AND SIR ANTHONY HOPKINS AS VAN HELSING AND KEANU REEVES AS JOHNATHAN HARKER THE MOVIE HAS A GREAT CAST SO I JUST DON'T GIVE IT 5 STARS BUT THE WHOLE 100 STARS [GREAT FILM RECOMMENDED] YANELYS
1,The nail in the coffin for Reeves and Ryder.,"In this horribly unessesary gory,graphic and violent film literally sucks. Granted, I watched one hour of it, but one hour was (literally) all I could stomach.I had to take a TUMS after seeing this movie.No kidding. Amongst the most disturbingly graphic and violent scenes is the one in which three vampire women devour a baby. Gary Oldman is interesting as as Count Dracula,but even he can't revive this horrible flop as a film.Keaneu Reeves' acting is a wooden as the stake that went through Dracula's heart. Winona Ryer is horribly miscast. The dialouge is horrible. This is one movie deserves to be buried, never again to arise."
4,It has Tom Waits in it.,I figure that's all you will ever need to know.Here are the lyrics to a Tom Waits song about Dracula:Dracula! Vampire!YEARGHHHHHHHHHHHHDRACULARGHHHHHHHHOH YEAHRGGGG!URGH!*Repeat*That's exactly how it would sound like. I know it.It would sell many copies.
1,"Crap--read the book, people!","This film is so far off the book it can barely be called the same thing, and how they managed to incorporate the author's name in the title is beyond me. Keanu Reeves is laughable trying to mimic a posh British accent, and the high amount of sex thrown in at any slow point (none of which occurs in the story) is enough to put you off entirely. The performances are pablum, and even Anthony Hopkins, who has saved other movies in his time, could not pull this one out of the dung pile for me or anyone I know. All I can say is thank God Coppola did The Godfather, because without that, where would he be with films like this? There are much better Draculas out there, notably the original, silent German film Nosferatu, which actually FOLLOWS THE BOOK, a concept apparently lost on the makers of this film."
5,I realy enjoyed the movie it had some great actors.,"It was based on Bram Stoker's classic book Dracula, about romance and horror. About the evil vampire Dracula. A classic story remade."
2,saw it in the theatre,"I disliked this in 1992, when I didn't know anything about movies, and now that I work in the movie industry, and see it again, I see why I didn't like it; it stinks. Every great director has an embarrassment, this is Coppola's. Bad casting ( Keanu Reeves must be the most mis-cast actor in history ), bad screenplay. 20 minutes into the movie they start throwing gags at you, like rats running upside-down on the ceiling, and shadows that move independently - every 5 minutes, non-stop; no subtlety, no mystery. Production value is good, which keeps it above 1 star, but still very weird, and weird in a way that does not work, lots of clashing, gawdy designs."
3,Not a horror! But a great Erotic Thriller!,"Alright, going into this film, I thought like most people, I would be getting a huge scare from the giant of the B-Movies. However sadly, I was misled, this is an Erotic Thriller, with only a few visuals being remotly classified as frighting and others, well being ""erotic"" if you know what I mean. The make up and dressing where out standing, the feeling that was given was unspeakable. Casting was fairly good, I would never of expected Keanu Reeves to be in this type of film, but you know, you must give him his props for this. Winona Ryder played this role with a feeling that no other actress could match.The film is really a 3 1/2, to bad it could not of been made better, with more of a plot. I would suggest it if you are looking for a Erotic Thriller, but if you are looking for a Horror, look else where.Thanks for reading,Have a Good one...Ryan"
2,"""Bram Stoker's"" Dracula?","While the story does follow the major events of Stoker's novel, it has been rewritten to the point that it is almost unrecognizable. I will admit that visually this film is impressive. The scenery and cinematography are quite good. As for the cast, Anthony Hopkins is a very enjoyable van Helsing, and Gary Oldman does very well as Count Dracula- but not Bram Stoker's vision of the vampire. The other performances are forgettable."
1,No!,"I read the book and loved it. I loved the characters and the plot and the ending. I did NOT enjoy this movie. If you want an accurate film adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel, TURN AWAY!!! This is not the movie you're looking for... This is basically soft, bloody, pornography piggybacking on the title of a great turn of the century piece of art."
2,A poor transfer and low value blu-ray movie,"The cover looks elegant, but the movie is a dull/disappointment. It appears to be a low budget video transfer."
3,not as good as the book,I just read the book also; the film is a watered-down version of the book without the 19th-century style. The book is creepy and suspenseful -- that gets lost in the film. (Probably if it were a close adaptation of the book it would be too long.)
1,Horrible Transfer,I've always liked this film since it was released in theaters but the Blu-ray is one of the worst transfers I have ever seen. It looks like the creators used a very worn work pint of the film for the transfer. I see no difference in the picture quality of the Blu-ray disk and my old VHS copy. None. Very disappointing.
3,Blu-Ray...OK,"I will restrict myself to reviewing this as a Blu-Ray release and not the movie and its content. Many have already commented on the story-line, so I will not belabor the point.Visually...WOW! This movie will not disappoint on those grounds. Very rich textures and colors. One could say, stunning.The sound is not so stunning. It is muddled in quite a few parts making the dialogue almost incomprehensable. Even with my center channel set high, it didn't help.There was one problem...well, two. The movie froze in 2 spots for about 20 to 30 seconds. I checked the disc and there were no visible defects. When I replayed the passages, they played through just fine. So, I am thinking it was my player. This freezing only happened once before on another Blu-Ray and like above, when I replayed the passage, it played fine.If you liked this version of the Dracula tale, at Amazon's current price, it is well worth it."
2,Not even close.,This is the worst dracula movie ever. There is nothing like the classic Dracula movies. I almsot stopped the movie before it ended. The potential was there but quickly turns sour. Bad movie.
1,Bram Stoker's?,"I had just finished reading the book Dracula, and I decided to watch this movie. It was so disappointing. The characters were all there, but most of the movie was not even in the book. I did not at all understand the part about Dracula's obsession with Mina, that did not at all happen in the book. And I guess I must have been the only person who did not feel that the whole blood sucking routine was not at all sexual, what was the point of having women running around topless? (I must have missed that part in the book) I also thought the the character of Mina was terribly written; in the book, I felt that she was one of the most respectable characters, and truly loved her husband, however, in this movie I really hated her, and I don't think the viewer was supposed to.The whole movie in general was overly done, and not that bad, but I would not have a problem with it, just don't call it Bram Stoker's."
5,Dracula is the best!,"I saw this movie many times, and i really loved. This is a great movie, with lot of love and terror, and good actors and actris."
5,Superbit vs. Blu-ray,"If you're looking for a brighter, more detailed picture buy the Superbit DVD. I compared it to the Bluray which I rented. The Blu-ray is MUCH darker and much more creepier which is what you want in a horror movie!!! With the extra darkness comes loss of detail however. The contrast is much better though. I believe Coppola did not approve of the Superbit but did approve the Blu-ray. I prefer the Blu-ray version."
4,"Stoker's Novel, Coppola's Film","I will start off by saying that Bram Stoker's Book DRACULA is amazing. It is easily one of the best books ever written. Coppola's film is NOT Stoker's novel, but it is the closest compared to other Dracula films. It has a good cast, and Gary Oldman is magnificent as the Count. I especially liked Anthony Hopkins' Van Helsing.The film lacked in some areas where other parts are dazzling. This is considered horror, but I can't say it is. It seems more dramatic than horror. The special effects are good (except for the blue flame part) and it has plenty of blood for you sicko fans going for gore. Overrall, good, probably the best adaption of DRACULA to date. But I do wish Coppola just called it ""Dracula"", because putting Bram Stoker's name on it is false advertising."
1,"No, No, NO","This is not ""Bram Stoker's"" Dracula, it is an overdose of pretty costumes and set designs attempting to take the place of plot and drama. In his eagerness to appeal to every sector of the market Coppola's Dracula becomes all things to all people (a villain turning women into undead 'Nosferatu' for no reason, a suffering lover looking for his dead love's re-incarnation, a cobwebbed old man pontificating on history) and since these personae usually conflict, the result is often hilarious. You'll laugh, you'll hurl, you'll cry (if you paid money to rent it, that is.)"
1,CONFUSED,"This movie is cofusing as hell!I had to watch the first 15 minutes about 5 times to actually understand what was going on. I was looking for more of a thrill and I didn't get it with this film. The acting is alright, though I wish they would've picked someone else besides Winona Ryder.Save your money and get Queen of The Damned, or the Vampire Cronicles."
2,"historical inaccuracy, corny nonsense","I am romanian and let me tell you that the beginning of the movie, insofar as it pretends to portray history, is absolutely ridiculous. First, Vlad Dracul is not the same as Vlad Tepes (Vlad the Impaler) who inspired Stoker in writing his novel, he is actually his father ; second,neither Vlad Dracul nor Vlad Tepes ruled in Transylvania but in Muntenia which is the southern region of Romania. now, I don't know who's the guy talkin' in romanian for Vlad (I heard it was Lux Interior from the Cramps) but I as a native speaker could hardly understand anything.Keanu Reeves sucks.Tom Waits rules.Anthony Hopkins get carried away.Winona Ryder is ok.Gary Oldman is lame.so except for Tom Waits's performance (...), this movie is a waste of time and an insult to romanian history.watch Nosferatu the Vampyre instead"
2,Should Remove Bram Stoker's Name From The Title!,"By the title, I expected a straight forward adaptation of Bram Stoker's original all-time classic. But don't be fooled as I was; this tragic piece of sex-and-gore falls flat in the end, and exploits Bram Stoker's good name.The acting by Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder are very good, actually, but Keanu Reeves' performance as Johnathon Harker is one of his all-time worst. Anthony Hopkins is the only relief, who seems to be having a blast as the eccentric scientist/vampire killer Abraham Van Helsing, and is very entertaining to watch.There's just too much emphasis on sex and cool photograpgy, rather than spending time trying to scare you; it's NOT SCARY!You wanna see good Dracula? Then go see the 1958 Hammer verion (it's great!), or even the Mel Brooks spoof of it! Anything's better than waisting your time with this poor excuse for a horror film!"
2,What the heck?,"Why all the praise. Interview With The Vampire is scarier and much more gorgeous. There is no bad acting like Mr. Reaves. This film was cheesy and cheap looking. Winona is spectaculer and so are some other roles. It is also boring. It does have some wonderful cinematogrophy but, it pales in comparison to Interview."
2,Great while it lasted,This whisk had a great feel in your hand. It worked great for about 1 year then it exploded into a bird nest of wire. Not to good for the occasional home use (maybe 15-20 times.)
5,Great for smooth coat dogs!,"I used this on my smooth coat dalmation. She sheds, but no brush can really get the dead hair off of her. This can! I was surprised at how much dead hair came off, and she didn't mind it at all!If you have a smooth coat/short haired dog and you want them to stop shedding - get this comb!"
4,What a trip,Lavender Cowboy alone is worth the price of the CD. What a trip into the time before political correctness.
5,"Author of ""Live in the Moment"" wishes every HS Grad would receive this book!","I read about this book in the newspaper and ordered it right away, even though I already get it when it comes to ""wishing we knew then what we know now"". I wrote my book for the same reason - if only I'd had a book like ""Live in the Moment"" or ""What I Know Now"" to read as I entered into the adult world. Learning things that other people wish they'd known at a younger age only helps to reaffirm my belief that it's up to us to help open the eyes of the next generation. They've got the world by the tail, if only they would realize that and make the most of it! Brava Ellyn Spragins."
3,What I Know Now,"Older women, from various walks of life, pen letters to their younger selves. Most of the advice was things that the older generation usually tells the younger generation - take time to enjoy life, practice patience, listen, make smart choices, and to remember your self-worth. It was a quick read and could be inspiring to some. It would probably make a great gift for an older woman who likes to read."
1,Boring,Nothing new here. Huge disappointment. Letters are all clichéd generalizations. Sure wish I had my money back.
1,Technical women are missing,"What a shame. Only one woman (McKellar) representing *any* of the STEM professions between this book and the ""women in their 20's"" version. The books include a little bio with each letter, so the lack of technical role models is very telling."
3,Order was never received,I waited several weeks and my book did not show up in the mail. I emailed the seller and got a quick response. My book got lost in the mail and unfortunately they did not have a replacement so i did not get my purchase.
1,Saxon Algebra 1 Solutions Manual,"The Solutions Manual offered through Amazon is for the 2d edition, not the 3rd, which has been out since 1997. Since no edition is mentioned in the write-up, I ordered it. Once received, I discovered that it was of no value to me in checking my son's homework. Now I've lost 4 - 6 more weeks of time while I wait for the Saxon Publishing cite to mail the current manual to me. In the meantime, I'm personally working 60 algebra problems nightly for my kids (30 for algebra 1 and 30 for algebra 2). It was a true disappointment. Be careful which edition you require."
2,Poor quality compared to recent Japanese remasters,"Love the music, but this particular release is poorly mastered for CD. Do yourself a favor, and pay more for the Japanese 24 bit remastered versions released this past Fall '03. Not only is the sound quality far superior, but it is packaged in a replica mini-Lp, complete with insert booklet. I purchased just the first three (Wives/Centre/MythsLegends), but practically, if not all, of the A&M catalog was re-released with 24bit remastering in Japan. Why Universal record company in the US can't get their act together and release these here is beyond understanding. Too busy prosecuting kids who download, I suppose."
3,REMASTER THIS CD! PLEASE!!!,"JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH is an amazing musical journey that mere words cannot describe. RICK WAKEMAN is awesome. The London Symphony Orchestra is awesome. Five stars all the way for the music. The sound quality of this CD is weak though, and lowers my overall rating of the CD. A&M records needs to remaster this disc to improve the sound quality and while they're at it - include a full color booklet depicting all the original artwork from the album. That is when I'll want to plunk down my hard earned jack for this recording."
2,Needs remastering BADLY!,"For some of us this piece carries the sentiment of years gone by and moments cherised with others. it is melodically inspired and beautifully orchestyrated.So, with 50 plus reviews behind me I will just add two stars to the mix due to something already mentioned: the sound! This is a major orchestral piece, not a loud rock outing, therefore, without even hearing the quoted Japanese remastering, it is quite obvious this needs one badly.When that happens, I'll buy it (alas, again!)"
3,Not as good as I remember,"Got to admit, this CD was a disappointment. It's not as good as I remember, sure the music is the same, but the production value is poor.I would have liked a much cleaner version of this classic."
4,"Fun,Fun,Fun","My 4 year old daughter absolutely loves this toy. She can do this all by herself (""growing"" and ""styling"" her hair).The only drawback is that sometimes the Playdoh can be hard to get out of the pony when it's time for clean up."
2,Messy!,This toy was just a huge mess. It did not work like it was supposed to. I was very disappointed with this product.
2,Doesnt live up to the hype for everyone,"I have made a return to the gym and picked up body building again after a 10 year absence. I took my time and after 2 years back into it, my strength has come back but I have had serious shoulder joint pain. My chiropractor suggested this product and I have been taking 2 - 3 tablets a day along with 3,000 mg of fish oil and the pain is still there. The best relief I can get is from over the counter ""naproxen sodium"" which is dirt cheap. I'm not saying this product won't do miracles; it just didn't do any for me."
3,Not Great.. but readable,"The 3rd installment in the Kydd series following on from `Kydd' and `Artemis'. This was the book that I really expected to see a little more character development in Kydd. Unfortunately, the book fails in many ways, not just with the lack of Kydd's character. The worst area is in regards to the plot. Time and again we find the author building up a dangerous situation, i.e a sail in the distance.. only to turn the page and find that the crew has defeated the enemy and all is well. It seems to read like a collection of 20 short stories all with quick endings. The only exception to this trait is the final story.The worst book of the series so far, but still ok to read and a must if you want to continue reading the series."
4,Au Revoir les enfants: Review,I am satisfied by the product and I have to congratulate the ex-owner for her honesty. Thank you.P. L. ANDRE
1,A misguiding title by a Drake Technologies zealot.,"Although the title of the book may imply that it could be of use as a study guide, its main focus is to self promote the general acceptance of the A+ certification process. Clearly the bulk and the focus of this book is on why you should make Drake Technologies and Testing richer. The information is weak and is really of no use to anyone who is close enough technically, to need additional study material."
4,Nice family show,Great for younger watchers and not to bad for adults who are still young at heart. I hope they make another show like this.
3,Not much like the first Nanny McPhee,"Well, this was just okay. It's a fun little romp, but without the excellent character development of the first. This is more like left-over special effects meet KungFu Panda."
5,Nanny McPhee Returnes,Loved Asa Butterfield in the movie and the whole cast Nanny McPhee Returnes great family film Asa Butterfield in Hugo is also fantastic
5,Really good movie,Quite endearing and just as good as the first installment. Emma Thompson is great & I also really liked the new 'winged' character.
2,Mixed Review,"The Story was very good, the actors were good, but the picture size wouldn't fill the screen. On a HD TV, it was letter boxed, even with zoom function it didn't fill the vertical width of the screen. Watching on my computer 16 X 9 monitor screen, it left large gaps between the top and bottom of the Monitor screen, when zoomed to full screen."
3,Felt different than the first.....,"This one didn't have the ""atmosphere"" that the first one did. Didn't seem to go as deep. I enjoyed the very beginning and the end, with a few giggles in between. My 7 and 9 year old liked it, but would rather watch the first one again."
3,"Not great, but not that bad","The book could have been edited down by about a hundred pages, but I found it a quick read. While I wouldn't highly recommend it, neither would I say it was awful."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"Coffman is one of those ""uneven"" authors - her books are either terrific and engaging or disappointing. This book falls in the latter category. The characters are shallow and the story is difficult to care about.I used to buy all her books, then I became more selective. I wish I had passed on this one."
2,Drying and irritating for me,"I've used many benzoyl peroxide products in the past, and never had any issues. I think Clean and Clear discontinued my favorite benzoyl peroxide wash, so I tried this one. My face felt dry and tight, but didn't react too badly. It was a bit too harsh for daily use, so I had a milder cleanser for every other day.The real issue is that, for the first time in my life, my hands broke out in terrible eczema. I've never had eczema before, and after ruling out many other products, conditions, etc...I found out this was the culprit. At first I discontinued use, but I had so much (2 bottles) that I didn't want to waste it. After the eczema healed and a month or so went by, I tried adding just a dab of this into a much milder cleanser. It still made my hands painfully dry, so I can't really get any use out of this.Everyone's skin is different, but something about this cleanser HATES my hands. Avoid if you have sensitive skin."
1,Not so great!,"Suppose one can't expect much for the price, however:The CD cover is so hard to puch down (and makes a terrible sound) one thinks the plastic will shatter! The volume would not suffice for the hard of hearing or those who want to ""rock on!"" Heavy with batteries - that don't last more than a few plays of CDs. Continue your search for a quality product - this isn't it!"
2,had to return,"I absolutely loved the radio. It was everything I wanted in a radio. Perfect. Except the first night, I was going to sleep and it was beside my bed. I could hear a humming noise. Couldn't figure out what it was. Put my ear to the radio and that is where the noise was coming from. And the bottom vent on the radio was quite hot. I unplugged it and sent it in to Emerson the next day, as it did it every time I plugged it in. I am hoping for a quick return from them and a radio I will be completely happy with. I will write another review when I get my radio back."
4,Gangbusters,A compact little drama with some nice twists... the kind of movie I loved watching on late night TV as a kid. But don't expect too much -- the situation of the film feels very theatrical and Ginger Rogers (sporting a disfiguring short haircut and one tight polka-dot dress) socks her performance home a little too hard. Edward G. Robinson is competent but has little to work with; Brian Keith comes off best. Not bad... just lower your expectations.
4,"Sensible, useful brief study","This short book is based on lectures given by the author. While some of the scholarship and language is a little old-fashioned and some of Wiley's ideas have been questioned by more modern scholars such as McPherson, it remains useful. Wiley presents a refreshingly rational and balanced account of Southern daily life. The material on soldier life is a briefer version of his seminal work ""The Life of Johnny Reb"". This isn't a highly detailed study, but it will be a helpful and readable text for anyone wanting to improve their general knowledge of the subject."
4,Closer to reality,"Sad but true. this film blew me away. It had the haunting ""close""ness that movies like Open Water give. You're there, feeling every needle point. i literally cringed at the lies and deception, but most significantly i almost looked away at the ""crawling back"" of Jud Law's character, matched with Julia's. this film was unique in it's reflection of all things wrong with love."
3,"Good, Good, But","The story is good, the cast is great but the movie seems to lose focus a couple of times as if the director did not know how to move to the next step...overall a good movie to watch"
1,Terrible,"Thank god I only checked it out from the library. This is one of those movies that you could just stop watching halfway through and not care one bit what happens or how it ends. Why? Because the characters are not interesting. There's no hope or rooting for any of them. Also, Natalie Portman cannot act. It's almost painful watching her deliver her lines. Skip this movie."
1,Hide the Sharp Instruments,"This movie plays like a bad parody of an Ingmar Bergman film. People fall in desperate love after five minutes of inane conversation. Jude Law is terrific in his first scenes as an obituary writer who gets a crush on Natalie Portman's character after an auto/pedestrian accident. But the next time we see him, he seems to be playing someone else entirely. Julia Roberts is flat as the photographer who falls for Jude-the- jerk. Portman is serviceable as the waif who drifts through the lives of the other three. As many have noted, Clive Owen steals the movie. He brings badly-needed energy and edginess to every scene. I really can't imagine anyone caring what happens to these four sad sacks (except, possibly, Owen). This is one of those films that critics love, and the people who have to pay for their tickets loathe. And I still have no idea what the title means. If this is ""Closer,"" then I'll be happy to keep my distance."
1,Closer,"I didn't like the movie at all. But after reading some of the review's I noticed everyone was confused on how someone could be cheated on, dumped, lied to, and still take that person back. Then leave them over a question. But if he really loved her unconditionally then the question would have never been asked. The answer would always bother him or he wouldn't need to know it. How can she believe his love is authentic, exspecially if he already knew the answer."
1,Disturbing yes . . Good movie no!,"This is honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It has a great cast that should be able to instill something about the characters that you actually like, but there is absolutely nothing to like about anyone in the film. It is disturbing because these people are so horrible to one another you can't believe you are sitting there listening to this filth come out of their mouths directed at someone they supposedly care about. This is not entertainment nor does it shed any light on the human condition it is just ugly people being ugly to one another."
3,"""I don't eat children either."" - ""Alice""","Natalie Portman hasn't had an appropriate leading man since Jean Reno in The Professional. This movie made me especially miss their pairing. She seems too much for the people in this film, beyond their capacity to comprehend. I think everyone is lying in this movie and no, Alice does not love Crocodile. She just doesn't look like she belongs with any of these people and London looks empty and uncomfortable. The best thing about this movie is the line that she delivers early in the movie that she doesn't ""eat children either."" and the second best thing about this movie is the sofas."
2,Closer to junk.,"This movie gets 2 stars and not 1, only because of Julia Roberts, and because a small part of the dialogue is funny and entertaining. Nothing else worse mentioning other than 2 couples hurting each other on your TV screen for 2 hours for almost no reason at all while using all kind of bad language.Weak characters, weak story, weak acting, bad scenery, nice music, good quality DVD; In other words, save your dollars."
3,"Talented Cast, But Shallow Story","Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen are all brilliant actors and Mike Nichols almost always directs films that last forever in their emotional depth. (Check out his resume). Patrick Marber wrote the original stage play and it almost makes me want to seek it out in its truest form, as this film brought out nothing in me other than cynicism and dismay. In fact, the main emotional themes seem to be neurotic passion, heartbreak, sadness, anger, evil vengeance, pathetic pleading, deception, and honesty to the point of brutality. Some may find this an interesting exploration of emotions mixed with complex personalities in confusing circumstances. Some call this entertainment, but I think all involved could have done much better. This is a very personal film and one that can only be interpreted by the viewer. I found it very, very bleak."
1,"Artsy or not, this film is weak","I am a huge Natalie Portman fan and I decided to give this flick a try, boy was I disappointed!I understand that they are trying to be ""artsy"" in this film, but it just wasn't enjoyable to watch. I just didn't care about any of the characters in this movie. They are self absorbed cold hearted characters. Jude Law's character was just pathetic! He is wimpering and whining throughout the whole movie. I was screaming at the screen ""Get a backbone you wimp!"""
1,"FILTHY RUBBISH ""FILM-MAKING""","This is what debased minded actors do when they have far too much financial wealth and recognition. Should this have been the first film they ever made, they would have never been asked to act in anything ever again. Shame on them using such filthy writing in chat-rooms and filthy talking amonsgt themselves. In my opinion, the writers and directors are reprobate perverts in every way, who most likely need meds to sleep at night and who live deformed lives in the day, lives which must be driven by every demon in hell having a ball polluting them. I am disgusted that these actors egos made them graduate to such low levels, right into the gutter and cesspool of utter shame and perversion.I refused to watch this trash until the end. It is outright immoral, disrespectful and ammoral. All of them are contributors of turning the world into the mess it's in. I don't care if it was made 10 yrs ago! DON'T SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS!"
3,Like watching a train wreck,"Three out of the four people are really unlikable. Alice (Jane) is the most fragile and likable and the one who comes out in one piece.The others are truly sick people (well Anna is more normal than the rest although not by much). No one sticks with their partner very long (except poor Alice/Jane).Appalling is a better word for this movie; however, I was unable to look away and I think this movie will stick with me for a long time. I came away with my own thoughts on relationships: difficult, bitter, demanding and ugly at times. What a depressing afterthought after watching a movie.It's worth watching if you don't mind vulgar and very sexual situations. If those offend you, don't watch. No way of skipping past them."
1,can you say horrible....,"The only reason I sat through the whole thing was because I had nothing better to do, and I kept thinking ""it HAS to get better... it can't be this bad all the way through and have such a good actor base to it""!!! but alas, I was wrong. The plot was HORRIBLE... the acting was HORRIBLE... the content was HORRIBLE- are you beginning to see a HORRIBLE pattern?? after it was over, I sat back and asked myself what the point was to the movie... I couldn't come up with one. It should come with a warning to viewers about the innappropriate content- above and beyond the R- rating. It was a very disappointing movie overall- Please SAVE YOURSELF!!!"
3,It was ok.,"Not the movie that I thought it was going to be. It was ok....nothing to write home about. If there is nothing better to do on a rainy day, consider watching it."
2,what the hay!?,ordered this movie on blu ray new and when i got it the disc was new but the case had been warped from heat damage and looked obviously recycled. kinda a big deal considering it was advertised as new. i wouldn't recommend this seller. if your going to reuse a case or disc then you better have the decency to give me one in great condition and not warped and wrinkled. i would not recommend this seller nor use them again. i was excited to get this and was disappointed at the results. what a bummer.
3,Could have been great,"When you get actors of this caliber, it is pretty difficult for it not to be interesting. Interesting it is, however, why put them in a movie that shows no progression. None of the main characters changes for the better by the end of the movie. Alice shows some growth in trying to tell the truth but there is nothing to indicate that she is a changed woman. So what is the point?As a play it makes perfect sense to raise the idea and discussion of how people that have no sense of themselves act when in a relationship. Even those that have a sense of self misguided as they are ( Clive Owen) can be fun to watch but usually there is a character around this self-absorption that sees a light at the end of the tunnel. Well do not look for it here. No one learns anything, and we are lead to believe that no one would do anything different in another situation.Disappointing movie, that should have been one to shine."
1,Closer,I can't believe I wasted one of my three-DVDs-a-week on this mess. What was Julia Roberts thinking?
3,To be remembered as Natalie Portman's first adult role,"Twenty years from now, the only reason 'Closer' will be remembered is because it represents Natalie Portman's first 'adult' role. The Golden Globes got it right: she and Clive Owen dominate the proceedings here, lording over supposed leading lights Julia Roberts and Jude Law. With Owen, it's even more impressive when you consider that he played Law's character in the original London play.Under Mike Nichols' direction, 'Closer' is about as close a thing to a play on screen as you're ever going to see. Only six characters are credited, and in fact characters five (taxi driver) and six (secretary) have one line apiece.I do have to credit Nichols for a wonderfully imagined beginning - the scene of Law and Portman eyeing each other on the street for the first time (in super slo-mo) with Damien Rice's ""Blower's Daughter"" essentially narrating the scene is an unsurpassed cinematic moment."
3,Quite unique...but with a bit of dragging..,"I found this movie to be quite unique. Serial infidelity and deception take course as two of the main characters feed onto their lust for one another without giving the ones they truly love a second thought. Although the movie drags on a bit, it has an important message: true love shouldn't be taken for granted."
4,Clive looking good,"A really good pick if you want a slew of good actors and especially Clive Owen. Interesting, kept me from falling asleep, a problem I have now that I have a yound child at home, ha! had some nice dreams after this too, what a plus."
2,not believable,"this movie is ok...don't get me wrong. but after watching it all i could think was 'wow...i didn't find any of the dialogue between the characters interesting or realistic.' they're all good actors, but there's too much useless drama dribble in this movie to make it worth the money you paid to watch it."
3,"I love you, i need to piss","A film about annoying, selfish and jealous people. Just like real life, accept more articulate. The film jumps months and years aheadseamlessly, so the veiwer can feel clever for followng the story. A film for people who think they are sophisticated."
1,The Most Pretentious Movie Ever Made,"This is the most PRETENTIOUS movie that i have ever seen. I didn't believe any of the characters even for a second. Seriously, nobody talks like that or act like that in real life. Because it had won so many awards, I expected better. Don't watch it. It is a total waste of money. I much prefer British mini series made in the 70's (for example, Upstairs Downstairs)."
2,Nothing to do with reality.,"This movie is a sensationalized representation of all that can go wrong in a relationship. The problem with this film is that is is too self indulgent and exclusionary to the point that only disturbed people could relate to. The script was formulaic to the point of absurdity. I guess people call this an "" artsy "" and "" intelligent "" film but sad to say it is neither. One thing it is however is a waste of time. I think the most foolish scene was between Natalie and Clive in the private loung of a stripper pub. This scene simply didn't need to be there but for sake of making a few bucks at the box office they though it wise to get Natalie to undress and shake her back end a few times. The only problem with that motivation is the Natalie really isn't that hot to begin with. She is just average looking at best, short with big legs if i am being honest. The only good thing about the movie was the music."
3,Cordless Phone,"The volume on the mic on these phones is really LOW...when you call this person you can BARELY hear them on the other end of the line...I don't know if there's a control for this on the phone, but if so I couldn't find one...If there is any issue with this I wouldn't go with this model!"
3,OK READ MOSTLY MOTIVATIONAL,"First of all, this is a book intended to be motivational and for the beginning investor. It is told in story format like the book ""The Wealthy Barber."" Another comment on the book mentions that there is little actual advise included that you can actually act on other than you need to do something and educate yourself. If you haven't yet gotten THAT message, then this book might warm you up to the task.But if you are a beginner, it is my opinion that any book on the subject of personal financial management IS worthwhile; you never know what might give you the push you need to get started. And, if that is the case, in addition to this book, I would recommend ""The Wealthy Barber,"" (if you care for the narrative style), ""The Millionaire Next Door,"" and ""Start Late, Finish Rich."" Of those four, this book (Rich Woman) would be rate last on the list.W. R. CurielAuthor,The Debt Whisperer"
5,Kim's Book is a great read for men as well as women,"I bought two of Kim's book, one for my partner and one for a potential future daughter-in-law (who has better business sense than my son does at this point). I read the one I bought for my partner and found it a great read, even though it was directed to women."
1,Disappointed,"It's all ""conversations"". I wish I could learn something from it. I love reading, but all I have in conclusion for this book is tedious, waste of time and money. There are bunch of great books about investment and especially for women. Rich Woman is not the one."
1,Stupid Book,"Sorry, really disliked it. Like the Rich Dad books and the Rich Dad game, Cashflow. Sorry, this book is terrible."
5,Nifty device,"It was recommended by a music teacher. I played trumpet waaaayyyy back in junior high school almost 34 years ago. Buzzing helps you build your embouchure, and you could also practice fingering when attached to your trumpet. By attaching it you feel less silly about making buzzing sounds and not music. It's worth the price, and of course Amazon had it for the lowest price around."
4,"Unsparing, ambitious, funny but also bitter and obsessive.","Roth's considerable abilities are clearly in evidence here: narrative force; powerful intelligence; an unblinking examination of the human heart and mind; an unsparing honesty. But so too are his weaknesses: a truly obsessive concern with men-women relations; an unmistakably bitter tone when he speaks about women; a story that in the end succumbs to its obsessions and anger rather than transcends them, or even finds a feasible accomodation. The endless, fruitless, explorations of the protagonist's pysche finally become too much for the reader; the work begs to be shortened. Still,there are many fine, perceptive (and funny) moments in this book. Roth, even not at his very best, demands reading and consideration."
1,biggest rip off ever,"I thought this was a much bigger box, as I didn't have my old box around to check quantity. Boy was this expensive. I can get the bigger box for like $11 at my local bodegaThis was the most expensive litter I have every bought. Buyer beware!!!!"
1,Horrible Smell! Never again!,"We bought this litter for two new cats we adopted. It was on sale so we thought we would give it a go. I had always used another brand in the past with my cat who recently passed away so I thought trying a new kind would be no big deal at all. As soon as we started using it, the smell was almost unbearable. The cats would not even go near the litter box and the smell of this litter was making us sick to our stomach. I seriously thought there was something wrong with the litter. Possibley a bad batch? But I went back to the store and smelled another box, and it was the same. Never again. I changed back to my old brand and all is normal and the Cat's are happier than ever. I do not recomment this product at all."
1,Worst Smell Ever,I purchased this brand at a local store. I will never buy it again.It didn't clump and the residual smell of the clean litter was horrible. Muddy and weird smelling. Here I am thinking that the Arm and Hammer name would make a great litter that had baking soda in with it. They came up with it but it's not good.The smell is sort of like a mildewy wet litter/powder smell.I'm sticking with Scoop Away.
1,Terrible !!!,"Arm & Hammer Super Scoop Clumping Cat Litter Is The WORST!!! It does'nt clump it seems to hold moisture & stinks to high heaven. It also has scented perfume in it , combine that with the lovely smell of cat feces stuck to the rack of my litter maid and you get the picture!! Don't waste your money . Arm & hammer really has nerve to sell this garbage as clumping cat litter."
2,Does not help with ODOR!,"I thought A&H; would have the best cat liter to fight off unwanted scents. WRONG!! lol. I usually buy Fresh Step but A&H; was on sale so I bought it. The scent of the litter stinks, and as soon as I walk in the house It smell like poopy yuck!I NEVER had this problem with Fresh Step NEVER! I'm going back to what works. I only have one back and his litter box should not smell like I have 4 cats."
5,Cat Litter,"Of all the cat litters that I have used, this is one of my favorites. I always add baking soda in all the cat litters I have tried, but this seems to keep the smell to a minimum. My husband has a VERY sensitive nose to this type of smell, so to keep the peace, I do what I can."
4,Pretty good..,"I just got this game for christmas, and I loved it.But, this game was much to easy.After three days I beat the game already, but other than that it's a really good game.Oh and there is some spelling mistakes in the game also.."
1,What the hell happened???????????????//,"Wow,im really starting to hate Bandai making some of the greatest shows turn into one of the slowest RPG's of the year.i don't get it,how come the DBZ graghics are perfect in bodokai 3,but they make Inuyasha a super-deformed graphic style that could please toddlers only.Bandai if your reading this, Inusha:feudal combat better be good..."
1,Boring!,"I like the show, I like anime. This game is lame! No one can die. You can play the whole game with virtually one button. Rated T for teen? Bull****. Boring!"
2,Good and Bad,"Purchasing it from Amazon was great. The game came on time and was in perfect shape. The problem with this game is that it is only about 30 hours of gameplay. As a person who plays video games alot, I finished it in less than a week. Also, the graphics on the game left much to be desired. It was like I was playing one of my Gamecube games rather that Playstation. Truthfully they could have done much better."
1,I am not satisfied,"I bought this book and found something completely different from what I ordered . I contacted the seller and told him that this book is different from what I expected, they suggested on me to return the book back. I did and unfortunately I have not received my money back until this moment."
3,Worth the first 20 minutes...,Past the opening few gun fights this movie just loses direction. It had promise and then slips away and becomes a tired man vs. machine type plot. The first 20 mintues or so really reminded me of the roleplaying game Cyberpunk by R.Talisorian.
2,"Loaded With Action, Empty Shells Of Storyline","Robots are trying to take over man kind to turn man into robots, marking the end of man kind. A cop half man half machine finds his humanity and protects the humans and fights against the machines. Sounds like a interesting premise for a movie, for a low budget movie its loaded with action and some decent special effects towards the end of the film. Problem with the rest of the movie is the storyline drags on, theres not much charector development as they are not interesting, the acting isn't good, the pacing at the times is slow and the dialogue is just filler with no substance. Its fun to watch the action scenes and the robot at the end but thats about it."
4,B-MOVIE LOVERS DELIGHT,"This is one of those sci-fi movies that is so bad you'll fall in love with it; (Blade Runner is deeply maligned when this film is compared to it.) Sometimes on your days off from work you just wanna see a good shoot'em up movie with lots of Cyborg bad-guys and slapstick dialogue and beefcake/cheesecake heroes. If you're looking for approximately 90 minutes of pure escapist trashy fun, here's your answer."
2,Ultratrak Analog Pedometer,"Purchased this product at a premiun price compared to digital pedometers because of favorable experience in the past with this type of pedometer. The only reason I discontinued using them was a tendency of the strap to break due to insufficient clearance with the pedometer body. Otherwise they were simple to use and reasonably accurate. They also did not lose performance over time that occurs with loss of power in the battery operated digital pedometers.The current version was a total disappointment. The first one did not work--failed to register, and its replacement was no better. There was no way to determine if both were defective or were designed for some application other than walking. Both have been returned for refund and will be replaced by a digital pedometer."
5,The redemption,"Domenico is the key , he's a man who lives (out of reality?) ; but his speech given in the apex sequence is the fundamental nucleus of this monumental work.Tarkovsky had to leave his birthplace , after making Stalker , and this fact (as the Nuremberg judgement in Fürtwangler case) obviously will affect deeply this film maker. Tarkovsky decided to establish himself in Italy ; and the first work will be that one; loaded of Nosthalgia ; notice that Tarkovsky always insisted in the importance given to this word ; in the russian mood Nosthlagia would have similarities with a brasilian word saudade but with major landscape.The concerns this film deals about are a real tour de force for all the viewers ; the reflectins about the human condition , the abscence of center in our way of living , will let you in shock state and you'll be watch it over and over because the powerful ideas are endless in their meanings and deepness.An artistic masterpiece of this cosmical director.!"
4,Review of Nostalghia,"I enjoyed the plot of the movie. However, some of the character development borders on the pyschotic. Good movie in the old country."
3,Just An OK Howard Hawks Film,"Hawks assembled a great cast for this aviation movie, but for some reason it left me cold...........I never could believe that Cary Grant was this barnstorming, cold hearted pilot....maybe that is just me. Grant of course was magnificent in the previous year's Bringing Up Baby where he and Hawks teamed up for one of the greatest comedies ever. Hitchcock had a better sense of Grant's strengths and could use Grant in ""serious"" roles where his penchant for comedy was utilized................Grant in this movie is humourless.The best performance in the movie was Thomas Mitchell's Kid.... .......what an actor! In 1939 he appeared in the following 5 movies: Gone With The Wind, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Mr Smith Goes to Washington, Only Angels Have Wings, and Stagecoach where he won an Oscar for playing Doc Boone.............lol what a year!This movie is worth a view, but Hawks made many more movies far better than this."
2,Have to take this movie down a peg,"I'm glad so many people enjoyed this movie, but I can't really rave about it as a classic as everyone else. The beginning is quite slow and vague. The cinematography is very dull and most of the movie feels like a stage play inside the same 2-3 rooms. A lot of the story is rather dramatic and contrived about the list of enemies and old flames that arrive. There were several compelling moments, but a lot of it is based around bravado and a bit of chauvinism. Not really memorable lines or scenes. I like Cary Grant... but thumbs down."
3,Be warned! Needs a lot of work!,"This violin looks nice, but it required more money to get adequate sound out of it. First of all, the finger board is plastic, not wood as the description says. The bridge that comes with the violin is too high, putting undue tension on the strings. I was fortunate enough to have a good instrument repair shop near me. They replaced the finger board and custom made a bridge to fit the violin.Additionally, as other reviewers have indicated, the bow is too soft and I had to replace all the strings and add fine tuners to the three that didn't have them. The built in amplifier serves it's purpose, however, if you looking for a sound that's more rock than classical, you're going to need to purchase an amp.After the repairs, I'm very happy with my purchase. I just wanted to give fair warning to anyone else thinking about buying this violin."
4,This Movie Is Hilarious!,"I like the Police Academy movies and this is definitely one of the best movies in the series and Bubba Smith, David Graf, Steve Guttenberg and the rest of the cast are hilariously funny and I highly recommend this movie!"
5,Magrudergrind the way grind should be,"Magrudergrinds ""power-violence"" grind is wicked. Played the way it should be "" Rehashed "" is classic grindcore primative, basic but powerfull and relentless a must have for fans of Phobia, Insect Warefare, Regurgitate ect."
5,Cranberries,"Cranberries are sweet and delicious! Very fresh! Tightly packaged! Very quick delivery! Second time buying from this vendor, will definitely be back! Great price, too!"
3,Very sweet.,These seem very sweet to me. Not the best I have ever had.They would be a whole lot better if they were not as sweet.
2,Disappointed,"I bought these based on all the great reviews here. Maybe I just got a bad box, but mine were nothing like those described in all these other reviews! The cranberries were dry and tough. They were encrusted with sugar and sticky. Not very flavorful, and slightly stale tasting.Before trying these I had bought the Oskri brand on a lightning deal, and they were great. Plump and flavorful. But expensive, so I tried these. No comparison at all! I'm going to toss these in the trash and go back to Oskri."
2,Infomation Useless,"Unless you care to know about the history. There's not enough information or detail. Other books likeBasics of Game Designby Michael E. Moore,The Ultimate Guide to Video Game Writing and Designby Flint Dille and John Zuur Platten has more indepth on characters. Sure there's no pretty pictures of characters, but game guides or art books have them(plenty of them). Example:Art of the Mass Effect Universegives you the pictures of characters and their examples/concepts the process that they went through to get what they wanted.In other words, if you have money to spare and/or would like to know history, otherwise choose wisely on what you are looking for exactly, weather it be concepts(pictures) or descriptions. My opinion: Money well wasted."
5,Great product,"I'm very excited to write this review..I build models..This model was fun and exciting to build..A great way to learn,Fun for all ages..Very Very detailed when completed..Dont heasitae to buy this product..You will have fun,And you will enjoyThis product,,Arrived on time..Great price also...Model builder Ford.."
5,great book,"I really loved this book. I just suggest you read Anna and the Duke first because if you read it second (like I did), it kind of messes things up becuase you know what's going to happen. Emily has gone through alot including the death of her father, the appearance of a brother, Ewan, she never knew she had, her other brother, Richard, going practically insane and trying to get rid of Ewan, and a man proposing to her on a wager. So she decides not to stay in London and goes to stay with Ewan and his wife Anna (see what I mean about reading Anna and the Duke first?) in the land she has always wanted to see: Scotland. There she meets Ewan's cousin Jamie who is very unlike his cousin. There are a lot of mishaps and you can guess what happens."
3,"A classic , but I dont think everything will love it","I wasn't into it as much as I thought. It sort of reminded me of All in the Family with Broderick Crawford playing a male chauvinist pig ala Archie Bunker and Judy Holiday acting like Edith. There is the message about rich crooks and common man. The way Crawford treats Holiday is just disgusting(the slap scene was brutal). I liked how Holiday falls for the man who helps here get smart. I can see why many people love this film,but it wasn't my speed/my type. I will say the acting is incredible, and the issues of rich crooks vs everyday folk in this movie are still issues today;it is timeless. It certainly is worth checking out because it is a classic. Many will love this movie, others like me will be more of it's ok, or its a good movie, just not my type of classic. I actually did not laugh at any part of the movie although it is supposed to be a comedy in part.That being said, my mother loved this movie.."
1,home town,"this book was worse than the movie. a few true stories, no one shot the heels off a woman. Columbus,Ga. had the same kind of night spots. After the clean-up of P.c. you could still play the bug in downtown columbus, ga., There are no bodies at the bottom of the river. As an investigator into the murder of Albert Patterson i am speaking as an expert, John Patterson was appointed att.gen. illegally so says the state constitution,he lived in Columbus, Ga.and a person has to live in Ala. for 6 years straight. the whole investigation was fixed and a the wrong person went to jail. Barnes failed to mention this fact. Barnes failed to investigate why all of this came about in Phenix City, Ala."
3,A little dated,"The book was first published in 1970 and the text and the illustrations are showing their age. Let's face it, the kids who where teenagers in it are now in their mid to late 40s. Of course with the 2000s being into the 1970s retro look and sound, maybe what's old is new.That's not to say it wasn't a quick and enjoyable read and Bil Keane's illustrations are humorous too. I recommend flipping through the book once just to enjoy his illustrations. Imagine the Family Circus kids as hippy teenagers. Actually come to think of it, the Family Circus kids probably are actually in their mid to late forties as well."
3,"Okay, I liked it enough.","I am however used to digesting my Keane in smaller doses that is to say less words and more pictures. But I did find Ms. Bombeck's observations to be right in line with Keanes vis a vis the way kids are these days, what with their hijinks and antics. Maybe they can do another collaborative effort together only with more pictures this time. And maybe Ms. Bombeck can let us know what Grandpa is up to!"
3,Not her best.,"This was ok, but not E. Bombeck's best work. I have read some other books by her that were much funnier, and entertaining."
3,"Very, very funny!","Yet another mediocre movie in a lengthy string of losers for all three of the principals involved here: director John Landis and stars Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase. Chase and Aykroyd play a pair of bumbling would-be CIA agents who are spotted cheating on the entrance exam. So the CIA decides to use them as bait in a mission to flummox the Russians. Lots of pointless slapstick and mugging, but Landis hasn't made a genuinely funny film since Trading Places. This film isn't very clever or funny, but it's not a complete waste of time."
3,A fun and entertaining 90 minutes,"This movie definitely doesn't rank as Chevy Chase's or Dan Akroyd's best film, but it holds its own. There are some great bits, and classic Chase physical comedy. The plot is predictable, but there are some fun ideas about Government hideaways and secrecy. I picked this up in a bargain bin for $5, and don't regret it. It takes me back to my childhood, when I watched this movie a hundred times in a month, as it was the only VHS tape I owned."
5,"TRUST ME YOU'LL THANK ME, YOU'LL THANK ME.","AYKROYD and CHASE make a great pair in this one. These two will have you laughing from start to finish. The one liners are great. I recommend this one to all. They don't make them like this any more. It is all about ""Guidance, Source Programable Guidance."" my guidance to you is watch this movie. You will not be dissapointed, expecially if you like these two guys. This is definately a must own classic."
4,Two great actors in a great movie,"Chase and Ackroyd are great together. This movie's gags and storyline are enough to let you feel like you didn't waste the past two hours watching it, but I can't think of anything in it that would make you have to watch it again and again or anything. Still, a great film for these two. Now, if only we could get another Chevy Chase/Bill Murray film, we'd be doing great..."
2,movie deserves a 4 dvd is a 2,i bought this one day and forgot the golden rule look at the box...well I got it home a found out after starting the sucker up it was a pan and scan scam!I'll keep it in the collection until a non-modified from it original version comes out...wide-screen is the way the director intended when will people learn!!!
4,Needs To Be In Widescreen,"Great film, funny comedy with Donna Dixon eye candy.Already own this version and have been waiting for a widescreen release for years.Hopefully they'll be released on Bluray before too long. I can wait."
3,trudge through the first book and...,"You'll be happy you read the rest of the series. I have to agree with debeehr about the lack of depth in both the characters and the plot. Hence, why I barely made it through the first book. The book does gain momentum, but it never reaches its full potential. A good read, nevertheless."
2,Waste of money,"I was very dissapointed. The whole idea of the book is great, but the book is just a big dissapointment. Anne Bishop needs to attend alot of writers workshops."
3,The first book was pretty good,"I really enjoyed the first book, a pretty good political thriller/fantasy novel and a fast read. Unfortunately Jannelle the child is much more interesting than Jannelle the woman and the later two books devolved into a romance novel, not my taste. I think Ladvarian killed it for me; holy Albert Payson Terhune, but this is kitschy (and I own two shelties that I spoil rotten)."
2,Anne Bishop Black Jewels Trilogy,"I haven't finished this book yet, but so far I am not impressed and having a very difficult time getting into it. I'm having to force myself to read it; with a good book, I have to force myself to put it down. Maybe it will get better....."
3,Well...,"I enjoyed this series, but there were some serious flaws. The biggest, for me, was characterization/character development; the characters were inconsistent and pretty much static. Also, the ending was disappointing - so much tension and then... nothing.As I said, I did enjoy the series. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone though."
3,Fantasy meets S&M?,"This was a very interesting trilogy. To call it dark fantasy is certainly accurate although to me is not quite enough. This is more in the vein of some of the vampire novels I have read since it is more of a mixing of equal parts fantasy, horror, romance, and even a little S&M. Not necessarily everyone's cup of tea. I enjoyed the books although some of the ideas were a little disturbing. There is a definite feel of violence to many of the more sexual aspects of this book that young people or those who have had past experience with sexual violence may find disturbing. I would also say that I too felt the writing was slightly inconsistent and found some of the dialogue between characters to be a little trite. Still, overall the books were entertaining, but probably suited to specific audiences only."
2,Not what I hoped...,"I won't bore you with the plot summary and just give you my recommendation:Read this if you like dark fantasy with witches, demon dead, hell, etc. If this isn't your cup of tea, steer clear because it is too long to try to get through if you really aren't into the dark stuff.Maybe I would give this 2.5 stars If I could... not sure.Okay, I have to say that I am not an experienced fantasy reader. I picked up the Sevenwaters Trilogy and absolutely loved it and was searching for something comparable. However, the Black Jewels Trilogy is much different and not as enjoyable for me. I'm not sure if it was the demon dead, the blood sucking, the male slaves, hell, or what. It just didn't grab me and I didn't enjoy it even though I really really wanted to. Sorry, not for me but I could see how others could get into it."
5,One of the best,"I have read a great deal of trilogies but none can compare with this one. It made me cry more than any other book I have read. I am writing this in response because of another review I read by which I was greatly offended. I realize that not everyone may like these books, and I don't expect everyone who reads them to fall in love with them as I have. However to write a review and give a book a bad rating when you have admitted that you have not read it, as Pstanton ""peter_stanton"" did is disgraceful. I realize that the heros in these books are out of the ordinary but that is what makes the trilogy so interesting and unique and just because you are a Christian conservative who does not approve of the charater's identities does not mean it gives you the right to comment on a book you have not even read."
4,A Marvelous Piece,"I'm obsessed with Phantom of the Opera, so anything that deals with it I'm there. I found this book by accident and was intrigued by its cover. I have an open mind when I read fanfics because I respect people's views and opinions and also their fantasies. I must admit, I was a little skeptical at first with this book, but I must say I truly did enjoyed it. Carrie Hernandez' approach to the real story behind ""Little Lotte"" (which is what the whole book concentrates on) is quite interesting. I was extremely shocked when finding out who the REAL Little Lotte was, and after pondering for a bit about it...it all makes sense. This book is based on the original novel, which I find it to be more intriguing since many fics take after the musical (I'm not saying it's bad, it's just a good change). I have to say that Carrie Hernandez did a wonderful job with this book and I highly recommend it to anybody who is interested or is just obsessed with Phantom of the Opera."
3,"Good two-mat bag, but zipper is problematic","This is a basic (no pockets or embellishments), but sturdily-constructed, bag that accomodates two mats rolled up together, one of which for me is 84"" extra-long, and has more than enough spare room for a water bottle, wristlet and keys. Watch out for the zipper -- mine stuck if zipped too far upon closing, and broke off altogether after about 10 uses. Amazon quickly sent a replacment (thank you Amazon), but much to my dismay, the replacement shares the sticky zipper problem. A design flaw? Unfortunate, because I've always enjoyed good quality from Hugger Mugger products."
1,Might have liked it better if I read it in Junior High.,"This is certainly one of the most over rated books of the 20th century. I had heard and read such glowing descriptions (And, in fact, the actual concept of Catch 22 is brilliant). However, the writing is so juvenile that I wish I had read it in Junior High instead of after college. Heller is seemingly willing to expend untold pages of drivel to bring off a joke, as in how Major Major became Major Major Major. This book would have been more powerful and more readable as a short story. 50 pages max. I had to force myself to plod through this sophomoric mess. When the war finally ended, no one in the book was more relieved than I."
1,"Unorganized, too many characters to keep straight",I has read this novel for a English Class in collage and I found it absolutely mortifying. The psycho Yossarian with his flashbacks of memories and women who are protrayed at whores appaled me. I don't recommend this book to anyone who doesn't like idiotic scenes about nothing important.
1,Main point of Catch 22: Nothing is worth fighting for.,"First of all, the only part of the book that was worth reading was the end, but one thing that REALLY REALLY ANNOYED ME about this book is that is states:1. The military is bad and unorganized2. Whoever is in the military is an idoit3. Whoever opposes the military is heroicTHESE ARE COMPLETELY FALSE! I HATED THIS BOOK SO MUCH AND I THINK THAT IT SUMS UP TO..... MAIN POINT IN CATCH 22: Nothing is worth fighting for."
5,This book is very funny,"This book is a very funny novel about Yossarian, a solder that flies for the Air Force. To get out of the Air Force you need to fly a certan number of missions. But Colonel Cathcart, a leader of Yossarian, keeps raising the number of missions. So, Yossarian is stuck. This book has all kinds of humor, and will keep you laughing. I have never read a better book. I would HIGHLY recommend this book if you are one for humor, action, and more humor."
5,What Funny Is,"Catch-22 is one of the funniest book ever written. Funny is not just a way of saying it made me giggle. Really funny novels are funny because they provide surprising insight into the way human beings truly are. Among classics Catch-22 is the funniest I've read. Brauner's Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf is the funniest contemporary novel because it has similar amazing insights -- but it's not a war novel, and who knows if it will have the relevance that Catch-22 does fifty years later, but anyway I just love both these books."
5,I've ONLY READ HALF THE BOOK! Hehe,"Ok, as you've read, I've only read half of the book, Catch 22, but I think that it's wonderful! For those who read this book, I think that you will find it incredibly funny or incredibly weird. In my case, I found it incredibly funny. It is about Yossarian, a bombardier in the war (which one, I forget, hehe), and his life there with INCREDIBLY hilarious friends. I can't wait to finish this book, and I hope that everyone will at least attempt to read it...I'll go finish it now."
2,Strange but not good,"Hard to read, strange book. Not sure why anyone would like it- it just doesn't seem to be well written, so even with the whole catch 22 point which is pretty clever, it is just bad."
3,"ironic,funny,confusing....","I've never read a book that was so ironic, funny and confusing like this one. It had crazy characters, most of them you can't relate to. And like the title, there was a catch, bureaucracy (or hipocracy) to almost every thing. I enjoyed the book. but be warned, you'll find yourself rereading paragraphs that just make no sense the first time around."
3,the catch is catch 22,"Although critically acclaimed as "" An Apocalyptic Masterpiece"" by the Chicago Tribune the absence of an on going plot prevents the reader from being consistently interested. Which thus at times gets a little boring to read after a while. However it's hilarious satire and distinguished characters makes this novel a must read."
1,hmmmm....,more of a modern day substance-less story... many charecter.. hard readering. i could have summerized the point in a bout half a sentence
1,Catch-22,"In my words Catch-22 is overrated. This book could have been summed up in one chapter, and in all its wordiness the only point is that war is extremely boring. Although each chapter had something exciting, Joseph Heller droned on relentlessly about a single character. The climax of the book is when Yossarian is up in the bomber on a mission to Bologna and the gunners guts fall out, because a piece of flak went into his stomach. The whole time the gunner is crying out ""I'm cold, I'm cold!"" One side of the book that I liked was how Joseph Heller made each chapter about one person, which makes it slightly better, because the cast is always growing. Each character is unique, and I value that, but his subject matter poor. All in all I had to force myself to read this book."
4,Anti-war novel at its finest!,"A group of my friends went to Stockton State College to see a theater presentation of Catch-22. We all decided to reread the novel;all of us had read the book in high school english.The times have changed. There is a very pro military culture in the United States today. I think Heller's satire is probably closer to the truth about the efficiency of the military. The people who 'liberated' Iraq will be postal workers in about ten years. And not very good ones either.There are good wars that must be fought, one must concede. Most of the time,however, it is just male ego and ambition run amok. You might say, what if everyone felt that way?Then I'd be a damned fool to feel otherwise."
2,Didn't do it justice,"When I read this book I was rolling with laughter at the sardonic wit that infused it. Yossarian as Everyman, struggling to define himself and to get by and get over at the same time. This audiobook production somehow never grabbed me. I found myself drifting every time I tried to listen. Was it me? Was it the intervening years? I don't know. I do know that this is a great piece of 20th Century literature that somehow is not done justice in this version.Catch-22"
3,"There is no ""i"" in ""team"", but there is in ""win""","Throughout most of the book Catch-22, I was left dazed and confused as to what was going on in the stroy. In fact, I have no idea what the real storyline is, but I can say this, having read the book; the author attempts to define the Catch-22 numerous times by telling stories of each of the characters lives, and how they try to achieve something, but they never seem to be able to get there, for one reason or another. Joseph Heller therefore proves the Catch-22 exists. but beyond this main point, I do not recognize any form of story developing. The whole story seemed to be going around in circles, and, if it wasnt for the humorous parts within the book every now and then, I may have put it down in utter confusion as to what was going on in the book. Without the humor, the book did not tie itself together, so, for the little that I did get from the book, I owe it to the humor."
3,"Funny, thought-provoking and somewhat disturbing.","This is one of those books that bothered me while I was reading it. Sure it was funny but I also felt insulted as I read. Nonetheless, I always picked it up the next day and read on.Let me start by saying that I preferred M*A*S*H much more because it didn't take itself too seriously. It was raunchier and 100 times funnier. Catch-22 simply tries way too hard. The paradoxical, catch-22 situations are too many and grow tiresome. The whole book is that way! It could have been about 200 pages shorter!The insulting part is how military professionals are all portrayed as complete and utter idiots. Sure, all the characters are very quirky and idiosyncratic, but the military pros are absolutely unlikable and seem to possess no redeeming qualities like the others. As one who has read a great deal of WWII history this was bothersome. I understand the literary technique but it's just too much.READ M*A*S*H INSTEAD. SAVE THIS FOR LATER. YOSSARIAN LIVES."
1,terrible,"This is the most over-hyped book I have ever read. I forced myself through it, hoping it would get better, but it never did. It's boring & difficult to read. I'm baffled by all the praise. Don't do it!"
1,Problem,"Two of the CD's had some type of glue residue on them from the CD jacket. When I tried to clean one of them, the CD was damaged and rendered unusable. So, I am now missing one CD in the set - about a 4 chapter gap. Not happy about it."
5,makes sense in randomness,"i feel the book is a challenge to conventional way of writing novel. the storytelling is not straightforward and the humor is not easily forthcoming. But, this is what makes catch-22 a unique book. although the randomness is evident, but so is the sense derived out of randomness. does it discuss futility of war? yes it does. does it challenge the whole concept of courage as we understand of it being possessed by every martyr of a war? yes it does. does it challenge the belief that every law is benevolent? yes it does. and in spite of handling such serious issues, does it make the reader laugh? i think, yes- it does make one laugh till the guts are about to spill out.thanks,PravinOnce upon a time in the land of Jasmine Revolution and some short stories"
5,There is no other book like Catch-22,"I could never read a book in the same way after reading Catch-22. It showed me what an author with a true love of words could do. I have never read anything as funny, or as sad. I've read it three times since the first time I picked it up, two years ago. I think it's one of the best books ever written. I recommend it for anyone"
4,Great book. I really enjoyed it.,"This book came highly recommended and I was not disappointed. Catch-22 is weird, mixed up, irrational and bewildering, but totally sane. Some parts provoked thought, some parts provoked confusion, some parts provoked laughter, all parts were entertaining. I absolutely recommend it."
5,Like Vonnegut?,"To anyone with a sweet-tooth for satire of the highest sort:Stop reading reviews and get your hands on a copy. It might very well change your outlook on war, and life, forever."
4,Appreciate half way through,"This was one of those books that I constantly found in top 10 lists and beckoning to be picked up on many bookstore shelves. Also, I was intrigued how a book's title could gain such significance with its concept becoming such a common term.The story is a tangled web of nonlinear narrative, unrelentingly logic looping, mental instability, military ineptitude, and satire. It took some time to completely embrace, but about half way through I found myself really gaining emotional attachment to the character ensemble and finally an admirer of the work as a whole. Now I can understand why this subversive work has lasted 40 years as a great American novel."
5,Catch-22 is an UNDERrated classic,"Catch-22 was throughly enjoyable. It's wild, insane illogical plot kept me laughing for hours. Characters such as the timid Major Major Major Major, the lovable Chaplain and Yossarian, and the capitalist Milo Minderbinder remind us of how human nature really is. It truly is an American classic. Those of you who disliked the book should try reading it again, appreciating this masterpiece by Joseph Heller."
4,A Comedy though a Tragedy,"Catch-22 by Joseph Heller is a great book. In the beginning, the book starts great, though it seemed that some of the jokes were no that funny. Many of the characters were great and some of them were comparable. There were many hilarious scenes that I thought were great in the novel. Though at times, character's seemed very ignorant and immature. This novel is also great, for having an aspect of how many people that are in war have. There must be many individuals in war that might feel the way that Yossarian felt. Though this book is a comedy, Heller made a mixture of Comedy in the beginning and Tragedy in the end."
3,confusing,"I only have one word for this book, confusing. The novel has a great story line, and is rather funny, but I suggest making a time-line to help you understand whether you're in the past or present. The two best ways of telling this are by the number of missions that must be completed before coming home and when there is someone, who died earlier in the novel, walking around. I would also like to add that there are not much war scenes (which is good for me, because I don't like war novels)."
4,This phone is great,"I love this phone, the 3 handsets are a plus..I set up a special ring for when my daughter calls. I also like theidea of transferring the phone book info from phone to phone.-The only con I can think of is that when the phone is set on auto answer and you pick up the phone, there is a loud static like noise..But that is minor..I am a phone fanatic, for ""my"" money it was worth every penny (I wish I'd gotten in on the $127 sale)."
2,NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS EXPECTED!,"I was really hoping for a winner with this phone system, but after trying it out I found the sound quality and handset volume to be very poor - not nearly as good as an older VTech phone that I currently use. I'm definitely sending the Panasonic back and will be continuing my seemingly endless search for a phone that actually performs well in the important categories. Despite some good features, I certainly can't recommend this Panasonic model."
5,Classic Soul,"Anyone who digs classic soul will love these discs! I grew up listening to these songs, and can sing and move and groove to each and every one. This is a must-have for your collection. Great party music too!"
1,Rip Off,"I hate this book. Ordered expecting new material. What I got was a photocopy ripoff of a few chapters from the out of published book they probably bought at a library sale. Lame, lame, lame. Don't get fooled by this knock-off. Only useful if you don't have any research skills. Shame on Amazon for stocking this."
4,First Alert Fire Extinguisher,"I bought this for my apartment upstairs, and I am sure it will work great! (hope I never have to use it, but feel safe having it there!)"
2,Comes Half Empty,"Mine arrived half empty and I think that it is a little much to pay for an empty can. However, the can is still a functional one and I was able to pay another $20 to get it filled up. Also, I can reuse this one so that is nice."
4,Excellent Beginner Book,Excellent book. I built an ASP site within a week of opening this book up. The pictures included in the book really do help you learn very fast. Don't expect the book to go into detail on the more complicated parts of ASP though. I wished the database section of the book was a little bit longer but not a big problem because the internet has so many resources on that part.
2,Really not a good book.,"This book is very flawed. It is more likely to confuse a beginner than enlighten them.The first major flaw: No real 'big picture' of the topic is offered. The book consists of small superficial sections, one devoted to each element of ASP. The problem is that each element is not satisfactorally placed in a context.But worst of all is the books 'visual' approach, supposedly helpful. Why on earth would a reader need to be told to press tab to indent a piece of text, each and every time it is required? This overkill of step by step visual explanation becomes absurd.Check it out before you buy it."
5,Superb and Classic,"The First Book of Swords is a wonderful beginning to a truly awesome series. Even if you do not intend to ever read all of the books, this first book is a winner.Saberhagen created this as an entry to one of the very few series of books that I would be tempted to give ""5-stars"" to the entire series.I really liked the way the Gods are handled throughout the book; and who could ever forget Drafut.....If you enjoy fantasy or sci-fi, read this book. It will be worth it."
1,Not worth the money,not a very good cd. don't waste your money on this recording.there are a lot of better Cuban Cd's out there.belive it or not that's a woman singing on this cd. I thought it was a man singing and to my surprise it ewas a woman with a very manly voice.
2,mediocre,This is not much to look at. Mine came with some small scratches on the plexiglass. The effect is not all that great.
5,Delicious!!!,"These are, the MOST delicious, dried blueberries we've ever bought! They are sweetened just enough, don't stick together in a lump, are just slightly juicy, have no preservatives AND taste great refrigerated! For those who are wondering, 4# just fits in a 1-gallon zip lock bag. On the box, it says a serving size is 1/3 cup and there are 42 servings. They were just over $50 on sale. I will buy these again!"
5,Great Blueberries!,"Like eating freshly picked, the best yet! Just don't package them with a seal-a-meal, squeezes the juices right out of them:)Will definitely purchase more!"
1,Poor substitute for my lost tool.,"It looks the same, but it isn't. My old tool, that someone borrowed and did not care to return, was much sturdier. This one, although it looks exactly the same, is of flimsy nature. One has to use it very carefully, so the handle does not break at the point where it joins the blade. Very thin, very delicate tubing bends as easily as an overcooked noodle. I know I will not find a similar tool made with quality at home. This one, of course, is made in China. But I will redouble my efforts to find out who borrowed the old one from me, and I will GET IT BACK. When I do get it back, this new purchase will go to the scrap yard."
4,Up to 1000 uses.,"This item is advertised to last up to 1000 uses. I know that ""up to 1000"" means 1000 or less. However, we got about 30 uses before a small hole showed up. That is not even in the ball park for ""up to 1000 uses."" Also, nothing ever came in contact with the parchment other than the dough, my hands, or wiping it with a soft wet cloth.UPDATE:Yes the parchment did develop a tiny hole, however it is over a year later and I am still using it with no adverse effects. I should give it the benefit of the doubt and say it could possibly have been something that I did that caused it. Regardless, it is still usable. So I am upgrading my review from one star to four."
2,Returned three to store-never got one that worked.,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. We couldn't get the screw out to put the batteries in. Once I finally got them in, I went to put the cord in to the guitar and found that the piece was jammed into the guitar so far I couldn't plug it in. I took it back to the store and got a new one. Put the batteries in it and it didn't work. Took that one back and got another one. That one didn't work either. Unbelievable. I'm done."
1,Huge Disappointment,"As with the other reviewers, Santa delivered this toy for our 2 1/2 year old son. He was soooooo excited. Unfortunately,we first of all could not get the screws out of guitar to put the batteries in and then when we finally did get the batteries in, it does not work. When I tried to exchange it at Toys R Us, they are of course out of stock. There was a shopping cart behind the return counter at Toys R Us with 4 more of these that had been returned becuase they do not work. My son was soooooo disappointed. Shame on the toy companies for making such a faulty product that seems to have disappointed little children everywhere on Christmas morning. The company that manufactured this toy needs should be held accountable and make restitution."
5,DK Classics: Aladdin,"I just wanted to advise of a correction relating to the ""Editorial Review"" for this book. It refers to the series ""D.K. READERS"" (formerly ""EYEWITNESS READERS"") rather than the series ""D.K. CLASSICS"" (formerly ""EYEWITNESS CLASSICS""). The two series share some of the same titles, but the text of the D.K. CLASSICS is closer to that of the origninal works upon which they are based. There are also sidebars on most pages that describe the historical setting for the book and sometimes provide a comparison of the same setting as it is today. The D.K. CLASSICS series are great for doing book reports or for making history come alive through great literature."
4,Funny for those who can handle it,"I haven't seen either of these for years. I loved them both when I was growing up. Suburban Commando, well I loved this one. These are the movies I will forever remember Hulk Hogan from. Super cheesy and ridiculous so not for some. But for people who loved them growing up and maybe watched when past midnight - things are always funnier then!"
4,Slick and well acted,James Mason at it again? Has anyone ever seen Mr. Mason give even a mediocre performance? I have not!Here he plays to the hilt an agent selling secrets from embassy safes. Mason cooly imbibes his character and is really superb in this kind of part.Michael Rennie trys to track him down and Danielle Darreaux lures him into trap of her own designs. Wether playing Rommel( The Desert Fox) and Irish rebel ( Odd Man Out) or even the very difficult to find ( The Man Between) Mason is always good to watch.
2,Teach MeTonight,I didn't like it at all. It looks like it would be a great movie but once the movie gets started I could tell I was not going to like it one bit.
2,So So,You can download better adult rated movie than this from so many sites now a days. This was waste of money on my part. After seeing it once it went on shleve. Save your money and do not buy this.
2,Teach Me What??!,"A typical exotic thriller, ""Teach Me Tonight"" does not offer any valuable lessons. The first scam presented by this film is that the seductive beauty on the movie cover is not even in the movie! Big let down right off. The real main character has short, dark hair, terrible implants, and best yet - plays a biochemistry graduate student! The first sex scene is pretty hot - gives the impression the movie might have something to offer - further analysis proves that all the sex scenes are pretty much the same; same positions, actors, music and sequence of events!! There are three scenes that stand out not due to their excellence but simply for their change from the typical scenes the movie offers. Over all, this film (obviously) does not present strong plot or characters. If you are looking for sex scenes every five minutes - this will do. But don't expect anything original, impressive or creative."
2,Quality not great,"The price is right but the hat has an annoying flaw. The plastic insert for adjusting the hat to head size slips in and out of the inner hat grooves too easily. So, we end up with a detached insert (think plastic shell) and the hard hat that, if worn without the insert, hurts like crazy because the grooves are little hard plastic pegs that stick out and poke your head. My son is constantly asking me to affix the insert that seems to come off every time he merely lifts the hat on or off his head, or if the hat slides to one side. Even though this one is inexpensive, I would recommend another hat because the hat actually doesn't serve its purpose if it won't stay on a kid's head or hurts him!"
4,Sticks and Stones,"New Found Glory being New found Glory. Their sound never varies much, but somehow they always manage to peak my interest."
5,EDITED (4.5 stars... a great CD) now 5 stars,"In my original review, I gave this CD 4.5 stars because of two songs I didn't like too much. Forget about that, the rest of the incredible songs make up for it.Be warned, on the first listen, you may think NFG is a little slow and soft, but that's only on the first listen, and because sometimes the intros start out a little softer. They are actually harder than their self titled. ------ And FINALLY, NFG has their own sound. ----- It's awesome... here's my top 5 songs.Understatement - Fast and hard. Great start to CD A+My Friends Over You - A bit slower, but still good. ASonny - Great lyrics, really cool sound, kind of new for them This is easily my fav song on the CD. A+It's Been A Summer - Didn't like at first, now I love it. A Singled Out - Fast, cool guitar riffs. AGet this CD now. You won't regret it."
2,Very Average Album,"I bought this CD thinking it would be an add on to my punk/pop/ska collection I own. I was rather disappointed. Almost every song on this album is about a girl, losing a girl, or an ex-girlfriend. I also think Jordan Pundik needs to have his voice mature a bit more because ""In the Story So Far"" it gets annoying. ""It's Been A Summer"" is a good song but it just goes too slow. ""Understatement"" seems like an annoying pop hit and so does ""My Friends Over You."" In addition, it seems like as you listen to ""Head On Collision"" you really get sick of it after a bit. Good songs on the Album include ""Sonny"", ""Something I Call Personality"", and ""Forget My Name."" It seems like other songs are poorly written. It doesn't seem like New Found Glory is living up to all of their talent. If you like this kind of music and want something better, I'd check out either of Good Charlotte's albums."
1,This sucks,"To that stupid ass ""punk rock"" this crap ain't punk! It's barely even rock! You say Metallica sucks when yuou this this gay band! NFG's singer sounds like a whining baby, while James is an excellent singer. NFG has dumb lyrics, and even Metallica's new album is better!Now back to this album, it sucks. If you want punk get albums from The Misfits, The Ramones, Sex Pistols, The Clash, The Virus, The Unseen, NoFX, Minor Threat, Dead Kennedys, Dropkick Murphys, etc. I'm done here."
5,NFG rockz,this is cd is the best cd out there. i first lstened to it through my 14 year old daughter. the beat is jumpy and my teenage daughter loves it. she plays it all day and night. def. worth ur money
5,my favorite CD ever,"This CD is awesome. i listen to it atleast once everyday, and i absolutely love it. it gives me just the right amount of punk, without all of the ""scary"" elements usually associted with the genre. The songs are all upbeat and catchy. i bought this CD with only have heard ""My Friends Over You"", and i was not dissapoiunted at all. if you are looking to expand your musical horizons or just a good CD to listen to, this is definitely the CD to get."
5,NFG ROCKS!!!!!!!,"Wow, I'm not dissappointed with this Cd! The new Midtown CD is better in my oppinion, but this is the 2nd best Cd of this year, well fans of Midtown, The Undecided, Relient K, All Wound Up, and MxPx should get one of the best emo cds around. Well I gotta run to Crossway and buy the new Side Walk Slam Cd. Sticks and Stones won't break my bones, and New Found Glory rules!!!!!"
2,Coming Soon To A Teen Movie Near You...,This is boring. Everything sounds so perfect and clean that there is no variation to the album. Big disappointment.
3,Ehh,Every song sounds the same. Every song is relationship or love based and theres no memorable guitar parts or anything. Just mediocre. I recommend GC's first album instead.
3,It's okay......,"With hindsight I feel I had to rewrite my review as time has erased the initial joy of a new NFG album. I was expecting this to be really good but it wasn't. It's okay but I wouldn't highly recommend it. Unlike previous albums (or indeed the new one) I only love one song, Sonny, and I think thats only for sentimental value.Jordan's voice, which ordinarily I love, grates on me through this album. Sorry, but I've been a fan a long time and I know they can do MUCH better than this.For those new to NFG, do yourselves a favour and buy ANY of their other albums as this one will not convert anyone into a fan."
2,Catchy tunes and not much else,"Granted, the songs on this album are very infectious and at times fun to sing along to, but that is all this album has to offer. It has no musical depth and the music is pretty repeatitive; i.e. all the songs pertain to ex-girlfriends, and the subject gets old fast. However, New Found Glory will sit perfectly for young girls and for TRL viewers. I think that New Found Glory had the potential to be decent musicians, but this album just showcases the new generation of boy band music."
3,Disappointing,"I am a huge NFG fan, so I couldn't wait to get this album. Their last album was so great, so I had high expectations, but man was I disappointed. There are 3 good songs on this album: Understatement, My Friends Over You, and Something I Call Personality. The rest of this is run of the mill ... This is definitely a step back for them. It's too bad because they could have been great. Oh, well, maybe next album."
5,NFG ROCKS!,THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE CDS I HAVE. I THINK THIS IS AN AWSOME CD AND YOU SHOULD BUY IT IF YOU REALLY LIKE PUNK ROCK.
2,Not what you think your getting--Read Carefully!!,"If you are purchasing this for a class, I highly recommend that you purchase the package from the schools bookstore. I tried to purchase all of the ""parts"" on amazon and because the discriptions are sketchy I ended up spending more trying to get all that I needed for the class than I would have. For instance they split the CD that normally comes with the book seperatly, and they split the SAM CDs from the student manual. When the SAM CDs arrived they had been opened and were missing half the CD's (ordered from Amazon), although Amazon is fixing it with no fuss, the shipping time means that I will not have the CD's in time for class, and I have to HOPE the next ones they send are complete!"
5,The Best Science Fiction Movie Ever Made!!!!!!,"The Movie starts out were 5 Astronauts are travling in space they land on a mysterious planet run by apes. Mackeup designer Chambers received a special oscar. Starring: Chalton Heston, Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter and Maurice Evans and alot more!! Director: Franklin J. Schaffner. END"
4,Planet Of The Apes,"I bought this Movie for my Husband, I am not particularly a Planet of the ape fan. It was just what I wanted and I know he enjoyed the movie. For its time in history it was well made, has a good story line and takes you back to another time."
1,Great movie w/ terrific plot twist! So why give ending away?,"Terrific movie is deserving of 4 stars. Poorly-conceived DVD/VHS packaging is worth 1 star.I saw 'Planet of the Apes' years ago, and to-date it remains one of my favorite SF movies. It had one of the best surprise endings of all time, ranking up there with the likes of 'The Sixth Sense', 'The Usual Suspects', 'The Sting', 'Wild Things' and 'No Way Out'.I noticed that the cover of both the DVD and VHS versions (as shown on Amazon.com) gives away the ending of the movie. Now this doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever. I guess some marketing genius at 20th Century Fox believes that everyone has already seen this movie and knows the ending, without thinking that there might be a whole generation of kids who have never seen the film.Since the DVD version will not be released until 21st August 2001, may I suggest to the folks at 20th Century Fox to change the packaging if it is still possible."
5,Classic true and true,"Born in 1968 I was a planet of the apes fanatic as a child. I recently viewed this movie again as a 30 year old and it is even more phenomenal. The social commentary on hunting as well as the debates on evolution vs creation are very well written. Charlton Heston is awesome. ""Get your hands off me you ... ape"" and the ""Damn you..."" lines are classics!"
5,A classic film,"This film has been awarded entry to the NFR(National Film Registry). That is quite an honor, as only classic films are given this treatment. Unlike the 2001 re-make, this film is a political film. It's about human ideas and how people fear those who differ from them. A series of films followed, but this is the one that should be listed with the greatest films ever made."
1,Planet of the Apes (Bluray),the DVD does not work. It begins with the introduction and that is all. No movie at all. Last time I purchase one from Amazon.
2,Great movie deserves better!,"Franklin J. Schaffner has directed some of the most magnificent looking movies ever (Patton, Papillion, Islands in the Stream, etc) and I was excited to see the Blu-ray treatment given to arguably his most famous film Planet of the Apes. Sadly, this one misses the boat.The colors are faded and not dynamic in the least and, to be honest, it looks less than I would expect from a standard DVD release.To make matters worse, I know there are loads of features and additional Planet of the Apes material out there and this disc has none of it save for some decent commentary from some of the stars.Wait until a better treatment comes out."
3,Save your money!,"This release offers very little in the way of new material. If you already own the Evolution box set, this goes double for you. The commentary tracks, in you can call them that, are spotty and pieced together from old interviews. One of the few actual new bits turns out to be an old Mego toy ad that looks and sounds terrible! Menu graphics, as well as the box art itself, are really lame. This is a fine example of the license holder strip-mining its property!"
3,Where is the Anamorphic transfer and where is the DTS?,Love the film but my DVD box says the film is 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen AND it claims to have a DTS 5.1 soundtrack.The film has neither a DTS sound track (only DD) nor is it an anamorphic transfer! What gives??Rich
5,CLASSIC MOVIE! AWFUL PACKAGING!,"I give 5 stars to the film, which, in my opinion, is one of the greatest films ever. The packaging for the 35th anniv. edition is awful. First they put a photo of Caesar (from Conquest) on the cover, the back cover has a photo of Ursus (from Beneath) and the inside opens up to the gorilla stadium scene from Beneath. Are they clueless at Fox??? The film is Planet and should include photos from Planet (not its sequels!!!) Secondly, most of the special features are recycled material. I was really dissapointed with the section of Ape Merchanside and Ape Collections. There are hundreds of ape collectibles and all they show are a few Mego figures and wind-up Medicom figures. what a joke! Then for the Ape Collections they show a few masks, facial appliances and costumes. How weak! I thought I would be seeing some actual collections. Anyways, the movie is a classic, but once again the folks at Fox have butchered it's DVD release."
4,This movie is great and did not need a remake,"In my opinion, all of Charlton Heston's movies should stay as it. They don't need to be redone."
4,Great for junior tech writers,"As any good tech author knows, a manual must be targeted to your audience, and this does just that. This is a great book to introduce a junior tech author to the concepts involved in creating good documentation. Experienced authors should look elsewhere."
3,"Well, it's just another book...","Having been a technical writer for 20+ years, I once again was surprised that someone failed to convey what it's really all about. While it does have some sections that are ""worth while,"" overall, it's just too basic and more in keeping as a college level read. What it boils down to is that 'real technical writing' is a combination of ability, skill, and experience - none of which can really be taught in a book!"
4,Great for breakfast,"I bought these bars because I never eat breakfast. I hate eggs, don't like most cereals, etc. I know breakfast is important so I decided to try these. They taste okay, leave a gritty aftertaste. With these particular ones I can taste the chocolate but it's lacking in the peanut butter taste. I will definitely keep eating them though because they do work. I had one for breakfast two days in a row and did not find myself feeling hungry until it was lunch time. On the third day I decided to try a bowl of cereal (Cheerios to be exact) because it was convenient. An hour after I ate the cereal I felt as if I was starving. Thank goodness I had an apple with me because I devoured it but was still hungry! Obviously the cereal did not satisfy me the way the bars did. I will keep eating them and am curious about trying the protein shakes."
5,Delicious,"Great product! These snack bars total only 110 calories and keep you full till your next meal. The first time I tried these, I found it difficult to believe I wasn't eating candy. If you're trying to lose weight or if you just want a healthier alternative to your daily candy fix, this is the item for you."
1,Secularist reading material from an academic secularist,"Chapter 1, titled ""How Christianity came to Power"". First 60 pages, the number of (bracketed) references to quotes from the Bible in those first 60 pages: 2Enough said."
2,offended by put-downs of Cuba,"We see what we're prepared to see, I suppose. Another reviewer noted the ""pro-Castro"" perspective of this guide. I saw just the opposite. I left it at home because i did not want to carry to Cuba the attitude of the author, which I thought was disrespectful and sometimes snide. It's somewhat more thorough and easy to use (tho bulkier) than the Rough Guide. I recommend taking some pages from this one along with the RG, or (better), buy the RG & check the website for updates. I'm sorry I bought the Moon Handbook."
5,Amazing Book,"I see this book as a must read. its incredibly written, and takes the reader on the main charecters roller-coaster of emotions. the writter has a great sense of rythem in his writting style and uses it well by keeping it fresh for the reader. It is not a happy story, its not a heart renching story either... this book absorbed me, and took me along with the main charecters, Hal's, emotions and thought process.. sometimes intense, and sometimes bubbling with subtle humor, its a great story. ive brought myself to read more than once."
2,PowerBuilder 6.5 certainly has its problems,"While the language itself is not all that bad (in some aspects its actually quite good). The compiler itself is hindered by a multitude of bugs and idiosyncrasies that make your average developer start foaming at the mouth.If you intend on buying this product, be prepared to develop a one to one relationship with Powersoft/Sybase's support department...some of the problems are solved by applying patches, but yet some remain because 'we wish to retain compatibility with the previous (bugged) versions'...frustrating response to say the least...I hope they get it right next time, would be a shame if it was canned (by developers considering dropping the language), as i said its quite a good language (and it is, honest), just a crap compiler."
4,good job,"after all the fuss was over, got correct cd with no issues. recommended cd and bizzness to seller rapactions."
3,Torn between two opinions,"Honestly, I don't know what to make of this book. It was definitly a good read. A bit repetitive? Yes. Original and provacative? Again, yes. Comparable to Joyce? I'm just not sure.There may be genius yet to be discovered, hiding beneath the tiresome diatrabe that Markson calls a novel.To those who believe so, please enlighten me. To those who are sure that this is simply more overrated deconstructionism gone wrong, dig a little deeper. There just might be something hiding under there."
3,"Wonderful story, but could have been much shorter","The commentary on lonliness is well done, but I found the endless cultural references tedious. I also didn't think that the roundabout connections created made much difference to the story itself. Definitely recommended but with the caveat that it requires mucho endurance to slog through the references."
3,good controller except for joy sticks,"controller connects easily however after kids played for two days, one of the left joy sticks on the white controller broke...seemed like cheap plastic part. i hope the company sends me a new part or some other means to fix it?"
4,PC-cillin Home Security Pack,"There are several reasons to like Trend Micro products. Key among them is the close relationship that Trend Micro enjoys with Microsoft. Norton and McAfee both tend to be slow in adopting use of the latest interfaces (API's) and this puts them behind the 8 ball. TM's products have been hard to get in the past, but the use of the latest technology is very much in their favor. They were the first to be able to integrate with Microsoft Sharepoint and their corporate presence is pretty strong. They are very aggressive in getting fixes out. I've used their products for 5 years+ and have consistently been pleased with both the service and protection they afford."
2,Was ok till I installed on other computers,I renewed my subscription....they wouldn't send an updated version on cd....when i loaded on other computers...none worked....even when I downloaded correct version off the web....spam filter won't work....Won't bother with this again...
2,Drama-mean,"Literary arrogance at its height, this book takes simple concepts and makes them obtuse. If that is an accomplishment, then I'll grant the praise. I would prefer some of her contemporaries like Waugh or Cathers who's prose gives me far more pleasure without the hubris - and in the end teaches me far more about life, and writing. Don't be intimidated by pedants who call this great, trust your own judgement and the emperor's clothes reveal themselves for what they aren't."
4,A nice wholesome family movie,Very enjoyable movie that easily deserves to be added to your home collection. Kirk Douglas underscores his brilliant acting talent to convince the audience of Vincent's lifelong struggles regarding his passion for painting. Outstanding quality VHS coupled with immediate shipment from Amazon made this inexpensive purchase most satisfying.
3,REALITY SHOW 4 ARTISTS!!!,"why has no one thought of this concept.... consider the intrinsic nature of artists and their ideals would provide a most fascinating insight for the more astute audiences of reality tv... the intrigue of man vs creation, man vs roommate, man vs mental state, etc., made this film a must see for Van Gogh lovers, and I mean love, his life dedicated to his art and the toil and strife to consistently achieve his goals, what a taskmaster and visionary... lust for life is a misnomer, lust for conversion of visuals to canvas was the order of the day and to see the actual masterpieces in the film was a devine treat... I have had the pleasure of viewing films about Rodin, Pollock, Michelangelo, Frida, Gauguin, etc., but Van Gogh parlayed the most heart wrenching, palpable mix of emotions... high recommend for art lovers but also for those who strive to express their personal genius of the highest order, thank you Vincent for such a fine production."
4,A fascinating academic read,"This academic text includes primary sources, the translations of the letters (10) of Eshinni (1182-1268?) a woman of medieval Japan. The letters were discovered in 1921. I was anticipating more letters, however, it is amazing that they exist at all. The text is an exploration of actual living conditions in 13th century Japan. It is an excellent resource for students of Buddhism, Japanese history, and thew role women played in medieval Japan."
2,Feldman's book isn't bad as a work of fiction,"But fiction is the catagory it should be in. Unfortunately Feldman placed the book into a mooshy catagory between the two. If a reader wants an interesting read this is one. If a reader wants to know facts about the Lost Adams Diggings the goal is more likely to be achieved by reading Four Days From Fort Wingate by Richard French.Feldman's shakey premise that the Adams Diggings is where he says (and that it's been found) is based on an even shakier bibliography taken mostly out of Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver by Frank Dobie, then misquoted. The fact that he's presented it somewhat as fact by giving a bibliography distracts somewhat from what would otherwise be a pleasant and interesting read. If you find yourself tempted to believe anything in this book check the footnote references he uses to support his premises and follow them back to the original document text. The Feldman book is historical fiction. Nothing more or less."
3,"Great jazz, but disk quality is a bit off","I consider the Modern Jazz Quartet at the Music Inn with Jimmy Giuffre to be one of the great moments in Jazz. I have an old cassette tape made from a vinyl LP 35 years ago, and so was very excited to be able to get this disk. And I am not sorry I got it---but it is not remastered from original tapes. Seems more like an amateur digitizing job, with a good deal of sound overloading things. Still, I was glad to get this and will continue to hope for a more professionally recorded release.Bottom line--If you love this moment in jazz, it's probably worth getting this disk, but sound quality ain't great."
3,my dogs' favourite food,"High-quality product. Cannot complain about formula, does the trick, healthy food to keep dog happy and healthy. However, very hard to get - so few distributors, very high price and super-expensive shipping. I would not mind paying higher price if the shipping was free. Therefore, I have to give it a lower rating to reflect the drawbacks."
1,NOT GLUTEN FREE,"This comes up on a gluten free search, but this is not gluten free. Soy sauce contains wheat. Unless it is specifically wheat free soy sauce, which is uncommon and not indicated."
1,Dries out very quickly.,"Perhaps I received an old package, or it had some other problem, but the pens I had dried out very quickly. I first noticed that the cap on the fine point end did not hold on very well. So I concentrated on putting it on securely each time. When it dried out, I thought that the loose cap had been the problem. So on the next pen, I taped the fine end on with electrician's tape, so it couldn't get loose. I also made sure to press the cap on the larger end, but it soon dried out and I had written on very few CD's compared to how long a sharpie would last.It is not worth the money for how long these pens have lasted. I have never had problems with other pens, although I have read that problems do occur. And I do back up my material to an external hard drive also."
3,A Period Piece But Worth Reading,"Think ""Bug Jack Barron"" missed winning the Nebula Award the year it was published. Although some of Spinrad's short stories should have won the Nebula, this book was not Nebula material. There are a number of flaws in the book and it is extremely dated if read today, and several of the main characters seem to speak in the same way and in the same cadence.Even so, Spinrad is a remarable writer and almost anything he has written is worth reading. Barron was one of the new wave novels of the late sixties, early seventies and has a place in sf history. Spinrad's shorter works were the best in the field but his novels, I thought, never reached the high quality of his short stories, but they are still worth reading."
5,Dreams Are Ten a Penny,"I owned a trailer from about 1983-1988, then sold it. Sometime in those five years I had purchased a cassette tape of Paper Lace with their big hit, The Night Chicago Died on it. I also fell in love with their sweet song, Dreams Are 10 a Penny. To my shock, when I sold and moved out of the trailer, I could not locate the cassette tape. Fast forward to 2005 when I decided to surf the Web for that tape and song on a CD, found it, and ordered it. And LOVED it! I don't know if Black Eyed Boys was not on the original cassette I had lost or I simply hadn't noticed it, but it is a dynamite song. Yes, the tape is fun, even with I Did What I did for Maria, of a distraught man who killed the man who murdered his beloved Maria. But there's Hitchin' a Ride, of a man desperate to get to his wife before she has their baby, and Happy Birthday Sweet Sixteen. I could go on and on, but really, if you want to listen to music that will make you sing, dance, and be happy, buy this CD."
4,great stuff,"This band has been very eclectic. Nick Talbot is the main person in the band here. This is the fourth record and it is evolved music. This is atmospheric heavy rock. The song ""Down River"" is much like Nick Cave in his best days. ""The Velvet Cell"" recalls some of the earliest Lou Reed tracks. ""Animals"" is smooth rock. It's very reminiscent of some shoegazer and folk records of the past twenty years. This band is very literary. ""Cities Beneath The Sea"" recall Edgar Allen Poe. ""See My Friends"" is a cover of a Kinks song. Gravenhurst comes across as a very moody and smart band. This is something worth checking out. I look forward to the live show. --I have just seen them live. They are something like Belle & Sebastian or Ballboy. Cool."
1,Flimsy,"The hardware on this halter is so chintzy I don't even want to put it on my horses for fear one spook will cause the metal to snap and expose sharp edges. Sure, it's inexpensive, but it's also useless."
2,Pony halters - Wrong size,"Although the size given on the halter was ""Pony"", this halter is far too large for my 36"" mini. I was very disappointed. To return costs $7.00 which is actually very reasonable, but the two halters I purchased only cost $8.00. So they will go into the yard sale I suppose."
3,GOOD VALUE but BEWARE of the Size,"I ordered this halter for my ""average-sized horse"" Bella. It was HUGE! We can't even make holes in it because the metal part will rub her face. There needs to be an exact sizing chart so that you don't have to guess at the size you should purchase. I searched everywhere on Google and could not find a sizing chart, so I ordered the ""horse"" size. I'm just going to keep this halter since I have to pay to send it back, and I'll purchase another one from a local store instead (although it will be more expensive).Even though the sizing was very wrong, the halter is a VERY GOOD VALUE for your money. It seems to be made really well, and I like the hook on the side. I just wish I could actually use it."
1,not worth the money,"bought this item for someone for christmas. Was just taken out of the box on 01/10/05. The first time using it, it started to smell of burning wires and started to spark. The unit no longer works now. Didnt even get one item to seal before it broke on me. Am now trying to get it replaced which is going to be another problem in itself. Would not reccommend."
1,Didn't leave us with good vibes,"My husband and I each have a fairly good sense of humour. So does our 3 year old. We love sharing books, especially funny ones. But this one didn't do it for us. In a home where we practise respect for each other while setting firm, loving boundaries, the mother in this book came across as weak, unfair, inconsistent towards, and contemptuous of her children. Not to mention far from being a fun, kind mom. We just got the impression she hated her life and her family. The concept had so much potential (don't we moms all need a break!), but this was very poorly delivered. Don't understand the positive reviews at all. These reviewers must not be exposed to very many good childrens books. There is nothing for us to enjoy about this book, aside from the artwork. It was a gift from my well-meaning mother-in-law, but we promptly passed it on."
2,They break easily,"This is a love-hate relationship.I bought my first set Oct 1, 2008 and loved it. All the comments above apply. The fact that they stay in my ear, hang around neck when not in use and the fabric cord cover....BUT...In March one channel stopped working. I contacted Rivit and they sent a replacement. I was happy again.Then I decided to buy a spare in case it happens again.Long story short...I was the proud owner of 5 (FIVE) DEAD earbuds and the company wasn't responding to my warranty requests for replacement.So, I took one apart to see if I could fix the problem (I said I liked the product, right?) Found the problem to be the wire connection at the plug. I've re-soldered mine and put a different strain relief on it and all is fine.One weak point on an otherwise fine product...own one if you can solder or know someone who can."
1,HORRIBLE SOUND QUALITY,THIS PRODUCT HAS NO BASS RESPONSE. USE IT ONLY FOR TALKING ON YOUR PHONE. THE SOUND QUALITY IS SO POOR I COULDN'T STAND LISTENING TO MY IPOD.
2,Not as good as the original Apple equip.,"I bought these to replace my original apple iPhone headphones and was disappointed. They have a design which requires you to wrap the cord around your neck and attach the phones to your ears. I find this difficult to do and not easy to do 'on the go'. It's also difficult to wear these with a backpack / jacket on as your clothing can pull at the cord and the fact that the wires are wrapped around you makes it that much more difficult to straighten out, especially when the phones are tugging at your ears.I am going to order a set of original Apple earphones to replace these. I've noticed they block more noise than the original Apple ones because of their design in-ear, but I think the difficulty of using these outweighs that benefit. Some may really love these though."
2,Shoddy construction,"I've already gone through two pairs of these and I don't think I will go for a third. The first pair died on the first day I wore them, when I stepped on the right earbud. My second pair lasted a little longer, but I had the same problem as many others - something went loose near the plug connector which caused the right earbud to stop working completely.I like the lanyard design which positions the microphone in a good location when worn correctly, and the button is easily findable and pushable. But the sound quality of the earphones (when they work at all) is not great and the earbuds are a little uncomfortable when compared to the V-Modas."
2,Wait about 30 days.,"Wait about 30 days. You'll loose sound out of one ear, or the mic and mic button will stop working.I'm on my second set and amazon won't take another replacement.They're great earbuds in theory. Good Sound, blocks out noise. I like the over the head. But the Quality of the wires make this a poor buy.I do like them, when it works. but it breaks too easilyUnfortunately they're the only IPhone earbuds under $20 I've seen at Amazon.I may buy these again, but with the replacement warranty."
3,Works great with Iphone,"it is a good product but my sole reason to buy it was that it shud work with iphone, which it did not, so 3 stars.If someone wants to buy it as a cheap earphone with some noise canceling, it is a good product to put money in...Update: Not sure, if I was doing something wrong or what, it is working great with iphone and the button works as home button. Like, I set 'home button' to start ipod.This button start and also skips the songs... I am loving it. it do some noise canceling as it goes in ear canal and also sound quality is good for 9 bucks (which i paid for this) :)unluckily, I cannot make stars 3 to 4. It should be given 4 stars, when I am getting what I was looking for..."
5,JASON IS FANTASTIC,THIS MUSIC IS DIFFERENT AND IT IS AN OLD TIME FAVORITE I CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR MORE ALBUMS THAT JASON HAS MIXED. I LOVE THIS ALBUM AND ALWAYS WILL . YOU GOTTA GET THIS ALBUM ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC
2,good for the beginner,"This home door gym is not a terrible piece of equipment, nor is it the best. For someone just beginning a work out, or looking for a piece that keeps them active from time to time, this is not a bad place to start. But, for the serious trainer, you will out perform this piece of equipment quickly. There are multiple levels of resistance, but not as many as other elastic band trainers. There are better products out there that offer more resistance, and are more tuned for the serious work out and resistance trainer. Other gym systems like Bodylastics set are a better products and offer a greater longevity of usage."
5,It is a great choice if you have DSL wireless at your home.,"I bought a 2.4GHZ phone before this one, it couldn't work because the wireless internet. So I returned that and bought this one. It works great. Powerful and simple."
1,Reliability MINUS,"I loved the features of this phone system, and for a while they worked great. I owend 3 handsets. One by one the screens went blank and then they started to not find the base. NOTE: mine were remanufactured, so maybe a new one is fine, Nevertheless it left a bad taste in my mouth for Panasonic phones. Buyer beware."
4,Visceral Female Blues.....,"....this girl rocks with.. ""Blues Power!"" A tight rhythm section, great guitar counterpoint and of course raw, yet somehow tempered (obviously years of performance and rehearsal)..""in your face"" vocals that'll reach down and grab your short n' curlys {curlies?} ...and NOT let go! MS. Peebles will give ya religion! Owwwwww!"
4,Excellent historical perspective and still relevant today,"Very interesting book for it's historical perspective (it's based on lectures given in 1938). Lynd argues that values must be considered in academics, and that values should guide our choice of research. He also calls on tenured faculty to take the initiative to oppose those forces which would constrain the freedom to work on issues that would improve human lives. Excellent read and still relevant today."
4,Great adjunct to the text... all about diagnosis,"A little tough to follow at first with the organization, but I have warmed up to this reference text quite well. It does a great job of outlining different nursing diagnoses and associated conditions, teaching needs, plan components, etc. As this should be a quick-reference manual to keep for a lifetime, an indestructible cover, reference tabs, and a little better flow/ organization would be exceptionally appreciated."
1,"Nice Product, but expensive for a disposable unit","I purchased two of these, thinking they would be great to just leave on as I motor to a spot and then jump up on the front deck to fish. As advertised they did exactly as I wanted to - however - humidity makes them go off easily and the little green pins always break way to easily as well. At $20 for the rearm kit, it can get expensive. The most disturbing thing is they are disposable. By that I mean if you happen to get a pin hole leak in one, it is now junk, it cannot be repaired and there is no replacement inner section for them. I have had them a couple short years and take really good care of my stuff, seems weird that it just developed a leak this easily. I am going back to the traditional life vests, can't keep throwing $200 away every couple of years."
2,"Good, but no bonus","This is a fantastic CD and all, but although the Anniversary Edition (AVSA9821) it doesn't include the ""10 Years After"" (Dix Ans Apres) bonus CD. I got a remastered single 16-song disc, the same one I bought years ago. Buyer take note."
4,Watch out for this one!,"There is something to be said about fake documentaries, especially if they're done well: This Is Spinal Tap, Blair Witch, etc. This one beats them all. Shocking, funny, you find yourself laughing and feel guilty about it later on. A movie is supposed to illicit some type of feeling in a person. A movie making you feel guilty about an emotional response is remarkable, and speaks volumes about emotions in general.(...)This movie is very entertaining and will have you thinking about it for months after watching. Too bad it's not on DVD.Maybe later on."
5,watch this with your kids,"You can teach a person a lot with this movie. The main character is a killer, but he does it because it's his job. He is also a musician, family man, and good patron at the local bars. My point is, people who are homicidally inclined don't have to be demented, delusional, or patriotic-- they can simply be earning a living."
4,last i think,"I dont know if this is the last film in the series or not. im pretty sure another one may come out. Anyways, this movie really wasn't scary if you know what I mean. It was gory. If you think blood, gore, and people being crushed is ""scary"" this movie is for you. It didn't scare me at all. Maybe because it had such good effects that it just wasn't scary. It was good though. Janet Leigh and Jamie Lee Curtis (janet's daughter) star in this film. It's a whole new creation :)"
4,Pretty Good,"Hmmm...what can I say...it was good once it got going...I think that Jamie Lee and the cast did a bang up job, portraying their charectors. It could have had a little more action to it though. All in all it was great!"
5,He's Back...Try To Live.,"This movie is an absolute masterpiece. Filled with so many twists and turns. It made me want more! Michael Myers is back and scarier than ever in this slam-dunk, begging for more slasher! Laurie Strode had moved away and changed her name so her brother wouldn't find her, but he's back, and living is no longer an option for the students at a private school in California. Definitely an A+ and I would recommend buying this DVD if you haven't gotten it already!"
3,NOT TOO SCARY,"HALLOWEEN H20 IS NOT AS SCARY AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. DON'T GETE WRONG IT IS A GGOD. JAMIE LEE CURTIS DIDN'T PLAY THE PART TOO GOOD, BUT LL COOL J DID GOOD. HE AINT' REALLY CUT OUT FOR THE ACTIN BUSINESS, BUT HE DID AIGHT."
5,"After four terrible sequals, this fan is thrilled!","I saw the original Halloween when I was five, and I have been a fan of the series since. I saw the other sequals, and with the exception of the second film, none of them did justice to the first. H20, however, finally closed the series with greatness. Jamie Lee Curtis' acting is excellent. The supporting cast gave the film the strength it needed to close the series out as best it could. The newly remastered theme music by John Carpenter gave indicated to me that I was not to be disappointed. To any fans of the series who have not seen H20, see it tonight, and if you are a DVD owner, just wait until its release. I have seen a sneak preview of the DVD version, and it is well worth any price."
2,Can't Believe It's A Movie,"I was happy when I found out that ""Halloween"" was getting another sequel. I stopped watching the series around the 5th movie. The 3rd movie was a joke and the ones following was more like ""Jason"" instead of the stalker we all know and love. I was not able to see H20 in the theater but I did rent it, and I was not impressed. The story and the plot fell apart very quickly. Laurie (as usual) stormed back to force Mike to get her instead of her son. The movie tried to be similiar to the first movie at the end when Laurie told her son and his girlfriend to run away. She was going to try and stop Micheal herself. Please, they could have been more original. I liked the base of the story, and LL Cool J was funny (mainly his girlfriend on the phone), but the movie could have had a better plot, dug more into her depression and more into where Micheal was. The movie felt very rushed, and that was a major turnoff."
4,WAY BETTER THAN RESERECTION,"this film was very good compared to most of the other sequals and definelty better than the latest halloween ( reserection). this movie makes reserection look like garbage - i am very happy with this film and all of the other's except reserection. this movie takes place 20 years after the first halloween and laurie strode thinks shes safe now and protected and shes living with her 17 or 18 yr old son and as halloween approuches she totally forgets at first then remembers and when she does its to late - micheal came home again and is after her and her son.- very scary and good performances by josh hartnett ,ll cool j and jamie lee curtis. also a very good and suprising ending, i recomend you buy or rent this but any haloween fan should buy this for thier collection."
3,HUH,I found this movie both dull and stupid. It was the end for Michael which is ver sad. I enjoy movies with a lotta blood. Compared to i9 know what you did last summer this one totally bombed. the 3 stars are for jamie's awesome acting.
3,Not scary,"As other people said, this movie is not scary at all. Mainly because we know that Jamie Lee will not be killed. I was a bit surprised that a relatively popular actor, a boy in ""The 3rd Rock from the Sun"", was killed instantly, though. Recommended only for Jamie Lee fans."
2,WHY CANT WE SEE MICHEAL MYERS FACE?WHERES HE BEENfor20 yrs,"Routine, boring, unfeasable, money grabbing. We dont see Micheal's face and he still never says a word or says why hes psychotic.A Good film for insomnia"
2,HUH?!,"I just couldn't believe it. Halloween 6 was all about him trying to get a baby, and now, he changes his mind and goes out for her sister? what is that? By far one of the worst movies I've ever seen, this movie doesn't even deserve a rental."
3,I saw the movie in the previews right before I came!,"I thought the movie was okay. But most of the time, the actors just had no common sense. Like when the security guard walks out to see what was going on, what an IDIOT. Also, when Curtis went after Michael, seriously you would have been running your cheeks out of town. The ending was THE STUPIDEST thing I have ever seen out of any movie. How retarded. It was supposed to be a suspence thriller, last time I checked that meant long and KEEPING you on the edge of your seat, not getting you there so you can get up to leave."
3,HALLOWEEN H2O MAKES YOU SCREAM OR MAKES YOU BORED?,"ANYBODY COULD HAVE MADE A MUCH BETTER SEQUEL IN THERE OWN IMAGINATION THAN WHAT WAS CAPTURED ON FILM HERE IN THE HALLOWEEN H2O DVD. THE DVD BOX, AND EVEN THE SYNOPSIS OF THE DVD IS DECIEVING, BECAUSE THERE ARE NO THEATRIACAL TRAILERS THAT ARE INCLUDED ON THIS DVD, NOR IS THERE ANY COMMENTARY BY THE CAST AND OR CREW OF THE MOVIE. THE MAIN REASON THAT I HAD PURCHASED THIS DVD MOVIE IS BECAUSE OF THE ""CREED VIDEO"" OTHER WISE KNOWN AS ""WHAT'S THIS LIFE FOR"" THAT IS INCLUDED ON THE DVD. IF PERHAPS THEY WHERE TO EVER MAKE ANOTHER HALLOWEEN MOVIE, MAYBE THEY COULD BASE IT MORE AROUND THE MYTH OF HALLOWEEN, OR HOW HALLOWEEN CAME TO BE. WELL THAT IS ENOUGH FOR NOW I HOPE!"
4,actually pretty good...,"I think this was one of the best Halloween movies. Jamie Lee Curtis runs rampid....not in the hospital, but all around! it wasnt really scary, but it was funny and good.If you love Jamie Lee, then dont see Halloween Reserection... its really bad since JLC dies in the first 5 minutes...."
5,WICKED,"Though i'm not a big fan of sequels, Michael Myers is just the kind that can keep coming back and still be scary. I loved this movie, especially how it ended. If you haven't seen any of the Halloween sequels, you should at least open your mind to this one."
2,OK Halloween offering,"In 1981 after 'Halloween II', Jamie Lee Curtis anounced that she will never do another horror film again but in 1998, she had a meeting with John Carpenter to make another Halloween movie since it has been 20 years since 'Halloween I' was released. She also said that this time she wanted to kick Michael Myers's. The film has some funny bits and it's nice to see Curtis's old charactor, Lauri Strode come back on the screen for the third and last time but after a while the film falls flat on it's face when everything goes wrong."
4,"Good, but could be better","One can get tired of the ""slash-em-up"" style. Needed more element of surprise and suspense instead of straight-forward murder."
1,Absolutely terrible Blu-ray release from Echo Bridge.,"Do not suppourt Echo Bridge with your money. If you absolutely need this on Blu-ray, get the Halloween trilogy released by Alliance in Canada. It's region 1, it has a DTS master audio soundtrack and it preserves the original aspect ratio. This version of H20 has an ""open matte"" widescreen presentation, which, in fact, shows MORE picture information than the 2.35:1 theatrical release, it doesn't preserve the intended style of the film."
1,Sorry...,"Lets get this straight, I'm a long time Halloween fan and take it from me, this sequel does not do any justice to the previous ones, save for 3 and 6. I really thought that Miner was on to something during the first half. There were some scary scenes and I enjoyed the classic slashing Michael uses to pick the kids but as soon as Jamie discovers that he's after her, the movie just loses it. Everything becomes predictable, dumb, fake and not scary whatsoever. I did like Janet Leigh's cameo appearance though. I can almost compare Curtis to Linda Hamilton in Terminator...in the original, she was shy and innocent, then later she appears as tough and fearless...it least it worked in T2. I particularly found it dumb when she was calling Michael's name looking for him...come on! He ain't stalking her, she's stalking him! All said, this COULD have been done better."
1,Worst Sequel Ever!!!!,"Bad Plot. A Brand new (Sqeaky clean) Michael Mask. C-List Actors. If There Were a 0 Rating, That's what it would of got. Worst Halloween in the Series, Besides part 3. Then again, part 3 Wasn't about Michael. The Decapitation scene was the Crappiest death ever. Where was the blood? Dimension didn't give this movie a budget at all. If you read this, Do Not Buy this Movie!!!Terrible Sequel."
3,It's decent.,"I'm sort of ""blah"" about this film. I don't hate it, but I don't particularly like it. I suppose it's alright, but it's definitely a Scream ripoff and designed to appeal to the mainstream. Jamie Lee Curtis returns, which is a highlight, though the absence of the late Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis is greatly felt."
4,The final entry in the true 'Halloween' trilogy . . .,"There have been a lot of 'Halloween' films, and no doubt there will be many more. But only three of them carry the spirit of the original, and only three tell the core story of the saga.'Halloween,' the classic original.'Halloween II,' picking up right where the first leaves off and setting the stage for . . .'Halloween H2O,' echoing the first two, and bringing the original story arc to a close.All the other films are purely exploitative. Films three through six wander all over the place and are completely gratuitous in terms of violence, gore and illogic. Number eight should never have been made, undoing all that H2O accomplished, much as 'Alien III' so severely undermined James Cameron's 'Aliens.'I, II and H2O. Stop right there. Do not pass GO, do not collect $200 -- and enjoy a classic horror/suspense trilogy as John Carpenter intended, made in the tradition of Hitchcock."
1,Missing features and a non anamorphic transfer!,"Buena Vista has once again supplied a horrendous package. This movie does NOT contain a commentary track as noted on the box, nor is there a DTS track. If you absolutly have to have the movie, the transfer is not bad for a non-anamorphic. but the misleading advertising (from BV, not amazon's fault),and the cost are serious things you want to consider"
2,Josh Hartnett is sohot!,the only good part of his movie was Jsh Hartnett. He's a hottie. Don't waste your money.
4,READ Before You Buy!,"Lucky I'm a HUGE Lettering and Calligraphy Lover (in addition to wedding invitations). This is a fantastic resource if you're looking for a book to show you some fun, funky and elegant calligraphy ideas. In my opinion, the title is misleading because it's definitely more of a cool calligraphy / handwriting book (although there are definitely some cute invitations in there, too.) Had I not been a calligraphy lover, I probably would have returned the book, but since I'm always looking for fun new styles of calligraphy, I found this to be a great book. I would describe this more of a modern, fun calligraphy book with a few invitation ideas. I really like how it shows you, step by step, how to do each lettering style."
1,Don't be Fooled by the positive reviews!!,"I recently graduated college with a Business degree, and have started reading ""career help"" books to give me a leg up on the corporate ladder. Well this book was a complete joke and a total waste of money. First off, this book is very outdated. While most of the information may have been relevant ten years ago, it is common sense today. Also, while casually reading the book I discovered well over 10 typos that were easy catches. Here's an idea: learn to communicate effectively and that's how you can thrive in the work place! Please don't waste your time on this one, you will be severely disappointed."
1,False Advertising,"So based on the photo at the web site, I believed the seat to be blue, gold and purple. Turns out it is green, yellow and pink and looks garish. I had ordered two and only one arrived....hope I can get my money back since I do not want two of these monstrosities"
3,Julia France,"Gertrude Atherton was nothing if not an ambitious writer. No subject or setting seemed beyond her powers. This book is a long, episodic novel about Julia Edis: her marriage to the monstrous Lt. France, heir to a dukedom; dull years spent in England; her escape from her tyrannical husband; her becoming a suffragette (a favorite Atherton theme); and her eventually falling in love with Daniel Tay. It was bold for its day (another Atherton trait), but she was not able to draw Julia France in such a way that she remains in our memory for long. All that she suffers, all that she does to give meaning to her life, evaporates almost as quickly as it takes to turn the page."
3,Average,"An average mystery, likely because this is the author's first effort in the series. Certain parts seemed draggy. Some clues were not shown to the reader and narrated only at the point of revelation. This minimised the reader's ""Why didn't I think of that before?!"" impact. I'm still game for another book by Mr. Dexter."
5,pretend there is a cnn crew in the 60's following the war,"THIS IS A UNIQUE CREATION OF HISTORY IN THE FORM OF A ""CREATED"" DOCUMENTARY.I HAVE SEEN IT TWICE IN THE LATE 60'S AND WAS STRUCK BY THE IMPARTIALITY OF THE WORK. THE ALGERIAN PEOPLE USED THE MEANS AT HAND TO WAGE A WAR OF LIBERATION"
3,Text-to-Speech DISABLED,BOYCOTT all publishers who request the disabling of Text-to-Speech. While this book is fantastic the publisher obviously is NOT!!!
3,Maybe it's just me...,"But this audio version of Don Quixote wasn't enjoyable.The Basics: This is a three hour abridgment of Don Quixote read by actor and stage performer Michael York. Don Quixote is the Spanish classic written by Miguel de Cervantes. It's the story if a disenchanted nobleman who takes on the persona of a Knight in a quest to find love and glory. The real work is much deeper than the popularized versions of this story, which is unfortunate. This is read well byt he talented Miachael York, but isn't nearly as entertaining as it could have been. It just seems to fall flat. Running time 3 hours."
1,Font Makes This Edition Unreadable,"Great book, great publisher (my favorite for quality and hand-holdability), but the font heremakes it nearly unreadable. PLEASE, Everyman, change the font and I'll buy another one."
2,The most overrated of all the classics,"The only portion of this novel that is ever mentioned is the ""tilting at a windmill"" episode, which takes place in the first 20 or so pages of this 1000 page bore. I suspect most readers never got much farther. The protagonist, who is often spoken of as a long-suffering man on a noble quest who preserves his dignity in the face of numerous misfortunes, is actually nothing of the kind. He is a mean-spirited old crackpot who perpetrates repeated acts of violence against innocent people and who is deservedly trounced every time. The main character is offensive, the plot is thin, the story much too drawn out, and the style dull. The book was actually meant to be a satire of the romance novels of the day, but its intent is lost in the excess of its verbosity. Were it not for its few moments of humor, I would rate it a zero."
3,Blues Harmonica Collection,Really great tab. The only thing I wish it had is a CD so you would not have to chase all the music. The music is a must to have with this book. This book is not for beginners.
1,Junk,I received model MC2-GV as a gift. It broke after one roll of film. Company will not honor warranty because it was a gift and I have no receipt. Stay away.
5,Great Scouting Camera 4 An Wildlife Fan,"The previous review on this page is for a different series camera so I'm not sure what it is doing on this page. After testing out this camera, it took great quality pictures, had a strong flash, and was accurate on timing for pictures. Would make a great scouting camera for a hunter or a wildlife fan."
2,GOOD ENOUGH,"This being about the only Dakota-English dictionary still in print makes it good enough. But there are a lot of words you will not find in here, and forget about help for which tenses to use. It is limited, often frustrating, but it is the only one. I also had to purchase the English-Dakota dictionary, because for some ridiculous reason (most dictionaries provide both (Forgein Language)-English & English-(Forgein Language)translations in ONE book) this dictionary only goes one way, so you have to buy another one to get the rest! Annoying & Expensive!"
4,Looks like Oreos,"This item was a welcome addition to my household. It is one of the best store bought wheat free cookies available. It could never compete with the real OREO, but for wheat-free diets it is the best there is. The cookie part is a little harder but at least it doesn't crumble like most Gluten-free items. The mint adds the perfect touch."
5,Relaxation Plus!,I had rented this DVD from the library and had to have a copy of my own. It has helped ease those late nights when I can't sleep and calm my mind.
4,What a birth,"Eyedea is by far my favorite rapper and it is because he is not afraid to take chances in his music. On his debut album he wows with his lyrical ability, while also having important messages laced in his songs. ""void (internal theory)"", ""On this I stand"" ""Liquid Sovergnty"", and ""music music"" and ""void (external theory)"" are the biggest standouts. Eyedea keeps it intersting throughout the album and you never know what he is going to talk about next. The only drawback of the album is the beats are a bit weak, and some of the production is not that good on a couple of the songs. Nonetheless this a strong debut effort from Eyedea and Abilites and their next album ""E&A"" shows the strides both men have made."
3,SO SO,"I love speedy J, I listen to G spot almost every day and I cann't get enough. This album though was a little strange and I didn't like it that much."
3,Not so shocking,"long grooves and all to speedy j, but this new album shows age is not all it cracked up to be. underworld kept working at it, but it seemed like speedy j didn't put much into this album so maybe i should just stick to the singles of his that i like... he's not like richard james (thank god) but i still want the old jay back......"
3,Cute little gadget....NOW WHAT?,"OK......My sis and I send each other little kitchen gadgets all the time....usually included in birthday or Christmas gifts. Heres the deal.....My sis sent me this Burton Poultry Thermometer, and it is really cute, but.........I dont know how to use it. My son and family were here recently, and needed to check a Beer Can Chicken.......although we used the thermometer, we didnt know what to look for. Is there a DEMO of this cute, but so far Worthless product? I would have given a higher rating, if I knew how the gall danged thing worked! HELP!"
5,"ohne Frage, sehr gut","Dieser Film ist wirklich wundervoll. Er vermittelt eine zauberhafte Stimmung und ist ist auch von der schauspielerischen Qualität einwandfrei. Über die Verfilmung historischer oder literarischer Stoffe kann man sich streiten. Oft ist eine freie Interpretation im Film besser. Hier, bei diesem Meisterwerk, stimmt alles."
2,"Very powerful saw, but burnt up within a week","I used a recip saw(sawzall) for hours every day at my last job to cut through 2"" diameter copper cables. We had the basic cheapie model Dewalt at first and that thing was a good saw, worked well for over a year and a half before it finally burnt up, so we upgraded to the 12 amp HD model, this saw was a beast, cut through the cables like a hot knife through butter but unfortunately only lasted about 4 days before it was inoperable. Dewalt makes some really good tools and they also put out a lot of junk, seems there quality control isn't what it should be. If you're in the market for a recip saw I would highly recommend another brand, my personal saw is a Makita that I've had for around 10 yrs and still works just as well as the day I bought it, if I had to buy another it would definitely be a Makita, Bosch or the original Milwaukee Sawzall."
5,Better than Hornblower,"Unlike Forrester O'Brian has really done his homework. His books are really informative.Forrerster follows the straight Tory ticket and O'Brian, does not.Of course the Hornblower series started in the thirties when England still had an empire. The Aubrey/Mathurin series on the other hand started in 1969 when England had lost its empire and democracy had become respectable."
4,I'll be coming back for more!,"This entry in the Aubrey-Maturin seagoing saga was probably my least favorite that I've read so far in this series. My quibble was with the novel's plot, which was pretty thin and derivative of other action novels and movies. And Diana Villiers, Dr. Maturin's love, is starting to remind of the character of Irenee in The Forsythe Saga. Everyone is always talking about how fascinating she is, but darned if I can see why. On the plus side, as always O'Brian serves up amazing historical details and makes Jack and Stephen witty and real. And the on-going story of their lives advances to a very eye-opening and surprising ending. So you can bet I'll look forward to the next installment of this series."
2,Hustle volume 1,"The video provides several dance patterns from beginners to advance. This video teaching lesson could be better if each lesson will have several repetition. Also the music used is always the same music. If several variation of music were used, it would be nice. This makes me feel it is a 2 star rating."
4,diabetes for dummies,This book breaks down the nutritional aspect of controlling the sugars and starches in ones diet. Most understandable.
2,"""Ironically Very Difficult To Digest""","I'm not sure why this book is categorized on Amazon as a 'Disorders and Disease' book, considering it barely covers any pathology at all. A far better choice is 'Diabetes and You: A Comprehensive, Holistic Approach.' Save your money and get a real medical book that doesn't consider you, the reader, a dummy. You'll be glad you did."
3,"This Movie is a True Classic, but......","Ever since I was a little kid I have loved this movie. The story is fluid, the fight scenes are brutally entertaining, costumes and sets are top notch and best of all that adrenaline rushing soundtrack. Which brings me to the reason I gave one of my favorite movies a three instead of a deserving five. This DVD is in mono. Which begs the question, what the heck were they thinking. If you want this movie because you love it,by all means buy it. If you want to feel that music pound through you with the power of DVD, I would wait until it is re-released in a deserving sound setup. Hopefully the studios will realize their folly. Just remember this movie is FIVE stars itself, but the DVD is only worthy of a three."
4,CONAN NEVER LOOKED BETTER!!,"This trend setting fantasy epic captured Robert E. Howard's Hyborian Age magnificently.It spawned a massive wave of cheap sword and sorcery knock off's and made the perfectly cast Arnold a worldwide box office star.Director/writer John Milius strips down some of the more fantastical and supernatural aspects of the Conan mythos ( Abundant in Oliver Stone's original script) but still delivers a full blooded, rip roaring adventure.The move is helped immeasurably by Ron Cobb's eye popping production design, which is truly breathtaking.And Basil Poledouris' score is a thunderous, rousing classic.In fact it's the old fashioned spectacle of Conan, it's authenticity and sheer scale in pre CGI days, that makes it such a pleasure to watch today.Given the extreme tanking of the 2011 remake, the old adage has never been more true: the original is still the best!"
3,Out of an age undreamed of comes CONAN,"CONAN THE BARBARIAN is the kind of film that you really don't know what to make of at first, because the dialouge and plot transitioning is so overly elaborate and exotic, it makes the plot hard to follow. Plus, the amount of nudes and sex in CONAN would make BASIC INSTINCT look like..... no wait, it wouldn't. But there's plenty of bare female flesh to go around to both horny little high school juniors as well as masochitic lesbians.CONAN traces the the life of (duh) mystic warrior Conan (Arnold Schwarzenner) as he seeks revenge upon his parents murderers. He must also rescue the daughter of a king from the clutches of a malevolent snake wizard (James Earl Jones).If you want to rent CONAN or but it, that's cool. While not as good as THE SCORPION KING, which starred pro-wrestler Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson in place of Arnold, had more action, was set in the middle east, and had a more coherent and fun plot, CONAN is still pretty good. So check it out."
4,Hugely enjoyable fantasy actioner,"Dispite a slow start, virtually no humour and being rather muddled, this is still an excellent fantasy actioner for adults. Arnie's as wooden as a wardrobe, but who cares? He's got the body for the role and doesn't say that much anyway. Direction, music and production design are all top notch, James Earl Jones is a wonderfully evil bad guy and the plot has enough thrust to keep you watching.The superb and bloody fight sequences are big highlights."
5,Why did they edit the dvd???,Buyers beware! this is an edited version of the original! Around 18 minutes are missing in the dvd version!!!! USA version at least.
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"Though it doesn't have 5.1 Dolby Digital, it still sounds amazing on DVD. The video transfer is beautiful, no artifacts whatsoever on the transfer. Anamorphic widescreen is wonderful on this DVD. The best parts of this disc are the deleted scenes, the bonus footage, and ""Conan Unchained; the making of Conan"". Absolutely wonderful extras. For fans of this movie, your DVD collection is not complete without it."
1,I want the orignal ending,"I love this movie, but I give this release one star because it does not allow me to watch the movie as I originally saw it in the movie theater. I have no problem with a director's cut, but it was not made clear on the item when I purchased it (there weren't all these reviews at the time) that you could only see the ending the way it was originally planned. Most times, you have a choice between watching it in the original theatrical release, or the alternate way. ""Collector's Edition"" with ""Extra Scenes"" does not usually mean without the original ones.Rent this one first. If you like the alternate ending, get it. If you liked the original ending, you may not want to bother. I wish I hadn't.I kick myself for not watching the ""Collector's Edition"" before getting rid of my 1998 version. That was stupidity to the extreme on my part."
4,Take a trip,One of Theroux's best train trips. You can really feel the shifting landscapes as he moves through the latitudes...
3,Paul Theroux always tends to be negative. It gets old.,Paul Theroux has undoubtedly had the opportunity to travel to some beautiful and exciting places. It's just burdensome to have to slog through his adventures when they are invariably projected in a negative and detogatory way. Having been to many of the places he describes it's hard to relate to the pain and anguish he continues to wallow in.Too bad bill Bryson doesn't get off the beaten path more often. That said Bill's walk in the woods is a great read.
4,going in the new found direction,"i just picked up a copy of nfg's newest cd ""catalyst"". it has a really good sound to it that carries on from ""sticks and stones"" and even from their self titled. all downhill from here is probably my favorite track but doubtfull and at least I'm known for something are really good 2. its still the same whiney nfg u gotta love and the songs grow on u after a few listens. also, the songs r more upbeat than the last albums. if u like the direction nfg is going ull love this cd. overall a good cd thats worth the buying."
5,Catalyst ROCKS!,"New Found Glory's new cd, Catalyst, is awesome! I've been jamming to it since I bought it...everyone should buy it cuz its great!"
2,Ughhhhhhhh,"Its a stretch giving this CD 2 stars. I've seen some of the comments here, and ""more mature lyrics"" don't necessarily make for a better CD. This dissapoints because this album holds absolutley zero emotional energy. I've listened through about 3 times now, and not a single song has caught my ear. This is New Found Glory, its supposed to be pop music? And whats with all the lousy metal riffs? The only thing that saves this CD from one star are the few decent ""slow"" songs. Maybe the problem is that the band lacks direction as its tried to move away from the cookie cutter mold of pop punk music all about girls. I think you're crazy if you think this is better than any of their previous releases. I'll stick with the emo genius of ""Nothing Gold Can Stay"" and the pop brilliance of ""New Found Glory"" thank you very much."
2,Its 'ite,"The cd is alright. The first two songs on the album are definitely the only highlight and from there it just goes ""downhill."" The voice of the lead singer is definitely getting old and annoying and it seems that they have somewhat stepped out of the punk genre and gotten a little heavier. The only think louder than the music is Jordan's voice."
1,"Please Jordan ,stop singing for music's sake dude!","Ugh! Jordan cannot sing, if his life depented on it. First of all, this isnt punk--- to all t.r.l. idiots, who do not know bands like dk, or pennywise, or, bad religion , ok ? Nfg , simply plays backstreetboys songs with guitars, and no, its not punk but simply gay at best! I actullie sat down and gave nfg's ""catalyst"" a listing, and no punk sound is to be found in here, at all. Stay away from goodcharlotte,blink182, avril,nfg,story of the year,yellowcard, and anything mtv plays or what is shown on trl! Can some one put a sock over Jordan's mouth while he attempts to sing ? Pls! I still have a head ache from his annoying voice. Yes, i do deserv tho--for listining to this poser bullsh*t! Skip it."
1,Welcome to the 80's metal scene!,"you idiot teenagers make me sick by perpetuating the release of crap such as this. don't you know how to think for yourselves? new found glory, sugarcult, lostprophets; whatever. these bands all sound exactly alike and equally stupid. they are nothing more than the next wave of absurd corporate rock, no different than warrant, trixter and firehouse were in the 80s.simply pathetic. no stars. no talent. no originality."
4,They are at it again,"compared to their first three albums this on is A-O.K. powerful guitar chords, great use of keyboards, and the back up vocals on a few of the tracks is good too. one thing though, if you want a better new found glory i suggest self titled or sticks and stones. but truely not a bad cd"
5,NFG's on Fire!,"I dont know where to start. I've been a loyal fan of New Found Glory since Sticks and Stones came out and I've got to say...they dont disappoint. Of course, they have matured which is always not only a good sign but a good thing. The guitar riffs and drums are awesome! I bought the CD the day it came out and I've probably already listened to it at least twenty times straight through. It's an awesome album and if you like NFG or just want something catchy and meaningful to listen to, this is the CD for you!"
4,"GEt OvER It, YOuR PoP PuNK iS HerE 2 Stay!","Listen up all you punks! Don't down this CD at all! If you would get up off your a**'s and give the new NFG CD a chance then you might enjoy it. I'm so tired of people always saying that the sound had changed and its not emo anymore. Let me tell you something you grow over the years. NFG grew over the years, you may not like it...but many other people do. The sound may have changed from emo to pop punk. But if you take a good look around you then you will see what the pop punk is all about these day. Yeah its annoying, I will give you that one. But so many bands are simple trying to break away from that pop punk image but not matter how you like they soon will end up somewhere along the lines of pop punk. NFG has excepted it and moved on, so should you."
4,Catalyst,"I bought this cd because I've liked NFG for a couple years and have all of their cds. This one is really good. They have a new sound which is a little different and kinda hard to get used to, but after listening to it a few times, I love it! I have all of the songs memorized already. The best song is ""All Down Hill From Here""."
3,Meh,"If there was one word to describe this CD it would be ... unoriginal. I originally liked ""Failure's Not Flattering"" and when I got the CD, but the fun wore out fast. Then I liked ""I Don't Wanna Know"", but I saw the music video for that one that they just put out and it just RUINS the whole song. The other songs are just okay, but I just feel like I can't listen to it the whole way through without getting bored. It's not that the music is bad or anything, it's just... repetitive. I say get Sticks and Stones (one of NFG's old CDs) instead of this one.. it's more enjoyable."
3,I doubt students using this text can tackle dynamics,"I doubt students using this text will be as capable in tackling dynamics problems as one would assume. Give the Physics student fed on a regular diet of this book one of those swirling, mechanical-arm problems and they'll probably be dead in the waters. This is probably one of those books that create the illusion of mastery rather than develop real skills.Springer has a real good series on classical mechanics nowadays. That's my tip.Disclaimer: gave up on this book and never really used it, because I think it sucks and life is too short."
3,it gets the job done,"it starts off well enough, but the chaos chapter is terrible. I did use multiple sources while i was taking an analytic mechanics course. The best part of the book is the well assorted bunch of problems."
2,Pedagogical Nightmare,"This book would probably be good if you already knew the material...the authors' explanations are often extremely poor. They skip many steps in derivations using phrases like the dreaded ""it can be seen that"" when the logical steps involved are not at all obvious, and often try to introduce subjects using excessively formal mathematical notation that bogs down the physical insight. Sometimes their examples are decent, but this is the exception rather than the rule. If you have a bad teacher for your upper level classical mechanics course and are forced to rely on your textbook for self study and this is the one you're stuck with, you will be in trouble."
1,Propping up a coffee table,As the other reviews say this book is a 100% waste of money! For me it seems like the authors were just writing / speaking to here themselves speak. They also just give WAY to many examples of SGML and HTML for a history lesson - really zero actual examples of working XML. Also I found severl errors sprinkled across this text and I found myself always flipping back to see what these authors were talking about. The only good thing this book is good for is proping up a coffe table or keeping yourself warm next to a roaring fire as you use this book for fuel.
1,For HTML to XML,I was disappointed in this book. I felt that 90% of this book was comparing XML to HTML. XML is much more than an extended language of HTML. XML it is finding uses in all kinds of different environments and applications. This book may be great for web designers looking to XML for presenting information on the web.
2,Not very 'straightforward' at all....,"Unfortunately I lost interest after 7 days, and despite attempting to persist with the book quite a few times, I eventually gave up.The writing style pursued isn't enough to hold the reader's interest - it felt like it was all over the place, and it was hard at times to follow the authors' logic. The content also has quite a few gaps that require re-proofing.Unfortunately not recommended, especially with other books like XML By Example demonstrating what this book should have been."
1,Look to a different source to learn XML,"I have bought a number of Sams books and found most of them very instructive, but this book was a total waste of time and money. There's no logical pattern to learning XML presented in this text. Topics are scattered and there's no recognizable learning pattern. There are too many references to SGML and HTML, and too few XML hand-on examples. If you need to understand the history and similarities of XML to HTML and SGML, go ahead and buy this book. If you need to apply XML or need to develop a good understanding of it for future development, look into a book that walks you through the development of practical applications."
4,Great book for a textbook.,"This is an American Government textbook, no doubt about it. It is objective and unbiased and lacks an ideological agenda. It celebrates both conservatives and liberals, but at the same is critical of both for things they usually deserve. It is one of the few textbooks I have ever read that makes me think about whether conservatives are really conservative or liberals really liberal. They begin making you understand the ideologies and then proceed to show the problems in them and how that opens up politics to opportunists and even tyrants.All in all, highly recommended."
3,Diva's Demos with a nice picture,"If you already have ""Shout It Out', you won't want to buy this album. It's the same thing with a different picture on the cover. A nice photo of Donna from her early years. And if you love the song ""Nice To See you"" you could pick this album up. All these albums, ""Shout It Out', ""Gold', ""The magic Collection' are the same thing with different titles. But there are fans who'd rather hear Donna sing these demos than listen to her guest work with Liza Minnelli or Kiss. These demos are flooding the market and many fans collect them. you might enjoy this album if it's new to you."
5,Right Again,"Like when he was Mayor of Cranston, Steve Laffey sees problems and attempts to fix them. America needs serious and fundamental reform."
2,Starsky and Hutch,The movie was not worth the price.The quality of the acting and production was reminiscent of a Starsky and Hutch TV show.
1,Read This First!!,"I must admit I was rather excited when I found ""The Omega Man"" on DVD at my local video rental shop. Charlton Heston (""Planet of the Apes"", ""Ben Hur"") is a fantastic actor in general so imagine my surprise an hour into the film when I began to realize how utterly terrible this film really is.Now, ordinarily I'm the guy who loves movies everyone else hates (Pi, Trainspotting, Zardoz, etc) but there was just no saving this film. Aside from Heston, the acting is utterly horrid! The characters are straight from Joe Bob's drive-in theatre, and the one liners nail the coffin shut!If you like good movies...please..do not sacrifice 2 hours of your life that you'll never get back on this crapper!"
5,good movie,"Fits in with today's mood. A good movie, with some interesting views of how we would act if we were the last person on Earth."
3,Omega Man Lives on...,"While not a great movie, Omega Man can be enjoyed for several reasons. Charles Heston is always fun to watch, the photography / images are frequently compelling and the premise of the story is quite interesting. Adding to the enjoyment, at least for me, is that fact that several of the scenes are unintentionally hilarious! All in all, a movie worth watching and I would give it three and a half stars on the rating scale."
2,Omega Man,"Omega Man is pretty cheesy and dated: fake blood, bad costumes, laughable dialogue, and solidly anchored in the '70s. Vicent Price's ""Last Man on Earth"" is a superior version of ""I am Legend"" IMHO."
2,Omega - The Last Man,Omega Man was one of Charlton Heston's early movies. The part didn't require much skill and he came through. It was a simple little story that kept me entertained.
4,Classic Sci Fi,"Before watching Will Smiths ""I am Legand"" I watched Omega man again - I'd seen it as a teen and remembered liking it very much. It stands the test of time very well, and it's fun to look back at some of the things that existed back in the '70's - like pay phones.A lot of traditional values at war with each other - good vs evil, technology vs. religion, struggle to survive and find a cure for scientific research that destroys the world.Some parts of the movie are cheesy, but all in all, this is a very enjoyable movie that makes you think a bit, has a lot of action and is well worth watching again. It succeeds very well without all of the CGI effects that helped make ""I am Legend"" so popular. Definatley worth a rental."
2,Omega Man,This movie was the contributor of many a nightmare involving for some reason little persons in hoods climbing through my bedroom window. Charleton played his gun toting masoginist best. I think Los Angeles was better than New York. Good for its time.
2,Clever film - poor soundtracking,"Let me start out by saying that I was born in 1987, I love post-apocalyptic movies, and I was a film major. Take all as you will.This film was somewhat thought provoking, somewhat confusing, throughout. A lot of the 'horrors' are left unexplained, or else they receive fast explanations. The mixture of 70s lingo and cinematic cliches were hard to stomach at times. The role of race in the casting of the actors is almost unbearable.The soundtrack sucked. I wasn't alive when the music was recorded, but it seemed to me to be a grab-bag of pop culture musical styles from the era. The music constantly clashed with the mood of in the scenes, the acting, etc. I felt like the whole soundtrack was trying to seduce me into nasty hairy lovemaking, baby. This film came out the same year as Dirty Harry, and honestly, they could have been scored together.Charlton Heston, how you must have fallen from the grace that was Planet of the Apes... if you liked that movie."
3,Can You Dig It Baby?,"Yes it's cheesy and has aged very badly. But as others have pointed it that's part of it's appeal. In a strange way, with the return of gloom and doom, this movies dosen't seem so fantastic anymore. Like it did in the 80's and wealthy 90's.I like it as a window on the time period that it was made. People talked like that - well at least some did. The clothes, attitudes, politics everything. It's almost like watching an alternative Earth in which civilization was wiped out in the early 70's. It works and it still packs a wallop in it's own way.Personally I've always preferred the first edition of Stephen King's The Stand for that same reason. That novel was written in the mid-seventies. The revised edition that came out in 1989 din't work because he changed the dates and cultural references, but it's still obvious that it's a seventies novel. The Omega Man has not been changed. Just roll with it."
5,price is ridiculous,are you kidding me about the price of these? i love these but the amount charged isexorbant. much less expensive at grocery store or walmart.
5,"McCaffrey is a faze, youll grow out of it.","Dragonsdawn is McCaffrey's best, and the most sci fi oriented of the pern series(which is mainly fantasy). The Pern colonists are faced with the unforseen horror of ""thread"": a kind of macroscopic selfreplicating complex molecule that falls from the sky and eats anything organic. To fight ""thread"" they turn to gengeneering native lifeforms. The character interaction is superb, all of the characters come off as people, even the extra's. The tech requires no great suspension of disbeleif, and its a smooth read. I loved this book and have read most of Anne McCaffrey's work, which is all pretty much the same. Anne McCaffrey is great... and then you wake up and realize that these are kid's books and you start buying Mercedes Lackey books instead. McCaffrey's work is the TRAINING WHEELS of sc-fi/fantasy!"
2,Use only for basic wrenching around the house.,"Used these to break some bolts loose on my car, they broke. Certainly not ""impact"" worthy, maybe just for basic wrenching but that is all."
3,tools,Every guy needs these event if he never uses them. Makes him more of a man.. Increases the size of his........ego.
4,Can't beat the price,"So far these have performed as required, if they hold up than the price paid makes them quiet a steal. 4 stars because long term reliability can not be determined, but short term results are very good."
4,Useful portable tool,"This simple device is small enough to be carried with a laptop and makes it far easier to use. While the fully upright mode is best to use with an external keyboard, being too high to use the built-in keyboard, both of the other settings are quite comfortable for typing. I own three of these devices, one for travel, and one for each of my laptops at home. It's a workable, inexpensive solution."
3,"Lovely stuff, but...","... the lack of guitar makes this album plod rather heavily. I heard this and was unimpressed, but fortunately I moved right on to ""On To Evermore"" which is a much superior album.The keyboards are nice on this album, and there are some sweet melodies like ""Time Marches On"" but it just doesn't hang together and hold my interest."
3,For fans only,"A newcomer to Glass Hammer, this was the second album I acquired by the band. Having been pleasantly surprised by a later release, Chronometree, I expected more from this album, and at first thought it would deliver. The CD kicks off to a smashing start with the dreamy and melodic Time Marches On, a 9 minute epic driven by soaring keyboards and accentuated by lively bass riffs. As the last notes of the song faded away, I was ready to hand out a 5 star rating - but alas, it all goes downhill from here. Songs such as The Way To Her Heart, an awful love song that lacks any musical originality, and Felix the Cat, a keyboard adaptation of a classical piece (a la Rick Wakeman) had me cringing. The second half of the album sounds mostly like bad 1980s alt rock, and is saved only by the somewhat decent final track ""Heaven.""Perelandra may appeal to die-hard fans of Glass Hammer, but for those of discerning musical taste, my recommendation is to keep away."
4,Don't forget Harrison Ford!,"Harrison Ford does a wonderful job of bringing out Melania Griffith. Without him, this movie bombs. They play off of each others roles and turn this movie into a keeper. Now where is the DVD version?"
3,WHY SO MANY STAIRS???,"Clever plot, great direction, beautiful city skylines (sigh), but cmon Jack had to carry her THREE flights of stairs to his plush apartment??? So many scenes of stairs and climbing and the difficulty of reaching the top...OK I GET IT!!! Enough of this trite allegory and onto an elevator, that also rises and if crowded also takes a very long time to reach your destiny. For someone who wants so badly to be taken seriously you don't sleep with your business partner and continue to emphasize your curves vacuuming (albeit to audience only). Who in the world would take this breathy voiced, sultry vixen with anything other than disdain. For those of us who lived this culture and really did have to change wardrobes and boldness, this is an insult. Melanie is truly beautiful but the filmy makeup aged her. Loved Alec Baldwin, Joan Cusack, and Mr. Trask."
3,an office drudge to climber Cinderella story?,"This movie is a breaking down the glass ceiling movie about developing a profitable idea, getting it past the dragon lady boss,and finding Prince Charming. A Jersey side secretary puts in the hours, but gets no respect because humble origins; her Jersey boy friend is a ""snake""( her words).This is the 80's resurgence of the American Empire as a romantic comedy.Actually Melanie Griffith is more than a pretty face her,but the concept of a climber is not all that new.Doing an end run around the bad guy ( girl) , she gets the whole deal."
4,Fun for all ages!,"This game entertains all of my kids from age 3 to 12. Also, like all Arthur stories, the kids learn a good moral lesson through playing the game."
5,Reliamed TENS Electrodes,"I've used a lot of electrodes, and typically I would like to get7 or 8 uses from a set.The reliamed does this well.Additionally, the quality seems to be consistently high. The conductive adhesive is thick, and sticks to the pad rather than your skin."
3,"Good adhesive, but not lasting for multiple usage","Good adhesive, but not lasting for multiple usage. They stick on good, not irritating to the skin. However they do not last for many days if the skin is not preped or clean.."
2,Bigfoot crapfest!,"To say this film is poorly acted is an understatement. To say that the sasquatch cgi monsters are terrible is an understatement. Those B-grade 1970's bigfoot films like Creature From Black Lake and the Boggy Creek series are FAR better than this stinker -- a shame in this age of modern technology and film making. The movie's story isn't half-bad, but its execution was a disaster. This one is for bigfoot movie fans ONLY, and then only if you can get it cheap. Dog crap on a stick!"
2,Just starts to hit the surface,"This book has some touching true life stories in it and it does make some good points but it doesn't dive deep enough for me. I wanted to walk away with more ""action items"" that I could incorporate with my husband as he grieves. It was worth my time to read this but I just wanted a bit more instruction."
