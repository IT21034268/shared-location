3,Review for Chain of Fire,"Chain of fire is a book full of courage and bravery. The villagers in a small town (Bophelong) are forced to move away from home to Bop. The people in the village don't like the idea of them moving away from their home to a new place to make a new life. The kids in the village decided to have a peaceful protest, but it did not go as well as they thought it would. Read the book to find out what happens to them.Miel"
4,It's a book like this one that makes me wonder why I haven't read more books by Sherryl Woods.,A Love Beyond Words by Sherryl WoodsSilhouette Special Edition #1382 ~ March 2001Best Selling Authors Collection ~ May 2008It's a book like this one that makes me wonder why I haven't read more books by Sherryl Woods. Allie and Ricky are amazing characters. Allie's quiet strength leaves an impression on Ricky bringing out a protectiveness that surprises him. And it's not just Ricky that Allie impresses it's his entire family. But the risks he takes everyday scare Allie and she's afraid to give her heart. This is a wonderful lovestory. I searched Ms. Woods backlist and was rather disappointed that Ricky's sisters didn't have their own books. I would have loved to read more about the Wilder family.
4,Personal history with an interesting angle,"Assembled from multiple sources and cross-checked against a human tendency to report one's past in a slightly more respectable light than may have been the case at the time . . . an enjoyable book with interesting angles on a great American entrepreneur, Wyatt Earp."
3,"Big Hype, Big Let Down",Big Hype! Big Let DownThis story was good but could have been better if it focused more on the characters and less on the labels they wore. I know the title is Bling and it digs deep into the entertainment business but I felt it was just too much bling for my buck.The characters were easy to love and easy to hate. The story of Mimi overall was good and I was rooting for her. I'm glad things worked out for her and she was able to sing and write her own songs like she wanted to.This look into the entertainment business is a good eye opener for someoneWho is looking to get into it.Reviewed byDAWN
1,BLING IS BOOBOO,"This book sucks! Nothing exciting, nothing interesting, I keep reading thinking since this book has a lot of pages maybe it will get interesting after a while. NOT!! Save your money and if you want to read it check it out at the library or borrow."
2,Bling,"I am astonished that this book was so beautifully publihed, since the substance was so ugly. The premise was great. But the novel was so obviously written by someone not unlike the Imani character. Someone who looked at the recording world, but was not at part of it. Only Ms. Kennedy could not make even one of her characters mean anything. Her fashsion show monologe of designer names, not description became very old very fast and totally demeaned her characters.The character summaries left a very bad taste and did nothing to make me feel anything for anyone's outcome."
3,Not A Bad Read !,"I got a chance to read this after hearing so much about it, and it was not a bad book. It was not the best thing I have read this year but it was good. Lamont, Mimi, Vanessa, Lena & the others are great characters. Some could have been more rounded out and define, but nonetheless it was a good book to pass some time with.It does make you wonder which famous people Miss.Kennedy based some of the characters on.Like I said not the greatest book I picked up this year, but it is a good read."
3,Listen to this one,I listened to this book on cd. It had some interesting characters. There is a lot of characters but when you are listening to them you don't mind so much. This book is funny at times. Basic story though.
3,"Was it the BEST? No, but worth reading","BLING gives you a little insight into the hip hop world. If you are interested in the industry, this is a good book. However, it was a bit long and a lot of characters. Definitely worth reading if you have the time."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"If you're into name-dropping, wearing labels and the mo-money life, this may be a great experience for you. I found that it was extremely long for what you got in the end. This is the second book that was recommended in comparison to ""The Coldest Winter Ever"" and again no match. I realized I was half way through the book and characters were still being developed. Without question it is a quick and easy read despite the number of pages. The ending was rushed and I felt like I had been beat out of time and money. I only finished the book because I had committed to it."
4,Great cover art,"Am I the only one that finds it ironic; the cover art is from ""Forbidden Planet"" but no music from the movie is included on the album/cd? That being said The cd is still pretty good. If your a Sci-Fi collector the album cover art is nice, I still see them in used record bins every now and again."
3,Dudas...,"¿Qué tan cierto es todo esto? quiere decir entonces que es posible predecir ""todo"", incluyendo los futuros grandes premios de la lotería? o justo ese detalle no es posible predecirlo?"
2,Boring and biased,"It is just too difficult to sort out the ideological agenda of the author from the facts. Bernstein utterly fails to understand one of the most interesting people of our time. This book has all the trappings of a serious work but when I read about the Pope I want to know what inspired the man. This tedious chronological and ""investigative"" work fails to provide that and thus we are left with a very boring read."
4,The book you have to read...,"This is currently the best book out there about the International Churches of Christ. It has several sections, including case stories from a number of people who have been involved in the organization, and an explanation of Thought Reform techniques and a comparison to the ICC.Highly recommended."
4,Great Book,I bought this book because I was a bigginger. I bought a couple of other books to help me. I found that this book is the most frequently used book. It is very simple sometimes too basic but has everything I needed to complete my project. I recommend this book to anyone trying to learn Java Scrip
3,"Good, but nothing new here.","This would probably have been a major metal album if we didn't know about Children of Bodom. That's not to say that Timeless Deception isn't a good album, because it is. It is a solid melodic death metal album with black metal influences and tons of keyboards, and overall has a really good sound. The problem is that it's someone else's sound. Children of Bodom did it first, and quite frankly do it better. Skyfire delivers a solid performance here, but since they cling so closely to the trademark CoB sound, comparisons are inevitable. The keyboards aren't as precise as Warman's, the guitar work not as deadly, and the vocals lack the venom and whiplash delivery that Laiho does so well.I hate to trash what is really a decent album, but originality counts for a lot, and it is missing here. I'd recommend Timeless Deception to those who just can't get enough Children of Bodom, and don't mind bands that imitate their sound."
3,A little un-realistic,"I recently bought this book, probably due to my own problem with self mutilation. I have to say that even though I did like this book,the end didn't leave me with any real answers because to me it just didn't seem realistic. Anyone who shares this problem, and who reads this book may realize that you just cant stop cutting as easily as the author made it for Callie. Although, maybe it was just me and I was looking for answers in the wrong book. Anyhow,this was a fairly good book,especially for someone who would like to read about a girl who is also into cutting. I would reccommend this book to my fellow self mutilators, but not if you are looking for answers.Personally,although I identified with Callie in so many ways,I still felt empty at the end."
3,Not Enough Feeling,"This book is a deppressing, but intresting quick read. Cut tells the story of a girl, Callie, who is at a treatment facility Sea Pines (or Sick Minds as the teens call it) because of cutting herself. This book tackles serious, and important issues evident in teens today, but it was a dissapointment. The book did not get into Callie's real feelings, so it came across very superficial. It seemed as though it was being written by parents warning there kids of what could happen to them. I was hoping to gain a deeper understanding from this book, as I know of too many teens who inflict themselves with injury. I would reccomend this book to high school age and up, as it presents serious issues in very graphic ways. This book maneged to keep me wanting more, even though it lacked Callie's deep thoughts. In cocnclusion, this is okay, but not as insigtful as I had hoped."
3,Over Simplified,"I love Young Adult books, but this subject matter is heavier than most and doesn't fully explore the Self-Mutilation issue. Speaking in a first person account, teen Callie is in a mental care facility for treatment for cutting herself. She has stopped talking and refuses to participate with either her counselor or groups. With the threat of being turned out, Callie comes to the realization that to be healed, she must come to terms with her chaotic family life and heal some old wounds."
3,cut,"i cut myself from time to time for punnishment when i did something wrong. once in a long while i would accidently cut a vein or pop a mole instead of stopping the blood i would put in a jar and sell it to the gothic kids at school . yea that was very stupid, but i got real good luck now ,j/k. anyways i only cut myself like 5 times and then i read this book it was alright. but it didnt help at all. fyi- i never really sold my blood or poped veins but i did accedently pop a mole and put the blod in a jar but just for fun"
4,Cut,"The book Cut By Patricia McCormick was a great book. It was about a teenage girl in a hospital for ""cutting"" herself. She doesn't say a word for the first half of the book, but like they said, she can only keep quiet for so long. I thought the theme and the message in the book was intriguing and the rising action made me want to keep reading more and more. I really enjoyed this book because there was barley a resolution; the book just ended suddenly. Once you read it you'll understand. I really recommend this book, for females; I doubt males would want to read stuff like this. The book is interesting, I just couldn't put it down, and I'm sure it will be that way for somebody else."
5,Avid reader,Love this book so much. It has helped when I was younger and is a good read now that I am older
5,Great Read for Our Evergrowing Population of Self-Mutilators,"Although some may not understand Cut, there are many children in our society who do. Self-mutilation seems to be a growing trend among the youth of today. Patricia Mccormick has spent the time researching what lies behind and the path to healing for this trend. Perhaps more importantly, it is a story which shows young adults that this trend is in reality a problem which must be adressed. Although many will attempt to compare Cut to Speak, there is no proper way to compare the two. Self-mutilation is a psychological issue which a person chooses to fall prey to. Speak on the other hand, deals with someone having psychological issues as no fault of their own. While both pretain to the idea of someone finding the courage to seek help, they are sill in more important ways unrelated. Cut is honestly a wonderful read which many adolecents would find a valuable resource."
3,Cut,"I am sixteen years old, and I just finished this book. At first it made me squemish, but after I read it a while i couldn't put it down. This book helped me understand what some people do instead of focusing on their problems. I would recommend this book to anyone."
4,awesome,This book made me think... think alot. (and it made me feel like talking too) It was so... descriptive about everything! I could imagine what was going on right in my mind. It was like watching a movie... no.... it was like i was standing right there with her. Very cool!
2,"Well written, but lacking... something.","This was a good book in the way that it was well written. She writes with ease that makes your eyes fly over the words of the page at a good rate, and it doesn't clutter itself up with pretentious words. I liked the main character Callie, but her reasons for cutting do not seem justified. I also would have liked to see a little bit more information about the other girls in the hospital with her. It seemed like one could go on so many different ways with them. For a first novel, not bad. For me spending my money on it, I'm not impressed."
5,Recommended for teens who cut and their families,"an engrossing, well written book that provides some insight into the mind of self inflicted violence."
1,don't waste your time with this book,"I found the book unrealistic and trite--an almost wannabe Girl, Interrupted that fell short of the realism that Susanna Kaysen was able to portray having actually gone through the experience. Patricia Mccormick's writing style is childish at its best and she lacks a real connection with a fifteen year old (translation: the main character comes off fake and more like a robot than a real fifteen year old girl). This book has single handedly become the suburban mom's guide to her child's issues. Having been a fifteen year old self injurer I was almost offended by the ridiculous portrayal of a painful and shameful issue that I myself had to struggle through. This book may draw attention to something that many people have had to live through but it doesn't do it in a way that's either tasteful or realistic.[...]"
3,It was okay...,I thought this book was just okay. It went into detail about a lot of things that weren't relevant to the story. I think this book would be better for a teenager than an adult. It was only 130 some pages and I read it all in one night. I wish she would have went on with the story and explained what happened to Callie.
5,Great novel!!,"Cut is a powerful book about the self-loathing and confusion that seems to be such a part of adolescence. Callie, the main character, is ""staying"" at Sea Pines, a rehabilitation unit for teenagers. Reluctant to discuss her problems, she finally discusses her habit of cutting herself with her counselor. This painful outlet seems the only way Callie can release any of her inner turmoil. Her relationship with her mother, father, and her sickly younger brother all play a part in her illness. While she decides to work at getting better, it is only when she runs away from the facility that she starts to see the truth of her situation; sometimes other people make mistakes and we pay for them. Highly recommend to anyone who felt out of control as a teenager (most of us at one time or another) or anyone who has a teenager."
2,cut.. not as good as it should be,"I was very disapointed in this book. For a book with such a strong name, it was a big let down. I'm not saying it was a bad book, it kept my attention the whole way through, but I was REALLY disapointed.. I cant really explain it, but dont expect too much from it."
3,Compromises the Issue,"Though the book was okay, it didn't give good vision of the issues the girls at Sea Pines faced, as I had hoped it would. It doesn't depict Callie's dependence on cutting and she was all too eager to stop. There was definitely something missing from the book. And I'm sorry but it is not that easy to escape from a mental hospital."
3,Not as strong as some of his other recordings,"While the Noah routine is wonderful and the ""Nut in Every Car"" is pretty funny (especially the winos talking to each other), most of the rest of this recording is disappointing. The primary reason for my disappointment is that the producer simply spliced together a bunch of ""bits"", complete with applause fades and pauses between cuts. As a result, the recording never gains momentum. Bill is at his best when he's telling stories of his childhood. If that is what you're looking for, buy ""Revenge""...it is a MUCH stronger CD."
2,Promising book that falls flat,"When I saw this book in the store, I thought it looked promising, a nice light read. However, after finishing it ( which I had to force myself to do) I found I cared little about the characters or their situations. Rose seems to draw her characters flat, making what happens to them pitiable, but you find yourself wondering, who cares? Whatever humor was attempted in the book comes off awkwardly, and you wonder why you bought the book in the first place"
4,a fun summer read,"the JAP Chronicles reminded me of Jane Green's novels, or Elinor Lipman's: fun, light reads that are also very well written, so you don't feel guilty for reading ""chick lit"" instead of Tristram Shandy or whatever. Isabel Rose has an acerbic, funny voice, and manages to create seven very different women despite their very similar upbringings and priorities. It's a fun read that stays with you. You will enjoy it!"
4,You don't have to be Jewish to Love this book!,"Fast reading and emotionally charged. Could not put it down. Isabel Rose's first novel is a winner! You may despise some of the characters, but you still want to know what happens to them. It brought both laughter and tears with the ending having a very nice karmic touch."
5,Excellent Rythems...,"This CD is excellent. I just got it the other day, and have been listening to it non-stop. I enjoy music that helps me to be quiet/contemplative, while also something nice to play in the background while doing other work. This CD is perfect for it. It would also be perfect for Yoga, personal chanting, making art with, or a great CD to set the mood with a loved one. I wouldn't recommend this CD if you are serious about Kirtan chanting, as this is more ambient background music, and it doesn't go deeply into mantra-chanting. I honestly wish I had purchased this CD sooner as it makes a great addition to my collection of mantram-type music."
4,"Solid followup to ""Charity of Night""","I've been listening to ""Charity"" quite a bit over the last few months, and wondered if ""Breakfast"" could be as good. It is, though it has a different feel than its predecessor. There are some spoken-word pieces with dream-like lyrics, some upbeat numbers and a couple instrumental tracks. Overall, it's growing on me more and more.On a different note, I've read several customer reviews (here and on other Cockburn discs) that suggest starting with ""Dancing in the Dragon's Jaws"" if you're new to Bruce. I'm not sure I agree. I bought ""Dancing"" a few weeks ago, and it comes off a bit dated, with Bruce's voice sounding young and immature, despite some excellent songwriting. I'd say ""Charity,"" and perhaps even ""Breakfast,"" are fine places to start."
3,Pretty good review but not for real beginner,I was past this learning stage many years ago and bought it just to refresh myself.Dialogs were good but translations were often a little off. Sometimes just wrong. Can not translate waiter to waitress. There is a difference.Accent marks in the Russian dialog were occasionally wrong. This can make a big difference in what is being said.
1,Unfounded claims!,"A person with no scientific or nutritional background, by being a pastor decided to make claims about food and its consequence to the human body....very shallow and broad statements are made, and this books is not really much help to anyone trying to change their lifestyle and be more healthy! It's actually annoying, as it takes so much time slamming all the bad stuff, and some good stuff the author considers bad....instead of talking more about all that we (christians or not) don't do enough of...that's why we get sick....Mr Malkmus...I'm not sure you're an authority in nutrition and health to write this or any book about these topics!"
1,Do not read this book!,"Do not read this book! It has useless and stupid information. The very little important information would be common since to most people who have ever gone to school. I strongly recommend that you don't read this book. I'm a christian and I still do not think it is a good christian book. If you like coffee, cokes, tv, music, etc. then you shouldn't read this book. It will tell you that it is wrong for you do these things. Please do not read this book!!"
5,Brilliant toy,I have lots of lego and I really love the life on mars sets. I got this set for my birthday and I love it. Even my Mum and Dad play with it. I love that you can build lots of different models and can use your imagination. Well done lego keep up the good work.
5,exactly as I expected...thanks!,"Great, speedy delevery & service, the book was exactly as I suspected talking about Amort schedules & what not. Thank you!"
1,Wrong size shipped twice!!!,"I ordered this for my son for Halloween. I ordered a large. When it arrived, it was a medium. I returned the wrong size and requested a replacement of a size large. When I received it the second time, it was a medium again. Apparently, someone cannot read. I was very irritated. Ended up having to run to the local store and buy another costume which was not what he wanted, but did not have time to wait for them to ship me the incorrect size yet again. Absolutely ridiculous!"
5,You can go back again,"What a treat. This album - The Sea - took me back 35 years. The effect was instantaneous. I was 23 again, care-free and in loveMy son came by as I was listening to ""The Sea"" and asked me if I wanted my old Rod McKeun albums back - He said he has 4, In Search of Eros, ...the Warmth, The Earth??, etc., I really can't remember the titles [I thought I had lent them out before my last move 30+ years hence and never got them back.] Aaaparently he went through my records right after we moved in and took possession of my McKuen's. They are being shipped as I write this.The philosophers and scientists are wrong with the right venue you can go back again."
5,romance,"Forget Barry White. This CD is the ultimate seducer, especially if you love the sea and the weather effects. Used to play this on repeat in the sixties and I am delighted to have found it again. This goes beyond 'Easy Listening'. Wonderful"
5,This is in my cart!,"My record is so very old and worn from playing it over and over! This is the first of the 3 I had in vinyl: THE SEA, THE WIND, and THE EARTH. I don't know that I ever appreciated poetry until I listened to Rod with the musical compliment behind! His voice may not be as smooth as some...just touched with a wee bit of gravel but it gives you the feeling of a man who has lived and loved and will again. Besides the beauty of words and music, there are so many lessons one can learn about love. For us, the older listeners, it is great cuddle music where you can hear what's in your lover's heart that he cannot put into words."
3,Roger Ward: Superstar of American Racing's Golden Age,"This book is a good account of the life and times of the subject, but again falls short of the true depth of the man and his profession. Highlites and activities of the profession are not the substance of the time. For the price, I believe the book and its subject matter are lacking in detail!!"
2,not the best~ eniz,"I thought that this book was o.k. for the most part, but I really didn't like some parts at all. What really gave the book a bad effect was what LaVaughn finds out about Jody. I think that kind of ruins the book. I was very sure that she was going to talk to Jody, or something, but after she finds out the true thing behind him, I think it was a total waste of writing. I don't really reccommend this book to anyone, it had a nice writing style, but the actual writing wasn't that great."
5,"Wonderful, wonderful book!","I enjoyed Make Lemonade (the first book) and sought out this one, the second in the trilogy. This one was even better than the first! LaVaughn is fifteen now, and her life is changing as her best friends have discovered religion (Cross Your Legs for Jesus), her mom is dating after ten years of widowhood, and her childhood friend Jody (now gorgeously handsome) has moved back into her building. Her goal to get to college is stronger than ever, but obstacles keep popping up in her life, wearing her down, until she feels like she just can't take anymore. A wonderfully touching book filled with wry humor, Wolff succeeds once again with her poetic style of writing about teenage life. (I just hope the last book in the trilogy doesn't take another 8 years to write.)"
3,Surf pop over rock,"Although there is no denying that Dale virtually pioneered his technically superior surf guitar skills to a historical level, this compilation of early hits unfortunately takes a back seat to infuriated instrumentals in favor of too many vocal-led boppers that have receded in relevance."
2,Good for core concepts,The CCDA flash card book is good and does a decent job of practicing core concepts for the CCDA exam. Do not use this book as your sole source of preparation for the CCDA exam.
4,Best history book ever!!!,"I think this book is the best book ever written about the history of persia and the trojan war. it talks about the gods, goddesses, famous people like Achilles and Hector, all through the eyes of ordinary people. Xanthe, who works healing wounded soldiers, falls in love with this Persian soldier guy Alastor. Xanthe has a very close relationship with her sister Marpessa who never ever speaks, olny to Xanthe, and can see the gods. Aphrodite, bored of war, war, war, decides to make things more interesting for herself, so she gets her little son Eros (Cupid) to shoot at Marpessa AND xanthe, so that they will both fall in love with Alastor. This book is sad, funny, and happy all at the same time. it shows what life was like for people back then, and what happens to Xanthe and Marpessa."
2,"If you will the book,find the cheapest available!!!","Adele,I grant you two sympathy points.Although the book was admittable fairly well-written,it was not enough to reach my expectations.The story was alright in the beginning,with a plot that kept me enthused for a few pages,I felt many sub-plots in the story were unnecessary.By the end of the of the book,the main characters were either dead or alive.Plain and simple.I did not enjoy this book.Well,I had to read this book for school anyways,so I know I wouldn't enjoy it in the first place."
3,It was okay,"I thought it was a good read, but I wouldn't recommend it for its greatness. The concepts presented are noteworthy but the presentation was mediocre."
5,Science Fiction for those with imagination,"One of the all time best SCI-FI books ever.I have read most the reviews here and can only feel sorrow for those who can't imagine the scope of this book. That is their failure, not the books. The amount of information that is thrown at the reader is gigantic and every time I re-read this I get lost in it's universe and the possibilities it allows. This is what I like most about SCI-FI. It has almost no limits to dampen your imagination. Even 20 years after the writing it's still current in a sense that the Zones of Thought are described as dynamic instead of static. This means that there are no fixed rules defining our space time. Here today, gone tomorrow. The flow of information can be just as dynamic."
2,Almost worth the chore of reading it all,"I truly wanted to like this book, and eventually I did, but not very much. Every week I plowed through another several pages--not in anticipation, savoring the temptation of teasing myself with only reading this little bit more, as I did with Winter's Tale or Soldier of the Great War, but because I thought that surely, surely there would come a crescendo, a climax, an emotional involvement, even. Alas, there was not. A grand vision, not realized."
2,Mediocrity in outer space,"I have long been a science fiction fan. Starting with Asimov sic fi has been my passion. I only read sic fi. However, in the case of this book I felt dirty upon finishing. This was not sic fi. This was mediocrity incarnate. Honestly, if alll books were as bad as this one in the other wise noble field of science fiction I would start spending my long lonely nights curling up to a mystery or some such piece of garbage genre"
2,boring,"in responce to another reviewer.. Ilove Gibson and throughly enjoyed Hyperion series and have read the Dune series 3 times.I also like fast paced adventures (C.J. Cherryh) and complex characters. I also liked Ringworld. With that in mind I gave up slogging through Fire Upon the Deep. I struggled to find out what happened in the end and gave up and read the end and that wasn't even very satisfying. Traveling through the slow zone is this book is like. Maybe I just can't handle ""hard sci-fi""."
1,"Firewood, at best","Is this really what the sci-fi world is coming to? On the strength of his Hugo Award and the good reviews this work received on this website, I decided to give Vinge's ""Fire Upon the Deep"" a try. And was bitterly disappointed. Vinge writes like Jeffrey Archer on a bad day and his characters have the psychological depth, and are about as interesting, as Jackie Collins'. This is not Space Opera, it is Space Soap Opera. Seriously, chuck this one in the fire, and order a few of Iain M Banks' early ones, or Dan Simmons' Hyperion/ Endymion, for a display of the beauty, scope and insight that really good Science Fiction can offer."
3,Hard To Read,"This is what happens when a scientist tries to write - ugh! The ideas are indeed nifty, but true writing comes in being able to adequately, and suspensefully, communicate those ideas into something that at least approaches literature. So I will continue to plod through, because of the previous great reviews and the Hugo Award. Hopefully, I will make it - but I have my doubts only after 70 pages."
5,Christmas present,This was a Christmas present for my son in-law and he was truely exicted about receiving the tie. He is a true die-hard Cardinals fan.
4,just what I needed!,"This case made the perfect gift for my brother, a fast-rising star at his new position with a marketing firm. I wanted a smart, functional computer tote to show him my pride for his success-the reaction he displayed confirmed my own! thank you."
1,Unfortunate Experience,"I purchased the Lagon Lmini 350 as a Christmas Gift. It would not download from the first effort. I spent over 4 hours on hold for tec help from the manf. of my computer as the Largon phone continually said that the company was NOT available to help me. I tried to call up their internet site and a message on the screen said that the site was NOT availabe. So, I have a gift that will not work from a company that will not answer my inquiries for help. Beware ! ! ! !"
2,not their best,"I've been a great tmbg fan ever since Flood came out, but this one never really caught on with me. To me there wasnt anything on this album that stood out or was catchy. like the Greatful Dead's career, every song seems to be stuck in a rut.Tmbg still have the potential for another really great album, but this one isnt it."
5,Consider this one!,"I got this for my niece; she's about 2 and a half. She loves it. At this age she mostly loves the sample music button (there's about 8 clips of different styles of music) because she can jump around and dance to them. And of course she likes making the sound effects as well. I got it because I thought she could enjoy it now and grow into it too, and I was right, because she's also starting to like the keyboard. So she's improving her motor skills, learning piano, and entertaining herself. Her parents like it because it makes her happy, they can dance with her - and the volume's adjustable."
5,up and clean,"certainly not ""DOWN AND DIRTY"". highly recommended, very informativeand it makes one appreciative of the earth (dirt)..."
4,dirt,This is a very interesting and informative book on a subject that we all think we know something about. I was amazed at how little I actually knew. The only problem I had with this book was that the print was so small. I don't understand why they chose to use this extremely small font. A little larger would have been much less taxing to the eye. The content rated 5 stars!
5,New respect for the ground I walk on!,"Anyone who might be grappling with their faith and looking for a way to grasp the 'organic' movement should read this book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading DIRT, and am going to get into the whole composting thing!"
2,Great apocalyptic non-fiction!,"What better book to send to your friends or parents back east than a book about California sliding off into the sea?! Keeps them in their place, reinforces their prejudice, and a good yarn too. Never mind that the majority of the world's population lives in earthquake zones like the Ring of Fire and the Big One is overdue in places like Tokyo, Japan, and nobody seems to care--for good reason. Do you really want to live forever in Toledo, Ohio?"
5,Like a long island ice tea...,"Taste kind of like regular iced tea, but hits home a little later....Really I thought kind of ho hum until a couple of hours later."
3,surprising,"This was a wierd movie which unfolded in an interesting manor, highly recommend it despite it's strange format...great psychological twists"
5,Required reading!,"Without the waste of wordiness, yet with terse tenderness, Jerry White charts two journeys in his book: his journey and the Biblical journey with a singular destination; the fullness of the indwelling Holy Spirit. The integrity, the humility, and the humanity with which he writes are disarming. This author, with the accumulating years of reading what others have written, and what God has written in His book, now writes with the wealth of authenticity.For those with a hunger for the Spirit in fullness, and for those who need to learn of such hunger, this book is what the academic world calls, ""required reading"".Thank you, Spirit of God, for blowing fresh wind across the pen of Jerry White."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this product. There was no monitor reading at all until I had worked up a good sweat and then there was a greasy stain left on the shirt I was wearing. Simply putting a drop of water on the monitor before putting it on worked much better for me than using this product. I haven't tried any other similar products, so I have nothing to compare this to; but if, as others say, this is better than the other available products, I guess I will stick with water."
4,RAISED IN A LIONS DEN.,"I noticed many of the people reviewing this album got it mixed up with ""Grateful Dead"", which is a completely different album. ""THE Grateful Dead"" was the Dead's debut and is a damn good offering. Not really as psychedelic as some people describe it. You can be completely sober and enjoy this. Lots of upbeat tunes that are really well written. The sound quality is what you'd expect from a 1967 debut but it adds to the charm in a way. I'm not a deadhead but I really like this album. Try it out."
4,Better than I expected,"Really 3.5 stars...but better than I expected. Still suggest scors of Live releases (starting with Steppin' Out, DP 18 and 31) before this. I was nicely suprised. They have a long way to grow but the ingredients are here for the most part. Still has too much of the surf guitar sound of early 60's CA rock for me...but is moving towards the Rolling Thunder of 1968-9. ""Anthem of the Sun"" captures Rolling Thunder well for studio... Live Dead, DP 4, and Fillmore West (1969) IS Rolling Thunder"
2,none too pleased,"This shoe sure looks good, but the insole is so slick that your foot keeps sliding into the shoe. Plus, for some reason the 'last' does not seem like it was made for a real woman's foot. But I was desperate for a gray shoe. Until a better one comes out, I'll be using this one and complaining that my feet hurt throughout the day."
2,Not as good as their recycled toilet paper,"Marcal makes a great recycled toilet paper. It's all we use. But their paper towels are pretty pitiful. Try to tear one off, and it rips jagged, not on the perforated line. I prefer seventh generation recycled paper towels. Once I get through this case of Marcal, my next will be seventh generation. Mind you, recycled paper towels of any brand aren't as ""nice"" as Bounty, Viva & such. But still, I'd use even these lousy ones over non-recycled any day."
2,"Trite and to put it politely, ""it stunk!""","This book was trite. I bought it with high hopes and it did have some worthwhile pointers, but it seemed to be disorganized and the information wasn't laid out in a way that you could refer to it. I read through the whole thing in a couple of hours and the one pointer that came up about 3 or 4 times was how it was not lady-like to leave sanitary napkins in other people's homes if you are an overnight guest. This struck me as strange not only because it was mentioned at least 4 times, but I cannot imagine ""packing-out"" my trash like this, especially if I were a guest for a number of days. It also mentioned what a lady does when she's had to much to drink, I think that it is not lady-like to have so much to drink that you cannot get home, etc. it probably should mention that over-indulging is not lady-like. I plan to return this book because it lacked a lot and next time I plan to buy Emily Post."
1,Disappointed,"The book is written on a phrase-by-phrase basis about simple, common-sense issues. This would be a good purchase if the reader were much younger, maybe nine years old, but does have a negative, somewhat bitter approach to manners."
4,A little reminder,"This Book is an easy read. Many of the rules are divided up into sections. Going on a Date, throwing a party etc... As with anything some of it is common courtesy. Touch up on how to become a lady and Enjoy"
5,An essential buy for all trueSpace4 users!,"Inside trueSpace4 maintains the superb quality of the Inside series. Frank Rivera and his co-authors have managed to pack this volume with a lot that is useful and interesting, to both new users and trueSpace veterens.One minor suggestion would have been to duplicate the screenshots used in the book, on the CD as a couple don't make their intended point clearly in when shown in black and white."
1,Not Good Quality,"The 1500 mAh Lithium-Ion battery would not hold a charge nearly as long as the 900 mAh nickel hydride battery that came with my Nokia 5185i phone. It is the only vibrating battery I've tried, but if this is what they're all like, the feature is of no use to me, since the vibration is not significant enough for me to notice it when the phone is in my pocket. The display on my phone malfunctioned twice, requiring replacement of my phone, during the two weeks I used this product. I cannot say that this battery was to blame, but I certainly suspect it."
4,Good Value,Got this and the other Gall Force items to complete my collection of them. If you like older animes this fits the bill.
3,Good but left me thinking it was lacking.,"As always with the Signal series it is of a high standard. The photo's are excellent, the drawings interesting and the colour centerfold showing the different camo's are brilliant as always. But after reading the book, it felt to me that there needed to be more information. What is there is good and concise. But it just didn't seem to cover anything in detail. I would have liked to see a more in deapth mission discription for the plane. What they do and why for one. But overall this isn't a bad enterance into the F-14 and worth the money."
4,Definitely a page turner...,"I have always been one that was intrigued by Lisa Marie Presley. Probably because the media spotlight has always been on her and her story has always been so mysterious. The only thing that anyone new about her was what the media has said, and some parts of the book address that. The book takes it's information through interviews and other books (about the Presley's). The only thing that would be better is if LMP would write an autobiography, but maybe a few more scandals and mishaps later, she might. But it is definitely an entertaining read, showing a side of Lisa Marie that isn't seen that often. Definitely a page-turner."
3,!!! FRICTION... !!!,"""Friction"" is a book about some teens, a teacher, sexual harassment, and lies... this painstakingly authentic book shows how people other than the direct victim can get hurt. This book thrives with all of the confusion and immaturity of the characters, which made the book worthwhile to read. Let's face it: a book about a teenager getting harassed and acting weird is hardly going to fill up enough pages to make a book. So Frank seems to have been forced to add the character 'Simon', and the story take place from another girl's perspective. Mediocre book overall, but Frank has, in my opinion, wrote other books that are more up to the current standards in literature."
2,Seriously deficient,"This printer is not merely user-indifferent; it is user-hostile. The black-and-white print quality is very good, but it eats its own weight in expensive consumables several times a year. The icons on the LED panel are largely incomprehensible. The paper tray is a flimsy piece of crap, with utterly illegible black-on-black lettering that gives no indication of manner of use. If it runs out of paper you have to reboot it to get it going again. Worst of all, there is no user manual. The Reference Guide is only a few pages long and contains no details. All other questions are referred to an alleged 'On-Screen Users' Guide' which in fact does not exist for this model. After many hours of experimentation I still have not succeeded in printing a photo, because nothing tells you how to do so."
4,WORKS WELL NO COMPLAINTS,We have owned this printer for about 2 years now and it has held up very well. We have never had any problems with it We use it primarily for black and white printing and sometimes color. We have never used it to print photos so I can not say how well it would work. The printer is very well made and the stainless steel gives it a nice look.
3,HELP,"When this copier is working, everything is o.k., in fact excellent, but when lights start flashing apparently that's secret. I have read everything that came with the copier but nothing I have found tells me what the lights mean. I tried phoning, but as usual these days I was answered by a fellow from some strange country who wouldn't answer a simple question about lights, but was happy to send me new cartridges. Even that transaction was very nearly impossible given the language difficulties. Oddly, he wanted to charge me huge for three-day express delivery, but I declined , and the cartridges arrived the very next day for free delivery! Incidentally, where can I find information about the flashing lights?"
1,can't recommend this printer,"I haven't written many bad reviews on amazon because I usually research products well and rarely have problems with what I buy. This printer was, sadly, my first and last HP product. I bought it just about three years ago online and am now about to put it up on craigslist for free. In short, the light for the black ink cartridge started blinking and when I went to replace it I noticed that a small plastic tab for the spring which aligns the cartridge was broken. Without this plastic piece - the spring can not hold the cartridge in the correct position and the printer won't work. I live in New York City and can not find someone who can replace the housing the cartridges sit in. HP tech support was little help and so, after less than 20 printing jobs (I rarely use a printer at home) I'll have to get rid of what appears to be a perfectly good machine. Hence, I can not recommend this product."
1,"Amateurish writing, detestable theology","This is a particularly gruesome example of all the bad art that gets published by virtue of being Christian -- and I use the word ""virtue"" loosely here. The writing is laughably amateurish and the theology is detestable. The author, who apparently is ""the handsome Jack Collins"" himself, seems less concerned about making a a case for Christianity than for his own particular brand of it -- and, in the meantime, making everybody else wrong, wrong, wrong. This is narcissism justified by a rather twisted interpretation of the Christian faith. Think the worst of Ayn Rand, in a Christian package. This book made me wonder why there's so much lame stuff out there under the Christian label -- mediocre music, kitschy art, and, incredibly bad fiction, like The Summons."
5,Never been released dvds??,"What are the episodes that this set have that was not revealed in the previous dvd collection?? I can bet that 1996,1998 Yankees plus Yankee Stadium episode will be there."
1,BORRRING!,"This story was really borrring. It was all I could do to read it. I skimmed over a LOT of it, just waiting for SOMETHING. I've read a few of Jackson's other books and they weren't too bad. This one just had sooo much nothing in it. Even the BIG SECRET can be figured out in the beginning. I just hate to start a book and not finish it > that's the only reason I read to the very end."
2,"Kept me reading, then made me mad.","This is the kind of book that goes in the garbage after the first reading. I LOVE this author, but this book was awful. The back of the book was misleading. It makes you think Maggie might become Marquise to find out what happened, but she just interviews people.Not much suspense in this novel. When I got to the end, there was no ""OH WOW that is so neat!"" Instead you could hear me saying ""WHAT THE *&^$#% THAT SUCKED!"""
3,Nostalgia Isn't What It Used To Be But It's Not Bad,"I hadn't listened to this album (vinyl) in over 20 years until this morning. Funny, the songs that were knockouts 40 years ago are now a little silly (Windy), trite (Cherish) and even pretentious (Requiem For The Masses). Somehow, Everything That Touches You and The Time It Is Today have evolved into my favorite cuts on this album (now converted to CD, thanks to Sony). It was fun to hear all the cuts again and I would pick this as one of the best non-Beatles albums of the 1960s."
3,Up and Down,"I spent High School listening to this band. What amazes me is they could record Never my Love, then jump to songs that make no sense. This is a terrific collection of about 7 songs. Beyond that is a mixture of a band trying to find their sound in the 60s."
2,Sometimes Not the Real Thing,"I bought this vinyl version several years ago and it was mixed well. I bought a version of this cd a couple of years ago and the mix was not the same and the music itself just sounded not like the original. Since then I've down loaded the songs I like and got lucky. Sound quality was excellent and was exactly like I remembered it. I have read about these early rushed to cd's from the analog version and questionable original masters. One execellent example is the awfull and embarassing cd version of several of the Jefferson Airplanes first records. This seems to have been the case in what you may or might no get when getting this cd version. As always, let the buyer beware. Good luck."
3,Needs remastering,"My title says it all. This is why I don't have pre-Revolver Beatles on CD. The accompanying vocals on the Association CD often sound louder than the leads coming from another place in the speaker. I assume this CD was originally mixed to preserve the 3-track sound world of the 50s and 60s. A sound world which, I believe, sounds lousy in digital media.Recently, I had the pleasure of listening to the (radically) remastered Yes recordings from WEA. IMHO, they sound great with the vocals in the center, the bass guitar reduced in presence and the cymbals sharpened and brought up in the mastering. The same label's ELP recordings were similarly reworked. WEA should put this (the Association's greatest hits record, and any subsequent Association recording) on the list of future remastering projects.So, unless you have mono-compatible equipment, this CD can be maddening with the lead vocals jutting back and forth from speaker to speaker."
3,The Dandelion Caper,"The Dandelion CaperKathy Entsminger and Calvin Wille Ford are two kids who have saved many aliens or ""suits."" These ""suits"" are alien people from outer space who came to earth just to look around, but don't think all aliens are good ones because they run into some pretty mean ones at the old Diefenbacher Place. The aliens at the Diefenbacher Place are invisible green lizards. Kathy and Calvin found their cat, Dandelion at Diefenbacher Place. Dandelion turns out to be an alien leader whose collar is her space ship. Dandelion seems to know Calvin's Uncle Harold very well. The lizard aliens capture dandelion and Calvin's mom. Uncle Harold drives over to Calvin's house to pick him up and he also goes to get Kathy. You'll have to read the book to see what else happens. I didn't really like the book that much, but if I had been younger I would have loved it! If you like sci-fi you'll probably like this book. It did keep my interest however. I give it a 3 star rating!"
2,Watch out for the connector style of this cable,"I bought this to connect an iMac to a G4 Mac. I now know that this cable is restricted to pc computers and does not fit Mac 400. Also, the packaging is so difficult to open that I had to cut the plastic. Therefore, I have a cable that is of no use to me which I cannot return. This information should have been included in the description."
5,Boulevard Nights,Love the movie! The theme reflects life as some young latinos have experienced. Takes an insight into the lives of two brothers and the love and bond that drives them to their destiny.
1,Really Bad Bootleg Copy,"I ordered this movie and it was a horrible bootleg copy. I can believe that amazon allows this to happen. I should have known better because this movie has never been produced in dvd its only been in vhs and whoever owns this movie is making copies from a vhs to dvd and it looks dark and grainy. You can hardly see the faces its terrible. So be careful if you are trying to order this movie and if you do, get ready to watch a really bad bootleg copy."
4,More than I expected,"I'm somewhat of a paper engineer myself so it didn't bother me that there were no instructions. It's easy enough to figure out by the actual pop ups and the geometric ratios provided. There were some elements I have never seen before and a lot that I had seen before. It was nice that there is a lift up flap in the back where you can observe the inner workings and easily take it apart if needed.It's a nice reference book for all kinds of folds and pop ups plus some fun motion type cards that don't actually pop up but move. If you are already comfortable with making action cards or pop ups, you will enjoy this book. If you are a newbie to this kind of card, you may be frustrated by the lack of measurements and instructions to make each element. Don't buy the book if you need someone to dictate exactly how to make the element."
5,A great book for students.,"I have been teaching pop-up book design in my college 3-D Design class for about 6 years. My students have created many wonderful and beautiful projects. They not only create the mechanisms, but also fine artwork to match them. One of the most time-consuming aspects of the project is learning the specifics of mechanical design, This book illustrates in three dimensions the underlying concepts. It is very easy for a novice to gain an understanding of simple mechanics, proportions, and gluing methods.Elements of Pop-Up is a simple book. It alone is not enough to teach high quality design. Well-done artful books are a must. There are many excellent examples such as A POP-UP BOOK of PHOBIAS, FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT IN POP-UP, A VICTORIAN FARMHOUSE, THE 12 DAYS of CHRISTMAS: A POP-UP CELEBRATION (by Robert Sabuda), any of the National Geographic pop-up book collection, and those by Chuck Murphy."
4,"Raw, gritty, powerful jamming","For Deadheads looking for the sound they loved in the 1980s and 1990s, this will be a bit of a surprise. Because the sound of the band then, and especially Jerry's playing, was completely different. Jerry's guitar playing, before an accident that caused him to have to completely re-learn how to play, was totally different in this phase of his career.This set of live material shows the band at the peak of its early 1970s form. The first time I heard it I didn't like it much. The second time I started liking some of the tunes. After 10 or 15 listenings I learned to love almost the whole thing.Belongs in the collection of any deadhead, and may make a good introduction to this phase of the band's career for anyone just starting to investigate the Dead."
4,Good...,"This is a good book, that has a lot to do with growing up. It's very well written and pretty interesting. This is clearly a classic growing up story. Though a bit slow, this is defendly a story that I recomend."
4,The Sequel to a Really Cool Book,"In the Princess Diaries 2, Mia is still the insecure teen that she was in the first book. She is a princess dealiing with the shock of it all, saying dumb answers to questions on a national TV show, her mother and her Algebra teacher (the subject which she is flunking) having a baby and getting married, a huge crush on her best friend's brother, and a secret admirer who won't reveal himself. As the book unwinds, Meg Cabot makes it seem like Mia's secret admirer is Lilly's brother, Michael. But the real admirer is repeatedly mentioned in the homework section. When Mia finds out who it is, she agrees to go on a date with him, but is never going to give up hope on Michael Moscovitz."
5,A great book,"If you liked the first princess diaries book, you will sure get a kick out of this one!Fifteen year old Mia Thermopolis is struggling to be a normal teenager. Boys, homework, boys again. But on the other hand she is the Princess of a small country named Genovia. Things are getting hectic in her life, Mia's mom is dating her algebra teacher, (by the way what is her worst subject!) everyday after school, Mia still has princess lessons taught by her grandmother Grandmere. Mia has a secret admirer who keeps on sending her letters, but won't tell her who it is. She also has a crush on her bestfriends brother who by the way only thinks of Mia as her sisters bestfriend. Even though Mia is the princess of a small country, you have to look on the other hand. She is also just a normal teenage girl trying to live a teenage life! If you want to read a GREAT book, pick this one up, and you will never be able to put it down."
4,Mia is back again.,"How much worse could Mia's life get? She can answer that quite simply for you, much worse. Mia Thermopolis could easily give you many reason why things can and will get worse.After finding out she was a Princess and having to endure Princess lessons with her Grandmere Mia is still taking Princess lessons and still hating them just as much as she did when she started. And her Grandmere is still just as mean and weird as she always has been.From find out from her mom some very shocking news, to having to go to an interview with a big time newsreporter, to having a secret admirer. Mia doesn't think things can much worse for her.Mia grows up in this book and I loved how they showed her life and how she has to go thru it with all the bumps in it.I can't wait to read more about Mia's life and how she struggles with being Princess Amelia and how she struggles being Mia freshman at Albert Einstein High School."
1,Very disappointed!,"I purchased this product as an alternative to building my own. I own several Larin products and am very pleased with them. However, i was very disappointed with this dolly set. The metal is rather flimsy and bends rather easy when the weight of the ATV is on them. The weakest part i would say is the casters that the company has chosen to use. I had two casters fall apart before i even got a chance to use them, all of the ball bearings came out and had to replace the units myself. My first attempt to use them resulted in one of the casters snapping in half and shooting bearing all over the garage floor. That was the last straw that i was going to take and i sent them back. Save your money and build your own. These would be fine to use IF the company would have used heavier duty casters."
1,Awful,"I thought this book was awful. I struggled to get through it, but wasdetermined to finish it after paying for it. I read a lot of romancenovels, but this one was pretty cheesy. It wasn't exactly what I expected either, the back cover of the book says that the hero, Gavan, appeares in the heroine's, Priscilla, millinery shop to purchase fripperies, and that isn't at all how they even met. This book is very disappointing. END"
4,Instant Classic,"I never write reviews for anything, but I think this one deserves it. I am a fan of every French Kicks cd, but I honestly think this one is quite possibly their best effort yet. Each track is so original, and they have only gotten better since their last cd. I don't think there are any songs that should be skipped; this is really a great cd - if you like their other albums buy this for sure!"
5,WENDY.CHYNNA.CARNIE,"Well this ladies had it goin on again, although many people has stated that they don't understand this version of GO YOUR OWN WAY, I could, This clever ladies, said!, well if were gonna make a acover of Fleetwood Mac, well, to not disrespect the original, let's do a completely different version, and they did, a version were the tracks are slow and with a lot of harmony. For me they have in their hands a really deep version not in a point of comparison with the original, but this is so delightful to hear....it's really heartbreakin', Carnie, Chynna and Wendy are heading to a great album, but with the slow infution RADIO has given to this track, let's hope SONY don't give up on this project and promote a second single cos there's a lot of material in CALIFORNIA, this track it's superb!"
2,"It's their second album, not their first","The first album, ""Child Is Father To the Man"", is far better. The group was founded by ex-Blues Project member Al Kooper. The band subsequently kicked him out and came out with this album which lacks the imagination and drive of the first. Plus, Al Kooper is a much more interesting singer than David Clayton Thomas."
5,It Never Gets Old,I've been listening to this music since it came out as an LP. It's a great collection of songs four or five of which are among my all time favorites. It Never gets old.
1,Let's be honest here...,"OK. Just because people have the ability to play intruments does NOT mean they are talented musicians. BS&T create songs that make you want to crack your skull open and scoop out your own brain, just to escape the stupid melodies, rhythms and lyrics. ""Spinning Wheel"" is nothing short of ridiculous. Everything else is nauseating. I'm not trying to be negative or anything. These guys quite obviously have the ability to play their respective instruments. They just fail miserably at making good music from that ability."
1,What a let down,"I finally got my switcher, reset my tv and cable box and the thing would not work with my TV. It sent it into haywire mode. I have a 2006 model 55 inch Grand Wega which is a pretty popular TV. You would think that Belkin would realize this but apparently not. What a waste."
3,Beware: No cable included,"The switch itself is great. Clear signal, remote control-able, and no problems so far. I have to give only three stars, though, because Amazon's product description is incorrect. No cable is included with this switch. Based on the description, I ordered only one extra cable, instead of the two I needed. They offered a refund if I sent the unit back, but it was far easier to forget it and just go buy an extra cable, all of which delayed my setup. A minor annoyance, but an annoyance nonetheless."
1,Poorly written,"An interesting story. Cook makes many valid points about our overvalued markets (and did it in 1999). But this book is so poorly written that I found it hard to make it all the way to the end. As this novel aptly attests, smart financial people don't necessarily make good writers."
2,"plot is OK, writing is bad","The plot was plausible, but characters are shallow and not developed well enough to be interesting. Token inclusion of sexual innuendos and scenes were trite, distracting, and unnecessary. A far better depicture of a collapse is ""Patriots: Surviving the Coming Collapse"" by Rawles. I would [buy] this book in paperback and throw it away, feeling fine. After spending [the money I did], I feel cheated. If [one is] going to charge as much as a proficient writer, [one] should write as well."
1,Scotland Does Dallas,DON'T ORDER THIS MOVIE!!! It comes from Scotland and is not compatible with American DVD players. Once you open the package and find this out they will not accept it back for a refund. I'm out 30 bucks. Never again.
4,Love it!,"I love Merrill Markoe and her zany relatable characters! I recommend reading ""Walking in Circles Before Lying Down"" before reading this book. It's shorter and will give you a good taste of what to expect with her characters in other books. This one is a really good comedic view. I love it!"
3,Good Utility Knife,"I recommend the AR 3.00 with a 4-inch blade. Better steel, better knife. Besides, the Paraframe knife probably has only a 3-inch blade, I can't recall. No one is willing to include specs anymore. And what is 400-type steel? That doesn't tell us a thing about what it's made from. Is it a 440 grade? I'd rather have the SKW002 Maxam. (Maxam is a low-grade importer of Chinese knives that does carry a few very impressive models, despite their low prices. The SKW002 is one of them. Heavy 3.75-inch blade that will never wear out. You can get them for about $5-$6 in bulk and I'd take one of them for two of this particular Gerber.)Maybe if they published the specs, I might change my mind. But this looking at a picture and ordering, knowing little else, is for the birds."
1,This book is bad and wrong,"This book is bad and wrong. Full of misinformation and shaky characters. First it is hard to understand why the uptight nervouse freak of the mom and the free-spirited daughter would ever like each other even in the slightest. No child would come back home with a mom that crazy. And any nervous freak of a mother would commit such a child to an insane asylum just to keep her hold on her. And any child with a brain would blow off such an insane character of a mother. Second the colors of Wesleyan University are red and black not blue and yellow. Third, there are no valid and honest relationships in the whole book. The characters just use each other for their own hidden agendas which they are not even ever brave enough to voice but just silently torture and starve any humanity out of the other characters to death with. The writing absolutely stinks and there is no purpose to the book at all."
4,Good cooking book,"I bought this book for a friend that loves Peruvian food. I'm Peruvian. This book has a variety of dishes and it explains the recipes very well. I really like it and I like the fact that it has everything explain in detail. The book would be much better if it contained some color pictures, but other than that, it's a good choice."
5,The Best,"This is the best cookbook on Peruvian recipes on Amazon so far. I have other cookbooks on Peruvian cuisine but, none of them match the content of this one. All the recipes in this cookbook are authentic or classic Peruvian recipes. If you've been to Peru and wished you knew how they made some of their dished, well this book will get you there. We're not taking anything from this earth so eat well!"
2,Glyph Glitch,"Glyph was a disappointing book. For one thing, it was not as represented. The ""satirical"" premise, narration by an infant prodigy, might have been sustainable in a short story, but extended to book length, it grew tiresome. It became an excuse for an ostentatious display of erudition. We former schild prodigies found it a sort of intellectual slur."
3,Clinical viganettes of Pediatrics,"This book gives you 56 major clinical cases of Pediatrics. It presents cases beginning from its history, physical, images and ""associated diseases"". The big features of this series are that the cases are presented within 1-3 pages, with the diagnosis at the end of the page. So you can test yourself by hiding the last row. Also the important keywords that are included in the cases are highlighted, so if any of them are not familiar to you, you can check it out. Almost all the cases selected are very important, and it is highly possible that you see them on your exam. But if you have no trouble getting a clinical picture of each diseases (e.g. IMG already practicing pediatrics), this book may be unnecessary."
1,Another backlash book,"A far ""Crueler Tyranny"" is the victimization of a child by a trusted adult (priest, rabbi, teacher, coach, scout leader), and the subsequent revictimization by a society that abhors child abuse in the abstract, but tolerates it in reality.This is just another backlash book from an author who never met an accused child molester who she thinks wasn't railroaded into jail. While the jury and the prosecutors found the evidence compelling enough to convict, Rabinowitz states that one of the reasons she believes in ""Tooky's"" innocence is that his fellow inmates think he's innocent - that they really know who's guilty and who isn't. Someone needs to rebut this book, and challenge her in open debate, because of the harm that this backlash is doing, especially to discourage victims from coming forward."
1,Questionable Research,Read the Wenatchee portion of her book and realized she did not ask any hard questions of the people she feels were wronged.Actual statements of some of the accused as reported in the newspapers and in court of appeals records raises questions about Ms Rabinowitz's conclusions.
3,I nearly stoped.,"I prefer AIRMAN and Artemis Fowl, just not my type of book. :/ I would still recommend to some people."
5,Plays on picky players,"This is the _only_ CD-R that will play in my '02 Jeep Wrangler's stock CD player. Even the newest DataLifePlus CD-R's have a different dye from these, and they won't play reliably (takes a long time to seek; can't FF;...;etc).But anything recorded on this one plays just like a prerecorded CD.It has to have the dark blue dye to work in a Jeep."
4,I like my mouse,"Im currently using this mouse as a media center. So I cant comment to the gentleman's battery problems as I always put mine back on the cradle, because its like a wireless device with a battery that drains.The mouse itself functions well. It takes getting used to because you DONT have to point at the screen. All the movements are relative to the mouse, not the receiver. I like the button setup, they are easy to get to and it doesnt seem to jitter as much as the wiiMote. All in all, im happy I bought this mouse, I may even try it out on some games.Some of the con include getting used to it :) Also, the laser mouse in the base of it can sometimes throw off the movement. For the most part its a non issue.BTW, im using this with Kubuntu and it was plug and play. haven't tried it on my windows system yet."
5,"Useful, interesting information in a well-organized format","This book is hard to put down! Easy to read and full of great information that we all can use in our everyday lives. I really enjoyed the section about how to build a ""safe room"". Buy this book now!!"
3,Not a Fleetwood Mac gem,"Penguin is a mediocore album. Why? Look no further than the acquisitions of Dave Walker and Bob Weston. Walker proved absolutely useless, and Bob Weston is not Danny Kirwan. The album seemed satisfactory until listening to their contributions. Where did they come to firing Kirwan. The unit lived together in the Lindsay/Stevie, and Danny and Lindsay are two classic guitar players, and with Stevie and Christine he would've added some punch to an overrated album in Rumours. Don't buy Penguin if you haven't listened to Mac before. Only true Mac lovers can appreciate this album."
4,I laughed hard,I thought this was extremely funny and really good medicine. It reminds me of Al Franken's humor.
5,"Calm, yet cheery, scent of essential oil with the best price I found online","I actually bought this for trainings I do for early childhood educators and childcare providers on being green, but I use it in our cleaning supplies, too. It's a wonderful, light scent that perks me up every time I use it. 2 Drops go a LONG way in a cleaning spray bottle, something you wouldn't expect unless you're used to essential oils. I'm sure it would be great for massage and aromatherapy, too."
3,Not as good as most Now products or other orange oils I've used.,"I've used other orange oils before and this is very delicate, very faint. I wanted to use it as a fragrance in water that sits on my wood stove. I had another orange oil that was food quality and it worked great.This hardly has any fragrance at all, and I won't buy this again.Normally I like Now products, but this one isn't what I expected."
3,Smells Like ORANGE PEEL NOT SWEET ORANGE!!!!! LITTLE SCENT,I purchased this wanting a sweet strong orange scent. However IT SMELLS LIKE ORANGE PEEL when the item says sweet orange on amazon. The worst part is that it REQUIRES A LOT TO GET THE SCENT SOMEWHAT NOTICEABLE where as the peppermint and cedarwood oil I have (both NOW products) Only need a slight drop and have a strong scent! Not too happy but not too disappointed still smells good just not as good as I expected
2,This product was almost 2 weeks late and I have (and used) Prime.,"This product did not come with a dropper, so I had to search for one of my kids old medicine syringes just to get any out without spilling it all over the place. Also, unlike most other essential oils I have gotten from Now, the sweet orange needs a LOT of the oil to get any kind of scent."
3,See R/C Cyborg Shark - Blue for reviews,"There are customer reviews for the blue version, see that product description for some comments.R/C Cyborg Shark - Blue by Swimways"
2,I was really ...,"The novel is very boring. Except one part, where the protagonist tries to commit suicide. It has also a different structure, so it is difficult to understand. The difficulty is caused by permanent jumping between the times. Another negative Point is that the protagonist's favourite thing in the world is POETRY."
3,Spend a little more for something better,"This vacuum is not very powerful. I have to go over and over every mess, changing the angle of the vacuum repeatedly, to pick up everything. Also, the vacuum is more trouble to open than it should be. The filter should click onto the vacuum rather than into the collection bucket so that you can pop off the bucket and empty it without setting down the vacuum. As it is, you have to take off the bucket, set down the vacuum, take the filter out of the bucket and then vigorously shake both the filter and the bucket. Overall, the vacuum takes as long to use as my full-size vacuum. Finally, the plastic seems cheap and fits together poorly, especially where the bucket attaches to the vacuum. I wouldn't be surprised if it cracks or breaks before long."
3,"product is ok,the company?????",when we sent in the registration it was returned with NO KNOWN ADDRESS.This does not make the company look too good!!
1,disapointed,"worked great the first time used, went to use it next day and where the charger plugs into the vacuum broke off and no suction. Very disappointed"
1,A wordy and confusing book that needs to be condensed.,"This book takes overexplaining to new limits. For software such as dos, a reader needs instruction to be clear and concise. The content of this book was not clear nor concise. Rather it was obvious that the author was trying to squeez out as many pages as possible to fetch a better price. Furhtermore it was evident that the editor did not take much time on this one due to may mistakes resident in this text. I can't blame that person, in the ocean of needless words its hard to understand what she is trying to say, let alone figure out if she is right or wrong."
3,One way to keep in touch,"Magazine an be entertaining but contains the usual ""society"" pictures. Lots of useless lists of Drs, Dentists, Lawyers, etc. For me, strongest feature is the food and restaurant articles as well as a useful list of restaurants by cuisine. I like to read it in conjunction with the more interesting and irreverent weekly Observer."
4,Stormy Stilley reviews Kissing Tennessee,"I read this book and thought it was great. I thought it was neat how the reader can picture most of the scenes. I liked the way Kathi Appelt put the stories together to where they have surprising endings. My favorite story was ""Rachel's Sister"" because I too have a younger sister. We would never let each other get hurt."
3,It was a great book about a dream come true.,I thought this was a great book on girl who grew up singing in a church quior then deciding that would be her career. Even though her mother did not aprove of this she still followed her dream. I thought this was great book and had as good lesson. This is a great book to help kids follow their dreams.
5,Flamed Harley Barbie,This is for my own collection. I do not sell them. The clothes that are on these Barbies are really cute. Mine is NEVER is out of the box.... Have Fun Collecting them!
5,Excellent,"The Second Season of the Closer is just as outstanding, and might even surpass its first season in drama, originality and humor. Ms. Sedgwick and the sopporting caste have out done themselves. Bravo! This is a must have for any crime solving junky."
3,The order was incomplete,"I ordered the second season of ""The Closer"". However, only one disc was from the second season. The other was from the third season. Since I also ordered the third season, I now own two copies of the first disc from the third season. I understand these things happen. However, it was disappointing."
5,Making TV fun to watch again,"""The Closer"" is the smartest, most fun show to grace the small screen in years. Sharp writing, excellent casting (guests as well as the regulars), interesting plots, and a generous dose of humor make this my only ""must-see TV."" Unlike many police dramas, ""The Closer"" is character-driven, with good plots, not the other way around. You get to know Deputy Chief Johnson and her squad - who are almost more like a family than office colleagues - and you look forward to seeing what develops for them next.Season 2 is consistently good, but there are a few highlights. ""To Protect and Serve"" is absolutely priceless - a hilarious premise, expertly played throughout by Kyra Sedgwick, G.W. Bailey and Tony Denison. The last three episodes (""Overkill"" and ""Serving the King,"" Parts 1 and 2) are more serious, and really demonstrate how the squad takes care of each other.I can't wait until Season 3 - another stellar season - comes out on DVD!"
1,Larin Floor Jack,Complete chinese junk. Stopped working after a few months of use. I'm not even going to bother to try and rebuild it. Going to scrap.
3,Alternates between stellar and sleepy,"The Faces were a good example of great potential not totally realized in the studio. None of their four albums, not even the great OOH LA LA, were as good as seeing them live was. LONG PLAYER certainly has it's moments, but, tellingly, what're best on here are the two tracks from a gig in New York in late 1970. The band's version of Paul McCartney's ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" is terrific---they take a nice but slight song and really power the sucker up. ""Feel So Good,"" the other live track, isn't as rousing, but it has a great call-and-response moment between Rod Stewart and the audience. The rest of the album is okay, with ""Richmond,"" written and sung by bassist Ronnie Lane, and ""Sweet Lady Mary,"" featuring one of Stewart's prettiest vocals, as the best studio tracks. But when a band of (at that time) self-professed rockers only truly rocks out with abandon on ONE track, that's very disappointing."
5,A Must Read,"Wow. I attended an Ignatian school in grade school and again for University, but it wasn't until I read this book that my love for Saint Ignatius came to an informed reverence for the gift that God has given him to be able to prepare and form a movement of missionaries who faced the most adverse of conditions against physical, emotional and spiritual attacks. For a person who is seriously seeking God, the rules of discernment in this book are very helpful if not essential in making decisions that will bring him/her farther along in the journey.Now if only this humble critic can only get these rules from his mind to his heart, then practice it with love, then he'll be set."
4,Ignatian Rules to Discerning Spirits,"I found this book to be very insightful and helpful. Timothy Gallagher tends to be repitious when trying to make his point. However, he realy helped me to understand the movements of the heart. I recommend this book to any Christian who is truly seeking guidance from the Ignatian rules. It is important to note that this is NOT a formula for spiritual living. This book should be used to help Christians understand the spiritual desolation and consolation they are experiencing on their spiritual journey and how to discern the good and bad spirits. The book is also great when it comes to advising Christians on how to handle the various movements of their heart."
1,60s Music Video Album DVD,"What a waste of money and time (to watch it)! With all the wonderful music of the sixties out there, there is so much more that could have been done with this video. The music is limited, the visuals boring. My copy went from the mail, to the dvd player, to the trash!"
5,book review,This was the only McNalley book I hadn't read. I was luckey to find a used copy on Amazon. Thanks!
1,Disappointing,"Although it provides much information, the book manages to avoid insight, both into Benjamin's remarkable writing and into his difficult relationships, both human and cultural. It is hard to follow any thread through these pages. Its place is on the shelf, as a reference work for biographies we are still expecting."
1,This held her attention span for all of 10 minutes,"After 20 minutes of struggling with the wings and unknotting the strings, we finally got this baby set up. When it was my daughter's turn to wind it up herself, there went the wings again! Not to mention that a complete winding lasts all of about 10 seconds. Great concept, beautiful packaging, but extremely poor research. Matell should have actually let real children play with these before releasing them into the market. I spent more time figitting and winding than she did playing with it!"
3,Twisted,"You can always depend on Ms. Morrison for unusual twists and turns. This novel was interesting, moreso for its poetic style than for the plot. You almost dreaded to know what would happen next. The ending was abrupt so say the least. I felt that there could have been much more to the story. Sula with a child maybe? Something. All in all still a decent book."
3,Sula,"Toni Morrison, one of America's greatest writers some say, has a very subtle way of pulling you in and keeping your interest. This book is about two young women and the hardships they share and face as they grow into women. They each chose a different path into adulthood, but are binded by thier small town as well as thier friendship. The climax results in a choice they have to make, that will ultimately mend, or end thier friendship. This novel is generally an 'easier' reader compared with some of Morrison's other ""deep"" stuff."
4,a very good novel that doesn't live up to all expectations,"My biggest mistake in reading this book was doing so directly after i had read the incredible 'beloved'; 'sula' was written much earlier, while morrison's style was evidently still developing. nonetheless, it is an excellent book--well defined characters, endlessly intriguing themes, and written in a fascinating style. often it seemed that morrison should have made this book much longer- she seemed to draw many implausible connections that could have been connected with more explination. for example, she constantly talks about what wonderful friends the two women were, rather than show why they were so close. but don't be put off by my rambling. read it."
5,A true experience.,"This book is one of my favorites, and I can't even begin to determine why. Toni Morrison's style is superb, embracing the reader like the arms of a lover. She manages to bring out the profundity of everyday life that most of us are blind to in all our rush and cynicism. Embrace this book as it embraces you; don't just brush over it because your lit professor told you to do so. Be free within its world."
1,Open One's Mind?,"Such prose is not southern gothic - it's simply nonsense. Do not mention Faulkner in relation to this author - that is insulting a literary treasure. In fact, novels of this mediocrity should never be discussed as literature at all."
4,Excellent book about British fighters history,"The Putnam is an excellent series of aviation books. Every books in this series provides detail information of aircrafts,systems, development, performance and history. This book covers the history of British fighters from 1912 to now, almost every fights you can find in other books. Although there are books for individual Britich aircraft company in this series, this is the book to give comprehensive coverage of all British fighters since World War One to current fron line fighters."
2,decent but unimpressed.,"the leg on one of the chairs came bent, when assembled it is very obvious. the tops of the tables were placed unevenly and the circular top hangs over one side further than the other. they are extremely light weight and could be easily knocked over, but are somewhat attractive when covered up with items on the top. probably would not purchase again but not a bad deal for the price."
3,not what it appears,"The picture and product details make this seem like somewhat of a special cable, that is, a male centronics to female centronics cable. It is not. Or at least that is not what was shipped to me. What was shipped to me was a plain old parallel printer cable: male centronic to male DB-25."
3,Good reminder,The message I took from this was to organize competitive advantage and specific markets. Is everyone in the work group really clear about what competitive advantage we are working to maximize? There are also warnings about local optimization and trying to be all things to all people. Not earth shattering. But still relevant.
3,Addressses,I have not put all my addresses in as yet so I can't really give you a good response. Is there a way I can put the addresses into my computer and then transfer them to my Address Book. What type of USP would this take (if possible). Loret
2,Dissapointed with the product!,I had a similar product with Sharp which had more features. Royal does not give me the option of changing the capital letters to lowercase letters. Entering special symbols and turning off the noise feature. I'll just give this one away since it does not have all the features I'm looking for so far.
1,Comment,"I am not quite sure how the number lock would only be on for one stroke when you are typing, so that does not make sense."
1,Poor sources,"This book only provided unfounded allegations and does a complete disservice to it's readers.It's a great read if you're in the mood for fiction, since the sources are virtually unverifiable."
3,Classic,"This is a reprint of the second edition of Mason's classic work that was published in 1971.There was no mention of this in the Amazon description.I am pleased to have the book, but it is not a source for up-to-date information on cloud physics."
1,What's with the price?,How come the price of the 2-season set is more than if you buy season 1 and season 2 seperately?
5,The Book of Mitzvot translated into English,In the thirteenth century an anonymous Spanish scholar arranged the Mitzvot parsha by parsha. He wrote a small commentary on each Mitzvah. According to the story the author did this to provide something interesting for his young son and his friends. But what has resulted is a classic of Torah Literature which gives insight into each and every Mitzvah. The author gives a reason for each Mitzvah. In this excellent translation Charles Wengrov provides an English version of the Hinnuch which is printed alongside the Hebrew. The result is a wonderful book for study and learning the Mitzvot and their meaning.
5,Great information!,This book gives a lot of information that is easy to read and understand. I would definately recommend buying it!
5,Great book!!,"This is truly the only way to live. Dr. Schwarzbein's plan helps cut cravings and addictions in addition to helping you lose weight. I plan to stay on this program for the rest of my life, and I have to laugh when I hear mainstream advice about lowering weight and cholesterol with a low-fat, high- carb regimen. When will they learn?"
4,The Zone without the hype:),A clear explanation of why low fat makes you fat. It IS the trend right now--but this author seemed to be one of the ones with the science to start the trend.I have adhered to these principles before the book just explained why i feel better at 40 than i did at 20. And my kids don't have the sugar cravings of their friends!
5,Schwarzbein Principal,"I've been doing the 'healing diet' for about 2 months now and I have to say I feel so much better. My doctor recommended the book to bring down my cholesterol, high insulin level and high CRP level. I haven't had a repeat of the lipids yet, but based on the way I feel, I'm certain the numbers will be lower. I also purchased the cookbook but haven't used any of those recipes yet as I'm still on the healing diet. There are recipes for the healing diet in the Principle book. I use those and they are great. Buy the book. You will be surprised."
2,This one's for completists only,"Contrary to some other opinions, the Who is so not at their best here. They sound incredibly ordinary, and it's easy to see why they'd want to close up shop after this one if it's the best they could do. Their best live record, of course, is Live at Leeds, and I'd recommend finding an original release without the bonus material. The extra tracks are often extraordinary, but the original is a perfect disc. The Isle of Wight live disc was recorded just months later, and has a stronger set list but inferior sound. The best live disc without Moon is Live at the Royal Albert Hall. Some of it tops Leeds. Completists and Entwistle fetishists will enjoy Toronto for the Ox songs, Sister Disco, Drowned (full band version, Pete singing) and Eminence Front. REO Speedwagon fans will enjoy all the rest."
4,Long Overdue DVD Bonus,"This is taken from the same concert in 1982 that long ago was called ""Who Rocks America"" and was dubbed their ""Farewell"" Tour. I used to own the VHS of this and really enjoyed it. I love this concert. The band is energetic and still sounds good. If you get the 2 CD set w/ Bonus DVD the DVD has the 22 track concert in Digital Dolby 2.0/5.1 . It is not widescreen but 4:3 Fullscreen. It also appears that the source tape was not in the best condition but that could just be the old tube cameras that were used. Well worth your money."
3,"Performance good, but sound quality lacking","I remember seeing The Who in St. Louis during this tour and they were great. The performance on this CD is still good, but this really does sound like a bootleg. If you're expecting ""Live at Leeds"" quality in the recording, you'll be disappointed."
5,A HAND FULL OF STARS,"This lady deserves more stars than anyone I can think of. She could do it all. What a talent she was. There is no other voice as caressing and loving as that of Doris Day. I have the Bear collection of everything she ever laid on vinyl. BUT I had to purchase this album for the additional songs taken from her TV Special. What a treat. Wonderful sound.To experience a truly wonderful talent with one, it not the best voice ever on records, spend the 15 or so bucks for this cd and see what all of us Doris Day lovers have known for a long time.Who can sing like this today. The art is lost."
5,Doris Day's Last Album of Songs Is A MUST HAVE,"Doris Day recorded this beautiful collection of songs in 1967 and it was not released until the 1990s (thank goodness they released it). It's a MUST HAVE for fans of Doris Day. I have played this CD at least a dozen times in the last month and I'm always finding something new and special in it each time I play it, the way Doris phrases a line, the sophisticated musical arrangements, etc."
5,ROBERT SMITH'S BOOK IS AN AMAZING BOOK!!!,"This book is so incredible I can't wait to finish it so I can read it again. I was going to wait until I finished it to write my review, but within reading the first chapter I knew it was a book I could read again and again. I've never been able to get so involved in a book like this. Robert Smith is amazing and this book proves that! There is so much I could say about the book and how great it is, but I think people should read it themselves and find out how wonderful it is! It's so interesting seeing the professionals point of view. Robert Smith ~ Thank you for sharing your thoughts with the world! Your mind amazes me and I hope you write another book in the years to come!"
4,Saarinen is one of the most commonly-overlooked modernist masters,"Eero Saarinen has created some of America's most iconic architectural symbols. Yet, few everyday people know his names. Everyone instantly recognizes his most famous structures. This book brings you up to speed in a hurry. Fast, easy, interesting book about the man and his buildings."
3,Larry Kane revealed . . .,"This book offers nothing new, and a number of glaring errors (stating that John was 15 years old at the July 6, 1957 Woolton Fete where he met Paul, for example). Larry Kane glorifies his minor role in the Beatles' history--how he saved the day when underage fans visited them, how he made helpful suggestions that he would have you believe changed their careers. Further, it is overly worshipful and fawning--students of John know how he felt about that. Read Cynthia's book instead."
1,Disappointing--avoid,"This book tries to be fair and balanced, but it misses the mark. It's an obvious attempt by the author curry favor with Yoko Ono. Ono, ""a respected artist""? In what universe? Ultimately, this book serves as another attempt to protect the myth of ""The Ballad of John and Yoko."""
5,Great Read on Lennon,"This is not a definitive biography on John Lennon, but it is a sensitive and enlightening one! I enjoyed it thoroughly and would recommend it to any John Lennon/Beatles' fan! Many interviews with various people including Yoko Ono reveal much about the man, Lennon..."
4,An evolutionary invitation to find your Christed self within,The Divine Plan of humankind's evolution requires that we look within and balance our inner and outer lives. Well done.
1,Boring!,"This has to be one of the most boring books I have had. I wish I didn't buy it. I luckily had a great professor who taught well and was descriptive and a huge SW advocate. So, I wasted my money. But, if you don't know what kind of prof or it's required for class, be prepared to be bored out of your mind. I really hope your prof is good!"
1,Atrocious,Really really really bad. I think this might have set my personal record for how fast I turn off a movie and watch something else.
2,repetitive,"This dvd is sporadically funny, but many of the same obvious jokes get repeated over and over (something the compilers realized and mention in the cheezy rap song extra). The most interesting feature is the hidden O.J. documentary, and I'm not even a football fan."
4,it work good,this product is as good as any out there.for the price you can always get an up grade for this.i like this one
3,Needs to be more realistic according to the time it is set i,"I sounded like it was set maybe a hundred years ago... not in the '80s. You may argue that I'm just am ignorant of the fact that Vietnam is still 'backwards', but as a person who has lived in South East Asia all my life, I'm in a position to say that people in Vietnam are desperate, but not in such way, especially not teenagers like Loi. There was too much adventure for Loi, which made the story unbelievable. Other than that its a book that will keep you busy when you're absolutley bored."
2,Useless for the Aerostar,"This manual does not include information for the A4LD transmission used in the 86-87 Aerostar, which is odd to me because the book was published in 1996. With all the Aerostars on the road and given the fact that they are notorious for having tranny problems, one would think that Haynes would have included a section on it in the repair manual, but not so. :("
5,"Ford Automatic Transmission Overhaull Manual: Models Covered: C3, C4, C5, C6 and AOD Rear Wheel Drive Transmissions, ATX (Hayne","I have had a really good look through this manual and it seems to be exactly what I need to overhaul my geargox. I am actually not ready to do so yet, but will keep you posted about my progress once this I commence the overhaul. I am impressed with the very clear pictures and the lengthy explanations on how to do everything. So here's hoping that all goes well at this end!!! Cheers"
3,Not as good as I expected,"After having studied fractals in school and reading numerous books on chaos and fractals on my own, I figured that Mandelbrot's book would be the pinnacle, surpassing everybody else's interpretations and getting the information ""straight from the horse's mouth"". I was wrong. Mandelbrot, while he may be a brilliant mathematician, has not quite mastered the English language. The topics that he speaks of in this book are basic, not exactly what you would expect from the leader in his field. He doesn't even go into real specifics, or not the specifics that I wanted to see going into this book. In fact, I didn't even bother finishing it. There was nothing new, no powerful insights that other books may have missed. Mandelbrot, it seems is much better at mathematics then at writing. My suggestion is to buy a different book on the subject."
3,Dis-engaging,"The book was very eloquently written and had some very good observations and interpretations. I only wish I cared more about the characters who seemed to be more a collection of ""attitudes"" rather than real people. After the first couple of chapters it seemed to be a kind of point scoring excercise (""Well I never considered that!"" style)which didn't add to any narrative flow. I finished it, I must admit that the ending was a surprise, because I wanted to know what happened and not because I especially enjoyed reading the book ."
3,not my type of theory book,"I bought it a while ago, and read half way through and gave up. I don't like much of the way it teaches harmony, which is more suited for improvisation or jazz musician taste while I was into classical music theory. It's not my type of book, and I certainly would look for something different or more formal type of book next time I search for a theory book."
4,Charming erotic fantasy with a real Celtic feel.,"The Magic Cup is wonderful. It is a romantic story with a plot that hinges on a prophecy much as does the movie Willow. The girl is adorable, the guy is great and both are believable characters. It is somewhat reminiscent of Morgan Llewellyn in its strong ties to historical events and the author's obvious familiarity with all the specifically Irish elements of myth. Lovers of her books and also of Diana L. Paxson are likely to treasure this hard-to-find book."
4,The Magic Cup,I very much enjoyed this early book by Andrew M. Greeley. I'm a big fan of his and look constantly for books by him that I don't already have.
5,Fantastisk!!!,"This is a cool cd, rare and good!! A lot of great horn blowers here!! Among them, Arturo Sandoval.... GREAT!!!!!!"
4,Rail Memories,"Like the sound of a distant train whistle late at night, the selections in Michael Gee's Anthology of Steam Railroad Poetry will stir memories in anyone with even the remotest connection to the romance the glory years of railroading. Engineers, firemen, brakemen, stationmasters, townspeople and cowboys all come alive one more time in the verses written by the people who originally fell under the spell of the ""engines that truly alive seemed to be."""
5,A Wonderful Coin Purse,"I love this little coin purse. It is of the highest quality leather and very well-made. I like how easily it fits into the back pocket of my jeans. The only issue, for me, is that it doesn't handle bills very well. But it will fit one or two folded; it's just clunky."
1,NO MORE ROWENTA IRONS!!!,"I received a Rowenta Steam Iron Generator DG 980 back in 2005. It worked well for roughly two years then it stopped working. I replaced that one with a new one, same model and again, after a few years it stopped producing steam. Now my second Rowenta Steam Iron Generator DG 980 is resting in peace in a dumpster!!!I also own another smaller Rowenta iron and after using this one for a few years the steam button broke all of a sudden. You can still use it but it's not easy to iron now because as soon as you take your finger off the button it comes off. What a hassle!Lately I've been busy researching the web for a new steam iron and I'm looking for a totally different brand (perhaps Delonghi, they offer a 3 year warranty while Rowenta products are warrantied for just 1 year from the date of purchase). I've learned my lesson well- NO MORE ROWENTA IRONS! THEY DO NOT LAST. What a waste of money."
5,Excellent !,"I bought this item a few months ago and so far it has performed flawlessly. The steam output is incredible. It has cut my ironing time in half. It irons beautifully, my shirts look as if I had used starch. Worth every penny."
3,LET THE SUN BURST THROUGHT THE FOG!,"I think this line from Barstool Blues sums up the whole feeling there is about Zuma, after Tonight`s the night one of the darkest and introspective works from Neil, in Zuma he finally lets the light in, and as shown in the front picture takes off again towards a new life.... A record to listen to when you wake up in the morning, neil has described this once ...The guitar playin on Danger Bird is outstanding as the beautiful Cortz the killer is ....two unmissable chapters.."
1,This and trash is the same!!,"Here is a book which gives Fidel and his followers carte blanc in all the typical rhetoric that he has been so succesful in mystifying for the last 40 yrs, and half of Latin America and the American Left have fallen for. Now there is Cuba, resisting "" against all odds"" vs Darth US and its EEEEvil Empire. In reality is more like the poor Cubans, against the Emperor in Havana, with its Stalinist repressive regime, which has given them, ""free"" education and health care in return for ""exchanging"" their soul, their food, their underwear, and submitting them to slave labor so that HE can remain in power. All this happens because the EVIL United States???? Have some common sense, please!!!"
4,"Get Drunk, Kick Somebody's ...","This movie has great action and it's very funny. It's less boring than the first one, however the reason I only gave it four stars is that the beginning was a bit boring. There is a very cool, very drunken fight scene at the end! Also Jackie Chan's messed up family contributes to the humor. Martial Arts fanatics should definitely see this movie!"
2,U.S release doesn't compare to the original,"The U.S release is a far cry from the original,and more of an insult than anything else.I can tell everyone though,for a fact that the original theatrical release (spoken in original Mardrin&Cantonese&subtitled in English) is the S&^%!?*^!.It's not only entertaining and hilarious,the fight scenes are absoloutely INCREDIBLE.So,if you get the opportunity,buy the VHS tape.I did about 6 years ago,and although it's not dvd quality,it's still a fantastic film.I suggest checking out EBAY for it on DVD,you may be surprised and find the original out there?This is a MUST HAVE film for any Jackie Chan/Martial arts fan.It's a perfect blend of action and comedy.I suggest staying away from the editied/dubed U.S release,it's been butchered...find the original,it will be worth every penny even if it costs a bit more."
5,Simply Fantastic,"This is a great movie for the Jackie Chan fan who loves action. In my opinion, this is Jackie Chan's best movie, because it has some of the best stunts and fight scenes ever preformed in one of his movies. So if your looking for a good Chan mmovie and your on Amazon.com, take a look at The Legend of Drunken Master. You won't be dissapointed."
5,Best Final Fight Scene.......EVER MADE!!!!!,"The dubbing is awful. The transfer is amateur. However, the fight scenes are incredible. The final bad guy displays some of the best kicking ability you ever see on film. Being a Tae Kwon Do competitor, my jaw was on the floor when i saw what this guy could do. If you are at all interested in the finer martial arts, BUY THIS MOVIE."
3,Great movie except for the LANGUAGE CHOICES,"Great DVD, very clear, wide-screen, good movie. But why did they have to ruin it by dubbing it into English? American viewers need to realize that dubbing a foreign movie into English NEVER makes it better. Keep the original language track!"
4,Jaw-Dropping Isn't the Word!,"I am an avid fan of Jackie Chan's movies, and this is one of my favorites so far- up there with Supercop, Operation Condor, and The Protector (if you can find it).While the translation and voice-overs may have been lame, I often expect that from foreign films. And while the original score may be missing, and the plot and humor may be corny... you get all the action you could ask for! And that, my friends, is what a Jackie Chan movie is all about.In fact, I am not even going to tell you what the story is about- Just trust me when I say the fight scenes are well worth the price of admission. The man is insane.-Also includes an interesting interview."
2,wow. how original.,"so this is probably some of the least original music i have ever heard. the main vocalist sounds like a constipated baby, and every song consists of drop D breakdowns, a plethora of sour notes, and typical repetitive pinch harmony based guitar riffs...the only reason im giving this a 2 is because their are some plentiful keyboard segments (the guys good at piano) and he has a relatively nice voice."
3,Print quality horrible.,"The content is a bit difficult for the average reader, but I am grateful for it nonetheless. However, I have never seen such poor quality in any other Kindle product. Had I known the quality to be so poor, I would not have purchased this for my Kindle. Surely it was never edited for words are broken apart. It is hard to read. I hope a revision is in the making."
2,"Decent set of tools, cheap case","I wanted a set of tools for easy access and quick fixes to keep handy on our boat. The set contains a good selection for common needs. I was looking for a set in a well laid out case to keep track of tools. Unfortunately, the case is flimsy and not likely to last long. Tools don't stay in place when the case is opened. Guess you get what you pay for - and it was not expensive - also the kind of risk on viewing on-line and not seeing the product in person."
4,Looks cool but smaller than expected.,"As advertised, but I expected a larger lava lamp. The description states 11.5 inches. I thought that was for just the glass part. I bought two lava lamps for my son at Wal Mart last week and they are bigger and were $14.00."
3,lava lamp,"Was very adorable for my nephew. Does get overheated though, can not leave plugged in for a long time."
3,Seemed cool at first,"This seemed like a cool product when it first arrived. Then the ""lava"" scattered it is just looked yucky. Now it is mostly a pile of ooze at the bottom and doesn't really give the lava lamp effect."
3,lacks pronunciation guide,"I found this book helpful, it is more than comprehensive in terms of its scope and the categories make it easy to navigate. My big problem with this compilation is that there is no pronunciation given in the definitions, so there is no way to know how each English word is to be pronounced. This is so important because English pronunciation is very irregular. I had some of my ESL students just throw this book out because they couldn't make anything of it."
1,Irritating show.,I did not like this show at all. Most of the characters are very annoying. Bad acting and lame stories. Could barely watch I got so irritated.
5,Awesome show,"Super funny show. Full of great on-liners. In my opinion one of the best shows on television and now, DVD."
5,Awesome Book great for praying scripture and spiritual warfare,"If you want ideas and directions to pray for your teen or really anyone on your prayer list this is a great book. My girlfriend bought it and after I looked through it I couldn't wait to get it. If you by it and use it you will see break through. Scriptures are listed to backup the prayers, this would enable you to do more study on your own and maybe even write your own prayers."
1,Casio WVA430DA Review,This is a feature full product and looks very nice but due to few design flaws I was very disappointed with it and will be returning my watch that I bought on 12/03/05 from amazon.com. It is advertised as having a metal case but parts of the case are made of plastic. Especially the part where band attaches to the case is made of very fragile looking piece of rubberized plastic. Also the band is not flexible near the case but instead extend as a fixed part of the case approximately half an inch away from the case. Therefore for a person with a small wrist like me it does not fit well.
1,Very Big Disappointment,"This product seemed like it was going to be an excellent tool. I have three computers that I use set up on my desk and have a keyboard and mouse set up on all three.First major downfall was the crappy software that came with this device. It lags and glitches something terrible.Second major downfall was the crappy buttons that are supposed to let you chose the computer your connected to. Mine never worked at all, everything just blinked stupidly.Overall this product was a HUGE disappointment. Save the money and use a program like Input Director or Synergy."
3,Belkin F1U400 USB Peripheral switch,Allows me to connect 2 computers to several devices.However is not compatible with the MAC computer. Have to disconnect the PC from the switch for the MAC tous the printer and ZIP drive.
3,It works,"It is rated okay because I would have like to have a longer length of pull cord, although it has worked for over a year now."
4,overwhelming,Saw this film for the first time last night and was overwhelmed by the stories told within. This is a new and different perspective of the awful time in our history of World War II and Hitler's rampage to rid the world of jews. The stories of these saved children was well told and brought tears to my eyes. I myself immigrated as a 2 year old with my parents from Holland in 1940 just before the Nazi onslaught so this movie was particularily poignant for me.
3,Good skating-terrible tape editing,"I bought this tape after reading a review of it,and was very disappointed. ... the performances are great, but there are too many interviews, too little complete performances, too much repetition of clips, and the tape editing is awful. The biggest problem, however, is with the music which sounds like it was recorded inside a tin can"
4,Kodak Scanner,"Product is great, seller is great, shipped within few days, all in all, I am satified. Tx"
5,This is a great show !,This is a great show !Agarn and The Sarge are the best duo there aver was....The whole F Troop is wonderful....
4,TV SERIES,Remember this show as a kid. It will not only bring great memories but also something to watch again and again!
5,Best furniture coaster available.,This is the best product available to protect hardwood and laminate floors and keep furniture in one place. The ability to retain them to furniture legs with screws keeps them from falling off or getting left behind when rearranging furniture.
5,Excellent moisturizer,"I have used Fresh Lips for years and have had excellent results. I use it as an overnight moisturizer. It makes my lips soft and even. It prepares my lips for the next day's products, providing a smooth surface.It is a moisturizer, not a plumper. Any plumping action will be a natural by-product of the sloughing process, but it is not marketed as a true lip plumper. If you are looking for a plumper, I recommend Lip Fusion XL.At $15 per tube, I think it is incredibly economical compared to its peer market."
1,Never received product,"Company charged my credit card over a month ago, never received product or an response to my message regarding shipment whereabouts..."
1,Save your money!,"Unless Reprise has finally gotten around to remastering this,and I don't think they have yet, buy the individual albums, unless you are a Neil Young junkie and will buy anything he releases."
2,Died after 5months,"This adapter/extension cord worked for five months. It did not hold a charge more than about 15 minutes the entire time. Therefore, I always had to keep the computer plugged ito the outlet. The other day, it died out of the blue. First I thought the power in my house went off. I checked the outlet. It was fine. I plugged the computer into another outlet. It worked for a minutes (green light on), then stopped. I felt the adapter and it was burning hot. My computer is 7 years old (Powerbook G4) and otherwise in good shape. Too bad Apple has stopped selling the real deal adapters. I have to spring for another 3rd party now - and I don't expect it to last too long."
5,Pictobulb?,"It said that it came with the bandana and I got it, but it also said that it came with the picto-bulb can someone please explain?"
1,THE SPACE IS IN THE HEAD OF THE WRITERS,"Oooh....IN THE DEAD OF SPACE is a scifi bomb paired with a madman killer, all in the confines of the Tesla space station. We even get George Chuvalo, the former heavyweight boxer, in the role of a cigarette chomping Russian terrorist leader. (For all of three minutes). We even get B movie hunk Michael Pare playing the villain and acting like he's lost his mind. I think Pare the actor has to have even considered participating in this massive clunker.The special effects look like they were created on a child's computer by a child; the script is incoherent and dull; all of the acting is bad; the sound editing is atrocious; people's lips move and they're not in sync with the dialogue, and the addition of the African American celebrity whatever adds nothing to the already horrendous plot.A real stinkeroo..don't waste your valuable time like I did."
3,Not postcards...but greeting cards!,"Don't let the reviews fool you.... I figured I was getting a paperback book with tear-out postcards in it...hence, the lower price. Instead, it's a box of the same images on greeting cards. They're nice if greeting cards are what you want...but if you want postcards skip the Yellow Art Box! (Edit: I notice this review has also been posted to the Blue Art Box product. But I did not order that and therefore cannot review it. These comments are for the the Yellow Art Box only.)"
4,super tension!,"NOTHING TO DECLARE is like reading a Robert Louis Stevenson in your grandfather's library, as sun sets through the windows on a quiet evening. The tension & escapes are palpable, the excitement of the travel & the fine autos satisfying, & pure curiosity kept me riveted.An international American smuggler, a world-class Polish forger, a vengeful British embassy clerk, a French police detective on the eve of retirement, an Irishman of many masks, an ancient Scottish ship & a massive artillery gun are stirred & shaken in this tale of childhood enemies, gambling & betrayal, love & greed, murder & fear."
3,"Maclopedia- Dated, But Still Good","This book is definately an excellent idea. It was written well and packed with tons of information, but unfortunately, it hasn't been updated for three years. If there were a 1999 Edition, I might have given it a Five Star rating. While the book is still good and entertaining to read, many people might be upset with the old information. Bottom Line, update it for God's Sake!"
5,Eye Opener,What an eye opener this book is. It is a perfect illustration of how eating good healthy nutritious food chance literally change our lives. I highly recommend this book.
3,"""Best of"" set is hampered by excess.","This set draws from Malo's four Warner Brothers albums released during the early 70's. Unfortunately it is weighed down by excess. Several of the songs are presented in edited form rather than the much better original album versions. A few of the songs on here could also have been dropped to make room for the full-length versions of the more better songs. Of course ""Suavecito,"" the band's biggest hit, is included on here - twice; in both the full-length and single versions. Those who are new to the Malo sound would probably check this one out to get a pretty good summary of the band's WB albums, but there's really not much that's new for fans who already have those albums. Average."
5,last album with Bob Welch,This is a must have album for people that are only familiar with Fleetwood Mac featuring Lindsey and Stevie. Bob Welch moved the band into rock territory and away from strictly blues. Great singer and guitarist! Christine fans have to hear this album! Prove Your Love and Bad Loser are 2 of her best songs. This album should have sold millions but came out at the height of Glam Rock. So it was virtually ignored. Buy this and Mystery to Me and find out how they eventually sold millions of albums. It started way before 1975!
5,Metal Walker Rules,"It is like pokemon, but better, siunce some kids find pokemon little-kiddish, with this being sa little more mature. Plus, robots are very cool, and that makes this game a wonderful product."
4,"Metal Walker - Like cockfighting, only better!","Fans of robot action crazyness rejoice! Metal Walker is like watching a bunch of toddlers share a small play-pen! Buy it if you like straightforward RPGs, and enjoy spectacles of cartoon robot violence!"
3,Great book until the ending punks out,"This is a wonderfully crafted book. I was enjoying it thoroughly, and near the end it was all starting to come together, building what looked to be an intriguing and exciting climax -- then, the ending just fizzled out, leaving me greatly disappointed. I had been all ready to rave about it, but then the ending soured me on it."
1,pretentious tripe,"One of the biggest disappointments of my literary life so far. purple prose mars an already convoluted story (if i may use that word lightly) and frequently cliched, lifeless characters. Helprin should be ashamed of appropriating the title of Shakespeare's lovely tragicomedy.Useless as reading material, I would nonetheless recommend the the hardcover version as a good booster seat for small children at the dinner table."
1,Gimmicky. Elitist. Insubstantial.,"Why do people love this book? It reads like a J. Peterman catalog: one big long commercial for racing over the snow in a sleigh, having a slate swimming pool in your house, and eating oysters. This is great art? Please. And I am someone who loves New York, the city and upstate.I picked this book up on my boss's recommendation and hated it right away, but I'm unable to put a book down once I've read more than a couple of pages. So I slogged through the next few hundred pages, hating every one. Lucky for me I'm a fast reader. Still, I want a refund on those weeks of my life."
4,Winter's Tale.,"I was pleased with the copy of Winter's Tale and the price was good. I had to change to mylar, but that was ok. I will order again from this vendor."
3,Evokes NY and raises important themes...and yet...,"I loved _Memoir from Antproof Case_ so I picked up _Winter's Tale_. I enjoyed the first 80% immensely, and loved the evocative mystery of the Cloud Wall, of Peter Lake's wonderment at the city, and the representative wealth of the Penns. But as the millennium drew nearer, the endless, mechanical activities of Virginia, of Hardesty and even Peter began to weary me. By book's end, I was thinking ""Yeah, yeah, justice, God, love...whatever!""However...the prose is excellent, the interpretation of what NY secretly represents, and the themes of the book all merit strong consideration. If you read a LOT, read this book. But don't make it the one novel you select to read this year. (It did make me pick up _Gotham_ and _The Power Broker_ as my next couple of reads!)"
1,"I realize I am out of step here, but . . .","I simply did not enjoy this book. I found it too disjointed in plot and character development to hold my interest and make me read on. I literally forced myself to finish because other readers whose opinion I respect think so highly of this book. What I thought was intended to be funny was not funny to me and I simply wasn't overcome by the plot, the themes, the atmosphere, the language (except for limited and brief excerpts) or the characters. I do intend to read Soldier of the Great War which I am told may appeal more to my tastes. I could not decide as I was reading whether I was holding a fantasy, a historical novel or some other genre. As I was reading, I was asking myself why I should care about finishing this book (and I hardly ever fail to read a book to the end.)"
2,playing with fire,"I was really looking forward to this book, especially given the hype etc. Unfortunately it didn't live up to expectations. The first 20 pages, great, witty etc, then down hill from there. It really draaaagged on and on, not finishing as well as it started. Don't think I'll be reading another one of hers!"
2,Scratching the surface,"I was extremely excited to purchase this book but fairly dissappointed in the results. True, most of this information is already online. There are some good things: ready reference for those who don't have fast internet access or who prefer paper to monitor. It also gives some additional insight into the skills and what they do. Another plus is that it doesn't give too much information away -- it doesn't spoil the stuff that should be found out about during game play. I guess what I was looking for was a more comprehensive decsription of game play and rules -- things like ""Does two items of 'Half Freeze' duration equal full imunity to freeze? Or does one simply cancel out the other?"" -- that type of thing."
3,Good but needs improvement,"Well, let's start off by saying, it's a heck of a game. BUT the book needs a little bit of work on the actual walk-thru of each quest. For example, instead of giving you detailed info on each quest, they tell you, go to the X area and get Y. they dont tell you HOW to get to X area, and exactly where y might be. Understandbly, it's hard to write a manual for a game that never has the same map twice. :) Also, they could have told you you'd lose the AWESOME KHALIM's FLAIL when you destroy the compelling orb.. Grr otherwise, its very detailed as far as weapons, and I especially like the gems area. I am playing the paladin, so I didnt read much on skills, but it looks like the book has a good skill section. All in all, I'd get the book, why not?"
2,Honest Advice,"The book is in short, incomplete. I was very pleased with the extensive section on the skill trees for each of the five classes. This is the most important aspect of the game, and an appropriate amount of the book was dedicated to it, unfortunately all other areas of the game are described in an abridged fashion. The quest descriptions were complete in the sense that all prudent information was given, but strategy was for the most part ignored. The lists of Unique items is difficult to read and lacks complete information about each item. I firmly believe that all people will notice the sizable amount of information lacking in the book and will op for the internet as their base of information regarding Diablo II."
5,This Guide is an essential!,"I would recomend that you get this guide, it has listings of armor, weapons, skills, magic, and many others. If your a newbie or a pro this stratigie guide is for you. It has stratigies for desinging your skill tree, and it gives pictures and deatailed decription of what monsters attacks, weaknesses, and health. It also sheds some light on the NPC's backgrounds. For any true DIABLO 2 Player this is for you!"
2,Worst Strategy guide ever purchased,"This is the worst strategy guide I ever bought: Why?1. No strategy. Is this spell better than that?? This book will give you no such info.2. 40% of the book is pictures and tables.3. Quest info is pretty limited.4. Read it in 30 minutes (due to lack of content)The reason I buy strategy guides is to help me understand the logic of the game and help me through some rough spots. This book did not help. I found much better info on the web.By comparision the Diablo I strategy guide was much better, provided more strategy and it helped me defeat the Butcher. This is the first time I write an online review for a book. And I would not do so if the book was not so lame"
2,Lackluster at best,"The Diablo II guide adequately covers all aspects of the game, if a list of how to complete the quests, and what the skills do is what you call adequate. The main problem with this book is that it is not a ""strategy"" guide, since there is virtually no strategy in it at all. No help is given in the sense of tips for how to create a good character - no information at all on how to best allocate experience and skill points. The multiplayer strategies are about five pages of stuff I already knew. The guide gives you a basic overview of the game, but the original Diablo strategy guide is far superior.Blizzard should have written the guide themselves, or got a better publisher like Sybex, who always do good guides, to do it. The worst part is that in the introduction, Mr. Farkas readily atmits that he only ever got to play the game during his two visits to Blizzard North. How can you write a strategy guide if you've hardly even played the game?"
2,A dissapoinment.,"I was greatly disappointed by this book. The layout is very good, but most of the character and quest info can be found in the game manual as well. I had hoped for more information in subjects like Cube recipes. The item charts, including unique items lists and set items attributes are useful, especially if you don't have Internet access. If you do, pass on. The bestiary is interesting, but in my opinion it could include the number of experience points each monster gives you. Overall, I think it was fun to read, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,Why?,"Ok, if you really want to find hellp on something like thisjust look to the net. The only nice things are the comparison tablesand those weren't that great except for the fact that they are in a book and not on the net."
5,Intelligent Writing Makes for a Great Introduction to Yoga,"""How to Know God"" was my first look into the world of mysticism and yoga. I would have never dreamed how it would change my life.""Most books on religion have been a turn-off. I'm not into ""being saved"" and other emotion-filled events that won't happen to me.If religion can't be sensible and rational, I'm not interested.If that's how you feel, this may be the book for you. Highly recomended."
3,Maisy Gets Ready for Bed,"If you are the parent of a young child, you probably know who Maisy is. She's a mouse with a duck, a squirrel, an elephant, and a crocodile for friends. Why the crocodile isn't trying to eat the others is beyond me, but that's life in Maisy's world.Both of my daughters love the Maisy books; there's something about their simple stories and colorful pictures that even appeals to adults. The books are short and easy to read. But, the stories are never obnoxiously simplistic, like so many other books for small children.This is great to read at bedtime, esspecially if you can convince your child to pretend they are Maisy going to sleep. Maisy's preparing for bed and her preparations include a trip to the potty. The first time you see that page, it's actually kind of funny. This is one of my daughters' favorite Maisy books."
5,"simply perfect, the way young children's books should be","The first time I came upon a Maisy book I thought it would completely bore my son. Luckily, I gave it a second try around 1-year and marveled when Maisy's Train became a favorite for weeks upon weeks. Now, at 19-months, Maisy's Bedtime is read many times every night. It's one of the only books that I read without modifying any of the words on the page. They are simple, yes, but it's exactly what kids under 2 eat up. I love the small moments of intrigue...where IS panda? And what DID Maisy forget to do before going to bed? Now my son sits on the potty on his own before going to bed and laughs when Panda is found sitting on the windowsill. Wonderful!"
5,There Is A Light That Never Goes Out,"Bright new indie label Know-It-All Records should be commended for releasing a CD that blows away all the wannabes---Starsailor, Badly Drawn Boy, Elbow, and the like! Good music is always universal! Whether you like Dave Matthews and his clone John Mayer or Ed Hartcourt and Ryan Adams---Peter Coyle is king of the hill!"
4,Not what I expected,"My daughter loved Hello! Goodbye! by the same author, and from the description I thought this would be similar. Unfortunately, this book did not have the wonderful illustrations that Hello! Goodbye! did and my daughter was not at all interested in this new book. The illustrations are small and penciled with only a bit of color. The variety of circumstances described in the book are also more limited. We definitely prefer Hello! Goodbye!"
1,School promotion video,"Jason's ego is certainly a driving force for all that he does. I met him many years ago and have to agree with the previous reviewer about his self-promotion. There is a lot of street in Jason and it shows in his approach to training and promotion of the style. I trained with Sifu Francis Fong for years and feel that you are better off finding a better source of information about the style than this video, such as a good school in your area.Jason does have a beautiful looking school, however the beauty does not hide the fact that the school is used as a conduit for self-promotion such as the two videos that Jason has produced. Additionally, how in the world does a 30 minute video cost $30? Save your money."
2,Werewolf: The Devil's what?,"At first the movie title and description seemed to me atractive. That's why I bought this product. I love werewolf movies. I think werewolf genre has a lot of material to develop a very good story, but latest werewolf movies have been poor. Is it very difficult to produce a good movie?, I don't think so. I'm very dissapointed with this film. Bad performance and poor special effects."
4,Frank Sinatra's Greatest Hits tape.,"Good Cassette tape of Sinatra, I am not a huge fan, but Songs like Strangers in the Night and It was a Good Year appeal to me despite my age which I feel has nothing to do with knowing good music, which this is."
1,Description is wrong,"Good paper, but nowhere does it say here that this paper is only printable on ONE side. The other side has the HP name and logo all over it."
2,"Matches the item photo, not the product name","The item is clearly titled Matte. I received a box of Premium Photo Paper Soft Gloss. So it matches the item photo but not the item title. Then when I tried to return they gave me the runaround. For under $10 I just kept it - not worth my time to return - but if you are looking for the HP Premium Photo Paper in Matte (which is terrific and I highly recommend), THIS item is not it. This stuff works fine, as far as gloss goes, but is nothing in quality compared to the matte paper referenced in the product title. Too bad."
5,Great fun,"I applaud the creators, the writers and the actors, this is pure entertainment, TV at it's best! It's funny and politically incorrect, you can't get any better than that."
5,"Raw, honest and simply beautiful.","Set in south London at the end of the last century, Michael Winterbottom's Wonderland follows a few days in the lives and loves of three twentysomething working-class sisters (Gina Mckee, Shirley Henderson and Canadian actress Molly Parker who are all excellent). Winterbottom's free-form directorial style is reminiscent of mid-'70's Altman/Rudolph ensemble work like Welcome To L.A.And If the intimate use of camera and razor-sharp editing are not enough, Michael Nyman provides the film with one of the best music scores in recent memory (or perhaps since his work on Gattaca).Paul Thomas Anderson probably wept the day he realized just how gracefully one can absorb the spirit of Short Cuts without drifting to the contrived, incoherent excesses of Magnolia."
3,Just too morose,"This is one of those ""small"" films that I want to like. But like many ""realistic"" portrayals of working class London, it is just too morose. Every one of the characters is wallowing in unhappiness. The film is very well made, and you can empathize with several of the characters, but this is too much of a downer. This version of working class life has been done too many times before. ""Realistic"" need not always mean ""depressing."" Think about seeing ""Me and You and Everyone We Know"" instead."
3,So-so,"This product doesn't really cling to your skin and pull any but the most shallow dead skin and/or blackheads. It seems very thick, but dries very thin, easily tears when pulling off. Doesn't seem to do anything more than a mild scrub. I was looking for something a little more agressive in grabbing the blackheads, esp. considering the price."
4,"The real story, at last!","This book is surprisingly even-handed and fair-minded. Jessica Lynch comes off as likeable, a little naive, and brave in a way that's totally different from the ""Rambo Jessie"" that the government talked about. (I don't know what ""griff44"" is talking about below because Lynch specifically says that she feels uncomfortable with people describing her as a hero.) Bragg is a great writer, and this book is about a person, not a legend or anything like that, so I think it'd be an enjoyable read for anyone regardless of their feelings about the war itself."
1,Hypocritical,"I can't believe Jessica says she wants her privacy when she has not said no to being on numerous talk shows, Magazines, Letterman and the Glamour awards. Her actions are very hypocritical. If she feels like the other soldiers deserve the attention then why is she taking all of it? I don't think she's a bad person and I certainly feel for what she went through but she is profitting off the backs of dead soldiers. That's the bottom line. She needs to step out of the limelight and go back to her private life..."
4,Smith: Tunesmiths,"Being an ""old school"" country music fan and more importantly a fan of Carl Smith, I loved this video.It has a nice variety of '50's performers performing a wide array of the old style country music with a little country humor thrown in.It appears to be comprised of 4 different shows and sometimes the end of one is cut off a little too quickly, but it doesn't hurt the quality of the video-which is very good.I would highly recommend this video to country music fans, as well as the seller (choad777).She was more than willing to correspond with me concerning other videos she has and was courteous and prompt. She even went that extra mile to provide detailed information that I am sure took her some time to obtain.In short, buy this video from this seller. You won't be disappointed."
5,The 20th Century's greatest yacht designer surveys his life,"This is a charming and insightful autobiography by the living legend of 20th century yacht design. It is beautifully produced with many glorious photographs and illustrations. But its outstanding quality is the warmth and modesty of the writer which shines through his personal account of his contribution to yacht design and the highlights of Sparkman & Stephens' record over the past 70 years. Chapters on his early years, the breaks he had as a fledgling designer, the Americas Cup successes, the wartime development of the DUKW, his philosophy of design and approach to rating rules for yacht racing will enthrall a wide readership.Owners of S&S designed yachts - and many others besides - will doubtless be captivated by this book. No wonder the first printing is already a sell-out."
3,A True Story,"Sticky was astonded when he realised that this was the life story of a porky guy he knew. Though he doesn't wear the crown anymore (now a G-Star cap), would rather eat sticky rice than hamburgers, he's still got that dopey look on his face. An instant classic"
1,Cliche anyone?,"Please. If you wasted your time on this book, seek counseling immediately. The title alone tells us all we need to know - the author favors trite cliches over substantive thought and has never had an original idea in her life."
1,Pointless,"It is unclear what and why the author writes. She obviously has nothing of importance or substance to impart, and her personality is uninteresting by all standards. Most people overcome stronger adversities in life and they do it with infinite more grace. Why the author feels her life is more remarkable than others is really mind-boggling. Reading this book is a waste of time and buying it is a waste of money. There is really no message in this book and the author, despite her much self-praised legal training, fails to build any minimal argument on any of her potluck of topics.Simplistic, at best; merely stupid."
5,A wonderful book I really recommend you to buy!,"There is a huge collection of Ethiopian Icons, starting from the 15th century. They are wonderfully illustrated and described. You'll learn a lot about this ancient christian country and it's history!"
5,Now one of my Top 10 CDs,"I love this CD. I've listened to it non-stop since I bought it.It is intensly emotional and soulful but still very calming and sweet. Love Show and Powerful are the best tracks, but they all are very good."
5,Replacement for LP,"I have this music on an album, love it. I love it even more now that I can play the CD in my car."
1,Try to find a replacement gasket,"Spend the money and get a better one.The gaskets trap and breed mold and are uncleanable even after you disassemble as much as you can. I would buy several replacement gaskets for the base and spout but they don't seem to exist anywhere.There should be a warning with this product. ""Discard machine when gaskets become disgusting and uncleanable"""
2,Update on my prior review...of 1 star to 2 stars,I contacted the company and they sent a replacement for the blade/part that screws onto the jar. It is much much better and I have made several smoothies with no problem thus far of it coming apart. But it is quite noisy and difficult to assemble/disassemble for cleaning..however now I do not have to take it apart every time it is used as I did before.
3,Great if you can push it fast enough to get bubbles.,"My son was bought this toy for his 1st birthday. He walks well but I guess not fast enough for this toy. The bubbles don't come out when he pushes it. They only come out when I push it pretty fast (too fast for him to currently walk). I hope in time he'll get faster and able to push it so the bubbles can come out. Regardless of this its quite a nice toy. I like the way it makes a mower noise and that it still continues to make this noise as you stop. Sounds quite realistic. As one other person said though, it's bad design in my opinion to put the bubble maker on the side. Why wouldn't they put it on the top so that the bubbles come out in front of the child? I don't understand that..? I guess I'd shop around and look for mowers with better reviews if I was looking to buy one myself."
1,waste of money,my son received this for his birthday. it doesn't work as advertised. makes tiny bubbles and just barely. big waste unfortunately.
2,doesn't work. waste of money,Doesnt make bubbles as advertised. The solution leaks on the carousel where the bubble should come out. Such a waste!
4,Classic Toy,"It cracks me up to read the reviews from people who complain that this toy makes a mess on their carpets. OF COURSE IT DOES! It's an OUTDOOR toy! Do you let your kids blow bubbles inside? Didn't think so. That's like complaining about chalk making a mess on your hardwood floors! Come on, people.This is an outdoor toy that spills -gasp- bubble solution if tipped. If you want to use it inside - first consider a toy vacuum cleaner instead - and then use it without the bubble solution.The second common complaint theme is that the adults seem to be standing around cursing Fisher Price while the kids are off having a blast pushing the mower around. Think about it. Just a little.As for myself, the bubbles work when we feel like filling it up and fussing with it, the two year old loves pushing it around - outside- when we don't. There are a bazillion other bubble toys she can play with either way. It's a good quality toy from a good quality toy maker."
2,Very disappointed,"Just like so many of the other people who have written reviews, I too saw no bubbles come out of the mower. I rinsed it out several times, walked 20+ steps and have even switched bubble solution. My 27 month old son likes to push the mower, but I could have bought any push toy to achieve the same purpose. I bought this mower for the bubble feature because my son loves bubbles. I was very surprised because Fisher Price has such good toys and I have been happy with them in the past with other toys."
3,Stopped working after a while,"This was very fun at first for my son and even worked on grass and pavement, but then after a few weeks it stopped working. I admit that I haven't taken it apart and washed it so will see if that does the trick."
1,waste of money,"My wife bought this toy for our twin grand-daughters. We tried it out ahead of time. To get any bubbles to come out, you have to walk very fast. They aren't going to be able to push it that fast. Even then, the bubbles don't shoot out that great. A lot of them hit the ground right away. We took it back and got another one, thinking there was something wrong with it. Same result. We even tried a different bubble solution. Didn't they test this thing out at the factory??"
1,GET A DIFFERENT MOWER,"We got this mower for our son for his birthday and it's NEVER WORKED RIGHT. The bubbles have never come out right, it's almost like the wheels don't have enough traction to turn the bubble wheel. My kids still pretend to mow the lawn with it, but there are better mowers out there, like thePlayskool Chompin' Mike the Mower with Bonus Zip the Trimmerwhich we got the next year and has worked even after being left out in the rain."
3,Fun but no bubbles,In order to make the bubbles come out all 4 wheels must be on the ground and pushed pretty firmly. It is too hard to get the bubbles to blow but the sounds make it enjoyable for my toddler.
2,Son Loves the Motor Sound but Useless for Blowing bubbles,"This thing never blew bubbles, NEVER! I fully intended to return but my son loves the loud mowing sound that it made (it does get very annoying indoors). I have read reviews about how to fix the blowing bubbles problem but if I purchase something, I expect it to be operational as the packaging instructs and not have to sift online from non-manufacturing sources for help!"
3,"Loved the idea, but such a disappointment","My 19- month old son received this from us for Christmas and loves pushing it around and the noise it makes, but is extremely frustrated with the erratic bubble action (as are we!)! After we primed it as instructed, we had one good blast of bubbles and that has literally been IT. Every once in a while we'll manage to get one or two complete bubbles, but for the most part the solution just foams and sputters. We have replaced it with about 10 different kinds of bubble solutions at this point and we've finally concluded that it's the darn mower, not the bubbles to blame. A real shame, because the idea is great but if your child loves bubbles the way our little guy does, this is bound to disappoint."
4,cool,"This was a gift for my grandson and he truly loved it. He was four last summer and still used it, now his little sister who is 2 is mowing and blowing bubbles in his place!"
2,So my brother hates me now.,"I bought this for my nephew for his birthday. He loves it. While the joy on his face while he's pushing this around the house should be enough, I cannot give this product more than two stars. For starters, it has NEVER blown a single bubble. Seriously, not even a little one. We followed all of the troubleshooting tips, and because everyone in my family is a know-it-all, that means there were three different adults who did the ""No, let me try it now"" approach from start to finish. Yeah, still no results. Also, this toy makes the most grating, awful noise. It's like having your own personal headache starter kit. And thanks to this toy, I've earned the title of ""Worst Gift Giver"" and ""Least Favorite Sibling."" Thanks, Fisher-Price."
2,Disappointment - BLAH!,"I'm going to give this toy 2-stars. I would give 5 stars for the amount of hope I had that this toy would be a hit for my 1-year old's birthday and yes - when he saw it his eyes lit up and he eagerly went over and ""tried"" to push it across the grassy yard. However, he was immediately met with disappointment. This lawnmower is very hard to push across grass. It has a lot of tension in the wheels. I guess this is necessary for the bubble-blowing mechanism to work. However, you must also push rather fast for the bubbles to blow so......my 1 year old abandoned this toy after about 5 minutes of trying to push. You can push it easier across pavement but then the bubbles still don't blow b/c he's not able to push it fast enough. BUMMER."
4,Not enough bubbles,"The Bubble Mower is well made and stands up to a lot of hard playing. However, I was disappointed in the amount of bubbles it emmitted when pushed. The child has to push very fast and continuously to achieve the amount of bubbles shown on the commercials."
2,the bubble generation does not work well,i purchased this toy for my grandson. he loved it. loved pushing it around. it has one problem.. the bubble generation working part does not work easily. the toy has to be pushed faster that a 2 year can walk and run to make any bubbles come out. thus defeating the whole purpose. for a fisher-price product it was a big disappointment. since we live in different states in the future i will send money to purchase any items locally so it can be returned.
3,don't buy it!!!!!,"I bought this toy for my son's two-year birthday and expecting the bubble coming out when he's playing. But, no, NO'BUBBLE AT ALL!!! And it's even worse, it is leaking!!!!! I'can not return it because I bought it way too early. But anyway it's worth the price for just a mowing toy."
4,The kid loves it...followed advice of other posts...,I followed the advice of several reviewers to use the 'cheaper' bubbles or bubbles that are thinned out a bit. It worked like a charm and the kiddo loves it. What's not to like?!
3,Good but not great bubble maker,"I was surprised that the bubbles did not come out easier for a toddler toy. My daughter cannot get the bubbles to come out herself (just over a yr old). It is not that easy for me either! The mower has to be on a flat area with all 4 wheels moving at the same speed at the same time, which is hard for her to do in our yard. She likes to push it for the noises it makes but get's tired of it quickly. I am surprised that it isn't made so that even if just one wheel moves the bubbles come out since not everyone has a flat yard. It is fun for her just the same and I'd probably have got one even if it didn't blow bubbles, just wish the bubbles came out a little easier."
2,Don't buy for the bubbles,"I too, never got any bubbles out of this thing. I went through all the trouble solving instructions, called customer service and they said I did everything right, and still never got any bubbles. I exchanged it for another in the hopes of getting it to work, but mower #2 also never produced bubbles. My daughter still likes it for the pretend play aspect, but I was very disappointed that she couldn't use it as a bubble blower, which is the real reason I bought it. Until they get the kinks worked out, I reccommend buying another brand."
1,Bubbles never worked,"We could not get the thing to make a bubble, ever!! My son loves to pretend mowing the lawn with his Dad, but forget the bubbles!"
2,"No bubbles, just mower.","This was a gift for my 3.5 yr old son. He is pushing it around outside as I type, not bothered by the fact that there are no bubbles coming out. I am bothered, however.For $20, this should most definitely shoot out bubbles. I have read the other reviews that suggest rinsing, etc. But the fact that there is a homegrown solution to the problem doesn't change the fact that this should work, it should blow bubbles.I am disappointed."
2,Uninspired and listless,"This is one of the worst Trower albums, in my opinion. I found it to be uninspired and rather listless, with none of the songs standing out as really great commercial songs or as examples of Trower's excellent guitar playing. The vocal style on this album is completely different from the established Jack Bruce-like sound. Additionally, the commercial style of this album is predominantly a keyboard/synth style, which is not what I buy Robin Trower albums for. If you want commercial Trower, stick to the guitar-heavy BLT."
5,Excellent addition to the series,"For those who are new to the Eyewitness format, it consists of thematically arranged two-page spreads of brilliant photographs on a white background. There is an intro paragraph in the upper left-hand corner, but most of the text is in the captions that go with the photographs. Generally, the biological sciences titles are the strongest in this series, since other topics often need a more organized progression of topics. You'll get a lot of information out of these books, but you won't get a systematic anaylsis.This series is strongest in the biological sciences, and this book is no exception. Excellently organized, extremely clear, and with incredible illustrations, this is a book to treasure."
4,great stick,"this is a great memory card for sony products...aside from the price compared to secure digital and compact flash, this stick holds its own...although this is cheaper than the sony brand the memory stick PRO in general is still priced too high and thus prevents me from giving it 5 stars...to those who say its not compatible w/ their sony stuff and blame sony for not warning them, those people should read their products more carefully before blaming sony...even when you buy the memory stick PRO, the package says it may not be compatible w/ some sony products...sony did the right thing by making a faster memory stick and if its anyone's fault it is all those techno newbies' fault out there who don't know what they're buying in the first place. basically, any sony product made since 2003 supports the PRO format"
4,Reliable and cheap,"This Sandisk 256MB Memory Stick flash memory card is reliable and it's a perfect fit for the latest Sony digital cameras and Clie handhelds. Sandisk designs their own memory controller circuits and they are good at making the Memory Stick compatible with all new Sony products. As long as you don't drop this or soak it in water (why would you do that?), you should expect many years of solid service out of this.BTW, you shouldn't be paying more than $40 for this, and as of today (1/3/05) Amazon has the best price. Shop around if Amazon price goes above $40 (before rebate).The Sandisk 512MB Memory Stick Pro flash card is also good, although some Sony products may not be able to use all 512MB. Check your Sony manual before you buy. Good thing Amazon does offer a 30-day money back guarantee."
4,Imation FlashGO! 2.0 will not recognize this card,"After reading the reviews I decided to get the SanDisk 256 MB Memory Stick PRO for my Sony DSC-F717, for which it works great. Unfortunately my imation FlashGO! 2.0 USB card reader will not recognize it, so I have to connect the camera directly to my PC for downloading pictures. Probably would not have bought the card had I known this in advance."
3,2 out of 3 worked,I bought 3 of the SanDisk 256 MB MemoryStick Pro. Two out of three worked great. The third one I will have to try to send back because it would not come up on my camera. There was some sort of problem with it. I will be contacting Amazon to see about returning this memory stick.
2,This memory stick won't work in Sony Laptops,"Although it works to take and transfer pictures from the camera, I can't put it into the Memory Stick slot of the laptop as with other models. I don't know why this won't work but it is very inconvenient."
5,Excellent Series!,"If you are into disaster movies & tv....this is a perfect gift for yourself or any weather related lovers you know! So glad I found this, I gave it to my husband for Christmas & we both love it!"
3,Not Popular Science,"As a science graduate and experienced teacher of A level Chemistry and GCSE Science I thought this book would be a nice overview of what is going on (and has gone on) in science. How wrong I was.This book flips from some nice historical detail and context to some very complex ideas in a wide range of disciplines. The transition is not smooth and I felt in the turn of a page I went from being firmly in my comfort zone to being completely out of my depth.Atkins can describe things with skill but he has bitten off more than he can chew in trying to cram so much into one book and the bits that he misses out were the links between school level and graduate level science, which unfortunately are likely to be the bits that his readership will be most interested in.With better editing (or choosing of content level). This could have been a good and informative book. Unfortunately, it was interesting in parts but unreachable in others."
5,A highly succesful review of science's best ideas,"The author sets a really hard goal: to pick the 10 greatest ideas science has sprouted and verified. For the most part the author achieve his case.All I can say is that it's a great book that gives you good insights and nice rules of thumb for abstract hard concepts. The first chapter, Evolution, is not as good as the rest and I highly urge you to keep reading, if you want something truly engaging I recommend any book by Dawkins. But DNA, the second chapter, quickly makes up for the first chapter. It's truly iluminating and well written.The rest of the chapters are enjoyable and informative (albeit if you know more than entry level of the subjects you'll find some of the simplifications a bit teeth-grinding.It is, without doubt a must read for anyone who wants an intuitive yet correct view of modern science. It's by no means through but it lies just in the fine line of not enough and overwhelming."
5,Just what I needed!,"I've had this mini fridge/freezer for a couple of months, and I have no complaints so far. It fits in my small office corner perfectly, and you cannot beat Amazon Prime's free shipping on top of the already reasonable price!"
4,refrigerator,"I like the refrigerator and it got here fast. But, it had a dent in the side. I did not want to mess with returning it and waiting for a new one."
4,A film Noir-DIGITAL,"For those who like story told in flashback, this is the movie to watch.Me and friend who are B-movies late 40s too mid 50s noir film buffs,enjoyed this one.Please note! the guy on the cover box may look central-american,but he's Fhilippino.Shot in the Philippine's."
2,Not that great,I thought this was going to be home videos from graceland. Instead it was the daughter and son talking about the video they took of Elvis and his friends when he would come visit their father when he was stationed in Dallas for the Army. It could of been good - but the daughter and son were so boring and i wish they would of stopped talking and just let us watch the home movies. Don't waste your $$
1,"If you want to learn, this is not the book.","I should have known that Reader's Digest is not the organization to look to for becomming informed. This book was a condensed version of facts about wildlife. The habitats on most animals were either incorrect, or very incomplete. In fact, there were very few species even included. If you are looking to get more information on your state's bird, forget about finding it in this book. If you are looking for all the members of the wolf family, forget about it. Basically, you should just forget about buying this book! If you want to actually learn, try finding publications from organizations dedicated to wildlife."
2,Something of a Disappointment,"The songs in this album were just not that great. The lyrics were not very singable (and indeed some of them didn't even scan properly.) The music also suffered quite a bit from a lack of Irish instrumntation. Most of the music seemed to be just standard, cookie cutter Broadway show tunes and not very memorable ones at that.The cast did very well, though, considering the poor material it had to work withAll in all, it looks like this play was a lost opportunity. The story of Grace O'Malley is a compelling one and deserves to be told better than it was here."
2,Avoid This Book,"This book is seriously deficient in depth of coverage. While it is nominally 264 pages long, only 144 pages are devoted to matters of substance. The rest is either ""historical notes"" or bibliography. The latter takes up 84 pages.Chernick is a shameless name-droper. Even the 144 pages that I've characterized as ""substantial"" are filled with citations and irrelevant details (such as the years in which his Stanford fellow students completed their dissertations).My advice: save the $90 and seek a better book."
5,Will My Pet Go to Heaven,"This book has universal appeal. Which one of us has not known the heartache of losing a beloved pet? Like the Wohlbergs, not many of us have escaped this pain. I admit I cried as I read about the car hitting Jax, Kristin and Steve Wohlberg's small dog. As I read, I remembered with unexpressible sorrow the drowning death of my family's toy terrier, Little Chief, even though it had been 40 years ago! I remembered exactly how I felt then and how very much I wanted that special small animal to live again and not be dead. Out of this experience of sorrow, many people will ask as I did, ""Will my pet go to heaven?"" Steve Wohlberg's Biblical search for the answer to this question is thorough and uplifting."
4,A Guaraldi enthusiast,"The ""Blue Copy"" of this book is quite good and should satisfy most advanced/intermediate players. The contents contain many of the standard Peanuts pieces. I was disappointed to find, however, that it does not contain ""The Great Pumpkin Waltz"", which was one of the main reasons I purchased the book."
5,Sounds of the time,"MALO was a sound that kept the latin sound alive. Carlos was going through the early stages of his ""guru"" influence. Raul Rekow, Jorge, Luis Gasca, Arcelio, created a sound, a mood, an identity which everyone could relate. MALO maintained my interest (and pride) with their subseqent albums. Again, with the groups like AZTECA, TIERRA, SAPO; airplay and exposure hurt their potential. If you had the opportunity to see MALO live, you know what I'm talking about. MALO is another example of what Latino pride sound like."
1,For completionists only,"Short and enigmatic, Prunings/Accurings consists of a long nugget of gibberish prose -- apparently taken from Genesis -- that is pared back over several stages to what is eventually one word, ""IN"". The book is presented to be read either front-to-back, in which case it is ""Prunings"" or back-to-front, in which case it is ""Accruings"". Granted, that's a cute gag, but now that I've told you, you don't need to buy the book.I recommend this book only for people who are interested in owning the full set of Kostelanetz's poetry/fiction. Nobody else needs it."
4,musical notation,Great entry level software for writing out songs and parts. The selection of instruments in the templates could offer a bit more than is available but that is a minor point I suppose.
1,Completely and utterly useless to me,"I bought this from CompUSA and it didn't have a serial number inside. It's an $89.99 paperweight.If a company can't even make sure that a serial number is securely in every box when they ship it, they aren't worth your money."
5,book,great Christmas present for a teenage boy who likes this sort of reading material. It will keep them occupied for a while.
1,Book not arrived yet,Still waiting for the product to come...........If the product won't be coming by the end of Oct then pls do not keep sending me message asking for comments. This is the second or third time I'm being ask for comments.
1,Black & Decker Garment Steamer,This was a pretty pitiful attempt at a garment steamer. Very little steam was produced [meaning the shirt being 'steamed' didn't have a prayer of losing its wrinkles] and I'm returning the item which was a Christmas gift to my son-in-law.
4,Beautiful voice,"This is soulful pop and rock at its best, an album of impressive versatility. McCluskey's vocals are warm and engaging, strong at times, then dreamy then vulnerable. The instrumental mix is particularly imaginative, and includes guitar, piano, organ, strings and even slide guitar, whilst the rhythms include pop, country-rock and reggae. In between, there are exquisite atmospheric moments, little trip-hop infusions that add a special charm. My favourite songs include It's Been Done, Love Is Stronger Than Death and Sleep On It but her exceptional voice makes even the weaker material an enjoyable listening experience."
3,NICE!!!!!!!!!,"I HAD NEVER HEARD OF ANGELA UNTIL HAPPENING UPON HER SONG ""IT'S BEEN DONE"" PLAYING ON THE SOUND SYSTEM. HER VOICE CAPTURED ME. VERY INTERESTING I THOUGHT, SO I GOOGLED THE LYRICS AND FOUND THE SONG. I DEFINITELY BELIEVE IN GIVING A PERSON THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT, SO I PURCHASED THE CD BASED ON THAT SONG ONLY. THERE ARE A FEW GEMS WITH ""IT'S BEEN DONE"" BEING ONE OF THEM. ""LOVE IS STRONGER THAN DEATH IS A GORGEOUS ROCK BALLAD"", ""LONG LIVE I"", AND OF COURSE HER SOARING AND AIRY VOCALS ON THE POPULAR ""SOMEBODY GO LUCKY"" ARE JUST BEAUTIFUL. THERE JUST AREN'T ENOUGH SONGS LIKE THOSE ON THIS CD, AND SOMETIMES ANGELA CAN BE DOWN RIGHT EXPLICIT E.G ""SUCKER"" OVERALL THIS IS A CD I WOULD RECCOMEND TO ANYONE WHO'S TIRED OF THE COOKIE CUTTER POP PRINCESSES, AND WANTS TO ENJOY SOME REAL HEARTFELT MUSIC."
3,Great but lasts only 2 - 3 years,This worked great. I loved to coffee and everything worked fine until about 2 to 3 years later. The thing literally fell apart. If you can't afford an expensive mashine for a few years this might work for you. It is great and makes great coffee. Just expect to get a new one in a few years.
2,Does not use AAA batteries,"I purchased this low-power laser pointer to use for playing with our cat - so as to not blind him. I wanted a pointer with easy to find batteries, and the description said it uses AAA batteries. It doesn't - it uses a stack of puny button batteries. It's not worth returning.This pointer is otherwise ok if you want an anemic laser, and sometimes you do!"
1,Wasn't what I wanted,"I thought this video would contain his full seminar. With the mixture of his video and personal life...it just wasn't what I thought it would be. I threw it away, I was that disappointed."
2,A portrait of a fallen hero...,"Another of Gene Simmons products that seems to be throw together in five minutes. Some parts suffer from really bad picture quality, the editing is not very good and graphic effects seems to be done by a five year old. You don't really get to see that much from the lectures in Australia (and it's probably just as well) and most of his house we have seen already on MTV Cribs. Cribs at least did not portray him as a meglomaniac.As a Kiss fan since 1978 it's really hard and sad to see how Gene ""whores himself"" these days. Instead of consentrating on the only thing he has been successfull with, KISS. Most of his business ventures since the 80's have more or less been complete failures.I'l give it one extra star just because I find the demos that are used as background music interesting."
4,Edamame,"This book has a lot of great ideas for flavor combinations using edamame. It's not only Japanese anymore -- the book shows recipes with Italian, Mexican, tex-mex and Asian flair."
4,Not as good as the earlier books,"I wasn't disappointed in this installment, but it could have been better. The ending leaves room for more action oriented tales in the series, which is the author's intended direction. I've said this in a review of another LotB book, but I really would like to read something that focuses entirely on Valentine's past."
5,awesome,personally i love this dvd its fun and Julianne keeps things interesting. Im in decent shape and it gave me a pretty good workout and taught me some interesting moves
1,Disappointing,"The dance routine itself is great but I can't really ""dance"" because I cannot hear the music. If I turn it up, you just hear the squeaky ""Woo's"" attack your ears. There is almost no instruction or cues. I'll stick with Jennifer Galardi who gives great cues and you can hear the music so you can get into it. Hard to dance without music. I could tolerate the lack of instruction, if I could only hear the music and get into it. So disappointing because the routine would be fun."
1,Boriiiiing. She screams a lot and no dance.,"I'm so mad with myself for buying this. It's ridiculous. There's no decor at all, just a dumb place with nothing attractive. There's no production at all.She screams most of the time so there's no exciting music to make you go for it. I'd rather put on some nice music on my iTunes and dance freely.I wish I could return this and never look at it again."
3,really OK,She made reference to throwing your hair it more of a pretty girl flaunting her body the moves were just flirty and don't see me losing many inches
2,"love Julianne, but not this video","This is not any easy work out for the faint at heart. My 19 year old daughter and I watched it we laughed at how hard it is to keep up with...Love Julianne....but, come on!"
1,looking for a workout.,"I was looking for a workout , Juliana just dance is not a really workout. so I will not recomend this DVD at all.Emilatlanta, GA"
1,Not worth it,I've been taking ballroom dance lessons for about 5 years. What she does on this video is NOT ballroom dance. It moves way too fast - there is not enough camera time on what her feet are doing. Very disappointed.
4,wife,Got this for my wife to do a little extra cardio. She enjoys it and has been using it ever since I received it.
2,I got my copy autographed!,"Here we have an album by Star Trek's ""Uhura"". Sure, she can sing, but to be perfectly frank, most of the songs here aren't very good. Most of them have ""outer space"" themes, and they are pretty cheesy. And can you handle TWO versions of Nichelle's tribute to Gene Roddenberry?(one is sung, one is spoken, both have the same backing track.) The CD concludes with a 25 minute interview with Nichelle, which is sort of interesting to hear once, but I can't imagine too many people will want to hear it more than once. This CD will really only appeal to Star Trek fans, who of course are the only ones who would buy it anyway."
2,"""Down To Earth""","Nichelle Nichols is a respected artist, known mainly for Star Trek's delightful Houra. If you want to buy an album of some very good songs from her, better look for the Creation records / Rev-Ola compact disc re-issue of the 1968 recording ""Down To Earth"". A smasher. Check it out!"
3,Less than a year of use.,"I love this iron when it was working. One day it just stop heating up, I am looking for someone to fix it, I paid to much just to throw it out."
4,Eye Chart,We needed a wall eye chart that could be mounted at eye level with a patient seated at 10 ft. This chart did the trick and was inexpensive. It can also be moved easily should we need to do so.
3,Easy-to-read story of the adventures of King Arthur's court,"The language used by the characters is antiquated and difficult to follow, the characters lack depth, and the writing lacks the descriptive power to make me feel part of the story. That said, I'll read anything about King Arthur for the familiarity of the names and the stories about the characters."
3,An OK album,"The most memorable track from this album is SENTIMENTAL LADY which Fleetwood Mac member Bob Welch would re-record solo for his 1977 album FRENCH KISS. The latter recording would be a Top 10 hit. On this album,the track was recorded in a slightly faster tempo and a different key. FM wouldn't become superstars until 1975 when Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham joined the band. They are Americans like Welch. When Nicks and Buckingham came in,out went Welch. The other songs are good. On the cover,we see a typical winter or late autumn(early to mid-December) scene. BARE TREES are like people with hairless scalps."
4,Great guitar and good singing,"This is Danny Kirwan's Fleetwood Mac featuring Bob Welch. Kirwan's guitar and singing truly shine here. It's a shame that the relationships didn't work because the next few albums without Kirwan were weak. My favorite songs are Bare Trees, Child of Mine and Sentimental Lady. If you like Kiln House you will really like this one."
5,One of my favourite albums ...,"We live in a time, when paintings have no colour, words don't rhyme. And that's why I'll travel far, 'cause I come so together where you are. 1973. Round trip from Center Harbor, New Hampshire to Woonsocket, Rhode Island. If there was only one tape in the VW that day, I'm glad it was this one."
5,Music of Johnny Mandel,"Bill Watrous is a jazz trombonist. He is perhaps best known by casual fans of jazz music for his rendition of Sammy Nestico's arrangement of the Johnny Mandel,a ballad ""A Time for Love,"" which he recorded on a 1993 album of the same name. He's in his 60s now(62) but has been playing & recording for almost 38 years.This is primarily a slow to med. tempo album arranged by Shelley Berg who also does the honors on piano.The personnel are too numerous to name, but there are four trombones & three trumpets plus bass & drums.I think the ballad, ""A Time For Love"" (like all the tunes are by Johnny Mandel (as if you didn't know) is done in big band style & Bill's trombone with his gorgeous tone, (smooth & full) take the cake. First Prize! Whatever.As for the other tunes, Cut 1 ""Low Life"" is a gas. They do a great job on ""The Shadow of Your Smile"" as well. Even though I am a jazz guitarist, an album like this makes me want to play TB. Oh well, you make your choices & you live with 'em."
3,Same as the Weight Watchers!,"This is the exact same cookbook as the Weight Watcher 5 Ingredient 15 Minutes Cookbook. There are more pictures but the recipes are ALL the same. It is a good cookbook, I like it-- I just didn't need two."
4,Great Easy Cookbook,"This is a great, easy cookbook for anyone looking for simple dinner ideas. It does call for some frozen/prepared ingredients (such as diced pre-cooked chicken or frozen chopped onions) but if you want to use fresh ingredients you can, just plan on spending a little more time on the recipe. Most recipes have just a few simple ingredients (never more than 10) and take either 15 minutes of prep time, 15 minutes of cook time, or 15 minutes total time. The barbeque meatloaf is fantastic! The book includes desserts, salads, an extensive meatless entree section, and chicken, beef, and pork options. I haven't made anything out of this cookbook that I didn't like."
5,Quick & easy menus the whole family liked.,"I have a lot of cookbooks with easy or quick in the title that I never use because either the recipes are not healthy or are not tasty or both. I use this Cooking Light cookbook EVERY week for at least 3 of my weeknight meals. Not only is everything easy to prepare, healthy, and tasty; it is easy to search through the book to pick my menus for the week before going to the grocery store. Everything is spelled out for you. I would use this book even if I had plenty of time during the week to cook."
4,Bought these to make sun tea and they work great,"I bought these glass jars to make sun tea and they're perfect for that. They hold slightly more than 1 gallon and the seal the rubber gasket makes is airtight. They are surprisingly easy to lift and maneuver when full and the quality of the glass is very nice. Very solid, doesn't feel thin or brittle. I'd definitely recommend them for anyone who wanted to use them for sun tea or any type of canning."
5,Great jar,"I purchased these jars to make liniment that needed to be aged. I had experience with screw top jars that got stuck when the liniment got on the threads, and in one case, actually ate through a metal lid. No such problem with these jars - sometimes there is some suction action that holds the top on, but I can usually pop it off. I had one jar that didn't seem like it was going to seal properly, but after the seal got a little wet, it worked fine. Jars have a good solid feel. Gallon jars are not that easy to find, so I was happy to find these."
2,Double-feed a big problem,"This machine has tremendous trouble with feeding. One third of the time I get a double feed which means that I have to rescan the whole stack. Also, when you scan certain paper sizes (ie my Verizon bills) it crops the sides (where the dollar amounts are) since the bills are of a size that is one of the pre-determined sizes. Of course, I could measure the size of the bill and imput it manually, but that would be a tremendous hassle if I have to measure every paper and imput its size (why not just make the scan area a little bigger (ie letter size). It is not that user friedly and you really lack flexibility by not having a twain driver. The speed is good and the two sided scanning a plus. Resolution is poor and the machine overall seems to be overpriced for its cheap construction."
4,astronomically aclaimed,"This is a very long fetched movie, but it makes you feel good to believe that it really could have happened. It deals more with teamwork then blacks and whites. it does a good job of looking passed this fact and finding the best man for the job. Many family issues are also brought up in this film which can still be considered to happen in a time like today. If youve never seen this movie id highly recomend that you rent it if you are into football fairy tales."
3,Denzel gives a great performance,"""Remember the Titans"" is a film that deals with segregation. What I like about it, is that it did not just focus on one perspective, it shows both sides.The film is about a (all-white) football team, that gets a new football coach (Washington) Due to the towns segregation of African-Americans. Without giving away any spoilers, the film is about Coach Boone trying to get both Blacks and Whites to play together on the same field, and respect each other off the field.Overall, ""Remember the Titans"" is a good movie that deals with segregation and team-work."
2,Bad News Bears Meets Rudy,"I think someone forgot to include reality in this movie. It's like an afterschool special. I understand that there are different movies for inspirational reasons, i.e. Rudy, Lucas, and The Mask, but Disney does not need to be in charge of making a movie based on real events. I know that just because a movie is not made by Disney does not mean it is totally realistic, but I do think that people used cuss words a little bit more than they did in Alexandria ""Disneyworld."" This movie is good for about an 9-12 year old. Any older and they will understand that this is fluff and not take it seriously. As for the adults who view this movie and like it, I have a little advice: watch Saving Private Ryan and get a dose of reality."
5,AWESOME!!,This was absolutely the best movie I have ever seen in my life. I love how the teammates work together to become one team and accept each other for who they are on the inside not on the outside!!
1,Are u Nuts,"Ok, I hope you made a mistake making it 999.00, cause if u are selling this for a grand ur full of it."
2,Seen It All Before,"Denzel Washington stars as a coach brought in to lead a hitherto white high school team, circa 1971, to both victory and racial accord. Well practiced at spinning dross into gold, the actor has enough authority to make you briefly forget the corruption of Gregory Allen Howard's script -- he can clear a frequency for himself amid even the worst static. As one of those black characters who's never wrong, essentially because being wrong would make him human, Washington eases past the thicket of platitudes, slipping by child actors whose scene-stealing tactics would shame Walter Brennan and playing off the rest of the otherwise likable young cast like a seasoned session man tapped to mellow the upstarts."
5,"An awesome movie, that you won't get tired of watching!","In school, I have watched this in a record of about 4 or 5 of my classes. Every time I watch it, I love it even more. I even had my grandma go out and buy it for me in WIDESCREEN! This is an awesome movie, that I most certainly, will never get tired of viewing maybe 1,000 times. The DVD is also worth it. It was released in two versions WIDESCREEN and FULL-FRAME. It's better to watch it in widescreen so you can see all the football action.This movie is all about a school down in Virignia I think, where white people have not yet gotten to understand that blacks are people too. Well, anyway the school has a great (all-white, up until 25 minutes into the film) football team. Denzel becomes the head coach of the team when the other coach leaves (but then for some reason comes back).The movie has a couple of hilarious one liners, and zingers. This is one of the best live-action Disney films, I've seen in years. Keep them coming Disney!"
2,Short attention span theater,"This movie has great production values and many fine moments. The only problem is they are nothing but fine moments with nothing really tying them together. While we were watching we kept saying ""when does the movie start?"" The whole first two thirds of the movie had the feel of your typical five minute movie introduction (only far longer). Basically The races are at each others throats, then the team comes together, then begin the cycle again. The whole thing is trying too hard to be inspiring without first making sure that is is a good movie. There are tons of wonderful moments in this movie but the whole thing feels like a collection of themed music videos than a movie. It was only worth watching once."
4,helpful for my project,"Drums of Bora Bora cd was very helpful for a little project that I was doing. It was exactly the kind of music I had been looking for, especially with the drums"
5,Perfect for storage.,"These jars a great for storing dry beans, rice etc. I also use several of them for my flour, sugar, etc. instead of canisters. I love the tight seal."
5,"This is a beautiful knife - light, durable... perfect!","This is an amazing knife. It slices perfectly and is light in my hand. I do a lot of chopping, and I mean a lot, since I'm a Raw food chef. Therefore, I need something that isn't going to get heavy in my hand and that will last a long time. This is perfect! I've had my knife for about two years now."
5,An all time favorite musician!!,"I started listening to Bill back in the 70's and wish they would re-release his earlier albums. His music is listenable, intelligent and I never get tired of it."
1,Disappointing,"(Note: my iron is actually the F63E, slightly newer. It includes a water gauge.)I bought this hoping for a good, old-fashioned iron with enough heft to actually remove wrinkles from clothing. Silly me. It does have the heft I was after, but the steam output is wimpy, at best. The instructions say to gently bump the iron several times to get the steam going. If you do that, you're rewarded with one or two weak sighs of steam, then nothing. I actually bought mine at Ace Hardware, and will be returning it. I sure wish someone would make a good-quality, old-fashioned iron!"
5,Just like the old days.....,"Skeptical: Regarding all the supposed improvements in modern day technology-- I have, in the past, bought cheap and paid dear. One disposable after another...:""leakers"", all of them- until this excellently crafted iron. It has the structure and weight of the chore-maker my Mom inflicted on me many moons ago. Who would have thought that I could miss it? But I have --all the cheap reproductions do not not hold a candle to this one. Great steam, ultra-smooth surface and the weight needed to get the job done. Happy productive ironing all-- and KUDOS to B&D P.S.-- No leakage"
4,Excellent Educator resource,I purchased this product to help as a resource item for my students since I am a religious education instructor. The item was in good condition when I purchased it and is user friendly. I would highly recommend this product to other religious education instructors.
2,Doesn't work very well...,"I had high hopes this product would solve my lint problem in my dryer. I hate the idea of a fire developing. Though I struggle to make the product work because of the collapsing nature of the end of the hose, I do not think it was worth the price. I have to continuely stop & pull it out to squeeze the end because it will no longer work. It is better than nothing but could be improved."
2,vacuum cleaner attachment,you have to hold it on the vacuum hose because it does not fit snug if you don't hold it it will fall off. Go to a vacuum repair place I am sure the have the right one.
1,ssamson,"This was a waste of money. First of all, it didn't fit on my vac hose, which is a standard size. So i taped it with duct tape, hoping to use it. When i turned on the vac, the hose collapsed. Great idea, but poor materials."
2,Dryer vent vacuum cleaner attachment feedback,"I am glad you are giving me the opportunity to give you feedback on the plastic tube dryer vent cleaner that I purchased from Amazon.com, which was sold by Crucial Vacuum, Inc.I have to agree with the comments above, in that the tubing collapses with the suction from the vacuum. Perhaps a gentle wire spring coil could be inserted in the lower portion of the tubing to keep it open, similar to the way vacuum cleaner hoses are built. I tried to use it, and it did get some old lint out, but I'm afraid it was not one of my better purchases.It wasn't very expensive, so I will overlook the problems. I wish, however, that I had a coil spring to insert that would keep it open. It would be very handy to clean dryer vents, and a/c floor vents. As well as under refrigerator, washer, etc. Maybe I will try to cut back on the suction volume next time I use it. Maybe if the suction isn't so strong, it will work better.Teresa"
2,Could be better,I like the idea but it needs some sort of adjustment attachment so it can fit any vac. I wanted to use my little handheld vac and it would not fit.
1,Lint Lizard DOES NOT WORK!,"I would not recommend the Lint Lizard to anyone. We have a two year old (top of the line) front loader, and the Lint Lizard wouldn't clean anything beyond the shallowest area of my dryer vent... and even THEN I had to maneuver it JUST RIGHT to get MOST of the built up dust. The hose is curved and very stiff, so it makes it hard (if not impossible) to move around in the proper direction. I gave up. I am returning the Lint Lizard and I'm going to give the ""Gardus LintEater Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System"" a try -- it has a 4 1/2 out of 5 rating on Amazon."
1,Lintlizard,"The lint lizard , Was not at all what the commercials show it to be. Pretty cheap piece of plactic and doesnt work!"
1,Horrible product,I bought this vent cleaner to attach to my Vacuum. I have a Kenmore Vacuum. It didn't fit on the hose first off. But after much pushing and shoving I finally managed to get it on there. But than as soon as I did the clear hose collapsed so no air could go through and it didn't end up cleaning anything. I tried everything to keep that hose open so that I could clean the vent but nothing worked. I'm in the process of trying to get my money back.
1,Don't waste your money,It was a piece of clear plastic tubing. It did NOT fit down into the dryer vent. Basically it was junk.
2,Closing Tube,I found the plastic tube on the dryer vent vacuum cleaner attachmentDryer Vent Vacuum Cleaner Attachmentwas too soft. It kept collapsing on itself. It was very annoying and didn't do the job it was intended to do.
1,Waste of Money,I purchased this hoping for the best and expecting the worst. The worst won hands down! The entire contraption is just plain old junk. The hose that goes into the drier is so cheap that as soon as you connect the vacuum it collapses from the suction. I just put the mess in the garage hoping that some day I could find something to use the material for in the future!!!
2,Dryer Vacuum Hose,"This is a great concept...but did not work for me. The plastic hose is long enough to go to the floor. The hose is folded in 2 places (for packaging) which crimps the hose. I wrapped tape around it to keep it open. Now I attach hose to vacuum...when I turn the vacuum on the hose collapses - I was never able to vacuum up anything with the hose. But all is not lost..the attachment (about 18"" long) that fits on the hose and then the vacuum hose is very handy to vacuum in cabinets around items. This review is on the product not the seller...the seller provided excellent service."
1,CHEAP!!!,"The picture shows the tube as having some rigidity, when in fact it has NONE. The vacuum's suction collapses the tube which defeats the whole purpose of this item & could end up doing damage to the vacuum. Not to mention it arrived folded thereby creating permanent creases in the tube. Definitely NOT worth the price & shipping."
3,Disappointed with the delivery,"This book was supposed to have two volumes. I only received one. I'm still awaiting Amazon's response to this, but for one volume this is way overpriced."
5,The Best Cherries You'll Ever Eat!,"I got hooked on these thing while living in Switzerland. They are not you're average chocolate covered cherries. These wonderful little pieces of decadence have what I call ""three stages."" First is this dark chocolate that isn't too rich, but has just the right mix of sweet and bitter that melts on your tongue as you bite down. Then there's the first impact of the Kirsch (cherry liquor, only better). And finally, the chocolate, cherry and Kirsch all mix into this wonderful burst of flavor. If you haven't tried them, you've missed something special!"
1,"Received damaged product twice, gave up","The product received was a box of 25, with a small pack of 5 Mon Cheris. The small pack of 5 was perfect, the box of 25 was damaged. The chocolate had been allowed to heat so the chocolate melted and all the Kirsch had leaked out. There was no liquid in the package, no stickiness, and the cherries were dry so the product was damaged before shipping to me. I wrote a complaint, and was promised a replacement. Weeks went by while I waited for them to recieve a fresh shipment. This time the candy was shipped in a box with an ice pack, but the candy was damaged in the same way. I will shop elsewhere in the future, no longer trusting the quality from this vendor."
5,"a ""must have"" brush!","I have a sort of in between ""short"" and ""medium"" length hair. I wanted to have rolling brush for my bang. OK. Why didn't I get this brush sooner? I now ditch my culling iron, rollers (both hot and cold), and even Denman. I think I am definitely going to get other sizes for side and back in future. Love, love, love this brush!"
4,GRABS AND DRIES!,"I love this brush, it has a great hold capacity for bangs specially. I have really long hair so I use the larger one for the rest of the head. A feature that I appreciate is that hair does not get tangled up in it."
3,Works but item feels cheap,Product works but seems fragile and hallow. I wish the product I purchased was more sturdy rather than feeling like it will break off at any moment. My former brush was 5 years ago and feels more sturdier than this brush :(
5,It is my third brush like that. I love the way it gives my hair body.,I found a great price on it. I was looking every where trying to find this brush. I am happy I finally found one.
5,Actually quite nice for long hair,"I use this brush with the small but powerful Babyliss Tourmaline travel hair dryer for the perfect amount of volume. I don't even clip half my hair up first (a must with other barrel brushes). My hair is about 4 inches past my shoulders and this brush gives me great volume with smooth, curled ends.Be careful where you store it though, cause bumping your hand into these spiky bristles hurts a LOT."
4,A very enjoyable read...,"Robert Heinlein had one conspicuous flaw in his fiction: anycharacter could, at any time, use the interjection ""So?"" as a complete sentence retort, and the tone conveyed was always that of Heinlein's own speak or think in exclamation points, and the tone conveyed is usually that of Tiggre's own un bridled optimism coupled with his disbelief at the pervasiveness of conventiona l wisdom.But I have read many times over every word Heinlein wrote, and whil e Tiggre isn't his equal-- NO ONE is-- he has produced an exceptionally fine re ad, one worthy of any big-name storyteller. It is important to bear in mind tha t while the possible (and completely unknowable) outcome of the Y2K problem mak es a fascinating backdrop for the novel, it is the story itself which is paramo unt.And a swell story it is, indeed."
2,Not recommending,no directions. Powder is hard as a rock. I think I have a bad/old product. But who knows since there isn't any directions???
4,The Match,"This video has just been released in the U.S. and is very hard to find. (I think Amazon may be the only source!). It has been available in the U.K. for a couple of years. Produced by Pierce Brosnan's Irish Dreamtime, the plot focuses on a ""football"" (soccer in the U.S.) match that will determine the fate of a Scottish town's pub. I enjoyed watching the main characters overcome physical and psychological issues. Although I didn't find the video ""raucously funny"", I did laugh several times. It's too bad the video is so expensive. I was afraid it would not be available for very long so I paid full price. It was worth it."
4,"For those ""Full Monty"", ""Brassed Off"", & Ripping Yarns types","Luckily, I caught this on cable, since 1)I'd never pay the current price of a new video & 2)I'd never pay the current price of a used video, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Semi-whacky, semi-touching, all the Scots accents (and attempts at Scots accents) made me want to watch the family dinner scenes of ""So I Married An Axe Murderer"" again. What happened to Scottish films? In the early-mid 80's they were very happening, but after exploding on the scene with ""Local Hero"", ""Letter To Brezhnev"", & ""Gregory's Girl"", but except for a quick teaser with ""Trainspotting"", Scotland seems to have concentrated their collective energy on things such as forming an independent parliament, rather than focusing on important things, like film. Time to prioritize, but until they do, efforts like this are good. Richard E. Grant is in his smarmy persona here, & I enjoyed him nearly as much as inHow to Get Ahead In Advertising"
4,A great value and as good as the more expensive ones...,"I hate paying for the expensive steering stabilizers because they are so easy to bend due to the way they are mounted on the front axle. So I figured I would just buy the ""cheap one."" I have been pleasantly surprised. It's performance have been as good as any pro comp or rancho I've used in the past. It keeps me tracking straight with 35"" tires and a lift. I think it would be hard to beat this value."
4,Good slippers,I bought these for my wife who has worn them for a couple of months. She is happy with them. They have a bit of a smaller fit than expected.
1,Fell apart after 2 weeks. Poor quality.,"My excitement quickly turned to disappointment when, after less than 2 weeks, the insert inside the slipper came out of place, started bunching up, pulling away from the inside, and causing a tacky mess to appear on the inside of one shoe. I attempted to reposition it, but after a day it was doing it again. Apparently the adhesive used on the inside of the shoe is not made to withstand long wear, and was no longer holding the insert in place. As a stay at home mom with hardwood floors, I wear these a good portion of the day. Maybe they would hold up better if I was only wearing them for short periods, but even my $5 WalMart slippers held up better than this with equal wear!! I hadn't even washed them yet. This was my first time of buying dearfoams, and it will be my last. The quality was simply not worth the added price. I will try another brand, and do not recommend these."
4,4 Litter canning jar,"I have 13 in my pantry. I also have the 4 and 5 liter along with small ones. I use them for cereals, flours, sugars, pasta, noodles, beans and other items I use almost daily. Keep bugs out, air tight and the wide mouth is large enough to get measuring cups or my hand in and out easily. I enjoy cooking from scratch. Just slippery when wet. Easy to clean."
4,Not a Kid,this controller is fn to use in the dark and the bulbs are very bright. the shoulder buttons are an improvement in my opinion because they are spread apart and you will not accidentally push both shoulder buttons at once.
3,A little odd...,"Although I enjoy the subject of near-death experiences, this story got a little out of what you might call the grip of reality. Sharp talks about battling demons (literally!), beams of light emanating from her chest, and having psychic visions. I'm sorry but I think the author is a little bit ""off"", to put it tactfully."
1,This book is little more than propaganda!,"This book praises Schwarzenegger, and the Republican agenda. It, however, fails miserably to tell both sides of the story. It talks about the way that Grey Davis mismanaged the state (I agree on that one), but it fails to accurately portray the financial costs of the electricity crisis. It doesn't tell you that although Davis began taking steps to get back money that was stolen by Duke, Enron, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, and others, Schwarzenegger quickly turned it around and kept California from recouping any of its losses!!! The book tells you how terrible the climate for business is in California. If it is really that bad, why does California have the fifth largest economy in the world? This book is little more than propaganda, and I believe no one should buy this of their own volition."
2,A Mile Wide But An Inch Deep,Very disappointing for anyone who is not a novice to the world of design. Lots of big theories but little insight. Spend your hard-earned money on Tufte or Wurman instead
4,A solid 4 stars,"I'm a big Gary fan and I don't know what took me so long to finally get this CD. It needs a few more listens, but my overall impression is a good one. First off, I'm a guitar guy so the vocals are just fine...I didn't buy it for the vocals anyway.As for the guitar work, a lot of it is very good I'd just like MORE. More solos, longer solos, more noise, more in your face. Gary gets a bad rap sometimes for being a boring pentatonic scale solo'er, but I love his cranked Les Paul style and melodic solos. I would have liked this to be more of a real balls to the wall guitar album, after all Kevin is not around to reign him in! But hey overall it's a good CD and the tune ""Outlaws"" is worth the price of admission all by itself. I just wish more of the songs were like that one."
5,Definitely the one....,"This book is the best I've run across...Its easy and very thorough, with pages and pages of patterns...Great for quick and easy identification....Easy to find facts and makers..."
5,STAINLESS FLATWARE GUIDE,I HAVE GOTTEN ALOT OF USE OUT OF MY STAINLESS GUIDE AND WISH IT EVEN HAD MORE PATTERNS IN IT. BOB PAGE AND REPLACEMENTS LTD DID EVERYONE A GREAT SERVICE BY MAKING THIS BOOK. www.replacements.com
4,How to save time....,"This book saves time narrowing down your search for the right flatware!! It can take forever to figure out what you want to eat with for the next 10+ years if you rely on department stores to have a decent selection, cause that's very hard to find!"
2,Disappointing product and sloppy shipping,"My Pilates CD was too short for the hour-long class I teach. Most Pilates classes are at least 50 minutes long, and the CD was only about 38 min. Also, the CD case was badly cracked when I received it."
2,Rust should try sleeping,All the fine stuff; and then this. Oh well at least he doesn't spread it out over all his albums like the stones have done with the last half of their body of work.
5,Very touching and Very lovely. She's an angel.,Very touching and very lovely. You'll learn more about Diana and her biography. This is a definite recommendation for your free time. I haven't seen any loyal princes or princesses that are this determined to change the world for the poor and the unfortunate children.Very lovely written.
5,the very best,"OK My parents got me a RADA knife many years ago Now I own most of there knives and tools these pairing knives are awesome gifts just like all RADA knives the blades are amazing two or three slides on the sharpener before using and there razors always take an edge and function flawless for pennies on the dollar compared to some brands, WHY WOULD ANYONE PAY 70,00 FOR A JAPANESE KNIFE IF YOU CAN BUY AMERICAN FOR 15.00???????"
5,Leanring to Pay Attention,"Patricia Rose Upczak's delightful book about synchronicity proves that when we pay attention to the world around us, we will begin to see the everyday miracles that occur in all our lives. The stories she relates with such a deft hand remind us that we all have the innate ability to recognize and undestand signs. She guides us back to a time when animals and plants were our guides to a deeper spiritual understanding and suggests that we can reclaim this ancient heritage. She includes a very helpful Signs and Symbols Dictionary. This is a wonderful book for all who would hear the whispers of the universe and follow the signs.I highly recommend it."
1,What you see is not what you get! Buyer beware.,"What is pictured is an album cover and across the top is written ""a three record set on two compact discs"". Just what I wanted. What I received was three audio tapes with a note included that said no returns or refunds. Since I don't have a tape player and this was not what I ordered, I contacted the provider who basically said ""too bad, so sad"". Amazon apparently does not stand behind products from other suppliers. So I'm stuck with something I can't even listen to. The worst part: this was a gift for my husband. He was thrilled that I found the CDs and was very disappointed when the tapes showed up. Be careful what you order from Amazon."
5,Awesome concert in 1080i/60 and 5.1 DTS HD MA / 5.1 Dolby Digital / PCM 2.0,"Couldn't agree better than with the previous feedback. This is an awesome concert with lots of EWF and Chicago's catchy tunes. What a synergy between the two bands! Video is presented in 1080i/60, which is totally acceptable for concerts. It's brilliantly filmed. Audio is either 5.1 DTS HD MA, 5.1 Dolby Digital, or PCM 2.0. Both 5.1 surround sounds are great, but no doubt the DTS HD MA sound is superior to the Dolby Digital one. As far as concerts on Blu-Ray are concerned, only Shakira would top this one in my opinion. Better get both!"
5,A Really Fun Show!,"This is a great DVD! Of course if you're not 40 or 50 years old you probably don't know who these guys are. Both EWF and Chicago put on great shows and demonstrate that their musical abilities are still strong in this video, although Robert Lamm's vocals are considerably weaker than they used to be... but then again, at his age, whose isn't? All the old hits are on this DVD and some tunes are performed by both groups together. The non-original guitarists for both groups are noteworthy. If you liked these 2 groups back in the 70's you will love this video."
2,I MUST BE MISSING SOMETHING..............,"I'LL BE QUITE FRANK ! I'M NOT A HUGE EWF FAN BUT I GREW UP ON CHICAGO TRANSIT AUTHORITY, THE EARLY MUSIC.THAT SAID, WHO IS THIS COVER BAND CALLED ""CHICAGO"" ? I TRIED TO WATCH THE CHICAGO PORTION OUT OF RESPECT FOR THEIR NAME, BUT I FELT LIKE THIS WAS NOT REALITY. WELL, THIS IS REALITY AND IF YOU WANT ""CHICAGO"" THIS IS WHATS LEFT. SAD BUT TRUE. I'LL BE TAKING THIS BACK AND TRADING IT IN TOMORROW. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE THIS 2 STARS IS FOR THE EFFORT AND ENERGY OF THE MUSICIANS.........."
3,Wrong Format,I purchsed this item but had to return because I did not realize it is for an HD DVD and you need an HD DVD player to see it. I bought for my husband but we have a regular DVD player and it was not compatible. Be careful and make sure you have the right format before purchasing this HD DVD.
3,I Expected More,"I like Chicago...and I like Earth Wind & Fire...but this performance left me disappointed in both. Music quality fell short. I liked the brass, but the transition was rough between numbers. I guess I expected more."
5,Great Blu-ray!,"Actually saw this tour in Hershey, PA, summer of 2004. Good to have finally purchased this Blu-ray to remember how good this concert was. If you don't have it, get it."
1,Worst garbage disposal I Have ever had,I bought the Insinkerator Evolution based on reviews and recommendations. It is very quiet but it throws the garbage up on the stopper and constantly has to be clean. It takes a long time to grind most things and never does it completely. I am very disappointed in this product. I heard it was a new concept in grinding and I have had Insinkerator before so I thought it would be very good. It is not at all and I am very disappointed. I called their customer service and she said that that was the way it was designed and not much can be done except buy a new one. Not a good answer.
5,InSinkErator Evolution Pro Compact 3/4 HP Disposal,This is a very quite and well functioning product as you would expect from this manufacturer. It is efficient without taking too much undercounter space.
4,Very interesting,This book raises a lot of questions can the idolized America of our collective memory survive in the 21st century? Does the need to being stronger in order survive mean that we have to forfeit our national soul in the process? Can we still claim the moral high ground in an era where we have no sense of ourselves anymore? Is the current War a bungled effort on the part of the administration or part of a larger strategy to shut China off from the oil reserves that it needs to grow?Overall-I really can't get a handle on this book there are some liberal elements and some conservative elements but there are many uncomfortable questions raised that an audience may not want to consider but still need to be addressed.
5,A Delightful WWI Romance You'll Want to Read!,"Elizabeth Edwards, daughter of an earl, was betrayed by the duke to whom she was betrothed. After breaking the engagement, she moves to Boston with her grandparents. But to evade the man hired by the duke to stalk her, she answers a newspaper ad placed by a Nebraska farmer advertising for a wife.Ms. Fairchild pens an enthralling story of tenderness and true love when Elizabeth learns about life and love in Nebraska from the sexy farmer, Graham Ballard. I highly recommend this page-turner set in WWI, and I'm looking forward to Christa Fairchild's next release!"
4,Great biography,"I read this because I've read other works by Cooper and think he's a first-rate historian. I also didn't know much about Jefferson Davis, except the things that get repeated in history books. This is a well-researched and well-written biography, and I learned a lot. Like one of the other reviewers, I wish there'd been an epilogue; Davis dies, the end. When I finished the book I thought of a line from a poem by Robert Lowell about another famous figure: ""He was one of us only, pure prose."" I don't know if that's because of the way Cooper presented Davis, or because Davis was, when it all comes down to it, ""one of us""--no great hero, but someone who did the best he could.The person who struck me as the most interesting was Davis's wife Varina, who captivated men as different as John C. Calhoun and Oscar Wilde and was an intelligent, educated, and strong woman. I hope somebody's working on a new biography of Varina!"
5,Great buy!,"Product was as described, honest sale. Would definitely refer this bookstore to others from what I've experienced. Thanks and have a blessed day."
5,Strong's is number one,The Strong's Concordance is a very valuable tool in studying the Holy Bible. I have enjoyed this and plan on many more years of learning as this really breaks every thing down.
4,what actually worked?,"I've been taking this product for about 3+ months. It seems to help, but I've also started a series of stretching exercises that help reduce pressure on my joints. What caused the improvement? I don't really know because there is no ""control"" experiment. I guess I could stop taking the hyaluronic product and see what happens, but I don't want to mess with what success I seem to be having."
4,Know what you're doing,"take your time, route your lines correctly and make sure the nipple on top doesn't get pinched and you're all set to go.The installation was easy and the end result was a money saver. I ended up having to redo everything because I was to confidentduring the first attempted instillation. Good product though!!!"
3,"good singer, bad CD quality","I strongly disagree with everyone who says Leon can't sing. He really is a great singer... but I must say, the quality of this cd is really bad.But I think it's wrong to make others think he's a bad singer from just reading reviews of people who have heard some bad quality recordings, and then not even bothering to listen to anything else by him. They will be missing some great songs..."
4,Great travel mouse,"The Wireless Pocket Mouse Pro is ideal for a travelling laptop as the USB receiver slips inconspicuously into the shell of the mouse. While a little small, it still fits nicely in my large hands. The biggests issues I have are that is is sensitive to shiny sufaces (moreso than most optical mice) and that, when the batteries begin to run low (which takes a while), the software starts acting funky."
2,poor quality,"The mouse and especially the USB adapter are cheaply made. The USB adapter is made of very thin glued plastic that came apart putting it into the mouse and closing the door. Getting the mouse apart to insert the batteries was not simple, the latch was not easy to open and then get the top of the mouse off. Overall the quality of workmanship was not very good."
1,Bad mouse,This mouse has a problem with tracking. At times it tracks well at other times it skips badly. This is a piece of junk that I'm throwing out.
3,Needs own drivers; Short battery life,"Ergonomics are fine. Weight/shape/optical are fine. I got this mouse to use at work on a daily basis. My workplace tech people ""installed"" it for me. I was having a lot of trouble with the mouse until I figured out they had not installed the driver specific to the mouse; once I got the correct driver, the mouse has been functioning as expected (except for the horizontal scroll always coming on). I do store the usb port inside the mouse each day when i leave for the evening so that the battery life can be conserved. Despite these efforts, the batteries only last me about a week or so. While this may be fine for travel use, it is not fine for everyday use. I am going to have to replace it with another mouse."
2,For Hardcore Utopia Fans ONLY!,"If you are a fan that absolutely must have everything available by Todd Rundgren and Utopia then I suppose that you'll want this but anyone else should steer clear.I used to have a video tape of ""An Evening With Utopia"" and loved it.Unfortunately that particular show is not available on DVD. Since this DVD is from the same tour I thought that it may approach the quality of the video I used to love so much. Not EVEN CLOSE.The video quality is poor, the audio mix is often off and the overall look and sound is barely above that of a home-made video or an amateur concert video one may see on local access cable TV.So, like I said; This DVD is for hardcore fans only.If anyone knows of a decent quality DVD of Utopia from the same era I'd like to hear from them as I find this DVD almost unwatchable."
3,Well...,"This is probably the kind of stuff that only serious Todd / Utopia fans would like. The video quality is very 80s and, in that context, pretty good. But it just doesn't hold up particularly well. But, it's Todd, so what can you say?"
1,How bad can it get?,"I'm sorry - I love Todd and Utopia and have had the distinct pleasure of seeing them live many times in the 70's/80s. And the collection of songs here is good - not great - but decent enough. BUT - the DVD sounds as though it was mixed by big bird! One moment, all that can be heard is vocals then too much drum then too much (fill in the blank) but wait ! Todd is about to solo! I can't hear it THEN it's all I can hear. You get the point - I was extremely disappointed at dropping the $18 for this clunker of a dvd. BUMMER!"
5,Eye candy for the kids,"This clever, fun to read-along and `nice to look at' dvd makes it one of my favorites for the Halloween season. It's nice to see a genre that is usually focused on the scary element redirected to something the kids can relate to as well as learn from. After playing this at a birthday party for my son, I was surprised to see the kind of attention demonstrated by the kids. I wish I could get that attention when it comes to chores!Good dvd to own and play for all your young ones."
3,Uninspirational - two and half stars perhaps,"I'm disappointed in this book. They are mainly country styles and outdated. Even the so-called soft contemporary and scandinavian belong to another era. If you are looking for creative styles or sleek modern for city living , forget it."
3,BEER GUT...Not Great For Santa!,"First, let it be said: This is exactly what is looks like in the pictures...a big belly! When my Santa put it under his lovely Santa suit, it looked like he had drunk a case of beer a day, beginning 365 days ago. We were sorry we had chosen that padding, but the shipping back cost more than the belly, so we kept it. My Santa does theatre, so maybe it will be just right for one of the up-coming shows this season."
1,Not what I wanted,This iteam was not only late but it was weird. It wasnt rounded like it is in the picture. It was werid and sqaure. I was trying to be Juno for Halloween and I looked like Juno about to give birth to Rollie Pollie Ollie's square friend!
3,"Not hard to use, but waste of battery.","It's really easily for anyone who usually need to shine their shoes. But, it needs to prepare a lot of battery for your daily use. However, if you use rechargable battery, that will be fine. It needs 3 battery but four, that's what we need to notice."
4,Beatles Like I've Never Heard Before,"I borrowed this CD from the library out of curiosity and what a delightful suprise. The interpretation of Beatles music is wonderfully simple - I especially love the different variations done with the same tune in some of the pieces giving them a fresh sound. Harmonies between cello and violin in ""Norwegian Wood"", ""Across the Universe"" and ""Girl"" are mesmerising. Mostly played with a slow tempo, this is great soothing music after a stressful day. This CD is definitely worth purchasing for a twist in popular Lennon-McCartney compositions.4 stars for song selection, otherwise 5 stars for interpretation."
5,Rehabilitated my HP Zd8000 Laptop,"I purchased this Hitachi drive to upgrade from the existing 100GB 5400RPM drive in my laptop. I also ordered the Apricorn EZ-UP-UNIVERSAL EZ Upgrade Universal Notebook Hard Drive Upgrade Kit, which you will need to make an exact duplicate of your old hard drive on to the new one. The upgrade went smooth and now the old hard drive serves as a clone back-up of the new one. This Hitachi runs pretty quiet and FAST. I love it. I installed it into my *2004 HP Pavilion ZD8000 Pentium IV 3.2GH w/2GB RAM running XP Pro srv pack 3* and the increase in speed is noticeable. Startup takes about the same amount of time (even after turning off non essential services), but all other processes go much faster. Programs open in a flash. My plan was to get another two years of top performance before purchasing a Windows 7 machine and this HD makes that happen for me. I'm in love with my laptop all over again."
1,Night Gallery Review,Great series from the past. Hard to find sweries and something from the past you will never forget!
1,Misleading Title,"The title and cover art of this DVD titillated my hopes, but is is basically just a string of bad movie trailers interspersed with some bad comedy; and it does end (thankfully) at around the 82-minute mark."
2,Endless Orgy for the Goddess of Perversion,I did not like this DVD. I think I was not wright win I saw the cover and was looking for a movie about the Goddess.
1,"Offers great promis, but has very little to offer.......","I looked very much forward to receive this book, as from deacribtion it seemed to be that practical guide I needed in my work. But all the way through the book it repeats itself, and what is repeated is so selv-evident, that you continue to skip pages to search for some INFORMATION. A lot of words, a lot of schemas, that I cant imagine anybody would waste their time on filling in, as these are also just an endless repetion of basically the same questions."
4,Wet my appetite - but not fully satisfying,"When I read this, I already knew a fair amount about modern legal theory. I was hopeing to learn about postmodern legal theory. Since most of the book was about modern jurisprudence, and since he didn't really have much new to say about that, I was a little bored and disappointed. But I must say I found the postmodern discussion fascinating. I'm going to have to do some research to find out if Feldman has any other books that more fully develop his thoughts on postmodern jurisprudence.You would most benefit from this book if you're new to legal theory. If you already understand modern legal theory, then most of the book is a rehash. For me, I guess I give it four stars because finding good discussions of postmodern jurisprudence is so difficult, and Feldman did such a good job with that."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This book is a real yawn. Nothing interesting here at all. Author simply rewrites the lyrics and themes of country songs using academic jargon and vocabulary. Extremely boring attempt at translating the artist, songs, and themes into complicated descriptions and analysis. Very text book."
3,Good for a light read,"Like the rest of the Lucy Stone series, this one is fine if you're looking for something ultra-light. But I can't warm to the character of Lucy Stone or any of the other characters, really. Something is lacking in character development, and Lucy Stone frankly comes off as rather unlikeable, with a husband who seems to be back in the 1950s. But for something easy and light, the series is fine, especially if you're a mom and enjoy something familiar."
1,Its not worth its price,"What you find in this book you can find in SOLD( Synopsys On Line Documentation). I do not think that fundamentally this book offers any added value over what you find on SOLD. One cant make the claim that the explanations are clearer either, SOLD does a pretty good job of explaining. On the timing analysis (Primetime) front there is no mention of latch based designs/timing rules at all.In summary, if you are a student, you might find it useful, but its not worth the money, you probabaly can get a better understanding using the online documention. If you are a professional and want this as a reference, you will find it pretty disappointing."
1,very general; very short; and way over priced,"This book is very general even to readers who are unfamiliar with the topic. It is a waste of money. It is extremely short, I read the whole book in one day. It has bits and pieces here and there, but no fundamentals. This book is not useful, even to starters."
1,yuck!,I have made several recipes so far and they all tasted terrible. Yes they were easy but the recipes are so simplistic that it is not worth printing the recipe. This book is definitely quantity over any sort of quality. You get a huge collection of bad recipes!
2,It helps me in a pinch,"I have made a few things so far and made up some of my own, I think things could be a little more on the healthy side. I don't like to use so much potatoes, caned soups and other things with loads of sodium. I think some of the recipes could be written better. To much guessing on my part as to what needs to done like,One dish called for kidney beans. Did not say to rinse or not just x amount of beans, x amount of potatoes. Did not say what kind? Did not say if you need to peel them? So guess work on my part and I don't have time for that. After all that is why I bought the book...."
4,easy cook,My husband actually browsed this cookbook at a friends and read it cover to cover. Asked for it for a present. He actually uses it!
5,Great slow cooker book for all experience levels.,"This is a great cookbook. I bought one for my daughter and one for her boyfriend, both of which are medical school students with very little time to cook. They have both used the cookbook every week since they received them and as a mom, it makes me happy to know that they are eating good, healthy food, rather than fast food."
1,Just plain awful,"I tried to give this no stars, but apparently that isn't an option... I have only made a few recipes from this book, but after reading the recipes, it is a terrible cook book. It features complete lack of organization, many recipes are duplicates of others, no commentary on the recipes. The few things I did make were so bad we threw them away without even serving them. I'm not even selling mine on Amazon, I'm putting it in the recycle bin."
2,Forget it is right!,This is a redundant collections of recipes readily available on the internet for free.
5,great crockpot recipes for busy women and hungry husbands!,The recipes are proven family recipes submitted by various individuals across the USA. Tried and true...easy to follow including simple ingredients and easy preparation. I have a copy and gave it as a birthday gift to a friend and she loves it also. Great for working women and women who don't particularly like to cook.
5,As Good As They Come,"This set of four videos, featuring analysis by Professor John Erickson of the University of Edinburgh, is a model for the intelliegent presentation of military history via video. This medium is especially appropriate where, as was the case on the Eastern Front, everything was done on a large scale, both in terms of the distances and the number of troops involved in complex military actions.Professor Erickson is especially impressive -- knowledgeable and unbiased, yet modest, his sole obhective is simply to inform and to talk about a subject that obviously fascinates him.If you have any interest in military history, or even if you have none, you should consider buying these videos. They are superb.UPDATE: NOTE: This program is available in four separate DVDs titled The Russian Front:The Russian Front: Barbarossa - Hitler Turns EastThe Russian Front: The Road to StalingradThe Russian Front: From Stalingrad to KurskThe Russian Front: The Battles for Berlin"
3,Too big,I thought it was smaller than it is... I really do like the design but it makes me feel like Madonna wearing a huge ankh.
4,Good quality / good value,"This Ankh is made well, and it is silver. It is 52 mm in height and proportioned correctly. This is a nice piece for the cost, and the supplier had it delivered super fast!"
5,A PRACTICAL AND QUICK STUDY GUIDE,"I played a lot of basketball before taking on coaching my 6 year olds' team, but I had never coached. I digested the basics of this book in about an hour and it was a roadmap to get me started. I keep reading and using it as the season progresses. Very very good for first-time coaches for kids leagues of about 5-13 years old."
1,"Do not buy this or any other ""mechanical"" scale.","Not only does this scale require a strange ""warm up"" period in which the reading will be WRONG until the springs 'loosen' but the thing broke within a week anyway. I tried adjusting it in a million ways, but it always gave me a different weight by a 15-20 pound variation from one minute to the next. The whole thing was a freaking waste. Please, I beg you, INVEST in a nice scale. Don't throw away your money."
5,Wonderful modern music.,"I originally love to listen to classical, easy listening, slow-pop and jazz music. This album was recommended by my friend, Rawitat Pulam from tsukuba-jp, was a superb music in my way. I like his playing style and his music. He made a great modern piano music.Unfortunately my local version (Thailand version) do not have a bonus (japanese) track. So, I have to buy from outside Thailand.I am another one who love your song, Maksim."
2,"Toy Breaks Easily, Not worth the Money","When I saw that this toy was wooden, I was hopeful that it would be sturdier than some of the plastic toys that my 3-year old son has broken. I was sadly disappointed. This toy is made out of very flimsy balsa-type wood. In the 3 weeks since Christmas, I have already had to glue two pieces back on. Also, the wood is decorated with simple foil stickers that are already peeling off. My son desperately wanted some sort of astronaut toy for Christmas, so I bought this one. He seems happy with it, but only because I have repaired it for him."
5,"Keep your pet safe, protect your sanity, and your carpet","Perfect for the initial housebreaking phase with a puppy or dog. Control their environment, and you'll find both you and puppy are a lot less stressed. This height is great for smaller breeds. A 6ft tall person can easily step over and in.Never really bothered to set it up permanently, just used D clips to attach a separate Precision crate. Gate latching system is solid. Easily folds up upon itself for transport."
3,DVD MINI-SERIES; INTO THE WEST,"Punctual delivery. Good story but a bit plodding. The film quality of the DVD is very dark and it is difficult to watch, especially the night scenes. It is of interest that it is currently being aired on AMC and this problem is not exhibited there."
2,Not Into the West,"Was hoping to get this for 91 year old Dad for Christmas, but won't buy it until full version available!!!What a shame!!Thanks for the heads-up. Glad I read the reviews as I already saw full version on Satlyt TV. Thought that is the version I would have gotten!"
3,serious odor issues- but the company is reasonable,"I cannot recommend these gaskets because they have a strong chemical odor that does not dissipate over time. As a result, the food you store using these gaskets takes on that same odor - not nice. I can, however, add that Bonters wrote to me and offered to refund my money. Sadly, I no longer have the packing slip, so no refund is imminent. I will also say that the orange gaskets I bought through Bonters to replace these are excellent, just like the originals."
2,"They fit, but they stink","They claim to be rubber, but the acrid smell hasn't gone away even after airing them out for over 2 months. I'm not sure why no one else has noticed it, but I haven't been able to put food in the one jar I've been using as a ""test subject"" to see if the odor goes away. I'm afraid it will permeate any food stored in the container.If someone wants to try it, they fit clamp-down style Fidenza jars which I bought in the mid to late 1990's with wide mouths. The opening is on the jar itself is 3 1/2"".I'm buying something else with fingers crossed."
4,Replacement gaskets,"Couldn't find anything like this locally so I was grateful to find them here! I would have preferred the oil school red rubber ones, but they serve their purpose."
5,this product,the quality in this product is excellent-wasn't able to use it due to the fact that the rings were to small didntthink about measuring my jars
3,Gaskets,The size should be listed in the product literature. I had to stretch it to make it fit my bottle.
3,Nice product with quality control issues,"I was happy with the quick shipping on my purchase. The gaskets were also a good fit on most of my storage jars (one exceptional jar was too big). However, I was disappointed to see that one of the gaskets arrived with several parallel cuts in it, almost as if someone had used it to test a pair of scissors or a knife. It's still somewhat usable, but is clearly not going to be as durable as the others. At this price, it's not really worth the postage to return the product. I guess 5 out of 6 isn't too bad, but that's not what they advertised."
5,Very good game - but for a bit older kids,"This is a very good game. We've been playing it over the weekend, and it is everything other reviewers write - it's a strategy game, it's memory developing, it's engaging and it's very well made.However, it rarely takes less then one hour from beginning to end, and it's not very dynamic - not much happens in the beginning, so it's kind of drags for a while. I noticed, that the game was of more interest for the kids nine and over. Younger kids just don't have enough patience, interest and stamina to go through all game.I definitely recommend the game - but for kids older than nine."
3,A bit too much for young ones,Too complicated for our 8 & 6 year old granddaughters--we'll keep it for the future. It looks like it will be a winner when they're older.
4,Ravensburger Enchanted Forest - Family Game,"My husband and I ordered this as a Christmas gift for our 7-yr. old greatt-niece, and had it sent directly to her. We ordered it about 10 days before Christmas and she received it in plenty of time. My rating of 4 stars is for the ease of ordering and how quickly the gift was received. I haven't heard much feedback except that she ""liked"" the game--which is the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars."
4,A Continued Look at an Alternative America,"This sequel to Lion's Blood is a worthy addition. The characters develop and grow, and glimpses into other cultures propel the story. Anyone who enjoyed the first book should not miss this one. It definitely seems that there may be more volumes planned. Fans of alternative history will like this unusual story. The friendship of Kai and Aiden is thoroughly explored and intriguing. Steven Barnes is a very talented author.Michael Travis Jasper, author of the novel, ""To Be Chosen""Lion's Blood"
4,Guercino in Britain : Paintings from british Collections,This book is surely worth reading. It is a cultural substent within the artistic subject of the late 1600. The famous painter is right now one of the most quoted ones around the world. It talks about his distorted life which can be interpetated in a mad manner from somebody who doesn't really understand that mabie all artists can be different from the mass of people that we all know today. It can help us understand how really life went like in those days. At last I can say this book is good but it doesn't fulfill my art identity. I have surely read better books.
5,No more waiting...,"This iron storage bag is great. No more waiting for the iron to completely cool off before packing it. I go to quilt retreats, and inevitably, I forget to turn off my iron way in advance before packing. This case does the job."
4,NOT,Subjective of course/didnt like this book/just couldn't get into it for some reason os I passed it on..havent heard form the reader
2,Ugh! Not a fun story,"I only read the title story of this collection for school, and trust me, it was more than enough. I am sorry, but this story is boring and stupid. It is an easy read, and beautifully told, but the storyline is dumb. I didn't like any of the characters, and everything about the book is sad. I am a sophisticated person, and am willing to look beyond the surface of most books, but this one put me to sleep so fast that I am unlikely to sample any more of McCuller's works unless forced."
4,Questions not answers,"The ""lover and the beloved"" are described quite well in ""The Ballad of the Sad Cafe"". I enjoyed reading the story because the concept of the ""lover and the beloved"" is written in a way that I can understand and relate to. The rest of the story was not understandable to me. Why did Miss Amelia marry her husband? Why did she hate him? What's with the hunchback? Chain gang? What chain gang? Anyway-read this for the definition of love. For the meaning of love try ""The Little Prince""."
1,Useless book on DVDs,"If you are going to buy this book looking technical infomation concerning DVDs, forget it. This book is more like a review of movies DVDs, talking about released DVDs and the upcoming Aliens DVD set. In fact,less than ten pages are devoted to discussing technical aspects of DVDs. All things considered, this a waste of money, time and effort on a book dealing with the trivial aspect of DVDs. You are much better off reading FAQ DVD on the Internet."
5,A Vaulable Resource,"as an avid everyday visitor of the digital bits,this book is a welcome addition to any serious dvd fan's library.if you thought you knew everything about dvd,then you need to read this book and you will soon find that you'll be referring back to it again and again.it is simply a great reference tool for setting up a good home theater system,explaining what those ""black bars"" are,and how dvd works,and why widescreen is the way to go when buying any dvd.if you want dvd explained in plain language,then this is the book for you."
5,Well written and perfect for all user levels,"As a longtime fan of the 'Bits site and an 'early implementer' of DVD, I knew I needed this book. It's very well written and contains explanations of everything the beginner needs to know. There are many additional bits of great information for the more knowledgeable folks in the DVD community as well. The additional reviews and the in depth look at creating the Alien Quadrilogy is equally superb. I've already shown the book to some co-workers who are rushing out to get their own copy!! Very well done indeed, Bill and Todd!!"
2,Not as advertised,"This used book was advertised as ""like new,"" but it should have been advertised as ""good."" The corners of the cover were folded and frayed. Page corners were folded and it was written on with marker."
5,A treasured favorite,"When I first picked up this book filled with so many unbelievably gorgeous illustrations, I didn't think the content of the text could possibly live up to them. My daughter and I were pleasently surprised. It has become her favorite book and a wonderous journey for young and old."
3,Enough,"It may be the greatest set of all time, but they release ""Terminator"" movies on DVD and now Blu-ray more often than Arnold fathers children."
4,Great Gift,Great gift idea for those who are movie buffs! My husband loved the gift. Great quality. How can you go wrong with 4 blue ray movies at once!
1,Be careful,"I ordered this item to use on among other vehicles a 2005 Ford F-150. On the F-150 I slid the smallest tube down the dipstick tube just like the instructions said and when I went to pull it back out it would not come. I pulled hard enough to risk breaking it off (which I did not want to do). I called the tech support line and the guy said ""Yeah, some vehicles have a flap or other similar item that it can catch on, just depends. You'll have to drop the oil pan to get it out"" No warnings, let alone a list of problem engines are in the enclosed manual. In case a waste of money. The manufacturer will not give me a refund and the return period has expired with Amazon so a total waste of my money."
5,mityvac is the bomb,"i live in an apartment , man the mityvac is the bomb, easy to remove all fluids and replace the exact amount back in , perfect for transmission and no mess , this is a must have tool, thanks mity your the bomb"
1,gimmick and poor quality,I purchased this namely to save time on oil changes. I have performed two thus far with this machine and have found it to take considerably longer than conventional methods. Quality of unit is inferior
3,Top down oil change,Top down oil change is a life saver with the cars in our household. The Mityvac works well but there is a lot of pumping required to draw a vacuum and remove all of the oil. I wish i had ordered the version with the compressed air attachment.
4,"Good product, awful instructions","It took me about an hour to figure out how this product works, thanks to awful instructions. At first, I had all the problems other people have described: it was not working at all, at most I would get about a few inches of oil in one of the tubes. Did all the steps prescribed, still no luck.Then I started to fiddle with a silver latch on the top of the device. The manual calls it an ""expansion kit"" in the product diagram, but does not otherwise reference it, what it is for, etc. I found that as I flipped that latch, oil came gushing through the hoses and into the evacuator. At last, what a relief!As a result, I am quite happy with the product."
4,works well,"Have not had a chance to use it much yet, but what little I have, it seems to be much more efficient than other units that I have tried. It is relatively lightweight, not awkward at all, and overall pretty darn convenient. Having purchased other MityVac tools in the past, I expect good things from this unit. In the event it does need repair, the fittings and such are of a type that is readily available."
1,Must Be Bad Out Of The Box,I bought this thing to use on my Mercedes a few months ago. Last week I was going to test it for the first time but of course didn't which was a mistake. Tried to use it and I can't get the pump handle to go all the way down. The leaflet says to pump 10 times but with all 200 lbs of my weight on the handle I can't as there is a tremendous pressure felt. The best I could get was maybe oil in the tube 10 inches above the oil pan. I even bypassed the extract valve with tubing and could feel suction on tube going into the reservoir from the pump but nothing or very slight suction on the tube going into the oil pan. Called technical support and about all they could tell me was how it was suppose to work and I would have to return it to the vendor. I'm glad I didn't pay full price.
4,Make sure you check out the enhanced PC Disc 2!,"Every Galway fan must get the 2 disc set for their collection. The enhanced disc 2 allows you to view Sir James Galway in interviews, photos and showing you his daily routine. It was such a treat! I was so pleased with the pc option that it gets more use than the audio portion but all Galway fans will enjoy these cds."
4,Works,Worked. I have a Dell Inspiron 8600 with Linux Ubuntu Mint Edition.But could have used an indication of capacity somewhere on the thing.
1,Terrible Return Policy,"Make sure you will not need to return the product. Price $5, Shipping $5, if I wanted to return - shipping non-refundable + 20% restock fee (product in original packaging). Otherwise, out of 2 purchased products total $20, I was going to get a refund of less than $8............Rip off if you need to return......."
4,design good but could be improved,"I purchased this reader since it accepts a micro sd card and conceals it. I use a card reader as my standard PC flash drive so when I travel I pop out the sd card and use it in my motorola xoom. Most readers leave the posterior segment of the sd card hanging out that leaves it vulnerable if using as an everyday flash drive. This reader tucks it away well. My main complaint is that the head cap is designed to work with the base cover. Ideally I just want to cover the plug on the reader itself. In summary, if you only use micro sd cards and you want it concealed then the vivitar micro sd reader is best. If you want the reader to accept more card types then the blueproton is best."
5,Good stuff!!,"Class 2 or not, it has a fairly decent xfer rate.I'm happy with it and don't have to spend to much time cleaning roms off of my sd card each time I find something new to flash, can keep a bucket full of recoveries.I know someone said they had a problem getting this to work with their HTC EVO, but I have had no issues what-so-ever. Remember to format to the proper file type before you fill it up with goodies."
1,Cheaply Made and Didn't work,The plastic on this is very very cheap. I would stick with a brand name and avoid this like the plague. Along with the poor build quality came a non working item. It wasn't worth the money to ship it back.
3,Displeased and very disappointed.,"This is a functional flashdrive-like device. You can put your own cards in it and switch the cards. However, I am very disappointed by this product and although I gave it a fair star rating, I am overall very displeased with this product. I bought it not very long ago and the plastic is breaking. It's obvious that the plastic is cheap and it's a very cheap and poor design overall.In order to insert cards to it, you have to take off an encasing. I would suggest this only to people who are not planning on switching out the card ever and are planning on using it as a regular flashdrive only and even then I'm hesitant.If the plastic case didn't break, it would be a great product.If they sent me 3 of these for this price and it could last me for longer, I would be a much happier customer."
3,Very comfortable. But be very careful not to break them,"I got these for the added benefit of being able to change out the lenses. However, that feature is quite risky. I bought 2 of these, one for me and one for the wife. My wife broke hers while Taking off the existing lens. It requires a bit of force and is not as easy as one would expect. It's unfortunate. I decided to just keep mine with the yellow that it came shipped with, which defeats the purpose."
1,"Cheap frames, changing lenses risky","Didn't see any easy way to take out the lenses, figured they just needed some steady/firm force, and the frame ended up breaking. Thankfully Amazon has a great return policy, ended up going with frames that don't have interchangeable lenses."
5,Very nice for the price!,"These are very nice for the price I paid. Changing the lenses is difficult, and it doesn't include instructions, but other than that, they are great."
2,Disappointed.,"This is like the 35 other books about Netscape, Microsoft and the Internet. It's cool to be an engineer, work 400 hours a week, have no life, and drink Jolt cola. Yawn! Tell me something new. If you want something fresh, honest--something that is not a big PR job for the tech industry, try the new Burn Rate by Michael Wolff. Speeding the Net is a re-hash unless you have been living under a rock the last five years."
3,Average,The sound quality is good when the volume is low or medium. When the volume is high or very high it gets distorted.
4,Great Hotel room System,"The INMOTION Speaker System is geart for people who travel a lot. It's folds up in to a nice small,lite package. Easy to Pack in a Suitcase. AC or Battery powered. Will also Charge your Ipod when you use it with AC power. Also has a Line-in input( Iused it with a Portable DVD player worked great!) and aHeadphone Out. And can be used to Dock your Ipod as well.It isn't made to crack up the tunes to 11. But it will be load enough for most people to enjoy their fav tunes or a DVD( while out on the road.I Love mine, It will get a lot of use in Tahiti next Month.Cheers"
3,Terrific if you don't need a lot of bass,"Just bought this for a long trip to Asia. It's pretty and light, and the sound is good at low levels. Distortion comes when turned up a bit, and despite MaxxBass Technology, does not carry heavy bass lines very well."
4,2nd & 3rd Purchases - Very Happy w/ Product,"This is the 2nd & 3rd purchase I have made of the Altec Lansing inMotion Portable Audio System for iPod. I have been very happy with all of them. I bought one for myself awhile back and am only replacing it now because the power cord itself got damaged.I have purchased other iPod Audio Systems in the past, at least 3 others, (2 for car, one for daughter) but have not been near as happy as I am with this one. Actually, my daughter was so disappointed with her's that she specifically asked for ""one like yours""."
1,Not Rhino!!!,"Don't buy this!!! The product description claims it's released by Rhino,much like earlier remastered versions of Billion Dollar Babies and Welcome to my nightmare but all I received was an old Warner Bros. copy from the early 90's! It's the same thing,same poor ancient sound quality! I was prepared to buy the other cds under the other so-called 'Rhino flashback' series but I won't get suckered twice!Don't waste your money!"
4,Track List,"Disc 1:Jingo, Everyday I have the Blues, La Puesta del Sol, Hot Tamales, Acapulco Sunrise, Soul Sacrifice, With a Little Help from My Friend, Latin Tropical, Let's Get Ourselves Together.Disc 2:Evil Ways, Persuasion, As the Years Go By, Jam in E, Santana Jam, Travellin' Blues, El Corazon Manda, We've Got to Get Together/Jingo, Rock Me."
3,Voices from the Holocaust,"Voices from the Holocaust by Harry James Cargas was an ok book. I expected it to be more about the exprerience the people had in the concetration camps, rather than the books they wrote about it. I liked Simon Wiesenthals story about tracking down Nazi criminals. I also liked Whitney Harris's story because it was motr about the Holocaust than the books she wrote. I didn't like Arnost Lustig's story because it was more about his books than anything, it was very uniteresting. If your going to write a book called ""Voices from the Holocaust,"" someone who reads it will be expecting to read about the Holocaust, not the books someone wrote about it. My favorite story is Jan Karski's. I found it interesting because he talked mostly about the holocaust and things that happened there."
5,personal notes on F. Scott Fitzgerald,this short book provides insight into the personal life of F. Scott Fitzgerald from his confidential secretary. it's nicely written and a must for Fitzgerald fans...
2,Disappointed,"I was really hoping this book would solve all of my high-altitude baking problems, but it has not been as useful as I wish it were. First, I struggled with the numerous errors/typos in my first edition. While I was glad to see the corrections on here recently, I think I basically had tried to make every recipe that turned out to have an error. Very frustrating. Beyond that, the Independence Pass Brownies were not very chocolatey, the chocolate/white chocolate chip cookies spread just as much as any non-adjusted recipe, and the Buttermilk Chocolate Cake (even after I figured out that the directions should say baking soda insted of baking powder) had a really coarse grain. Therefore, overall it has been disappointing for me."
3,Topper is a great piece of entertainment,"The quality of this DVD is poor. But, I always enjoy Topper. I won't purchase again until it has been updated to a better quality."
5,Satisfied!,"Found this for about 60$ (600 SKR), and must I'm very satisfied. Before I used my aunts old iron without any steam at all, so maybe I don't have that much to compare with. Anyway ironing is now easier, and the result better. The auto-off function is also very good."
3,"Eh, entertaining...but not for the right reason.","The game is somewhat similar to Batman Returns on SEGA CD. The only difference is the jet parts. But the game has fully animated cutscenes that are the same as the Animated Series. They are not repeat of episodes or anything like that, they are unique and made for the game. These scene are entertaining and features all the original voice actors. It worth a look at, but nothing special in the long run though."
5,Hilarious DVD,"This show is very, very funny. My kids love it and watch it over and over, and it's something I don't mind watching with them. The dialogue is witty and clever, and the characters are fun. The plot lines move quickly, and there are all kinds of quotable one-liners. ""It tickles when you bite!"" Especially at this price, this DVD is a must-have."
3,Get the remastered version instead,"If you really want to buy this, get the remastered version instead. It has nicer packaging, better sound quality and 30 minutes of bonus material. To find it, search on History of Grateful Dead (it won't show up if look for Bear's Choice)."
4,Old school,Love Pig-Pen? Love the old-school roadhouse blues influence he brought to the band? This album captures nicely that sound for sure.
2,Disappointing,"This was the first book I read in the series so it may be that I need to try more of them to get used to the characters. I did not like the male protagonist at all, only marginally liked the female protagonist and was disappointed by the mystery itself. The bits of historical accuracy were interesting but nothing new."
3,Murder in Little Italy review,THis is my first book by this author. I found that it ran somewhat slowly and went over the same ground again and again. I was not particularly impressed with the work. I need more quick action as in certain works by the likes of Daniel Silva and James Patterson.
3,Deanna Martin not Dean Martin,I agree with others that this book is more about Deanna Martin than Dean Martin and I could care less about her life and what she did or didn't do. Dean was a really great star and more of his life I would like to know about. Deanna-who cares.
1,Nocturne = sleeping pill,"This book starts slow, stays slow, ends slow. The beginning grabs you, and just as you are preparing for a huge temultuous roller coaster ride, your given the excitement of a ferris wheel. All in all, I have to say just don't do it. Good cover, is the best credit I can give it, and really, the cover doesn't seem to have much to do with the book. In one word, Pathetic."
5,Great Prodict,"Just be careful as to whom you purchase from. DO NOT TRUST a vendor by the name of ""jerry1977"". Buy from ""jerry1977"" and you will not be happy!!!Another vendor Mobilshark is excellent, but his printers are 220v not 110 volt so be sure to ask for the converter. Mobil shark is very easy to deal with."
3,ok,"Much like the first CD, the interpretation is nice, but not at all exciting. Good for elevator music or the opening credits of a 70's sitcom."
2,Needs to be updated. Quickly.,"This review is aimed at those in the upper scoring echelon of the population. If you are getting 200 and wish to improve by a few hundred, this book can help, as most books will.But for those of us who score in the 650+ range who want to shoot for an 800, you need to read this with caution. A lot of the techniques, while timeless in a general way, do need to be modified for the recent exam. This book was published in 1997 and it's getting long in the tooth. Pick up the PR 2003 GRE to know the current state of affairs for strategy. Those who are verbally gifted will also notice more than quite a few errors in this book. Most of the errors will fly under the radar for the general population and so it won't matter, but if you're shooting for 800, you make no mistakes.The vocabularly list is a subset of larger ones in other PR books. Word Smart 2 is a great addition to anyone's library."
2,Acceptable but too superficial for my tastes,"This book gave some reasonable strategies for picking up points on the GRE verbal section. However, I wasn't impressed by anything about the book. It was just sort of there, without real substance and power. A better alternative for the reading comprehension section would be ARCO's GRE-LSAT-GMAT-MCAT reading comprehension workbook. For the other components of the GRE verbal section, something like 1500 More Words You Should Know would give more bang for your buck, since analogy, antonym, and sentence completion sections are strongly vocabulary depende"
3,"Good, but not AWESOME...","I read the other review, and I am beginning to think I may need to re-read this text. Don't get me wrong. I liked the book - but I am not so sure it is the best thing Relevant Publishing has put out.Stylistically, this author writes in a way that felt like each chapter there was a subject and about 5 little rabbit trails he took me on while trying to address the theme.Depth - the text handles some topics that many ""following Jesus"" style books don't even attempt to - and the author does a great job of dealing with the religiosity that confounds many peoples vision of what it means to be a Christian.It didn't take me long to read. It had some good tid-bits. But, nothing earthshattering or new for me."
4,Angry Blues,"While the overall album is very good, 'Angry Blues' has Lowell George on slide guitar in the background, and that elevates it to great! George was an innovator in slide guitar, playing 'down' the neck rather than 'up' as do most others. He was the primary motivator of Little Feat and died WAAAY too early at 34 years in 1979. 'Angry Blues' is a standout track and a great intro to his playing style. I sure miss the guy...SSZ"
5,Other Words that Sell,"Quality book with excellent content. Well presented words for all niches and ad copy. Would highly recommend that if you are not an expert at ad copy and writing articles, you should buy this book."
4,Good Basic Phone,"The phone has a great screen, basic features, and camera works well. We have two and had no trouble with the sim card on either phone (the cingular reps said the problem was with some of the sim cards). The menus are a bit clunky and the navigation buttons cannot be assigned to favorite functions either. The bluetooth seems to be stripped down to only work with headsets.Otherwise:Light-weightThinGood battery life too."
4,wow,"A lot of things happened in this book ,Jeremy and Jess break up, Angel gets broke and Will ruins Jess's life AGAIN which is pretty depressing. But it was interesting to read so Ill give it 4 stars."
1,WTF.,"I was so excited about these and when I finally got it the cards and booklet were all bent up, I ordered a NEW one too. NOT HAPPY."
5,Las Vegas Season 5,"Las Vegas: Season FiveExcellent series, Tom Selleck is excellent and the series is as entertaining as ever. A pity they wont continue to season 6. Recommend this one."
3,... It was .. Okay,"It will teach you just that, the nuts & bolts. It does not go into any advanced topics (at all), and will leave you needing to buy another book to create anything useful."
1,Falsehoods disguised as Christian speaking,"While the comedy on this CD is okay, at best, it's hard to get over the fact that he lies constantly about his life and testimony. While claiming to be repetant about it, he continues to sell this CD on his website, and also has backtracked to claim he only exagerrated. James Frey had his book cancelled and lost his contract with his publisher when he lied about his past story- why do Christian speakers get away with it? Churches must stop sponsoring this man until he comes clean. He does not give God any glory by lying.This CD is full of untruths. Don't pass on lies when the truth will set you free."
3,not the fastest,"I got this card free with the purchase of a camera. Though it's not as fast as some others (SimpleTech, for example), it has not given any errors to date."
4,Holds Plenty,"The prices continue to fall, this 256 card will hold over 256 photos, and the price is great here at Amazon, best Best Buy by a long shot."
4,a memory card,It came comp. with the purchase of a Kodak dig. camera. What can I say: it can hold a bunch of pictures. I rated it a 4 only because I have nothing to compare it to.
3,Okay fo MP3 player but too slow for a D-CAM,"I have this card for over half year with my Minota F100.It works proply but it writes in too slow. It taks about a couple of seconds ( about 5-10 sec) to write a 5 MB image file into the card so I have to wait date write in in order to take next shot.Now I use this card for my Rio Cali MP3 player, it works peoperlybecause it does not requie the cared to write in and read a big file in a fast rate."
5,Another hard rock classic,"I bought this album the only time I've ever seen it on the shelves... and this was at a book store no less! I loved the Montrose debut album and decided to give this one a go without even so much as hearing one song from it before hand. I was not disappointed! ""Paper Money"" includes more layers and complexity than its predecessor, but also has enough truly great hard rock moments to make it another classic. If you liked the debut, check this one out. I know some reviewers felt that this was a significant drop off from their 1st release, but I don't see it. Just listen to ""I've Got the Fire"" and the title cut for a jolt!"
2,Lifeless Effort,"I remember as a young teen hearing about how bad this album was. I figured my tastes have matured and maybe I should give this album a try (now I am dating myself). I puchased this CD on account of the reviews I read on this website. I cannot begin to tell you how disappointed I was once I'd listened to it. I'm a huge fan of the Montrose debut(one of the best metal/hard rock albums ever recorded)& Sammy Hagar. It's amazing how a record company's influence can totally destroy artistic license. I simply refuse to believe that the same members that put together the debut could release such powerless drivel.There is one occasion of inspiration noted on this album, the track entitled 'I Got The Fire', as good as it is it still pales in comparison to the worst track on the debut. This is truly for the hardcore fan of Hager/Montrose."
1,guest,"DO NOT BUY!! I BOUGHT ON SALE FOR 19.99 BUT THATS NOT EVEN WORTH IT. IT WORKS SOMETIMES AND OTHER TIMES YOU JUST GET AN ""E"" SYMBOL??? SOMETIMES YOU WEIGHT 5 LBS HEAVIER THAN YOU DID 2 MINUTES AGO!"
1,Worst book ever by James Patterson,"If you are not totally into golf, you will hate this book. There is really no story to tell only some guy who miraculously learned how to play golf extremely well. I did not think I would ever buy a book by Patterson that was bad but this was one."
5,wonderful,"This was a most enjoyable book. I could not put it down until I finished it. I will read it again, at least once. I'm 83 and sometimes find a re-read fun! :-) :-) :-) Clint."
5,"It's a golf fantasy about an amateur who, down on his luck, decides to try for the PGA Senior Tour.","Heard MIRACLE ON THE 17TH GREEN by James Patterson andPeter de Jonge . . . it's a golf fantasy about an amateur who, downon his luck, decides to try for the PGA Senior Tour.I'm not sure that I buy into the entire plot . . . it's unlikely thata guy would be able to turn around his life and become wildly successfulas a pro golfer within a year . . . yet that criticism aside, I enjoyedthe tale and think you will too--even if you're not a golfer.I did enjoy how the authors threw-in the names of real golfers(e.g., Trevino, Nicklaus, etc.), and it was fun to see how thenewbie interacted with them . . . there's a feel-good endingthat you'll also like."
5,Catnip laughs,"My cats could not wiat for me to get this out of the package, they were all over me once that catnip was unsealed. Played for an hour, slept for a day."
3,A Poignant Character Study,"This is a novel about a man who has devoted his life to only one thing, and who has nothing left when that is taken away from him. The Go Master Shusai is a poignant, but also pathetic (in the negative sense) character. One wonders whether such single-minded dedication, with its concomitant success, is worth the price one pays for it.The novel is somewhat confusing, as it has not been told chronologically. It goes back and forth with the barest warning. This development feels appropriate, however. The novel feels like a memoir.This is not Kawabata's best novel, but it is worth reading if you like Kawabata, if you have the money to buy a good (but not a great) novel, or if you like Go. There are quite a number of printing errors in it, however....If you don't care about Go I don't suppose you would mind these errors. But the book IS about a Go match, and is it too much to ask the editors to do a proper job?"
4,The Master of Go,"I really enjoyed this book, but even though it seems to be intended for go players (the entire book is based on a single game of Go) it often uses the wrong terms, it is also a bit annoying when referring to other games, such as shogi, which it just refers to as chess throughout the entire book, with it only having a note in the back telling you it means shogi whenever it says chess. Overall it is a good read if you play Go, but it does have a few small problems"
3,"Great selection of songs, bad sound quality.","The song ""O'Sullivan's March"" from Rob Roy (track 1 on this cassette) is one of my all time favorite songs. I have never heard a better version than this one. But since it's an audio cvassette, the sound quality is terrible compared to what I am used to. I give it a 3/5. It's okay."
3,It's okay - just okay.,"I bought the large 32 oz bottle for under $3 at a department store, so it was a good bargain overall. But it doesn't provide lasting hydration for my extra dry skin. The transition to cold weather was extra brutal on my arms and legs this year and Queen Helene's Cocoa Butter Lotion did little to combat the dryness and peeling. I'll use it in a pinch when I run out of my preferred moisturizer - but I constantly have to reapply and that's a big no-no for me. Love the smell, love the price - but I wouldn't buy this again."
4,What an imagination!,"This wonderful, though at times difficult book, contains such atmospheric and descriptive writing that the images remain with you for a long time, like flashbacks from a particulary vivid dream. Everytime I see a castle or historic building, crumbling under the wait of time and ivy, I think of this book. It may take you a long time to read Arcady, and its equally compelling and confusing sequel Allamanda, but the visions of the this beautiful and terrifying world, as well as the consistent and sympathetic characterisation, make it well worth the effort.P.S. Buy the UK paperback edition with the wonderful cover by Mick van Houten"
3,i wish for more...,"""Vespertine"" is an album that is just DYING to be remixed...so when i saw that there were 2 remixes on this single... i near died with excitement.Unfortunately... the remixes are both very gentle, and well... not all that great. Imagine taking pagan poetry, introducing a drum machine (and not a good one)... it's very minimal... and just plain ol' average."
4,"Stevie Wonder territory, sanitised for middle America","As the inlay card makes clear, this was a keyboard demonstration record: ""[With two exceptions], all the music heard was produced by keyboard instruments.""The style is largely white man's funk, particularly on the wonderful 'Love is Alive' and 'Much Higher'. Wright's voice is fairly soulful. Musically, Wright is tiptoeing through territory explored much more thoroughly by Stevie Wonder on the earlier 'Music of My Mind', 'Talking Book', 'Innervisions' etc. Lyrically, it's all the soppy stuff about love -- no attempt at Wonder's hard-edged political comment is made.Although this was a No. 1 album for ages in the US in 75, it's a hard-to-get CD in the UK, but I just had to buy it for the glorious intro and hook on 'Love is Alive'."
1,Disappointed,Very Disappointed. I am a daily tea drinker and i was hoping this tea would be special but this tea has no taste.I would rather recommend Tetley which is cheaper and tastes better.
5,Very Good Tea - Wish they had refills for the tin,"This is a fantastic tea. The company always ships very quickly and the orders are accurate. I now have several of these tins though, and I wish they'd offer just the bag refill for the tin."
2,No effect,"After reading all of the positive reviews for this product i thought there might truly be a difference between standard hair vitamins and ones made for ethnic hair. I have been taking these hair vitamins for about a month now and have really seen no difference in my hair growth, honestly i will save my money and just go back to buying the GNC hair and nails formula instead."
1,No improvement,I didn't really see any results with this product. I won't purchase it again and will look for another product.
5,Review on Fast Grow,I have seen a good amount of growth so far which is very noticeable especially because I recently had a hair cut because my hair was uneven and damaged. My hair looks very healthy. I've noticed the thickness come back and I'm going to order another bottle and keep ordering until I achieve my desired hair length. Thanks Fast Grow.
3,Hmmm..,"Well, if you're willing to do some modifications, this costume may fit your bill. And unless you're wanting to look like a pirate street walker, some modifications are necessary. I didn't want my belly hanging out so I used a long black camisole underneath, and I swapped out the flimsy, see-through, cut-up-to-there skirt for a skirt of my own. Also, this costume does run small, so be aware of that."
4,Great book,The picturess in this book are great. This book shows you how to get all textures in the hair just right and it also shows you how to set some scenes. Its great for those who want to draw shoujo manga. (girls manga)
5,Orchestral Excellence,"If there is a star performer on this CD, it has to be the Philharmonia Orchestra of London. Although individual artists are listed - Matthias Feile, Cello; John ANderson, Oboe; and Nicholas Whiting, Violin - the composer, Franz Joseph Haydn, had other ideas regarding solo standouts, making it difficult to strongly identify these individual contributions. But who cares? The orchestra stands out as the star. You know how it always seems there is at least one track you would rather skip and move on to others you enjoy more? There's always at least one, right? Not here; from Adagio: Allegro Con Spirito and Andante Piu Tosto Allegro all the way to the Finale: Presto, it's simply excellent. Haydn's Symphonies 103, 96, and 102 (in that order), never sounded better."
4,Haunting Music,"The Doobies were my favorite group as a teen (I stopped following them after a few Michael MacDonald albums) and this is my favorite album - their songs were so well crafted, with lots of nice touches in the percussion and backing vocals. As the other reviewers noted this album is uniformly good..these songs are just transporting: ""Another Park, Another Sunday"" is as good a song as they wrote."
4,"Nicely done, useful information, weak graphics.","JOSE, CAN YOU SEE?The humor is there, as is the really helpful information and professional tips on how to get the results the pros do. BUT, the publisher should have sprung for how-to photos that can be seen without a microscope! Come on, guys, I'll pay a buck or two more for pictures I can see."
3,not exactly what I wanted,"This book is okay, and I can use it. I really wanted Sourdough Jack's Cookery, which is excellent. I owned a copy of it, but lost it many years ago and have always missed it. I will order it soon.The service was fast and efficient with this item."
5,the complete sourdough cookbook,"I purchased this for a friend, as I have enjoyed this book since 1977, when I purchased it for myself. My friend was so enthralled with my book, that I went in search for one for him, and was very pleased to find it and in excellent condition...he has since dropped me a line to let me know that he has enjoyed many of the recipes out of the book and is thrilled to have it...it arrived in record time and as I said in excellent condition......very delighted with the purchase...w."
3,Great basic recipes,"I have several sour dough recipe books, this is one I use most often. My husband loves the banana nut bread, chocolate cake and pancakes from this book."
2,Not accurate,"We had this scale for a few years. It always has problems in consistent reading. Now, everytime somebody got off the scale, we have to adjust the 0 lb mark. This was actually the second one we got. We had to exchange the first one because the 0 lb mark can't even be ajusted on that one. It also takes up a lot of space in the bathroom if you have a small bathroom."
4,An engaging and touching portrait of WW2,"I found this to be a thoughtful reflection on the resourcefulness of youth, the power of a promise and the daily dangers of war.It was especially interesting that it was told from the perspective of the child. I would watch this again."
2,disappointing,"The book isn't really for beginners. I don't think Java beginners can make sense of the Reflection or servlet code. The XML/XSLT part is hard to follow even after you've already read other books on the subject. The site [url] doesn't seem to exist (I tried on Oct 12 and Oct 13, 2002), so there's no source code available to download. If you're serious about Web Services I recommend you look at Jesse Liberty's books on C# and .Net instead."
5,good,"firstly, want to get it a.s.a.p. have paul simon's africa concert records. shall you post it after 11.june.2001 ?"
3,A nice concert - but not a great one,"I know I'm going against the flow of other reviews on this. I bought this title expecting great live renditions of some of my all time favorite songs by a great master of music and lyrics. But after watching it start to finish, I felt a little let down. He just doesn't seem completely engaged with his music and with the audience. No talk between songs, no interaction with the band members, he just sort of goes through the motions in a good mood but not completely engaged.The sound quality is OK, I liked the DD 5.1 mix better than the dts. I definitely doesn't match up to the sound on some of the better concert DVDs.If you are a die hard Simon fan and enjoy everything he does, then you'll likely enjoy this as well. But for me, it doesn't match up to the likes of similar concert DVDs, like John Fogerty, Fleetwood Mac, Moodly Blues, and the Eagles.Dudeymon"
4,A wonderful moment for all Paul Simon's fans,"This concert features all Paul Simon's hits including songs from the Graceland album and ""old songs"" as The Boxer plus songs from ""You're the One"", Paul's new album. I think that all his fans will enjoy it. The musicians are really good and the whole concert in the Olympia's Theatre is a pure gem."
5,BEST CUP OF TEA,"YORKSHIRE TEA IS STRONG ENOUGH U ONLY NEED TO USE ONE TEABAG, UNLIKE OTHER TEAS. I LOVE THE FLAVOUR, REMINDS ME OF BEST OF ENGLAND. I ENJOY AN EARLY MORNING CUP, DAILY, STRONG WITH ADDED MILK. TENDS TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH IT & IS GOOD PRICE @ AMAZON."
4,really pleasant and relaxing,"i really enjoy this instructor. she is not only pretty, but is very pleasant and easy to pay attention to. she's not annoying or anything. i also really like the actually workouts, i can feel them working and the band makes them that much better. i would recommend this to anyone."
5,Challenging but fun!,"I've had this dvd for awhile but recently started actually using it...lol...each workout is only 10 minutes long, but you feel the burn! I am ALWAYS sore after doing the workouts, especially the one for the upper body. My triceps are crazy sore right now! :) I really recommend this dvd; it's challenging but enjoyable and effective. The instructor is not annoyingly perky but quite pleasant and easy to listen to and follow."
1,Vet bills through the roof from this product,"My pet sitter gifted my dog with one of these for the holidays. I tried to find reviews of them due to my dog's previous problems with chicken jerky, etc. but I found no reviews. I gave it to my dog and within one day he developed a severe rash on his belly and under his legs. His ears became infected, as did his eyes. His front paws swelled to twice their size. BEWARE, there is something chemical in these things that can trash your dog and your checkbook at the vet. DO NOT BUY THESE!"
5,"huge range of experiences and feelings, huge value of these tales","This collection is a classic. First-parents, adopted people, adoptive-parents, and others will connect to these accounts by persons affected by adoption. I know many people have responded to my own ""Reunion, or the Hole in Time"" account of my and my first son's reunion, but my own far-and-away-favorite piece in the volume is ""Beast Carolina,"" Laurel K. Jenkins-Crowe's sensitive and sometimes hysterically funny, right-on account of growing up adopted with a child's wondrous imagination. Evocative and often elegant poems by Penny Callan Partridge, Allyssa Lappen, CB Follett, Ellen Bass, Dina Ben-Lev, Lauren Schiffman, Joan I. Siegel, and others are among other stand-out works here---but in fact it's impossible to pick out ""bests"" from this collection, with so many utterly honest yet finely honed pieces. I'd recommend this to anyone affected by, or contemplating, adoption, or who wants to know more."
4,deeply existentially disturbing,"If you are remotely interested in true, psychological, atmospheric horror, you must read Liggotti. Period. He didn't write that much, so you might as well read it all. It's not that any particular ""story"" is particularly riveting (in fact, his most famous one, Feast of the Harlequin, is my least favorite one), it's the mood and tenor of the whole experience. It's like asking ""which song on Dark Side of the Moon do u like best?"" That question/approach misses the point. With so much garbage being mass-produced in every medium and at every level, it is reassuring to find someone with actual talent, originality, and clarity of vision, although in the Ecclesiastes sense."
2,Money Back Please,"I am greatly disappointed in this video. First, I think a professional of David's caliber should not sale this as something that you can do in the comfort of your home, unless of course, you have carpet a mile deep to absorb the shock. He does the routine on sand and with just cause. The constant jarring that you place on your joints by doing this tape could have long-term negative effects.I feel that because of the techniques required to do these movements properly are important, that the sandy surfaces are not the best for instructional purposes.I believe some of the customer's comments, that you will see positive outcomes by doing this tape. You can't help but to lose inches and tone up . . . but at what cost?"
5,WOW!!!,"What a pleasant surprise! I purchased this DVD on the advice of the previous reviews still remaining wary of the quality of this DVD. Boy, was I proven wrong! David Kirsch has a kind of sweet enthusiasm that's absolutely contagious when working out. Although this workout stands up to it name, ""Ultimate"", I didn't find myself discouraged if I couldn't finish the amount of reps they performed on the screen. If anything, David Kirsch's performance encourages me to keep going, and stick with this program until the end. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who's finally tired of the same old thing and needs a little guidance with an extra TLC, or as he calls it ""Sound Mind, Sound Body""."
4,Ridiculous Reviews!,"After listening to this album only once, I have found that is a wonderful compilation of patriotic country music. While it is missing a few songs that I would have included, it is full of emotion and patriotism.I can hardly believe some of the reviews for this CD. My brother is in the Army, and has been to Iraq. Some of the things said are riduculous and hurtful to read. I think that this CD is a great way for country fans to support their country and the troops that are overseas.If you have a problem with this CD, or this type of music, simply do not listen to it!Thanks to everyone out there that is supporting out troops overseas!"
4,Nice for the Price,"While I'm still acclimating to a Pull Style mat cutter, I must say that my first impressions are favorable. I especially like the start/stop mark for the blade. This feature along has improved my, admittedly, novice ability to get the cut right on the first try.My biggest complaint is the chrome (metallic) press bar. I wish it were covered in an easy grip rubber and was just a bit larger. I find it difficult to grip with my large hands."
4,"Personally, I love it","Why ""personally""? Because my dog hates it.I don't mind, though, because I've been using this product for years on him to freshen him up a bit between washes, and it really works.You just spray, work it a bit into the fur, and towel the pet off. It's just that simple, and the results really are noticeable. My dog smells better, is cleaner and therefore happier to go about his day. Plus, he just loves the toweling off part, so he doesn't say much during the process.The scent isn't fruity or anything, I really can't even describe this scent. Nothing extremely pleasant, so if you're looking for something like that, this isn't your product.If you're looking for something simple that would definitely work, I'd recommend this. Not saying others don't work, but I did try some dry shampoos for dogs here and there and this one was really the only one that was actually like bathing him without the water, in terms of cleaning."
4,a good machine for the home,"This is a great food slicer for the home kitchen, (dont compare apples with oranges, this isnt a commercial slicer, but it wasnt advertised as one either) it works great for anything from bacon to tomatos. It has a powerfull motor and a very sharp blade with infinite thinkness adjustments up to a 1/2"", easy to clean and very well built. If you want a good slicer for home use you'll be happy with a waring food slicer."
1,Drivel,"Written by a angry woman who can't get a man, or maybe choosed the wrong man. Not helpful so mcuh as sad an angry."
4,Easy reading,This is a great book about nature. All the chapters a 1-2 pages whichis so nice. He talks about so many nature things we take for granted. Makes you want to spend all time outside. All his books are so wonderful.
3,OK phones,"The phones work ok, but the wireless range seems to be less than the 5.8 ghz phones they replaced."
1,A Rip-Off,"They don't tell you this but only one of the phones actually dials out. What this manufacturer was thinking when they made this package is completely unknown. Ostensibly, there is one phone for actually using and the other is one that is paged. You cannot add on or modify the system. The static is nearly always present, you need to change the channels often. Don't waste your money on this system."
3,"Good , but not as helpful as it could be","I am not interested in sending this book back to Amazon as I do enjoy having Yoga positions at my finger tips. It's a good book for people who have never done yoga or would like to try yoga stretches for warm ups - cool downs during exercise. But I didn't find it helpful for what I thought its purpose was - how to combine yoga and walking. I thought possibly there would be more about how to hold yourself while walking, breathing while walking, positions to do with your arms and legs while you are walking. Possibly I should read this again.... hmmm"
1,Disappointed with lack of depth,"I was excited to read this book, because as the mother of a boy, I wanted to find out how my husband and I can make sure church is relevant to our son. Unfortunately, I was offended at much of the content because of the author's problem with women in authority. Rather than focus on concrete suggestions of how to draw boys into church, the author spent a lot of time discussing God's role for women in the church and how the Bible does not support women in leadership. I did not feel that the author was qualified to address that issue. He has much experience in youth ministry working with boys, but I didn't come away with a better understanding of how my church can change to meet the needs of boys."
5,Finally!,"It takes guts to write a book like this. It is even gustier to read and apply a book like this. Rick Bundschuh has guts. He also has creativity, insight, and a refreshing writing style that makes this book a ""must read"" for families, youth ministers, pastors - anyone involved in turning boys into men. As a long-time youth minister, I have learned the importance of reaching, and sometimes reclaiming, the ""young lions"" of the teenage community. It's great to read a book that puts these vital issues into perspective!"
1,There are many golf books better than this one!,"Please don't waste your money on this book, while the premise is good, the writer appears to have no real access to the players and/or is very afraid of pissing them off. He doesn't tell anything pithy about any player or tournament and if you know anything about golf you will come away very disappointed. Additionally, the author's writing is lackluster and he appears to rely on second hand information and the anecdotes of others. The best lines of this book are on the back of the jacket cover and after that well... there are just a lot of better golf books!By the way the 5-Star review (in this section) ""Strenge Aces the PGA Tour"" is either written by his publisher or his friend. There is not a sign of ""meticulous research"" in this book and it is not even remotely in the same league as The Majors."
3,"Light read, lacks depth","This is a very quick read. The author incorporates anecdote after anecdote, none lasting more than a couple of paragraphs. As others have noted there are better golf books out there, but this one is a very quick read, and you may come across a few stories that you haven't heard before. Recommended more for the golf novice (like myself) than the hardcore fan."
4,The best of Maria Callas on DVD from EMI,"To honour the 30th Anniversary of the death of Maria Callas, EMI Classics has put together a compilation of the best moments from its collection of DVD featuring the diva. Thus,there are moments from the television concerts Callas recorded in Hamburg, London and Paris, the interviews she recorded in her home in 1968, and for Paris TV in 1965 & 1969, plus scenes from the 1987 documentary ""Life And Art.""Of primary interest is the 1957 RAI TV performance of ""Casta Diva"" not released by EMI Classics previously and thought lost for 40 years until it was aired on Italian TV in 1997 as part of the 20th anniversary memorial tribute to Callas.This is a good compilation of clips from these disparate sources and will serve as a good introduction to the diva for new fans. Long term fans who have all the previous EMI Classics DVD of Callas will only be interested in the 1957 ""Casta Diva."" However, it is a well presented collection and worth a look."
1,Hmmm ...,"Although I have been an avid Barbara Cartland fan for years, I was quite disappointed with this particular novel. I was so excited to have been able to find it on Amazon and add it to my now-increasing collection which dates back to the late 1970's ... Yet, It was just so prdictable! And in many ways ... ""insulting"" from a female point of view!!!I quite disliked the fact that in order to have the heroine learn a valuable lesson of love and compassion; she had to be cast as a concubine amidst a barbaric male-dominated era! I'm from the Middle East myself .. and though women were nothing more than servents back in the day ... I couldn't help but feel disappointed that Dame Cartland chose to concentrate on that particular point rather than reflect more on the educated minority of women who were actually quite powerful and influencial in many ways.But that's just my opinion!"
2,batteries,The batteries came in single packs which is OK. However they had a 2006 date on them so they probably will not last very long. Same store batteries have date like 2017 on them.Not real happy.Pay more and get fresh new batteries that have good shelf life.
5,A story of Jennifer's loss of her husband and my best friend,I began reading this book not knowing what to expect. I knew Jim for over 30 years before we was taken in the tragedy of 9/11. I only met Jennifer at their wedding 5 years before that. Having known Jim for so long I knew that his bride was a strong willed person. This book is a look into the pain and suffering that many like Jen must be suffering. It also provides a guide that can be followed to find a way out of the darkness and how to rediscover hope and faith. An excellent read!
3,Not the best Beginners Book,"Jon Platinia's book on Jung is a fair introduction. The presentation and organization of the book overall is somewhat confusing while the writing is dry and unexciting. I found myself skimming over some lines either because the writing was uninteresting, or the subject at hand. The life of Jung was interesting, but once it moved into the psychological works, it lost some of its steam. There are better Jung intro's available than this one."
2,"confusing, unsatisfying",I bought this book hoping to get a basic understanding of Jung's ideas and of why he is considered so important. I was disappointed because the book was confusing and didn't leave me feeling like I knew much more about Jung's ideas than before I had read the book.
1,Poor,"I've heard of Jung, but only vaguely knew what he was about, and wanted to know more. However, this is not a book for beginners. There is too much unexplained psychobabble and gobbledegook. The jokey, flippant cartoons and asides get in the way of any attempt at explaining his theories. Only the glossary is useful. Overall I wouldn't recommend this book."
5,A Must Have For Any Sabbath Enthusiast,"This was part of my collection WAAAY back in my teenage years. We Sold Our Souls (a collection of) held all the very essence of Sabbath, while this and Vol. 4 were notable albums that went deeper in the scope of ability and power of THE major influence of every single metal and power band out there. Sabatoge takes you on a echo influxed journey through the ""mind"" and ""dark dementia"" of Sabbath. You can NOT say you are a fan of sabbath and NOT have this cd!"
5,Awesome!,"This album marks the high water mark of what Sabbath were to achieve. The opening 3 tracks will blow you away, ""Megalomania""and ""The Writ"" are masterpieces, ""Supertzar"" is bizarre. Probably the weakest track is ""Am I going Insane"", but that's just because it's too much synth for me. This should definitely be marked an ""essential recording"". Get it!"
2,Far from their prime,"On ""Sabotage"", Black Sabbath seem to be very uninspired, and the material is at best average or mediocre. The opener ""Hole in the sky"" together with ""Symptom of the universe"" and ""Thrill of it all"" are alright in comparison the other not-exciting songs. The production suffer from the muddy unclear sound that is recognizable on many of the bands album. This is mainly for dedicated Sabbath fans, others will find much more pleasure in a ""best of"" album."
2,beginig of the end for black sabbath,i cant believe the rest of the reviews for this album. dont believe what they say . this album SUCKS!! every album that preceeded this was far better. on this album they are trying to seiously expand their sound but it just doesnt work!! DONT BUY IT IM WARNING YOU!!!!!!
5,This album is unique,"""Hole inthe Sky"" absolutely, utterly,completely,RROCCKKSS! The rest of the album isn't bad either! Worth buying just for the opener.Also,is it just me ,or are Led Zeppelin not very good?"
4,Sabotage,"I got this album after Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and while this album was their masterpiece, Sabotage is still pretty good. It's standout tracks are Hole in the Sky and Symptom of the Universe. The last four tracks on the cd don't sound like Sabbath, but this album is the last good one they made with Ozzy."
5,Amazing Little Program,"Using this program, you upload an audio file to the DJ ToneXpress website and download the ringtone. Ringtones must be compatible with the make and model of your phone. You may download a sample ringtone from DJ ToneXpress to ensure that the ringtone is compatible. After you purchase the software, you choose your phone from a list of at least 1,000 phones.Creating a new ringtone is easy. You just open the DJT program, choose a sound file from your hard drive, trim it to the section you want, and upload it to the DJT website. You may then either send it to your phone from DJT or download it to your computer. Once on your computer, you may transfer it to your phone by bluetooth or USB cable. If you want to convert a song from an audio CD, you will need a CD ripper. My entire CD collection is now available for free ringtones. Amazing."
1,Ringtone Creator,"It is supposed to allow you to create ringtones for free, but they actually cost more than if you just have the phone company do it."
3,"Good, but not great","After trying a couple other ringtone software programs, I will admit that DJ ToneXpress is far superior because it actually works. It is very easy to use and I am able to send the ringtones directly to my phone or friends' phones quickly. My only complaint is that when the software converts the song file into a ringtone, it ruins the sound quality of music clip. When creating the ringtone on the software, it sounds great, but once you download it, it sounds like the song was recorded with a microphone over a speaker phone. And, if the ringtone is too loud, it creates a static noise. Overall, I'm still happy with the product, but the ringtones definitely do not sound like the original music files."
3,game is desent,"ive been playing eqoa since feb of 03 ive quit a few times but always came back. the game does have out of date graphix. but what keeps drawing me back to the game is theres always one mob i didnt get to kill, or a quest i never finshed or got to do. there so many friends you will meet so many people on this game not as many back in the begining but still alot of people you will meet along the way."
4,great game,"If you like dragons and monsters you would like this game.This game is however not as advanced as WoW, it is for the ps2 and they are limited, that is why I gave it a rate of 4 stars. I have played it for 4 years strait, and bought it for a friend it is also cheaper yearly than WoW. I would recamend it to anyone, but it is like I said not as advanced as the computer online games, so dont get your hopes up. But I still think it is an awsome game I play it still and this is year 5 for me now. It is addictive so if you dont wanna be a couch potato its not the game for you."
1,Less interesting than staring at dirt.,"This is mind-numbingly dull. If you are not slap-yo-mamma passionate about dry, hardcore academic biblical studies, do NOT take whatever class has this book on its syllabus. You will rue the day you did."
4,For those on the journey to carrying out their Call.,Excellent. Thought provoking. I recommend this book to those who are on that rollercoaster ride to carrying out their Spiritual purpose. Several chapters are particularly detailed for our single sisters. This book magnifies those things/people we allow to hinder our journey and re-direct our paths. It stresses the importance of staying focused. Read it and pass it on to someone else. I have.
3,Wait just a little bit longer...,"I'll admit it I am a little biased towards NVidia and have always used their cards. The 8800GTS and GTX are both amazing cards, even the 320MB version blows everything else out of the water! However AMD/ATI is going to be releasing the R600 very soon - The official spec's on the card are a 512-bit bus and GDDR4, and a lower version with GDDR3. You can expect that the numbers will be a bit higher in the benchmarks therefore there will be a battle once again between the two. I would assume NVidia has something up their sleave to combat this card... maybe an 8900GTX?? 8950?? Anyways, prices on these products will drop dramatically so I'd hold off just a little bit longer if you can before buying these cards..."
2,nothing much happens...,"this is a film about a day in the life of a mildly egocentric, narcissistic, over sexed yuppie who is vaguely unhappy with his job. there, i just summed up the entire film for you... i give this 2 stars because it is fairly impressive that the guy made the entire film for less than $300, but overall it felt like a waste of an hour and a half..."
4,A good rpg,"If your a big fan of cut and slash then this is the game for you, the game includes a good character building system and is very ally/enemy interactive. At the start of the game you are allowed to choose from five different characters of the usual scource(barbarian, necromancer, rogue, scorcerer, cleric. Whats also great about this game is you can also go online if you have the connection and you dont have to share screens with other players. The graphics are more advanced than previous cut& slash such as baldurs gate, shows some awesome spell effects, main downside to the game is i think they could have made it a little longer, i guess it made up for that with the three different vehicle levels which you can start from the beginning in with the same characters. I think you will enjoy it........worth buying."
3,Good installation reference but a bit outdated,"This huge tome is best referred to if installing onto a machine which is about the same age ie. 486 era. As this book is basically just a hardcopy of the Sunsite how-tos its useful life was always destined to be short, and the number of sections that are still completely relevant is quite disproportionate to the size of the book. That there are so many new software packages available now that the bible doesn't cover isn't a criticism, just a comment on the rate of progress in the development of Linux. That said, it is still the first book I pick up when setting up a system - even if only to refresh my memory on the workings of Lilo or fdisk! For a new user with new hardware, however, buy an install guide (like the one by Matt Welsh that is the most useful part of the bible) for the basics and look elsewhere for up-to-date information."
1,charo and guitar,"I just received this CD yesterday and was VERY anxious to play it as I first heard this CD on Amazon.Well, it honestly sound TERRIBLE. The 'treble' was overbearing and the 'bass' just about Zero!!!!I would not recommend ANYONE buy this CD - especially at current CD prices...."
2,Broke almost immedately,"The sound stopped almost immediately after the first use. It was cute while it lasted, but not worth the money!"
4,Spoiled brat LOVES it!,"At first glance out of the box, I was sorely disappointed about how small this thing was! Seriously, about the size of my palm! However, this toy seems very well made and what it ""says"" my dog loves! It's easy to squeeze for her, and it barks and pants!The most important thing is she loves it and plays fetch with it often, making it ""talk"" constantly as she brings it back!For the retail price, I most definitely would not buy it for her as she tends to make cotton balls out of her stuffie in minutes...but for the price I paid, well worth it!Would definitely recommend!ETA: Added 8/29/2010 I take back my previous statement of paying for this toy at full price! More than two years later.. and another new puppy, this toy is still going strong and still getting tons of usage!! Batteries have lasted this entire time too! Impressed!!"
1,Horrible! Waste of money as a dog toy!!!,"The only thing I can say nice about this toy is that it is cute! Might make a cute (although expensive) toy for a child but is a HORRIBLE dog toy. My 7 month old, 20 pound puppy had the nose off in less than 24 hours and we had to take it away from her since stuffing is coming out!!! I wish I spent the money on another Kong toy and I am so disappointed in this purchase that I am writing my first review although I have been shopping on Amazon for years!"
4,"Material, great. Writing, difficult","I read about this author for several years before I got the book.I've read books on the same topic, but this gives further support for accepted principles. Mr. Swensen gives more insight into the benefits of investing diversification into low cost index mutual funds. He is particularly good at detailing visble and hidden costs that detract from performance while giving practical advice on implementation.Writers that have mastered their subject, write clearly. I don't understand why the cumbersome writing. Personal style, poor editing, or obscure ethical/legal protection?"
4,"This book gives excellent advice, but is a bit long winded.","I got this book based on an interview with the author David Swensen in Barron's Magazine. While first thumbing through the book, it seemed like a waste of money because the first few chapters give info that most investors already know, such as the importance of asset allocation, diversification, and the futility of market timing. A little more time spent with the book gave me advice that I think will help increase my investment returns with less worry and portfolio management headaches. The best part of the book for me was Chapter 11 on exchange traded funds (ETFs) which the author explains can be used to create a well diversified, low cost investment portfolio. He names the specific ETFs in that chapter. I give the book 4 stars instead of 5 because the author is long winded and repeats himself, an example is table I.1 and table 3.1 in the book are identical (although the info in the table is one of the key points he has in the book)."
2,Its clear Mr. Swensen has never held the hand of an Individual Investor,I loved David Swensen's white paper about institutional portfolio construction; I liked his book onPioneering Portfolio Management: An Unconventional Approach to Institutional Investment- with this book he stepped outside his area of expertise.
1,R-Type III,Too much going on in this game for such a small screen. Some games just need to be kept for the tv screen and played with a real controller. save your money
2,"comfortable, but goes flat.","I got this pillow when I was about 20 weeks pregnant based on all the good reviews I had read. First of all, it is a huge pillow. If you're looking for something compact, this is not the right body pillow for you. It was very comfortable at first. I used it for a few months with no problems. However, I'm now 35 weeks pregnant and it's become pretty much useless. It's very flat and gives no support anymore. I wish there was a way to re-fluff it or something. I feel bad for spending so much money on something that didn't last beyond a few months."
1,very disappointing,This pillow was very flimsy. It felt like it was only stuffed to 50% of it's capacity which caused the stuffing to bunch up in certain places. Big let down. The pics looked so promising.
4,Wonderful read,"A well-written, page-turning adventure that is enjoyable and enlightening to read. Fascinating even. I recommend it."
5,Great Product.,This trigger was easy to attach and orperates with ease. The ability to move around the object I am photographing without wires to trip me is great. Maybe one in one-hundred triggers mis-fire and that is acceptable to me.
3,A distant 2nd,A pretty good book but didnt live up to When heaven and Earth changed places. She makes herself sound like to much of a victim when the men in her life saved it and took pretty good care of her.
5,Why the hell is this out of print?,"It's a crime that this title should remain out of print in the U.S., and still very difficult to find elsewhere (my order for it has been put on backorder three times).Not only is this a landmark in jazz, but a landmark in the way it reflects the civil rights movement of the 60's. The music is intense and stirring, certainly the most powerful music Max Roach has ever recorded (even more so than his great, masterful work with Clifford Brown). Recorded with Abbey Lincoln, at the time married to Roach, and tenor saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, this used to be a popular album among jazz enthusiasts, but for some reason it's been given some pretty shabby treatment, having been allowed to drift into relative obscurity. If you can get a copy for a decent price, pick it up."
2,Small for price,The net is ok but the telescoping wand is very short and the net capture area small for the money
3,Mini Pond Net,"Nice product overall, just a little smaller than I expected it to be! But will still find use for it in the baby tank! Still would recommend, just for smaller fish."
5,Zacherley IS the Coolest Ghoul,"A few years ago I started the switch from records to CDs. I had some great stuff like every Elvis LP ever released. Others included Chuck, Fats, Gene, Jerry Lee, and Little Richard. In total over 700 of the best 50s and 60s had to offer. I got rid of them all except for Spook Along with Zacherley. I just couldn't part with it. Sure the songs are simple and silly but they are also great fun. If you like the classic horror films from the 30s and 40s you'll like Zack."
1,Another Alpha Dud,"Though it is not illegal for Alpha to keep putting out unwatchable prints of films such as this one, it is certainly immoral."
5,"A ""must-read"" on the behavior & psychology of serial killers","This book is a valuable resource for mystery authors or anyone else who is interested in the subject of serial murder.Written by three experts in the field, the book covers the behaviors that occur before, during and after the murder, as well as insight into the techniques used to profile and capture serial killers.Crime scene analysis, forensic pathology, and interviewing techniques are also discussed."
4,Well thought out.,Sexual Homicide: Paterns and Motives is an excellent source for any investigator or person in need of information on processes of the killers mind. The book looks at the psychology of the offenders as well as the physical aspects identifying different types of offenders.If you use or like this bookCrime Classification Manual: A Standard System for Investigating and Classifying Violent Crimesis a must have as well.James A. Forrest -Eye of the Storm
2,why?,"This 'flautist angel' is crude, eschewing classical representation to debase itself in the distortions of folk art. A freak frisson of masochism prompted me to order an item that believes human anatomy is modelled upon slurry running from a faucet. Look at it. It's not playing the flute, it's smelling the flute. It just sits there and smells that tubey flute all day with a gormless countenance. I turned it around so I can no longer see its face, but then those wings - I mean polyps - on its back wag at me, threatening to roll around like grubs."
2,Gets very dirty and cant clean,"We bought this last winter for the birds and they never really took to it like our other birdbaths. Some did use it but i would not recommend this birdbath. it gets dark and dirty under the water line and really no way to clean it, you cant scrub it or you loose the little sandcovering. we will keep looking for someway to give our feathered friends some water in the winter"
5,heated birdbath,"I received a gift card to Amazon for Christmas, and thought I'd see if they carried any heated birdbaths. Imagine my surprise when I found the same one that I had chosen from a catalog for backyard bird supplies, and for ten dollars less, and free shipping!I am thus far completely satisfied with this birdbath, and love the fact that the heating element is thermostatically controlled. My only tip is, due to evaporation it needs water level checked daily."
4,Farm Innovators FS-1 Four Seasons Sand Coated Heated Birdbath - Tan...,"Works as described. We've had low temps where our other birdbath was frozen. This one stayed unfrozen, even down to the mid teens. Birdies love it !!"
3,Tommy Dorsey- Greatest Hits,"Tommy Dorsey- Greatest Hits: Delivers what it says: hits from all of Dorsey's career. Expensive for the number of pieces included and not nearly as good as the Sinatra-Dorsey CD which was 5-star. My judgement is, of course, subjective, because I remember Dorsey from the '40s when his arrangements seemed much smoother than the earlier ones included on this CD."
1,Exercise Yoga Ball Smelled Strongly of Plastic,"The yoga ball took some time to inflate (appox. 30 mins.) and once inflated it worked just fine, however, the malodorious odor from the plastic was overwhelming to me. I returned the ball for a full refund and the manufacturer, The HPMS, Inc. The Therapy Connection, immediately assured me that I would receive a refund."
2,exercise ball,They did replace the first ball due to defect. The pump that comes with this ball is a cheap piece of crap. It takes days of filling it up to stay firm. I am not happy!
3,Under impressed by teach yourself norwegian..,I bought teach yourself norwegian before taking a trip to Norway this last christmas. I also bought the teach yourself norwegian conversation CD package as well. It was not really what I expected but it has not been a bad book either. I would not recommend someone buying it brand new maybe used and if it were not too expensive it is a good source of help but I feel as though a true class would be 100% better than this book. I think if you have a lot of time to dedicate to this book it is okay. All of the narration is in a british accent and some of the slang is english as well. As someone with a norwegian significant other I have learned more from him than what this book has done for me.
4,Rockin'!,"After hearing the title track of this short album on Sons of Guns (released by Classic Rock Magazine), a compilation of Guns N' Roses inspired sleaze rock tracks from new artists...well, suffice it to say that I wanted to hear more from The Erotics, and soon!""Soon"" didn't come soon enough, and it was over a year before I finally got to hear this album in its entirety, but it was worth the wait.A strong but fairly short collection of sleazy rock n' roll, Rock N Roll Killing Machine is far from one dimensional. The title track, as I've mentioned, is just some great rock n' roll, which is matched by the energetic ""I Wanna Be Somebody"" and the darker ""Only a Fool,"" which has a definite oldies vibe running through it.At only seven songs long, this still stands as a strong album, full of fun, high impact rock n' roll. Good stuff!"
5,The Commander at his best,If you want to add one Commander Cody item to your music collection this is it. This is the height of his band The Lost Planet Airmen. Andy Stein on the fiddle is a classical violinist and is amazing. A very fun very live romp through alot of their best music.
4,Handy Tool,Great for barbecue. Temp probes with cords not designed for heat of barbecue. Very easy to use.
5,Hilarious! A Must-Read for Everyone!,"This was absoultely one of the funniest books I think I have ever read! I am a political science major in college, and I think this should be required reading. My favorite part is when Rosemary first meets G.B. I first heard about this book in George Magazine. I think everyone should read it."
3,Funny Book,"I enjoyed the book and nearly fell out of bed laughing many times. Lydia Millet has a dry sense of humor. Her main character is along the lines of what most would have labeled as ""trailer trash."" If you like irony and twisted, irrational main characters, you'll likely enjoy this short novel."
5,great 2 in 1 cd,"Another great 2in1 cd, with this you get Doris's first solo lp with great versions of bewitched, bothered and bewildered, you go to my head and that old feeling. The second album is a studio version of the songs from that great film Young At Heart, so not only do you get Doris but you get the great Frank Sinatra (however the tracks that are Sinatras are earlier versions as he had an exclusive contract with Capitol) but this is still a great buy and well worth it if you like doris or frank."
1,Not appropriate for young children,"I am very enthusiastic about exposing my children to different cultures and ideas, and when I saw this book and read the reviews on Amazon, I was excited to get it for my girls. When the book arrived, I read it immediately. The story and the pictures are beautiful. I liked everything until the very last sentence of the book -- I was very surprised to read that Yeh-Shen's stepmother and stepsister were ""crushed to death in a shower of flying stones."" Although I understand that this may be part of the original story, I am giving this book one star because it is supposed to be appropriate for children 4-8. I don't believe, with such a violent and disturbing ending, that it is appropriate for this age group."
4,mukticulturalism,"This book is excellent for early elementary students. The language is simple and clear. The stories are extremely interesting and will enlighten the reader to other cultures. The accompanying pictures contain endearing little characters that children will adore. This alphabetically arranged collection will introduce young readers to a new set of tales, unlike they 've ever heard before. I loved it!"
4,"Very simple, effective and motivational","I purchased this hoping to gain some insight into how to do it right. I wanted to be effective at what training I do, build mass, and be safe. This book has helped me with all the above, with the exception of building mass which I feel is not its place anyways (that goes into diet, supplements ,etc). The plastic cover makes it more of a go-anywhere book, able to handle the stress of being in and out of a gym bag and getting flopped on the floor at the base of different exercise equipment. I highly recommend this for the beginner to intermediate who wants results in an easy to read down to earth manual."
2,Better off with a $9 wheel,Too expensive and the handles are skinny. If you have no plans of using the feet then save your money and go buy a cheaper one.
3,"Good, but not as good as the other barbie movies","This was a good kids movie. My daughter loves it, but I don't think it was as good as the other Barbie movies. The plot was a bit weak and the story line was old. But, I guess the dancing in it overrides it as the kids like it."
1,Not if you want to sleep at night....,"I purchased this movie for my little 6 year old and she had nightmares for a long time after. The premise of this movie is that the princesses have to escape the cruelty of their soon to be step mother and go to a magical land where they are free to dance all night. This movie is especially disheartening and scary to children who have a sick parent as the father is in this movie. The evil mother attempts to poison the father so she can gain control of the kingdom. This does not sound like something a 5-9 year old should be watching. I have since tapped into the Holly Hobbie dvd's and my 8 year old loves them and I love the solid family values and great role model that Holly is. The ""Holly Hobbie and Friends: Christmas Wishes"" is a must have for every little girl. Hope this helps - good luck!"
4,Aspiring 4 year old ballerina loves this!,"My almost 4-year-old daughter is in love with Barbie, dancing, ballerinas, ect....and this movie was right up her alley and made the perfect Christmas gift. With plenty of dancing thrown in this movie is very true-to-form of all the other Barbie movies: innocent young girl(s) facing a complication in their life from some 'bad' person who threatens to interrupt their fun-loving lifestyles...nothing ever truly harmful or bad or scary, more comical and cheesy than anything else."
5,Barbie forever!,Our whole family is glued to the screen when we watch Barbie movies. They are well written and the story lines are nice and clean. Even my husband will watch these.
3,The sequence music is grating to my nerves...,"The movie is good. The kids enjoy it. It holds their attention. The quality...eh....seems like low budget computer images. A little creepy the way they talk and move. But the worst part is the music they play throughout - the scene opening music, just a few bars, it's very creepy music actually - eery. It's like a synthesizer keyboard and it just stands out to me. It grates on my nerves when I am listening to the movie and catches my attention even when I'm doing something else in the background."
4,"Built well, does the job","Needed a switch to toggle a phone line between phone and fax machine. Did the job. Switch, knob, box, connections on back are made well."
2,Bad Collection,"As my expectations were much higher for a widely distributed DVD of numerous bellydance performances by varying artists, this will be an unkind review. So here goes: Bellydancing is basically a series of fluid, serpentine movements enacted through the rhythm of music. Serpentine-snake or snakelike. Now, how many fat snakes have you ever seen? I know, it's mean; but I bought this with the impression that there would have to be at least one good dance. Not for me. Actually, I envisioned two good dances, as two future Bellydance Superstars are on this DVD: Sabrina Fox and Elizabeth Strong. Not to discredit them, as their performances on BDSS are great, but they should've been allowed to perform solo, rather than with one or more other dancers. Maybe that was their downfall here. The company that released the DVD isn't necessarily bad; Tribal Revolution had several good dances-notably Zoe Jakes and Ariellah. I recommend that one instead."
1,Inaccurate by 54 degrees,"I received one of these for my birthday and really liked the concept of monitoring the meat temperature away from the grill while mingling with guests. Well, it turned out the beef we served was way too raw. I boiled some water and the probe recorded 156 degrees when an old analog instant thermometer registered 210. It is now in the garbage can. This is not the first Polder product we have purchased but it will be the last. A Polder temperature fork was also way off. If it was from a local store I would take it back."
1,not recivied order???????,i order awireless thermometer last December2002 and have not recived my order. so i wouldn't recomand to purche any thing that they SELL???????
2,NOT FOR MACS,If you own a MAC do not get this camera. There are a lot of UVC Compliant WebCams. These WebCams will work on the USB network without a driver. This is not one of them.
4,Great camera with a great price!,"This is a great camera for the price. Now don't buy this camera if you are looking for high-definition video from it. I have this camera just to be able to talk to family and friends out of state and out of the country. It is reliable and provides the video I need to be able to see and talk with the people in my life. You can't beat an under $20 camera with this quality. Don't forget about the reputation that Logitech has. I've been using their products for years and love every single one! This camera comes with software that has some great features like low-light adjustment, brightness, contrast, and color. If you need a great camera and a great price, Logitech Quick Cam Chat!"
2,Not up to par,"This one is just not up to par. I have a Logitech camera with built-in mic that is in the $50 range, and got this for my office. The room-light picture is far less competent, and the camera ghosted pretty badly. I've traded it in for one with a better picture, and am much happier.I recommend, as temptimg as it is to save money, if you want to use a camera inside, for Sype-ing or something similar, that you got for a camera a bit more competent than this, even though it means spending a few more dollars."
3,"Works well, I wish it had a microphone","This product works well, I wish it had a microphone. Kind of hard to set level on top of your monitor. Focus is adjustable."
2,I'm returning it.,The video quality is nowhere near what I expected and I am disapointed enough to return it.Its got a good swivel and thats about it; the content that comes with it is so-so and the headset is pretty minimal.
4,Sounds So Real!,I got this toy for our guys because they keep watching the little white kitty outside. I figured I was probably saving her life by getting them their own. Sounds very realistic.
1,talking dog toy,"If your pet has EVER torn open any toy, do NOT buy this because it's got several small parts (batteries, broken plastic) that a dog can ingest and cause serious problems --Dangerous"
2,"Needs an editor, and an editorial","Teenagers may find this an engaging introduction to an otherwise dry, bureaucratic organization; face it, its hard to 'sex up' the UN. Its lack of substantive advice on how to reform the UN may leave them despondent and apathetic however. Given the gravity of the subject matter the wry wit and sarcasm of the author failed to entertain me. And while he succeeded in presenting the UN as the punching bag and scapegoat of the superpowers, he failed, due mainly to the constraints of the 'Beginners' format, to sufficiently forward discussion of what the UN and its member organizations due well. There are also several gross editorial errors that could be corrected, and, given the last few years, an update is sorely needed. If you're using this for a class, do make sure to team it with one of the more in depth treatments of the UN available through Amazon."
3,Good overview,"I agree with unambiguo's assessment of this book, although I think unambiguo might have graded it a little harshly. If you are even somewhat knowledgable about the UN, you will find errors of ommission or oversimplification in this book. As a result, I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is really interested in learning about the UN. However, for someone who is familiar with the UN, I found the book pretty humorous. I would suggest an alternative title of this book be, ""The Lighter Side of the UN,"" because I am afraid a beginner reading this book to really learn about the UN might be misled."
2,Perhaps I stopped reading too soon ...,"I abandoned the book after the fourth chapter. I am not a physicist, but I have read quite a lot about quantum theory and philosophy and Einstein's life, so I was very interested in the topic of the book. I found the author's style, however, very annoying. He does not keep to a timeline, but meanders off in five different directions page after page, and digresses left and right before telling what happened. The book reads more like a chat with a slightly tipsy gossip, who has to bring in every little bit of juicy information about the neighbors and their cats before relaying the main story. I finally gave up when the author tried to explain quantum theory by the properties of springs in the mattress where Einstein is supposedly making love to an actress! (Page 43 for those with prurient interests! ;)"
3,alright.,i think that liz is obessesing about connor to much. she should just get over him. i think that she should hook up with andy. then connor could get his nosed rubbed in everyth9ing that he lost. connor and liz together are just bad. this book though was good. i liked it. it got away from the whole jessica/jeremy/will and liz/connor thing. which by the way what is jessica doing with will! is the girl glutton for punishment. i think the angel and tia should break up.
5,Angel loses his money at the track,"Angel loses the money at the track by betting on horses,and his father fires him from Desmond's Auto. He doesn't know if he wants to go to Stanford University or not. He works at the Riot[a club where El Carro kids hang out,since Miller's Point,The Dairi Burger,Beach Disco,ect] most of the Sweet Valley High school kids hangouts have been destroyed in the earthquake. Melissa comes home from the hospital after attempting suicide."
4,Fats Cats,"I bought this recording as a gift to twin 12 year old girls with big feet. They loved ""Your Feets Too Big"" and I loved ""The Joint is Jumping"". They don't make them like this anymore. Refresh your memory cells or plant new ones.rjp"
2,Not good contact on 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee Windshield,"I'm updating my review. I thought after some break-in they would work better on my 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee, but the 22"" blade on the driver's side just does not make good contact with the windshield and leaves an area that will constantly have water on it during a rain storm right in the middle of the wiper. This makes these wipers unsafe for people that own a 2011-2013 Grand Cherokee. I bought some Valeo 600 series (bracket style) and they work perfectly and are almost half the price.The 900 series work better on my Lexus IS300, but if it is really cold the contact won't be perfect either. I'm going to just go back to buying the cheaper and better Valeo 600s."
2,Didn't fit.......,I ordered them for my 1999 Toyota Corolla but they didn't fit. They seem to be for some other model.
2,not worth it.,"does not work on my g35. The blade does not have a full and even contact with the glass as it only has effectively one point of contact, where it attaches to the arm. The top edge on my car does not clean and leaves about 2 inches. I also wrote a review for 18"" (unfortunately I bought both)"
1,"Doesn't fit ""hook type"" wiper arm.","Amazon says this part fits my Mazda, but it doesn't work on ""hook type"" wiper arms. There are no adapters at all, so it only fits ""top clip"" types. I usually just buy wiper blades at Walmart, and I've never seen anything but ""hook type"", usually with a few adapters that I throw away.These are some OE part. You would be wise to google the part number before buying this item, or you may end up returning it. Despite the error in the description, I was charged a restocking fee to return this.Never again Amazon!"
4,"Exellent Rain, Mist and other Water removal -- NO STREAKS!","One of best wiper blades I have encountered. Expensive, but excellent. Comes as single blade, not as pair, so know you will have to get two of them if you need two.Fit and grip windshield well, easily installed, and clear rain, mist, and even dirty splashed water completely and without any streaks.Highly Recommend if you can afford high end wipers, but what is more important than being able to CLEARLY see when driving?"
5,Best ever,"This our second set of Valeo Ultimate Blades. The first set was so impressive that we wanted to take the blades when we traded up to a newer car but the new car was a different size. So we purchased another set (22"" &24"") about 3 month ago. They continue to give quiet and very efficient service."
1,Overpriced and Overated,"I waited for two months of continual use before writing a review: 22"" blades on a Chrysler Sebring in mid eastern New Jersey in April/May.(45-75 degrees)Pros- Look niceCons- Lasted only 6 weeks, 8-10 uses, before the streaking and missed areas started. At 8 weeks became non-functional(12-14 uses). Windows very clean and I use Rain-X.Personal View- would not buy again. Would not buy at 1/2 the price paid because of the VERY short life span.Conclusion- These might work better in a different size or in an area where it doesn't rain and looks trump function."
2,Poor Service after talking with Customer Service,I have purchased 4 of these so far. One came Missing a Piece that hold the Wiper Blade in Place and I Lost one. I called and talked with a Customer Service Agent 3 weeks ago. They Were going to rush my out the parts I needed and Rush is normally faster than 3 Weeks. It's not an Easy Company to get a hold of and Now it's raining. My Best Plans to be ready for the Seasonal Rains are now failed unless I go purchase Wipers so other place. I'm not a happy Customer.
2,Great wiper blades... when they make contact with the windshield.,"These wiper blades are fantastic... when they work. The right blade makes full contact with the windshield and works great. The left wiper does not make full contact with the windshield. The blades i previously had on there (rainx latitude) didn't have this problem. I'm quite disappointed with this because I can see the potential of these blades, but unfortunately, they just dont seem to make full contact with the windshield."
1,crappy workmanship,blade difficult to install- broke part- requested replacement-neither manufacturer or vender responded to email - don't ever buy this-buy bosch-same type of blade
2,Wouldn't buy again - only worked great at first,"I thought these were great because they worked great at first, but it wasn't long until they started streaking (just a few months I believe). The streaking was very noticeable and annoying."
4,Valeo Wipers,"Found these wipers easy to install, and last much longer than anything else I've tried. Better than the Rain-X style."
4,Great Book,"This is a good book on preserving yourself for your husband. My 4 year old understood the ""princess getting married"" part, but the importance of ""the kiss"" went over her head. My 8 year old understood the entire book, but it seemed a little ""babish"" for her. I think this book is more geared for ages 5-7. Great book though!"
5,Every Mom and Daughter Should Share This Book!,"My Sister-in-law sent this book to my daughter for her birthday, along with some similarly themed ""princess"" things. The first time we read it as a bedtime story, I had tears in my eyes. The beautiful illustrations and important message were perfectly interwoven. We will read this book many, many, times over the years, and as my four year-old becomes a young woman, it will be a wonderful tool to use to open discussion about love and the true meaning of purity. Thank you Jennie Bishop for sharing your Mother's heart with all of us!"
2,Poor Reliability,These probe thermometers are a great idea and we all want them to work but the fact is they really dont. I have a four year old Polder that has failed after about eight uses (Thanksgiving turkey and Christmas Eve prime rib). Because of the poor reliability ratings I have babied it all its life by storing it in a remote cupboard in a Crown Royal bag. These low liftimes are really unaceptable and we should protest by not buying them. I suggest everyone go back to a good instant read thermometer and send the manufacturers a message they can undersand.Dan
4,works with pampered chef thermometer,"I am on third thermometer unit and have just discovered that I can replace the probe instead of the whole thing. DUH! This probe works with my Pampered Chef version. I also purchased the Acu-Rite BBQ thermometer for use on the grill, smoker and turkey fryer. Hopefully now have at least one working thermometer at all times!"
1,Junk! Don't waste your money!!,Probe failed within the first two hours in a temperature controled smoker that never went over 250 degrees. It was inserted in a pork roast that was under 180 degrees when it failed. JUNK!!
1,"Dreadful. Taste before buying, if you can.","I'd definitely see if there's a health food store that gives samples, or an organic restaurant that carries this, or a friend with it--try it before buying.I was used to French's and Heinz's yellow--staples in my fridge along with Grey Poupon and Gulden's. But I have been, in the last year, switching to organic products and produce. I purchased this to replace my about to expire French's yellow mustard.Well, this stuff is awful. I don't know why it has that odd taste--the vinegar, the particular mustard seeds?--but I put this on a sandwich and hated it. Then I decided to try again, a different day, and again, scraped it off the turkey. I could not bear it.I threw the nearly full bottle away.For now, it's back to non-organic mustard until I can taste other organic mustards and find one that doesn't make me wanna spit out my food.Pity.Mir"
4,Gripping But Ultimately Unsatisfying,"For those who like no holds barred non-fiction about sub-cultures this book will will be hard to put down. As in Leaving Las Vegas, I kept wondering how this guy was able to avoid getting arrested or seriously hurting or killing someone or himself for so long. I also wondered why he never tried to commit suicide, since his suffering seemed unbearable. As I read this book I kept waiting for him to finally clean up and get on with his life. It was frustrating to read how easily he would relapse after making the difficult effort to detox. After several of these cycles, I expected that by the end of the book he would have finally made it, but the ending leaves you hanging with uncertainty. It seems that he failed at every method of recovery that he tried. I can't imagine what finally worked, but if he writes another book, I will probably read it."
1,the ultimate guide to tax havens,"This book is very thin on information and of low quality, although the book gives a list of every tax haven I knew of and some I didn't.The amount of information on them is appalling the pages are mostly white space, and photos are non exsistent. The page on panama and Central America had only a link to a web site, while most others had such brief information it was not worth reading some of the pages.The book looks like it is compiled of copy and pasting of the internet and brief knowledge by the author anyone can find more information about these tax havens on the internet than this book provides.This book is definitely not worth the money due to the lack information provided on some of these tax havens."
4,simple gives hope,"Bought this book and have only gone through a few pages but I have to say its very good , excellent a bit concerned that the data is from the 70's but worth a look !"
3,Figurines came in plastic bag!!,"the figurines came in a plastic bag from the vendor with a playmobil sticker on the bag. i was giving this gift as a present and obviously cannot just wrap a plastic bag. i have purchased playmobil figurines before, and they always come in a box, just not from this vendor..."
3,Good pad for the price,This is a good dance pad for the price. I would have given it 4 or 5 stars but the pad tended to shift around too much under my feet during game play which made it more difficult to play ddr. It needs some better grips or to be a bit heavier to weigh it down. Other than that this pad works great.One thing I did notice is that you can't have a pad plugged into the first player slot and a controller or guitar hero guitar plugged into the second player slot because the dance pad will not work properly.
3,cheap,"you get what you pay for.they lasted a couple months, but as my fiancee and i progressed, these little babies started warping, buttons stopped working right or even responding at all. oh well..."
2,Fell short of my expectations...,"I picked this book up with high expectations. Unfortunately those expectations were dashed. While this book was a decent read, it is not a book I'd recommend. The primary reason is its slow pace. The main plot was interesting -- the police procedural side of the story, the subplots -- dealing in romance, etc. were not. While there was a small bit of action and alot of investigative activity, there was no excitement or tension associated with it. The book just plodded along spouting out one boring detail after another about the characters' dreary lives. It got so bad that I began daydreaming towards the end of the book (on the last tape) and I missed how the villain arrived on the scene for one last try at eliminating anyone that could reveal his/her identity. The sad thing is, I didn't care enough to rewind the tape to listen and find out. I was just glad for the book to end. The author has potential, but this is not a book I'd recommend."
3,"This is just the 2nd half of M. Moore's ""Sicko""!","This work looks at industrial nations that have universal health care. Michael Moore already did that in the second half of ""Sicko."" If you already know that other rich countries take health care as a right, then you will hear nothing new here.The title infuriates me. This does not talk about being sick around the world. What if you are sick in Brazil, South Africa, or India? The majority of countries are poor and couldn't dream of having the excellent health care systems described here. If you remember correctly, Moore spoke about health care in Cuba, a non-rich country. This documentary is too myopic for that.Finally, the narrator will just grate on your last nerves. He has a whiny, irritating voice like that one actor in ""The Princess Bride."" Yes, it is impressive that he speaks Japanese. Still, a whole bunch of viewers will press their stop buttons because they can't deal with his obnoxious voice."
2,Conflict of Intrest ?,"Author mentions his site www.ScriptingAnswers.com is run using PHP-NUKE ( bottom page 5 ) , however, when visiting the site, it is < not > PHP-Nuke being run at all !Instead, it is using Microsoft Dot.Net and Dot Net Nuke....totally not PHP_NUKE at all !Shame on the author for selling out PHP-Nuke to jump in bed with Microsoft and it's Dot.Net garbage.If using a personal/business site to tout a book, the author should make sure that site actually uses what is being written about !"
5,DINO AT HIS COOLEST,It doesn't get any better than this for Dean Martin fans. Houston is Dean at his coolest and Hits Again is for romance and candlelight.I bought both these albums as LP's way back in the sixties and they're still my two favorite Dino albums and now on CD the sound is even better ..
4,We Sold Our Soul for Rock 'N' Roll,"Good album although it is only a collection of their greatest hits. If you have their previous albums, then you already have the songs on this one."
5,Best of Black Sabbath's little brother...,"If there was a mini version of ""Best of"" Black Sabbath, I feel like this would be it. Great album."
5,BARE MINIMUM !!!,"LET ME TELL YA that if you like sabbath just a little then you must have this album. I'm 29 and I've had it for 20 years. I to wish it had some other hits like ""sabbra cadabra"" or ""killing yourself to live"" or even ""a national acrobat"". Well I believe that sabbath was definetly in their prime at the time this album came out. I am quite sure that this collection is theit best. I highly recommend all of their first six but at least buy this and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath because all three afformentioned songs are not included!! By the way my favorites here are : sabbath bloody sabbath,sweet leaf,black sabbath,and in my opinion their two best tracks ever PARANOID and N.I.B. THANK YOU THANK YOU PEOPLE GOD BLESS AND GOODNITE!!!!"
5,honest reviews on college life,"I bought this for my daughter who is in the middle of her college search and it seems to have helped her a lot. It's more interesting than a lot of the other college books out there because it's written by a student and includes lots of student surveys on all parts of campus life. Most importantly, the student responses sound honest and the author presents the information very clearly. I'm glad my daughter has a book like this to help her decision-making easier."
4,RIPPED FROM THE HEADLINES,"I was in the midst of reading this Al Quaeda thriller when the bombs went off in London. Although this tale of an Al Quada assassin dispatched from the Middle East to silence a captured terrorist before he can spill the beans to the CIA takes place a couple of years ago, it is just as relevant today. Sadly, it is obviously going to be equally relevant tomorrow. The book raises interesting philosophical issues about interrogation techniques, both from moral and efficacy points of view. Actually, the nationality and political point of view of the hired assasin seem ambigous. This may be on purpose, but I haven't finished the book so I don't know if this information is ultimately revealed."
3,Pretty good,"I must say, when you look at the cover you are going to expect the contents of the book to be a little different than what's in it. It's okay though, especially if you plan on drawing a manga that contains kendo, karate, and other forms of fighting. It gives you a run down on the gear you would use. So it's perfect for those who are interested in doing a action manga in that category."
5,great,This book was a great quick fun read I would recommend to anyone this story. Only criticism would be the very blunt writing style
4,A light and fun read,"Although a little unrealistic at times (several times I found myself saying to myself ""yeah, right... like that would happen!""), but an enjoyable read with an extra spoonful of western romance thrown in for good measure."
2,Just another western.,Not the best I've read. Could be great with more character development and a more detailed story. Could easily have been a two book tale.
4,Sagebrush,Enjoyed the book to the end. Had me guessing a couple of times as to the outcome. Definitely could have been an actual happening in the early west.
4,Sagebrush,"This book was well written, with an intriguing and suspenseful storyline. The characters were entertaining and well thought out. You can't miss if you like western and adventure novels."
2,awkward,"This was so hard to get through. The story telling was very awkward and some of the events were unrealistic. The overall story wasn't too bad, but the poor writing totally ruined it."
1,plastic crap,"It's a piece of plastic crap. Also, we were told that the bee in it died in the fossil but obviously they trapped the bee in plastic so I wouldn't call that a fossil."
3,Controlling Youth Through Popular Music,Similar to Wild In The Streets except the youth are controlled by the government through its main pop star. I would find it hard to believe that Pete Townshend of the The Who wasn't influenced by this movie when he dreamt up Tommy. Even the artwork looks the same.What keeps it from being a truely great film is the slow pace and acting by its two main stars. Both Paul Jones (of Manfred Mann) and Jean Shrimpton are a bore.Worth renting anyway.[DW]
2,"Flat & Dull- The ""disease"" must be a new wave of boredom.","I tried and i tried, but i couldnt get catch my disease to grow on me. Flat, no variety. Another artist i give a miss."
4,Solid playing,"music should be judged by one principle. If it sounds good it is good. This ablum sounds good to me. I enjoyed the rifts of Whatever it is. Catch my disease is a catchy sound enhanced greatly by nice usage of the keyboard in the background. Lee has a solid voice and he makes quality acoustic melodies. He dabbles in some emotion but he doesnt make it too heavy, overall the cd has good balance. Sometimes however the sounds tend to blend and this causes me to lose some interest in what im listening to.However, all in all its worth the 13 bucks."
1,This was worthless,"I was extremely disappointed when I received this. Basically cardboard and cheap thin plastic. No instructions were included, just two obscure non-deciperible drawings. I was making headway though, but the pieces wouldnt fit together as they were (aparently) supposed to, not in any other way. The plastiv 'doorway snapped as I attempted to snap it in place. I was not being unduly rough, in fact was being quite gentle in consideration of the fragility of the materials.Had it fit together in the proper manner (which it never did) it would not have held the weight of more than a small kitten.Thankfully Amazon is reliable and I received a full refund."
1,Good Idea Gone Terribly Wrong,"I threw this product away 15 minutes after assembling it. It is made of stiff carpeting material held together badly by four pieces of thin plastic. A gentle bump with a fist would cause it to fall apart.It is not waterproof, and not for outdoor use.You'd be far better off to spend a little more to get a satisfactory product."
4,Works very well,"I really liked the last Royal shredder we had and choice to buy another Royal.Our last Royal last four years and we never used a drop of shredder oil! No, I just didn't know you were suppose to use the stuff but it was an electronics problem that killed it.This shredder is more guarded at the point of entry.Works well and you can shred 16 sheets at a time. Rather quiet compared to the last Royal shredder."
1,worst shredder I've ever owned,"I shred everything that comes into the house and a cheap $30 shredder often lasts me 8 months. After reading a fair amount of positive reviews I thought this unit would be a good investment. I was wrong and after only 2 months of moderate use this thing is unusable. I tried to take it apart to repair it and no luck. When it was functioning the feed was awkward and difficult to use. The unit was also loud and the reverse button would require multiple presses (sometimes 10 or more) before engaging. In summary, this shredder is an over-priced piece of junk."
3,Long time user if this unit with some issues,"I have owned this unit for more than 6 years. It has been used in a home office with moderate to heavy use at time. The unit is still working today. It shreads DVDs and Credit cards without complaining as well as staples. It has now developed a squeek. Taking it apart and relubing the unit has not helped.Cons:Given todays prices this model is no longer a good vale. If do you have one it shoulkd last awhile. If your looking to buy a new one I sugget another model.I am not sure where 16 sheets came from but it struggles on half that number and always has.The sensor for the auto paper detect died after the warranty was up and now has to be used soley by the use of the power switch.When it was 100% sunlight would set off the paper detect sensor if it was left on automatic and facing the window. We would hear the unit running all by itself.The display is usless, does not tell you anything, Auto, Reverse..why... I never looked at it or would need to."
1,Shredder that does not cut it,"This shredder is best left for someone seeking to shred 2-3 pieces of 8-10 sheets of paper not more than 20 pounds. It is rather noisy, makes metal sounds, slot is not easy to get paper into. It also shuts off when two-thirds full, and jams frequently. Over-heated after 15 minutes of moderate business shredding.This is not a good office shredder, and was returned."
4,I'm Satisfied,"You have to give credit, these days, to any business that does exactly what it says. My order arrived at the price and well within the timeframe promised."
1,Expectations Never Delivered,"The Week of Salvation never satisfied my expectations oflearning the Traditions of Holy Week. Only few were mentionedby the Author. Instead, he quoted several Bible Verses in thiswork. In a sense a mini New Testament. It is a waste of moneyto buy this book. There are books reprinted and really worth ofbuying.Some months ago, I made a review of this book, but one manquoted that I was anti-catholic. Obviously, he equated myviews with that of Anti Popish movements. This is a gross error.Telling the truth is not an offense."
5,Interesting and accessible,"This is a very interesting, easy to understand summary of what Christianity means and how it compares to other religions of the world. It is on a par with C. S. Lewis's series of radio broadcasts that became his important book, Mere Christianity. Tom Wright is engaging, friendly, and even (as my wife says) cuddly in his explanation of the history and teachings of the church. If you want to understand more clearly what Christians believe and why, this series of talks is the best way to get started."
2,Disappointing -- You Could Learn More From Watching Free YouTube Videos,"This DVD is rather disappointing because the author (Rick Russell) spends more time standing behind a PODIUM than showing footage of actual offroad situations. Honestly, I learned more from watching free YouTube videos about ""4 Wheeling"" and ""4x4 Basics"" than watching this DVD. Although I did get a FEW minor tidbits of information here and there from Mr. Russell, I should have saved my money."
5,A Really Good Primer for Novices,"This book is excellent for a person who is interested in learning more about bookbinding, but has no practical experience. You will learn the techniques of two well-known masters of the trade, and you can do it with common household items. It requires no special tools or equipment. Also, the diagrams provided are extremely useful in illustrating each step of a particular activity. I personally was amazed at how much I could do without special equipment. This book is for people who would really like to learn more about the art of bookbinding and perhaps continue with it as a career. You will learn the terminology. You will learn how to sew or paste book bindings. You will learn how to use cloth and leather to cover your books."
4,Glenn Tilbrook: One For The Road,"I'm biased of course, but I think Glenn's second album shows real growth and a welcome chance for Glenn to work with outside people. He's got a great new band the Fluffers and used some amazing session musicians from Nashville on TAPP. I love the campy, retro instrumental ""One For the Road""inspired by the documentary chronicling his solo tour of America in an RV. (out on DVD on January 24, 2006!) Glenn shows amazing insight with the unforgettable ""Untouchable"" and collaborates with Rugburns frontman Steve Poltz on the hilariously titled ""Hot Shaved Asian Teens"" (email spam never sounded this good.) If you dig this CD, check out the book ""Squeeze: Song By Song"" and my favorite Squeeze album ""Play"" from 1991. In the current musical climate, Glenn is the pop poster child for all of us: do what you love and love what you do."
5,Fleetwood Mac Rumors,This album brought back so many great memories. I loved ( still do) Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Knicks and the price from Amazon makes it a bargain all the way around.
4,Rumours,"I purchased the vinyl LP when first released and used it for demoing stereo speakers. There is definite audio differences between the LP and the mp3. There is warmth and low end missing on the mp3, but the songs and musicianship still come through strong making it a should have for anyones' collection."
5,Awesome,I enjoy this CD very much. This is one of the CD's that every song on it is awesome. This gave me a chance to own the best of Fleetwood Mac.
3,"Nice songs, but...","I need to replace my CD of this, which was nicked from its case. I like it because it's a good album filled with nice songs played and sung well. But this argument over it's classic status is like people arguing whether the lettuce or the onion is the best part of a hamburger. New musical ground broken - zero. Influence on other artists (cover bands excepted) - zero. So it's not a classic except if measured in sales."
5,Among The Most Important Albums Of The 1970s,"Though Fleetwood Mac had been together for many years, it wasn't until this was released in 1977 that they tossed the music world on it's ear. Rumours really made everyone sit up and take notice. The album won several awards and deservedly so. Whether top 10 singles or just regular album cuts, every song is a hit and instantly recognizable. The band had so much major talent, it's no wonder they enjoyed so much success. Unfortunately in later years ego problems(among others)got in the way & there were a few personnel changes & later albums were not quite up to snuff. If you only need one Fleetwood Mac album, this is THE ONE. Highly recommended."
3,WATERGATE-ROCK,"This was just what we needed! Her, her, her. She thinks she is the re-incarnation of a Welsh witch. I've had kooky girlfriends too. But none with the silky sexiness of miss Nicks. The song Dreams inspired our selfishness, and took us to new heights. Many a people were conceived as she warbled her way into rock history. The rest of the lp is accessible but not particulaly thrilling. In 1976 the cosmos was tiled with RUMOURS, rumors of Stevie and you."
4,monster debut,"I really knew part of this stuff because I already had a ""best of"" record but no matter if you know the songs, they catch you over and over again. The first songs will blow your mind away...""Rock the nation"", ""Bad motor scooter"", ""Space nation #5""... they all rule! To me it's a kind of mistery how this band did't get the attention they deserved. Ronnie plays as a real guitar hero and Sammy's voice gives a personal taste to all the work. Obviously I do recommend this record to anyone who wanna rock...don't forget to play it on eleven on your stereo!"
4,The Montroses & Hagar-rock history at it's best. So's this.,"Early development by some of the biggest names in rock and roll. Rock The Nation and Space Station #5 were some of the best early hard rockers of their time - and the same is still true today. Of course Sammy left and went of his own solo career before Van Halen and the Montrose bros did the Gamma 1,2 &3 thing before going away. But this is great music. The way rock useta' and still should be."
5,Best car seat around,My daughter loves this car seat! Cute fabric and lots of room for her to stretch. It must be the most comfortable and safest car seat around.
3,Interesting take on Nativity story,"I am of Irish descent and wanted to us this in the classroom for preschool children. the book is beautifully illustrated, but the story is a bit complex for young children...my opinion is that it would have been better for my second graders last year rather than my preschoolers this year. It is a book that will spark much conversation and questions with the opportunity for further research and study of ancient Ireland, Saint Brigid and the Nativity story and setting. I bought this book online without any knowledge of what I was purchasing. I do love the story and it will become part of my own family's tradition."
3,Buyer beware!,"This classic performance of the Tchaikovsky concerto is one of the great ones, but some serious glitches in the recording itself are extremely distracting. At several (at least three) points in the first movement, the sound suddenly changes, so that the level drops or the piano-tone sounds very different, or the soloist-orchetra balance is altered. The reasons for this are not clear to me, though I know that it is not a manufacturing defect. If you're looking for a recording of this concerto, you would do better to buy Marth Argerich's 70's studio recording with the Royal Philharmonic under Charles Dutoit (search for ""Argerich Tchaikovsky Dutoit""), which is similarly magnificent but doesn't force you to accept any sonic glitches."
4,Almost perfect,"I got my new TV in stunningly fast time. It took only 10 minutes to open the box and connect to my system. The picture is awesome, and sound quality is good as well. On screen navigation is simple, and I looked at the manual only an hour after watching the beautiful picture. Please note, this is not a perfect buy, because the spec sheet is wrong. According to the Amazon description, and the manual, there are supposed to be additional connections on the side of the TV, but in fact, there are none. No serial, additional component or s-video on the side, or anywhere, they simply don't exist. But otherwise it is one of the best LCD HDTV's for the money. XBox-360 hook up was simple, and in game mode, my nephews tell me Gears of War and Call of Duty 3 are simple awesome to play now. If you are buying and planning to use the additional connections keep shopping, this is not for you. Otherwise, no complaints."
2,I got a dud,"Received this TV from amazon last night and within 30 min of turning it on, the sound went out. I've had more time to mess with all the settings today and everything is set properly. It doesn't seem to matter what I have hooked up to it as far as A/V equip goes either. Right now it's a basic coax cable, but no matter what channel, when it messes up, the whole TV is going haywire. After turning it off and then back on it fixes the problem, but only for a minute or so. After multiple experiments, it stays on for about 30 min after sitting turned off for an extended period of time, then after turning it off and on, it will only work for about one minute after....I did that about seven times and every time the sound messed up. About half the time the video was also scrambled and then went out....simply disappointed and frustrated as now I have to deal with Samsung customer service....awesome."
2,Waste of time and effort,This is by far the biggest slap in the face to any fan of rap. Spider Loc is a horrible rapper with zero talent. 50 was obviously just trying to find a permanent replacement to The Game but he should have continued searching. It's no wonder this cat hasn't dropped a main stream album yet. Keep your money in your pocket and save up for some real music.
2,Not the original commercial versions,"This was OK, but not outstanding. Sound quality so-so. I think it may have been from a live performance 10-20 years after the songs were originally released. Thanks for making them available, though."
2,Better Options,"There are better options. For the price, this is really disappointing. There are a lot of complaints about the drawer spacers, which I easily found. However, there are 64 drawers and I found the 8 spacers, enough for one row. I'm having a bit of a problem finding the other 7 rows worth. Theres drawers need separators for my desired purpose, so now I am forced to either buy some (if they're even available) or figure out a way to separate the remaining 56 drawers. Frustrating. I wish I had just bought a cheaper option at Harbour Freight."
3,parts cabinet,"This parts cabinet has many drawers for storing screws, nuts, bolts. It is ok but I do wish the drawers were made of a more rigid material as they are very flimsey and wrapped so much they rub against each other. I really wish I would have spent more money on one that was made better"
2,One shot deal (hopefully),"On one hand beautiful scenery and Stapleton's (et al) acting make this film bearable. On the other hand, the story is basically a modernized mishmash of past movies and offers very little originality to the viewer. If you know people involved or have absolutely nothing better to do then this film will help pass time. Otherwise you'll find much better and original both in the theater and on DVD release.Philip Chidel obviously learned something about directing before making this film (hence the two stars), let's hope that he can do the same with his writing before his next attempt. And please, please spare us a mishmashed sequel!"
2,lower your expectations,"Do not start out buying the entire series. My wife and I sign off most nights watching As Time Goes By. Having great admiration for Judi Dench, although not familiar with her husband, this seemed like a sure winner. We tried our best to get into this show, but failed. I fear the title song heard too many times in a row would drive one mad. Spend your money elsewhere, this one is in the back of our closet."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"My 4-year-old son and I both love the ""old"" PJ Sam games. So needless to say I was very excited to see the new software in store. I picked one up and gave to my son for Christmas and much to my dismay, it just wasn't the same. Moving from scene to scene is so slow. It seems like the new game is less sophisticated than the older ones. Very disappointing for me and my son."
2,Life is Rough When You Play This Game,"Like one other review of this game, I must say I am disappointed. I bought this game for my 6 year old nephew to play when he visited. He was so excited when we loaded it onto the computer. He was excited when the screen came on. Then he started playing the game. There were constant interruptions in gameplay no smoothness of movement between scenes as we have come to expect from the other Pajama Sam games. We adjusted the computer running speed to see if that would help, it did a little bit. However, when he completed it the first time, he decided to try it again. The only change in location of anything was the jar for the fireflies and the trading cards within the scene. No other changes were apparent. He gave up after two times and has not touched the game since. After purchasing this game, my nephew says that he ""likes the first ones better"". We will be sticking with the first three games, thank you very much. Very disappointed in the game."
1,Buy the OLD Pajama Sam games- NOT this one!!,"My 5 year-old son absolutely loves the Pajama Sam series of games by ""Humongous Entertainment."" He received this most recent (and much more expensive) Pajama Sam-- ""Life is Rough"" for Christmas. It is extremely poorly made compared to the previous versions of PJ Sam. This is also the first Pajama Sam I have seen made by Atari. The screens do not move smoothly, Pajama Sam's voice is not in synch with the movements on the screen, and the general flow of the game is cheaply done. The makers of the first few Pajama Sams did some wonderful work- smooth scenes, cute characters etc..., and it is very clear that this latest version by Atari was made in a rush and the final product is clearly lacking as a result. If you are considering buying a great kid's computer program, skip this one... Try the ""Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and Lightening Aren't So Frightening"" or find the Pajama Sam that came free in kid's snack pack boxes about six months ago."
3,displeased,I sent it back without opening it in good faith and have not received a credit for it as of a few days ago. I am very displeased with the service from this site.
4,Nice Art Set - Buy somewhere else,I saw this same art set at our local Toys 'R Us and didn't immediately buy it because I wanted to see if I could get it cheaper on Amazon (which is often the case). Toys 'R Us was selling the same item for $34.99 which is needless to say where I purchased it. Looks to be a very nice art set for my daughter.
3,Some good stuff but..,This book's forte is that it give detailed instructions with pictures for all of the exercises. The bad thing is that the routines in here just contain enough exercises to hit all of your muscles.
4,Well worth the money!,"I've been working out for years, but my weight training workouts were something I worked out by trial and error and centered on machines available in my gym. I started with Volume 1 of this series and found it an excellent guide to using many free weights, as well as some machines. I like the variety of routines and the explanations -- just enough detail without excess text. I worked through Vol. 1 twice, then purchased Vol. 2. The lack of spiral binding in Vol. 2 was a major handicap, so I took it to Staples and spent a few $ for spiral binding, which makes it much easier to use. There are enough new exercises to make the voume a worthy sequel to Vol. 1 -- a lot of the illustrations are recyled from Vol. 1, but it's very handy to be able to quickly review an exercise when you need reminding. For the money, this is an excellent guide to working with a combination of free weights and machines, but I'd start with Vol. 1 first."
5,My comfy comfs,"Love these socks and they are holding up well. I dont work in dirt but they give me the protection and comfort I was looking for. No sweat, no bunching up, and all cozy."
5,I still LOVE these guys!,"For anyone who rocked in the 70's - this was one of the best groups around.They are still one of my favorite groups, and this is a good collection."
4,Rock or Groove your Doobie,"Vol.1 is for guitar-rocker/Tom Johnston fans; Vol 2 for fans of Michael Mcdonald influenced Doobies; Pat Simmoms sings/plays on both vols. Both band incarnations had critical/commerical success (Black Water vs. What a Fool Believes) & should be included in a serious music collection. the issues is more about being a mood to hear 1 band version instead of the other. ""Each"" band deserves a listen.Note every pre 1990s Doobies album had a different cast of members!"
3,"lots of suction, poorly designed details","the suction cant be beat. best of all that I've tried including the Meile.faults are cheap front wheel, it seeks out things to bang into, even when your going strait it will veer off and bang into everything. Door frames are all chiped up. accessory lid is flimsy. better off without it all together except the accessories keep falling out ( they wont stay in their molded spot) wish they spent more thought on those details."
4,Oldie but Goodie,"McConnell has done an excellent job with this book. Have read it several times. It is and older book with newer books covering some of the same territory, but it is well written and a good read for the layman as well as the minister.McConnell has put together a good, solid work that is well worth the read for any Methodist or minister or layman interested in protestant theology and Methodist theology in particular.He has a clear understanding of Wesley which comes through in this book.J. Robert Ewbank, author of ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,Trying to be two books at once,"I hate to burst the bubble here, but I was disappointed in this book. In my opinion, it's trying to be two different books: a memoir of therapy and an informal history of the relationship between dogs and people. The jumps between the two genres are awkward and disorienting, and often have the unintended effect of trivializing the very serious issues Wells is discussing. In the midst of a moving description of a session with the therapist, she will suddenly shift to discuss some particular breed of dog. It's almost as if the dog stuff is there to distract her (or us) when the material gets too heavy.I also would seriously question the ethics of the therapist in this story, but given the way the story ends, that's a cheap shot on my part."
4,Good Early Period Anthology,"I bought this to hear the single version of ""Dark Star"" basically. It's not a bad compilation for the Dead's Warner Brothers output. ""Jack Straw"" and ""Tennessee Jed"" among my favorites. I don't know why in the world ""Black Peter"" was included with other much better songs out there. Buy ""Live/Dead"" first if you want to start at their best."
4,Cooper Has Too Many Great Songs For Just One Album!!,Greatest Hits signals the swan song for the original group. It is all of the most popular songs from the group on one album and it is essential for anyone's collection. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars instead of 5 out of 5 only for the reason that it does not contain any of the more shocking songs like Ballad of Dwight Frye and I Love The Dead.
3,"Important concepts, lackluster book","This book brings into the mainstream the fundamentals of poverty that are largely ignored or unknown by the general public. The information is solid. The writing, unfortunately, leaves something to be desired. The text is redundant and didactic, and on the level of the sentence, it's boring. A better writer could have written this book in about two-thirds the pages. You could read selected chapters of this book for key concepts, but unless you need the same metaphors pitched to you ten different ways, pick one of the many better written povery exposés out there."
3,Interesting at first,"This book was interesting in the beginning, despite the fact the lead character is a total brat. I did not care for Julie at all, she was a complete and total spoiled brat. Like mentioned previously, it was good in the beginning until Julie goes to America, but it becomes a personal family drama, which was quite uninteresting. The beginning and experiences with Hitler in Austria was good enough for me to give it 3 stars."
4,"Koga's Zero, The fighter That changed World War II","This 1995 book is of historical value to students of the WWII Pacific theater naval air wars, particularly combat between fighter aircraft.However,the content of this book is a word for word copy of a book issued in 1990 by the same author, Jim Reardon, titled ""Cracking the Zero Mystery:How the US Learned to Beat Japan's Vaunted WWII...."". It just has a different title. I bought both books thinking they were different, and was disappointed to find that between the covers, the two books were virtually identical, format, pictures, chapters, et all.So, one could buy this book OR ""Cracking the Zero...., but don't buy both."
4,Some great hidden stuff here . . .,"My guess is that if you're looking at this album, you're looking for an introduction to classic big band swing hits like ""Sing, Sing, Sing"" and ""In the Mood."" The CD serves this purpose well. However, the best reasons to buy this CD are tracks 9, 10, and 11. Lionel Hampton and Illinois Jacquet tear it up on ""Flying Home."" This is the best cut of ""Four Brothers"" I've ever heard. And the trombone solo on ""Turn me Loose"" (I think it might be Al Grey) is great stuff. If you want an introduction to the big band period, this is pretty good, but you may find yourself hooked on the later big bands, which are much more impressive. It's a good buy."
4,"Good, but not always the kids' favorite","That said, you might want to try the other flavors in these first. I've found that most kids prefer the berries and watermelon flavors over these tropical ones (ever seen them marked down in a supermarket? It's usually the tropical flavor). If you have kids that like the coconut, pineapple, etc. mixture, then be sure to grab these. But, if you're unsure or if you're buying them for a crowd, I'd go for the more traditional flavors first. These are very good, however, and I do recommend them!"
5,great music,The wait for Habib Koite's music was (almost) worth it. Rare talent and beautifully produced.
3,Can't Quite Recommend,"This is a pretty good extension to John Ganapes first tutorial on the Blues, ""Blues You Can Use"". The songs are interesting and, as does the first book in the series, it contains well thought-out instruction on playing the Blues. However, it has a serious drawback. There are no backing tracks for songs on CD. Also, since it does not provide the tempo (in beats per minute), one has to spend valuable practice time building one's own backing tracks (unless you have your own band handy). The book claims one can adjust the channel selection in order to hear only the rythm guitar. I did not find this to work very well. These days, there are plenty of tutuorials that include backing tracks, as part of the package. For this reason, I cannot quite recommend it."
1,barstool checkered flag,I was disappointed when my husband went to put the stool together it wasn't even the one I ordered and it was missing some parts in order to put it together. Very disappointed. when I received my confirmation it said the one I ordered was in stock but it might take 1-2 days to process. So they had the one I ordered but I was sent the wrong one which was a swivel one with a backrest. I would like to know what they are going to do about this!Donna Fish
5,Inspiration,"I have lived on the fringe of the world Bob describes, and I was amazed at how he could take me inside. The descriptive language made this one of those books that is your home for a while.It left me with a great many things, but mostly the hunger for what is next from this author. Bob has many hats, and wears them all so well.Let's hope he puts the author hat back on.John H. Bidwell"
1,It wont work,"I am now writing this review because we bought this game at a book fair I hate to say almost 5 years ago or more. Why I still have it, not sure you know kids they want to keep everything. When trying to install it then, it installed but then said please insert original disk to play. Well we only had the one, what I felt was the original disk. If this was just the install disk then where is the one needed to play. I write this now because I tried installing it again after finding it. I still get this message. Not that it mattters now really my child is older and had gotten over it but we found the disk and tried to see could we get it to work this time. NOT!!! Now if I bought this product today would it work I can't tell you.I just know that I was unable to get this product to work."
1,Don't buy this,"I installed this computer on a Gateway 700S and it doesn't work at all. I went to Atari's technical support and followed the suggestions for updating video, sound, and DirectX, which didn't help at all. Now I have a game I can't return and can't play."
1,BUGGS,"We found this game would not play on my new dell computer and only played on my husband's new alienware system with choppy sound and graphics - and he bought this computer specifically for gaming. So I think the software must be defective. We have backpack and lost city also - they play well and my son (2.5) likes them both, but i found that with lost city all the games were about numbers - ignoring other concepts like colors, letters and shapes. Try this software at your own risk, maybe they will fix the bugs. I found tech support to be a frustrating, time consuming experience with an automated system that was confusing and annoying. Good luck."
3,Only Gentry is worth reading,I had to read this book for college and found Gentry the only author worth reading. The others were hard to follow or did not make their case very well at all.
2,Not really shampoo - more like conditioner..,"My puppy hates baths and I thought I would try this waterless shampoo as an alternative to a bath. I used the product exactly as per the instructions but it didnt clean my puppy one bit! He is pure white, so it is pretty easy to see if a product has helped clean him up or not.The only reason I have given it two stars is that it is like using a good conditioner. It makes my puppy's fur very smooth and soft and makes him smell really good!"
2,The State of the Genre. . .,"""The Fifth Ring"" showcases the current state of the fantasy genre - and boy, that's a depressing way to look at things. This overstuffed tome is packed with all the usual fluff: magic rings, power-mad sorcerer kings, reluctant young heroes, and all the rest. It's like someone took all these elements and threw them into some Fantasy-o-Matic machine and ""The Fifth Ring"" plopped out the other side. No, it's not the worst fantasy novel I've ever read (that distinction falls upon Dennis L. McKiernan's ""Iron Tower""), but it's generally boring and fails to accost my attentions. How anyone could compare this newbie author to better ones, like Terry Brooks, is beyond me. It is passionless dribble, better left sitting on the shelf. I hate to bash a first-timer, but this is exactly the kind of work this genre does NOT need. Fortunately we have George R. R. Martins and David Gemmels in the field, or all might well be lost."
1,Bring on the Hook!,"This is a not very original story with heavy ""borrowings"" from Robert Jordan as to plot and character. The main character is obviously based on Rand al Thor as is the ""magic."" The author even goes so far as to borrow Jordan's one dimensional female characters with their ""looks"" and ""crossed arms."" Shades of Egwene!Buried in the book are such howlers as the two main protaganists in their main ""love scene"" feeling ""sexy."" I kid you not - in a fantasy novel in a make believe world."
1,Orlocks and White oh no Rose Gold,"Take a number of classics, fix them up into a story and then there you are. Five stars all over the place. M-Orlocks are bad guys that live underground. I have a white, oh no, rose gold ring that is bad for me. And oh wait, I must populate it with unbelievable characters and events. They say imitation is the greatest form of flattery. I can't believe the authors in question would be flattered by this. Overblown, clearly derivative (being genorous) why waste your time?"
3,"Good WuShu, but...","I give this 3 stars.1. This really was more about flash than martial arts. The forms were geared to showiness, not real martial arts. They were good, but it wasn't practical.2. Worse, there didn't seem to be any real feel to what they were doing. Mystical mumbo jumbo, standard tricks, and all forms done to speed without any consideration as to how the forms SHOULD be done really detract from the show.Overall, that's enough in my mind to take away two stars. It was a great show, if you like Contemporary WuShu. If you want tradtional martial arts, look elsewhere, this isn't it."
4,HP Wireless Printing Upgrade,"This product is very convenient and works instantly once the software is downloaded to your computer. It has great range too! I take my laptop around the house and print from other rooms easily. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the hardware (AC adapter, and usb adapter) seem kinda bulky. I would hope that they would be more sleek and smaller. But, overall, I love the unit."
1,HP support advised to buy this for MAC!!,"I have HP Officejet AIO J4580 at home. At the shop I was told it works wirelessly with MAC . HAHA. It doesn't.I do live in a country where sales people's knowledge of the product is: ""oh its very nice for you "", so I should have known better.After some emailing with HP support they advised me to buy the"" Wireless printing upgrade kit"" to make it work wirelessly, and I did mention I have a MAC. HA HA HA! It doesn't . The world seems to be full of sales people who'll tell you any lie just to make a sale.Well HP, my fancy AIO printer is on it's way to bin, followed by the useless upgrade kit. What a waste of time and money.I'll be waiting for Apple to come up with a very thin AIO MACBOOK that wirelessly prints, scans, faxes and whips up a cappucino while I get ready to spend some quality time at home. Anything else is just not worth the effort. MAC for president!"
2,Not Happy With It,"I couldn't get this to stay connected to the computer, the USB overheated. Even within clear distance it was hard to connect. Wasn't worth the trouble."
1,HP WIRELESS PRINTING UPGRADE KIT,Bad News.. I could get absolutely any support in order to make this upgrade work from the manufacturer after several attempts. But they are just eager for that wonderful survey from me. It was not a pleasant experience dealing with the manufacturer.
2,A waste of money,"Purchased the HP wireless printing upgrade kit and it doesn't work. After installing/unstalling multiple times!Time to take to return - time - gas and inconvenience, is just not worth it!"
3,The World of the Celts by Simon James,"This was a solid, comprehensive historical read. Did this give anyone a better insight into Celtdom? That depends on whether one is a Celt or not. If nothing else, I understand the breadth of the Celtic people(s) at their height of expansion and evolution. A very inventive and talented people that I am proud to be descendant from."
3,Celtic History,Great starting point for anyone looking to discover the history of the Celts. This book is also accompanied by many illustrations and photos. I enjoyed reading it
5,Finally Marvel Brings Out the Classics !!,A great compilation...it's beena long wait for the pre hero Marvel comics !!! Hopefully this is the first reprint of many !!!
5,The Philanderer - An Unpleasant Play,The plays of Bernard Shaw span many years and cover many topics. They force us to critically view how success in the world is judged. They demonstrate how any of us may unknowingly be an accomplice to or a participant in activities to which we stringently object on a moral basis.
1,Never got it!,"I ordered this dvd at the end of March and was told it was to be received between August 8-25. It is now May 4th. I contacted the seller on the 26th and got one reply saying that ""you should have gotten it by now"". Yeah, I know. Still waiting........"
1,A waste of money,"First one arrived broken, replacement lasted 4 months in mild weather. very flimsy for an outdoor spinner. Don't."
1,Good for one use,"Was very disappointed with this cute teddy and stockings. When they say one size, they mean one size if you are average sized. I am a size 10-12 with DDs. I put the teddy on very carefully and was pleased that it seemed to fit; however when I went to adjust my boobs, it split under one arm, and being made of pantyhose material, it ran all the way up and down that side, so that even if I sewed the armhole, it would still have a huge unsightly runner in it.I gave the hose to my daughter, who is very slim. She put her thumbs through them trying to put them on, as the material feels brittle.It was inexpensive enough that I didn't bother returning it."
1,Dont waste your money.,"Poor build quality, terrible performance, and the lighting is cheesily overdone, whereas the pictures on their website make it look awesome. Dont waste the time or money."
5,~*~ I LOVE NEWSIES ~*~,I love the newsies! I had to see the movie then and i wound up buying it i only borrowed the book but i am buying it now!!!!!
2,The movie is sooooo much Better!,"OK, for all of you Newsies fans, which I am among, the movie is soooo much better! The book is much too simple. The movie had gorgeous actors and the book just can't show that. The movie was a lot better! I loved the movie, but the book just wasn't good. It's was OK, I guess, but even saying that is pushing it."
5,The Desert Island Album!,"This is surely one of the 10 albums I'd take if I had to be stranded on a desert island! Rollins is a phenomenon. This is surely one of the best jazz albums ever. Just spend some time with it and you'll see, and did you ever hear Jim Hall swing like this! If you love jazz, you must have this in your collection!"
4,Could have had more detail.,Good introductory book. It could have had a lot more specific information on kayaks and gear.
1,Dreadful to say the least,"I got this at Home Depot for doing some things on my computer. I got it and the very, very thin solder that they did not say you needed and I had to go to 4 different places. Then as I got home I sat down and started soldering and it would not give me a good joint. Then as i put the soldering iron into it's case furious that i only made a half decent joint the tip broke as I was puting into the section just for it.Go get a normal soldering iron. It may be less safe but at least it works."
1,It certainly is a cold heap....,"I tried to get this thing to work in a manner that even resembled adequate but to no avail. I'm not an expert when it comes to soldering but I've done it enough times to know what works and what doesn't. This is a waste of $20 and any time that you invest in trying to make it work.However, after throwing it out I realized, almost immediately, that I had thrown out something valuable: the batteries."
4,Easy to carry,This one replaced the Craftsman version that was misplaced. This version seems to be made with a little more precision. The locking mechanism is much more refined. On the down side they totaly forgot to put an edge on the knife and they made them of a stainless steel that is more prone to staining than the Craftsman.
2,IDL MultiTool,"I purchased this to replace a previous multitool labeled identical to this. The fit and finish of this last tool is disappointing. It appears that it was manufactured with tooling that was completely wore out. The file does not have sharp edges and the straight screwdrive does not have a flat tip. The pivot operates very rough for the plier. My previous tool had stainless steel stamped around the pivot. The specification of the tool as posted indicate it is made of stainless steel. However, my tool shows signs of rust within a month of owning it. I am very disappointed based on previous purchases of the same tool."
5,fantastic,the candy taste great and the item came earlier then expected i even tried to eat the scorpion but the taste was kinda strange but it wouldn't be a problem once your used to it
3,Cheap batteries,"The replacement batteries (I ordered two) were very reasonably priced and worked for a couple of hours in a pinch, but beware of shipping charges NOT within the published Amazon Marketplace guidelines. When I complained of excessive shipping and handling charges and the breach of protocol, the owners responded that they needed to make a bit of a profit, after all. I would advise them to be simply raise their price by a couple of dollars, a more honest approach to earning profits than hiding it in handling charges."
5,Camera Battery Review,"Exact match for Mfg. Battery at a fraction of the cost. Works well, good battery life.Order shipped quickly and correctly.I would definitely buy replacement/additional batteries from here."
5,Perfect Fit and Cheap,We recently purchases an Olympus Stylus b/c our previous digital camera ran on AA batteries and we went through entire packs of batteries on vacaction. The battery arrived 1 day earlier than the expected arrival date and was a perfect fit at a fraction of the cost at what an additional battery would have cost from Olympus!
3,An authoritative history of Mead.,"This is a very authoritative history of mead, stretching from its earliest know use by the peoples of Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley, through the middle ages, and to its decline in these modern times. Included in this foray is a discusion of the origins of spices, and differences between meads and ales. In the last quarter of the book are some common recipes, and a description of how to go about brewing mead. My only complaint is that I wish there was a more complete description of the process."
1,Irrelevant content,"The first 90% of this book is written by Lt. Colonel Robert Gayre. This part of the book is dedicated to the history of mead and related alcoholic drinks. Naked racism, extreme conservatism, snobbism, awkward language style, low readability and long, boring historic reviews are characteristic for this part of the book. The Lt. Colonel speaks of great English civilization, wonderful Aryan race and superior Anglo-Saxon race, trying to bring enlightenment to the primitive and degenerate other human races. In this part there is not even a trace of any knowledge about mead making necessary for those who would like to do it.The last 10% of the book - Brewing Mead - is written by Charlie Papazian. This part is too short and too general to make a useful contribution to a beginner. The recipes are not precise and not detailed enough for a real success.If you are a historian interested in racist theories centered on the English and the Aryan myths, this may be the book for you."
1,YOU DO NOT GET WHAT IS PICTURED,"I ordered this to connect my camera to my telescope. The version I received does not look anything like the picture, frankly I am afraid to connect it to my camera. It does not have the stops T-mounts usually have to prevent it from rotating in the Camera mount (meaning that when you attach the camera, if the camera begins to rotate under its own weight, it can disconnect and you camera will crash to the floor. The T- mount I received it is extemely thin and flimsy unlike the robust one pictured in the ad. It will cost me more in time taking it to the post office and paying to return it, I might as well dump it in the garbage. All my experiences with Adorama prior to this point have been positive, hope this is not signs of the way the company is heading."
1,Do NOT anticipate this as another Conan Movie,"Man,this movie is just plain horrible. Horrid acting, horrid script, horrid everything. Just ignore this among the Robert E Howard line of movies(Conan The Barbarian, Conan The Destroyer, and Red Sonja). The others are way better, this one just doesn't do anything for me. Also, Kevin Sorbo is not much of an Atlantean Barbarian.. He's not animalistic, he's too pretty boy like. He makes me think of Fabio(Bleck). 'Nuff said; Find a better movie like any of the other previously stated movies."
5,auntester,This product really works. we have been using it for more then 9 years now. This is the best price that I have found for it. My dog is alive because of this medicane.
1,Upset,"I'm really upset because Denosyl has only 7 months until expires validity. I bought 12 boxes, and now, what should I do whit the 5 that will be expired ?? You must put the validity on site, then we can decide how many boxes we should buy."
2,Lousy wraping for a delicate product,"I have no complaints on the product itself, as my cat is still under treatment and all seems fine.About the way it was packed, on the other hand, it couldn't possibly be worse...I ordered two packs of 30 which came poorly wraped, with no hard enclosure. Because of that, some of the blisters were open and I had to throw 5 pills away.Hope others don't waste their money as I did."
3,"Nice leather case, poor design on the belt clip though",The phone case is nice made from soft leather with a nice Samsung logo on it. The clip however is cheap plastic that makes the case twice as wide. I can see the clip breaking easily. I wish the clip was more slim line so it doesn't feel like you are lugging a suitcase on your hip.
2,Interesting but inaccurte,"Although this book provides an interesting introduction for novice to Buddhism, it does not provide an accurate picture to the later development of Buddhism. It appears that the facts are based on some layerman introductory literatures, but there seems to be insufficient research into the topics in depth. At least, in my opinion, not sufficient to provide a non-biased introduction for beginners and layerman. It appears more as a criticism against the later Buddhism than to provide a objective survey of the subject. There are ample literatures that discuss later Buddhism in an entirely different light from the author depicts in his work. I suggest readers should be cautioned that some of his observations are subjective rather than objective and factual."
1,AWFUL!!!,"I hardly know where to begin with how disappointed I was with this book. I actually checked the original publish date sure that it would be around 1950, and was surprised that the first printing was this century! The dialog and writing style was almost archaic, making the characters cardboard. With conversation such as ""You disapprove of me, don't you, my stern little secretary with the golden eyes?"", and description such as ""Which exposed a V of tanned flesh and dark curling body hair."" I thought both the H and H were prigs, which I suppose means they were compatible, but not people I wanted to read about. Needless to say, I deleted this one from my Kindle pretty fast!"
1,Penetrating eye-watering cheap ladies' perfume odor,"Don't use this product unless you enjoy smelling like a bordello. I put a small quantity on my arms this morning, and since then have been walking in an embarrassing cloud of a cheap ladies' perfume odor that can probably be detected a block away. I have been sneezing incessantly, my nose has been running, my eyes are watering, and I can't get rid of it despite having scrubbed my forearms twice already."
4,Does the job,"once you tweak the leveling its a done deal. I do wish they would make them in bright colors. RED orange etc...however this would increase price since they probably are machining these from reminant pieces.If you have an older Craftsman Saw ( 1950-60) as I do you can't find a better solution, Trust Me."
3,IDL Tools Keychain Multi-Tool,"This is a nice little tool to carry on a keychain or keep in a desk drawer, once you can get the hinges loosened up. Also,contrary to its appearance, it is not made from brush-finished stainless steel--it rusts very quickly if exposed to moisture in a wet jacket pocket. The shape of the pliers is especially good for grabbing onto and pulling out staples that have been mutilated by a standard staple pulling tool and left stuck in a thick bundle of pages."
3,Cute little tool.,"I bought this tool to go into my camera bag. I bought this item because it doesn't have a knife, and the TSA regulations, as I understand them, is that you can carry a screwdriver, pliers, or wrench under 7"" in your carry-on baggage. This tool is well under that length, as it's about 3"" long.The build quality is the typical made-in-China fare, but for the price, I don't expect it to last forever anyway. I suppose if I needed better quality, then perhaps a small Leatherman or Gerber tool with the knife blade removed might suffice."
2,Not a good design,The Nano is much smaller than the iPod holder on the Belkin pack. The suction cups still works but overall the design of this battery pack does not suit the Nano. Afterall you paid so much price for the Nano for its cute thin design. Carrying this battery pack with the Nano beats the very purpose for which you bought an expensive Nano.I am sure some other company will soon come up with a battery pack exclusively made for the Nano. I will wait and buy that rather. I returned this product within 2 days of buying it
2,Froze up my Video iPod,"I ordered this brand new and it continued to freeze up my iPod video. I ended up returning it for my money back and I ordered the Geekpod 100 battery from batterygeek.net which I read some positive reviews about in Macworld magazine. I am getting about 12 hours of video run time now with it per charge and so far I'm pretty happy. I wish I would have known about this solution sooner. Oh well, that's life I guess...."
2,Doesn't last,I was fairly happy with this product at the start except that it was way overpriced. I've had it less than a year and now there is a loose connection somewhere and I can't get any juice from it at all. Don't buy this product if you are expecting it to last more than a few months.
4,The Accidental Countess,I enjoy historical romance and this book was no exception. I ordered another book by this same author and will probably enjoy that one too.
1,Just couldn't get into this,"I really just couldn't get into this book. It was very boring and I found myself skimming a lot of the passages. The characters really didn't seem to have any chemistry and yes, I have to agree, that they didn't really have any depth. I just really couldn't care much about them."
3,Can't beat the price,The sockets work great at a great price but the finish on them is cheap. I droped one and some of the black finish came off already. I don't think they will brake easily as they have a good wieght to them but I'm going to be slightly more delicate with these then my other tools.
2,OK but not as advertised,This was advertised as the updated version but was actually the old version. When I asked the seller about the difference they said they didn't have the new version but I checked online again and they were still advertising as having the new version. Be careful.
5,A gift from USA,This item was received promptly & has made its way to Germany. It was a gift to my son's in laws. They loved it & were very pleased.
3,Warmhearted Introduction to the Potty,"In the highly populated potty book market, this book captures but one aspect: trying to get to the potty in time. Author illustrator Virginia Miller offers spare text in large easy-to-read print and drawings in pencil and colored marker featuring a lovable bear named Bartholomew (&#65533;Ba&#65533; for short). When his papa George asks, &#65533;Do you need your potty, Ba?&#65533; his son responds &#65533;Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, NAH!&#65533; My girls thought this hysterical and began repeating it (almost to the point of tedium). Read this book for entertainment only. To introduce the functional aspects of the toilet training process, such as what actually goes in the potty, wiping, flushing, and washing up, try these more instructional potty books: The Potty Book for Girls by Alyssa Satin Capucilli, You Can Go to the Potty by Dr. Sears or What To Expect When You Use the Potty by Heidi Murkoff."
3,On your Potty!,"Kindly dad George invites Bartholomew bear to sit on his potty, but Ba, in true toddler fashion, refuses. Later, though, when he's playing, the urge overtakes him and he runs to the potty in the nick of time... and, of course George congratulates him with a big bear hug. Virginia Miller's illustrations have a beutifully sure touch and the bears' facial expressions are very evocative of the powerful emotions surrounding this sometimes tricky time. ""This had lovely pictures but the message didn't get across strongly enough to encourage Florence to sit on her own potty"""
3,It Is What It Is,"Well, I have not reviewed Beatles product in some time & this remaster from the 2009 recordings is as I say ""What It Is"" which is a ""Best Of"" the singles on one CD. Don't get me wrong, I liked it but frankly it is a single CD missing important ""Double"" ""B"" sides which were included on the ""Red"" / ""Blue"" double CD's. I actually recommend them over this single CD if you have the extra bread but, if your looking for a solid CD, then this is the ticket. I wish they would have put this out with the original singles as they were released on 45rpms but well, the record companies are looking out for the consumer. Surprised there are not more complaints about the tracks that are in mono on this set, of course ""Love Me Do"" is only mono but someone will always complain if they are not familiar with The Beatles output. So if your looking for a X-Mas gift for 2011 then this might be a good bet.Stop by my website sometime and say ""Hi"" @ JudeMac Forever, Google it."
4,"Great Action, Not So Great Background Narrative","It takes over half the book to get to any action, but then it really heats up with great space ship battles. Two interesting main characters with flaws and quirks that make you want to follow them.On the whole I prefer the Lieutenant Leary series by David Drake, very similar, but Drake's world is set up in a more interesting and believable way."
1,Dread-fully boring,"Man, I couldn't even finish this book. When I was younger, I would finish books no matter how bad they were.The action is way too slow, there are really only two action scenes. The flashback story with Caro was interesting, but I figured out the twist way before it happened. I found the technology in this book really dull. It seemed like it was written in the 1950's.It was a good idea for a story, the disintegration of a galactic empire, but the author did not pull it off in an interesting way."
1,"A volume, not a novel","Other reviewers have tossed back and forth, ""It's slow"" vs. ""It's got character development."" Regardles of your tastes, you need to know that it is not at all a complete novel. It does not stand alone. It stops, in obvious mid-story, with an ineffectual attempt to set up the pick-up point for the next book. It should be labelled ""Volume 1 of x"" so that prospective buyers can tell what they are buying."
1,1 Star is way too much...,"Solomon makes very weak and irrational points in his book. One begins to believe that he just wants to make a profit off of the phenomenon that is Dilbert. I mean, people usually aren't influenced by a cartoon, a cartoon in the comics section of the newspaper. It's not worth the money to buy this book...even if it was free.I can only imagine the sequel... 'The trouble with Garfield...'. Get a life, Solomon."
1,Just too sloppy...,"Too many small errors lead me to question the author's ability to accurately relay the information in this case.His reference to ""Jessie"" May Clampett should read ""Ellie"" May Clampett.The singing artist he cites is named Annie Lennox not Annie ""Proux"". (E. Annie Proulx is a Pulitzer Prize winning author.)And, as far as his statement in the book that arranged marriages in the Hispanic community are not uncommon today, well, I can only say that as a Hispanic that has lived in Texas for over 36 years, I have NEVER heard of such a practice.The reader is left to wonder what other errors are in this sloppy book."
5,A great casserole for one-dish stove top meals....,"Brown your onion-celery-pepper mince, add your meat, add your rice or pasta and broth -- everything in one pan! A bit of cheese, and ladle of sauce, or a crust topping and, voila! A perfect meal!Dinner in one great porcelain coated cast iron pan that heats evenly and on a lower temp than most other metals, covers so snuggly that you don't loose your juices to steam,and then cleans so easily you won't believe it!The size is just right for a meal for 4 (or an empty next of 2 with enough microwaveable containers for leftovers....)And the gradient red is so gorgeous it looks like it was meant to carry to a buffet lunch or Grandma's house for Christmas dinner."
3,"A good idea, but is mine broken?","Basically, I think this product is a great idea. However, after using it, I'm not so sure it was engineered so well.First, while I've not experienced any serious buzzing or annoying degredation in audio quality, it's clear that the components used in the line out feature aren't as good as what's in the iPod. Listening at equal volumes, I notice that my headphones sound marginally better through the iPod jack than the Belkin jack.Second, I have the capability to plug headphones in ""too far."" basically, I have to pull the 1/8th inch male plug out about 1mm in order to get proper sound. It doesn't go to mono when I push it in too far, but bass and high treble frequencies get heavily attenuated. I think this might be a defect in the manufacture of my particular unit.I'm not sold that this is a great product. If you're on the fence, you may want to check out Monster Cable's similar product, even though it doesn't offer volume control from the line-out port."
4,Better audio than FM transmitter,"This device provides great audio. It does a much better job than an FM transmitter.I use this kit with a SONY cassette adapter, for my 4th Gen. iPod, and it works great. A few comments on this kit:* I get a full charge on my fully-drained iPod battery in about 1 hour.* If you plan on using a cassette adapter, then connect it to the cassette adapter plug on the kit, rather than directly on your iPod. It is a convenient way of shortening cables, and routing less cables to your iPod.* I experienced distorted music play-back when I set the kit's volume control on a high setting. I found that it's best to keep the kit volume control at a medium (or less) setting, with an iPod medium-high (or less) volume setting, and use the car's stereo for over-all volume control."
4,so far so good,"This is my 3rd car adapter in 2 years. I have a feeling that the others died a premature death because of a fuse blowout, but how to change their fuses? So, a large reason why I bought this is the replaceable fuse option. Another nice feature: I use a cassette adapter so usually I plug it into the headphone jack of the iPod but with this product you plug directly into the car adapter. My own preference, but it makes for less clutter in my center storage console where my ipod sits. And the volume control on the adapter is nice too."
1,Incompatible with Ipod Touch Rev 2 (and more),"First negative review of a product at Amazon, and it's got 3 strikes.1) Product listed as compatible with iPod touch, but my rev.2 (32gb) complains about the accessory is not permitted to charge my iPod.2) The line-out clearly has some noise in it (although it would likely have less if I turned down the amp). It's not so bad in my car that I'm ""listening to my spark plugs"", but it's clearly there. It's also a very low frequency, which bothers me more than radio hiss would.3) It's not well behaved - if you unplug the iPod it still sucks juice, so I can't just leave it plugged in somewhere (well, maybe I could, but I'm not willing to test how much it pulls vs how strong my battery is) and just use it to plug in the iPod when it's in the car with me.Overall, a frustrating buy. If I can find a 32gb old ipod that I can just have be the ""car ipod"", I may pick it up cheap, but otherwise this product will likely gather dust in the glove box for a bit."
4,Doesn't work with iPhone 3G,"This product works great for iPods and the original iPhone. But note that it won't charge the new iPhone 3G. You can play music from the 3G through the Belkin, but it won't charge. This is because, as I understand it, the 3G is the first iPod/iPhone product that will only charge via the USB lines in the Dock Connector. But the Belkin still uses the older Firewire lines for charging."
4,"Works great, but needs strain relief on connectors","I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. She uses it with the Aux input jack in her Mazda3, and it works wonderfully. We particularly like the audio output at the base of the unit--that means that only one cable has to come out of the center console to connect to her iPod. We use a 12"" cable between the Belkin charger and the Aux input, which keeps the cables to a minimum.However, after about three months of use, the connection between the cable and the plug that connects to the iPod started to come loose. There was apparently no strain relief on that section, and the individual wires became visible as the outer jacket worked its way out. About two weeks later, it stopped transmitting music.Thankfully, Belkin has a lifetime warranty (with an express replacement option)--so I just submitted the warranty information.The only reason this product did not receive 5 stars was because of the strain relief issue. Otherwise--it's terrific!"
4,We need a track list - Here it is,1. A Horse with No Name2. I Need You3. Sandman5. Ventura Highway6. Don't Cross the River7. Muskrat Love8. Tin Man9. Lonely People10. Sister Golden Hair11. Daisy Jane12. Woman Tonight
5,Buying for the second time,"I have had this album as an LP, a tape, and a CD. The CD simply wore out, and I'm buying it again. This is one of the most relaxing yet stimulating albums ever created. Amazing how it still sounds so good so many years after I first heard it."
1,Customer Service,After emailing thrustmaster 2 times we still haven't received an address to return the defective wheel.I am very disappointed in thrustmaster .WE have an online racing team and I have only had my wheel for am month.the wheel has a 2 year warranty but what is the use if they don't stand by their warranty
4,Wonderful fantasy,"While it's always a pleasure to revisit an enjoyable series it's even better to see additional episodes that were never aired on TV. Heath Ledger is excellent as Prince Conor, the scenery is lush and beautiful, and the show beautifully blends magic and action.That being said, it is fantasy and (like most series and movies of its ilk) wildly historically inaccurate. As has been mentioned before the Romans never invaded Ireland and by 400 AD their power was beginning to wane and their empire to crumble. The best way to view 'Roar' is in the guise of classic fantasy, that is a story that takes place in an alternate universe - which could also account for the disparity of the characters' accents!Overall it's fun and highly entertaining."
5,roar series,"If you ever saw the show, this is a must have item. The complete series in a great box storage set. For those who enjoy sci-fi but have never seen the series, this is a great gift. Great cinematography , interresting historical take on ireland, strong story lines and a small cast of characters."
4,Roar the Series,Excellent show. Wish that it had lasted longer than one season. Wonderful scenary of New Zealand. This is one of the first acting preformances for Health Ledger. If you love the Celtic time period you will love this series. Well worth you time.
2,Disappointed,I'm disappointed in the product because rust spots started appearing in the bottom within the first month to six weeks .
1,stains carpet and lineoleum,I used 3 of these plug ins in my house and 2 of them leaked. I now have a stain in my carpet that will not come up and a stain in my linoleum which is set in. I will have to replace both of these areas.
2,An Ending...,"Blitz Tactics has never been a serious series. Pretty much all it focuses on is fanservice (plenty of panty shots) and action (be it martial arts or gunplay). That being said, this final volume of Najica:Blitz Tactics is no different.The art is crisp, but the story is convoluted and lacking. There's a bit of a climax, a bit of resolution, but it's all so predictable. Blah.Two stars...."
3,Please see my notes on Other LSAT Materials,I tried several systems and books the Prin Rev is the best and easiest to follow.Look at my other notes on the Kaplan system. Even though I used the LSAT and purchased this for some one.EVERYONE HAS TO FIND THE ONE SYSTEM AND STICK WITH IT.Good Luck to you.
4,Lots Of Fun!,"This is the first Trivial Pursuit P.C. game I've played, and I enjoy it very much. This game includes the classic trivial pursuit, as well as the unhinged version. The first version I tried in this game is the classic. I was immediately addicted! A few days later I tried the unhinged version, and found it even more fun and addictive. The reason I give this game 4 stars instead of 5 is that at times during the unhinged game, it can be difficult to hear and understand what the ""host' is saying. Furthermore, in the unhinged game, it is not possible to play solo."
2,Very disappointing machine,"I've owned Miele kitchen appliances so I thought a Miele vacuum was a no-brainer. Adequate on rugs, carpets. Very poor function on hardwoods, tile. The exhaust from the HEPA filter blows dust and debris away from the front of the vacuum before it's able to be suctioned up. The only was to keep from chasing pet hair across the floor is to turn the motor speed to low and pull the handle down to the floor so the exhaust fan is directed off the floor. The handle is also very flexible with rotation and has split in half."
4,A Historical Treasure from a past generation,"This book is a snap shot in time from the mouths of the Marines who made the history of Guadalcanal. The author compiled the story of the legendary 212th Marine Fighter Squadron by interviewing members of the squadron on leave in California. Because many of the pilots, and the author himself, returned to fight and die in combat their accounts of battle are true history undilluted by editors and contemporary cultural bias. This is a great story of triumph over adversity. Of Marines cutting an airstrip out of the jungle while fighting off mosquitos, monsoons, malaria and the Japanese. Don't expect War and Peace; the author cuts right to the point and tells the story in a journalistic ""war correspondent"" style. But as a Marine, that's how I think the boys on Guadalcanal would have wanted their stories told. Semper Fi."
1,LOUSY !,"THis boos was written during the War, and it is full of patriotic messages. There's endless ans boring narratives about the daily dificculties facing the pilots, the ground crew, etc, etc, but almost nothing of air combat and, when it happens, the brave Americans simply smashes the dumb Japanese! Horrible!"
2,The Bum,"The hero, or should I say anti-hero (Andrew) of Steven Rinehart's ""Built in a Day"" is pretty much a creep and a wash out: he has married a seemingly nice woman( Isabel) with 2 teenage boys (Russ and Alex) yet he lusts after the 15 year old girlfriend (Jule) of one of them. He is a recovering alcoholic and has spent years trying to graduate from college and at 32, still hasn't. Rinehart does allow Andrew one redeeming quality though and that is his longing and striving to make a family of his stepsons and of course, his wife.Throughout this novel you get the nagging feeling that Rinehart's heart isn't in it: nothing much happens, he has little sympathy for his hero and in the last 5 pages Andrew gets an unwarranted comeuppance and put down.At best the prose is good but many pages go by with Andrew droning on and on making petty and minor observations. I can't help but wonder why Rinehart wrote this book and more importantly why I also chose to finish it."
2,Charlie Brown,"I think this book could be educational, but also could be confusing. The book has a stroy line but I didn't find it very interesting. I think it does however tell children that even if they think that they can't do somthing that they should go ahead and try anyway to see if they could actually do it. This book seems to use some violent words such as ""stuid"" in it which I don't think that children need to be calling other children. There is also a reference to violent children towards other children, I understand the fact that Lucy is a bully but children don't need to use violence to get their point across. I wouldn't recommand this book to be read to your children."
5,It works great!,"I have Miele vacuum and this works great.I vacuum every day since my baby drop food, make mess with tissues...etc.It holds a lot of dust and other things.I don't have to change the bag for long time, so I don't mind spending extra to get this bags."
3,Miele style FJM vacuum bags,"These bags are fine. They work well, no problems. They are more expensive than other versions simply because they have plastic rims instead of cardboard; but they fit right into the machine as stated. I paid a little more to have the exact model that the manufacturer recommends. I would buy them again."
4,Tiller Galloway at his best,If your a Tiller Galloway fan this is a must have.If you are a cavern or cave diver even more so. The descriptions Poyer uses in this cave diving thriller are awesome.I've read all the Tiller Galloway novels and I feel this one is the best.As an active diver and a North Carolina native {Tiller's homestate} I highly recommend this book.
4,Modified Rapture,"Fleming may well be an ideal interpreter of the Four Last Songs, but she is rather poorly served by the orchestra, conductor and engineers - no surprise that she is rumoured to want to record the set again. Simply in terms of vocal quality, she surpasses even Janowitz in three of the four songs: nothing can be expected to compete with the spun silver of Janowitz's Beim Schlafengehen. The tone is warmer and creamier, and the words are treated with great care, without falling into the mannered style of Schwarzkopf. However, she is miked too closely, the acoustic is slightly too enclosed, and the orchestral line is not floated with sufficient grace. Compare what Karajan does with this."
3,just ok,"My daughter (who is 5 and so didn't elaborate) said it tastes ok, but didn't finish the bar. That's saying something considering how TINY the bars are. These are about half the size of a typical SMALL snack bar. I signed up for a ""subcribe and save"" and am cancelling. Not worth the cost."
1,not pleased,"i was very disappointed by the small size, but i was shocked by the brick-like texture of a bar with chewy in the name. it tastes good, but the hard texture and small size were not what i had in mind. i called amazon with my complaint and received a full refund. thank you"
1,Very disappointed as they seemed to melt all over,"I enjoy this product and thought it was a great deal on Amazon, but was very disapppointed when it arrived. It looked like the boxes had melted. They were wet and sticky!! I am trying to find a number to complain and can't find anything."
3,Just OK,"My husband has become a critic of GF granola bars, and declares that this one is ""just OK"". Not nearly as good as their chocolate bars (but then, what could compare with anything chocolate?). We will not order these again. But bring on the chocolate variety! Price and shipping from Amazon was great, as usual."
4,Acceptable snack bars,"I love, love, love Enjoy Life foods! I have to be soy- and dairy-free, so these work for me. I do wish they were higher in protein so they could be used as portable meal-bars. I do appreciate that most varieties aren't high in sugars."
5,Great GF snack,I LOVE these and never leave the house without at least one in my bag. They are great for breakfast or an anytime snack.
5,Deserves more than 5 stars!,"Must reading! In company with various readers cited above, I bought extra copies, lent them to friends, and all were ""lost"" by my friends' wives."
5,Life Transforming!,"So I got this book on a friend's recommendation and little did I know what I was about to learn. Yeah sure, it might sound a bit misogynist to start with but we are talking about generalisations here. All our lives as men, we are trained to please women in everything we do. The job we have, the car we have, the cologne we wear and so on, this book will set you free. After reading this you will start to see the true world with full knowledge, just as Neo in the movie The Matrix. Since I finished this book, I have placed more value on myself as an individual rather than thinking about the opinion of the current female in my life. This is book is highly recommended."
2,Yet another confused female author,"I had expected to like this book because I had heard that it is anti-feminist. But in fact, it is not. Just like feminists, the author believes that men and women should be basically equal. She just has the insight to realize that men are worse off than women are in modern society. So she basically just rants against women. And while I share with the author a general disgust for modern women, I have nothing against traditional women. Just like feminists, the author is hopelessly confused by failing to understand the fundamental differences between men and women."
2,Adesso 17 LCD Tablet,"I returned this product as it was not compatible with my Intel iMac (2.1GHz) running Mac OS 10.5.5 - the current OS. The tablet software would not install on my computer. The device itself will connect, but it has only VGA output - so the screen resolution is not great. Kind of defeats the whole 17 in monitor idea."
2,Not helpful,"This is an OK story. However, it does not offer any real help for kids to deal with their anxieties, so I did not find it to be a satisfiying purchase."
5,"Kudos to Kevin Henkes, he's done it again!","Add Wemberly to the long list of Kevin Henkes' loveable characters. She worries about lots of things, but finds in the end, that her biggest worry (SCHOOL!) is nothing to worry about. Children of all ages will identify with Wemberly's knack for concern, but will enjoy experiencing the lovely way the adults in her life help her cope. Thank you Kevin Henkes, for another book about real feelings disguised in adorable entertainment."
4,Shiny coat!,My kitten has such a noticeably shinier coat after feeding her this for about a month. She's not complaining so neither am I!
4,buy this album!!!,"if there's one thing i can safely say about this record, its that its definitely something original and refreshing. a breath of fresh air for not only jazz/hiphop/instrumental afficionados, but music lovers everywhere. im really happy to have heard this, and i would recommend it to everyone. enjoy."
1,Buy the paperback,"The Kindle edition is really ugly to work with. It jumbles the formatting so the text alternates from example/insert to chapter information within the same paragraph. It also leaves out key images (""Image not included due to digital copyright restrictions""). Save yourself the hassle and buy the paperback version."
3,ehhh,"Well this one has to be the most boring out of this collection I have purchased, but that depends on if you have gone to school for advanced arts or your just starting. To the advanced its boring, to those learning it may teach you something."
4,Practical & Thorough,As a graduate student in a group dynamics class I found this book very practical and thorough. I like Yalom's interpersonal approach a lot too but I find that this book covers the nuts and bolts of groups really well.
2,Basic and obvious,"This book could have been a 10 page pamphlet. It was simplistic and boring, with very unrealistic dialogue. Not one of the people in my group counseling class a single good thing to say about it other than that it was cheaper than most of the books we have had to buy. Although every one of the other books I have bought for graduate school are staying on my shelf as references, this one is going straight up for resale."
3,A good introduction to an intriguing text,"A very readable and contemporary take on the Book of Ecclesiastes, written from a Christian perspective. Limburg sees the book and its writer in an ultimately positive light, counselling us to enjoy our God-given life even in the midst of confusion and aging. He discusses workaholism and Bonhoeffer in thoughtful ways.This is a good basic introduction to the book, the prose flows very well. No index. For a fuller, more scholarly, and very insightful read on Ecclesiastes, I recommend Jacques Ellul.Reason for Being: A Meditation on Ecclesiastes"
3,reiki book,Reiki: The Healing TouchTHe book was smaller than the book I'd seen and a poor copy of the print. It would be OK if you wanted a small version of the original. The paper was thin. Read the dav carefully when buying a book
5,GeForce 8800 GTS,"Even though it is old tech, but it's the best thing on the market if you have an old motherboard like I do, (BioStar P4M890-M7)."
1,Good Idea but worthless,I bought the can opener for my mother. She was so happy with it untill she tried to recharge it. It has not worked since. When I called to inquire about repair I was told I had only one place to mail it to and it would cost me more than a new one. Why would I ever want to spend more money on this. I thought I had bought a good gift for my mother who has a problem opening cans. I will get her a manual can opener.
1,Not worth buying,I thought this would be wonderful. I have not been able to use it successfully but once. The thing is totally useless and I feel I wasted my money on it. DO NOT BUY this! Worthless.
3,the original line-up's worst album.,"the first half of this album is terrific, but the second halfshows the original BLACK SABBATH at their worst and containssome of their most horrible songs ever with SHOCKWAVE, AIRDANCEand BREAKOUT and SWINGING THE CHAIN. the only bright spot on thesecond half is the vocal bridge on OVER TO YOU. the singing onSWINGING THE CHAIN is very un-SAB like. i don't think that BILLWARD or OZZY sing on it; i think that it's DAVE WALKER that'ssinging.the first half of the album is wonderful,however; andfeatures some great singing from OZZY. the title track is one ofthe most upbeat songs they ever did and has a wonderful guitarsolo from TONY IOMMI. the two songs that follow are also top-notch SABBATH tunes,even if the song titles and lyrics are nottypical for SABBATH.if you buy this, buy it on LP form so you don't have tolisten to side two."
4,Why the hate?,"This is an awesome album. Sure, it's nothing like the first 4 albums, but it's on par with ""Sabbath, Bloddy Sabbath"". In fact, I think I like it better than ""SBS"" because Don Airey's keyboards are way better than the synths used on ""SBS"". The title track off this album is awesome."
2,FOR DIE-HARD FANS ONLY,"At first, you probably won't care for this album, thinking it's just another Technical Ecstacy. But if you give it a chance, you'll find that some of the songs are actually pretty good. ""Junior's Eyes"" and ""Air Dance"" are the album's best tracks, but ""Never Say Die,"" ""Johnny Blade,"" and ""Swinging the Chain"" are decent, too. However, this album is far from their best and I can't really recommend it to the average listener. --Brian J. Albert"
1,A disaster of a program,"This software is practically unusable because it is so slow, even on a 2.8 Ghz machine. I mean selecting an object and dragging it is a slow-motion process. Beyond that, they include only three menu backgrounds and charge you for more. The program is filled with bugs. Note that this is in no way related to Sonic MyDVD. The Roxio company apparently bought the name ""MyDVD"" and used it on this junkware. Oh, it is HUGE. It installs over 6 other programs that you didn't even know you were buying. Save your money and time, DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
1,"too slow, too slowwwwwwwwwwww, too quirky","Takes forever to make a DVD. Crashes frequently or restarts at the beginning of the process for some unknown reason(s). And then, if it ever finishes, the DVD may be unusable."
1,This product sucks and is NOT as advertised,"The main reason we bought this was so we could put our .mov movies (from Kodak Zi8 - who's software, by the way, also doesn't work - arcsoft media impression) on dvd. THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT CONVERT .MOV FILES PROPERLY - it takes the video, but not the sound....so I get a fun looking DVD (with fun menus, etc.) for a bunch of movies without sound. Shame on ROXIO and shame on KODAK."
4,"Great, but missing what i wanted...","namely ""wild youth."" i don't which version i had when i was a high school kid, but it had wild youth/wild dub, your generation, and ""give me some truth""miss 'em and think it makes it an inferior album. at least it was mastered at the correct speed, instead of the 80's cd release, which had everything slowed down to molasses (featured in it's awful anti-glory at the end of the movie ""slc punk"""
4,Handy little book.,This book is full of great ideas that you can do at home. It also inspires you to be creative...
1,A How To book needs photos!,"I was very disappointed in this book. For $16.95, I thought it would be a great resource on making toys for my cockatiel and lovebirds. However, there are no photographs of what the toys and play areas are supposed to look like when you are done. So if the directions aren't totally clear (which I found they are not), you can't even try to figure it out since there is no reference. I'll be selling my copy as this book is useless to me."
3,he was close but he never made it,"I belive the book has a very good begining, full of expecience an even funny details, such as the author's first work on the TV industrí. But at the end, the book really falls behind my expectations. The author lacks of metodological support in some of his writing. His chappter on Documentary simply [stinks].I'll really sugest this book as a ligth reading, good for beginers, as long as you don't belive everything you read."
3,Bottle was half full,I received the item in good time but the box it came in was crushed and the bottle was only half full. It seemd like some of the contents may have been lost at some point or someone had been using it and I got the left overs. Won't order from that site again. I feel ripped off!
1,not what I thought,I thought the presentation was a little bigger and not a sign that says on the label also lower Product not for sale
3,Boston Terrier Pet Video,"Good introduction for anyone considering getting a Boston Terrior. The background ""music"" in the video is obnoxious and dis-tracting. HP Dallas"
2,Too Small,"This is smaller than the wheeled 22"" kipling. The 2 external pockets are counted in the length, but the body of the piece is too small for much of anything."
5,Love to squeeze these suckers!,"This toy is a nice little stress reliever when you're bored. I guess you could even call it a hand-exerciser!Just like the pictures, when you squeeze the body his ears and eyes bug out slightly and his head swells.Overall a nice little novelty toy."
3,Bob is OK...,"I ordered this as a desk novelty. It arrived quickly. The product was in great shape, however when I pulled it out of the box, I found it is made out of thin latex and feels a bit flimsy, not to mention the stickiness of the latex (it feels like it is covered in maple syrup). Overall it is an OK reproduction of a classic toy."
5,Good Read!,I have read many of Lora leigh's books and I did enjoy this book. I do have to say my favorite series so far was the Feline series but I have enjoyed each and everyone of them for different reasons. I hope she keeps her books coming.
2,BEWARE . . . .,"i really enjoyed this author's breed series, so i thought i would branch out and start reading her other stories. boy was i surprised . . .and disgusted. when i read the back cover to get the synopsis, it gave no hint of the near incest and sharing of sexual partners that this book is all about. what an absolute turnoff! no matter how this author attempts to explain it away or justify it, it just doesn't fly. the men of this novel of warped and need some serious psychological help.the only thing of merit i found about this book was the mystery of the killer stalking this family. that was interesting, but overall can't save the novel from the filth on which it is based."
2,Um...yeah...NO,"I love Lora Leigh's books first off but holy hell this series is just ew. No means no...hell no means no. No in any language means no but the characters in this book brow beat the girl into submission. Ew. Also the whole brother rapes brother thing skeeved me out and the we need to have sex with the same woman ALL TOGETHER...is crap. It is the utter male fantasy written by a woman. If they werent related, if they didnt have such a icky past or use that crap of an excuse on why the share the same women I might have enjoyed it. But yeah this book was just nasty and not in the good way. I love smut as much as thenext girl but this was incestuous and left me feeling dirty afterwards again not in a good way. So I strongly suggest you skip reading this series....but please read Lora's Breed series or Nauti Series. Steer clear of the incest fest that is The August Men 1-3."
2,Couldn't even finish it,"Ok, I like erotica (or romantica, I think is what the romance genre is calling it these days) as much as the next woman and the erotica is the only reason this gets 2 stars. I was so distracted by the ridiculous storyline that I couldn't even finish this book. I don't know what Lora Leigh got this madness. The plot is simply beyond ridiculous. I tend to read books out of order so this was the first I'd read in the Men of August series. I won't bother with the other two."
4,Encouraging,"This book is truly a testimony of God and how prayer is a way to meet with Him. It shows how prayer provides a way to get close enough to Him to touch His cloak. This book is not for someone who is wanting to know how to start a 24-7 prayer room, although there are ideas that are talked about throughout the book, and about how some were started. I was greatly encouraged while reading this book and it reminded me that God is big and loving; not always safe... but good."
1,It does nothing for me,"I am currently reading this book for a bible group and it seems that the majority of people are excited about it, but I have to be honest, it does not excite me at all. It's a good read, but doesn't get me excited about a prayer room.I don't think that we need a prayer room to meet God and that many people, after reading this book, feel that a prayer room is the ony true way to find the essence of God. It is not.I am a Christian, but am not moved by this book as other people are. I didn't cry, I just read and even got a little bored in some chapters.Kudos to those who love this book. I am not afraid to say this it isn't that great."
5,Careful with this one!!,"I have trouble reading books all the way through. This one was difficult to put down. True story of normal everyday men and woman placing their bets on an extroardinary God. Pete Greig's recount of the journey of a post modern prayer movement from pre-pre-conception, to preconception, to conception, to birth and infancy is well documented if a bit confusing. I am reading it a second time to get the facts straight. Careful!! This book could give you the incentive you need to risk spending an hour with the Creator of the Universe."
5,A great value for the price!,"I was a bit wary of buying this after reading some of the reviews, but I'm thrilled with this toaster. I haven't had any of the uneven toasting problems that others seemed to have had. I love that I can toast even the thickest waffles and bagels in the super-wide slots. The controls are easy to use and the product heats up and toasts fast. To get such a good brand name at this price is a steal, and I'm very satisfied."
1,PIECE OF SH*T,"Well I ordered this for my girlfriend for one of her Xmas gifts. I received it today. I took it out of the box and noticed several scratches and obvious food stuck in various places on the outside. Nothing a damned towel couldn't clean off for christ sake. How difficult would it have been for them to clean the damn thing before shipping? I plugged it in and immediately realized it was broken before it was even shipped. The plunger handle used to lower toast would not stay down, and it made this constant clicking sound when held and the lights kept flashing on it. I put bread in it and tried it again. Still the same thing. So I printed out a UPS label and I am returning this piece of [...]"
5,Great Seller!!,"This sale was a great deal. I got a high quality, premium brand, as well as free shipping. Thanks for the great shopping experience."
1,Save your money for Vegas.,"Two old sayings come to mind....""If the deal looks too good to be true, it probably is."" and ""You get what you paid for."" I though REFURBISHED ment not working before but working now. I was wrong. The one I got looks like new. I thought ""What a great deal!"" Then I plugged it in. The only way it works is to hold down the handle till I think the toast is done. The control panel never lights up...the handle won't stay down.PROS..Looks great on your kitchen counter. Your friends will be impressed!CONS..Doesn't work. Hopefully you friends won't ask to see it in action."
1,Toaster that is not reconditioned and does not toast,"I purchased this item believing that it had indeed been reconditioned and that it would indeed make toast. It had not been reconditioned, and 1/2 of the burners did not work. Hence, it made 1/2 toast, which is not even 1/2 good. I resent the waste of my time that this transaction created and will never, under any condition, buy another Cuisinart product, nor any other not-reconditioned item via Amazon."
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK!!!!,Worked great for about 6months. Then one day the remote button just stopped working. It was used in doors and never saw the light of day or any weather. I changed all the batteries and looked over all the components and I couldnt find anything that stuck out other than I must have gotten a defective remote :( really makes me upset cause I really liked the fact that I could be used on flash mode only of bell only or flash with bell. Also its sensitive to any loud bangs or vacuums being used near it. The high EMFs set off the strobe very easy. radio controlled bells can be very sensitive sometimes. Wish I could have gave it a better review but I cant because it broke and It was barely used.
4,No Complaints,Our doorbell recently died and rather than having a new one rewired I purchased this to try. I have been very happy with the results. The range is great and the sound is extremely loud...you certainly won't miss anyone!! The flashing indicator is a great addition as well.
3,Sunnybell ST60 product review,"This wireless door bell worked fine upon battery installation. However, the pushbutton cover does not snap closed to hold the front and back halves of the unit together. I had to use a patch of duct tape to hold the front half to the back after mounting the back to the frame by the door. Additionally, the button uses an unusual 12 volt battery that is not available everywhere and finding a replacement may take some effort. The Bell unit has a single slot to hang on a wood screw (provided) but once the 3 standard ""C"" batteries are installed, the balance is off and the wall unit hangs at an angle. Thus far I have given this product a 3-star rating but that might upgrade to 4-stars if the batteries last for four to six months."
4,Works As Advertised,"I bought this unit because my car stereo has an AUX port, but the sound quality from my plugged-in media device was too low to be able to listen to without distortion from having to turn up the volume too high on both to hear well. A world of difference this unit makes. The unit does a great job of boosting the sound from my media player, enabling me to comfortably listen in my car without distortion or sound loss. It did take a few minutes to discover the right media player volume setting to maximize sound quality output and balance it with the car stereo's volume for meaningful volume adjustment. I only have one very minor issue with the unit. The unit is ""On"" whenever a stereo plug is inserted into the top ""in"" port, not whenever a media player is attached. As the unit sits in my car, the extra step of disconnecting the cable from both the media player and the Boostaroo is needed or else the batteries drain overnight. All in all, a perfect solution to my car audio problem."
5,STILL GOOD!!!...Ashford & Simpson at their absolute best!!!,If I could give this release 100 stars I would without blinking!!! Every cut from start to finish is a masterpiece....absolutely no throw-a-ways on this one. A complete album that you'll find yourself playing over and over again. The bonus cuts are great too!!!
5,A father helps his sons become men.,"The book is basically the account of a camping trip this author took with his oldest son. During the trip, they discuss anything regarding becoming a man. Each has prepared a list of topics. It wasn't just about the bird & bees either. I wish I had a similiar opportunity growing up, and plan to offer something like it to my son. A very enjoyable, insightful read."
3,You Might Want Something Else,"Industry Giant is a game where you have to build factories and stores and take over your opponents industry. The bad part about this game is that it's so expensive to buy factories,buildings,and terminals. So if you desprately needed to build something you would have to take out a loan or two. If your just starting to do games like this selection I sugjest you should buy games like Roller Coaster Tycoon or Sim Theme Park. Those two games are good for starters. If your experienced or a bussneiss man maybe you'd like it. So buy it!"
2,Pretty but too small for an adult,This product looks beautiful but it is TINY! It is definitely too small for an adult and too fragile for a child.
3,Cute but much smaller than it looks,"I definitely like this necklace and am happy with the purchase. Like a few people have already commented, it is much smaller than you would think by looking at the photo. It almost looks like the type of necklace a store would sell for children. You know, like in a department store, in the jewelry section, they usually have a display of necklaces for kids. well, that's what it is like. I still think it's cute though, just be forwarned about the size."
4,The title is an understatement,"Without a doubt, this is the most heart-wrenching, heartbreaking book I have ever read. The pain and sorrow--beyond sorrow!--related in the tale made me want to grab the author and shake him while screaming ""Why why why?"" in his face. Yet I read it to the end, and the end was satisfying. However, I don't think I am likely to read it again. I'm too soft-hearted for it! The synopsis on the back of the book (related above as ""book description"") is, I think, a bit misleading."
2,Good Sound Bad Fit,I bought these to replace my iPod headphones. The sound is good but the comfort is amazingly horrid. Anyway i fit these in they either fall out or hurt my ear. I'll be looking elsewhere.
2,Disappointing - 1 minute cranking last at most 1 minute of light,Crank it for a minute or two and all you get is about one minute of light. Disappointing. Maybe another brand is better...
4,Bad Packing,This set is very good except for the fact that I cannot use all of my stemware because it was broken in shipping. They packed the box using paper instead of the little air pillows which would have helped in the box when shipping. They should probably use these to ship anyone else's GLASSWARE!!!!!
1,Total crap boots!,"I thought I was going to save a few bucks and buy my next Combat Boots from Amazon to get the cheapest price. The seller was totally fine, however the boots were total crap. The leather was unbelievably stiff and hard, so I thought I would just use a ton of leather conditioner... about 15 applications and I don't think it made a difference. I put the boots on to try and ""break them in"" - lost cause there, but in addition, nearly half the eyelets came right out of the lether, first or second time trying the boots on. I would have returned the, except I had shined and polished, and oiled the boots so much. Don't buy, stick with Altama or another Military Issue brand boot. I am sticking with my Altama pair I have had for 7 years!"
2,Nasty,"I bought this popcorn a few months ago off of Amazon and decided to come back here and leave a review to warn people that like cheese popcorn not to buy this. I was a big fan of the Orville Redenbacher Pour Over Cheddar popcorn but since that has been discontinued, I figured I would try this Jolly Time cheese popcorn. Big mistake, it is nothing like the discontinued Redenbacher kind. There is not even a good cheese flavor, it's just horrible. The bad thing is when you buy this you get 36 bags of popcorn, so if you don't like it you're stuck with a ton of bags.If you really want to try this stuff, I would suggest buying a small box from a grocery store to try it first, and then if you like it, come back on here and buy this lot of 36 bags.I give this popcorn 2 stars out of 5 since it's at least edible.....barely."
3,Too spideree,"The rig is just a little too much. Too long, to thin, and too cumbersome. It does not fold up to pack well. This is troublesome, especially if you are flying with it."
4,Adequate but not great,"My new truck has an aux audio port. Hooking up my MP3 player to it was easy. But the volume was poor. So I thought I would look around to see if there were any amplifiers that could help. After looking at several I chose the T613-bnc. It improved things but I was still running volumes on my player and truck at or near max.Then I notice the little device I had used in rental cars without CD or tape players. It plays through the cars radio. This hooked to the MP3 player was better yet but I still had the player on max volume. I inserted the Boostaroo(r) and it brought things to where the were on my old truck with the cassette adapter.A bit of a cumbersome setup, but it does the job. I am still looking for a simpler setup. But this will do. In my search I here that it is a common problem with low volume from vehicle aux jacks. I wonder why."
3,USE CAUTION AND COMMON SENSE,"The suggestion to use this device to boost volume to overcome loud ambient noise is a sure route to hearing damage. Seek headphones which isolate noise (iem's, closed/sealed headphones, active noise cancelling, etc) in order to hear your music in loud environments.Headphone amps certainly have their place; some headphones are hard to drive, or simply improve in sound quality with more power. But to use this device simply to increase volume in a loud environment, as the product description states, is sheer folly. It's not just stupid; that product description has some serious liability issues.I should say that I do not own this device, and have not heard it. I therefore cannot comment on its performance as an amp; hence the 3-star rating. I simply felt compelled to comment by the irresponsibility of the product description."
5,Does Exactly What I Needed It For,"It did exactly what I needed it to do. The next thing I need in addition to this is something that controls the balance and quality of the sound coming out, because if you boost the sound at too high of a volume, it begins to distort a little."
4,I am glad my plan worked to boost company vehicle sound,"I am a new truck driver and their factory stereos have an auxiliary input so I am able to listen to my 500 songs from my portable player. The factory stereo lacks any power so a lot of songs were too quiet or distorted at low volumes. The Boostaroo not only boosted the sound but made it sound better. I would have paid more money though if it used a small lithium battery that is rechargeable instead of the two double AAs which weigh a lot. I also wished that the sound could still be played when the unit is off. If the switch is off, there is no sound at all. I also plan on getting an extension cord so that I can move this heavy unit to another part of my vehicle and only use the wire to connect to my player. However I bought it for the boosting capability and it does that so I am happy with the purchase."
5,"Yes, it works well","Yes, this product has provided great toast for over six months now. No complaints. Past the toast and jam please."
4,Good for the money,"I can't imagine paying full price for this toaster. It's a good toaster, but I don't think worth more than the re-furbished price. You really have to watch the toasting dial. If I put it on more than 1.5, it just about torches the bread. I've not gone over 2, even with thick slices or a bagel! I do like the defrost and reheat features. They really save this toaster."
5,I didn't know I could love a toaster,"This is an incredible buy. A barbain price on a terrific product that looks brand new. Toasts evenly and quickly; looks great on the counter; toasting slots are roomy enough for just about anything. I'm completely sold on ""factory reconditioned."""
1,WTHeck is this?,This is not music. This is a 4 year old plucking strings at random on a harp. Sounds like a horror movie soundtrack.
1,"The Music Fumbles, The Words Mumble, & The Message is Jumbled!","I was very disappointed with this CD.The lyrics seemed to be written in a hurry.The music overwhelmed Nicole's voice and was actually annoying at times.Simply put: This is one of those Christian CD's that is unremarkable in every way, and will be in the bargain bin in a matter of months. Don't waste your money.Skip this one if you are looking for deep spiritual lyrics, passionate vocals, and stirring music."
2,Not worth buying,"I love the song, Brave, every time I hear it on the radio, but after sampling all the other songs it isn't an album worth buying. It's also the only song you hear on the radio--for obvious reasons. It's pretty much the same saga with all of her albums. Her previous album had about 3 or 4 songs that I could listen to, but I mainly bought it because of the song Holy. Soon I hope to get an MP3 player, so I will be downloading Brave. Maybe next time Nichole Nordeman will seek to make a better album with more likeable songs."
2,Disappointed,I absolutely love Nichole's previous 3 albums and give them my highest rating so I was expecting the same with this. Unfortunately I find that I can't say that with this album. Only the first 2 songs have any merrit but they would be lower tier on any of the other albums. Very disappointed.
1,rip off!,Complete and utter rip off. I thought these puppets actually could move their lips and stuff but no! They're worse quality than a mcdonald's happy meal.
5,Inspirational,This book gives a good overview of Ste. Faustina's life. It puts her visions of Jesus into the context of her life which is sometimes obscured by reading her diary. Highly recommended .
2,Poor Quality,I ordered this as a gift and had to return it. The silver was poor quality and had markings on it that I could not remove.
1,A horror film???,"This was an embarrassment to the horror film industry. I completely understand that ""After Dark Originals"" are ""a new brand of fear"", but this one is an old brand of junk. I had a hard time keeping my eyes open, but when I realized I should give it a chance, I found myself laughing at some of the so-called gore scenes. The cranberry juice they must have used as blood, looked more like an aged Cabernet or Merlot. The banshee makeup looked like it was make of Play Dough. This is really bad. I couldn't find an actor/actress in the flick. Don't waste your time or money. Let the banshee scream. Save yourself the screams of disappointment."
3,Could of been better,If your like the poster before and are a redneck then dont buy this. Theres many worse dvds out there.And no he doesnt win in 13 secs
2,You can do better,"This stuff is mostly corn and grain filler that's not good for cats. But at least the first ingredient is chicken, although there are meat by-products also. There are much healthier choices like Innova EVO, Felidae, Natural Balance, etc."

4,Anchors Aweigh With Lemmon and Matthau,"On the surface this is nothing more than an extended episode of ""Love Boat"". Its the presence of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau that gives the film gravitas. These guys have an indelible comic chemistry that is transcendant. They could read the phonebook and make it amusing. ""Out to Sea"" is a breezy film that defies criticism. The boys are abetted by old pros like Gloria DeHaven, Donald O'Connor, Hal Linden, and Elaine Stritch as well as Brent Spiner whose snarky cruise director is light years away from his emotionless Data. Dyan Cannon is absolutely age defying or possibly she bribed the film's make-up artist. Perfect onboard or inflight viewing. Just save me a place at the buffet table. And will somebody please release ""Buddy,Buddy"" domestically. This is Lemmon and Matthau's last collaboration with Billy Wilder and it's only available on Region 2."
5,hillarious,"Jack Lemon and Walter Matthua team up again, to make this comedy hit of two best friends that find them self's aboard big trouble when Walter Matthua's character tricks Jack Lemons character to go out to sea. this movie is hilarious. i enjoyed it a lot and i hope you will to. I Recommend it for everyone"
2,what can i say,i thought except for a very selective few moments this was very boring. there were a couple of funny parts and that's why i gave it a two star. NOT SUITABLE FOR CHLIDREN!
4,Entertaining movie,"So what if this movie is a rehash, what movie isn't a rehash of another. But what makes this film worth the while. Is the paring of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. While the story is simple, they go on a crusie and pretend to be dance hosts and fall in love. But it is matthau and lemmon make this film shine. Along with some great supproting performances Brent Spiner, Donald O'Connor,Rue Mchlanahan, Dyan Cannon and Elaine Stritch delievers some the of the best lines in this film. This is worth the buy."
5,The Kings of Comedy strike again,"Whenever Matthau and Lemmon are together, you can bet they will have you in the aisles laughing as they do in Out to Sea. The plot is cute and very cleverly cast. I believe my favorite part is when Mr. Lemmon is trying to teach Mr. Matthau how to dance. The moves that Matthau trys to make is just hilarious. This is by far the best these two have been. I wish they would make another movie together!"
4,"Informative and clear, though a bit dry in places","This video covered many important safety issues that a babysitter should think about. It presents potential emergencies that a babysitter might face and discussed how the sitter should handle them. It covered these topics in a clear fashion. The video would, however, have benefitted from more dramatizations of the situations that are discussed. A large part of the video consists of a man lecturing to a group of teenagers. This lecture drags on a bit in parts - leading the viewer's attention to wander. However, sum total, this is a good video that I would recommend. I plan to have my babysitters watch it."
1,Save your money,Transmitter is too weak. Transmission can be easily overcome by transmitters in vehicles passing by.Ugly long antenna line.Went out and bought a Griffin transmitter which has much more power.
2,This recording is a bity dry...poor conducting,"I don't see why anyone would settle for this recording. Not only is the sound quality bad(it's stereo but sounds like mono), the interpretation is also dry. Not even the overture was done right. The singers are good, though I don't feel other's enthusiasm for the Figaro here. You may want to try the recordings on Decca."
4,works good,"been using this stuff for about year seems to help my cat, he's been having some urinary problems for awhile"
2,This is a great book...,This is a great book if you have the right teacher. The book is very informative yet if you have no back ground in abnormal psych you might want to make sure the teacher for your course is capable of explaining it to you. I also recomend that you make sure your copy has a CD rom. The study guide and website are great tools too. They help a lot.
1,False advertising,This isn't a DSL modem. It's an ADSL modem. Won't work on regular DSL connections.
5,Classic score! A superior effort!,"One of David Arnold's first movie scores and a totally overachieving effort. One of the first score's that I ever listened too, ID4 represents a high quality effort that I do not think Arnold has ever reached again. From his themes representing the heroics of Will Smith and Bill Pullman to his more electronic feel for the aliens, ID4 is an all around masterpiece. His excellent and patriotic themes are very powerful. While he is better known for his James bond scores, Arnold's first successful score deals with annihilation, death, destruction and finally worldwide victory. This is among the best scores written in 1990's. Although outmatched by scores such as Lord of the Rings etc, Arnold's ID4 score still great and highly recommended."
5,Totaly Awsome,I never new that it could be so easy to use an electric opener. And easy as ever to sharpen Knives. And it looks awsome in my kitchen.
3,Proter-Silex Power Opener Extra Tall,I purchased this from Amazon after my manual can opener quit functioning. It is an excellent product. The only drawback is that it is extremely noisy but does a good job at opening any size can.
1,Lousy product.,Product did not work. I sent it back to company. It coast me $9.20 to send it back. Have not heard from company or Amazon. Where is my refund? Please email me immediately.
3,Opens cans easily but cutting attachement comes off easily,"After being frustrated with our old can opener not opening cans easily, we decided to buy a new one. We bought the Proctor Silex can opener, and have been very pleased with how easy it opens up most cans on the first attempt (our old can opener usually took 3-5 tries to get it to start cutting). One thing I don't like about this can opener is that the cutting attachment comes off too easily. It pops off almost every time I finish cutting open a can. It is easy to put back into its slot, but it is frustrating how easy it is to get it off. I really wish they would redesign how the cutting attachement locks into place, as if that was fixed, this would be a great can opener."
5,Addictive,"This CD is addictive: I cannot take it out of my CD player. I purchased the album because I love Susan's voice, and I knew none of the songs beyond ""Both Sides Now."" The performances are wonderful, and I think Christopher McGovern's arrangements compliment her quite well and add a lot of beauty on their own. As for the songs I didn't know, I cannot get 'Oh, How I Loved You"" out of my head."
3,ok for older kids,"The songs included are too advanced for the suggested 3 and up age category. I bought it for my 4 yr old neice and she liked it, but it was difficult to sing along with the tapes. A few not so good things about this toy are: there is no power off switch you have to unplug the microphones or have the tape autostop to turn it off-it takes 4 C batteries which can be expensive if the toy is used too often; You are better off buying an AC adpater; Finally, the headset is difficult to figure out how to use."
2,Karaoke machine not a karaoke machine,"I purchased this item, at full price, for my 6 year old granddaughter. It was on her wish list. We were all very disappointed Christmas morning when we read inside the packaging that the unit needed another unit to actually play the tapes included in the original unit. Thus, no one, including my 6 year old granddaughter could use the unit as a Karaoke machine and could only record our own chatter. Very disappointing, to say the least. I would not have purchased it had I known it was not complete."
2,"Broken, hardly used",I bought this for my daughter last Christmas. Guess what? I'm looking for a new one this year too. The button to press for play won't stay down so it is useless. Didn't even last til Easter. Maybe other's have better luck. Also Karaoke is hard to find on cassette. Better to invest in a cd or better yet a DVD one. Which I'm looking to buy...
1,waste of time,"Attention to all parents. dont buy this toy! My 6 year old got one for winning a scholarship for singing, 150$, and she wanted to sing even more. when she started singing on this thing, there was a loud noise and it almost broke. you have to put your lips on the mike to get a tiny scratchy sound. I recommend that you use your money on another kind of karaoke system. Even a 10$ one is better."
1,Worst Customer Support Ever!,If they let me give ZERO stars I would. I bought this unit 8 months ago and it worked for a total of about two days. I have returned it three times (at $20 shipping each time) and SVAT's customer service is less than useless. I will never buy another SVAT product.
1,Not a good spyglass.,"I purchased this spyglass from another vendor; it's going straight back. The field of view is tiny, and it can only focus on objects quite far away-- nothing within the same room. It is difficult to focus even on distant objects; my 4-year-old will not be able to use it. Disappointing. Save yourself the hassle of having to ship it back and choose a better-rated spyglass."
4,The product is Great but.....,The product is good and well designed. The only issue I have is that the provided instruction was not good enough to guide fixing by yourself.
