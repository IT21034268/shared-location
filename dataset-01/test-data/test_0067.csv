1,Why do I keep on reading this?,"Is what I wonder each time I pick this book up. I consider myself a very caring person but I haven't conjured up anything but pure disgust at this Williamson. Mental illness is very scary and disturbing to me and I think it can't really be helped all that much and it ticks me off that they quit taking their meds and go off the deep end. What purpose did he serve here? I looked at the pics and saw he was wasted away to nearly nothing so went searching to see what finally put him out of his and everyone else's misery. That was the high point of the book and I may not have to finish it now. Yes, it sucks that he was not guilty but he was crazier than an outhouse rat!"
3,John should stick to novels,"This was not what I am used to from Grisham. I know fiction and non fiction are different, but I always enjoy Johns' novels this was a long dragged out story, that I would have put down after about a quarter of the book except I always finish a book after I start it. I can appreciate all the research and work that went into it, but if he ever writes another true story, I will not buy it..."
2,Too much information,I enjoyed the first half of the book. I found it interesting that it was a true story unlike the rest of his books. I also used to be a counselor so I thought the mental illness aspect was interesting. His writing style (similar to a reporter) was also different but I enjoyed the change. What I didn't like was there was way too many details and information. I ended up skimming through the last half of the book.
4,Interesting and an eye opener,"I feel that Mr. Grisham did an excellent job telling this story of Ron Williamson, and others in sad, but similar situations. Ron's sisters are saints and I felt for them just as much as him. They also went through a great ordeal. The reason for the 4 stars is there were times I wanted to hurriedly get past some of the repeated legal details, but I can see where it tied the whole story together nicely and I found myself unable to put it down. Great job for John Grisham's first non-fiction and may we all hope and pray that this story will serve to make those in the justice system remember how important it is to do their jobs with the utmost care and thoroughness - for both parties involved."
3,It's ok,"This book definitely has not kept my attention like Grisham's other books. It has taken me twice as long to read and I still haven't finished it! Grisham, not at his best."
4,Disturbing,"Some Grisham fans may not enjoy non-fiction. At times the story gets a little tedious and bogged down. Overall I found the story compelling and disturbing. A one time all-star ball player becomes a miserable wreck of a person. He is suffering from mental illness and alcoholism and is targeted by local law enforcement for a murder he did not commit. His friend, who is a high school science teacher, was merely guilty by association. It is reprehensible that so many people in the criminal justice system dishonored the constitution. Their conduct was egregious. Fact is stranger than fiction. This was a great story that needed to be told and John Grisham tells the story in a passionate manner."
5,innocence ignored,"I found it unbelievable that such a travesty of justice could be carried out, with even basic steps of investigation being ignored"
3,The innocent Man,"Good book and presentation but as I did not yet read it, I can tell you a properly opinion right now."
1,Negative Stars?,"So disappointing. I expected a book, not a collection of facts written in some random stream of consciousness attempt. This is the worst book I have read ever. I kept thinking it would get better but it never did. Talked to folks on planes reading it and they had the same reaction. Not worth it even if someone gives it to you. Don't waste your time. I hear Playing for Pizza is almost as bad. What happened to Grisham? He has been my favorite author for years. So sad."
2,Not Up To Par,"I'm a Grisham fan that's read virtually everything he's ever written, but this one isn't very good-- kind of a dull recitation of court proceedings, and confusing bounce-backs in the time line. I think this must be something he wrote years ago, couldn't get published,and now that he's famous has brought it out."
2,Tried twice and could not finish,"The subject of the book is compelling and important. Loving many of John Grisham books in the past, I expected to to love this book based on the summary and the author. However, I have not been able to finish the book on two attempts. It read like a newspaper article more than a novel,and when another book turned up I was eager to switch to it without forcing myself to finish this one."
2,Buy the Somethin' Stupid Single Instead,"The somethin' stupid single has my way as well. It's not the video but it's the song, and it has the sometin' stupid video. Let love be your energy is an excellent song but I wouldn't reccommend this single. Mr. Bojangles or Somethin' Stupid would be a better Swing When You're Winning single to buy. A good Sing When You're Winning single would be Eternity or Rock Dj."
4,Different Sound,"This release from 2 Live Crew is a lot different from their earlier CD's. The songs still have all the typical 2 Live lyrics yet their beats tend to be more dance related. Something everyone, men and women can shake their @sses to. Definitely worth the listen."
5,sturdy and holds a lot,"This really solved our storage problems. We bought 2 and are buying 2 more. It holds so much. We are using 2 in kids rooms. We will buy 2 more for off season storage. It is so great to have breathing room in our closets. The covers a great for a garage, but I made different covers for the bed rooms because the gray is just too Blah. We bought it on Amazon for 59.99 with super saver shipping. What a fantastic deal delivered to your door!!!!!! check carefully to be sure you get the lowest price, but you might have to wait for shipping at a later date."
4,First Authentic Spiritual Biography of Modern Western Man,"Well, that's how Joe Campbell describes it, anyway. And, for those who find the language and style one finds in literature like this tolerable, Parzival is rich in symbolism, peppered by it's author's private concerns, and has a convincing account of battle here and there (Von Eschenbach was himself a tried knight at the open of the 13th century-- in fact he not-very-credibly claims to be illiterate.) If you managed Mallory, you owe it to yourself to read something with a little more depth."
1,"Outdated, lacks professional credibility, hurts children's lives","Length:: 5:58 MinsIn this video, I discuss my concerns about this book. I compare Phillip Goldstein to Barry Goldstein, I compare Phillip Goldstein to Richard Gardner and (assuming this is currently being backed by Yale) I invite the author/publisher to an exchange of information. Thank you for watching."
4,A fine Nena collection,"This disc comes in for some criticism on Nena's website. It seems there have been a series of Nena collections, this being an exact, or near exact duplicate of a previous release. ""Completely superfluous"" is how I would translate it from the German. Sony was mocked for its ""quality product"" sticker on the front of the jewel case. But I felt that was too harsh. I was glad to get this disc and have been enjoying it. It has some fine work by Nena on it. I'm afraid to go farther than that and only give four stars out of deference to those Nena fans who are more knowledgeable. I liked the disc. I think others would too. I would list the song titles, but if you are a Nena fan you've probably already got all the songs on this disc. So I would say get it if you don't have a lot of Nena's previous releases."
3,Not bad..but the back is stupid!!,"Would have been better had they just remade the ''touring in the abyss'' eagle shirt, but still this is woth it if you get it for cheap$$At least Slayer acknowldge their past to some degree, REMEMBER Slayer was amazing once upon a time!!"
1,Didn't get this,I didn't get this. I can't rate something that i didn't get. Sounds like something i would have liked though.
2,"Great movies, but fire your copy editor...","Although John Stanley's book covers a lot of great movies, there are many problems with the overall context. For example, he seems to only have a vague recollection of a lot of the movies. Because, a lot of reviews get the stories completely wrong. (HELP's plot is not about the Beatles looking for Ringo's magic ring. Everybody knows that!)Some actors are credited with the wrong roles. Also, there are many glaring spelling errors and a slight continuity problem: A title will say ""see altertnate title"", and that title and review would not be in the book! Mr. Stanley, do a little more research on your films and a more careful job of copy editing and you'll have an invaluable book. The more I read your current volume, the more mistakes I find and the more I feel I could write a better book myself."
3,Beautiful Color,"This color is awesome but as others have stated, you need more dye than normal to pentrate whatever you are dying. I dyed one pair of pants (I'm a size 3 juniors) and used two packs of dye. By the way...I got the same dye at my local Joanne Fabrics store for less than 3 bucks a piece. It's way more expensive on Amazon. I guess it's because they have to inlcude shipping cost to items which state free shipping."
3,Definitely not medittational,The first song is very soothing. But there are some irritating caughing heard in the background sometimes. 2nd song definitely do not fall under meditational category.
4,Only for the hard core fan.,"This CD is only for those who have remember DJ Frankie Bones from back in the day. Not a bad CD, but not his best work."
1,Used Book Order,"I received my book , and it was not at all in the condition described. I like the book itself, but the condition was poor. The paper jacket was pretty bad, and the book binding was coming apart in several places. I would not buy from this seller again, but am keeping the book because of the hassles of return. L.C."
3,Wow! 5 friggin' hours!,"Yeah, unbelievably 5 hours of this stuff! Yes, it's historical for being done in 1915 when there's no other film done at that time to compare it to. Obviously Mr. Griffith had lots of spare time on his hands to muster up a cast of thousands, plus a couple hundred Klansmen to boot. I gave it 3-stars (thats' a stretch) because of it's time period, but if you don't have the time for it-- skip it!"
3,"Yes it's racist propaganda, but-","Okay, we all know that when it comes to it's handling of Recontruction and the African-American situation, this film is raw, racist propaganda from the poison pen of Thomas Dixon. With that said, there are a couple of good things I can say about it.The ""historical facsimilies"" are probably what holds up best today than anything else in the film. The actors playing such historical characters as Lincoln, Robert E. Lee, John Wilkes Booth, Ulysses S. Grant, etc. are quite good and the recreations of Lincoln's assassination and the surrender at Appomatox are such that I have no problem showing these segments to my students in my US history class to illustrate these events.Unfortunately, there's the matter of the rest of the film, which has already been discussed....too bad."
3,Window into racist minds,"It is astonishing anyone could still watch this film and suggest Griffith might have been anything less than totally aware of the racist tone of the film. The title, ""Birth of a Nation"" is a play on words meant to allow viewers to pretent it is about American history, when in fact the title is a reference to the director's hope for the birth of a new Aryan Nation to sweep over the country.This film is pure propoganda for the KKK. It was produced in a time when such a film could pass as real entertainment. So strong was Griffith's passion for the subject that he was driven to produce a work that redefined the movie industry.It is important to view this film and understand it as a window into a very dangerous aspect of American culture and history. But for the people involved in the making of this film, there ought to be nothing but condemnation. They should not only be compared with Nazis, but understood as America's mirror image of Nazi Germany. There is no real difference."
3,controversial,"Oh D.W. Griffith... what WERE you thinking?I had heard about this infamous film for some time, and finally decided that since it WAS the first feature length silent film, and since I was a Film major, I should watch it. Wow.This is not only an incredibly racist film- reaching Nazi anti-Jew propaganda levels, but it is also loooonnnggg and generally boring.The first half is duller than a plastic spoon- being a general Civil War story. The second half is about the heroism of the Ku Klux Klan and features them riding in gloriously to save the southern cities from the ""crazy negros"". I hesitated putting this review up after watching this classic trash because I actually felt dirty sitting there watching it, and had a difficult time digging past the content to appreciate it as the masterpiece it was."
4,Reason behind the review,"Let it be known to anyone who cares enough to read this. ""Birth of a Nation"" (in my opinon) is a terrible movie. Simply because it's total purpose and goal was the visual destruction of a group of people. No one deserves to be depicted the way Afican Americans are in the film. It was given the rating of number four becuase it successfully gets its point across. It is a part of the history of America (American cinema as well) and it should never be forgotten."
1,"Twas the Best of Movies, Twas the Worst of Movies...","This is a hard movie to rate.In its time, it was a masterpiece. By the standards of today, though, it is the most horrid thing ever to come out of Hollywood, racist to the core. It did not even have black actors portraying the black characters, such was the racism of the early 1900s.If you look at it through the eyes of a moviegoer who lived in the early 1900s, you would rate it ***** and then some.If you apply today's standards to it, though, it must be given the lowest rating possible."
2,So bad thats its now almost comic,This film is so bad and so racist that it boggles the mind. If one wanted to see how far one can push the right of freedom of speech this would be a textbook example. It just shows us how far this nation has come in the last 80 plus years in the matter of Civil Rights.
4,Interesting,"I just saw this last night for research. I am trying to write a book about the KKK and I need everything to be accurate and perfect. So I rented this. It was very good, except that it was pretty inane. It was very, very, very racist. I don't suggest an African-American see this - they'll be very offended. But the actors did a good job. But this leaves me wondering something. How can a black person act in this? I know that some wore make-up, but there were real ones and I just wonder how could they? Silas Lynch was creepy and I didn't like him. But this was a pretty funny movie where it wasn't racist."
3,Birth of a Nation,I have the silent movie version as well as the Vhs one and find that the film i have is far better than the dvd version .
5,Johnny is the greatest!,"I have been a John Farnham fan since my brother gave me the 'Age of Reason' c.d. for my birthday and he never fails to energise me. This c.d. is a compilation of most of his greats, from his socially conscious songs 'Age of Reason,' 'That's Freedom,' and 'You're the Voice' to his beautiful ballads, 'Touch of Paradise', 'Burn for you', and 'Angels', not to mention his fantastic version of the Beatles 'Help'. Also included are such geats as 'When something is wrong with my baby' with Jimmy Barnes, 'Everything's Alright' form Jesus Christ Superstar with Kate Cebrano and Jon Steven' and 'Everytime you cry' with Human Nature, all fantastic Australian vocalists themselves. Of course the winning track, that is still requested at every live performance for more than twenty years, is the fun-loving 'Sadie, the cleaning lady.' I would highly recommend this album to anyone interested in great music, either to start a John Farnham collection of just to compete it."
3,You're the Voice,"I only bought this CD for the track ""You're The Voice"". The others available were fine, but not great."
3,A decent book about sheep.,"I thought the author could have been more indepth regarding her treatment of each type of sheep. I didn't come away with as much information as I thought I would. However, in a general sense, it is an informative book on raising sheep."
4,Wild new interpretations of ancient Jewish melodies,"Frank London, Michael Alpert, Dave Krakauer and other modern Jewish music luminaries take a whirl at modernizing old Jewish ""khasene,"" or wedding songs, at least partly through a hip-hoppish filter. (There ought to be a clever, appropriate word in Yiddish that sort of, but not entirely, means ""remix""... I'm just not sure what it is...) Anyway, they don't quite sustain the hip-hopization of the material throughout the whole album, but it certainly sounds like they had fun on this project. Definitely puts a new spin on some old, old tunes, and klezmer enthusiasts will appreciate the originality and audacity of these recordings."
4,Pretty good,"One costumer ask for it and I bought it, our costumer is very happy with it. He said: ""it's pretty good, very effective"". :)"
1,"Bugs alive, Zapper dead",This product lasted a bit over a month before it stopped zapping. I was actually searching for a replacement transformaer for it when I ran across this opportunity to warn others. For the amout it cost I expected at least a season out of it. Also they make it impossible to disassemble for repair. Stay away.
1,Don't buy Stinger products!,"On the Texas Gulf Coast a bug zapper is necessary. I have used many over the last 25 years and for the last 5 years I have bought Stinger products. They are increasingly expensive and more shoddy and poor. This last 40 watt lasted one month last summer and now is BO. Bulb is out AND high voltage grid is BO. These latest models are built so the owner can not take them apart for repair. The Stinger products are absolute JUNK and a total waste of money. I will spread the word and only dream of someday coming face to face with an executive or engineer from that lousy , greedy and crooked company. JM Bowers"
1,junk beyond belief,Bought it today and ran it for an less than an hour before it clogged up. Took it down and blew out the dead bugs. Plug it back in and within 15 minutes it clogged up again. This time while I was unclogging the screen the dang bulb dropped out and shattered. Now I have to buy a $15 bulb just to return this piece of junk which I will tomorrow.
3,The bugs work too hard to get zapped,I cut the out side grill out so the bugs can get zapped easier and the birds can clean it in the morning
1,Same problem as others...,"Used it once last season, and once this season so far, and it has stopped working. Guess a lot of us are having the same problem..."
3,Clogs with Bugs,"This zapper worked for a couple of years. Then I got a second zapper, a Flowtron to cover the other side of the house. Every couple of weeks I would clean the Stinger zapper out with compressed air. Just blast some air thru it and a cloud of dead bugs sprays out of the zapper. I have done this since it was new. The new square zapper requires this at the end of the year only. I am not going to replace the bulb in the Stinger this time. I am going to buy another Flowtron zapper."
1,Not even a little durable,"Within ten minutes of playing fetch with my small dog, this ball was coming apart. Under the felt, there are two halves of a hollow ball and they started coming apart at the seam, tearing the felt. Definitely not worth it.My dog wasn't even chewing on it and it started coming apart; I would not recommend for a chewer.I'm still looking for a solid ball that won't come apart so quickly."
5,Get it. Buy several...you will want to give them to loved ones...,"Someone gifted me with the small blue-bound book over 25 years ago. It inspired me then and I have re-read it periodically over the years. It never fails to inspire and to bring me to a place of comfort and safety in my heart in this sometimes scary and overwhelming 3D reality.Others have included quotes from the book in their reviews, so you can get a sense of the book from them. I just want to encourage people to get this book. It will be the ONE book, if you could have it on a desert island, that you would want to have.I am buying (3) copies today. One to replace the one I gave away to a friend dying of AIDS, one to give to a friend currently dying of cancer, and one to keep for myself. It is a keeper!I have thousands of spiritual and metaphysical and channelled books of high intent, but this is my all-time favorite.GET IT! You will not be sorry. In fact, get several copies because you will want to give them to your loved ones..."
1,it stains teeth brown,"I started using Crest Pro-Health night toothpaste in January. By Feb I had developed a pronounced discoloration on my teeth, particularly between teeth. It looked like I chewed tobacco. I tried brushing harder, flossing more and mouthwashes, but it continued to get worse. I went to my regular dentist appt expecting to be told my teeth were rotting away. Much to my relief my dentist was able to remove most of it. It has be be scrapped off. She suppected it was a stannous fluoride rinse, but my rinse was ok, it was the toothpaste. This is a horribe product."
3,She'd barely survived the terrible scandal.....,"From back cover: Leonie knew the nightmare was behind her now, yet she couldn't help feeling bitter. Four years earlier her name had been splashed across the country on a charge of blackmail - a crime she'd been completely innocent of. But Giles Noble, the powerful prosecuting attorney, hadn't been convinced. Leonie still burned at the memory. How she longed to set the record straight! Her chance came when fate threw Giles and her together for a weekend - a weekend that brought changes to last a lifetime!"
4,Josh Kelley - Just say the word,"I didn't realize this cd was available until I stumbled across the ""Pop Game"" video on YouTube. So, I found the cd listed on Amazon and ordered it. Josh Kelley doesn't disappoint."
4,Good movie,"Good movie about the patriarch Jacob and his life with his deceptions, his trials, his wives and his return to his homeland after running away from his brother."
3,"It is ok, better than the other Jacob movies: err I don't think there are many.","I watched this last night and overall it was pretty well done, but what bothered me to give it only three stars where the horrible acting that the sons of Laban had in the movie. Also what was really disappointing is that Jacob went straight over to Rachel when it was different in the bible as some of you may know. The running time was sort of sad too, I wish it could have gone on longer and extended but sometimes you just can't. All and all it was much better than watching some of the stuff on television today."
2,Cheap Thrills in a Cheap Case,"The movie depicts mostly soft-core material, though it surprises the viewer with a few explicit scenes. There are, however, some vivid moments that hard-core enthusiasts would no doubt appreciate. The picture quality is mediocre.If you're interested in a few thrills, then get this flick. However, good luck in getting a disc that isn't scratched or cracked. The studio, Blue Underground, has used the worst of all DVD cases to house this movie: the one whose hub consists of four sharp-edged high-pressure prongs that do little more than damage a disc. My disc arrived with multiple scratches and a small crack in the center. I note that another reviewer had a similar complaint. The company eagerly publicizes the resurgence of an uncut classic but decides to supply low-cost, inferior cases with a DVD that isn't cheap. Foolish."
5,A little book of hope when hope is gone,"This is a wonderful, beautiful book that I have kept for years. I turn to it in times of loss, or grief. It reminds me that God is the God of resurrection and He brings Life out of death, always. Great Gift"
1,did not work properly,when i installed it into my car it did not function properly and i heard popping noises from my subs and then it blew them both
3,Did not work for tie-dye,Used various colors of this for tie dye. I couldn't get the dye and salt dissolved completely in the bottles. The colors were not true because it was too concentrated. Additionally it contains a grit-like substance that clogged the bottles.I am giving it 3 stars because I did not follow the enclosed directions.
1,Time and Money Down the Drain,"I ordered this item a few months ago from the seller ""Stuff 4 Scrapbooking."" Not only did the dye not work, but the seller was completely useless. First of all it was shipped in a HUGE box. Too big to fit in my mailbox and was sent back to the post office. I have no idea why such a small item was in a gigantic box but it added hassle that I did not want to deal with.. If I wanted to drive around for fabric dye I would have gone to the store and picked it up myself. I have tried dies in the past and they have not worked - considering this one had good reviews I tried it and failed just like the rest. I even let my ONE item sit over night, it couldn't even dye one single item. The seller contacted me to see if I was satisfied and I was not, I never heard from them again. Do not waste your time or money."
5,Great watch,This watch is heavy and good band nice looking face on the watch. I am very hard on watches from the work I do and the fossel watches are tough look good and keep good time. Will buy anouther one when I kill this one.
5,A Great Book in the Abby Hayes Series!!!!!,I think this book is great if you are reading the Abby Hayesseries. It's a great book if your in the 4-6th grades. I really enjoy the Abby Hayes series a lot and read some of them in a day or less. I give this book a great review.
5,Worked Great!,"Fit perfectly, Easy to install. Made the rest of the install go fast. Looks great! Price was better that other places that I checked."
1,Absolutely horrible,I read this book for a United Nations Organization class. I though it was absolutely horrible. I belive it was written badly. I would not recommend this book.
5,Dr. Layachi,Dr. Layachi is one of the most educated men I have ever met and he is truly an expert in the field of international relations. His book is quite interesting and it seems that the only complaints come from students that were unhappy with the grade they recieved in class. The book is worth reading and is a great comprehensive view of Morrocan-American relations.
3,Old School,If you want to get into PC modding this is a good reference for starting off. I do have to say that the book is already starting to show it's age with some of the mod projects.
4,"L'Artisan Parfumeur worn by Kate in ""The Joneses""",I did like this movie but I do not have a review. Instead I think I have the answer to a question I have seen expressed by other people.We have all wondered what is the name of the perfume that Kate allows her fake daughter to use and I think either one of these is the correct answer:L'Artisan Parfumeur La Chasse aux Papillons Extrme Eau de ParfumorL'Artisan Parfumeur Nuit de Tubéreuse Eau de Parfum
4,Good show-worth a rent,"A reviewer on my library website said this show was ""supposed to be a comedy but there wasn't a laugh in it"". Well, I would say ""this show is a light drama/dark comedy and there wasn't a laugh in it"". If I had to compare it to something, I would say it is just a bit like Donnie Darko. Along the same vein, but a bit lighter in context.I enjoyed this show. It's not groundbreaking, though it is pretty special for a movie to have a plot that we've never seen before. The acting is fine...not award winning. But it was just quite enjoyable and I'd tell you to definitely rent it. You won't feel your evening was wasted (like with some movies)I enjoyed both Demi and David..... Oh, and interestingly, for a movie about product promotion, this movie also had a requisite name brand to promote. It was obvious...as they all are nowadays. But I smiled when the the product promotion was actually being made TO US, and not just to the neighbors on the street."
3,"""The Joneses"", the movie",Not nearly as good as the previews. Not Demi Moore's best performance either. The idea of this movie is unique but could havebeen done better by less couple's drama and more indepth mind control by marketing company they work for.
2,Wanted to like it but...,"The premise for this book is what caught my attention but the story itself disappointed, especially as a huge J. Deveraux fan. I liked Nicole's character and the contrasting view of the very bloody French revolution with 18th century revolutionary America and, because of it, I think this story could have been something so much more... but the character development and the relationship development was uneven AND voluminous... sometimes less is more."
2,I had a real hard time with this one...,"Maybe it's just me but doesn't the main character lack any heroic qualities whatsoever. I never fell for this guy. He was weak and kinda sick in the head. This weird fixation (Bianca) on the image of his past weird fixation (brother's wife) really seemed on the verge of insanity. The only one who I was endeared to was Nicole. She stayed strong and in most cases wore the pants in this book.I truly felt sorry for the spoiled, Bianca. Nobody deserves to be treated so nasty but most especially it should not be made out to be a good thing to call people some pretty aweful names. In the beginning of the book she was just a spoiled, pampered brat but after being ridiculed and verbally abused. Even the children were allowed to treat her badly.I just didn't care much for this book. I can honestly say it was not a bad read but I felt I was disagreeing with the author the entire time."
4,Great Album,"THis is a great album, its very long (great for driving), with 14 songs, some stand out way more than others, thats the nature of buying an album. If you want to buy cds that only have the chart hits on it, buy the singles... And comparing it to Bat out of Hell I and II, each album is meant to be different, and each album was recorded at different stages in Meatloaf career.... If you want Bat out of Hell I, buy Bat out of Hell I. Anyway approach this album for a new sonic experiance and you will be pleasantly suprised."
1,Disappointing,Definitely NOT the Meatloaf I have come to expect. Sounds like he needed to put an album out to boost the ol checking account balance and strained himself in the process. There's nothing here for Meatloaf fans that want more of the first 2 albums.
5,True Meat Loaf Form,"I hesitated to buy this album initially, even though I am a long time MAJOR Meat Loaf fan. The samples that music providers like amazon provide are so-so at best, and some of the earlier reviews were iffy. I have tried many times in the past to go to a concert unsuccesfully, but made it to his recent tour. He played several of the songs from this album. The title track, Bad for Good, If it ain't broke, and Blind as a Bat. This was enough to make up my mind to buy it. Like alot of Meat Loaf songs, you've got to listen to them more than once to get them. This album is no different.On this album, Meat has several songs that are good solid rock songs.The rest are Meat Loaf in his true form. Theatrical, a little over the top, and dripping with passion. Great singing guitar riffs, great piano chords, and phenomenal vocals. Songs that tell a story so strongly that the listener can feel the emotion. If you like Meat Loaf, you will love this album."
1,This album is crap.,"I was skeptical when I bought this CD, and my gut instincts were proven to be valid. This album sucks. The original BOOH is, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest albums of all times. Also, I am a big Queen fan and think Brian May is perhaps the best guitarist of all times. I also like Steve Vai. As a teenager, I was a fan of Motley Crue (at least their first 3 albums) and was intrigued that Nikki Sixx co-wrote a song.But it's all smoke and mirrors. The only high point on this disappointing CD is Marion Raven's voice. SHE can sing! Everything else is over-prodouced, over-dramatic and under-performing.Borrow a friend's copy of this CD before spending $14 for your own copy. It'll be like renting a Hyundai (or some other crappy car) for the weekend before deciding to buy one. You'll be glad you did.This CD is crap I tell you... pure, unadulterated [...]."
4,An OK Entry,"This third entry in the Bat Out Of Hell albums is OK. In my opinion there was really only good entry ""The Monster Is Loose."" But over all is is good."
3,Lacks female vocal match to Meatloaf's skill and range,"I have listened to this album at home, in my car and at work - in various locations and on a range of equipment. I feel that the vocals performed by Patti Russo match so well with Meatloaf's skill, range and power. The others seem to be coming from what to me sounds like a teenager reaching out but not acheiving anywhere near his skills and abilities. Patti Russo - to me - reaches Meatloafs presence in performance skills, and more importently vocal range and power.Listen closely to her performance in ""Could't Have Said It Better"" - hear her ability to match his ability to sustain both clarity and tone and you will understand what I am alluding to.Bat III would have far greater impact with Patti at the helm on lead female vocals."
3,"Ok, but shouldn't be called a ""Bat""","Love Meat. Love Steinman. This one's missing most of the Steinman. Should be called ""Loaf Outta Hell"" or ""Welcome Back to the Neighborhood Again,"" but ""Bat III"" is a misrepresentation."
2,Where's the Motorcycle?,"My first impression of this album is that it doesn't sound like a Bat out of Hell production. The first two albums at least had the theme of a Motorcycle given the albums an impression that it was like a soundtrack for a road movie. The motorcycle road movie theme seems missing on this particular album, apart from the album cover artwork. There also seemed to be an emotional content missing somewhere and the album itself wasn't telling me a story like I was on some mystical journey.The songs I do like on this album are ""It's All Coming Back To Me Now"" by Jim Steinman, ""Cry Over Me"" by Dianne Warren, ""If God Could Talk"" by Desmond Child. However ""Cry Over Me"" sounds a bit weird because it is written from a female perspective. The other songs on the album didn't do more for me, even the Steinman penned songs.This album isn't my cup of tea and I would advise anyone contemplating getting it to at least listen to it first to make up their own minds."
1,What Happened?!?,I was so excited to see Meatloaf was making another Bat Out Of Hell because I've worn out the previous 2. But I was not expecting the sound (I can't seem to call it music) that came from that cd. I felt like Meatloaf was trying to change his style to be cool and it backfired.
2,Most Bats don't live this long.,"And neither does the Bat Out Of Hell series. When I first heard The Monster Is Loose, I thought of the theatrical grabbing songs of previous Bats. I knew this wouldn't be as good, but was hoping it would at least be good. After track one I can pretty much turn it off. I'll stick with the first two Bats, and Welcome To The Neighborhood."
2,Two stars because of its legacy...,"...I mean, after all, this is the Ironman series we're talking about...but for content, avoid this. Rather, do yourself a favor and pick up Franco Columbo's book. It is far, far superior and will give you much better results, and much superior advice.However, all the other Ironman books, with the exception of the ""natural bodybuilding"" book, should be picked up."
4,ironmans ultimate nutriton,"I bought this book as well as the Ironmans ultimate mass guide.I found both books to be of great vaulue.I have learned a great deal about nutrition.Although the book does not cover a great deal, it does however explain how to build a good nutrional base.I suggest anyone wanting to learn about mass and nutrion,get both books as they complment each other very well.I rate this book 4 to 4 1/2.I did not know what I was missing til now."
3,Contains Niacin,Love this brand but was disappointed to find it contained niacin. Niacin causes heat flushes for me. Will give it a try regardless.
4,Not as good as real potatoes,"These taste as good as normal instant mashed potatoes. I found out you must follow the directions exactly. Don't use milk, use the cream as directed. If you are a diabetic, these are better than no mashed potatoes at all, and don't raise your numbers after a meal."
2,Gross,"I didn't like the taste of them at all. It's very powdery and just doesn't taste good, but maybe some people will find the taste appealing. The reason I gave this review 2 stars is because they shipped them on time and although I personally don't like the taste others might.Remember these are low-carb so the taste will never be 100% like real mashed potatoes, but I couldn't stomach them."
4,Excellant as an addition...,"I haven't tried these by themselves; I add them to my cauliflower mash and my cauliflower ""potato"" salad (1/4 cup to one head)and use them to ""bread"" my fried chicken. Adds a nice starchy feel to the cauliflower creations and and a nice crunch to the chicken. Will be purchasing them again. Other reviews talked about an off flavor, but I used to feel the same way about real instant potatoes, so it isn't surprising. Only downside is the cost."
3,Best of the Two,The first half is good with only some acceptable changes to the story for time. Unfortunetly they changed the thief into a ruthless murderer out for revenge which reduces the emotional appeal of the story. My rating is actually 3 1/2 for the first half is a 4 but the changes to the ending lower it to a 3. If you want an Ian Richardson Sherlock Holmes this is the one to buy do not touch The Hound of the Baskervilles.
1,No Good!!!,Not nearly enough detail or personal non-marketing information. The book is less than basic and appears as though the author was paid to advertise certain companies. There is better information out there. Save your money on this one!!!!
4,Taxi horn bulb,"Does what I wanted it to do! I built this into a Harpo Marx style taxi horn, along with a reed and a tube. Where else but Amazon are such obscure items available?"
5,Just like our political leaders!,"King of Paper chasin' is completely relevant to the world today, especially the thugs that are our political figures, they're runnin' the same game. Watch it and get your education."
3,sorority girl,"The tape was in great shape and was delivered as promised.The movie was just so-so,I guess typical of the low-budget B movies of that era.I bought it as i like seeing obscure actors in various roles,I find it interesting.June Kenney was one of those."
3,Not what it could be.,"It's not the ""Authentic"" belly dance music is should be or could be. I teach belly dancing and it is very hard to use this CD as a demonstration of music, so I just quit."
4,Crying Wind Master Storyteller,"Many readers are familiar with Crying Wind's first two books, Crying Wind and My Searching Heart. This volume continues the story of her life. Crying Wind is a master story teller who uses her Native American background to bring truth and beauty to a story of laughter, pain, joy, adventure. Crying Wind's story is witness to the way God spans time and cultures with His love. Parents and children alike will enjoy this account of how Little Antilope, Lost Deer, Snow Cloud, and Spring Cloud grew up in their dual world with their parents Crying Wind and Don Stafford. Crying Wind tells her story compellingly, beautifully including how she adjusted to life afer Don's sudden death. This is a book for those who have seeking hearts, and all who enjoy beauty. The testimony to the strength of faith has never been more forcefully presented."
3,"Good book, but I've lost my trust in the author","My husband and I read aloud Crying Wind's first 2 books, while traveling. We laughed, we cried, we believed we were reading a true story of the author's life. So, years later, I was eager to read this, her third book. Before I bought it, however, I learned that Crying Wind is not an Indian, even in part. She made a whole bunch up, and I am so disappointed in her. I went ahead and bought this third book, but I read it as fiction, because I don't trust anything the author says anymore. It was still a decent book to read, but I sure couldn't get my heart into it, and will never recommend it to my friends."
2,Boring,"OK, I love early Ludlum. That about says it. Icarus starts off too slow, never picks up and should not be signed by Ludlum at all. Wonder if that's when his books started to be ghost-written. Giving it 2 stars in case it was written by Ludlum."
5,Slow Action Spy Thriller = 5/5,I loved this book. Many people might disagree with me. This book is heavy on having many plots interwine with each other and lets just say Ludlum stuffed ALOT into this book...then again he always fills his books so much that you gotta really think and make everything turn into sense. This is a book divided into 3 parts and the 2nd part is the longest and the most complex. I enjoyed reading this book.
2,He's a rambling man...,"Read at your own risk of falling asleep. I have read 12 or more of Ludlum's books. They have always satisfied. This latest one however is just too rambling. The story line is stretched to the limit with an endless string superlatives and hyperbole. If I could return my Kindle ebook, I would. Sorry, it's just not up to his usual high level."
3,Not so hot,"This wasn't that good. I don't know why I kept reading it. I suppose I wanted to know what would happen. The character is unbelievable. I was wondering how they could sneak up and take pictures of someone out kayaking in the wild. I think about that sometimes when I'm in the wilderness. There were some other parts that were better. If it wasn't so long it would have been good. Having long laughable love scenes with Arab women is like a bad romance novel. I wonder if Ludlum wrote this himself or if he was using a ghostwriter already, possibly coming up with parts of it and passing off the rest like Tom Clancy does."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This novel is related to The Chancellor Manuscript in some ways. There is another secret cabal at the heart of the USA, but this one is not so crazy as some of the other terrorists, crazy generals, or whatever.They are looking for a man with integrity, but the man they want they suspect may be involved with dodgy goings on to cause big problems in the Middle East. He isn't, of course, he just wanted revenge on a man that killed some friends.Now, he goes undercover to work out what is going on, and to prove himself."
1,Not his best effort,"I've read everything Ludlum wrote, and this is the only one I couldn't finish. Sorry, but too difficult to follow. Not his best effort, by far."
3,"Useful information, but based on old Web sites","I appreciate the research of Jared Spool et al at User Interface Engineering, and have consulted it often as I review and design user interface elements. I will, no doubt, do the same with this book. It helps that I've been a longtime fan of the Edmunds.com site, which was part of the research this book reports. Now my gut feeling about that site's good usability is backed up by a usability-study report.But wait! Edmunds.com has been redesigned since 1997, which is when this usability study took place. So have most, if not all, of the other sites. This book's screen shots of the sites in the study make the book look like a museum of the 1997 World Wide Web. These sites actually look quaint!I wonder whether this book's findings have decayed and have become less useful. My concern is not stopping me from using this book as a reference tool, but I do reserve some skepticism in applying its results."
1,"Simple minded, idiotic conclusions...","I'll make this short. Here's a quote from this book:""Of course, graphics may be important in other ways, such as for conveying marketing messages, making users more willing to return to the site, or selling products. We didn't measure these, so we don't know. But as far as we can tell, graphic design is completely unrelated to success in finding information on web sites.""This is the problem with simple-minded HCI-centric nerds without a sense of design. They often come to conclusions based on poorly designed tests. For example, these same fools might have nixed the iPhone's pinch-to-zoom feature because it's truly not discoverable (discoverability being a major metric in usability tests). However, obviously the issue is much more complex than that. One must weigh the costs of messaging (instructing) the feature against its benefits. I could go on for hours..."
3,"Great workout, but a little loud","I agree with the other reviews. It gives a great workout, I've had it since January 2008, and used it many times, although quit when the weather started getting nicer.I do have a problem with the noise (squeaking) that it makes when you work out on it. I feel like I'm going to wake the whole house up when I use it. My husband swears he can't hear it upstairs (i'm in the basement), but I can't even hear the tv or my music over the noise. Must find a way to grease or stop the noise somehow."
1,I thought I was ordering a CD!,I was in the CD section so I'm not sure how I received a book. I am not interested in reading it and will just give it to the Goodwill. I want funny CD's for road trips.
1,Sizing is poor,"Gave these a shot because of the price. Despite looking at all of the reviews for sizing information, they are HUGE. Short should fit snugly - but not be constricting. Instead, they are loose to the point of easily being a size too big. I am 5'8"" and a consistent size 8 quality women's clothing. Other reviewers noted the loose waist - very accurate. If you are slim hipped, you'll have a fairly large 'gap' in the waist."
1,Not true to size,"Not a whole lot of information with regard to sizing on the Valeo Neoprene Shorts. Product sizing should be more detailed. I normally take a size medium and these were way too big. Amazon would not allow me to return them for a different size, which meant shipping costs to return the item and more shipping costs to re-purchase a smaller size. Also, there was NO OPTION on the return request to indicate that sizing was the reason for the return."
1,Item is cheap and HUGE!,I followed the sizing recommendations for ordering and was shocked to receive the size I ordered. It is enormous. They are supposed to fit snug and compress. These shorts would be loose on a Hippo !
2,Valeo Neoprene Shorts,"Fit was not as expected, however I have to now assume that these were designed specifically for men...not women. When I work out in these shorts on my indoor rowing machine the waist gaps open alot in the back. Just not a good fit for me. Sorry I bought these."
4,Too BIG,The sizing scale is not true to size and I must wear the shorts underneath real shorts or warm ups. They still draw out the water weight and I would purchase a smaller size again.
1,Golden Children's Bible: by Joseph Miralles (Illustrator),"After reading the reviews and impressed with the front of the book cover, I decided to get this book as a gift for one of the children at the church.The cover depicts people of ethnicity, however the pictures inside tell a different story. For example, Jesus, a Jew, is characterized by blond hair and blue eyes; the Queen of Sheba, a white woman, only to name a few. NOT SO!If a writer is going to tell history, the words as well as the pictures should depict the truth!I give this book a rating of 1 star based on the pictures, not the contents. I returned the book for that reason!"
5,Great Bible for little ones,This is a great Bible to start kids off in learning how to read along in a regular bible. I like the stories & think they follow along with the stories in a regular bible. My girls are enjoying it.
4,Quality book,"This is a finely illustrated and colorful book for children with meaningful text. As far as the 'racist' comments doesn't that in itself cause division and not inclusion? And God forbid that anything should favor the dreaded Northern Europeans! The theory of Biblical multi-culturalism should be stood up against the Book of Nehemiah, how God favors Israel as His Peculiar people and take a close look at the dipersion in the story of Babel. Some food for thought."
5,My Fondest Memories,"As a children's ministry leader, I bought a few of these to give out to some kids. I read this Children's Bible cover to cover multiple times on my own as a child, and it really developed in me a true desire for God's Word. I recommend this book for any young reader. Don't turn them off by giving them an adult Bible when they are young and cannot read or understand it. Get them excited with this first."
2,Predictable Formula Story ...But What Did You Expect Then?,"""Keeping Kate"" is a story about Aaron, a young widower who needs a nanny for his baby girl, and Kate who needs a job. Aaron hires Kate and the story starts to progress in predictable ways. A subplot deals with Kate's real mother who is looking for her three children who were taken away from her years ago.This book doesn't offer anything new to the good old romance formula. Characters and conflicts between them are rather realistic - there are no tropical islands and mysterious millionaires here. However, this also makes plot twists somewhat unimaginative and one-dimensional. I also felt that the subplot about the reunion of Kate's family was mostly an unnecessary appendage. There are neither rewarding challenges nor anything dangerous here. I would only recommend this to someone who is willing to waste a couple of hours reading insignificant, mildly pleasing and harmless entertainment."
4,A good read,"This is a really good book. I think that all parents should read it and learn to slow down in all aspects of their own life and that of their children. Some of what the author says is commonsense but much is sobering and needs to be said.It is a book I will continually refer to, to help me ensure that I'm on track and not rushing my children to grow up. Childhood is so short."
2,How many more pages??,"While Dr. David Elkind is a respected name in the Child Psychology arena, I found that anything of value or knowledge that he presented in The Hurried Child is merely common sense. It scares me to think that there are actually people out in this world, reproducing, who need to read this book.Dr. Elkind expressed some valid points on the general ""rush of society"" - our tendency to saddle our children with competition in the adult world, but nothing that needed 221 pages of interpretation. Dr. Elkind takes an extremist position on his point of view throughout the book. Despite the books' attempts at valuable lessons, they are dissected into such meaningless pieces that any cohesive lesson is lost. The reality is we are living in a rapidly changing society, and individuals need to do their best to strive at an individual pace to attain what they perceive as success."
3,ROCKETSHIP X-M,"This movie has stuck with me since the first time I saw it on television when I was a kid. It was the first time in any of the 50's SciFi movies I loved as a kid, and still do, I noted that the heroes of the movie die at the end of the film. They get a chance to deliver their message, but they don't make it. In watching this again as an adult, I recognize the movie is not very good, that is, not very well produced. The affects and dialogue are cheesy, as is the acting. But it's the story which holds up, the message of caution regarding our nuclear ambitions. As a kid growing up in the 60's I appreciated the hope of the message delivered by the doomed heroes."
4,Very beautiful,"I bought this cd and the playback singers together 3 weeks ago. I am a fan of Galaxie 500 and I liked some Luna stuff but I had never listened to anything by this project, so this reason and the fact that the cd's were very cheap, made me bought both cds. I think this cd is the most accesible of all the albums they have done. If you like Galaxie 500 I'm pretty sure you will like this album. Some songs are as great as Galaxie 500's best songs. The opening track is so beautiful, it sounds like a psychedelic Beatles. I downloaded some songs of the other albums, and I might say this one is my favorite and the closest to Galaxie 500 music."
1,really boring,This cd is really boring. I can't imagine that they were motivated enough to go to the trouble of making it. I'd rather listen to people tuning guitars.
2,"This is not what I would think of as ""happy hardcore"".","When I saw an american Happy Hardcore release, I was excited. However, this was a substandard release that is less than happy. This music is closer to Gabber/Hardcore without the uplifting feeling of the rave scene. I was extremely saddened by its mislabeled packaging. There is no happy in this hardcore music. I would give it 3 out of five stars as a hardcore album, but it is too simplistic to keep any listener occupied. For my tastes, I will listen to my 140+ BPM series or HAPPY2BHARDCORE CDs from the Moonshine record label... They are out of print - good luck finding em!"
4,I agree...,"I am now an adult, and have kept my copies of My Friend Flicka and Thunderhead. By some horrible oversight, it appears I never purchased the final book in the trilogy, Green Grass of Wyoming, and thought I might buy it now. I now find it's out of print. What is the logic of keeping the first two parts of a trilogy in print and not the third?It's been years since I read this one, but if memory serves the book is more for adults than children. It focuses a great deal on Nell and her relationship with her husband now that her children are grown. It is a horse story in the loosest sense of the term, in that a horse ranch provides the background for what goes on. I definitely recommend it, and maybe if enough people ask the publisher will bring it back."
1,Do not buy this book!,"This book is only 121 pages. Also, it is a paperback. I paid $11 +shipping from Munn books."
3,I Feel Cheated -- Repackaged Workouts in a Different DVD Set,"Just a word of warning: check the workouts before you buy new DVDs as you might already have them. I've had Walk Away the Pounds Express 1 & 2 mile walks for a few years now, and I thought it was time to buy a new DVD. I purchased this one recently, thinking I would get 4 new workouts. Lo and behold, the 2 mile mile walk on both DVDs is the SAME! I feel deceived. I had no idea that Leslie repackages her workouts into new DVDs. I really do like her workouts so I gave this set three stars. This package of four walks (including a stretchie band) is a good deal if you don't already have other walks."
4,Leslie is great,I love Leslie she makes me feel comfortable.She encourages you; never pressures you.The steps are easy to follow. Iv'e only done the one-mile workout so far and I like it.I have done the two-mile workout on one of her other videos and had no problemkeeping up. It is a great workout without the exhausting jumping and bouncing ofaerobics.
5,Walk Away the Pounds Ultimate Collection (w/stretchie band),"Leslie Sansone's super DVD which allows you to individually select a 1, 2, 3 or 4 mile walk with an included ""stretchie resistance band"". Wonderful to have the choices all on one DVD. It's a great energizing workout for people of all fitness levels, even this eighty-one year-old grandmother."
4,good but too much talking,"I enjoy the workout, it is quick, easy but effective. However, Leslie talks non-stop through the entire video, usually repeating herself frequently! Wow, I've started watching it on mute because I can't handle her constant talking, for no particular reason except to hear herself talk."
2,No stretchie resistance band,While the DVD package indicates that a strechie band is included...it is NOT. I think that is deceptive. The information is there right on the cover. Why wouldn't the buyer think that the band would be included in the shipment?
5,My absolute favorite workout!,"Since I am 26 and in decent shape, I was slightly apprehensive at first about whether or not this video would be enough to reach my workout goals. After doing the 3 mile, I was amazed. I hate doing cardio but with this video I always have fun and I quickly lost the pounds I wanted to shed. It is great to stay in shape, cut cellulite, reduce stress, and feel energized. It is challenging but not so tough that you feel you can't finish. It is very do-able which is what I love. I cannot recommend this dvd enough!!"
5,Love it,"I love this workout I only have made it through 1 mile but look forward to making my way up to 2, and 3 miles in the next couple of months. I did the walking program before via my on demand programming, so I knew about Leslie, this is a little different but still easy to follow. I would recommend this product to those that have not worked out in awhile or if you have only a little time."
5,Great Workout!,I'm very pleased with this workout. It's easy on the knees and gets the heart rate up. The one mile is challenging but not too much of a challenge for someone who hasn't worked out for a very long time. Leslie's instructions are easy to follow and I believe this is a workout I can stick with.
5,"Great price, great workout!","I am a fan of the Leslie Sansone dvds and own a small collection. This is a favorite. Great workout, good price!"
5,The only Flavor I can stand,I hate when popel lite the funny smelling sandwood or what ever other flavorsThis one flavor smells so fresh and clean the cones light easy you will need a metal holder to keep from burning stuff
1,The Ultimate History of Rock and Roll Chapter 7,"If you are hoping to find original recordings of the songs on here that you were so used to hearing, don't buy this CD. The collection is great but there are only 3 original recorded selections. Unfortunately, I only realized until I had already opened it. All the other selections are new stereo recordings. Although the sound quality is better, they are not what you are used to hearing. Tube amplifiers still sound the best!!!"
4,Wonderfully Inspiring,"This book is simply inspiring. Page after page of poetic, uplifting words. Great for women of absolutely any age. Great for reading all at once or a page at a time, savoring the words. Just a beautiful piece."
5,Bing Crosby IS Christmas!,I am a Christmas Music fan! I simply love all the songs and the feeling it creates. This record is no exception.
1,Completely frustrating!!,I have tried about five times now with the correct instructions. The bottle just won't stop leaking. My dog has to be on an airplane for eight hours. The instructions tell you to completely which also means that if it leaks my dog will be sitting in half a gallon of water with nowhere to go. Completely not wort the risk!!!
1,needed one,"i will be returning this as it leaks, i needed one for a friend who has a pet raccoon. he needed one that was bigger so i ordered it but it leaks and makes his bed all wet. i hope the next one they send wont leak as it seems like it would be great"
2,Body Lotion and Cream,I can't say as I'm too impressed with this for the price and description don't quite match as far as I'm concerned. It smells more like coconut and vanilla which is okay because I like both but I was counting on the chocolate aroma and I smell none. It will make a good enough hand and body lotion but I will not reorder.
4,Well done,Of all the assorted Broadway Musical Various Artist CDs this is my favorite. Probably because there's no Andrew Lloyd Weber.
1,poor pictures,"I thought this book would really be good, however the pictures are poorly done, they look like he took a picture of a picture,mostly black and white and not very detailed. this book is way over priced and I was very disapointed all way around.The Author does not teach you how to tell if you have a Fostoria item or not,he doesnt tell how to detect a fake, dont spend your money on this high priced book you will be sorry!"
4,Another Book in the Jane Jeffrey Series,"Jane Jeffrey, suburban housewife and sometime detective, accompanies her friend Shelley to learn more about a summer camp for their community's students. What they never expected though was the remote campsite, interesting guests and murder.Fear of Frying is the 9th book in the Jane Jeffrey series which I first began reading in 1998. The series began with the recenly widowed Jane as she helps to solve the murder of a local housekeeper in Grime and Punishment and has continued with other murders and personal events. Note the clever titles based on other well known book titles.For the most part I have enjoyed all of Ms. Chruchill's books and Fear of Frying is no exception. I am also in the process of reading the author's second series, the Grace and Favor series which began with Anything Goes.If you enjoy light and cozy tales of murder and mayhem, consider reading either of these series and enjoy."
4,Strange food,"I'm not really sure that I'd ever eat anything from this cookbook on a regular basis, but it makes a great gift for anyone who loves the Roald Dahl books. I think the recipies are more for something like parties or if you have a picky eater."
1,Not a good book and insane price,I don't think the author has enough experience in the Data Management field.
4,Very warm!,"I bought matching pajamas for my boyfriend and myself. He is about 6 feet and 250lbs, I got the extra large and it was obviously the right size, and he loves the jammies. I'm 5'5 at 150 and got small, which feels slightly tight for my height when I stretch and i don't like to button the top button. The feet are on the large side for me (wear 7.5) although it probably works out with it being on the pajamas being on short side. Not a big deal for sitting although they sort of get twisted around at times, but when i walk I end up walking on the tops as they sort of flop under.In a house full of animals (3 cats and a dog) and the pajamas are not showing the hair nearly as much as i expected being black. The material doesn't seem to grab hair like some fabrics tend to do.Overall really glad I bought them!"
1,poor customer service,"Before you buy this product be aware that it is non returnable even if it was only removed from the boxto see this it was too small . Poor customer service since it tooks days to reach somebody byemail or phone. Told absolutely"" no"" to all their products for returns. The item was xxlarge andwouldn't fit a child. Once I filed a complaint, then I received an email that there was possibly a wayto return the item if I was willing to jump through the following hoops. To be honest, the poor customerservice was worse than buying a useless item that was money thrown away."
2,Didn't work - back to piney fresh,"This one lasted about 6 hours. I hate that I have to go back to the pine smelling Aubrey but it's the only one that seems to last. I see Aubrey has another scent, city something, that's more appealing to me as a woman, but I haven't found it in the deodorant."
1,smells like urinal blocks,"The new E Plus High C scent is a definite step down from the previous one I used for years and had gotten from Amazon and the local health food store. I gave it one more shot because the ad for it showed a blue cap and described it differently--but what I received is the same old (new) one with the dark green cap and the unappealing scent. I'm thinking of switching to Weleda Sage--more pricey but seems to work well, and it smells better."
2,Not for me,"The deodorant works OK against body odor, but it has a somewhat strong and not too pleasant smell itself that is unlikely to be noticeable by others in a social setting, but I find it distracting."
5,Best I've Found,"I tried all the regular store brand deodorants. They all stained my shirts, got white gunk all in my arm pits, were sticky like glue if they were clear, nasty... I finally found Men's Herbal Pine and have been using for 5 years. It goes on clear with a manly scent. I use 4 pumps per pit. This is not an antiperspirant! IF your pits really stink, you may not be happy with this. If I have had a hard day, I may end up a little musty at the end of the day but I am willing to give up a little for an organic deodorant that works perfectly 95% of the time."
5,Love this stuff,"I went from being very anti-cologne to using this every day.The smell is very ""masculine"" and is just the right strength.My girlfriend really loves it.I like the fact that it's organic; I hate buying products with synthetic and chemical products.Highly recommended."
3,It's been reformulated as of late 2012,"I have been a loyal user of this deodorant for almost 10 years. It was great stuff.For some reason, they decided to completely reformulate it. It's still OK, but I don't like the new smell. It's sort of medicine-y. It also doesn't seem to stave off BO quite as well as the original formula. I guess I'll be on the hunt for something new. This is the first time I recall ever being disappointed by something Aubrey Organics made.For the new ingredient list, see their website. The list above (first ingredient: rose water) is no longer correct."
2,"Mmmmmmm, nope","Too bad. I liked the list of ingredients but the ""nose"" didn't deliver, I just don't like the smell. Also, as far as effectiveness goes, I'm much happier with the Weleda deodorant sprays....those are divine!"
3,no charger,"i reiceved my gameboy advance sp a couple of days ago. i really enjoy it, i think its a good product. the only issue i have and forgive me if i missed it but it came with no charger. now i got to wait again for the charger. boooo"
4,SP is cool!,"I have a Game Boy Advance SP and I think if you're wanting to buy a new Game Boy I'd reccomend checking out one.The sidelit screen is awsome.The clamshell design is great for protecting the screen and buttons from getting scratched.The rechargable battery and AC adapter are cool.The only thing I don't really like about it is it doesn't have a standard headphone jack but some toy stores(like Toys ""R"" Us)sell headphone adapters and besides,there's already a stereo speaker.The reason I rated its educational value 1 star because I am not sure of it.One thing,if you have one I wouldn't play a game while charging your SP if I were you,because it messes up the screen.Please take my advice and buy the SP."
4,"Tense, well-acted drama","Denzel Washington plays Major Ben Marco, a veteran of the Gulf War who keeps having disturbing dreams about a mission he led in Kuwait. The mission included Raymond Shaw, a man whom Marco recommended for the Medal of Honor, and who is now running for Vice-President of the United States. Shaw is constantly manipulated by his mother, played with conniving perfection by Meryl Streep. Soon Marco begins to discover that there is some truth to his dreams and he realizes that he and Shaw, along with their whole unit, were programmed to act as they did. There is some overkill in the plot and the intensity of the characters, but all in all this is a riveting movie which keeps the viewer guessing until all is revealed at the end."
4,Classic Movie,"Great performance as always by Denzel Washington, loved that I could watch it on Prime. I will watch it again one day."
3,"Same stuff, different day.","We preferred the original after viewing this redo. This was ok, if you hadn't seen the original years ago. I was curious to see how people were equating the movie to the present day regime."
1,stinker,"I love the Sinatra version of this movie and I also love Denzel, so I had high hopes for the remake. It was awful!! I can't believe the powers that be screwed up such a great story. Do not waste your time with this one...check out the original."
1,Another Six Words ....Well Seven,"To supplement the 13th January 2007 review by ""1chiqu"", I'd like to add:AND MERYL STREEP IS NO ANGELA LANDSBURY.Watch the original, not this turkey."
2,Disappointing...considering the cast,"This movie is another classic example of what is wrong with so many Hollywood movies lately. They are all about flash and forget the substance. I picked up the Manchurian Candidate because Denzel Washington always delivers a watchable performance and because of the history of the original film.Although it was not boring, it didn't have the excitement, the edge-of-your-seat suspense that the original '62 picture had.The Manchurian Candidate is just plain dull. Never mind the original version -- this is not a remake as much as it is an adaptation so I judge it strictly on its own merits. However, it is so weak that it barely has its own merits. The story is slow and inconsistent and the directing is just plain heavy handed - focusing more on mood and music rather than story and plot. At one point about 15 minutes from the end credits all of the implications crystallize and the viewer can finally care - if they haven't given up completely."
2,Not as Good as the Original,"The original Manchurian Candidate, starring Frank Sinatra, is an excellent thriller, one that had me scared for months. I was looking forward to the remake. Unfortunately, while the film holds your attention for the duration, and is a worthy effort, the movie is eminently forgettable. The chills don't last.Meryl Streep does not play evil well. The insinuation of incest between her and her grown son is just embarrassing and takes away from the story.Stick with the original for a classic yet timely political conspiracy thriller."
5,Biodegradable,"The Seventh Generation Natural Laundry Detergent is ultra concentrated, tough on dirt and stains, non-toxic, biodegradable and hypo-allergenic. How often do you read all those items in one list?I have purchased bottle after bottle of this Lavender scented product. Now I look forward to doing the laundry. It is more like a Zen experience. The lovely lavender scent is much milder than regular harsh detergent scents and they have a matching Lavender softener.You may also notice this product cleans your clothes better and your skin will also notice the change. If you have any allergies to regular detergents, you might want to try this for a few months. You can also use less detergent, 1/4 of a cup is quite enough for most loads or you can use up to 1/2 cup.~The Rebecca Review"
2,Received Reconditioned Switch,"No instructions, plain white box marked RECONDITIONED. No mention of reconditioned in Amazons write up. Called customer service and was assured that it was a mistake. He sent me a return shipping label and reordered the switch. Received second switch, same thing.What gives Amazon?"
5,It's the bomb!,"When I bought this book I knew it was going to be good just by the look of it.Abby Hayes is an outdoor person,soon she finds out her best friend,Jessica is moving to Oregon for 3 WHOLE MONTHS!!!She agrees to do 1 of Jessica's jobs.So then...oops!I told you too much!Well,what are you waiting for? Go pick you up a book!!!"
4,Really good,"The litter box fits perfectly on the cage. It is bigger than it looks and it does have a whole so you can attach it to the cage, but it does not brings the lock, so I had to made one and glue the box so it doesnt moves."
4,More rapier wit from the gays...,"For fans of Dave White's blog, this book reads like his sassy posts about LA and pop culture. He has a way of peppering the most mundane observations with clever comedic one-liners that bitchslap you when you least expect it, like the punk-rock David Sedaris you'll never hear on NPR. For the uninitiated, this loose collection of essays only reveals a hint of his emerging talent. This reader is anxious for his next book: bigger targets await the wrath of his satire."
5,Beauty and Inspiration Abound,I am a beginner to Mosaics and could not have asked for a better book to begin my journey with. The pictures are awesome and so diverse that you get a real feel for the possibilities in the Mosaic Art form. The instructions are clear and easy to follow and the projects are great inspiration for anyone whether beginner or expert. Buy it!!! You will never be sorry.
5,Big Fun!,"Wow! This will add some flavor to your exercise routine. The movements are easy, really fun, and deceptively effective. Try it, you will like it."
5,Great,"This is fun, a little tiring at first if you aren't use to any exercise. In no time you feel good about doing some exercises no matter that they are for older people."
2,Spread eagle walking hard on hips. Seated resistance training should use weights not bands. Bands hard on wrists.,Spread eagle walking hard on hips. Seated resistance training should use weights not bands. Bands hard on wrists. Alot of emphasis on upper back.
2,Look like seconds,Extra glass on the bottle makes me think these were seconds. Painting is nice but the top section of glass bothers me. I didn't send it back because it will be in a cabinet where you really won't see the flaw.
4,"Nice Ring, Picture doesn't represent the real ring","This Ring is nice, the diamond is a lot smaller than the picture here, but I would recommend to read about the ""carats""[1] of the diamond so you can have an idea on how big it is...My fiance loves it, and here's[2] a *fuzzy* picture of the ring soyou can take a look to the real ring..[1]http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/jewelry//104-1175310-2652750?%5Fencoding=UTF8[2]http://www.gruponumar.com/~esanchez/wen_ring1.pnghttp://www.gruponumar.com/~esanchez/wen_ring2.png"
2,BAD tray design,"If you are just using the seat at the table, this booster is fine. However if you want to use it more as a high chair, look elsewhere. The tray is impossibly difficult to snap onto the seat and also hard to get off. The white top tray designed to keep the bottom tray clean is too easy to remove so the baby will just pull it off and make a mess. As a seat, it's OK as long as you are putting your child at the table and rarely using the tray with it."
5,An Enjoyable Collection,"I enjoyed this early collection of the origins of Supergirl, who is Superman's cousin. This is when comics had a meticulous continuity and strived to create stories that made sense to the readers. I reccomend this to those fans of the DC family. It makes a lovely gift to someone who remembers those days. It will leave you wishing for still more as it did me.The Supergirl stories are sweet-natured as is Supergirl herself. I look forward to seeing future volumes, hopefully some that will include the era of Kurt Schauffenberger's art.Buy this while you can."
1,Not my cup of tea,"Let me just start off by saying, I love genmaicha. I can drink close to 10 cups a day of it. When I saw all the great 5 star reviews for this tea and its a good price I decided to buy it... yuk! Its full of steams and the green tea leaves are just awful. The tea just did not taste right. I'm really disappointed, I don't know why anyone would give this tea 5 stars. I now have two 14 ounce bags of tea I don't like. I would not recommend this tea to anyone."
5,AT LAST AGAIN!,Can always count on Amazon.com for a reasonably priced item. Now how about getting in THE CHRISTMAS LIST with Mimi Rogers - have been waiting for this one for years. Can't find it anywhere.
1,Poor Quality DVD,"Studio: Miracle PicturesDVD Release Date: March 3, 20031. Poor video/sound quality2. Even worse DVD quality - does not play on my DVD player, gets frozen.3. No subtitles."
3,Lady of Burlesque,"I enjoyed this movie and Barbara Stnawyck, makes this movie.Supporting cast is good but without Stanwyck, it would be so, so.If you want the best copy of this movie, this is the one. (Image Entertainment)Very good sound and very good picture quality."
1,Blame the record company!,"I am reluctant to take on the noisome role of music critic, but I feel that I must write this review, lest the legacy of inspired madness which the great Vivian Stanshall has left us with should be further denigrated by this terrible album. It was written at a time when Viv was seriously ill and seriously intoxicated, not a combination which makes for inspired comedy. Vivian said in his own words that he would never have released the album. Unbelievably, a representative of Viv's record company broke into his home and stole the tapes while he was in hospital; they were then edited and released without his consent. At the time of his death he was working on a new Rawlinson End album which was provisionally entitled 'Sir Henry II' ('Sir Henry I' being 'Sir Henry At Rawlinson End'), a clear sign that Vivian Stanshall had disowned 'Ndidi's Kraal'."
2,Great book I just can not get past the pooping page :-(,I took my kids to the zoo and the kids LOVED the penguins exhibit as did I. I decided to get a couple of books for us to read about. I love the ABC and 123 penguins but the Busy penguins went a little too far with the famous pooping page. It was a little too graphic for me to take home to the kids. For those of you who have not read the book this page has a penguin with it's back turned and a clear view of its butt and poop shooting out of it. I found it a little discusting personally. Of course we all poop and so do animals but we should keep that a little more of a private affair and I certainly do not want to read about it and look at it in a picture book with my kids. If I wanted a potty training book that is what I would have purchased. I returned the book and will look for a poop-free book. :-)
3,graco evenflo tandem stroller,"This is a great stroller for your babies when they are little. But as they get to be a year old or up, its very hard to steer, the wheels are not sturdy for constant use and the back seat does not have a tray. If you have twins id think about getting a more sturdy stroller. Then again, you get what you pay for."
1,Not impressed,"We got it on clearance at Walmart, so I guess I can't complain too much. But now we can't sell it either and it's pretty much a waste. First time we used it the back wheel brake broke off. There's no tray on the back, which stinks for your second child. Difficult to steer, just not impressing overall."
4,"Good lifter, not a good rasp","I'm giving this product a 4 instead of a 5 only because it is advertised as having a rasp. Ummm, I'm no dummy but I wouldn't call this a rasp. I was expecting a some sort of a serrated or rough edge that would work well for rasping the edge of the drywall. Best I could find that might be a rasp was the straight, somewhat sharp edge. But, problem solved with a $5 drywall rasp from Home Depot. No harm, no foul.But all that being said, as a kicker style drywall lifter it worked great. I was able to drywall my entire basement by myself using this tool. Sure makes it a LOT easier to get that bottom edge off the floor with this tool. It's lightweight and appears to be strong. I didn't have the problem the other reviewer had with it breaking but I could see how it might if you put a lot of force on it. It appears to be made from cast alluminum which could snap. But, be careful and use it for its intended purpose and I'm sure it will do a good job for you."
1,All fluff - no substance,This DVD has almost no useful information other than advocating becoming one with our mystic selves. Very trite and superficial.
1,Group of evangelical Christians,"A compellation of works from many Christians who hate Islam and Muslims. Ibn warraq may claim to be secular humanist but that's a lie. Christianity today is on its last breath trying to survive using disinformation and lies. But as we can see, as people examine Christianity with an open mind, they will shun it like the plague.Billions and billions of dollars are spent to defame Islam and this is all they can come up with . There are even stories of missionaries trying to bribe Muslims with money position and women to leave Islam but to no avail."
3,Good but disappointed,"Warraq's 'Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out' does a reasonably good job of bringing to the fore the reality of Islam by the accounts of those who have decided to leave Islam. Both those who were born into a Muslim family, as well as those who chose to take up Islam not having been born Muslim. However it seems that not only is this a book about the refuting of Islam, but also seems to have the underlying ulterior motive of promoting an atheistic/agnostic view point. All of the 'Apostates' seem to take their refuge from Islam in either of the two camps. This seems strangely unbalanced. A recent program on Al Jazeera which consisted of several Imam's discussing the need for propagation of the Islam as taught and lived by Mohamed, bemoaned the fact that each hear 6,000,000 Muslims in the Middle East and Africa were converting from Islam to Christianity. But you would never know that from this book. Everyone turns to either an atheistic or agnostic postion."
3,Works great.....but not a spray,On effectiveness and price I would give this 5 stars. But the bingo blotter that it has as an application device is awful. If you are cat proofing wires under your desk it could take over an hour. Searched around the house for a non-toxic spray top and the job was done in a few seconds.
5,Beautiful Music and Nature!,"The music with the nature is beautiful! It is so beautiful it not only touches and relaxes my husband and I but our pet birds. Originally, the pet birds are the ones we purchased this for. They listen to the radio all day and in between they listen to CD's. Many times while the CD's are relaxing them, we are being relaxed too.This one is beautiful with both music and nature!"
1,Needs high volume collector,"My system is a Craftsman 1HP dust collector, probably too small to make this hood design work. It works better with the intake area restricted by 75%, but it still leaves a pile on the floor in the center of the hose connection. I use a Shop Vac 2 1/2"" wet nozzle with the squeegee removed and set on end - excellent design, especially for my weak system."
4,Excellent information on niacin,"I have hypercholesterolemia and have been reading about Niacin for years. Dr. Abram Hoffer discovered its cholesterol lowering effects in the early 50's and Dr. Parson's picked up where Dr. Hoffer left off and has more good information on niacin in this book than I've seen anywhere else. If you have elevated cholesterol, this is a must read.The information on niacin could not be more complete, but the limitations of the book are when it comes to cholesterol discussion. Dr. Parson's says diet doesn't matter, meat is okay, and vegetarians are not healthier, which flies in the face of all medical studies. I agree a low fat diet is not good, but avoiding meat helps prevent the cholesterol from oxidizing, which is when the trouble starts. Also, he doesn't really even mention anti-oxidants.If you want good info on niacin, buy this book! I think an excellent book to purchase as well to get the entire picture is ""The Antioxidant Miracle"" by Dr. Lester Packer."
5,A brilliant insight into Romel.,"Written by a british officer who fought and was captured by Rommel in the deseret. The author goes to all the human limits of reserch to find and interview anyone who ever knew Rommel personaly. He goes to great lengths to tell us the personality of Rommel and his impact on those who surrounded him. A MUST for any WWII historian or buff. If you have never read a book on Rommel before, Start with this one."
1,After the Fire,"I returned this book, I do not like poetry for every day reading. I ordered this book in error."
1,"Remakes don't make the ""History of Rock & Roll""","There is nothing quite like the original oldies, and what you have here are remakes. The original singers (to my knowledge) have redone these songs. And sometimes re-doing the song is worse than remastering (I speak of poor remastering-which does happen).These are some wonderful songs, especially Hitchin' A Ride, Nice To Be With You, Indiana Wants Me, etc., etc. But if you are not hearing the original sound, the sound that created the hit record, then it is merely a distraction to listen to it.So if you don't mind remakes and enjoy a different sound musically and vocally, then this is good. The voices appear original, but the sound, tone, phrasing, instruments are different.If you are like me and ONLY wish to hear the originals, then SKIP this......Rizzo"
3,I always want better,I always hope that these books will improve. This one is a marked improvement over the others plotwise.
2,"Oh, how the mighty have fallen","Laurell Hamilton is an excellent writer, so it's depressing that such talent is going to waste. The last two or three books have focused almost exclusively on sex. Sex, sex, and more sex. STOP IT! Laurell Hamilton seriously needs to get back to what attracted most of us to her books in the first place; a strong female character blasting the bad guys' heads off. Please, Ms. Hamilton, go back to writing about Anita as a detective and executioner, not a porno star."
4,Read all Anita,I loved this book. The only complaint I have is that Anita can't seem to make up her mind on who she wants to be with. I think she should end up with Jean-Claude he likes or loves her even with all her faults and I think she should accept Jean-Claude because of it. Richard needs to accpet his monster and stop giving Anita hell about how easy it his for her to kill. In that world it's kill or be killed and Anita knows this. Over all it's a very good book and the only problem with Anita is that she should have to think that just because she sleeps with someone that she should start to love that person to. If she's going to love someone it should be Jean-Claude and she should recieve the fourth mark and grow more powerful. Other than that this was a good book and I can't wait for her (LKH) 13th book.
2,Is Anita Blake losing her thunder?,"I was so excited to receive my copy of Cerulean Sins. Except for a hot sex scene with Jean Claude and Asher, this book was too tame and kind of boring. No exciting fight scenes, no other worldly [tail] whippings. Anita lost her thunder. I am so disappointed I could cry. That explains the 2 stars. I really should get a life."
3,A train wreck,"A friend and I race each other to see who can read the new book the fastest. This time he won and described the book as a train wreck. I did not understand until I had read it for myself.How much shi* can be packed into one weekend? Between raising the dead, fighting the adour (way too many times), stiring up the first vampire (can you say hi Buffy), vampire/police/pack/pard poltics, mental breakdowns and no sleep, no-one could survive this. Will I buy this one to add to my library, yes. But I prefer some of the earlier books where I could feel for the main charactures more."
2,Anita Does St. Louis,"This book has a little more plot than most of the other later Anita Blake books, but only a little.It's about half sex. Stale, repetitive sex at that, too. I can't recommend any of the recent Anita Blake books with a good conscious. Hamilton was never that great a writer, what made her books worth reading was the character: Anita Blake. But, now, it's only the same character in name only. There really isn't anything else recongnizable about her anymore."
2,Vampires don't use spellcheck,"This was a fun read. Great airplane-type stuff, although all the back history is a bit thick for someone (me) who has not read other entries in the series. And too much endless annoying talking about relationships. But the real problem for me is this book contains a truly appalling number of mistakes. It's riddled with typos, misspellings, incorrect punctuation and unintentionally incorrect grammar. I'm really very surprised it comes from a major publishing house; don't they employ people for the specific purpose of cleaning such things up? It may seem a small point, but after several chapters of this it becomes distracting, annoying, and detracts from the author's, well, authority. It makes the whole package seem juvenile and poorly produced. Shame on Berkley Books. (Now I just hope I didn't misspell anything in this...)"
4,another good one,"I think Laurell K Hamilton has done it again... Cerulean Sins, is a fantastic read and was very hard to put down. If you've loved any book in the Anita Blake series you are sure to enjoy this one. The only reason why I gave this book a 4 instead of a 5, was Hamilton came to an ending too fast, it was like she was writing and all of a sudden she realized she was coming to a page limit and had to end it soon. The vampire politics was very nicely played out, but the additional side of police and murders seems to be more of an addition to the story because it is expected not needed... I fully recommend this book to every Luarell K Hamilton fan."
4,who's the monster ?,"Anita's come a long way since we met her in Guilty Pleasures. Her moral high ground is not so very high anymore - some might argue she's even standing in a small hole she dug all by herself... Anita will do anything she had to do to help her friends, even if it means sacificing some of her own morals. But the way she's going, soon she won't have many morals left. Like she says herself: she's becomming a good little sociopath... But if you read them in the right order you understand why she's becomming what en who she is. It all seems so very logical at the time she makes her decisions. And she knows she's being really unfair to the men in her life. And yet they keep hanging on...Although the books changed a lot since the first one, I still love them, always looking forward to the new one."
4,Cerulean Sins,"Actually I would give it 4.5 stars if that had been an option. I have read every Anita Blake novel and have enjoyed them all albeit some more than others. I read this one in a day.Some of the back fill does slow the story, but not so its too distracting. Anita is more vulnerable in this volume and its kind of a nice change to have her not entirely sure of herself. She doesn't always have to be right, especially when she knows she's wrong, and that comes across in this book.I love the story-line with Asher. I have loved him since the start though, he's second only to John-Claude. I don't really get Micha but maybe that'll come too.I don't want to give the story away - read it for yourself. As always its more than worth it. Hope we see more of Asher and John Claude --- I didn't miss Richard and his angst at all."
2,Where's the story???,"The 11th book in the Anita Blake Vampire series seems like Laurell Hamilton is running out of ideas. The stories are feeling more and more like a daytime soap opera. She has to understand that a soap opera is on every day, but we only get a new Anita Blake book every year! It should be important and mean something - make it count. Anita's character seems to go along with the flow of everything happening around her, instead of making decisions for herself. Yeah, I enjoy the sex as much as anyone else, but not at the expense of a compelling story. I also think the author desperately needs an editor with the courage to stand up to her. What Ms. Hamilton has written in 500+ pages, could have easily been done in 200 or so. Note to Laurell - keep the action moving and tell an interesting story! Don't worry about quantity, worry about quality."
3,so-so but not terrible,"I think that Anita Blake as a character has grown up in this installment of the series. As her powers evolve so does Hamilton's characterization of Anita matures. I have been reading The Vampire Hunter novels since Gulity Pleasures and one of my biggest problems with Anita early on was her 'holier than thou' attitude.Though Hamilton's unique take on vampires and shape shifters is still engaging and fascinating, Cerulean Sins suffers from a story line that gets lost in too much stuff going on at once and villians that seem more annoying than menacing. I have to suggest buying a used copy or waiting until it comes out on paperback."
3,Not up to par,"I must say, that CS was a disappointment. You wade through a truck load of emotional hodge podge to get to nothing. The plot was incoherent, and there was no real character development. I feel that Anita is becoming such a weak character. She really is losing her sense of self. And it's just such a sudden illogical change. One moment she's superwoman and the next she's a weeping damsel in distress. The plot is getting so immersed in this emotional garbage and sex that it's just plane boring. It's abosolutely ridiculous! After plowing through a whole book of this in NiC, you would expect something spectacular, but no."
1,Three strikes and you are out,"OK, this is book 11 in the series and I am sure its starts to become taxing on the author to grow the story and character. Books 9, 10 and 11 have bored me to tears and frankly, the stories are reading like bad erotica and boring at that.Time to kill this series, or should I say ""execute it""."
2,disappointing,"Well, the book had all of the requisite Anita Blake plot point items. It's like she has a list - dead bodies, check. Police snarkiness, check. Vampire politics, check. Mystery, check. So she put the minimum amount necessary in for each required item, and then spent the rest of her pages on boring and pointless introspection. Nothing is better at the end of this book, and some things are much worse. The bones of a good novel are in there, but the way it's fleshed out, the character development, the action...Nothing hangs together. The times of day are all wrong. Going from one place to another takes too little time, or too much. It's like the editors just didn't care, or were too anxious to get the book on the shelves to insist on anything like a consistancy check.I know the author is capable of much better writing. I don't think I'll be buying her hardbacks until she returns to the level of quality she showed in Blue Moon and Obsidian Butterfly."
3,Go back to basics LKH,"Cerulean Sins has the same flaw as Narcissus in Chains: They both lack balance. Part of what I liked about the previous novels was the interweaving of the mystery/action/romance and paranormal. These last two books focus way too much on the last two of that list. Also, how did Richard become the guy to beDIS-ed? I WILL buy the next one, but I'll be wary."
3,"Good, not as good as before though","I pretty much tore through the early Anita Blake novels and enjoyed them immensely. Cerulean Sins was a bit of a disappointment for me. The graphic sex has been stepped up a notch and the mystery/thriller/story line component has been stepped down a notch. I still enjoyed it, but I hope the trend doesn't continue--graphic sex novels are a dime-a-dozen, good vampire thrillers are a much rarer commodity."
2,More sex does not mean a better story,"I hope that this is the last in the series and it seems to be. The Anita Blake series has been a wonderful ride and we believe in her world - a Laurell K. Hamilton speciality. However, as far as story arcs go - geez! Anita ends up as a succubus (she needs the sex kids or things go south), Jean Claude is losing his cool factor and poor Richard is down right suicidal.Then again, perhaps she is planning on writing another book. I just hope it's better than this one, because using explicit sex as plot points does not make for the best of stories."
4,Getting there -- ready for the next installment.,"I've read every single Anita Blake book since the first one, which came out when I was a sophomore in high school. I must say, as a graduate of a Catholic school, I'm certainly glad she wasn't having this much sex then! :-) Now that I'm older, I don't mind at all.A lot of people read this book and just saw the sex, but I seemed to notice a transition or a bridge. I like the addition of new ""warrior"" characters to draw the attention away from just using sex for power, and showing other power avenues. I think it can be a good change for the way the series has been going. I just hope it's really going there, and not into just more sex.Because, honestly, at this rate, Anita might run out of people to *be* with."
3,well...,"I love the Anita Blake series. However, and I've seen other people comment on this same thing, it's losing some of it's originality by becoming exactly like her Merry Gentry series. I like both series and don't mind the sex but the Anita Blake series started out as a strong woman who kicks (...)type of story and now it's more of a strong woman who is a (...)story. I wish she would move back away from it, although I don't see that happening with the direction these books seem to be going. It was nice to have the (...)kicking series and the naughty series as it showed different sides of her writing. I still like the book, but just be warned if you are looking for an action book that this has action, but alot of it isn't the type you are looking for."
2,I'm not sure I like Anita Blake anymore,"I am not a prude by any means and I love a good book. The first books in this series were good books (although Anita Blake was not always very easy to like). The last couple of books are nothing more than a most unlikable character having sex with anything that moves, and somethings that don't move! In one day she had sex every two hours and with complete strangers. And the descriptions are so graphic, they just are not nice to read. They just go on and on and on. Enough already!I enjoy the other characters, however it is difficult to read when she is just plain mean to the people who love her."
2,Disappointing,"Most recipes have more sodium than is good. And, it's not good source for daily meals for couples -- menu too limited."
1,DON'T BE FOOLED!!,"This is not Bomb Factory, the Japanese punk rock band. This is some unknown indie-rock British band who happens to have the same name. Do not buy this album if you are expecting Exciter or Deadly Silence Beach. You will be sorely disappointed.From what I can tell, this ""Bomb Factory"" isn't terrible. They sound like a garage band Killers-clone, but the three songs here all sound pretty much the same. Not what I was expecting at all when I found ""Bomb Factory"" on Amazon."
2,Disappointing!,"I usually love Jilly Cooper, especially her book, ""The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous"". I also stormed through ""Appasionata"", which was a great read. However, this book was not up to her usually great standards. The characters were unrealistically over the top and I didn't like anyone, except for the tortured Tristan (who was a bit too tortured) and Lucy (who was too nice and weepy). Everyone hated everyone, and as I got to the end, I didn't even care who killed Rannaldini. These people consisted on a diet of hatred, venom, bad sex and so much alcohol, I'm surprised people weren't being rushed to the hospital for alcohol poisoning.I will wait for her next book, but not with the normal breathless anticipation that I relished. To get the full Jilly Cooper effect, read ""The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous"" first. Then work your way to ""Appasionata"" and skip ""Score"" altogether."
4,This Is Hilarious,"This collar is pretty funny, it drives our dog nuts. I thought it was going to be bigger, like the size of the frilly parts, not the actual diameter of the collar. Still great."
4,Great DVD,"Had the poloroid one previously with battery problems and then plug-in cord problems. I wouldn't recommend the Poloroid at all. I like the size of this one so much. It's light-weight and easy. It's hard to find one with the battery these days, which is nice for flights. We've used the player a lot already. I have had the occasional stop on some bumpy roads, but not bad. I agree with others on needing another small bag to carry cords, etc. as the bag it comes with only holds the unit."
1,Not interesting or exciting,"I found this book to be lackluster and quite boring. The plot was tedious and overwritten. The book never drew me in, I never felt like I was in the story. In the end, I just wanted to be done with the book and forget I ever read it."
3,Canning,"Recipes were inadequate. Add more to the book. When I get recipe books to help preserve food, it helps if there are good o.e."
3,It works,Makes your mosin a bit tactical and a little bit practical. Nice to use at the range to have a few extra shells close buy to load up instead of looking all over the bench to see where your ammo rolled off to.
1,Beware of 'New Stereo Recordings',"This collection is largely made up of the dreaded ""new stereo recordings"" and NOT the takes that are the classics we rever.I don't know what sort of record industry shenannigans this reveals, but it would make a good atory."
1,crap,This has nothing to do with motorcycles except for the first couple of minutes. Bad acting all around.. do not waste your money!!!
2,Billy Ray's Mullet vs.the Bad Guys,"Want a movie that's a fun waste of time?Little or no plot?Plenty of explosions,shootings,and scantily clad women?Then ""Radical Jack"" is perfect for you.Billy Ray stars as Radical Jack,a former CIA man out to avenge his family's deaths.He fights for truth,justice,and the American Way with his fists,his muscles,his guns--and his mullet.The plot is needlessly complicated with the CIA,arms deals,war veterans,etc-but it makes for good dumb fun early morning viewing.Yay!"
2,Wasn't very helpful for what I needed.,"I have 7 antique/vintage fishing rods and none of them were in there. Also, the prices were separate from the descriptions so I couldn't tell what I was pricing."
5,I Loved This Book!!!!!!!!!,"I read this book in one day!! I read ""Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry"" in 8th grade as a class requirment and I loved it and I started looking for the sequals and prequals a couple of weeks ago. So far I like this one the best. Cassie Logan is 17 and still has a temper when it comes to segragation and one of the young white boys Jeremy Simms cousin Statler is setting eyes on young and beautiful Cassie Logan. an incident happens causing the Moe to flee to Memphis with the help of Cassie, Stacie, Clarence, Little Willie, and Jeremy Simms. On the way Cassie meets a very handsome man in a cafe........... Great book I highly reccomend you read it or get it for your child. Taylor is very good in expressing the hardships of the African American people during that time period."
1,Toilet Paper,"This book is the dumbest book, I ever read. I can't believe the dumbass lies in this book, and the attack on someone like James Angleton. This is a clear sign of our, once great nation in decline, when this jerk can bad mouth someone like Angleton."
3,"Good, but very one sided","All in all, the FBI book seems better. Both in accuracy (based on information confirmed in other books) and depth (this one doesn't get very deep). This book is a decent overview but really leaves the doors open for a lot of other reading on the subject. Information contained in books on the MI6 and the KGB (Sword and Shield) paint a somewhat different picture of some of the CIA's accomplishments. Suggest reading the Black Tulip for a semi-non-fiction read. Looking back I'm not all that happy with this book."
2,Feels great before it's washed!,"This is the first ""nice"" set of sheets that I've owned. Everything else comes from Walmart or is found in a Bed-in-a-bag set. I thought I would splurge on these sheets, never having slept on much more than 100 thread count. When I first opened up the package, they felt wonderful. Silky and as smooth as could be. I washed them right away on the delicate cycle and tumble dried on low heat as per directions. I took the sheets out of the dryer and they felt very familiar to me. They felt like your typical flannel sheets. That's the best way I can think of to describe them. They feel just like a flannel sheet to me. Needless to say, I'm not really impressed. I guess the other poster was right, you DO get what you pay for."
5,Great!,This toy is something I've wanted since these toys were released. I was so happy to see it on here for a great price. I received the package in great shape and very quickly. Highly recommend this seller!
1,Save your money...,"Buying this protector is nothing but a waste of time and money. I personally bought mine when I purchased my Ipod Mini. To start off, it is difficult to put on your ipod and when you do manage to get it on, it is nearly impossible to get rid of the ""screen bubbles"" formed but the protective lining. It collects dirt and makes your Ipod look like junk. It also prohibits your use of the clip that came with your Ipod. Take it from me, this product is one you should pass on. Try taking a look at some of the other ones...you will not regret it."
5,Greatest War Novel Ever Written,"This movie is drawn from the classic World War I anti-war novel by Erich Maria Remarque. Originally written in German and published in Germany as ""Im Westen nichts Neues"", it was banned by the Nazis and Remarque was forced to flee Germany. It has been called the greatest war novel ever written, an assesment I would agree with though I might call it more of an anti-war novel.Remarque knew where-of he wrote. He was in some of the fiercest fighting of World War I and was wounded five times, the last time very severely.The movie follows the book about as well as any movie can follow a book."
3,Great movie not so great dvd,Best World War 1 movie I ever seen. The DVD however should have been re-mastered. For video and audio quality expect nothing better than regular cable TV.
3,Great war Perspective,"Just like Full Metal Jacket, this film follows soldiers from Boot Camp through wartime. The young Ernest Borgnine is great."
1,This is a very poor made for TV remake.,This is a very poor made for TV remake. The origional is by far superior to this. Much of this one strays from the book and origional film. This one kind of glosses over the horrors of war which is what the book was about. Either reread the book or get the origional film.
1,Will not play....,"First, let me say I bought two sets of these three dvds by Johnson. The first set all worked but vol. 3 of the second set did not. This seems to be consistent with the poor quality of the Black Belt dvds. There are two martial art dvd companies out there that have very poor quality goods and Black Belt is one. Since the first set I bought worked I can tell you that Johnson's concepts and instruction are great... He is five stars all the way. Unfortunately, Black Belt tends to fall short too many times letting down the buyer and the folks that present their skills."
5,The Sirens of Ming Hai,"Reading this book was a true joy. The characters were believable, yet unpredictable. I enjoyed this book from start to finish, and the finish was.........captivating! Don't expect to start reading this book and then put it down."
4,Great Acquisition,"Wonderful practice, ideal for intermediate / advanced practitioners. Good flow and challenging postures.Just a remark, draw the attention to Jenn's Mudrás, she uses them, the class does not and there is no explanation for them."
2,"It may be a great practice, but....","I'm sure Jennifer Lynn is an accomplished practitioner and teacher, but for me her enthusiasm is so excessive that I can't even listen to her instruction. I tried to do this dvd several times and just couldn't stand her. So if there is anyone else out there who feels this way, you aren't alone. I bought this dvd because of all the glowing reviews and I finally threw it out because it actually put me in a terrible mood by section three. It is the first dvd I have tossed into the trash."
4,It Does What it Should,"It works fine - I'm not sure what I was expecting to justify the slightly higher price than the cheap one from the dollar store. It's dishwasher safe, so that's something."
4,Outstanding resource for researchers and graduate students,"This edited volume is an outstanding collection of several classic papers and many more recent, thoughtful and thought provoking papers. Covers a comprehensive set of methodological topics relevant to clinical research from the initial conception stage through design and analysis to write-up. Would make an excellent choice of text for a graduate seminar on clinical research methods."
4,Nice change,"I enjoy hearing Michael Kiske's voice in his own style. Helloween tried to capitalize on that fact that Kiske sounded similar to Geoff Tate of Queensryche, who were popular at the time they recruited him as the their vocalist."
3,Lots of alternatives,"Just go to one of the big boxes and get 12x24 filters for less than $10. 3M makes nice filters. I got some 24x24 filters and cut them in half, two for the price of one. Use duct tape to form a edge on the cut end."
2,Choppy writing,"I'm usually not too picky about the material I read. As long as there's a great story line and depth to the characters, I can manage. However, it's very hard to look beyond the short, choppy writing style used here. If the idea was to make this a book for young adults, then it succeeds at criticizing their intelligence."
5,An Important Piece of Literature !,"As an educator I highly recommend this book to young and old alike. The main characters Casper and Brendan face incredible odds in their relationship and how they deal with those odds will not cease to amaze the reader. Mr. Roeder has given us a love story that at times is difficult to handle,(I had to put the book down several times and catch my breath), and yet so believable. Gay and straight youth and adults alike would benefit from this story that touches upon some very important issues.This is my first read from this author, I now want to read the other books in this series entitled ""Gay Youth Chronicles"" and I will. A definite five star read! Thank you Mr. Roeder for your wonderful story, your insight, and your ability to create such heart-warming characters. I look forward to reading all of your past and future work."
4,Fairly nice,These pants are fairly nice for the price. I paid $9.00 shipped.I don't think I can find pants for that price locally.
2,not a good quality blades,These dont do a good job. Not recommended and not worth the money being charged.I am surprised of some poor quality dewalt tools and blades. I am going gradually over to Bosch and Makita.
4,Good Value,"When I ordered these saw blades it was because my compound miter saw needed a new blade and money was tight. The combo pack of 10"" blades from Dewalt was considerably less expensive than most of the other blades that I know to be good ,so I was not expecting to have the best quality cuts. Boy I couldn't have been more wrong... These blades are great and believe me you will not be disappointed at all. They cut smooth without any strain on the motor of the saw and with virtually no tear out. What a Value!!!!"
3,Great show/poor DVD quality,"This DVD is a must for all die-hard Naz fans, because the performance of this 6-piece incarnation of Nazareth is outstanding. Some video pieces and road documentaries are also interesting. But the quality of DVD is beneath criticism. Well, the sound is, let's say, satisfactory, but the video is very bad - it's dark with faded colours. So now you are warned!"
3,"if you remember ALL the songs, then it's a 5-star review.","I simply bought this for the track ""One Foot In Front Of The Other"". after being reminded of it during a Family Guy episode, I couldn't get the song out of my head.The other tunes are good, but just not as memorable - to me. So, check out the audio samples and listen for yourself. :)"
4,Nerds in Paradise Soundtrack?,"Does anyone know if there is an existing ""Nerds in Paradise"" soundtrack? I am actually searching for the last song that plays during the credits. I can't seem to find it, or any information on the soundtrack anywhere. CAN SOMEBODY HELP ME??? I'd really like to know the name of that last song! Nerdtacular!"
4,A fun version of Pride and Prejudice,"Bride & Prejudice is a fun version of Pride and Prejudice. The producer is Gurinder Chadha who produced ""Bend It Like Beckham.""In the movie, the ""Bennet"" sisters are Indian and Darcy is a rich American. The plot is roughly the same as the original, but with lots of dancing and singing. My wife really enjoyed some of the dances.We liked the movie so much we bought the DVD."
3,Silly - but addicting,"Good Bollywood for clueless Westerners. The usual improbable mass song-&-dance scenes, but close enough to Austin to follow the plot & characters. Absolutely GORGEOUS color, costumes, scenery, music, etc. Confusing at first, but it sure does grow on you, & the music rapidly becomes familiar & lots of fun. Very enjoyable. Wish I knew of more like this."
2,Bootleg,"I bought this DVD (Bride & Prejudice) because I liked the vibrant colors, but when I watched this DVD, the colors kept constantly fading, making me think that this was a bootleg..."
1,Swearing,"This video has many severe instances of taking God's name in vain. Purposely uttering God's name in vain as if it were a swear word, especially Jesus Christ's, is an attack upon Christianity and civility."
3,Thank goodness for then fast forward button,"Jane Austen's classic ""Pride & Prejudice"" gets the Bollywood treatment in a rollicking update by Director Gurinder Chadha who brought ""Bend it Like Beckham"" to the screen creatively modernizing Austen's timeless story. Reigning Bollywood Queen Aishwayra Rai portrays Lalita Bakshi, the headstrong independent sister in search of Mr. Right while maintaining her independence. Her foil is American hotel magnate William Darcy played by Martin Henderson.Just as you get into the storyline, suddenly the cast breaks out into song, reminiscent of ""Grease."" It takes awhile to get into it, and might have some viewers reaching for the fast forward button. Overall, it is an enjoyable timeless story."
1,terrible!!,"I really love everything about BOLLYWOOD films and adore the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice, so I was really looking forward to watching this film. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a huge disappointment. It has a lot of music and color, but the acting is so bad, and the abrupt interruptions of song and music so annoying, that they produce an unwelcome mess of a movie. I realize some serious messages were to be transmitted, but it perhaps tried to do too much, and failed at everything miserably. If you want an entertaining movie with a good message, try Lagaan directed by Ashutosh Gowariker or Water and Earth by Deepa Mehta. Don't waste your time with Bride and Prejudice."
4,A treat for the eyes and ears,"I'm a fan of all things from India (saris, chai, masala, chapatis, Bollywood, etc.) so I knew that I would enjoy this movie. After all, Bend it Like Beckham is one of my favorites. Bride introduces you to a loving family made up of four beautiful daughters, a matchmaking mom and dutiful, doting dad. You will feel the characters emotions as they fall in love, dance, sing, suffer from broken hearts, and revel in family. The colors will dazzle you and the beauty of India and her people will amaze you."
2,"awful, cheesy...poorly written","oh my...i was shocked and disappointed when i saw this film. after seeing MISTRESS OF SPICES and being a fan of bollywood and indian films, i was dismayed at how horrible this film was. had it not been for aishwarya, im sure this movie would could have a B rating.the script was poorly written and the acting was bad. the costume design and colors were pale (not really representative of bold bollywood colors), i didnt care much for the music, and it was just plain cheesy.i am surprised by all these great reviews...in fact, that is why i bought the movie...*sigh*...lesson learned.overall, this film was a disappointment. i would not recommend it, unless you like a bad script and poorly acted films."
3,asdflkjasd asdfjoasnoa sodfn,"this is a test and should show up on the website, but who knows - maybe it's not gonna work... as usual..."
3,Calorie-free Fluff,"I gave this three stars because I didn't not like it. That said, I'm not sure that I actually liked it. I liked that it is based on Austen's P&P and I find that I cannot resist Austenesque pastiche. I was intrigued with an Indian setting, being curious to see how Bollywood would interpret her work. The actors were good and I liked the blend of manners. I would have liked it better without the awkward musical injections that afflicted the film sporatically. The dancing that was germane to the plot was well executed and enjoyable. (The ""Indian MC Hammer"" line was witty as well!) The ""musical"" lyrics were lame and none of it added to the quality of the film nor advanced the plot. Which was pretty superficial. There wasn't time to dig into any tension between the characters who were supposed to shadow Austen's characters. I didn't hate it, because it was a diverting bit of fluff and the Indian infusion into the film was unique. Two and a half stars."
4,"Wonderful direction, good entertainment","This is a brilliant presentation of not so powerful storyline about typical Indian culture. Movie is as colorful as Indian weddings itself. Gurinder Chadha, the director, has talent to do justice to the characters through good scene sequences and dialogs.I think the second downside of the movie was that the subtle mixture of dance numbers with the core story in the early part of the movie. I liked the typical mom under the pressure of getting her daughters married, comic dialogs, very well balanced and paced story, good entertainment.Very well recommended."
3,Addicting,"This was my first introduction to the existence of Bollywood. This is not Bollywood it is an American/British film but many of the actors are from the Mumbai industry. The music is infective and the idea behind the movie is good. However, the acting is not so great. Aishwarya Rai in particular she has never really struck me as good in roles where she has to be negative. Her anger at Darcy seems more childish than justified. Perhaps its because she is contrasted with the American/British group that it comes off that way in this movie. I like her in most Bollywood movies and she is stunning but still, something just doesn't flow. However, I did buy both a soundtrack and the DVD so obviously I got over it."
1,wrong part right box,right box wrong part i had to buy return it to local auto parts store and lie and say they sold it too me
5,Jack Black Nailed it,"Its as if somebody said, ""What if we make a movie similar to ROCKY but lets have the main character be a Mexican Wrestler and lets make it really funny.""I get the feeling Jack Black loves the Mexican culture and the style of John belushi.If you like to cheer for the underdog and you need a good laugh .. this one is for you.All the little details in the movie help to make it funny. Everything from his motorcycle to the signature of a love letter. In several parts of the movie, unexpected funny (yet honest) comments are said that will make you laugh.Undestand .. I am not a Jack Black fan. And I prefer a movie with a little nudity. But I'm glad I have this one in my collection."
4,nacho best movie!,So I love jack black and think he is an amazing actor and sooo funny! SO I bought this movie thinking that this one would be great! But it kind of let me down! it had its funnier moments and then not so funny moments! I would have rather not bought this movie! It was a let down! So if ur looking to buy this one my advise RENT it first!
1,Boring,"watched this film recently&didn't find anything funny at all. Jack Black just basically plays the same character in all of his films. now he has a moment or two here&there,but this mess never gets off the ground. no chemistry between the actors&Actress poor writing&no direction whatsoever. this film just wasn't funny&didn't make any sense to me. another example of a Over-hyped film."
4,Jack Black is perfect for this story!,"Heartwarming story - plenty of comedy - great sidekicks! If you liked School of Rock, then you will like Nacho Libre."
2,Lame Libre,I like Jack Black as a actor. But Nacho Libre is as dull as dull can be. I wish I saw this at the movie. Never in a million would have purchased the DVD movie. The gags are lame and plot is stale. Pass over this zero and purchase a hero like School of Rock.
2,sux,"I usually like Jack Black, but his constant mugging and the beyond silly plot line really turned me off in thids film."
2,"Funny premise, annoying execution","I watched the movie with an anti-Jack Black bias. Friends had told me how funny I'd find the movie, so I got it. The premise sounded great - a monk turning to lucha libre (Mexican pro wrestling) to feed orphans. First 30 minutes are hilarious. The next 30 Jack Black gets annoying. By the end you can't stand him anymore. Pretty much ruined a great concept.I'd say I should have known better, but I really did."
2,I'm sorry if you expect more,First off I must say I am not a Jack Black hater. I think he has had numerous good movies to his credentials. This movie is not one. Trying to pull off the Mexican thing was a joke onto itself. When I tried to endure watching this movie I began to get a sinking feeling. The type of feeling that comes when you realize you are wasting precious time in your day. This movie more than lacks in laughs. It also lacks in storyline. Seemingly taken from a terrible Mexican soap opera and strewn out for 90 minutes this movie only has favor because of it's star. Although as we all know stars can obviously bomb from time to time. For me this movie was a major bomb. You may feel differently watching this movie but for me it feels like a waste of a video rental and hopefully not a mistake I will make again.
2,Messed up!,"Though the actual DVD's condition was fine, the case it came in was in terrible condition and I threw it out (the case not the DVD). I don't know what could have caused that kind of damage to the case but I'm going to guess it was retreived from the bottom of a muddy river. This was listed as ""good"" condition although being used. I would say they don't know what that word means."
1,Sooooo Bad,"I took my 14 yr old grandson to see this and not only did I think this movie was bad, so did he. I think it should get a Razzie award for worst movie of the year. I wouldn't recommend renting and definitely not buying this movie."
1,A poorly edited book.,"This book was so poorly edited that I could hardly make it through the story. After a few chapters, I couldn't stand it any longer so I took my pen and made corrections to add flow to the story. It was a terrible tragedy, one of which we will never have any sensible answers for, but for David and his story, justice would have best been served by a professional writer."
4,Don't Get Hosed !!,"This is an excellent Dust Collection Hose. It does measure a consistent 4"" and always fit easily over the connection fitting. It is somewhat flexible and very rigid, but will not coil back into itself. This might be a problem if you move your equipment back and forth.The other hose options are a Clear Hose, which allows you to see any possible clugs and air blocks in the DC system. And there is a 50 foot coil hose, which is not as rigid, but it is sturdy and it will coil back into itself, allowing for the movement of machinery.I used all three in my DC system. The clear hose where large particles would be generated (lathe, bore machine), the 10 foot rigid hose in areas that would always remain fixed in location. And the 50 foot coil hose (cut up, of course) on machine that I move back and forth from the wall to the garage floor. I don't have endless space in the garage for all the ""needed"" equipment I have to use.All three hoses work just fine, no problems, no issues."
5,"Excellent for fans of Sleep, old Neurosis, or early Godflesh","IT IS I emerged from the ruins of another great band, ASBESTOSDEATH, who released one killer 7"" of amazing sludgy, misanthrophic doom before calling it a day, and ""Evolve"" takes up where AbestosDeath stopped. ""Evolution"" is a damn powerful CD. Easily eclipses anything Godflesh or Neurosis has produced in the last few years in sheer power. I think the most apt description would be Godflesh's first (s/t) LP mixed with ""Master Of Reality"" era Sabbath, with Neurosis' 'apocalyptic dirge' quality throughout the songs. Dwell really dropped the ball on promoting this one - if this were to come out on Relapse tomorrow, these guys would be huge. That said, track it down and buy it - particularly for you fans of Godflesh, Neurosis, His Hero Is Gone, and Tragedy."
2,Would have been great- if it were accurate.,"I've been reading this book (and using it as a main reference point for a thesis paper) when I noticed a few date and fact discrepancies. This book states things that are completely different from dozens of other sources I have, and maybe some of them are right, but I know, without a doubt that a few of them were wrong. And I just noticed one isolated incident, but if one error is there, I don't feel I can trust the validity of the rest of the book."
1,incorrect item description,Item delivered was incorrect to posted description.Listed as 37906-90 clutch hub bearing 1990 - 1997 harleyreceived a shifter shaft bearing - i contacted sellerseller blamed amazon for errorasking for a full refund
5,Perfect for kids,Another present for our 1 yr old daughter. She loves this show for some reason and we have no problem letting her watch it once in a while because it teachers excellent lessons about good behavior and were hoping theyll soak in.
2,Don't hate the Pajanimals,"If you have seen Goodnight Pajanimals, this video is about 10 steps backwards. If youve never seen the Pajanimals, it may be okay. My son loves the music and Meet the Pajanimals has more chatter. Goodnight Pajanimals runs song to song which is better for our household. Plus the songs are more developed and better quality in Goodnight Pajanimals. Skip this one and head over to Goodnight Pajanimals."
5,Proxim Orinoco 11a/b/g Combo Card Gold,It worked out of the box and has worked since. A very reliable unit and easy to set up.
4,American Country Furniture Treasure,"Drawings of a woodworking shop are excellent, as is all the art work rendered in pencil. A treasure for colonial history interests and those who like working with wood."
2,It was nice for a short time.,Mine didn't last very long (2-3 years) but at first it was great. I tried everything to fix it but can't figure out why.ProsLight is a nice touch even in bright kitchen.Grinds evenly.ConsDifficult to adjust coarseness.Takes 6 AA batteries.
1,MUI Pepper Grinder,I had to send the grinder back due to not working properly and not having the bottom cover for the grinder. I was disappointed because this was for a birthday gift and it was not working and missing a part. I did not order another one.
4,Works good!,The pepper comes out fairly fast which is good for cooking and adding pepper to dishes with one hand. Sure beats the manual grinder types of mills. I wish the pepper chamber was a little larger but it is an okay size.
2,Not Fine,"I bought this electric mill because I often have one hand involved in prepping a piece of meat when I need the salt and pepper. Shaking out some sea salt is easy with one hand, but grinding pepper needs both hands clean. The problem with this device is that the ""fine"" grind is not so fine, with some larger chunks passing through. Peugeot makes the best mills, and are the only ones to buy. I recommend this electric mill for arthritic seniors who like big chunks of pepper in their food."
5,Great To Use Item,"I gave this as a gift to my daughter-in-law. Then I decided to purchase one for myself. I have never thought about wanting or needing an electric peppermill before, and now I don't think I could be without it. I would definitely recommend it to all."
1,Terrible,"Initial impression was awesome but grinder wore out (6) AAA batteries in ~ 2 weeks - second set of batteries same...literally, through it in the garbage"
3,Good for kids,"I grew up watching this series, and fell in love with Batman because of it. The moment I saw a preview of the pages for Nightwing and Harley Quinn (my favorite characters) I rushed to order this. However, I was a bit disappointed. I'm used to the ""Ultimate Guide to ---"" Books and was expecting this book to be just as detailed. It is very thin, and not very specific. This book is great for people and kids who know very little about the series and want to get acquainted. For true fans, its not even necessary. Only major characters are covered. I would have been more impressed if a character like Rupert Thorne's accomplice Candace would have gotten a page. I don't see why not, she appeared in multiple episodes. However, in this book, Rupert himself only get a paragraph on the ""Other Villians"" page. An episode guide would have also been nice. The most you get here is a list of where each major character first appeared. I hope a more detailed book will appear in the future."
3,Mexico - a very mysterious place,"I was a little disappointed in Reading ""Mexico"". I was hoping to read about the ancient peoples of Mexico and what their daliy lives must have been like as well as their history, ways of life, beliefs, etc.. however this book was mainly focuses on archeological excavation sights and the articfacts and goes into great detail of the finds. This is all good and actually very informative for those interested in archeology alone. The book occasionally does touch on the Peoples themselves. Also, it is written in a very dry and sometimes dull and a high-brow manner which was also a turn-off to me. I recommend it though for the purpose of the many illustations and photos (the most interesting parts) and a must read for those interested in archeology."
5,Amazing and strong woman!,"Carmen Bin Ladin is an amazing and strong woman to write her story. After September 11th and the war that followed, so many books have come out about Islam and the Middle East.The books have ranged from attacks on Islam to support of Islam and everything in between. What Carmen Bin Ladin has done with her story is show us the life of one woman in that world. How can we deny her story when it is hers?I read this book in one sitting. I felt for Carmen as she began to realize the man she loved, married, and had children with could no longer be her husband. How hard that must have been for her. But what a truly loving and strong mother to give her daugthers what their female relatives in Saudi Arabia and women in general in the Middle East will never have: freedom to be women."
2,Not as fascinated as other reviewers here,"I got this book primarily to see how Carmen bin Ladin would view the society of Saudi Arabia, since she was of a more ""westernized"" background. And of course, I wanted to see how she felt about being part of the bin Ladin clan, particularly after 9/11/01.While the book wasn't poorly written, it was in places tough going for me because it seemed like she focused so much on her wealth and spending habits, her house, etc. I think this flaw was picked up by national reviewers of the book.I'm not that ignorant of Islamic culture, but would have liked to learn more about it. The book was an ""ok read"" but maybe my expectations were a bit higher than what the book delivered."
1,Bin Laden's sister-in-law,"This is an extremely intelligent, insightful, humane book. Its author, part Swiss & part Iranian, fell in love with a young Saudi without realizing what her marriage to him with involve, in the way of sacrifices of personal freedoms. The full impact fell slowly, as his society itself took strides backward. Finally, he had changed enough, in ways that threatened the happiness & freedom of her daughters, to lead her to break with him. That one of his many half-brothers turned out to be THE Bin Laden adds to the fascination of this book."
1,Is this space suppose to be a book review or what?,"I thought that this space was to show what do we think about the Book, not about Islam or Saudi Arabia, and just for those who believes that Carmen Bin Ladin is a clever woman who had just created more and more enemies because of her ""Honesty"", i would like to ask you? Have you ever been to Saudi? Have you ever Read the Qura'an....??? ""Inside the Kingdom"" is not a Holy Book, Even Holy Books depend on Logic and Reason....but you know what! I blame Amazon.com People who made this Site becomes a silly Chat room..."
3,An unveiling of women's roles in Saudi Arabia,"Carmen Bin Laben's book is an insightful look at life for women in Saudi Arabia. The book provides an insider's view of life in this Arab nation beyond what the news media or other reports might disclose. Carmen narrates just how much in conflict the thoughts, traditions, and religious life of Saudi Arabia are with those held in Europe or the United States. As a male reader, the book was slow in parts because of the ongoing references to her motherhood and attachment to her children. The book also enticed the reader with a glimpse of her infamous brother-in-law, Osama, but never fully delivered any insights beyond what might be gleaned from other writing about him. Overall, a worthwhile read for understanding the life of women in this Arab nation. The reader will find Bin Laden's book of more value if they have read an Introduction to Islam prior to undertaking her story."
4,Entertaining,"I have enjoyed reading this book although not quite sure if its all true, nevertheless its worth reading."
1,Disappointing,"National Geographic is well known for its pictorial brilliance, and this film doesn't lack in that area, but I made the mistake of not considering what it cost to gain the access required to make it. A little more journalistic independence and integrity would have made for a more honest portrayal in a least some cases. I found the gratuitous anti-Americanism and hypocrisy a little hard to swallow. Nice visuals though."
4,A New Energy,"It is rare in contemporary fiction to find a truly unique voice. There are more writers and publishers of fiction today than anyone can keep up with, and considering that much of it sounds exactly the same, why should one even try? Well, now there's a reason. Lee K. Abbott writes with a new energy, a sustained vitality, and his work carries an importance most cookie-cut contemporary work lacks. He has a filled bag of characters and situations, and he's got the raw writerly talent to make them interesting and believable. Any student of fiction or avid reader should find a copy of all of his books."
3,A curiosity,"Although this film has some curious similarities with the real life of 2 of its major actors ( Harrison and Palmer ) it's not really good enough to merit serious attention otherwise. The plot is very B movie and melodramatic and the acting by modern standards pretty wooden. The true relationship between Harrison and his lover is fatally never fully described, though this is more the fault of prevailing social censorship than anything, with the consequence that Palmer's dogged devotion to her husband appears merely conventional. A pity because there was the chance of a really good movie here. A case for a remake?"
4,Excellent guns for Lara Croft costume,"I bought these guns for my wife Lara Croft costume and they are great. I just painted a little big with some metallic silver color to make it look like the guns that Lara carried in the movies. They also work good, my son play with them almost everyday in the backyard."
3,Feels cheap,It may look nice but its made with cheeeeeaaaaap plastic. Barely shoots .20 bbs and the .12 fly straight up. Makes for 3 minutes of fun.....
5,The Best,"I love these shoes! They fit well and are super comfortable.They are great for people with high arches,and are the only shoes I've found that let me forget that I have plantar faciitis."
2,Jumbo Rusty,These knives are very large; the pictures don't convey how big. They look like they would cut through massive steaks well. I can't say how they actually cut because they arrived covered in rust and I am returning them.
5,"The Kissing Hand, Couldn't love it more","I got this book for my nephew ""to give"" to my sister for her first Mother's Day. He is still way too young to be going to school yet, but he does go to daycare. It is definitely more of a gift for her now. Something that she'll be able to read to him and think of while she is at work. She and her husband are taking a trip for a friend's wedding in the fall and she has already talked about how hard it will be to be away, but I think she'll think of him and this book and it will bring a smile to her face. It's a book that will grow with them for when he starts school. Can't wait to give it to her. I think she will love it as much as I do."
1,Bad shipping,"I ordered this book for a class on the 11th with 2 day shipping... and on the 20th it has yet to be shipped. As I ordered this from amazon, and not an independent seller, I expected to get it in the time frame estimated, as the book is in stock. If it is not shipped within the next day, I plan to cancel my order."
2,Watch out for their customer service,"The product worked nicely - easy to set up and use, nice picture and sound. But I purchased this portable DVD player in August. Within a month I had to send it back for repairs, as the power connection and headphone connection jacks were loose. I was lied to three times by the customer service department who said my unit shipped and then it turned out it didn't. By the time I receive the supposedly new unit, I will have been without it for nearly 2 months because of their poor customer service. Watch out!"
2,Get the extended warranty,"This item was so new last year, and hard to find, that I wasn't able to read any reviews. The unit died on us one year and one week after purchase - in the middle of a 17 hour car trip (I have an 8 year old boy). My parents are on their second Mintek DVD unit because the first one lasted only a few months; it was still under warranty. The screen on ours no longer works - kind of an expensive CD player... I will be buying a different brand next time as I don't beleive our problems were just a fluke. Up until this time, however, we have had no problems with it and it has worked just fine."
1,beware,"i got this dvd player and while it is cool, when it works i have had to exchange it 4 times at the ft myers,fl. best buy store. I hate it when the people at the return counter know you by name because you are constantly returning the same product. I finally made them open the package and try three dvd's right there in the store"
4,Not bad for the money,I bought this player and the only problem is the paint chipping of but picture is graet and sound is great
4,AWESOME,Wonderful!! This story will tug at your heartstrings from beginning to end...and show how amazing faith is! Great summer read.
2,slippin and a' slidding,"I used both types of band clamps- steel band clamps and wire band clamps- with the ribbed hose in my dust collection system.The steel band clamps slipped more, were harder to control going on and didn't seat as well as the the wire band clamps"
2,Too Much $ Need to Unplug,"Too much $ - too much unplugging. Works great in the Dark, but stays on during day! Always on during the day must unplug. Must take an awful lot of day light to turn this thing off! Works great at night - other than it stays on too long after no motion. Too expensive and too much hassle to unplug during the day."
4,DOES THE JOB,"This movement activated light works every time. It is activated only when the room is dark. It is nice and bright, giving enough light to find what you are looking for in that room without turning on the overhead light."
4,Works exactly as I hoped,"I have it in a hallway and the motion sensitivity is good. Perhaps wish there was something to adjust the length of time it stays on, but this is not a major issue."
1,Poop.,Poor Excuse For A Back Pack.It's A One Inch Zipper That Has A Pocket Only Capable Of Holding A Few Pennies.The Product Description Should At least Provide This Little Detail If It Could Provide Any Real Product Details At All.Thank God I Have Experience In Fixing Plush Back Packs With No Pockets.
4,A great story,This was my first book by Jack Higgins and it certainly will not be my last. I read it in two days while on vacation and enjoyed it very much. Jack really can tell a great story without a lot of filler. This story has action and romance mixed in with the rich history of the ending of The Civil War and the beginning of the Fenian Rebelion in Ireland.
3,Higgins in History is Plausible If Not Entirely Successful,"Set in Ireland in about 1865, Higgins gets the tone largely correct and doesn't trip too much over Zeitgeist anachronisms (though one could quibble on that point). The story takes forever to pick up -- like about three-quarters of the way through -- but when it does it becomes a good ride -- and a good read. And Higgins does an awful job of cleaning up after himself at the end (not to ruin it, but what happens to all the real estate?). Oh, well. Made the miles pass by in its Recorded Books incarnation. There's lots of better Higgins out there."
1,Absolute Hazzard!!!,Buying this toy is a death trap for your bird!String was injested and created an abcess which caused a hemorrhage!!!Feet get caught easily!Do not buy!!!!
1,Great picture ...BUT,"Purchased the mintek last year for Christmas...worked great for awhile but after six months the picture disappeared...no picture, just sound...take in for repairs and was told that was a common problem with Mintek and that it would be more to fix the player than to buy a new one...I am purchasing a new player but defintely not a Mintek!!"
1,Beware Buyer,"I bought this item but when I received it and turned it <br />on it did not work, im just glad that target took it back and credited my account. thanks target<br /><br /><br />"
1,Seizes up and broken volume,"I'm on my second one, after returning the first after 2 months. Both have seized up and quit running after an hour or 2 of use. The volume has also quit working after just 8 months of not much use. I do not recommend this unit."
1,I hate to even give this 1 star - 5 Weeks to Fix It ??????,"I purchased this as a gift. Christmas day we had to call Mintek. It seized up. The tech lady said ""just take your finger and slide the optics back and forth a few times... that usually fixes it.."" Well.. I'm no genius on laser optics and all the gearing involved, but that does not sound like a great ""fix"". I have been on the phone with these folks numbers of times. It continues to seize up, refuse to turn on and assorted other problems. Now I have sent it to them to replace. Mintek lady calls me and says they just received it and will send it back in (5) FIVE weeks. I yelled ""put a new one in the mail and send it."" No... evidently it comes in with a ""Batch"" and can only go out with a ""Batch"". Evidently Mintek only ships stuff out every 5 weeks of so. I have visions of young Chinese with their fingers on the optics sliding them back and forth....Bottom line... If you have a choice. Choose something else!!!"
4,Romantic Suspense,I enjoyed this book. It was my first Elizabeth Adler book. It was maybe a little more romance than I normally like in my suspense books. But I did still enjoy the book.It takes place in Boston. Harry Jordan is a cop from a wealthy background with an adorable dog named Squeeze. He is on the case of a serial killer. The killer is attacking young women and raping and murdering them. But one of his victims does not die at the scene. They get a partial description of the killer from the victim and the the witnesses who scared him off. Harry takes this drawing to Mallory Malone. She is the host of a show similar to America's Most Wanted. He needs her help to catch the killer. But she acts strange when she sees the drawing. Something from her past maybe? Sparks appear between Harry and Mallory. And the 2 of them must join forces to catch the killer.
4,Now or never,"I read this book several years ago, but it's one I would read again. I enjoyed itAll her books are very readable."
3,"Adler turns up the heat in her best since ""Peach""","Elizabeth Adler turns it up a notch in her thrilling ""Now or Never"" set in the Boston area. Detective Harry Jordan tries to find who has been killing female college students, and he decides to try and get Mallory Malone, a tough yet secretly vulnerable crime show host to help him nap the killer. They first cannot abide each other, but find themselves falling passionately in love with each other, and boy, is this novel steamy. Mallory is one of Adler's best heroines to date, and I like Harry, who became a cop in spite of his old-money wealth. Good mystery, but it is wrapped up a little too convineatly as the killer has a secret connection to Mallory."
4,Great read...kept me turning the pages with anticipation.,"This is a great book. The two story lines keep the reader coming back for more. The story only gets better when the two story lines merge. The villian, cunning and quick, is every woman's worse nightmare and both the hero and heroin are realistic people. Great work! I can't wait to read the next one."
1,Junk,"I would have thought that ""Natural Bodybuilding"" means bodybuilding without chemicals, including exotic supplements. But various participants in this book describe substantial supplement routines, including one fellow who says he took (at date of writing) androstenedione and a staggering 453 grams of protein daily(!!!). Another contributor describes Cort-Bloc; yet another talks about taking effervescent creatine, insulin mimickers, androgen precursors, HMB, etc. This is ""Natural""???Too much of the bodybuilding industry rides on profits made from pitching exotic substances whose long-term effects on human beings is unknown. The hard reality is that truly natural bodybuilding will not make you look like the full-time fitness models (who always look vaguely ill to me), unless you have incredible genetic gifts.Save your money."
3,Ironman mag readers avoid.,Not a bad book on natural bodybuilding but if you have read Ironman magazine this book is really nothing new. And it contains a lot of pictures of bodybuilders that are oviously not natural.
2,Swan Lake is not Firebird/Petrushka,The item I ordered & paid for was The Firebird/Petrushka Suite by Stravinsky. The item supplied was Swan Lake by Tschaikovsky. The Swan Lake performance was of a high quality but was not what I ordered. The two attempts to have this corrected have failed. Consequently I am disappointed.
5,"Inspirational, informative, intriguing. Heart-wrenching!","Presents comprehensive thoughts by detailing to the reader the life, events, emotions and challeges ever present in the life of Christ. Attention is given to detail as the author answers theological questions that seem to be present in todays society. This book, read with an open mind, and an open Bible, will change your life! I have read it several times."
3,Major drawback,"These work great for garments with narrow necks; however, the hangers are too short for many of my sweaters and scoopneck tops. I wear a ladies small or medium and have been disappointed."
5,Best Album Ever?,"I was a freshman at N. C. State in 1971 when I first heard this album. From start to finish, this is one of the best albums ever recorded. Every song takes me back to 1971. There is nothing more to review; a nearly perfect album."
1,Great album content but SACD quality blows,"If you have this on CD, do NOT buy the SACD -- there is no advantage to the new mix, and no quality improvement. Maybe the masters were in bad shape -- but given the stunning quality work done on Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon (a 30 year old recording) and the sweet sounds of the Billy Joel releases, you've got to think that this one was just a ""slam it onto SACD"" job, with no attention paid to remastering or cleaning up or even optimally extracting the sound from the masters. Don't buy it."
2,Much weaker than I remember,"I've read the female empowerment stuff in here. Huh? ""Where you lead, I will follow"" There are quite a few others in a similar vein. Maybe it's just all these years of changing sounds and expectations, but boy do these lyrics and arrangements sound lame. ""Ain't it good to know you've got a friend when people can be so cold."" That doesn't qualify as poetry in my lexicon.Spare performances--they changed the way singer-songwriters performed, but this is like watching black and white TV. Interesting, but without the color it feels washed out, not vibrant and intense.This is just one person's opinion--but I have surprisingly little interest in hearing these again."
4,Classic Carole King,Loved this album in my youth and am now loving it again. She's a class act! Take a trip down memory lane.
4,GREATER TALENT HITHER T' FIND,"What Carole lacks in dynamism is made up in greater song writing talent. Sexy vocals and worldly views add appeal to touchstone monument. Scored many years on chart. Jazzy and pop, simple yet sophisticated. Covered forever. On Irish TV (LATE LATE SHOW with GAYBO), she was to sing to us but just complained of parental abuse about other people being abused by their parents....no one had any idea what the hell she talked about? Well, IT'S TOO LATE NOW!"
5,"Carole King's ""Tapestry","I'm not a music reviewer, but I am a music lover and this album is Carole King's best work for all time."
3,Tapestry,This is an excellent CD with the best well known songs from Carol King. An Excellent purchase.
3,Does not age well,"Yes, yes, it's the famous Tapestry album. OK. But honestly, it doesn't age all that well. The extra CD with some live performances was just OK. Save yourself some coin and download the particular songs you liked on this album, believe me, the others are not worth it. And I would not call it a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination."
1,Complete waste time and money,"I have not purchased this worthless piece of trash, but I have read it. First of all, it is unauthorized, which usually mean that certain sources will not be available to the auther, such as the person they are writing about! Secondly, the writing is dismal, and rather like listening to fingernails on a chalkboard. I gave it one star because there was no lower rating.If you are a Sting fan, or curious, I would highly recommend ""Broken Music,"" Sting's autobiography. It is beautifully written, and painfully honest."
1,"Factually Interesting, But Poorly Written","First, a confession--I'm a Sting fan for several years, and a die-hard one at that. As much as I love his work with the Police and his solo material, I also know he isn't infallable--there are several instances where a different path might have reaped larger artistic dividends.Still, this is a hard read. It's interesting from a factual standpoint, as I learned a number of things about Sting that twenty years of fandom had failed to impress upon me. But the way Sanford writes is just so darn annoying that it approaches worthlessness at times. At times he's insightful, and you're pleased at how much sense his views make. Other times, you're amazed at just how hard he's trying to be hip, to be cool and dispassionate. At best it's annoying, at worst grating.You'll not find a better book on Sting on the market today...and that's the problem."
5,Two Great Movies For The Price Of One,"It's great to see Kickboxer 3&4 on dvd, after the release of 1,2,and 5. Kickboxer 3 The Art Of War takes a break from the sloan family vs tong po battle and takes place with david and xian going to rio. They bring down a guy who pimps out under age girls and all the while defending his title sucessfully.Kickboxer 4 The Aggressor is a great movie going back to david sloan vs. tong po. Much darker than the other kickboxer's david and tong po do battle one final time it is a must see and must have for any fan of the kickboxer series"
4,like you were there,"If you like Hot Tuna, and if you have seen them live in the last five years, I highly recomend this album. The CD is very representitive of what the current line up of Hot Tuna sounds like. A very under-rated band, and CD, in my opinion."
5,Relieving for this parent of a transgendered person,"This book really opened my eyes to the turmoil which my child has been going through for most of her life. It gave me an expanded view of the separation of gender and sex.I read this book in a single reading: laughing, then crying. It has helped me to accept my childs condition, understand the social risks and rewards, what is typically the several years long process of transition and has inspired me to do all I can to support her in what will be a difficult time, physically and emotionally.Thank you, Randi Ettner, thank you from the bottom of my heart."
4,A different kind of sea story,"Whilst not being quite your average 'going to sea' tale, Mary South has written an engaging story of her staid but not quite straight life on land, decision to leave the steady shores for a life afloat; and the trials and tribulations of learning to handle a powered vessel at sea.As she moves through new passages in her life and works at becoming a competent mariner, she reflects on her inability to manage relationships on land. These story threads are skillfully woven and net effect is compelling- I read the whole thing in one day."
1,Praying to Poseidon,"While I respect the author's courage to make the life change she did as I read the book I felt an undercurrent of sadness and depression about her. When I read about her praying to Poseidon rather than to almighty Godand all of the alcoholic drinking, I then understood why I was feeling this way. I put down this book and began to read something else that to me was more uplifting.Jane C. Kramer"
5,Great Caddy!,"I was very happy to receive this product. It is very sturdy and fit my bundt cake well, leaving more than enough room at the top (bout 2 inches) should I wished to have a fluffier frosting. I still handle the cake from the bottom instead of using the handles though, I'm always a bit paranoid because my cakes tend to be on the heavier side. Overall great product and suits my needs."
1,Not for High Cakes!,"I wish I had read all the comments before purchasing. I thought this would hold a high cake, but the description on Amazon failed to give all the dimensions. On the carrier, it states it will hold up to a ""4"" cake. This is because the base of the carrier is raised, limiting space inside. I am thinking of sending this back because I really wanted a carrier that would hold a tall cake. Amazon, please update your description."
4,Just What I've Always Needed,"This cake carrier is easy to use, easy to clean and exactly what I have been looking for. The sturdy material and three locks make me feel that the cake is secure. If you see me coming, look out, I might have cake!"
1,whats up with the food detail and big words?,"now, probably if you are into this series and like this guy's style then you loved this book. personally i found it strange: purposely using thise really big unknown words and describing down to the last morsel every piece of food he eats throught the whole book.ok the puzzle/mystery: great - gets a whole star by itself."
3,Mindless diversion,"If you are looking for a mystery novel that will not tax your brain and be mildly amusing then McNally's Puzzle is for you. Archy McNally is the Son in McNally and Sons, Attorneys At Law. Not a lawyer, not really a detective, more of a bon vivant who dabbles in crime. The stories (7 to date) take place in Palm Beach, FL and expose us to the upper class life style there. You can at least learn about wines and clothes and fancy food. There are a continuing cast of characters in addition to Archy and some crime. Here the crime is the murder of an elderly parrot shop owner. The suspects are relatively few and it does not take much to figure out who done it right from the start. The parrot tells us!! So if you have time to kill, are looking for some light reading while traveling or just do not want to tax your brain, Archy is your man."
4,A Strong Link in the DC Chain,"This is a good connector for a DC system. Not a complicated piece, but a very good one. The ends were all 4"" , the hose fit snuggly and the wire clamps held.When making a branch in the DC system, to go to several different pieces of equipment, the ""Y"" connection is better to use than the ""T"". The Y will allow for a better air flow. Combine the Y with a/several blast gates, then it's almost like having a single hose go to each piece of equipment."
5,Sturdy and fit up is good,"Good quality, 4 inch flex connects well and holds a clamp witout distorting. Good value."
2,One Excellent Story,"I saw quite a few reviews elsewhere about this book putting it down for it's heavy anti-Vatican II bias and preference for the Extraordinary Form. That didn't bother me a bit. I was looking for some traditional Catholic wisdom. There is one beautiful story in this book, ""Shannon,"" which is very moving and worth reading. On the whole, though, I have to confess that I found it rather depressing. It gave the impression that homeschooling is just too difficult for most Catholic families, so send the children to Catholic boarding school. And, the stories emphasized too much the heartaches and the trials of motherhood. I am aware that this is a Vale of Tears, but as a young mother just beginning, I hoped for something more encouraging and uplifting."
3,Not the book it could have been,"Quality, not quantity, Jack. This kind of thing slips out when you begin to believe your own legend. This book could have been so much more if it had not been dumbed-down. Not to kid level, but far enough to be below the level of the average buyer of this book. As it is, it stands in the way of the book that will not now be written, with more info on other members of the tyrannosaur tribe, f'rinstance. You're capable of better. Write fewer, but better books."
4,"Good for today, so-so for Trollope!","This book, when compared to what is written today, is excellent. Trollope is a master with words - as all readers of his works will agree. He has a tremendous command of the written word - unlike authors of today!! However, for Trollope compared to Trollope, the book is just so-so. Many of his other novels are far superior. The book concerns the trials and tribulations of Miss MacKenzie after she inherits a fortune and then looses it. We see how her friends, neighbors, and male paramours react to her as her status in life changes. It's, as all Trollope books, enjoyable, but not one of his better books."
4,In It's Time,"This is a bon bon novel of Trollope's time. Silly, very old fashioned, but clear glimpse into the social and religious. Was disappointed in the heroine, but she was a creature of her time."
5,Five Stars,I was moved to tears. Then I experienced joy. But that had nothing to do with the CD. I am bipolar. Then I listened to this wonderful CD and experienced tears of joy. Bill Reveles is awesome!
1,not good for me because of the B-6,"I get a good reaction from melatonin, and usually take 1.5 mg at night trader joes brand but wanted to try a time release version. This did not work well for me, I only tried two nights but I think the b-6 had me restless or something I am not really certain what the issue was but this did not work for me at all and I am going to throw it out and try something else"
1,"Placebo, or worse","A waste of money (especially at $10 from the local over-priced island grocery). I have been fighting sleep issues for years and gave up on the Big Pharma approaches (ambien, benzos) due to side effects and habituation. Melatonin has helped me before, so after reading an article that discussed TR, I thought I would give this a try. Awake almost all night, with no sense that this is anything other than a placebo... Not even a hint of the usual melatonin drowsiness, and I tried three nights in a row with similar results.(To clarify, I'm not going through any kind of rebound insomnia from that other stuff, which was quite a while ago... all bets are off when that is happening. Now just looking for a reasonably reliable sleep aid that isn't toxic.)"
5,Splitting the pill works.,"I've read that cutting a time-release tablet destroys the time-release properties, but these pills when split work even when split.I received my bottle yesterday and tested it out by cutting the tablet into quarters. Went to bed at 10pm and woke up before 6am. Perfect. Before I was taking a non-TR and a 6-hour TR melatonin pill. With thenon-TR, just the regular immediate release pills, I'd wake up 3 hours later, having to take another dose for another 3 hrs of sleep. The6-hour TRwas just too short a duration -- in bed at 10pm, wake by 4am. The 8-hour is perfect.Just a warning, the pills tend to crumble when split."
4,Hope & Glory,"Hope & Glory is very important, socially conscience CD. It's messages ring true with evrything going on in the world. Ann Wilson has succeeded in bringing that message to us. I have been listening to her and that cyrstal clear voice for 30 years and for me this CD was log awaited. Her interesting choices of collaboraters is perfect and instills value to its songs. Where else can you get Ann & Nancy Wilson, Elton John, Wynonna, Shawn Colvin, Rufus Wainwright, Allison Krauss,Gretchen Wilson on one amazing CD? Hope & Glory is the real thing!"
5,A Winner,Never mind the political drivel of some other reviewers. Ann Wilson does some great covers of thoughtful classic songs with some able assistance. I am on my third listening as I type away. Buy it and you'll be glad you did.
4,Ann Wilson can do it all,"The production of the CD was disappointing. We saw Heart in concert where Ann was promoting this CD. Her live performance set me up for very high expectations. She doesn't rock this CD but she does create a great new version of your old favorite songs. The more I listen to this CD, the more I appreciate it. Just wish it rocked a little more."
1,Lacks Depth; Not the Original Recordings,"If you prefer hired studio artists taking the soul out of the original, heartfelt performances of the artists who originally wrote these songs, then this is for you. If you would rather experience the depth and meaning meant to be heard in this great songs, then look elsewhere. Maybe start by googling ""Alan Lomax."""
1,"Extremely Dangerous! Poorly made, Very Hard to turn",DON'T BUY! This product did not come with instructions. I cut a big gash out of my thumb while inserting the turning blade. You have to push down to pop the masher in and the sides will keep popping out and you have to push it back in and it snaps out with such force that it cut me bad a very deep cut I will have to go get stitches. Even when put together it did not work properly it was too hard to turn and it was easier for me to strain my potatoes through a mesh wire rice strainer than to use this piece of crap. It looks good to the eye all polished and shiny but it does not work at all and it not only cut me it scratched up my dining room table as the bottom is unfinished steel and left deep gnash lines from my putting it together on the table. I am going to contact the company and put in a claim - Amazon should not sell such an inferior dangerous product!
2,Thought it was made in France,"MIU France Stainless Steel Tomato/Vegetable MillDisappointed as I thought I was buying a French made product. Product discription/information on the Amazon website does not disclose that it is actually made in China and with this product being advertised as ""MIU France Stainles Steel Tomato/Vegetable Mill"", gives the impression it is a product made in France. I was after a quality product wanting either French or Italian made so was extremely disappointed as I could have purchased a Chinese made food mill in Australia a lot cheaper than what I ended up paying. The Mill itself is light but the gap along the underneath length of the handle is quite wide and it is very easy for your finger/s to slide into the gap, which can be quite dangerous. Not a fan of this style at all."
1,stainless trash!,recieved Mill and tryed to mill ripe peaches and the handle fell off right away and the mill coundnot push peaches thru large blade grater and just made a big mess do not buy!!!!!!!!
1,Don't buy,"I bought this to prepare baby food. After about a month, one of the tabs that holds the crank popped off so now it's useless. I've received no response to my inquiries from Amazon or MIU."
1,Not even for geeks.,"Unless you're a PERL weenie and just love all the technical jargon and obscure set up code in this book -- forget it.

3,Tykes on Bikes,"Another in a long line of wrong roles for Brando, as well as a ridiculous collection of gentrified cycle rats, but despite this basic silliness, there is the girl--Mary Murphy whose conflicted desires stole the show--and the music...fun West Coast jazz featuring Kenton graduates, Shorty Rogers and Shelly Manne (aka Manny Shell and Roger Short because of recording contract issues).Sadly it was Marlon Brando who recovered from the train wreck rather than Mary Murphy."
3,"Interesting, but totally Hollywood","I just had to watch this to understand how the whole outlaw biker thing started. As usual, Marlin Brando did nothing to make this movie. Lee Marvin was awesome in his short stint as a rival gang leader. The real outlaws gravitated to Marvin's ""Chino"" Character, who is a Biker, Boozer, and a Fighter dressed in original Biker garb. I wish the movie was about Marvin's band of Bikers rather than than Brando's (Johnny) MC. They looked like a bunch of Elvis wannabees. Its a classic, so buy it for your Biker library."
2,I like Brando but....,"OK........Brando is pretty good being Brando towards the end of this film..Lee Marvin is good...the bikes are ok..but all those black and white,sound stage,Mayberry RFD,enclosed,interior shots of the outdoors,interior shots of bars,restaurants,that look, at best,sterile,cannot save an actor ,no matter how great he is..."
5,THE ORIGIONAL BIKER MOVIE,if you are my age and have never seen this before or even if you have you will find it interesting and marvel at the actors you now know as seniors shown here as young men + women
1,The Human Machine Writes 'Names 'for its hurts!,"When people have written that they think this is a good option for busy therapists in the age of managed care- I cringe. This reduces the complexities of the human experience into study hall.The only possible usage for this sort of material would be in-patient perhaps, as assignments for interim periods, but as a one on one tool- it stands in the way of transferrence and humanistic care."
5,a sensual book...,"This is a wonderful book for any lover of Sargent's work. I have quite a few monographs on Sargent, and this one contains work which I have not seen before. It focuses on every aspect of his ouvre, from portraits, landscapes, genre, and figurative studies. Not only do the selected works represent the sensuality that eminates from Sargent's hand and mind, but the layout of the actual book reflects this also. The last section of the book is devoted to some of his male figure charcoal studies, which are incredibly inspiring. They are printed on laid paper (different from the rest of the book), and have a beautiful quality to them. Most of them are even different drawings than those reproduced in the ""Sargent: Male Nudes"" book. This is very refreshing to see, as the drawings bring us right into the studio with Sargent, almost looking over his shoulder while he renders the figure with unwavering power and finesse...."
5,Josephine Bonaparte,I read this full series and this book was the last one. I enjoyed the historical aspects and found it a fascinating read.
4,Seiko watches,"Watch arrived promptly, well packaged, and safe. It's pretty and the lady's standard size does fit. However, the watch chain is superfluous. It does not help secure anything, comes undone frequently, and dangles. I removed it. That unfortunately leaves the two small loops by the fastener which sercured the chain, oh well."
1,Wait for a HD Theatrical Version to be released,"I had Payback on DVD...it is still one of my favorite Mel Gibson movies. I picked up the HD-DVD for cheap a while back and only just got around to watching it today. I assumed since I had it on HD-DVD that I could sell my DVD version on eBay, so I did. Now I'm stuck with this crappy version of the movie. I have to say the Director's Cut absolutely ruins the movie. It's shorter and it ruins the end of the movie. It is not the same movie and in no way can I recommend buying the Director's Cut. Buy it on DVD or wait for them to re-release it on Bluray either in a dual format (theatrical+director's) or just the theatrical version. Most times the Director's Cut is a decent improvement, or at least it doesn't do enough to really change the movie at all. This is not one of those times. Do NOT buy the director's cut in any format if you want to see the good movie that made it past the cutting room floor."
5,good movie,It was a real good movie.Oh I owned it already so maybe thats y I liked it well gotta go now
2,Neutral on this movie.,The plot just didn't grab me. However the acting and camera work was fine. Just an OK movie for killing some time.
5,Love this movie,"Great movie, no social commentary just a grand old shoot 'em up. Just watched ""Get the Gringo"" and it reminded me so much of Payback that I had to watch it again"
5,Payback,I have loved this flick since I first saw it in the theater and my hopes were high when I ordered a copy.It arrived on schedule and in the advertised condition.Great service!
2,"Sorry guys, but the the studio was right this time!","Short but sweet. If you are looking for self indulgent director droppings, buy this DVD. The theatrical release was tight and relentless. I prefer it. One of the first times I preferred studio version to director version, but I did. It's going to be a matter of taste. I wish I had rented, rather than bought. I would advise you do the same - they are two very different movies."
2,Disappointing,Didn't like this as well as the original version. Ending was way different and I liked Kristofferson in the original release.
3,"mobsters, pusher, addicts and w_ores New York style","Here you have dirty cops, addict wives and golden hearted w_oresagainst ""the outfit"" as the new mobsters are calling themselves.Porter ( no first name) is shot in the back by his wifeafter robbing a Chinese Tong crime family of $140000.Somehow he recovers and is too stubborn stupid to die or take no for an answer.With all the good and bad guys after him at once, he managesto survive?For action junkies this is a good fix, but as drama acting goes it comes short ofa Humphrey Bogart film. I liked the movie, but think thatthere was a little to much bloody violence in it."
4,A good movie that got better.,The first movie was good but this was a totally different take. They definitely should have released this version the first time out. I think the mysterious Sally Kellerman no show on the phone as the syndicate boss instead of the visible Kris Kristofferson was much more effective. The last different fifteen minute ending was also such a pleasant surprise you could not help but enjoy it that much more. Kudos to director Brian Helgeland.
1,Director's Crap Cut...,"Payback (the theatrical edition) has been one of my favorite movies since the day I saw it. It was witty, cynical, and B.A.This edition ""the director's cut"" is really a remake with a brand new ending and a lot of the best part removed from the middle. This edition is terrible. Like any pieced together film, it really doesn't even know what it is. Occasionally it's a mafia movie and occasionally it's the bitter drama of a murdered man.Buy Payback (the theatrical edition)!"
1,Over-Produced,"'Payback' can't decide if it's black comedy, edgy action/thriller, or pulp fiction. In typical Hollywood fashion, this was a project pulled in too many different directions by producers, et al. There was real potential here, and I'm pleasantly surprised Mel Gibson would attempt this kind of role, but I found the film wholly unsatisfying."
2,Horrible,The Blu-ray director's cut is horrible. The picture quality was very poor for Blu-ray and the additional scenes actually make the plot worse. Original DVD is much better. Sorry I wasted my money.
2,Disappointed in the Director's Cut,"Where was Kris Kristopherson?! Why was he taken completely out of the director's cut? Or was he added for the theatrical version? Whatever the answer I feel like it was less of a movie without him. To me, the lady on the speakerphone seemed to be a bad edit to replace a very good character."
4,Definetly worth the price!,"in this movie Mel Gibson is a small time hood who tries to get back at a friend who betrayed him, this is a brilliant combination of humor and violence"
3,Let's do some math...,"If Mel's character was after his share of the take that originally was in the 5 digits, why didn't he absolutely demand that it be upped to seven digits-plus, after all the hell and life-threatening experiences he went through? Wouldn't you? Hell, yes! Some good action, a truck load of violent scenes, but not a great flick over all."
3,"OK, but not the best revenge movie","I found payback to be ok but have seen better revenge movies than this. Thought it had the right ingredients to be better with a few fine tuning here or there especially at the beginning. Overall if you enjoy these types of films it is for sure worth a watch if you have not already seen it, yet to really enjoy a great movie of revenge in my opinion, check out 'City of Industry' with Harvey Keitel and Stephen Dorff from 1997.Peter J. Miller"
4,Great Book,"If you're a performer looking for monologue material, you need this on a shelf in your library. It will serve you well as a part of your audition arsenal."
4,A Good Neighbor - A Great Story,"While looking for some non-erotica gay literature, I came upon this book and gave it a chance. I found it hard to put this book down. Very engrossing and not overly detailed, nor is it too skimpy on details. The characters, though few and sometimes predictable, are very well-drawn, and the story is told in a very light-hearted way. There are a couple downsides to the book overall: numerous punctuation errors and spelling mistakes. We are taught in English classes that ""alright"" is all wrong. It is spelled ""all right"" and I wish to goodness that more people would be aware of this. But do these things interfere with the story or make it difficult to follow? Thankfully, no. It is a fine gay drama without the glitter and poppers and raunchy sex one so often finds in other less restrained novels. I really enjoyed this book."
3,Not An Admirable Human Being In The Lot!,"While I did think the book was very well written- if you're looking for heroes- or even just someone to like, you're not about to find it in this story. A couple of the characters are down-right terrible, and the funny part is, I think we're expected to identify with and like the remainder of them- but this reader did not. None of them live lives I'd wish to. And none of them lead lives or have experiences that I feel mirror my own in any way. In short, I felt like I was simply a brain-dead-bored voyeur sneaking looks thru the window of a pair of homes that I certainly would have walked away from, had I anything better to do at the time. Reading this book made me question why I wish to find love. If the love these folks have settled for is what my future holds- I'd rather remain single. Like the Reba song says: ""I'd Rather Be Lonely, Alone""."
2,will this writer improve,"I really enjoyed the first book of mr. quinn that I read, METES AND BOUNDS. it was a little uneven in structure, but overall I felt is had some depth and held promise. however, with each successive novel by mr. quinn, I find myself increasingly disappointed. THE GOOD NEIGHBOR is easily his most simplistic piece of writing, sometime sophomoric, sometimes preachy, it never really explores the depth of any internal conflict for its protagonist"
5,Readable & Useful,"Practical ideas, based on sound theory, that managers at every level can actually use to improve their workplace. A rare combination!"
2,Bad scanning and disc printing,"The scanner is very fast but does not scan the colors correctly. My yellow scanned and printed as a light brown. The cd tray always get jammed 2 times out of 3 tries. The printer does a good job at printing color photos, but only if you use photo paper. Photo print on plain paper is negligible. Black printing is good. I would not buy another Epson. Going back to HP."
1,errors and expensive ink,"If you've just bought this printer and write a positive review, just wait until you run out of ink and try to replace the cartridges....this is what you will see: ""cannot recognize ink cartridges"" - yes folks, even with the exact SAME cartridges from Epson. It totally sucks - rendered completely inoperable - check out the blogs on-line about this printer - it's an eye opener - wish I had read them before I purchased the printer."
1,Becomes a BRICK without full set of working ink cartridge. No scanner feature!,"This printer becomes a BRICK if any one of the ink cartridges goes bad or empty! You have to have a working set of ink cartridges EVEN TO USE THE SCANNER FEATURE!! The Epson scanner software reports ""scanner busy or warming up"" and refuse to scan.Even if you don't use the printer (you soon won't once you find out how much it cost to replace the tiny little cartridges, $70, and how many pages you actually get out of it), the ink dries slowly, and the printer won't work as a scanner anymore once any of the ink cartridge dries up.This has to be one of the worst purchases I've ever made. I will NEVER buy another piece of Epson equipment!"
5,You get what you pay for!,"This is the best hose that i have found to date.It does cost more money but it performs well.I have two sets.I also have the 6"" hose.It is best to use the wire style clamps to retain the hose to the machine or dust pipe.I have seen these hose used on big molders with six heads.Hope this helps your choice of hose.Thanks, Weyer Service"
4,flexible but strong,"this hose turned out to be alot more flexible than i expected....perfect for a mobile dust collection set up. the clear plastic wall is thin (allowing flexibility) but seems strong enough for woodshop use. it will not support my weight (160lbs) if i stood on it but otherwise the wire is rigid.i would not recommend this hose for runs longer than 10ft because the inner surface is not very smooth at all as a result of the flexing plastic walls.i also bought a piece of ""valley gasket & rubber"" 5"" clear hose from amazon which turned out to be almost the same as the jet but with a heavier guage plastic wall."
5,A hug from Jesus,"Second only to the Bible on a serious Christian's ""must read"" list.A magnificently written, powerfully close experience of Jesus.....you will never forget it."
4,It's a cable,"Well, it is a cable and it works. I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 because of its generic black color. A 5 star power cable would be neon pink or purple or something out of the ordinary."
4,he's back,"I'm surprised at some of the poor reviews here. Yeah, the steel drums are a bit much, and through the first few tracks I was only intrigued. But as soon as I heard ""Push the Feelings"" this disc felt like a reunion with an old friend, and it continued in that vein pretty much all the way to the terrific closing track. If you think ""100% Fun"" is the quintessential Matthew Sweet album, like I do, there's a good chance you'll love this CD too. I hope people give it a fair chance."
1,Don't get this if you want to learn how to make a mobile!,"Likely written in UK. Poor instructions, unattractive examples. Lots of word without sketches. Black and white, no color. Even my local library didn't want it for their Crafts section."
2,Carole,"Water comes out like a shower head and splashes all over like, well, a shower. What were they thinking with this design?I contacted Kohler about the problem and they promptly sent a new aerator. Faucet works just fine now."
2,Lethargic,"The title of this review basically says it all about this release. I've been a Prefab Sprout fan for many years, even liked their unloved ""Cowboy"" record, but this is on the verge of being boring. Only for the hard core fans, like me, and that might be stretching it."
4,OH AND FOR THIS PERSON WHO WROTE THIS REVIEW,"""Jay's production is amazing. With Fang Wun Shan's lyrics, we can see why he music sells. Speaking of lyrics, I say there's great difference between Taiwanese pop music's lyrics and Amercian pop music's lyrics. American lyrics, especially rap, contains profane, viloence, and sex. But in Taiwan, lyrics are just like beautiful poems. I think Americans should get to know more about this Taiwanese music. My favorite song: Hair Like Snow (plus it's music video is awesome!)Vincent from Taiwan""i dont believe you live in taiwan in the first place. second thing you should really know you facts before saying stuff cause jay chou does rap about violence. one of them is ""dad i have come back"". yeah get your facts striaght before you say something"
1,Horrible,"Don't waste your time. It came in damaged and when I contacted them their service was terrible. The craftmanship is awful it won't stay tuned, the frets are sharp and dangerous. THeir customer service is horrific. I buy things from Amazon all the time and have never had such a terrible experience. Don't waste time and money, they don't stand behind their stuff. Go to guitar center and spend a few more dollars for a guaranteed Fender... RUN!!!"
4,Touching and enjoyable,This was a very touching and enjoyable read. Some parts were a bit predictable but it was a joy to read.
3,Okay thriller,"The actors are good, though the script and execution of the story were somewhat lacking. It's one of those movies that could have been more than what it is."
1,Boooooooooring!...,"Wow!...I had high hopes for this film, based on the synopsis and the reviews of others who have already seen it, but this film blows! It has an interesting premise and could've been very good or even awesome, but the story is just boring and very slow. I actually felt myself nodding off to sleep--and I suffer from insomnia! LOL! There are many other good flicks in this genre available here on Amazon Video On-Demand and I highly suggest you try one of them and don't bother 'answering the phone' on ""The Caller"". Zzzzzzzz."
3,would be 5 star but ...,"There are a couple of things that prevent me from rating this at 5 stars. First is the changes from the great animation of the original opening sequence, I've seen the raws, to a rather trite collage Second, if you own some video players, it will load, but not play. I also have this problem with newer Paramount and Sony. If funimation continues, they have lost a primary market customer. I own a Spectroniq home theater system, which performs wonderfully for almost all dvds, including those with regional encoding. It plays great on my older Samsung, but I am restricted to the tv speakers with it. After that, I rented Part 2, and it plays the same. Save your money if you have problems with Sony, or Paramount disks. The anime itself is great, if not for the aforementioned issues, it would merit 5 stars."
4,Awesome DTS CD!!!,"The sound quality is amazing! I love DTS CD's. Wish they had a larger selection. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it didn't have songs like 'Too busy thinking about my baby', 'Inter City Blues', 'Sexual Healing', You're All I need to Get By', and 'Got To Give It Up'. Still worth it though."
1,Total Disppointment,"When I was growing up, my parents had an album titled 'The Bells of Christmas', which was gorgeous, and to me it always brought back many fond memories of Christmas. I had hoped that this was the same 'Bells of Christmas,' or at least similar. However, the songs/tunes are not even recognizable for the most part, and the chimes of the bells sound discordant, and rarely even pretty. This was a total waste of money, don't buy it unless all you want to hear is a bunch of bells clanging with no apparent tune, for the entire duration of the CD."
5,Excellent Tile Saw!!!,This saw is great. It is the second one that I've owned. The first lasted about six years and I used it heavily. I got many more miles than I expected and it paid for itself several times over. I would definitely recommend.
2,For very small jobs at best.,"This tile saw was not very nice and fairly hard to use. It was messy and hard to get straight cuts with this saw. The quality of the saw was not very solid and the safety cover for the blade really didn't work well. I would only use this saw if you had a few 6 inch or 8 inch tiles to cut. I think it would have been better to rent a good tile saw or buy a better one. We eneded up throwing this saw in the trash when we were done with it. Also, it could make some of the more complex cut (e.g. cut the center of a tile out for an electrical outlet). Not a great product."
3,small but works,"I got the saw because I was doing 18x18 inch tile and needed a table saw to cut something that big. This little fella did the job fine and is still working, however it is small, plastic, and pretty weak and I doubt it will last for several more jobs. I won't use this saw unless I am making large cuts that my regular saw can't do, so for that kind of job and the infrequency of it's use... it fits the bill for me. plus at the price I got it for it was cheaper than renting one!"
1,Disappointed.,"Not what I expected from this saw. Use it only if you are going to cut small, 6"" or less tiles. I would not recommended for lager tiles. Save your money. It is really messy. Water goes almost everywhere and is a pain to clean. Either buy a more expensive one or rent a heavy duty one from a rental center. This saw is for an amateur and not for professional results. Bottom line is that you get what you pay for."
2,Pain in the neck,"This could be a good saw if only the company had made the fence a little more durable and user friendly. If not just perfectly aligned the saw binds and chips the end of each cut. The guide could be easier to see also, as it gets filled with crud very quickly. I used it for about an hour on a small job that required many cuts and got so frustrated I put it back in the box for return tomorrow. That is why I deal with amazon.com."
5,Awesome!,"I loved this book! It talks about all the great stuff the community, and about how great a football player was. Get this book!"
1,Great movie/terrible music,"I was very disappointed when I watched this dvd. I had seen ""The General"" for the first time at an outdoor theatre last summer in Greece. I was absolutely blown away by Keaton's genius. I, along with a international audience were entertained, moved, and inspired by this film. I did a bit of research as to what dvd edition to purchase and took a chance on this one. Wrong choice. In my opinion the music here just doesn't ""feel"" right. And, at times even becomes a bit irritating. It really is too bad because the visuals of this eition are superb. Shame on Roger Ebert for saying The Alloy Orchestra is ""the best in the world at accompanying silent films."" I highly recommend this film but not this dvd."
2,Truly Great Films - Truly Incompatible Music,"Both films are wonderfully acted and provide many laughs. Indeed these are two of the top silent film comedies of all time. Unfortunately, the new soundtrack recorded by the Alloy Orchestra is not only substandard compared to the music I've seen accompanying past versions of the films, but often, and I mean OFTEN downright distracting and inappropriate to the action. I'm selling my copy and looking for a copy of one or both films with more appropriate soundtracks."
5,the best thing 2 use if you want 2 lose weight,i use this when i run and swim...it works good....i luv it
4,A GOOD READ,THIS IS A WELL WRITTEN BOOK ABOUT A VERY INTERESTING MAN. JACKIE WAS TRULY A VERY GIFTED ATHLETE. HE HAD A LOT TO OVERCOME IN HIS PRIVATE LIFE. I REALLY ENJOYED HIS STORY. THE AUTHOR DOES A FINE JOB RETELLING JACKIE'S CAREER AND LIFE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL BASEBALL FANS.
5,In Too Deep with Belinda Carlisle,"This CD deserves five stars already because of the first song ""In Too Deep"". It is one of the most beautiful songs I know, very touching and very moving. You really don't have to be afraid of getting in too deep, if Belinda Carlisle is with you! Other great songs are ""A Woman And A Man"", ""Listen To Love"", ""Always Breaking My Heart"" and ""My Heart Goes Out To You"". As the titles indicate, it is all about expressing our heart feelings, and Belinda Carlisle does it with much spiritual authority. I can't say how much I love her voice!"
3,"Nice print, Nice content, enumerable mistakes","With a first glance I could capture atleast 3 errors from the pg #312 to #314 in the chapter Beyond the basic. But I found very simple explainations of concepts like template and namespaces. Good book to understand concepts, may need little tweak in for the example code."
3,return(1); //too many errors in code.,"Lots of typos and code errors make this book more difficult to follow than it should be. If you've got some programming background, then you'll catch them easily, so they'll be a nuisance rather than a serious source of frustration. The code examples are also rather trivial. It's not so helpful to see a fully coded and commented example of assigning a pointer, when it's already been presented in the text. Better to see a program that does something useful. The book could have been shortened by 200 pages by omitting excess whitespace and useless code examples. Straightfoward prose explanation seemed to suffer in places. Overall, a pretty good intro to OOP; not a terrible book, but you could probably find a better one."
3,Where was Carson?,"When I got this book, it wasn't a tv show with a cute gay guy! The fact is no book, no matter how great is going to be able to help you change your mental body image. That takes more then a book, but the book is a starting place. Body hatred is so rampant these days because we are constantly comparing ourselves to the air brushes of the world. If you are working on loving yourself from the inside out, give this book a read. If you are looking for a miracle cure that will fix how you feel when you look in the mirror, this isn't going to help."
3,Mystery Lover,I have been an avid reader of all Aaron Elkins books but I had a difficult time getting through Skeleton Dance.It's so slow moving and a bit boring.
3,Good polish,"I purchased a number of Mothers products to clean my new car. This polish works okay. I expected it to really buff up the chrome on my car, but it was not quite as good as I thought it would be. That being said, I have only tried it one time and plan to use it again with hopefully better results.I will update my review after using the product several more times."
5,Prinsess Ka'iulani film,"This movie is not only beautifully filmed and directed, but also a terrific way to learn about the history of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Although some minor liberties were taken due to length of the film, the story was nevertheless so close to what really happened that I heartily recommend it for everyone who wants to learn about the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom and what happened to the Hawaiian people."
1,Catalog picture and text incorrect,"I ordered this clamp based on the photograph in the catalog and the text that states it is a ""face frame clamp"". Later I found that the clamps pictured are actually two different clamps made by Woodstock. One for face frame and one for clamping thin stock at right angles. Unfortunately Tool Crib only has the one for thin stock."
5,Mitsubishi HC3000U,The projector preforms very well. Picture quality is excellent. Easy to operate. With a ceiling mount and even though the projector has no lens shift I had no problem obtaining an image with no keystoning problems. Projector is extremely quiet. Very little fan noise. Switching between multiple input sources is easy. The projector is brighter that the one I replaced but I did expect it to be a little brighter that what it is. However brightness is very acceptable. Contrast is execellent.
1,The real truth!,I don't know why they say I wrote this book. Actually I didn't. Others have wrote it for me.
2,Blah,"In the spirit of Easy Writer, I'll keep this review short; the book is as cloying as it sounds."
5,A great little reference book,"This was required for one of my writing classes, but I will surly keep it for future reference. It has everything you will need for citations in term papers."
5,Excellent,"""Tiempos"" is like a good book, you just can't put it down or in this case though, take it out of the CD player. This is a CD to be listen to not just to play it. I find the song entitled ""Vida"" to be an inspiration, with words that when I listen to it, make me want to be more down to earth, a better person toward others.Mr. Blades is the best artist in the industry and what an idol he is. I have been buying his music since day one and I will keep on buying it since his is the Elite in its class."
1,Meditations for Weight Loss,Next time I will not buy any DVD's or CD's that I cannot hear part of first. I did not like this and it was not what I expected - Amazon should allow their customers the ability to hear part of any DVD's or CD's that they have for sale.
3,Hasn't worked yet,I just started listening to this CD and so far it has not helped me to lose weight. I do enjoy listening to it and it is very relaxing. It puts me to sleep which isn't so bad.
4,One of the best Ballos I've ever heard,"With the exception of Callas, this is one the best casts you will ever hear. With this being the ""Tenor's"" opera, Di Stefano does his best to make it his alright(It's especially amusing to hear his ""Con Me"" when he finds out Amelia is waiting to see Ulrica, just imagine a Milnes gesture with his hand up to his face as he sings it!!). Simionato does what she does best(sing)in probably one of the longest parts Verdi ever wrote for a mezzo in his operas. Ratti is a good oscar, not doing too bad being the third leading lady in the opera. Then I save the best for last-Bastianini. It is different to hear the baritone as a good guy for once, and Ettore does it exceptionally. He was definitely ""on"" that night in terms of vocal splendour. The Eri Tu is just captivating, and if anything, go ahead and buy this just for that! Seriously, though, I highly recommend this recording."
5,Simply amazing,"He touched my soul. As a Jonathan Butler devotee, I was transfixed by his mesmerizing guitar playing. Raul is touched by God, who I thank for giving us this revelation."
3,Great start...,"This was a great start for Raul Midon. I expect even better than this album next time around. It's like Goapelle her first album was pretty well put together BUT it gave her second album a lot more room to get better. Raul is no different.It's amazing to me how he plays guitar. He fuses falmenco by the way he plays guitar, and R&B; by the way he sings.I recommend it."
2,A bit overhyped,"I expected a lot from this CD, but was really disappointed. Midon feels a bit one-dimensional and I'd agree that there isn't much to ""hook"" a listener. A few good songs, and a good listen or two, but not much to bring you back."
5,Breathtaking,"This CD is a definite must have. Raul is a rare and blessed talent. His latin soulful music, voice and guitar expressions will take you to a level of bliss. Just when you think you have heard and seen the best, someone like him comes along and makes you want to get your salsa on or just sit and reminisce with your coffee and a candles. State of Mind, Suddenly, If You're Gonna Leave, Waited All My Life are my favorites but every song on this CD is a work of art."
5,Raul Midon is Bad to the Bone,"I first saw Raul on one of the Late Night talk shows but missed his name. Somehow I ran into him again and so I bought his Cd immediately. I was blown away. His musicianship is awesome as well as the lyrics and overall heartfelt sentiment of the songs. If you like Stevie Wonder (and who doesn't) or Jonathon Butler you will LOVE Raul Midon. Buy Raul Midon's ""State of Mind"" TODAY!!!!! But get ready for all your friends asking, ""Who the hell is this? I've got to have it."""
1,WAYYY Overrated,"I normally would give this movie 2 or 3 stars, but I had to counter all the ridiculous 5 star hyperbole of too many of these reviews.This movie is terribly gorgeous...and that is all.The characters are not fleshed out.The dialogue explains nothing and is virtually non-existent.It is also very, very, very SLOOOOWWWWW.All is sacrificed for the sake of beautiful cinematics.Well, gee, I could've gotten that by watching a documentary on the History Channel or Discovery, you know?"
1,"I've had enough of the Holocaust, haven't you?","Roman Polanski, the exiled [physical] offender now hiding in Europe from the U.S. authorities, was given a best director oscar for this largely [imitation] work portraying *Jewish oppression* in Easern Eurpoe during WWII. The Academy Award was merely a political statement by the leftist Hollywood elite who apparently believe that *artists* such as Polanski are way above the law. ""The Pianist"" steals from ""The Holocaust"",""Schindler's List"", and a host of other Jewish propaganda movies, ... The main character, a ... piano player, spends most of the movie running from the SS, getting sick, and hiding like a rat, while he loses his parents, brother, and sisters to the concentration camps. Any red-blooded American in that situation would have grabbed a gun and fought to the death to save his family. The Pianist eventually *wins* his freedom courtesy of real men of the Red Army. ..."
1,"Tedious drama, unremarkable perspective.","Before purchasing this DVD, I didn't know the particulars about statutory rape charges and Roman Polanski. My vote today is not on that legal and moral issue.As a patron, I purchased what I hoped to be a fresh view regarding an terrible period in human history. I was looking for a new Shindler's List. But this story failed to meet expectations. If I wanted to spend hours listening to fine piano, maybe. But I wanted what lacked here: uniqueness, a tight story, excellent entertainment, and the sensation proclaimed. It just didn't do it for me."
1,Made by an alleged rapist?,"How can anybody admire, or even watch, a movie made by an alleged rapist who fled the US to escape justice? Until he comes back to face the courts, and to do his sentence (whatever it may be) like a man instead of a coward, his movies should be ignored. Talent does not matter. Neither does the important subject matter of the Holocaust. That's it."
3,The Pianist,"The story is not that good, it was so unreal that the pianist has always people who helped him during those days."
5,The Pianist,Received the dvd just a few days aftewr ordering. Looking forward to watching it again as I enjoyed the movie when it came out.
4,The Pianist....Great movie !,"I have never been able to watch war movies, waaaay to violent, just didn't like them at all ! This is set in war time, in Europe, That part was necessary, I'm sure, as it was the whole point....what the Adren Brody character went through, and his survival.The music was just amazing, the acting, superb, and, I found myself so caught up in the story line that the violence hardly bothered me."
2,"Movie is great, blu-ray quality poor","The following is an excerpt from a report about the blu-ray transferquality of the TVA Canadian release, currently posted[...]. (The TVA Canadian release is the one released April 28 2009, which has a cover image of the pianist's hands on the keyboard, shown from above.)""The movie ""The Pianist"" is a moving and beautiful piece that truly deserves better treatment than this unfortunate 'cash grab' by TVA Films. The video maxes out at 1080i (yes, you read that correctly - not (P)rogressive) and the sound is (shudder) only Dolby Digital - not DolbyTrueHD or DTS Master HD. ... The packaging also seems sub-par with no actual Blue-Ray logo on the plastic (like every other BD disc out there) and the ""1080p"" gold logo is used on the back (and that is simply inaccurate). The disc, quite frankly, seems more like a bootleg than an actual new release BD. ...""Also note that the TVA release is in full frame, not the original widescreen format."
1,Slow Paced and disappointing to say the least,"It's been a year since I seen the pianist, The movie has an overall good storyline but the slow paced scenes are ""yawn worthy"" if you like movies that have long and slow dialog than you'll truly love this film."
3,Great product BUT,"The short and narrow of this product is everything is fine But You pull the plunger back to suck in the soap ,the soap leaks out as fast as it came in so hold it up and it still comes out . But the rest is real fine , love the brush and Mitt , havent used the easy dry yet but i,ll get around to it . The brush is great for Rims and tires . The mitt is great for the finish . Pretty good product though .I used Mequirs car wash soap , love that too .Geo"
2,Soap drains out too fast,"The handle literally lets the soap simply run out, whether using the mop or brush. It doesn't require any pressure against the car, it simply empties out by itself. And unless you wash very fast, the soap will be gone before you've even washed one side of your car. If you have to spend any extra time cleaning a particular spot, the soap will be gone before you even move on. In the long run you're probably going to spend more money on soap then before you got this system, because it will take two buckets full instead of just one. But the soapy water will be cleaner."
4,Sargent at his best,"Sir Malcolm was universally considered to be the finest choral conductor of his time. Just listen to the way the Royal Choral Society sing ""The Boar's Head Carol"" to enjoy the dash and spirit Sargent and his splendid choristers bring to this collection of Christmas carols. Warmly recommended."
2,way below expectations,"This book suffers from bad printing. Good luck trying to interpret the screen grabs from book. At least if they're going to be that bad put some high res versions on the cd.I agree with the previous reviewer about diluting the book with all of the preliminary stuff about a story, and how to draw. If you're going to struggle to follow the tuts in this book you'd better be way beyond that.And what's with Sybex's web site with the weird errata for chapter 22? At least I'll never get to chapter 22.Don't waste your money."
1,Porta-Nails 421P Pneumatic Floor Nailer,"I think this nailer has the potential for being very good, albeit in its current model it falls very short of what I expected. All too frequently it jams or the nails are not recessed correctly if at all. I find that using a manual nailer is much simpler, safer and if you factor in the time needed to fix all the jams - is much quicker (and a heck of a lot cheaper). I would give this current model two thumbs down and would not recommend it to anyone who lays hardwood flooring for a living."
5,The master at work,"If you ever wanted to know more about guitar playing and Jerry Reed style was your subject...this is the DVD to buy. Buster B is a master. Not only a master guitarist but an extremely masterful teacher. Just watching him play and listening to him speak, you get the feeling that you really want to know him in real life! Too bad he's gone, but boy...what a player!"
4,Nice cleaner,"this product will leave a slight shine on your dashboard (but not like if you would apply armor all) I really hate a SHINNEY dash, but with this product the dash manages to stay like new condition (CLEAN looking) for a long time, (20 days at least) (That's if you don't go around with your windos down)"
5,great table saw and good value,"I purchased the Porter-Cable 3812 with the folding stand and within 30 minutes of the box arriving at my house, had it setup and cutting wood. The stand is very stable and bolts to the base of the saw providing good support even on uneven surfaces. The saw rips through heavy stock with little hesitation. The sawdust is expelled out the back and it was easy to rig a PVC elbow to direct the shavings into a bin. The safety guard does not flip out of the way but it does have a spring steel retaining clip that provides for quick and easy removal of the unit. The outfeed support is a worthwhile addition to provide more room for material to be fed to the blade. The stock blade is adequate but a new Freud 50 tooth combo blade will provide a worthwhile upgrade. At $355 including the stand and shipping, the saw is a good value for the money."
5,A beautiful book.,"Though this work has been written about before as a sketch, I don't think these people,places, or heart rendering moments could fit together any better."
4,Wonderful little book,This book is full of timeless short stories that can either be read as a whole story or separately.
2,CHICK FLICK NOT A CAT FLICK,"The cat in the movie brings bad luck, and isn't seen much. This is more like SEX AND THE CITY, though without the sex, since it is Korean.Nice Korean locations, and movie is stylish without being too annoyingly arty. The story could take place anywhere, and it seems like the director was influenced by European and American movies, with a running down a hallway scene that recalls JULES AND JIM, and a plot akin to the Demi Moore movie, NOW AND THEN.No great shakes, but it's watchable."
4,"Compact , Creative Insight into Lives of Important Women","In case you don't have the time to accomplish the very important task of reading every single book written by influential women, this book is a wonderful way to become at least familiar with their philosophy, and where they stood in the context of their times. The accounts are lively and readable, and can serve as a reference for later on you when you might have time to explore more deeply the writings of the individual women who interest you."
1,Don't expect anything from the Warranty !!,"I was using it to paint a couple of rooms in my basement. The machine was brand new out from the box. Two hours later the tip of the gun went bust. I've never thought having any problem with the new machine, but I was wrong. I had to finish the rest with the roller. Later, I called tech. support explained the situation requesting a new tip (not the whole spray gun) He said the gun is not under warranty and I have to pay for a new one. (don't you just hate it after you paid [alot of money] for a new paint sprayer and then you have to pay more for broken part on your first use. ..."
5,wagner sprayer,Having used several different paint sprayers over the years. I think that for the amount of money spent that this sprayer is agood buy.I would recommend it to any home owner.
4,Worked Great,It worked great right out of the box. The only issue I had was the fact I had to fight the stiff hose as I moved around. I solved that problem by buying a swivel to connect the hose and spray head. It would be nice if the company would include a swivel with their product. Cleanup was slow until I started using a bucket of hot water and dish soap.
4,Very Thin Back-Pocket Bible!,"This is a little gem! words of Christ in red. You can put this in the back pocket of any pair of jeans! Very nice study preface, contents page, and in time of need reference. Print is about 7 pnts. Arial, so it is very readable; though for me I would prefer a more traditional Times type. Snap flap, brass corners, page protector front and back, very rugged. This is my suggestion to anyone who wants their first dedicated purse or pocket Bible. I am a biker, so size does matter, my only other choices would be the Brodman & Holman Compact Ref. Bible, or the Cambridge Compact.The former being thick... You won't be disapointed, and you certainly will be the envy of all your friends, as this Bible is very hard to out-class.This is the Bible for students on the go, or for those in the fast lane of life!"
1,Terrible Movie!,"What a terrible, ponderous, senseless movie. With Sharon Stone touted in the cast, one would at least hope for some attractiveness in the film, but she was painted with some kind of lip wound, and make-up did their best to hide her beauty. Nick Nolte was the typical anti-social drunk/druggie that he often plays, and Bridges was as hapless as he usually is. There was no identification with anyone in this movie, neither sympathy or pity, except, perhaps, for the horse. Skip this one; there is nothing positive or redemptive about it!"
2,Disappointed,"The Chicken Soup books have been a good read in the past. This one seemed to be the perfect Christmas gift for friends in recovery, so I purchased three copies (there were no reviews to assist my decision.) After reading some of the book, I quickly became disappointed. The stories seem to lack substance or the inspiration experienced in other Chicken Soup books. The stories described difficult events, but no insight as to how the individuals came to find peace and serenity. Basically it was, ""I had this situation, and now I don't."" In the future, I will wait until there are reviews to guide my purchases."
3,Not for Porter Cable,"I bought this stand after talking to Rousseau and being assured that the stand would work well with the Porter Cable 3812. Well . . . .they have included pre-drilled holes for the PC, but that's about it. You can't store the miter gauge on-board anymore (which means the cord storage is gone also), and the fence is in the way when storing upright (although you can move it). I was really disappointed, because this thing is built really well and would have been nice to have. Amazon is picking it up in the morning."
1,This item cannot be used with a 52 inch Hunter Original,"When this item was opened to be installed with the 52"" Hunter Original we ordered, the installer informed me that it could not be used since it was not threaded on both ends. This item is threaded only on one end with the other end having some sort of mounting hole. Perhaps it can be used on other styles of Hunter fans but not on the one we purchased. A quick trip to a local building supply outlet solved the problem with the purchase of the correct downrod which was threaded on each end.Amazon has very kindly and quickly offered a refund and I cannot say enough good things about how this was handled."
5,Stiff and Hard!,"This is a piece of metal. No moving parts at all. The only thing they could have screwed up was length, finish or thread. They didnt, the product came in great shape and it still works today!"
5,"from Reading, PA","I must say I own a few meditations tapes, but this tape is definitly one of my favorites. It has a couple different ones on, including a long version and a short healing light meditation. I think the best part of the cd is the music is awesome, it is very spirtual and takes you on a emotional journey that is hard to describe. It is a great meditation/music cd that will completely relax you."
2,Easy?,"John Daniels' robotically annoying voice is accompanied by really bad production which makes me think that he just didn't use a profesional. It is obvious Mr. Daniels knows all about meditation, the text is great but it is sometimes hard to hear it with the acompanying background music."
4,"Add Christmas Angst, Boyfriend, Family, and Stir","Emotional ties bound up in family Christmas traditions complicate but ultimately help strengthen the bond between two gay men, who are sympathetically portrayed, but sadly conceived along stereotypical cardboard-cut-out-gay-character lines. Why must the good-looking tall doctor be rich? Why must the suffering but sensitive hospital administrator (a hemophiliac no less) be HIV+? Why must a moment of unprotected sex be glorified as the impatient imperative of true love? Why must the form of the novel confuse several Christmas periods that shape the relationship? Better gay fiction than most, with honest observations about flash points in a budding romance, but ultimately a bit soggy with its own sentimentality."
3,I expected better from this writer...,"""Winter Birds"" was wonderful. ""Dream Boy""was nostalgically sweet. I haven't read ""My Drowning,"" but will get to it this coming year. Mr. Grimsley has a good track record.I really wanted to like ""Comfort and Joy,"" but I found it...fluffy. To be honest, it was an easy read...two sittings for me. But the characters were two dimensional and the love story (along with the requisite drama) was trite. It's a story we're all familiar with...1) issues of class and the pressures of equity, 2) the gay preoccupation with the beauty standard and how it plays out in relationship ""cache,"" 3) family, homophobia, and the expected clashes with queer life and love, 4) peripheral support from straight male friends and a lesbian couple...and so on and so on.Mr. Grimsley didn't write a bad novel here...just one I would not have expected from someone who wrote so eloquently in other works."
1,"Beaters locked up on 2 mixers! Cheap plastic, NOT chrome.","This is an overpriced piece of junk! I bought my first Dualit mixer in May 2011. I am not a professional baker, just a home baker who uses a mixer 1-2x per month and was looking for something that might last...thinking I'd get what I paid for. First I was disappointed that the ""chrome"" was actually plastic, but I can overlook that. Less than a month later, the beaters locked up and the mixer died. Amazon issued the exact replacement. 6 months later, the same thing happened. Now I'm past the 1 month return period, though the mixer has a 1 yr limited warranty, and I must deal with Dualit...not looking forward to that. Save your money...this is not a ""professional"", nor professional grade mixer by any means. I've had better runs from $20 mixers. Read the recent Dualit reviews...all of their mixers are failing for the same reason."
2,Upset.,"I have always loved how fast I get things from Amazon, and that everything is exactly how it is described. I bought this hand mixer for my Mom for mother's day. She had been going through a string of cheap mixers, and I thought that this heavy duty one would do the trick. One of the things that really sold me was the fact that it clearly states its 300w. Upon opening the package today right on the front it says 240w! This is not what I ordered nor is it what I want. I am disgusted. It should have clearly said it was 240W! Mother's Day is just around the corner, and now I dont know what to do. I hate that I am put in this position."
3,"Powerful and Good Looking, Quality Suspect","Bottom Line: Glad I bought it to replace a pathetically weak KitchenAid (the 7-speed digital), but it falls below the build quality standards you associate with Dualit.Pros:* Powerful and fast - whips egg whites in 1/2 the time it took my KitchenAid.* Comfortable to hold - large handle and good weighting make it easy to hold for long periods.* Looks good on shelf or on counter - Subjective, of course, but the retractable cord makes it neater and easier on the eyes.Cons:* Switch and cord retraction mechanisms have that vague, raspy feel of cheap components about to break. They may last forever, but they feel shaky out of the box.* Chrome surface is over plastic, which usually scratches. Mine has resisted moderately forceful attempts to scratch it (using a scissors point). At least the plastic is light in weight.Incidentally, whatever Amazon's information may show, this mixer's box claims 240 watts of power."
3,J.A. Henckels International Eversharp 8-Piece Steak Knife Set,"The knives are ok. No better or worse. Fine for the average slice of meat, but somewhat flimsy which makes it difficult to cut a raw potato in half."
5,"Good quality knives, reasonably priced","I have several Henckels Eversharp steak knives that are several years old and they continue to cut well and have survived many dishwasher cycles. I just added six more that I recently purchased from Amazon ($30)and expect similar performance from these. I also own a set of Henckels Four Star knives that are over 20 years old. They do not go into the dishwasher but need regular sharpening/honing. The steak knives are not in the same league as the Four Star line but they are very convenient (just toss in the dishwasher), relatively inexpensive, perform well and are fairly durable.My recommendation is to go with these knives if you are looking for a set of steak knives to be used on a daily basis."
3,OK for the price,"I got these for a Blues Brothers costume, and they worked well for that. I thought I could also use them as my normal sunglasses, but they're not very good for that. The lenses are pretty cheap, but they were cheap."
5,Takin it to the next,"I've followed Dig Ps since back in the day and have never stopped listening to their UNBEATABLE beats, rhymes and lyrical content. Sometimes the whole is greater than the parts (ie, Tribe Called Quest). Well apparently this part is as great as the whole. Ladybug lays down some crazy phat tracks in a great mix of genres. If you want pure hip hop you'll only get a few tracks of that here, but if you have an open mind or at least enjoy music from various genres then you will LOVE this cd. As original as you can get without loosing your audience, as accessible as the latest radio pop and with lyrical content to keep the philosopher and the thug happy."
4,"Girls, Cars, and Cash","""What it is,"" yo: the slums of Argentina, wicked cops, and two straight boys -- one who tries and one who dreams -- desperate to fall in love with a woman. Motivated by a gypsy's fortune (and to get the girl), the one steals, lies, and outwits the cops. As the story progresses tragedy escalates until the very end. I was impressed with the raw depiction of life as it really is out there, as subjects like death and its aftermath are handled well by Prince Charming and his girlfriend."
5,Braindrain,"This film displays how two determined young thieves, dream of saving enough money to travel to the United States, where their lives will be much better. These teenagers are dreamers and love to have fun. They find themselves in love with two local girls, who decide to join the trip to America, against all the odds. A very enjoyable film."
5,LOVE IT!!!,This is action packed! I love the backstories and learning about each character. I love the small town girl meets big time CIA. It's great.
1,Sight unseen...,"I really feel ripped of buying this episode!!! Want my money back. 20 minutes is not a complete show. My partner enjoy this show, but come on, this was awful and I'll repeat, a RIP OFF."
5,Good DVD,"If you're looking at this for the first time, the story lines are great. I have watched this series since it came out and everyone in the family really enjoys it, and that's why I buy the DVD's because most good series never stay on TV that long anymore."
2,great clamps but I ordered a 10 pack and received only one,"I had the same problem as others, I ordered multi packs of two different sizes of these clamps and only received one of each. The clamps seem to work well but they seem to have trouble filling orders for these correctly"
4,Fun stuff!,"If you were brought up on the Disney Zorro TV series, this might not be your cup of tea, but if you enjoy the old-time cliff-hangers, you'll love this one. Reed Hadley (real name Reed Herring) is great as Zorro. One episode includes the famous stunt by Yakima Canutt where (as Zorro) he climbs from the team of galloping horses under the stagecoach and back up to save the day. The stunt occupies only about 2 seconds on the screen, but it's a classic. It's been recreated countless times since then, mostly with trick photography. Watch for Clayton Moore (The Lone Ranger in the TV series) in a bit part as ""Fernando""."
5,More then I expected!,"I was reading this same book that I had borrowed. I wanted my own copy and found it on Amazon. I was so pleased when it arrived as it was much bigger then the book I was reading with larger print. This book was even easier to read. Thanks again to the seller as the book that was sold as used, looks like it was new off the shelf."
3,Teen-age enthrallment fades with time,"This seemed a rousing romantic tale when I read it many years ago, but it now seems rather cumbersome. The dialogue is stilted, not to say unbelievable; the characters are wooden, and that Ivanhoe should prefer the snobbish Rowena to the lovely and talented Rebecca is absurd. And King Richard could leap tall buildings at a single bound(!). Too much. Maybe 3 stars is too much."
4,Still excellent after all these years,"Scott is easy to read. Perhaps a bit heavy on the Latin, but you can figure it out. His Saxon comic, Wamba is most amusing. Just remember, the answer to everything is Pax Vobiscum. (lol) I love the discriptions of the castles of the time in his notes at the end. I didn't notice one OCR error which seem common in most of the free literature for kindle so that is a plus. This is a classic and it is what it is. Much better than the movie. I never liked Robert Taylor as Ivanhoe. The Anthony Andrews version is better and truer to the book. That is it. End review."
4,good,"very informative everyone should read this at some point. Amazing that this is over 200 years old, read it now"
1,Re: Faulty Product,"I bought this product on January 2012 for my 2000 Audi A4 1.8t Manual. I had it installed on 03/23/2012, and it worked on about 6 occasions, then it completely died. Anybody buying this product for a car like mine, don't. It does NOT work."
2,Leaks after 3 years,Not worth the money with all the leaks. Not sure why they have the cold water go through the faucet before it enters the tank. Makes install tougher. There has to be a tankless alternative. Dont bother with the Franke
3,little butler,lasted about 6 years of very light use. so if that's it for these type units well........ maybe another brand is better?
3,laser is not crisp,I bought this level last fall and have hardly used it. The bubble functions work fine but my laser is projecting a muddy spot at only 20 to 30 feet. It makes a square spot that is nearly 1/2 inch at that distance. I know it worked better when I bought it. I guess I need to call and see if an adjustment is possible.As for the top laser in the eye. You can rotate the black slotted screwlike thingy on the front to block the vertical laser. I discovered this by accident.
5,Smashing!!,Great read--nothing like this over the pond------I will see how this book works on the UK gents-------I recomend this book to all women all over the world-----------
4,It's an Entrepreneur's must see.,Every Entrepreneur needs to see this action packed movie. It will inspire and reenergize you leaving you with a fresh perspective on looking at your business. It provided wide diversity of ideas.
1,Creative Writing,"Colson's version of what happened during Watergate is a self-serving, sanctimonious whitewash of what he did and what he was responsible for. As the self-syled "" Go-to guy"" when something needed to be done. As Howard Hunt's boss, it defies belief that he was ignorant of what went on. He managed to get away without any responsibility for what he was surely guilty of and pled guilty to a crime of his choosing, which he hoped not to serve any time for.Surely to be ""Born Again"" he needs to tell the whole truth rather than this sanitized version."
1,Works well - but fails prematurely,"I bought this tool for the versatility, and the tool seemed to work well at first. However, after using the tool only a few times the tool failed (plastic gears inside). I am very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone. I was talking about it to a friend of mine who also had two of them fail only after a few uses. The first time it happened to him he thought it was just a manufacturer defect and being under warranty got another one. The same thing happened, so he returned it and got his money back...lucky for him it happened soon after he bought it. I bought mine about a year ago, so I'm out of luck."
4,I LOVE this cereal!,"I eat a low-carb lifestyle and in the beginning, I missed my cereal. I found this and think it's delicious! It has a consistency of grits more than regular oatmeal, but it is very filling and yummy. I usually add Stevia or my FAVORITE added ingredient is Walden Farms sugar-free, calorie-free Apple Butter. It's to die for!! I am definitely going to keep eating this product!"
4,Entertaining,"Having read the book, I was curious to see how close the movie would follow the story. Overall, the movie did a very good job. There were some artistic liberties taken, when aren't there, but these changes did not severely alter the overall storyline. I liked that the pirates were portrayed realistically and not softened up to make them come across like buffoons or simpletons. Eddie Izzard did a great job of portraying Long John Silver, so much so that I can understand how Jim Hawkins could be torn between like and detesting the man all at the same time. Will definitely purchase for my media library."
2,They changed the story and the ending!,"They took a classic piece of English literature and ruined it. The main part of the movie was pretty good and stayed fairly true to the book, but I was somewhat put off when Jim's mother was thrown out of her home with nothing and with nowhere to go. Then when they changed the ending into something ridiculous, that's when I blew my stack. I have read the book and I've seen other versions, and this is the worst.#1, after almost everybody dies fighting over the treasure, the captain was going to turn the treasure in to the government as contraband? Sure, that's why they risked their lives and fortunes, to end up turning the treasure in to the government! :-p#2, they decided to split it up between them instead, but Jim - who is going home to life of penury, throws it all overboard (what an idiot)! And the doctor helps him! :-p#3, they leave poor Ben Gunn on the island to spend the rest of his life all alone! :-pRead the book; it's much better."
2,Director seems to have lost the map,"Saw this on TV.Not so much as a hint of humour, the script shoots for deadly serious but achieves deadly dull. Over all this tries to make the classic Stevenson story more edgy and contemporary but it all ends up seemly forced and overdone. Far too ""post modern punk"" and not enough ""pirate"".I have been a fan of Eddie Izzard's film work and stand up but for this....""Meh"". Not a great casting as ""Long John"" IMHO. He mostly looks bored.Almost any other flim version of Treasure Island beats this.Two stars just 'cause I managed to sit through it."
2,Tone down the music!!!,"In the affirmations portion of this CD I found the music to be heavy, invasive, and downright annoying. It drowns out the narration. One cannot relax for straining to hear the words."
3,pleasantly bewildered,"We are enjoying the basic premise of the book. The two characters of opposite personalities and background struggling through to relationship makes for interesting reading. The problem with the book is the authors extreme overuse of a few discriptors - esp. 'sardonically' and 'wryly'. The overuse of these two words almost makes me want to throw the book away without finishing it. There are also other words used that normal readers would have no clue what they mean except in context with the sentence because the words were probably used 'back in the day'. Without these reading obstructions, I would have given the book 4 stars."
1,Don't do it!!!!!,It would be a great idea if the nail canisters were still available. Mytoolplace and Bostitch should be ashamed.
2,does include a listing of all available radio stations,"I sent it back because I wanted to find out where Howard Stern is in each city. book includes those old hacks, Don Imus and Rush Limbaugh, even Dr. Laura Schlessinger, but no mention of Howard Stern. With 20 million listeners, why leave him out?"
2,Thought Provoking,"Philosophers should enjoy this one. The story is about coming to grips about who you are, expectations and perceptions. This book can be insightful for some, but for me, a little dry. Forster did not foster a logical basis for Rickie to fall in love - or a hopeless romantic one for that matter. From there, the story lost steam."
2,Good from far ... far from good,"While it will be sufficient as a primer for entrants to the arcane world of the various branches of OTC derivatives especially in the fixed income area ...I suspect that many topics & inferences were plugged in from the author's many other publications which had been pretty prolific & churned out every other year ...I will only recommend it as an introductory book for the student or new professional, but probably not relevant if you are a serious (or half serious) practitioner looking to keep abreast with the competition or the academics, and hoping to find something which you already do not know nor hear about."
4,Good book about the developement Argentine Nationalism,"David Rock informatively reviews the late 19th century and 20th Century developement of the Nationalist ""Movement"" in Argentina. He explores the motives behind it and the relation it had with European contemporary politicians, philosophers, and artists. This book is politics, but it also shows the influence the Nationalist ideas had on Argentine culture."
3,"Polite, neat and controlled, if that's what you want.","These guys make high-quality music. Beautiful sounds, clever chords, trenchant lyrics. Fabulous recording quality as ever.When I'm in the mood for polite, neat, perfectly-assembled music - and don't forget that highly repetitive toe-tappin' backbeat - I'll listen to 'Everything Must Go' again. Maybe around October."
3,Another disappointment,"A bit disappointing compared to their old stuff (Nightfly and earlier), but much better then TaN, which had no memorable tracks. I don't understand why it won an award when it was clearly SD's worst album. After a few listenings, the only 2 songs on EMG that I like (so far) are the Mall song and the title track. The rest ranges from okay to forgettable. Perhaps after several listenings, others will grow on me.I was going to buy a ticket to see them on tour, but after this, I'll pass."
2,Don't waste your money,"If your looking for the ""GOOD"" Steely Dan stuff, keep looking, it's not on this cd. It's on the earlier recordings!!!"
1,"No Juice, No excitement, No Steely left in the Dan","""tell me where are you going, midnite cruiser"". Now that's a song with some inspiration. Walt and Don, where are you going and what have you done with Steely Dan?!?!"
1,steely dan >everything must go,"Just not one of my favorite steely dan cd's, & I think I have about everything they've put out"
4,"Good songs, poor engineering","Sorry, this is not a well engineered album. Listen to Nightfly or Aja or Gaucho. There is some dynamic range. I am surprised SD fell into the modern trap of compressing the hell out of everything until there is no life in it. Chromatic jazz means color, and trying to play the volume wars defeats it.Songs are interesting, not as good as Aja or Nightfly or Royal Scam or Countdown. I'd rate it about equal to Katy Lied.From a huge SD fan."
5,Another winner !!!,"Actually, I'd give this 6 stars if I could! These guys just keep getting better! A SD fan from day 1 (yep, I'm old!!!) I am amazed how they keep the top shelf quality of musicianship and song writing in all their work! I loved all of the their earlier LP's. AJA was my favorite until Two Against Nature came around (And rightfully took the Grammy!). And now they deliver another winner! There are no weak songs on this release! My personal favorites are the funky 'Godwacker', 'Pixeleen' (Anime girl ??), 'Lunch With Gina', 'Green Book' and 'Blues Beach', not necessarily in that order. But I play it from top to bottom over and over again! The music, the lyrics and background vocals are absolutely superb! Nice to hear Mr Becker sing on Slang Of Ages too! Don't miss this one!"
2,Everything Must Go,"I'm surprised how many of you loyal fans think this is good stuff. I think the guys didn't wait long enough before coming out with this one. The production and grooves are great of course, but it's pretty much devoid of great hooks and melodic CONTENT in general. And, yes it sounds mean spirited but please, please don't let Walter sing any more tunes! When I want to hear Fagen at his best I'll still pull out Nightfly or Aja, thanks very much. So the bottom line, if you're fan for over 25 years like I am, you'll have to have this in your collection. Just be ready to be kinda disappointed."
3,The sax that never quits!,"It's no wonder I had never heard of this four year-old album until last month. I'm a huge Steely Dan fan and there is no such thing as a ""bad"" Steely Dan album. This sounds like a rush job. Th worst sound quality of any of their albums. Of course worthwhile for the fan, but there is a sax that just wails ceaselessly throughout most of the tunes. Would like to hear the album without so much of that.Nevertheless, I have no regrets about getting it."
3,Nice bouncy grooves,"Well, Aja it ain't. Back when they were saying something,...they were something. Just the same, my ... toes won't stop tappin'. Even when they're off the mark, they make a nice record. Carlock's got an OK groove, but give me the studio heavies again. Don,...Walt,...they all sound like Tea House On The Tracks. (Three days later)OK, they don't ALL sound like Tea House."
2,"This must go, too!","You know how when you go to see a concert of a ""classic rock"" band, and they say ""here is something from our new album"" - and you cringe? Well, it's time to cringe here, too! Yes, the tracks SOUND like Steely Dan - but the lyrics are just a lot of fluff, and there are no real interesting musical parts to speak of.So, my advice would be - stick with the ""classic"" Steely Dan that we all know and love.--joe"
2,"Crusty, boring release from old-timers still certainly competent","2 1/2One of the Dan's more geriatric adult contemporary grooves, Everything Must Go holds very few genuine musical thrills, though they do manage to squeeze a few inspired passages, mainly revolving around their players soloing or an occasional chorus worthy of merit. I understand many of the groups older fan's may have grown with the band into this smoother, single-friendly sound, but the slick production only ends up magnifying the (relatively) dull songwriting. Fans of the band's jazzy influence will be able to find enough worth considering, but anyone weary of their slicker material on stuff they made even in their heyday may be more then a little depressed with these comeback albums."
5,Had a reason to finally use Amazon.co.jp,"Like many others, thought Matthew's last two albums were duds and self indulgent. Like on stage, he shines when interacting with other talent. Took a chance on this for temp living in Japan and got it for $13. Damn it is fantastic; every song is good and collectively it is sublime. Perhaps he will send the demos of the cuts that did not make the album to Lloyd Cole to hear if there is another super-hit like Girlfriend in the pile. I say 10 more great reviews on Amazon and Matthew will release this in the US..."
5,I love this movie so much I want to marry it...,"First, I'm thinkin' I would court it seductively. I would start by taking it out to a fancy dinner at Cheddar's. Then I would take her out to a movie and allow her to have anything at the snack bar she wanted as long as she didn't go over the $6 cap. Then after the movie, I would take her out for a stroll on the beach and say things to her like....""I'm that man"".""That's how I feel"".""We have so much in common"".and""Do you know where we can get this validated""?Seriously, how can anybody not like this movie? It wasn't trying for an academy award (that should have been given away with the midget in leather chaps and the hot female demon that also unfortunately has a penis). It was trying for goofy. Goofy is good. Stop looking for ""Citizen Kane"" and get off your high horse and smile you sons of bit...."
3,Smegma UNHAPPY with results,"For FM, this had NO EFFECT over the ""hanging T"" antennae -- RETURNED it.I gave it 3 stars for 3 reasons :1.) SOLIDLY built with QUALITY -- great DESIGN and LOOKS ...2.) BEST packaging seen in MANY years -- HAPPY without F**KING blister pack.3.) I didn't try it with local broadcast TV - only FM"
1,paper weight,not only does it not recieve any stations but it kills the ones i was already getting. i live within 10 miles of all the broadcasting towers with no obstructions. do not buy this
1,The book is reflecting the reality in a distorted mirror,The writer thought she has written about Israel. But actually she has written just about the things that her narrow perception has caught. The fact that she is very bright misleading to conclude she is reflecting the reality.
4,"Exciting, but familiar","A few years ago, I went through a period of time when I read a lot of Robin Cook's novels in a short amount of time. The plots and characters all started to run together, but his novels were still enjoyable.When I read this book, I was not disappointed. Dr. Laurie Montgomery and Dr. Jack Stapleton seemed like familiar old friends to me. Even though some parts of the novel were very predictable, seeing all of the threads in the book come together lead to a suprising ending."
2,no more Cook,"Well, I'm off of Cook permanently I think. I adored his earlier books-Coma was a benchmark for medical thrillers. But I can't possibly imagine anyone talking as his characters (Jack, Laurie and all the rest) do. His characters, while likable, are totally one dimensional. It falls into the thriller category only because we knew who the murder was, but not sure of how the individual would be caught. Otherwise I'd just consider it dull."
2,Fertility Problems,"I like the main character Laurie and I can empathize with her. I was thrown out of the story repeatedly though because of Dr. Cook's misinformation regarding fertility. Google fertility statistics for 43 year olds to see how improbable it is to conceive at this age without the help of fertility treatments and donor eggs. SPOILER ALERT: Laurie would have thoroughly researched this and concluded at the end to go ahead with some sort of fertility treatments or at least forced a conclusion to the romance one way or the other. Leaving them in a tentative truce re marriage and kids was lame. What's next? Laurie spontaneously conceiving at age 48 in the next book? That book would need to be titled ""Miracle""."
3,Wow. I hope this doesn't go on in real hospitals,"Laurie and Jack are forensic pathologists as well as a couple with a relationship on the rocks. She notices a trend of unexplainable deaths in a local major hospital and begins to investigate against the wishes of her own boss.Naturally she continues the investigate outside of regular channels and discovers a horrible secret.I found the story line interesting and fast moving but the characters seemed a bit unbelievable at times - the step from pathologist to action hero is a large one. The rude dominating boss is a stock character along with the hard-drinking detective.Clearly, Cook writes popular, fast moving stories. This one is also enjoyable."
2,Slow read!,"I usually like a book to start out with something that makes me want to turn the page....to continue reading. This book almost gets your interest, but is just too easy to put down. So if you like a thrilling read, turn to The Innocent by Harlan Coben, and put this book down."
5,Mark it an A+,"THE SETUPMedical examiner Lori Montogomery observes the unexplained death of a number of healthy young patients and suspects a serial killer. In a converging storyline, Lori breaks up with fellow medical examiner Jack Stapleton over his inability to commit to the relationship. That's the setup.COMMENTS--contains spoilersThe premise that a for-profit medical company is behind the deaths to reduce costs is implausible--mostly because such savings would be hypothetical and in the distant future. Such a scheme might be plausible if the cost savings was assured and in the immediate future.THE VERDICTThis is one of the best Cook novels. The characters are few, and the ""good guys"" are appealing, and well characterized. The plot is fast-paced, captivating, relatively straightforward, albeit predictable. The resolution is satisfying."
2,Yawn,I've read all of Robin Cook's books and usually enjoy them but this one drug on for FOREVER. I just wanted to get to the end to confirm what I already knew halfway through the book. It seems like he layed out all of the information that would keep you interested pretty early on. The he must have just kept writing and relized 200 pages later that the story had ended some time ago so he writes a lame ending and calls it a day. The most excitement happens in the last 10 pages. This book was a big dissapointment.
2,Would have been a good Novella,"Although Cook writes well enough to get you caught up in the story, Marker should have been a novella. The narrative is extended with irrelevent verbal confrontations, petty arguments and an unbelievable amount of medical jargon. Where was the editor?"
3,Bright idea !!! But not bright enough,"The whole idea of the light on the handle is great , but it does not give you the light you need to see the grill surface ..I have a weber genesis and love it but that is where there product highs end . Maybe the weber light testing department where tipping into the cooking wine a little to heavy the day of the testing of this light and maybe blacked out on the final results. I would not recommend this light at all UNLESS:::: Weber sends a free bottle of the party wine from the time they tested this dim bed side night light .Wake up Weber."
3,ONLY FOR WEBER GRILLS!!,I took one reviewer at his word and bought this for my Brickman gas grill with the round handle. It did NOT fit...flip flopped all over the place. Very disappointing since this type of light is an excellent idea!
2,the fun won't last,"All of the above reviews are correct. It is nifty, it iluminates the grill quite well, its a great gadget, etc.BUT I've had mine for eight months now, and by the third month, it started to loose its grip on the handle (because of the heat I guess), so much that it will not hold its own weight and slides so the light will not iluminate the grill anymore.When you close the lid, this thing is supposed to turn itself off automatically, it did that at first, now it stays dimly lit, so everytime I close the lid when grilling I have to turn it off, this kind of ruins the whole auto-shut-off feature.Please note that my grill is always under a roofed terrace and always with the plastic cover when not used.This product is not up to Weber quality standards, not even close."
4,A traditional book on cosmology,"I grabbed this book the first time I saw it and felt immediately drawn into reading it. It is not a book that breaks new ground. As pointed out by another reviewer, the stories of the Greeks, Copernicus, Kepler, Brahe, and Einstein are well known by anyone not new to the topic of Cosmology. However, that being said, I think the book is a worthwhile read anyway. Certainly, as an amature anstronomer I think the book belongs on ones shelf for reference if for no other reason.I would recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in the Cosmos. It's written for the lay person and for that reason gets my recommendation."
1,Doesn't make the case for the Big Bang,"When you get through the hype associated with mainstream physics you are left with trying to find logical support for its most cherished assumptions. Singh does no better than anyone else at propping up the fast fading concept of a big bang. At least 6 different assumptions, none of which can be proven, are needed to establish the existence of a Big Bang. Singh fails miserably in his attempt to find logical support for a Big Bang."
3,Pan,Pretty basic stuff- a review and historical overview from Ptolemy thru Tyco thru Leonardo etc. anyone who has done any reading in the field will find 95% of the book redundant.
4,well written,well written and interesting on the history and the people of cosmology. how they changed their thinking by asking questions and their successors continuing their work. from ancient greece to modern america. a good read.
3,Hard to find bright brass replacements,"I have previously used this item to replace a deck hand shower, that I have hit with my foot getting into the bath accidentally, 2 times prior. Unfortunately the handle is some sort of plastic and it has broken twice before. Also, unfortunately it is one of the only ones I could find in Bright Brass. Unbelievalbe. ( I will only order chrome fixtures in the future when redoing baths. What a racket - after 20 years you must change all your fixtures if you want them to match???) So I was thrilled to actually find this replacement on Amazon. Unfortunately, again, it was not in stock as advertised by the private seller. So good luck if you need one of these in Bright Brass. It would have been nice had the company not just cancelled but maybe recommended something else that might fit, in their cancellation email."
2,Not too good,"this is my second Gemma/Duncan book. I loved the first one, but this left me cold. I didn't like the magical elements (automatic writing, being 'pulled' toward the mountain, dreams that come true) and so I had trouble believing anyone's motivations, actions, or words. However, Crombie is a skilled writer and I will give another of her books a try before giving up!"
4,Really Cool,"I really liked Dragonaut. The animation is good, the story is fun, and there are plenty of great characters. It's not an entirely original story, but it's different enough to be interesting. what drives this anime is the strong bonds that the characters form with one another. The main character, Jin, and his girlfriend, Toa, are really cool characters. You really want them to find happiness. The animation in this series is impressive. There are lots of bright colors. It kind of has the Heroic Age vibe to it. If you have seen Heroic Age and liked it you will certainly like Dragonaut. If you haven't I recommend Dragonaut to any anime fan. It's well worth the reasonable price."
3,Action with a side of romance and cheese,"This is a B list anime meaning everything is mediocre with a few things here and there action,romance,anime and bewb fans can enjoy the trouble is will there be enough in it for you... I have watched all of it subbed and enjoyed it but it is pretty simple/dumb even for anime."
4,It's one of the best ALbums,"This is a pretty good CD. It's Weird Al, so you know it's hilarious. But I'm writing this review in regard to those who think Al is ""disrespecting"" Kurt Cobain. Look at when it was made people. 1992! Before the unfortunate death of Cobain. Plus as he always does, Al asked for permission before he wrote the parody. So, Kurt said it's okay and was quoted saying he, didn't know they ""made it"" until Weird Al parodied their music... Anyway, now that I got that off my chest I can say this is a must have for any true Al fan. Not his best in my opinion but still there's good Weird Al and great Weird Al, no bad Weird Al."
4,Witchfinder General - 'Death Penalty' (Heavy Metal),"Originally put out in 1982,this was the Witchfinder's first of two 'proper' releases.Top notch NWOBHM/doom metal to be fully experienced here.Best tunes include ""Invisible Hate"",title track ""Death Penalty"",the powerful ""Burning A Sinner"" and ""R.I.P."".Line-up:Zeeb Parkes-vocals,Phil Cope-guitar,Woolfy Trope-bass and Graham Ditchfield-drums.This is WELL worth checking out.Should appeal to fans of Iron Maiden,Saint Vitus,Saxon,Grim Reaper and possibly Candlemass.A should-have."
3,Not what I ordered,"I ordered a book with 3 stories in one but got one with only one story. Also, it was in acceptable condition. I never order anything other than very good. It was large print which I liked even though it was not what I originally ordered. I probably won't buy from this seller again. Also, it took a month to get. Terry in CA"
5,Great Book,I have read a great many books by Nora Roberts and always find them interesting and fast reads. This was no exception. And the deal I got on the book from Amazon was also great.
3,What can I say about a movie,"What can I say about a movie, it wasn't a great movie but it was ok. Take it or leave it."
3,Every Time We Say Goodbye... apparently that's a lot!,"Film doesn't really feel like it is set in WWII era, especially with Tom Hanks, and it is a bit slow. Although, a very sweet love story! It is everything you expect, and few goofy moments!"
1,"dated film, poor plot","I watched this with my three adult daughters. We generally enjoy period pieces, especially WWII titles. Because we are fans of Tom Hanks, we chose this film for a long awaited girls afternoon. I purchased the movie because I was so sure it would be bear repeated viewings. We all disliked the film. The heroine is completely inconsistent - totally unbelievable. We kept watching hoping that it would get better... it didn't. Not only will we not watch it again, but it has become a sort of slang measurement for how bad a movie is."
4,Great love story,"One of Tom Hank's early movies, Tom and Cristina Marsillach are great together. She a young Jewish women, He an American fighting for the British in World War 2 Middle East. Tha confilcts that arise because of religon and the war lead to a warn and troubled love. A real heart warming story."
3,Just Ok!,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie after all the great reviews on here. But I was dissapointed overall. Tom Hanks has always been my favorite actor. No one better. But in this, I feel he is just beginning to become the great actor he is today. Just ok, and sometimes it seemed as if he were reading his lines. Not much story to this, very thin plot. And the ending... terrible. I wanted some type of resolution. You don't get it here. Does he make it ok through the war? Does she wait for him? Does she marry her dumb cousin? Does her family totally disown her? I was almost waiting for there to be a ""to be continued..."" No one can beat Tom in the last twenty years. This is a yawner."
4,"Good, but not invulnerable","Got this for use in my crawlspace. The floor is very rough and littered with small stones, old screws and bits of wire from the scummy previous owners of my house. It rolls great on the rough floor and usually goes right over all the debris. Occasionally it will get stuck on something though, but I didn't expect anything to work perfectly in this situation.Good construction and very solidly built wheels."
2,Should have used Cardboard,"I read another review that using cardboard works good, I can confirm that. Used this on a truck in gravel and although it would move with effort over the gravel the cardboard in the end worked out much better and cost nothing. Its a monster size compared to other creepers and the huge wheel pockets make it difficult to work around. Try the cardboard in uneven surface and use the smaller creepers in the workshops."
4,Ride any surface creeper,"This creeper is excellent in durability, and function when it comes to outside work, I am a Diesel Technician, I usually work outside in all kinds of enviroments, this is the only creeper that gets around in rough suraces anything else you are better off with a piece of cardboard. This is my second one I owned, my first lasted my three years until someone ran it over with a forklift.However there is a trade off, it is not the most comfortable creeper. As the entire surface is hard plastic and not ergonomic is tough on the body anly one small paded section for your head, and is not enough padding.If you constantly working in a rough area this is the tool for you."
4,Not just for use under a car!,We have a construction business and bought this for getting around under houses!!! If you have had to drag yourself around under a house you will quickly see what a great item this can be!! I highly recommend this item!
1,I was embarrassed for this man,I love zombie stories don't get me wrong. I read alot of fanfic and truly do understand a work of love as opposed to writing to make a living. HOWEVER; this book would turn a zombie's stomach. It is that awful. I'm embarrassed for him. I actually read some of the paragraphs out loud to my husband to see if it is actually as BAD as it looks to me as I read it. It almost seems like a bad joke but it isn't. DON'T SPEND MONEY ON THIS BOOK. You'll be disappointed and god forbid we give any encouragement to this man. AND who the hell told him that the author picture on the back was cool? Jeez. Could you look anymore like an idiot? AND is that a nudie calendar behind him? I bet he lives in his mom's basement. This is just sad.
3,"Good effort, could have been better.","... Anyway, the book does have a compelling storyline with an assortment of characters that comes together in a morbid fashion. Yes, there are some weird things going on, but you know what, that is the world we live in. Sick, twisted, but amazingly horrific to say the least...."
3,Frustrating,"This book is valuable for providing little-known information about an important figure. Unfortunately, it is written at about an eighth-grade level. Those who read history seriously will be frustrated by the book's superficiality. It is difficult to determine what is documented and what is contrived for readability. The author states up front that he has created dialogue to make the book more interesting, but there is no way to tell which dialogue is created. For example, were those really Kano's last words? On the other hand, the photographs are terrific, and a time-line of events (at the end of the book) is very helpful."
3,SURPRISINGLY ENTERTAINING.,"An interesting early talkie, this film will give viewers a rare glimpse of the vivacious 48 year-old Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. In the same hotel, two separate parties are being held: one for a wealthy society named Vivian Benton an amateur aviatrix, the other a recognition dinner for successful stockbroker Larry Day. Amusing romantic issues ensue concerning the above duo. A superstar of silents, Fairbank's career in the movies waned with the advent of talkies: his voice isn't bad, just cartoon character-like. Another big star of the silents was Bebe Daniels: she to would see her career quickly fade by 1935. Directed by Englishman Edmund Goulding (DARK VICTORY), this 1931 feature remains a fascinating curio for those in the mood. Curiously enough, Fairbanks made a 1917 silent with the same title, of which this isn't a remake."
4,heavy duty & great features,"These are a really heavy duty set of legs for a horse. After getting them I also mounted them on a 3/4"" of 2'x4' plywood for a great utility table. They are beefier than I needed for a horse, but end up being great table lags. With only a small mounting area, they hold a fair size table very steady & support a ton of weight. A great base for a planting table, shooter's bench, etc. Not cheap, but super duty, good locking latch, and are shaped to fold nearly flat on each other so you don't need to take their thickness into account when you mount them. Very slick, mounting couldn't be simpler. I'd give them 5 stars if they were less than 30 bucks."
5,portable gun table,"ordered a set of the 34"" rugged buddy sawhorse legs,arrived in secure package and timely manner. Used them to make a portable Shooting bench.very stable"
1,deceptive marketing strategy,"I cannot come to believe that I have ordered this used book in the condition of ""good"" when it is actually in a critically damaged state. I definitely regret this purchase, and that in a high price relative to its unacceptable condition. Overall, I can only say that one cannot trust a simple labeling for it can bring about an unexpected book with folds, post-it notes, and a price unworthy for all its wear and tear."
5,awesome,great cd it's a cover CD but worth the money great renditions of Dylan songs. Ozzy has a great cameo. A must have for any rocker.
1,Lotta Screaming and Banging,"I bought this CD on the basis of a review that I read. I regret buying it. I don't know Mountain's history. The lead vocals are the harshest kind of screaming, the accompaniments bang and crash, much too harsh for my taste."
3,Mountain covers the King of the Mountain,"Mountain's Lesle West brings his signature hard rock guitar crunch and gravelly vocals to cover some of King of the Mountain, Bob Dylan's tunes.While West belts out his versions of classics like 'Blowin' in the Wind"", ""Everything is Broken"" and of course ""Masters of War"" with wailing guitar and gritty vocals, he never comes close to capturing Dylan's genius for delivering the irony. ""Masters of War"" of course, is an anti-war album but recently I heard about a poll that stated male classic rock listeners, who would listen to Mountain or say Zepplin ,were actually more right wing in their views. Go figure."
4,"Good Book, Great Series","Counting two previous novellas, this is #19 in Robb's In Death line.I tend to prefer the serial murder stories in this series, and this was a solid entry. With the first murder, you see a little more of usual police procedure: Dallas working the case but not really getting anywhere, not enough information to solve anything yet. And is shows why she IS such a good cop: she keeps working it without reward, doesn't give up.I like all the interaction around Peabody gearing up for her detective's exam.And on the personal side, SPOILER ALERT: Dallas has a significant memory of her mother, which nets two realizations. First: the character's self discovery that she had an unconscious private fantasy that a loving mother might be out there somewhere - a situation probably exacerbated by Roarke's mother-revelation in the last book, Portrait in Death. Second: the reader realizing the probable reason for Dallas' rejection of all things traditionally feminine.Good read."
4,Where are my friends?,"I do think J.D.Robb broke away somewhat from many of her characters, almost all of them in fact. I kept wondering where Feeney was and McNabb was talked about but that's about it. Perhaps she's trying to show that Eve is becoming more independant than ever, that she's learning to lean on others more yet at the same time herself.We did get to spend time with Mira though! That's always nice ^^"
4,Amazon does it again with Kindle book Imitation in Death,"I am totally hooked on Kindle books. And I am a fan of J.D. Robb. Imitation in Death is a J.D. Robb book and Eve Dallas and Roarke are so likeable and so good together that they sometimes feel real to me. So, keep 'em comming Amazon you are the best around."
5,Great,"As with all her death series, this one is wonderful. Each book can stand and be read on its own, but it's better to start with book one and keep on reading. The characters are wonderful and to watch them change is wonderful. Especially the character of Eve. She went from a basic loner to having a whole adopted family, and that confuses and fustrates her to no end. It adds a element of humor not really expected, but very much enjoyed."
1,Not so much.,"I'm surprised by the other reviews and by it being on the bestseller list. Did we read the same book?? Anyway, this is the first book in years that was actually hard for me to pick UP. Sorry to say but it just wasn't all that good. I thought she tried too hard and it fell flat. The characters too cliche. The main character especially was portrayed as a combination of tough as nails police chief who's seen the worst of it by day and sexaholic wife at night (who at their age has sex 3 or 4 times back to back in one night, I'd like to know)- which just didn't fit at all. I found it conflicting. And the descriptions of the violence is just a little too detailed in a perverse fixated way. Not so much. Sorry. Wish I had liked it."
5,Very heavy duty!,This product was shipped quickly and appears to be very well constructed. It's much nicer than I expected for the money!
3,Once installed hard to remove,"This works fine to hold knives, scissors, bottle opener, etc. The only problem is once you install it it's hard to remove without ruining it. The covers that go over the screws to conceal them are meant to go on & not come off. I was in the middle of a kitchen remodel & this went up before paint with the idea being it would be easy to remove & reinstall. Other than having to paint around it & it living where it was originally installed it's great."
5,Love it!,"Pros:The magnet is sufficiently strong to hold my 3 large chef's knives, 2 smaller knives, and a pair of scissors. I could probably fit one more thing if I put everything closer together.Cons:The installation was ok in large part, the only problem was that the anchors that you put into the drywall wouldn't go all the way in. They would go mostly in, then the last bit would crumple up instead of going into the wall. I ended up cutting off the excess plastic that didn't make it's way into the wall. You could alternatively just use your own anchors though."
1,Ineffective,"I bought this based on the reviews. After mounting on my wall, my knives just slid off. This is not a safe way to store knives. I recommend taking your chance with a different product."
5,"Looks nice, but installation not so smooth","This product looks nice and does a good job of holding up the knives without holding so hard as to worry about damage. It's hard to tell from the picture, but the top and bottom edges have 1/8th inch rails, so the knives do not sit flush in the middle of the design. This helps keep the knives and the bar clean and dry by minimizing contact.There were not installation instructions. The plastic screw anchors are an unknown size. I couldn't get them to go in with 1/4th inch, but 5/16th worked, although the hole was a little big and one accidentally pushed through the wall. It's a french company so I'm guessing it's a 7mm drill size."
5,Excellent quality product. Great space saver,"For a small kitchen, this knife magnet is a must have. It holds very strongly even our largest japanesse style knives. We even have serving silverware attached to it."
2,"15 inch Magnet, only 12 inches work","The product has a very sleek look. 12 inches of the bar work perfectly, even strong enough to hold my 9"" sharpening steel. The 3 inches on one side of the bar are not strong enough to hold a paring knife."
5,"Holds up 5 knives, a honing steel and kitchen shears, no problem","Bought this a year ago and installed it myself. I can't remember if I used the included hardware (I don't think I did) but I've had absolutely zero issues with it. It's strong, sturdy, and looks good. It holds a chef's knife, bread knife, kitchen shears, a heavy honing steel, two paring knives and a rather crappy steak knife. I've noticed that some areas are slightly more magnetic than others (for example, the middle seems to be more than the ends), but I just put the paring knives on the ends, since they need hardly any magnetic force. Works great! I would totally buy this again. It's held up very well so far."
5,Really Nice Knife Holder,I'm really happy with this product. It saves space on your countertop and it adds a classy touch to the kitchen.
3,You would never know what brand bar this is....,"MIU France is great marketing, made in China, based in Hong Kong..... France? The product works well, fit and finish is pretty good overall. The box it comes in looks like something you would buy from Harbor Freight. Very Generic no MIU France reference anywhere. It made me google MIU France to see if I got a knock off. Amazon says 18/10 Stainless, the box says Made in high quality stainless steel.... Guess I will take their word. We will see how it holds up in my Lance Camper. It can get pretty moist in there during the winter months.Magnet is ceramic and holds very well yet easy enough to get the knifes to twist off."
3,The magnet is too strong,"I have the 20"" model of this rack, and I, like others, strongly recommended it over MIU's 15"" model. Yes, it is euro-attractive. But the strength of the magnet all but rips it out of your hand when you place a knife on it. A strong magnet is great for firmly holding your knives in place (it will effortlessly hold up my Fantes Solingen meat cleaver, which weighs in at 15 oz). But, such a strong magnet also makes it difficult to safely and carefully peel your knives off of the rack without damaging the blade edge. This is why I wouldn't purchase it again, and would look at other racks instead."
2,"Very good product, if you use cheap knives.","This knife rack is not for the serious cooks with good equipment. The knives rest directly in the metal and every time you put your knife on this rack, if you are not careful, you can damage your knives. If you are just a regular, cook at home person with walmart knives, this is perfect.As far as the construction, I can't complain much. It's unuasally heavy and hard to mount. The mounting hardware is very cheap. Also found it very hard to level out due to the weight and garbage hardware.Again I say if you are the run of the mill at home cook, this will do the job for you. If you are serious about cooking, DO NOT buy this. Spend the extra money and get something that won't ruin your beloved knives."
5,Magnetic Knife Holder-works like a charm,"I'm very happy with this knife holder. It is very durable, pretty, and has very strong magnets. The mounting was simple, and the finished product looks very nice. I recommend it."
3,"Heavy, effective, poorly made?","This is just a giant magnet with a cute metal wrapper. It's not terrible looking, but it is very heavy. Giant magnets are heavy. It holds multiple heavy knives securely. The fit and finish is not so great, I'd say average. If you're looking to save counter space and replace a big wood block of knives, this is a good way to go.Definitely make sure you have all of your parts if you order. Mine is missing one of the screw covers. Looks janky."
1,Poor Construction,"I am surprised by the good reviews. The fretts are very crudely constructed and the ends are sharp. Within the first minute, my son's guitar teacher said that he would likely cut his hands. Sure enough in his first lesson he cut his finger. This is really a very absurd defect. Also, the connection wire to the amp came apart after a week. Too much of a pain to find a box to return this. Will end up in the trash!Barcelona Kid's Mini Electric Guitar with Amplifier Combo - RedBarcelona Kid's Electric Guitar Set with Amp - BlackBarcelona Kid's Electric Guitar Set with Amp, Gig Bag and Accessories - Blue"
5,Delicious! Perfect for those of us who love cinnamon rolls!,"This fudge is so much fun and delicious! This is one of my personal favorites. If you like cinnamon rolls, you will love this fudge... Order yours today!"
5,"With a name like Fluckers, it's GOT to be good!","Great product! When my pet pill bugs hear the lid of a new jar crack, they come running! Witha name like Fluckers, it's GOT to be good!"
1,"""smelly, moldy, meldewy!!!!!""","Delivery was very quick. But when it came, it was very smelly. Smelt like mold and meldew. When you opened it, it had white specks all over it that could brush right off, but the stench was totally unbearable! I contacted the company, they sent another one, with return postage for the first one. Second one was the same! They credited my account for the purchase amount but not the postage! The box itself is very pretty and just what I wanted, but can use it because of the stench!!!!!"
1,Yuck,"I also threw my box out because of the mildew smell. I thought it would go away - I really loved this box, but smell never went away and I couldn't stand it any longer. Unfortunate."
4,Still listening,I like the music but I'm still listening for some hidden gems I can really get hooked on - I wish the lead singer didn't have such a whiny voice! They need Scott Stapp...
5,More guts than brains,"Couldn't put it down. Brian says during his daring adventure""If you live through a trip like his you are considered brave, if you don't you are a fool."" Brian and his brother Dave manage a Jules Verne like adventure in the heart of america, but it's not fiction!!!"
1,Hard as a rock,"this product is supposed to be a paste, not a crystalized rock. can looked sealed, guess they will sell their old product to anyone. terrible!"
4,works well enough for intended job,"Got this for 2008 Honda Odyssey third row. It fits after cutting off the edges. The color is not a good match for the stock interior. I'm not sure if I had it to do over again that I wouldn't buy a black mat instead. But I'll probably end up spending the extra money and buy the custom rubber mats from Honda so they'll be a perfect match and fit. You definitely get what you pay for when it comes to custom fit and color.If you don't care about custom fit and color then this mat will work great... it's very durable, the price is low, and there are multiple guides for cutting it to fit anything from a full size Chevy down to a minivan."
5,Canning Jars,These jars were just what I needed for a juicing project. These were the largest I could find still in production. Price with shipping and everything was FANTASTIC! Got here in just 2 days. What more could you ask for?
1,A dated interpretation!,"As a disciple of Freud, Zweig was fascinated with the new psychoanalysis and applying it to historical characters. I think he overdoes it in his biography of Marie Antoinette, attributing her love of clothes, gambling, and partying to supressed desires rather than youthful vivacity, since she was a teenager, married at fourteen. This is a book that has outlived its time. Unfortunately, Zweig's Freudian interpretation has been imitated by other biographers and gives a false view of Marie Antoinette even to this day."
1,What Happened?,I cannot believe I sat through this waiting for it to get better. I guess you spell 'stupid' S-P-L-I-C-E. Save your money. If you have to watch it -warning- there is a rape scene. What was the purpose?
2,The 7-11 of it's genre,"Like 7-11 it offers a few basic necessities, but much like 7-11 it falls flat overall."
4,Not your run-of-the-mill horror film,"Certainly not your run-of-the-mill horror film, ""Splice"" tends to fall into the thinking man's sci-fi/horror hybrid ala ""Moon"" as another recent example. It's not really all that scary especially when you've already seen the trailers and know what's going on. It can also be compared as a modern day ""Frankenstein"" where scientists mess with Mother Nature.In general I liked the movie. However the film creates this interesting creature but focuses too much on the external elements of that act rather than on how she/he might evolve. Still, you have to like it for some technically excellent filmmaking and a different sort of thriller.The Blu ray is presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio and transferred in 1080p. The film has a full range of color but the muted browns and indoor shots look particularly good if a bit soft. The audio includes DTS-HD MA 5.1. It is clear and concise even with the quiet scenes. The LFE channel doesn't have much activity."
2,Splice should be Sliced,"Perverted piece of junk. Same old man creates super intelligent creature. Usually, the creature will start out obedient, innocent, afraid of the unknown, and so on. Now they are super intelligent, no longer obedient, unafraid, and so on. Of course scientist are always curious of what if pushed to the limit, can they accomplish with hopes of outstanding results. Man of course, is never satisfied with leaving somethings alone to the undiscovered.Of course, its evident what will be the outcome most likely in this film. I usually like Adrien Brody in some of his movies, but this film left me a little distressed with him. Attracted to a creature that resembled a child with child like curious behaviors, was perverted. Even his character struggled with his feelings toward her, but eventually gave in. He and his fellow female actor did not have much of a connection to me. This picture left me disappointed."
3,Wow great! Oh no!,"I was in awe at the beginning of the movie until they move to the barn. Then it just got ridiculous. Loved the special effects, but they killed the story from about the middle to the end."
2,Fooled me...,"Darn... I was looking forward to this one: a smart, well written 'adult' screenplay; thoughtful, intelligent story; some good sci-fi tension; a few scares perhaps; and terrific acting by (at least) Adrien Brody. Unfortunately, not one of the above panned out. The story had so many silly holes and turns that it became somewhat embarassing (for the writers and director). The ending was simply ridiculous. There were so many 'eye-rolling' 'how could they've been so stupid' scenes throughout, that I developed a mild headache. I won't go into any of the lame scenes and thin turns I'm referring to. If you want to take your chances... go ahead: you'll know what I mean. Darn."
3,Interesting Movie,"Very interesting movie with a lot of suspense and a curveball ending.. Not for everyone, or every audience. Very creative plot line though, very out of the ordinary and original. Some scenes not for the faint of heart."
1,You liked it...... seriously?,"I don't understand who can think this movie was good, or even not horrible. In just one night 2 scientists are able to create a new life form (easier then making a cake), They sneak it out of the high security bio lab (in a cardboard box).Then they have sex with it. Yes a real horror classic."
1,Splice was two hours lost that I will never get back,"I do not understand it!! This movie received rave reviews. Even Roger Ebert, a critic against this type of genre, gave this movie high marks. With much convincing, I brought my girlfriend to see it. The movie's premise was interesting, but the movie was dull, annoying and the actors were very one dimensional. Cardboard cut outs will do a better acting job. I wish I had my money back, when this movie was over. The ending stinks. It left you hanging, so you have to probably endure another two hours of dread and boredom with a sequel in the near future. Oh boy!! Can't wait to cross that movie off my list to see, when it comes down the pike. Very disappointing to say the least."
5,hasn't arrived yet but i saw it in the cinema:cutting edge in real terms,"contraversal for real almost possible , no paramiltary or crime scenes , rodney from stargate universe, beautiful canadian country, heart renching at times with the new lifeform, traditional boundaries are crossed in a few ways sci fi poetry, when will my copy arrive . Tiger"
3,SPLICE OF LIFE,"SPLICE is of course a Frankenstein for the 21st century and once again warns DON'T MESS WITH MOTHER NATURE! Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley are excellent in their leading roles, with Oscar-winner Brody showing his versatility. Delphine Ceneac (sp) is remarkable as the ceature known as Dren, a truly unique ""monster"". An interesting albeit predictable script and inspired direction make SPLICE an enjoyable sci-fi movie. The controversial and predictable ending keep it from 5 stars, but it is a well made film."
1,Awful!!,"Way too much purposeless gore. Completely unsympathetic and unlikable moronic characters who were totally unbelievable as scientists. To top it all off a disgusting mutant rape scene and completely predictable ending.Another reviewer said it best, ""That's two hours of my life I'll never get back!"""
3,"Splice - Appropriate Title, Because Film Steals From Many Predecessors","This movie is a combination of Frankenstein, ET, Gremlins, and similar films. It is moderately entertaining, although the lead characters -- including the animal-human hybrid -- are excruciatingly painful and annoying to watch. Gosh - I wanted them all to die throughout the film. Yet, I still made it through. The 1- and 2-star reviewers are having histrionic fits over nothing. Ignore them."
4,Easy to install and work well,These alarms replace several 8 year old alarms from a different vendor. I had purchased a few other kidde alarms earlier in the year and these seem to work alongside them fine.The nightlight was bright when I tested the alarms.These wire in very easily to our existing wiring. They use the same connector as other Kidde devices and didn't require re-wiring when I decided to move around our existing alarms.
3,Good Value Set,I only got this set because it was a special value. I would have preferred that the handles were more rounded. It makes me feel like I'm using plastic knives.
1,Y2K Problem,"Yeah, I lost thousands because there were three zeros in the year. I'm so glad it's never going to be ""Y2K"" anymore. What a bunch of bull****."
2,An OK place to start ...................,"This book is well-intentioned, with a great title that it doesn't quite live up to.I found it a bit superficial, and would instead refer you to Second Acts, by Stephen Pollan and Mark Levine. It too has room for improvement, but life circumstances vary and trying to help everyone is never going to be an easy task in one book."
1,Broken when arrived,I got a few things as stocking stuffers that were quite a disappointment. The Shock Gum was broken upon arrival and had to be just trashed.
1,This will make your family and friends hate you...,"This ""funny"" gag delivers a powerful shock that will make your family and friends hate you. It is even unsettling if you are prepared for the shock. Try doing it to yourself 5 times in a row and see how fun it is. My sister still complained of pain 30 minutes after I played the trick on her. If you have a morbid sense of humor and you take joy in the suffering of others, then you will like this toy, but if you are normal, you won't.I can't believe some of the other reviewers let children play with this, nevermind 4-year-olds!"
1,would not buy it,"broke with in first day just buy using it not pulling hard none of that, just a bad product mabye if i could get a new one and try it agian my tought would be better and i might recemond it but for now do not buy it"
3,"""All I want is to get my melons in.""","I was able to catch this on Comcast ON DEMAND a couple weeks ago. Never heard of it before, probably will never watch it again (and certainly will not purchase it), but nor was it a waste of 103 minutes either.Bronson truly had quiet power. Not sure about Lee Purcell's character here (Wiley); I guess she was just around as eye candy. 5 stars for Paul Koslo, who could play the slimy creep in his sleep, not too dissimilar from the other role I know him from, 1971'sVanishing Point. Al Lettieri was fun to watch, too, although it took me a while to peg him as Sollozzo (the ""Turk"") fromThe Godfather - The Coppola Restoration. He's heavier here, plus the 'stache.Directed by Richard Fleischer, ofSoylent Greenfame. Score by Charles Bernstein.While both plot holes and plot devices abound, this film should be good for one solid viewing. And there is a fantastic car (actually, truck) chase that Ford should have used in their commercials!"
5,Mystic Moods,Have a number of their albums and they are alldownright enjoyable.Turn the light out or down low kick back and justlet yourself go for a trip.
2,Long and drawn out.,"Talk about information overload.. this book could have been half its length. The plot is great; people start experiencing flu-like symptoms but unlike the flu they convulse, bleed out and die. Beck Casey, the central character, is called on by the President to help deal with the unprecedented emergency. The virus, much like the Spanish Flu, has hit Florida and Moscow. Russian President Putin orders the gassing of people in his affected area. The death toll will be in the hundreds of thousands. I read so many positive reviews for this book so I was pretty disappointed when I read it."
4,Obscure cuts and rare treasures!,"If you're an oldies fan trying to recreate your teenage music on CD, this will fill in some of the obscure memories. It's apparently from England and so contains some unfamiliar groups, but a lot of the US cuts are unobtainable anywhere else!! I had given up hope of ever seeing Karl Hammel, Johnny Dee, Deane Hawley and others on CD, but be sure to check the titles!!"
5,A big Help,"I found this book was filled with practical advice on how to include description and settings into my writing. This is a well writen book with easy to do exercises and techniques.Description & Setting: Techniques and Exercises for Crafting a Believable World of People, Places, and Events (Write Great Fiction)"
1,Just Plain Bad,"I now own the entire Write Great Fiction series, and this is one of two that just shouldn't have been written. (The other is the book on revising your novel, which includes maybe two or three chapter that actually address revision.)What was the author thinking? The text winds around and contradicts itself, the exercises are just plain stupid, we learn far more than we need to about the author himself, and although he gives us far too many of his own examples of descriptions, he fails to tell us how to write our own. I actually have a headache from reading the book.I also have a gripe with the author's choice of ""good"" and ""better"" words. He's so freshman-English cliche, I expected him to give me an example like, ""The yellow waves puked and giggled beneath the angry purple purile sky.""Avoid this one. There are books out there that actually explain how to write successful description."
2,The weakest link.,"Although this volume is part of the excellent ""Write Great Fiction"" series, it's really for those who wish to write mediocre fiction. Grab the other volumes (Characters, Emotion and Viewpoint; Plot and Structure), but skip this one. It's riddled with spelling mistakes, inaccurate quotes and is downright self-contradictory. On top of it all, the suggestions are, at times, poor and there seem to be sections drawn from high-school english lessons just to fill space. It's a struggle to get through."
2,one time use,"My 3 year old and I played with this toy today. The paint is in the brush, but it is very difficult to squeeze it out. I ended up squeezing big globs out for my child to spread. She enjoyed it once we used that method. I at first wondered why it only came with 3 pieces of paper, but we found out shortly that we only needed 2. We made 2 paintings, and we drained all 3 brushes dry doing so. It was a 10 dollar one-use-only toy. Maybe we'll use the paper for another color wonder product. My advice is to buy some good washable paints and real brushes. It'll be a better experience for you and your child."
2,Inadequate illumination,"I purchased this Sony ring light for use with my DSLR A700 camera specifically for macro botanical photography. I learned immediately that there's inadequate illumination to shoot hand-held closeups of plant species in shadows; the reason I bought it. Regretfully, plants move in wind. Even minimal wind. Accurate manual - or automatic - focus while using the ring light is just about impossible in anything other than absolutely calm conditions - a situation seldom encountered. I'm back to using a mirror held by someone else to direct sunlight toward shaded subjects."
3,So so...,This was an okay book. I'm not really into short stories. I only read it because it had gotten such good reviews. It is a book about life and life experiences and because of this it is slightly depressing.
3,"Beautifully Written, but Cold at Heart","These stories are gorgeous, beautiful pieces with a lot of charm and bittersweet flavors. However, not one of the characters seemed someone I would identify with or care too much about. They all seemed to be controlled and as cold as their northern settings. I understand why readers would admire Munro's writing style and even enjoy these stories, which are all very carefully written with a certain wry fatalistic viewpoint. Munro's truly skilled and talented, but I like to feel a bit more for the characters I read about. I can't tell if the stories didn't live up to the hype, or if they just weren't for me. Because certainly there isn't a lot to criticize with Munro's prose. She's an astute observer and wonderful writer; these particular stories just didn't grab me as I hoped they would."
3,Not her best by a long shot,"I was disappointed in this collection and was surprised to find so many critics raving about it. Her plot devices here seem forced and amateurish. (Most evident in the title story and in ""Tricks."") Her writing has always been based on interesting coincidences and chance meetings years down the road, but they are becoming more and more unbelievable. Also, her themes are getting tired. They seem to be constricted to tales about cheating wives, spinsters, and poor farmgirls. For better Alice Munro, try ""Friend of My Youth,"" ""Open Secrets"" or any of her early collections. Three stars because she is still the best writer out there."
3,Prety Good show,"interesting situations within the story telling&whatnot. some of the show gets a Bit too Polished&Hollywood shined for it's own good&that is why It's missing smething. the acting is cool&the story lines are cool. the chicks are smoking as well.but it has some short comings.it's getting a ""Sex in the City"" type of Blueprint in a way when it should be seen as more of It's styling&whatnot."
2,Not what I expected,"I heard that this show was the lesbian version of Sex and the City which is not at all true. They don't delve into fashion at all. The show is mostly about lesbian relationships which is great, but the story line wasn't believable.But I must admit that I still purchased Season 2 because there's something addictive about it..."
3,Beautiful people indeed,"I never saw so many gorgeous ""lesbians"" in my lifetime. There is not an unattractive one in the whole lot. Okay, this is a TV show so I'll pretend I'm okay with the beauty factor. The show was well-made, very pleasing to the eye for the most part and I enjoyed seeing the seedier neighborhoods of LA. On the other hand, both Jenny and Marina (especially Jenny though) got on my nerves quite a bit and I wanted to slap Tina around frequently. I agree with the reviewer who said Pam Grier's talents were wasted. Jennifer Beals plays an annoying character (Bette) but it is mostly realistic and she is so beautiful you want to watch her all day long. Dana and Alice are type-cast as providing the lighter side and the comic relief. As for Shane, I am not quite sure what to think. All in all, it had me sitting in front of the TV for a long time so it's worth giving a try."
1,It sux!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I thought it would be nice, but it was too bad that it was really starting to get dusgusting and boring. It is very predictable and I dont recomend it for anyone. Such a waste of money, buy something better.I couldn't bare having it in my room so I broke it and threw it in a huge garbage next to our house. Hope this review stops u from buying it, dont repeat the mistake that i've done.AWFUL SHOW!!!!!!!"
3,Love is love is love,"I have bought every season available for the L Word. The series is a must have staple in a lesbians video library (and for those who love lesbians). Only one complaint, the discs in the two seasons I've ordered from Amazon have skip areas in them or the dvd stops for whatever random reasons. I've cleaned the discs and the dvd player and still the skips. I will not be purchasing season 4 from Amazon but will spend the extra money and buy it from the L Words website directly. I hope that stops the misery of the skipping/stoppng discs."
3,Production could have been way better.,"But the music is incredible. Joe is the man on the guitar, but the camera spent just as much time on the bass player and drummer as they did on Joe. I didn't spend money to watch the backup players. Don't get me wrong, the backup guys were awesome too, it's just that I didn't pay to see them. Overall, Joe puts on a great show, and I'm anxious to see him in October when he come to Atlanta. I bought this DVD to get a preview of what I might get to see, and I'm excited. I would just say he needs to find new producers for future DVDs. It was hard to watch."
3,not the joe i know,"i have enjoyed joes c.d's including his blues cd's so i was looking forward to this dvd to get an up close and personal look at this fine guitar player and i am a bit disappointed, while he is very tasteful and his leads are well thought out on his cd's this is just an hour of a guitarist showing off. yes he is very fast and he has a boatload of chops but this gets old and repetitive after about two songs. comparing the song blues deluxe from the cd to this dvd is night and day. on the cd he starts off tastefully and quiet and lets his guitar build momentum. on the dvd it is in your face from the get go. overall a major disappointment from a talented young superstar."
1,a mind bending waste of time,"This early movie is I guess some sort or artsie nonsence, as it has absolutly no story line, and at times it's not only weird, but plain psyco, with some occasional downright disturbing footage. I suppose there is a sort of barely discernable romantic theme, but it's not unlike a Dali concept as far as that is concerned.One can't help but scratch ones head after watching this movie, and wonder what the heck you were just wasting an hour on. The only reason I give it a single star is simply because of the age and it's place in French History, whatever that might be. No doubt people at the time would have been hard pressed to even give it one star.This is one bizzarre movie"
4,1st live action by Hideaki Anno,"After his animated masterpiece ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"", japanese director Hideaki Anno tried for the first time to produce a live action film. ""Love&Pop"" is based on the book ""Topaz II"", from the author who inspired the erotic film ""Tokyo Decadence"", and is an excellent product with an amazing use of digital cameras and very deep dialogues. If you love Anno's style, you should not miss it!"
5,Good but whats next?,"Love this album but I'm waiting for whats next, its about time for that next album!"
5,Boogy,MMy son loved the costume of Robin the stores didnt have his size they said they didn't want to order it any more because they were making Robin a girl
2,"very cute, but cheaply made","My son is 3 and can pass for a 4 year old, so we bought the toddler size and it is VERY Snug on the shoulders but he loves it, that being said we have another week or so before halloween and I can not let him wear it until then because the seems at the sleeves were unrolling (very bad) so after halloween he will be aloud to play in it for as long as it lasts (which will not be long) I love the style and is just what I was looking for just wish I would have gotten a bigger size being as he likes to dress up as heroes and also wish it was not so cheaply made so he could have more fun with it- but for what we need it for (simply going trick or treating) it was a very great find....as long as he does not grow any for another two weeks."
3,My teen titan,"My oldest son is in the the Teen Titans right now and Robin is his favorite. The costume is a little big and the eye holes were too small , but we fix it so it was fine for Halloween."
5,Michigander,Great product. I have purchased two and will purchase at least one more. It is a convenient way to manage the bulky extension cords in my workshop and garage. Two minor issues: the optional swivel mounting bracket should not be optional; the bag could be better attached.
4,Great!,"This is a great product. However, It did not come with the swivel bracket as shown in the picture. Had to call the factory to get one."
1,mount,The mount shows that it pivots in some pictures. The ones that I received did not pivot = very disappointing.
2,Wonder Winder needs its swivel,"This was my second Wonder Winder. I've had one for years and have been very happy with it. My original Wonder Winder included the ""optional"" metal swivel bracket. Being able to turn this thing side to side makes all the difference in the world in both walking past it and in pointing it in the direction that I'm dragging the cord. I ordered my second one from Amazon because of its competitive price but am disappointed to find that it didn't include the swivel mount, especially since the image on the website appears to show the swivel bracket rather than the round plastic mounts. I HATE losing the swivel capability and any money I saved on my order will now be lost as I'll need to track down this ""optional"" feature from somewhere else."
1,"Nice concept, but cheap plastic and non functional","This is designed for a 25' light weight cord, but I can not even imagine a person lazy enough not to hand wind that.I bought it to wind and store 75' professional grade cords in my garage. The cheap plastic components could not lift the cord into the mesh basket.So this is for grocery store 25' electrical cables, but you have to drill the mounts into a solid wall with 2"" screws?!? Bizarre.Like I said, the concept is good, but made WAY too cheap to be functional."
1,displeased customer,Quick Winder RAP-100 Electric Cord and Fiber Optic Cable Reelproduct is made of inferior plastic.the first and olnly time i used it the cam and handle stripped. it is now useless.the only recourse i have is to write this review.at least i can vent my frustration on this computer.
1,Useless,"This is possibly the biggest piece of crap I've ever bought. I put it together, attached it to the wall and tried to wind a cord. The mechanism is so weak, it couldn't wind an inch of cord.The crank just spun with no cord being taken up. How this got 4 stars is beyond me. I should sue Worthless Wonder Winder for wasting my time and for postage. Drop this one Amazon."
1,red flag!,"this thing sucks really bad mounted it to the wall,had 100ft cord started winding the cord and the handle snaped this thing is made to wind ethernet or telephone cord it can't handle much more than that, not extension cord it's a really poor constructed product thin plastic good idea crap design spend more get more.:( grr!"
2,Dumb... Hubby wouldn't even put up,"Bought for hard-to-buy-for husband for a xmas gift. It's been sitting in the garage for 6 months with no chance of being installed. He thinks it's dumb and would have preferred a wind up kind of extension cord winder...oh wellUPDATE: Been a year. Recently found the still-in-box ""winder"" in the ""Goodwill"" pile and decided I'd try it myself. Must preface by saying, it was kinda cold out and the typical orange cord was a little stiff, but... that winder didn't even work for ME! The crank turned without any feeding of the cord into the net basket and I practically needed three hands to assist. I therefore, re-confirm my two star rating since it's POSSIBLE it'd work with a narrower, warmer cord, in the summer (however we use electric cords year-round so it's not good for us).(Commentors: thanks for the reminder to update my review)"
5,WONDERFUL Wonder Winder,I purchased this Wonder Winder after Christmas when I took my outside Christmas lights down and I absolutely love it. It was easy to install and super easy to use. My wife and I both use it and we love it. Any friend who buys their first home will receive a Wonder Winder from us as a house-warming gift.
2,Sensetive Spinner,"I shouldn't have had very high expectations for this product, in view of its low price. But after I went out and bought a 100' #12 cord, the cost became considerable. While working - wrestling - with the cord to try to get it fed into the winder, it became apparent the two were not compatible. Maybe someone, somewhere, has been successful in creating the combination but, after quite a while, I put my brand-new cord on a reel and installed an old #16 cord on the winder. The installation of a cord onto the winder requires carefully twisting and straightening the cord prior to cranking it in. Hence, no time saved at all. The unit does not grip the cord if there is the slightest resistance and if you happen to be in a damp environment it is necessary to completely wipe the cord dry before you have any chance of reeling it in. Good idea - needs design work."
3,Nice addition to garage,"Nice and handy addition to our garage for those occasional times we need an extension cord to power a vacuum or blower. However, crank is a bit cranky when trying to handle thick heavy duty cords."
4,GOOD PRODUCT,"It works good for my purposes. It does not take heavy cords, like a 12/3. A 16/3 it works very well. It sure beats twisted, kinked cords. I like it being able to move it to two different places. Like from my spare garage to the house garage. The best thing I have found yet."
3,Does not work as good as it looks..,"Neat idea and it looks great in the garage, but the slightest tension from a 100 ft. cord and it won't wind easily. You cannot work it one-handed (you must keep another hand on the lever). Think I will stick to the plastic circle cord storage - but if you have a short cord and can get this on sale, you might try it."
4,Cord holder,"Works as designed was bought for my dad he thinks it's better than sliced bread, I glad he's happy with it."
4,Functions well,"Just installed yesterday, I'm curious how long that plastic will hold up being subjected to cold and heat of garage. This unit functions very well, it rolls up the cord just as it should, and it comes out easily too. One thing to note is mine came with the plastic wall mount rather than metal. The plastic mount keeps the unit in a 90 degree angle with the wall. It may have been a packing error, because I got two plastic mounts in the box."
2,Terrible Audio Quality,"How hard can it be to make a decent audio tape of one man reading the Bible? The opposite side bleeds through and they often break between sides right in the middle (or worse, just before the end) of a verse. The 2 stars is just for Scourby's voice quality."
3,We need more of this!,Bravo CMH - this is what we need. Bluegrass instrumentals are quite rare these days and the best of them were done in the 1970's. CMH have delivered a fine package for the bluegrasser who prefers not to listen to a bluegrass voice which often detracts from the fine acoustic music. Let us be honest and say that many singers have B-Awful voices and instrumentals like this terrific collection are wonderful to locate. Thank you CMH.
2,Screw/No Screw,"I was wandering through the Amazon tool section and ran across this product. What a great idea! I put it into our Christmas wish list and my wife ordered it. I opened the present this morning. The punches look good. The rack that holds them is another story.The rack was twisted. One screw was loose, another had the nut laying in the bottom of the box. I took the punches out to fix the loose screws and discovered the rack had been twisted so far out of alignment that one of the punch holes had been torn.The final discovery was when I tried to put the loose nut onto its screw. It wouldn't stay so I decided to replace it. I pulled the screw out and discovered it wasn't threaded. Apparently whoever assembled the rack was more interested in getting it shipped then quality control.I'm sending it back for an exchange. Hopefully the next one has all the screws threaded."
5,Live From Atlanta,"This is an awesome album! Unlike the live album before it, it is mostly new tracks set in a live environment, with one new studio single, ""Helicopter."" It's a much needed addition to any Flickerstick collection!"
2,Sticky rolling pin,"I purchased this because it was on sale and it said ""nonstick"" which is very important when working with dough. However, all it does is stick! I didn't like it at all and even though it was cheap I'm thinking about returning it ...."
5,Great Job Jordan!!,"Jordan Pruitt did an EXCELLENT job on her debut album, No Ordinary Girl. The songs are great and they can relate to typical high school teenagers. Jordan has an amazing voice and she is definetly someone to watch. Also, if you love the CD, make sure you see her live. I have seen her on tour and she delivers a GREAT performanace!"
1,It STILL doesn't work.,"We've tried to like this product. The first one we ordered arrived broken. The body of the washer was split. It also had apparently been repackaged. We sent it back for an exchange. The second one arrived promptly and appeared to be in good shape. After assembling it, we discovered the GFI tripped on each attempt to turn it on. We tried it in several outlets and even took it to a neighbor's home which had had recent electrical work. It still did not work.Amazon.com is great on returns. That is the only plus concerning this product. While it may perform well once you get one that is workable, we give up. We returned it for a refund this time."
5,Karcher K360MPlus 1600 PSI Pressure Washer,I was going to dispose of 2 outdoor wood chairs and a table - they both look new after cleaning with the Karcher K360MPlus washer. This pressure washer is absolutely amazing in what it can clean. It even took old paint spatters off our drive way!
5,A Great Little Pressure Washer,"Okay, I'll admit it: I haven't used this device since we bought it. But my wife just raves about it! Here's what she says: ""I wanted a pressure washer to wash our concrete driveway, the patio deck, and the white clapboard siding that gets so dirty. And I didn't want to spend the earth. There are bigger models, more powerful, mostly gas-powered and costing about double the price of this washer. It's not a 'commercial' product, and it won't peel off old paint or 'sandblast' bricks. That's not what I wanted it for. It's great for household use and does a good job of washing our cars and windows. I mostly use just the one jet sprayer although it comes with other attachments. Overall, I'd say a dandy product for the price."""
5,A classic for all time!,"This was teddys first solo album(after he left harold melvin & the blue notes) when you play this cd you can tell that a lot of time and efford went into this project.Every song from you can,t hide to somebody told meis a gem.This was the first of four teddy albums in my opinon that teddy, gamble & huff and the philly sound came thru.Great vocals by teddy on this one it is a classic that stands the test of time enjoy!"
5,"A wonderful read, delightful parody","Henry Beard presents a collection of well known verse, written ostensibly as they would have been penned by the cats of famous authors.From Dylan Thomas' cat writing ""Do Not Go Gentle to That Damn Vet"", to Robert Louis Stevenson's Cat who writes:Squealing mousie in a trap,woke me from my morning nap,wasn't he so very sweet,to tell me it was time to eat?A must read for the well read poetry fan.Alan McClendon"
4,Very Cute,"This is a very cute book. If you're into poetry and cats and are familiar with the famous poets studied in your English 101 class, then you should get a few giggles out of this little collection. Makes a great gift for the cat lover."
2,Jared Leto can kiss my @$$,"So the guy is a good actor...he should STICK to acting. When I heard the guy had his own band I figured I'd check it out. Overall I was very dissapointed, not being able to find even one song I really liked on this cd. While it's not flat out horrible, it's pretty much a waste of money if you consider yourself a rock fan. Its kind of an Alt. Rock Industrial who knows what...which wouldn't be so bad if the songs had some hooks or the slightest hint of being catchy; but these songs are mostly all boring filler at best. If you like the samples then more power to ya but I definitely reccomend giving it a listen before you buy or you might be dissapointed."
5,30 Seconds To Bliss,"Regardless of your opinions of actors venturing into musicianship, you owe it to yourself to check this one out. 30 Seconds to Mars' debut album is simply too powerful to be ignored. ... There isn't a weak moment in the album. From the opening chords of ""Capricorn"", right down to the last seconds of ""Year Zero"", there isn't a dull moment. A beautiful guitar crescendo kicks in between ""End of the Beginning"" and ""Year Zero""...it lasts only a few seconds and serves as a segue, but even THAT is well crafted and important to the album. Buy it. Now."
1,A plot line only it's mother could love...,"I have enjoyed Suzanne Forster's books in the past, so I was thrilled to see this in the store. However, it's convoluted plot was so unbelievable that I had trouble turning the pages. The whole Mexico scenario was absurd. This book has made me place Ms. Forster's future novels on my ""checkout from the library"" list - rather than buying her products from the store. Save your money!"
3,"Wonderful performance on wonderful fortepianos, but poor engineering","Since I liked Bilson's concertos CD set very much, I expected a lot before this set arrived. The first listening disappointed me, not because of Bilson's performance, but because of Hungaroton's engineering mistake. This CD set sounds like playing Dolby encoded cassette tapes without decoding. Although Dolby B decoding-like equalization improves the sound quality, it is nicer if Hungaroton reissues the set with problem fixed. Bilson's performance is wonderful and I know Mc Nulty's fortepianos sound beautiful.Hungaroton made the same mistake on Annie Fischer's Beethoven sonata set."
1,Bummer...,"Heh, it's April 1, but this is no fools' joke. I ordered this over a year ago, received it, and was looking forward to finishing my Alan Parsons collection. This was the last one, and I needed it. When it arrived on-time, I was elated! But it was defective. It wouldn't play on any DVD player, and wouldn't work in my computer. Prompt replacement. Same thing. I gave up, and have been waiting for a re-release. Service was all good, experience was fine, but the discs were simply manufactured wrong. Just wanted to warn the would-be buyers to watch out."
3,Mixed Feelings,"Have you ever had that feeling when you try to like something so much and you try and try and in the end you feel disappointed? That's exactly what happened to me with ""The Second Assassin"".I love II World War fiction, after reading the previews for this book I was sold. The book has a great sense of people and places, you are transported ""there"", there is no question that Hyde's research is top notch, the attention to detail is unbelievable. But the plot moves to slow, it fails to engage the reader, you find yourself reading to finish the book rather than because you are enjoying it.Summarizing, an OK book that could have been much better."
3,Weird sound called techno,"They say this is the first `techno' album ever... who knows.It sounds really weird even now, and it was made in the seventies.Personally my favourite is `The Model'... it's almost... commercial...They say these guys used to compose the same number of notes everyday...It's interesting. `Spacelab' is a cute and nice song.If you listen to this you will feel catatonic-elektronik-psykodelik-grooveytronik-...This is the stone age of techno."
5,The People's New Testament Commentary,The other other is Fred Craddock. These two teachers are among the best and I have used others of their many books. This one is simple enough for the non-specialist without being insulting to those who specialize in Biblical studies. I found it at a very opportune moment when I needed an additional commentary for some work I happened to be doing.
5,Great Commentary,"I have many commentaries for my seminary classes and sermon preparation, this is the one I use the most and the one that reflects my reformed Presbyterian views the best, great commentary."
4,An exellent read if you leave your preconceived notions at the door,"This book is about some very odd characters, but when you get to know them, you realize they are dealing with the same things ""normal"" people deal with: betrayl, lost love, heartache, hope.I did find the names of two of the female characters hard to cope with at first because they were so similar, but you'll get over it.I like that this author didn't feel the need to spell out every single thing that was happening in the story. You have to use your imagination, use deduction, and often times be patient to really understand what's happening. If you want to be spoon-fed, this might not be for you.Overall, this was an excellent read. If you are tired of the same predictable stuff and would like to be suprised, this is a great story to get lost in."
2,TOO STRANGE FOR ME-DIDN'T GET IT,This book was too strange for me. I quit reading it after about the third chapter. It seemed to me like she was trying to keep us in suspense but she didn't write anything interesting enough to keep me wanting to finish the book in order to find out what it was.Maybe it was just me???
5,Great Book!! I would HIGHLY recommend it!,"This book is one of the best devotional books I have ever read! My 7 1/2 yr old daughter LOVES it and begs me to read more than one devotion to her all the time. The stories are so true to life, the questions are great and the multiple choice answers are so realistic that I am sometimes glad there are answers! ha! The scriptures she uses are from the whole Bible and she doesn't just refer to the commonly used ones. For exampel, she sends kids to 2 Chronicles to read how the Levites were faithful or other books to lesser known stories. I cannot say enough about this book! Great job!!"
5,Great Devotional for the kids,We wanted to do daily devotions with our kids and this one is great. We have been using this devotional every day at dinner and the kids can relate to the situations. You won't be sorry buying this devotional.
2,Ick! Horrible!,"After getting thoroughly psyched on the sound of DTS 5.1 sound from the likes of Paul McCartney, Alan Parsons, Eagles, and David Benoit; along come the Moody Blues. One would have hoped that it would be a new experience.Unfortunately, while it might sound ""interesting"", I now find myself turning off the DTS surround effect while I listen to this cd. The use (or rather, the lack of) of the five channels available on this cd is a huge disappointment.If you're a Moody Blues fan, then you might want to check it out. Otherwise, this music did not transfer well to DTS and for awesome DTS sound there are better choices available."
4,How interested in haute-couture are you?,"The reviewer who said ""not for the faint hearted"" was understating. High fashion details, starting with the truly bizarre jacket on the cover, are probably not for the majority of us. The photos are an interesting history of fashion but I don't know how much of the interesting touches and admittedly time-consuming processes would find their way into anything I sew. I don't necessarily want my clothes to last forever and end up in the Smithsonian, so I would not recommend this unless you are really, really into detailed, multi-process construction work."
3,Nothing new,"This is book is OK if this is your first book on hand sewing techniques, and you already know how to construct clothing. However, the instructions when provided are better explained and diagrammed in the Vogue Sewing book - 1982 edition complete with color pics. The new edition of Couture Sewing does have lovely photos of some older couture clothes that illustrate a point of design or sewing but the instructions are not extensive enough for a novice, and too basic for someone with experience - I would look for a different how-to book if that's what you need."
3,Dated,"This book totally looks like it was published in 1994, which it was. Some of the information is useful but for the most part I find it really pointless unless I want to recreate some of the 90's old lady garments available at any thrift store for $4. I was a bit leery of the word ""couture"" being in the title but I was hoping for some timeless finishing techniques that would look really great. Instead I got a book that focuses on some ridiculous 90's lace cut outs. There are many better (current) books out there."
2,Poor for having been made in 1984,"For being a Metzger movie I expected a lot more! In the 70's he was a ""pioneer"" in erotic cinema, I thought that in the 80's he would go further, WRONG! The story is good and very original, but there is just not enough sex appeal throughout the movie, the few scenes are very ""unerotic"" and for being the 80's could have definately been more ""daring""!"
4,Works As Advertised,"This product works as advertised. It collects the vast majority of the dust generated by drywall sanding. Plastic parts are too breakable. That said, for under $50, this is worth every penny and then some. If I floated sheetrock professionally, I'd get something better able to stand up to use/abuse. For the ""sweat equity"" laborer, it's a gem."
3,OK for small remodel jobs,"I bought this for a small remodel in my house. I wanted to avoid always putting up plastic walls. This unit is pretty good at picking up 95% of the dust from sanding the sheetrock joints and it keeps the dust from clogging the filters in my shop vac. Now the negatives: The small diameter corrugated tube creates a high pitch squeal--you definately need to wear hearing protection when using this. Also, the sanding block ""sticks"" to the sheet rock because of the vacuum created by the holes on the flat surface--making sanding more labor intensive (I solved this by buying a sanding block (at my local hardware store) that could also be attached to a vacuum hose that had grooves running to the edge. I would recommend this for small remodel jobs only. I would not use it for a job involving more than 10 sheets of rock--too time consuming."
5,Superb drywall sanding system,"This sanding system acts like a water pipe, where a shopvac creates a vacuum in a bucket half filled with water. A hose to the bucket is connected to a hand sander, and the dust is sucked through the hose and trapped in the water.Simple, 95% efficient, and priced right! I bought two more after my first one finally broke from years of use. Since I use the system extensively in my contracting business, where I work in people's homes, I've got to keep from making a mess. Because I recognize this sanding system as being one of my most important tools, I bought a spare so that I would not be without one. About six months ago, things shifted in my van when I had to suddenly stop, and the hose connection on the lid got crushed. So I found I had to wait for a replacement lid to be shipped to me... But the company quickly shipped a new lid at no charge! Now, that is true customer service!!!"
1,Where can I get the rest.,"Where can I get the long pole sander to go with this item -- you only solved part of the problem with the hand sander -- I need to work on the ceilings, too."
2,Overrated,"I bought this book on recommendations and I was disappointed. Maybe its better for boys, but my child was not interested in reading it after the first few days. She viewed it as just another sesame street book."
3,"Quaint, mildly funny","Since the story has been summarized by others many times, there is no point in repeating it.It's a quaint, mildly funny story and an easy read.Except the nice English language -there is nothing to this short novel."
2,Recommended for those with long stays in Paris,"I was frustrated with this book's organization. I wanted to know things like which restaurant had the best chocolate mousse in Paris, which were the best values for the money, etc. With only one weekend in Paris, this book was too detailed for me and too difficult to quickly navigate."
5,Don't leave for Paris without it!,"My husband and I left for Paris with the usual Zagat's and Michelin's . . . a friend had given us Ms. Well's _Food Lover's Guide_ . . . I argued for taking it; my husband thought it too big and heavy. Since I was the person who had read it cover to cover twice, I won. After three days, we left Zags and Michs on the shelf in the closet, and consulted Ms. Wells constantly. It helped at every moment, from the first baguette in the morning, til the last cafe at night--and certianly in between, distinguishing between all of the wonderful food, kitchen, and food/gift shops. We will not go back to Paris without it.In fact, we will likely read it all year, savoring our memories, and getting ready for next years' trip!"
5,Inspring Story and Practical Advice,"Joan Schreiner provides an inspiring story of surviving against the odds as well as practical, down-to-earth advice for those struggling with a cancer diagnosis. I would highly recommend it for patients and their caregivers, family and friends."
4,Just a few minor annoyances,"This has everything a CD player should have, minus 1 or 2, plus it plays MP3s and WMA. Get 200+ songs onto a CD and enjoy for several hours. I only have 2 complaints about it. It doesn't come with resume and playlists can't be saved. Every time you make a playlist, if you stop playing it, it's gone. Also, you always start at the first track on a CD instead of being able to resume where you left off like most others. Other than that it's great."
3,not a very good unit,"this unit works and plays mp3, but here are the problems1. the anti skip is very bad. you can not even walk with this unit!2. It only reads one directory down. so if you have songs 2 directories down from the main you can not choose them. though the unit will play them in order. you just can't go to them manually."
5,"Great Product for The Money, Does everything i'd like it to.","This is an excellent MP3/CD Combo Player. It does what I need it to. Never skips, and the portable remote is great. It includes updateable firmware and an AC adapter (the SP90 doesn't) so it makes it well worth it. Note: I'm really only using this for the most basic features, I don't move around with it, nor do I use any of the advanced programmable features or equalizer...."
4,"It works, though it's cheap","It's not the most sturdy of items, and it definitely feels a little on the cheap side, but it WORKS. The power is a little low to the headphones but the quality is great. This totally saved my butt on an 11-hour flight to Tokyo recently..."
5,best player i have ever used,This player is truly amazing. The new firmware adds great features and increases performance. I love the large backlit screen and the sleek look of it.worth every penny.also - be sure to get the latest firmware if you buy this.
5,Very good player,"I was really surprised by this player. I thought I won't read some CDRs (as normal readers do, some have problems with the blue ones, some don't), I thought it will skip - nothing like it! It reads all the CDRs I burned long time ago, I can't ever read some of them on a normal CD-ROM anymore, but Rio can play them very well. CDRW's also. It does a smart thing - Rio reads the track ahead to a memory and the disc doesn't have to spin all the time. Very good idea to prevent from skipping, saves battery power as well. The navigation is very easy, especially if you put albums into separate folders. The tape player in my car is malfunctioning, I thought about replacing it, but Rio with a cassette adapter (not supplied! the only complaint!) sounds fantastic! I would have to spend quite a lot of money to buy a car system with this kick!"
3,Almost there...,"Up until now, mp3-cd players have been lacking one very important thing... good ID3 tag support. What good is a few hundred songs if you can't browse and choose a song title you want? I sure as hell don't want to sit and memorize all of the songs I have on a CD. Aside from this little feature, the sound is of average quality. Nothing to do backflips over, but it is okay. The biggest problem is the CD not playing when the player is turned sideways. I always put my CD player in my pocket on the go, but this player will skip when you do this. That is what is preventing me from buying this, and this is also why I think the price is so low. This is close to an ideal player, but not quite yet. Improvements need to be made on the hardware. Until that happens, I am keeping my money until a player comes out that is worth my money."
3,Wouldn't work in the car,I got this for my car after my Phillips started stalling out on me. But this one wouldn't work with the 4.5V car power adapter from that player or another adapter I bought for it. I don't understand because it DID work with the AC adapter which (obviously) uses the same jack. They should have charged me a couple more bucks and included (and thereby included in the warranty) a car kit that was designed for the unit. I didn't want to fuss with it anymore so I just returned it. I would gladly pay [price]for a good reliable portable mp3 cd player. When will I find one?
5,A Book With No Heroes,I also felt sad for the people when I finished the book. Is there any character to look up to? No. Did any of the characters grow to become better people? No. Is this a typical community of families in the 60's? I don't know. Can you take much from this book and reflect on your own life? Absolutely. The book held my rapt interest throughout. Not your typical fiction. Highly recommended.
4,Informational.,"I got this for college as required material. The class didn't use it much, but I use it as a reference guide and have found it to be very useful throughout my schooling."
1,"R-E-P-E-T-I-T-I-O-U-S- repetitive, TO SAY THE LEAST","Dang near every story ran the same course, which was, the ""client"" turns out to be the ""killer"". Every singlestory was predictable. I found none of them to be original or special.Mr. Block, along the line of Elmore Leonard, has a gift for dialoge but his stories are dull and repetitious.And the book itself was so bloody heavy it was a pain to comfortably read."
5,Lawrence Block,"This is a great writer who has a variety of characters that as was the case here, jump right off of the page in into your imagination. It's hard to put down and harder to finish (because then there's no more to enjoy)."
3,"Good quality, poor design","I was disappointed with this purse. The leather is very soft and the detailing is nice, but the design is not very practical. It is quite roomy and has two compartments as well as credit card slots, but there is no zip containing these two compartments. There is a zipped pocket inside the purse, but the rest is only contained by the buckled strap. It seems silly to boast of an extra large wrist strap to carry the purse when you can only keep the contents inside the purse by carrying it upright as a clutch. Also, the platinum version is not bright and metallic as shown in the picture; it's more of stone color."
5,Great,"I think this book was a really great book for people like me,I'm planning on reading the rest of this amazing book series"
4,My least favorite of the Potter books,The thing is that the worst Potter is better than anything else anybody else is writing. I think what hurts this one is the dark story of the chamber of secrets clashes with her need to keep this one kiddy. Still characters and setting are so good it overcomes any shortcomings.
5,A charming follow-up,"I greatly enjoyed Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. This book wasn't incredible, but no one should have ever expected it to be. The story of Harry Potter builds as he grows more mature, therefore allowing greater depth in late books. The character development is what is exciting about the Harry Potter series, each character grows and changes from book to book. If you are not anti-mainstream and have not yet read a Harry Potter book, I strongly suggest you try reading the first two."
2,"Good for 4th graders, but no more.","This book, along with all the other harry potter books, sucks for anyone over the age of 10. And as for that 30 year-old guy from cold springs, NY, he needs to read more complicated, and mature books. Redwall is much better, so is any book by j.r.r tolkien. If your under 10 you should be reading this book, if your over 10, you should be ashamed, and of given this book to your little sisiter or brother by now."
5,Harry Potter,"This book was sooooo great! A lot of my friends like the book too! It's not just for little kinds, we're all in high school. Plus, my mom really likes the book. If you haven't read the book, you really should. There's just something about it that is so appealing. I highly recommend it!"
4,I was overly suprised!,"I read this book, expecting to be dissapointed. You see, sequel are hardly ever better than the original book. I actually liked this one alot better than the first. It had a little more plot depth and seemed to fit better.Anyone who reads decent literature needs to at least read this book. It is an outstanding book!"
5,Totally Teriffic,"Harry Potter is sinsational!!! He is an average kid, a good friend, and an average student. There is just one difference between him and you and me. He is a wizard. He can fly on a bloomstick and do spells! While going to school at Hogwarts he discovers a hidden chamber. Will he be able to save the day? Read and find out."
5,Great book,I thought the book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was a great book. I liked how it was a mystery in a way that you did not know who open the Chamber of Screats. I would recomend this book to any one.
5,Kids preferred Harry Potter over NINTENDO!,"Harry Potter is visually very appealing. Fast paced and witty, kids just won't put it down. The character of Harry is a little flat, however he still engages the reader's sympathy. Highly recommend, particularly the UK or Canadian versions which reflect the author's original intent."
4,"OK, but not the best","When I read this book for the first time, I thought it was great. And the second time. But by the third time, it'd palled a little. The thing is, books 3 and 4 have so many revelations about various people's pasts, presents and futures that you can read and reread them loads of times, but book 2 doesn't have half as many. Also it doesn't have many new characters - Lockhart is ok but he gets tiresome, and the others - Ginny, Aragog, Tom Riddle etc - just don't have as much depth and interest as those in the next 2 books, Sirius and Moody, for instance. It's still a good book, with some clever twists, but the best is yet to come..."
2,"FUN Read, but only that.","I admit, the Harry Potter books are a fun read, but I found that they got boring halfway into this book. It lacked depth! The formula plot is as always: amazing boy escapes evil, tries to figure out evil, evil isn't what he thinks it is, always finds a way to beat it. You could always tell what was going to happen. There was something definetly lacking. There's many better fantasy books and authors out there, among them DAVID EDDINGS, C.S. LEWIS, BRIAN JACQUES, TERRY BROOKS.DON'T GET CAUGHT UP IN THE HYPE!"
3,The review of Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets.,"This review is about Harry and his friends going on another great adventure.Harry is yet again back at his Aunt and Uncle's house and things aren't looking too good for him. His Uncle is having a very big night and Harry has to stay in his room to find a little strange House Elf called Dobby. Dobby tries to persuade young Harry not to go but Harry is having none of it.Harry had a little mis-hap with his Uncle and is now barracaded in his own room. Lckily Ron his bestfriend saves him by flying a flying car. Harry then lived with Ron and his family till the rest of the summer.Harry and Ron reach the train station to find that the gateway to the train is blocked. They take the flying car to catch up with the train but find themselves at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.You will have to find out the rest, when you read the book yourselves!!!!!!!!"
3,More honesty please,I bought these used but the seller said they were in good condition. I guess they pretty much are but not were rewound and seem to be dangerous in the rewind department. It would have been nice to be told this so I could choose not to buy them.
4,Christmas Present,My granddaughter has not received it yet. It is a Christmas present. But she loves the last two I bought her. She has a condition that is causing her eyesight to diminish until she will eventually go blind. She loves the Harry Potter movies.
1,yawn,"i kinda feel akward writing this review, since im the only known person to hate harry potter books, well besides those super religious people against witchcraft. Anyway, I honestly didnt read all of it, but enough where i can say YAWN. i was reading it, and was really getting into it, but it seemed to go on and on, and by the time i got to the chapter that said ""The Chamber of Secrets"" and closed the book. It took me so long to actually get there, by the time i reached it i didnt even care any more. Im not bad mouthing the book or anything, go ahead and buy it, im not stopping you, most people like it. I just think its sad kids waste weeks and weeks reading every single one of these books. Its as thick as a dictionary for God's sake! I'd rather wait for the movie."
3,A So-So Read,"First off, I loved the first book!! I realize that it would be hard to duplicate all the excitement that was served up in the Sorcerer's Stone, but I didn't really anticipate such a big drop off in the quality of the story. I still suggest that averyone that read the first book should indeed buy this one as there are so few quality books for children, but just don't expect the same feeling that the first book delivered.."
4,A Great Ending,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a great book. J.K. Rowling wrote this book with a lot of description and conotation. This book's writing doesn't only tell it shows so that it can be pictured in young peoples minds. The beginning of the book starts off slow, but gradually gets more exciting as it reaches the climax. From then on the book is really exciting. The ending is great because it is unexpected. This book is awesome."
2,I Don't see what the fuss is about.,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is certainly a quite a good book, but it isn't the best. Everyone is saying how wonderful Harry Potter is, but personally I've read better books. The plot is rather weak, and I think it's just a bad novel that happened to atract an audience. Good literature is hardly ever on the best seller list."
5,I recommend this book to anyone who likes magic and mystery.,"I just loved this book. I read the first book, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" and it was definitely a page-turner. I just finished the second book and I say it was blood curtling yet bound for sucess and excitment. I'm madly in love with and filled with admiration for the trio Hermione, Ron, and, of course, the famous Harry Potter. I've enjoyed reading about them so much that I'm waiting in deep anticipation for the 3rd book, which I've already ordered. I think J.K. Rowling is right up there next to Roald Dahl. I absolutely recommend this book to any one who likes magic, mystery, adventure and excitment. Enjoy!"
4,Cool Book,"You have to read the first bool to understand the first few chapters. I thought that the first 6 chapters were like a review of the first book. (This book I read for academic purposes, not for fun. But it is a fun book to read.) I have to come clean and say that this book has good vocabulary and very deatiled. This is a good book to read if you need points for Reading Counts!"
5,Best of the 7,"As a member of the Potter generation I was very much into all of the books and movies, reading/seeing them as soon as they came out. However the Chamber of Secrets has always been my favorite of the books. I have always thought of books 1-3 and books 5-7 as separate groups with book 4 connecting them. This said Book 2 foreshadows the Horcruxes and later events in the series but without the overly dark tone that is in 5-7 where these themes become more prominent. In Chamber Harry and Ron have to overcome the temporary loss of Hermione who is always the brains of the group, they overcome the suspicion that Harry is the villain, as well as dealing with a incompetent professor with an over-sized ego. There is a great bit of character development along with a suspenseful plot. So as I said, the best out of all 7 books."
5,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"This was one of the best books I have ever read. In my ninteen years of life I have never been much of a reader...until I picked up this book! I bought it as a Christmas present for my 9 year old brother....and I read the whole thing before he did. This book contained all the childhood fantasies I'd ever dreamed of. I loved it, and now I own the complete set of books 1, 2 and 3. I applaud J.K. Rowling for her wonderful imagination and for the descriptive ways she puts it into words! I will treasure Harry Potter always, and one day share it with my children!"
5,"As good as the first, but better","This book is another classic to add to the collection. This fast paced novel is more exciting then the first and some parts just down write creepy. Includind a magic diary the talks to you, a kidnapping, and a huge snake this book can be on the top of everyones lists."
5,Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets,"This book is about a kid named Harry Potter, he is 12 years old, and he is a wizard. Every year starting on September he goes to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. And he and all of the students are under the finest head master of all times ""Albus Dumbledor."" Harry goes back to hogwarts but when he gets there strange things start to happen to him and to his surrounding. Some people would stop and never move again under a spell and would be as cold as ice. Someone who the teachers think is the air of slytheryn has re-opened the Chamber of Secrets, and someone is righting with blood in corridors walls. But who is the air of slytheryn? What does it want or whom does it want? And why is he doing this?"
5,I loved this book along with the whole series.,"I read this book the minute it came out. It is so amazing. I loved how Riddle's journal came into play, and how it was a horcrux. There is never a sentence or word that is out of place, and every bit of this series is connected to each other. I can't wait for the 7th book which I already have pre-ordered off of Amazon.thank you for your time,Loran"
3,Not up to much I'm afraid,"After such a strong start with 'Philosopher's Stone' I was rather disappointed with this very weak entry. I've never read another book with such a straight-foward and plain mystery. I hope the rest of the series isn't going to be this way.A mystery novel should set up the clues in contradiction of each other. The pieces here go together so easily that it ruins any intrigue there could have been. And now that we know our way around Hogwarts and know all the characters and teachers their should be a lot more room for more mystery and new ideas. But that doesn't happen.It's rather weird that 'Chamber of Secrets' is longer than the first yet contains less mystery, imagination and invention. Even the final showdown is very basic and totally without spark. But if you liked the first then give it a shot."
5,The pride joy!!!,"The book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is one of J.K. Rowling's best books ,it is a 100 times better than Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.The book is so good because Harry Potter saves Ginny from Tom Riddle by stabbing Tom Riddle's book of dreams, and saving Ginny from turning to stone . Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an awesome book to read, and a good book to enjoy."
5,Captivating,"I pride myself in encouraging my children to read. I also like to know what they are reading. Thus I picked up their book of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets after reading the first. I must say these books are very well written and are so visually discriptive I can actually picture what the surroundings look like based by J.K. Rowlings words. Yes I have seen the movie and I am very proud of how well they kept to the book, mostly. I am now reading the fourth and plan on reading the whole series with my children."
4,A good childrens book!,"This is the second book of the Harry Potter series and I liked it a lot. The thing that I really enjoy is that JKR has made it so that the kids who started reading these books were about the same age as Harry. As time has gone on, it's almost like JKR has made the books older growing with not only Harry but with the kids reading them.This book is full of excitement, adventure, and childrens mischief. At parts it's like a comedy, others it's like a murder mystery, and still others it's like an action/adventure. JKR has added just enough of everything to keep her readers interested."
4,AWESOME BOOK,"I loved this book! However, I don't think it was as good as the first and it's a bit more confusing. Yet, the book still makes me roar for the sequal."
5,It is way better than the first book,Harry potter and the sorcerers stone was very good I liked it alot but the the second book is way better! ron and harmine are back in the second book along with rons little sister.If you liked the first book you will like the second.
5,One of my favorite books,Harry potter and the chamber of secrets is a great book for everyone! I like it a lot more than anyone other series of books
4,Makes you want to get into the car just to listen!,"Jim Dale's reading of ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is a pleasure to listen to. More than that, Dale's reading turns my normally fighting/whining/yelling boys into models of good behavior when in the car. Dale's voice is not the most beautiful in the world, and sometimes the way he lengthens words (as when, say, Ron or Hermione begins a sentence ""Harry"") gets to be too much for me, but his timing and phrasing are excellent. If anything, they add excitement to the book, something that I, until now only impatiently a listener, would have believed impossible. Although I hate to say it, the effect is downright magical. If you have to drive often with children in the car, you could scarcely go wrong with this."
5,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Good read, EASY read, funny in spots. I will be interested in reading the next in the series of seven.."
5,A Tom Swift series for the new Millenium,"Not since the Tom Swift series in the '60 (and possibly This Present Darkness earlier this decade) have I anticipated a sequel so much. And I agree, the second improves upon the first. Fortunately Rowling paints such vivid a picture in your mind that it shouldn't be easy to screwed it up in the translation to film (Warner Brothers I hear) if whoever directs/produces it is competent (or at least has my vision). I can imagine what it was like in the '50's waiting for the Lord of the Ring sequels to come out!"
5,An excellant book!,The book was excellant!I liked the book very much.My favorite part was when Harry battled Voldemort.
5,Harry's 2nd book is great!,"The sequel to ""Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone"" is just as transfixing and amazing as the first. Although it doesn't grab readers right in the beginning, after the first few chapters I was hooked. It had a great plot, characters, and end. Magical!"
3,Good book!,"I really enjoyed this book, the pace is good, the characters are well-developed, the subplots are fascinating and the book is suspenseful. Worth a look!"
4,Harry's second year at Hogwarts is even more eventful!,"The story begins at Harry's 12th birthday - he's home for the summer with the uncaring Dursleys. New characters are introduced, starting with Dobby, an elf-slave who reminds me an awful lot of Yoda and Jar-Jar Binks from the Star Wars movies.The book is every bit as engrossing as the first one, though much darker with more frightening events - spells cast on children; giant spiders and serpents; a violent Quidditch match and a bit of bloodshed. It made me wonder if younger children should be guided through the story. For adults and young adults, it is fine.I like how there is a bit of humor injected but it isn't as frequent as in the first book. The loyalty of Harry and his friends is admirable, however they do seem to disregard rules and distrust adults a lot and take matters into their own hands.Harry is destined for greatness, however, and I'm off to read book 3!"
2,The weakest link in the series.,"Though it has been 5 years since i have read it, the 2 installment is by far the weakest and least interesting book in the series. As rich and colorful the first was, the second seemed grey and boring. The series was given life by the 3rd, Prisoner of Azkaban, again...and there after with the rest. Just be ready is all. I even fell asleep in the movie, amusingly."
5,Harry Potter is back again and just as good!,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secerets is a great story. Usually, sequels are really boring, but that definately is not true about this book. I can't believe how much trouble Harry gets into this time. I don't think I can make it long enough until the next book in the series comes out. I just wish J.K. Rowling could keep writing about Harry Potter forever! I think I have Harry Potter fever!"
4,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.,"While this is my least favorite harry potter book, it is important to read it for the series. It does contain a lot of important information for the rest of the series.Many people do thoroughly enjoy this book in the series and for good reason. Like all of the Harry Potter books, it contains action, drama, and a touch of humor.I do recommend it to complete any Harry Potter Series."
3,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was too slow-paced,"When I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone I was totally drawn into the book. I couldn't set it down. New things were happening every second, and it kept me in suspence the whole time. However, when I eagerly started reading Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, I was disapointed that the book was nearly three-quarters over before it started getting into the action. The book takes too much time setting it up for the one moment of suspence, and I started yawning with all the description. I think this book could be skipped and you would not loose too much of the Harry Potter series. However, even though I did not like the Chambers of Secrets was good, I thought both the Sorcerers Stone and the Prisoner of Azkaban were fantastic, and I would definately recomend them."
2,frustrated,I had to send this item back because it was cassette not CD as the other set that I bought and there was not a cassette player in the car.
3,good book for light readers,The book was alright. I am not big on the magic stuff so i didn't really follow too much on the wierd words that make stuff float. the plot was good with plenty of leading turns which cause you to wonder and second guess all thatr you have concluded. the one good thing about this book is it really shows the true value of a good friendship and teamwork.
2,Where is the magic??,"Oh dear...where should I begin? To be honest, the 1st half of this book just isn't that exciting - if not boring - compare to the 1st book.I can only read so much about Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia's abuse to Harry - it's just not very intesting - I'm sorry.The 2nd half things begin to pick up, I only wish JKR wrote the 1st half more exciting..."
4,Excellent Sequel,"A lot of series have disappointing second books in the installment, but The Chamber of Secrets is definitely not disappointing.The book is so great for a second book. It sets up the series to continue so perfectly, while actually giving closure at the end--something few series books are able to accomplish well. At the end of the book I was eager for more, but satisfied at the same time.As far as the Harry Potter series is concerned, I think this book is right in the middle with the first book being only slightly better."
5,Great book,The second book I`'ve read on my kindle and its great can't wait to read the rest of the series
5,Harry Potter 2 book review,"Harry Potter 2 book review by Bobby MillerHarry potter 2 the chamber of secrets by J.K Rowling is a great read if you've just finished #1. Harry potter has just finished his first year at Hogwarts and now he's just got a few things on his mind, for example his friends haven't written him a single letter all summer, a small house elf is hiding in his room and once he gets to school people stars getting Petri... well maybe I should just let you read the book to find out what happens. Anyway, if you start this book it will drive you crazy until you've found out what happens."
4,The Most Humorous Of The Harry Potter Series,"Chamber of Secrets has to be the most humorous of the Harry Potter series. The character of Gilderoy Lockhart had me rolling. His gleaming smile, audacious personality and hidden intentions made for a gripping tension between him and many of the other favorites at Hogwarts. This second book also set the stage for what we would come to expect as the yearly return to the school of wizardry. Each time the journey would change (This time including a flying car), new faces color the crowds and active scenery (An unhappy willow tree) adds depth to this secret world within our own. In this case the book far surpassed the movie."
5,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secerts,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secerts was a fantantic book. It gives the reader what they want with a great plot and awesome ending. The book has a nice combination of a great story with the touch magical fiction. In the book Harry is a twelve year old boy who goes to school where they learn magic. But, there is something weird going on. Kids in the school are being attacked by some thing and they don't know what. It's up to Harry to save the day. I felt that this was interting and it kept you in suspense. I could not wait to turn the page. If your not sure you would like to read this book, I suggest you try it out to see for your self."
5,Katie's Review,"Have you ever thought about living with your aunt and uncle that terrorize you? Well, I have the story about a boy that is 12 uears old that lives with his mean old Aunt, his Uncle, and his fat cousin Dudley. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an extraordinary book with lots of adventures about Harry, his one teacer Gildery Lochart"
5,Can't Wait Till It Comes Out,"Rowling did so good with the last book (Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone), I'm certain this next book will be just as good. It's not out yet, but if you're skeptical about it, DON'T be! I can assure you that it is wonderful."
3,Harry Potter and the chamber of secerets,"I rated this book a three star, and the three reasons why i did is First, I thought the author had a good imagination, she made cars fly and a certain plant had a baby growing. Second, I thought she was very discriptive, she described certain things like the whomping willow tree that crushed a flying car and she described how the tree looked. Third, I thought it was interesting. At one part there was a dead cat hanging from a torch post. The age group i rated this book for was grade six or you could say eleven year olds, and interest would be witchcraft and wizardry. In sixth grade they kind of get into books that might be similar. And they might read discriptive books like this."
5,A brilliant and creative writer of children's fiction.,Rowling is definitely the most creative and whimsical writer of children's fiction since Lloyd Alexander and J.R.R. Tolkien. I reccomend her books for all ages. The plotting is excellent and the characters very believable and the humor is well-mixed. Hope there are many more adventures of Harry Potter to come.
5,It was great! I coudn't put it down!,At first I was laying at home bored and not knowing what to do because I had just finished the first Harry Potter book when I decided I would read the second book. The second I started reading it I didn't want to put it down I just needed to know what happened next. Harry Potter books are always full of excitment and adventure. I like the description that j.k. Rowling uses. I hope the third book will be as good as the first and second.
5,Terrific Sequel. Just as exciting as the first!,J.K. Rowling once again reaches into our imaginaton. I love how she keeps suspense in this story. This book is an exciting sequel. Generally most sequels are not as good as the first. Well this book is just as thrilling and exciting as ever. I recommend this to people who have the first book or for somebody who is just looking for adventure. Eeven though I read this before I read the Sorcerer's Stone J.K. Rowling gives a little insight on what's going on in the first 20 pages. If you loved the first and you're hungry for more this is a must have!
1,"OK, not Great","I think it was an OK book, definetly for kids though, I dont think it even ranks near Tolkien's work. It was written towards kids, not like alot of other fantasy novels, if you are looking for a good fantasy read for older people, dont pick this, read ""The Lord of the Rings"""
1,Read this about Harry Potter,I really was disapointed in the Harry Potter book! There was nothing realistic about this book. It was boring and not any fun to read. I don't believe in things like Muggles or flying cars and I am not interested in things like that either! I don't think that this is a kids book! It is hard to understand.Things like headless people and spells is something all parents try to lead thier kids away from! It is a very dumb book! I don't recommend this book to anyone.
1,TOOOOO LONG!,"I read a portion of the book. It took SO Long! I finally got to the chapter, ""The Chamber Of Secrets"", and STOPPED READING! i couldn't stand the book any longer. It was taking so long to get to that chapter, that i didn't even CARE ANYMORE! I suggest seeing the movie, instead of wasting your life reading. I wish the books never came out, but the movies did. My brother loves all the harry potter books, but i hate them. Each time one comes out, he buys it, and spend more than a week in his room JUST READING IT! HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE! Just watch the movie. I don't plan on finishing this book, or for that matter, ever reading a whole harry potter book the rest of my life. Don't waste your money, save it for the movie.-Rita"
4,"Good, but not perfect","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is good, but not as good as the Sorcerer's Stone. The beginning and end are very attractive, but in the middle, the story gets kind of old. But overall, the Harry Potter series are one of the most entertaining books to read."
5,Good,Harry potter books have always been good.. I wish there was all these things in the movies but there never is in movies oh well great book
3,Ageless,I thought going to reading this that it won't be as good as when it first came out in print! I was gladly mistaken. The Harry Potter books are still a good read and seam to be one of those books that people will be talking about 20+ years from now!
1,Don't waste your money!,"I needed a stylus for my Kindle Fire, thought this would be great. Perfect color to match the ""skin"" I chose to adorn my new toy. I used it collectively a matter of minutes and it fell apart! I could not but it back together! As always AMAZON.com was very gracious excepted my return and issued my refund expeditiously. Thanks Amazon!"
5,Christmas gift,"I ordered this for my mother, I hope she likes it. She is a very big fan of Luis Miguel for more than 30 years more or less. I recommend to everyone."
4,sandy,I love this gorgeous man's music but can somebody tell me where to find the song i want most and can't find its called echame me la culpa i have looked for it everywhere but no one knows where to get it please somebody help. thanks SANDY
5,Fine Spanish Recipes,"My family of origin is spanish. I remembergoing to Grandmom's house and having someof the most delightful foods for dinner.Pork Roast, black bean soup, garbonzo beansoup, rice pudding...were all very yummy. Unfortunately,my grandmom passed away before I could get any ofher recipes. My aunt gave me ""Clarita's Cocina""last year. The recipes are authentic. The dishes Ihave made from them are almost like grandmom's. (NOBODYcooked like my grandmom.) The introductions to eachsection are fun to read. I am giving this bookto my grown children for Christmas and would highlyrecommend this cookbook to others who love traditionalspanish dishes."
3,Too much hype,"I would have enjoyed this book more if it had not been for the misleading quotes from other authors on the book jacket. It is an enjoyable read, but does not have the humor or ""quirkyness"" of a Stephanie Plum adventure. I was expecting something different - laugh out loud humor, quiet giggles...this book does not have them. Please! Stop comparing apples to oranges and let readers find their own enjoyment!"
5,"Nancy Bush - new to me, but more of her books on my kindle shelf!","Excellent mystery. She kept you guessing til the end. Have just discovered this author, and i love her! Reading Electric Blue right now."
4,A New Hobby,"Jane Kelly is a likeable character. She takes up a new hobby --Private Investigator which takes her on a wild ride.Binky, a dog left to her by a distant relative proves to be a welcome addition and saves the day in the end.She manages to cope with a crime and will become your favorite sleuth without getting completely stressed out.This ia an amusing book and I would reccomend it to those who like a good mystery and light reading."
5,Are You My Mother?,"In this highly descriptive and compelling memoir, Paula McLain shares with us her unstable, inconsistent, yet memorable childhood as a foster child growing up with her two sisters. She also shares her heartbreaking disappointments and adult perspective. I breathed a sigh of relief when I finished the book, knowing that Paula and her sisters reached adulthood and made better lives for themselves than their biological parents."
5,"Worked Perfect, PC Recognized Card Instantly",I installed the card and crossed my fingers hoping for the best. My computer is a few years old but has Windows XP. The Old Dell instantly recognized the new Belkin USB 2.0 Hi-Speed 3-Port ( 2 external & 1 internal ports) PCI Card. My new Canon Pixma 780 printer plugged right into the port and started working at wonderfully fast speeds. It makes a big difference and I was impressed that Belkin got it right and my old Dell Desktop instantly recognized the card and took care of the installation.I would hope everybody has the same luck I had with the installaton of this fine product.
3,IN ALL THOSE OLD FAMILIAR PLACES,"Mistress of suspense Mary Higgins Clark churned out another of her well-crafted if somewhat predictable and implausible thrillers with I'LL BE SEEING YOU. Reporter Meghan Collins is stunned while covering a hospital incident when a dying victim brought in is her identical double! In trying to identify this mysterious doppelganger, Meghan investigates an in vitro fertilization clinic and tries to piece together the events surrounding the mysterious death/disappearance of her father. Clark's narrative is terse and she's reminiscent of James Patterson in her choppy style. I'LL BE SEEING YOU will set no standards for suspense literature, but it's professional work from a smart and prolific novelist."
5,Author's View,"This book may be depressing to some readers, still, living and dying from AIDS can be depressing. It was not my intent to upset any reader. I strive to be real and that's my whole point in writing."
3,Depressing,"Life Can Definetly Kick Your Ass: Here Comes AIDS and HIV, by Victoria Warren. It was good book, but kind of depressing, especially after having a brother die of AIDS. I could definetly relate to the character, Shanna and how she felt about her sister Desiree having HIV/AIDS. You feel helpless and hopeless. There's nothing that you can do about the situation but try to comfort and be there for the person that's infected with it. I think that women need to be extremely careful and cautious when it comes to dealing with men and sex, that holds the same for men as well when dealing with women; even though the book is fiction, the story that it's telling happens everyday, someone is infected with and dying from AIDS/HIV.The only thing that I didn't like about the writing is that the author tended to give every detail about every movement that the character made. That got on my nerves.Sharon--Sophisticated Souls of Learning Book club"
5,love it,I have been looking for this movie forever. I am thankful for the seller and that I am able to get things that I never thought I would find it.
3,Finally. something she can be proud of.,"Hilary is not a great singer. she's okay. her songs in the past have been either passable or mediocore. Finally she has created something while flawed, that she will not be ashamed she created several years from now. Several of the songs i don't listen to. However the ones that i do like are really freakin good. ""Outside of you"" is so catchy and awesome that i basically discoverd this track and forgot about the rest of the album for about a week. ""Diginty"" has some great burns and a great beat/melody. ""With love"" and ""Stranger"" ""Danger"" and ""Gypsy Woman"" all really great songs and the only ones that i ever still listen to. I love all the sounds she includes though the melodys start to dissapear and the rest of the songs are hard to tell apart. great new direction for a singer who never really had a song to justify her record contract."
2,2-1/2 stars -- Would you believe this is her best album?,"I always said that Hilary Duff was another one of those celebrities that should just stick to making movies, a notion that was further confirmed after hearing her first two albums. And after the ""greatest hits"" album Most Wanted (contract fulfillment, perhaps?), she comes back at us with Dignity.Basically, I can see where Parkin is coming from when s/he suggested that a lot of these songs sound like they didn't make Madonna's Confessions on a Dance Floor. Many of the songs go by without being too memorable, like ""No Work, All Play"", ""Never Stop"" and the overrated ""With Love"". There are also some songs that could stand a rewrite or two, like ""Between You and Me"", ""Dreamer"" and especially ""Gypsy Woman"".Another flaw is that Hilary still isn't the greatest singer, but on songs like ""Happy"" and ""Burned"", she doesn't even sound like she's trying. While Dignity IS her best album, it's not that great, so you can do without it.Anthony Rupert"
4,Not bad at all,"ok i was embarresed to buy this cd, being in my late 30s but i put in the cd and was surprised, its actually pretty good, i even used a gift card thinking i would be dissapointed (and didnt want to be out any money)but i wasnt .she dosnt sound like a teenybopper but mature which was also a nice surpise also.her songs are catchy and you end up singing along.i recommend this cd and you can go out and buy it with pride.. its good!"
4,Duff does dance pop,"Hilary Duff, like her Disney predecessor Britney Spears, needs to grow up. So in an attempt to show the world how much she's grown up musically, this former TV actress and teen pop star delivers an enjoyable, albeit stilted dance pop album in the form of Dignity. There are some great songs here, most notably the Mideast-flavored opener (and single No. 2) ""Stranger,"" lead single ""With Love"" and ""Happy."" Still, that's not to say that there aren't cheesy moments--""Never Stop"" has a catchy enough riff, but it's still a bit, well, childish. Duff has never been that great of a vocalist, and her voice is still as girlish as ever, which makes it hard at times to believe that she is indeed as grown up as she makes out to be. However, with songs this good that really doesn't matter. There is a multitude of single-worthy dance pop material here and, like her or not, Hilary has stayed true to herself which, arguably, is quite dignified."
1,"Move on people, nothing to see here....","OK, so I don't actually own the album, but I did click through the samples and right out of the gate I heard drums. First rule of Bluegrass, you don't have a drum kit (which I doubt it was even a kit, I bet it was electronic). Go buy Ancient Tones by Ricky Skaggs if you want Bluegrass or Abby Road if you want Beatles and pass on this."
1,4 outlet junk,This is great if all of electrical devices you are connecting to it are lamps or some other device with a similarly narrow plug. This is supposed to be a 7 outlet surge protector yet the outlets are so cramped together that I can only use 4 outlets.
5,safety first,"i bought this because i want to keep my electronics safe, this surge protector is a little big but the position the outlets are in is genious you get to plug lots of stuff on it.i'm happy!!"
2,I'd like more info.,I'm very interested in the Mills line . Do you have other Books? I'd like to know more info. on the Mills in this book.
5,highly recommended guided tour of the C++ language,"""Essential C++"" conveys the essence of C++ in a very readable 200 pages. I was already familiar with much of the basic material but the review/reinforcement was helpful and I learned many new things about some relatively recent C++ features such as the standard template library, generic programming, function objects, templates and exceptions.This book takes a hands on approach, developing code fragments to illustrate the topics by example. It's very well organized with each chapter building on material from previous chapters. Lippman's writing is simple and straightforward with a touch of good humor.All in all a rarity - a technical book about computer programming that is well organized, full of useful information and fun to read."
3,Overall Good but a few typos,"I have found this book to be organized and very consise but there are a few typos in the book. I'm used to seeing errors in the technical books ( from C, C++, Perl ) but that's not good excuse. Please be aware of typos. If you want to really learn C++, get his other book ""C++ Primer"""
4,TAEKKYON DVD,"I think it is a fantastic DVD for learning Taekkyon. You may have to rewind the DVD a lot, but in the west we seem to have a need for constant written instructions and explanations on which way we should move or what stance we should use. Eastern martial arts is based more on learning through physical practice. You can't understand the true feeling of a martial art by reading a critical manual, you need to get physically involved (granted, written theory is also important). It will be difficult at first, but over a long time of practice, you will get used to the speed of the DVD, all it takes is practice. It's not the same as being taught by Grandmaster Lee Yong Bok in the flesh, but it's a start. I recommend this DVD to anyone who would like to learn or know more about Taekkyon."
4,Understanding our older loved ones,"I read this book by when my grandmother was living her last days in a nursing home. There was so much I didn't know about older people -- what is important to them, how they think, what their needs are, how they approach death. Simone de Beauvoir, the celebrated French thinker and writer offers an in-depth study of older people as individuals and older people in society. She also looks at the treatment and psychology of older people across time in western civilization. Anyone who is a caretaker of an older family member or friend, or cares about understanding older people will find this book remarkable and thoughtful."
2,What a pity.,"The book starts off wonderfully with Harris's visualization; you can see everything you read. There are complex characters introduced and of course a wicked weave between them. He shows the master insanity of Hannibal with his elaborate set-ups for escape from not only Starling but from a vile creature named Verger who sets out to seek revenge on the good doctor. And you are eating this up the whole time, because it seems that Harris is once again quite the masterful story teller. But then you get to the last few chapters.The best way I can describe it is it seems like he took his time and thought out every little detail like it was the master term paper. But then all of a sudden he realizes he doesn't have the time needed to finish it so he rushes it and throws an ending together. It was almost like to different authors. And of the ending! And what he does with Clarice! I was put off by the whole book in a matter of a few thousand words.James A. Forrest -Eye of the Storm"
4,A Well Crafted Tale,"I very much enjoyed this book. It was beautifully writen, with an engaging plot. Yes some parts of it are voilent but no more so than the previous two tales featuring Dr. Lechter.What is exceptional about this book is the variety of styles Harris makes use of. This book includes gothic, midevil, and trancesdental styles. By the end of the book I could not put it down.The reason I gave this book only four stars is I did find some inconsinetes regarding Dr. Lechter's charcter. In this book he commits murders he never would have commited in the previous book and he does so without explination. But on the whole it is well worth the read."
2,NOT HAPPY,After reading the excellent Silence Of the Lambs i found this a good book that should have ended 20 pages before it did. I was not happy at all with the way thomas Harris wrapped up this elegant thriller but hes a good writer and will rebound in the future i believe. Not worth reading unless your a diehard Harris fan.
2,Hannibal,"I was really dissapointed with this book. I read Silence of the lambs and expected the book Hannibal to be just as good or better. This book was so boring, it took me 2 months to finish it. The only creepy part in the book was with the detective. Hopefully if he ever writes another book about Hannibal it will be more interesting."
1,"One Star, Only Because None's Not an Option","Disappointing, beyond belief! I've liked all three of Harris' earlier books, including both with Lechter, and found them thoughtful, thrilling, and gritty. Better than ""genre fare."" But great thrillers need great villians, and the Lechter victim seeking revenge here is lamely underwritten, and foolishly cartoonish -- a hideous, disfigured, crippled meat packing czar who agents are secretly breeding the Terror Pigs of Europe as his instrument of vengeance. This is like something out of Danger Mouse or Inspector Gadget; James Belushi, not James Ellroy. Pathetic. The ending (interesting in principle) is so poorly developed and prepared that it turns preposterous, unconvincing, and arbitrary. Stephen King's review in the New York Times is inexplicable, except as a mutual back-scratching blurb bouquet."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"Hannibal was a let down after the excellent work of Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. It seems Harris was going through the motions and writing a movie screenplay rather than a novel. Although the details of the story are compelling, Hannibal lacks the wonderful prose, the deep psychological probing, and the detailed forensic science of Harris's previous works. The exception is the section set in Florence, which I thought was very good. Although Hannibal gives us some explanation for Dr. Lecter's psychosis, it was not the in-depth look I've been waiting for over the past 11 years. And I hated the ending--it was a complete betrayal of the character of Clarice Starling who started so promisingly as a rich and interesting female lead in Silence of the Lambs."
5,Awesome,"Found it hard to put this one down. Character development throughout the book is masterful. If you liked ""Silence"", read the book..."
5,"An unpopular view, but I loved it.","Don't dismiss this great book on the basis of the ill-adapted movie. The movie stunk - BIG time - but please don't let that put you off, as the book was AMAZING. The last chapter (to date) in the Hannibal Lecter story included some very gruesome people & events - perhaps overly gruesome - but the sleek Dr. Lecter is still a blast to tag along with - as he glides noiselessly through cool marble halls to reinvent himself, and evade the long arm of the law that shadows him. Just lovely!"
2,Not Harris' Best,I can't believe it took almost ten years for Harris to write this sequel to Silence Of The Lambs! Not worth the wait! Red Dragon and Silence were far and away much better reads. One can only hope Mr. Harris'next novel (rumored to be another Hannibal novel)is as spine-tinglingly terrifying as he is capable of!
1,Thomas Harris meets Anne Rice... results farcical at best,Don't be bothered. This 'book' is horrible. The story has all the charisma of an extended descriptive paragraph of Italy coupled with the warmth of a French gourmet-cooking guide. Stay away. (Or you get the hose.) You've been warned
4,"""Hannibal"" - Flip Surrealism Served-Up On Good China","""Hannibal"" may be one of the most exotic page turners I've come across. A one-eyed monster, man-eating pigs, hypnosis drugs, female body builders, a little Dante, lots of ugly cuts, bruises, and bites, a hungry pet eel, some evil Washington bureaucrats, and perhaps the strangest dinner party ever held make this one wicked brew of book. Hannibal may be a human cuisinart - but he also knows the sublime art of how to heal a soul. This book isn't simply about evil, but about the strange, uncanny intimacy between good and evil. What extraordinary places this book goes! You'll push your own envelope with this one!"
1,Disappointing,I could not wait for this book to be published! I wrote the date on my calendar so I could pick it up the day it was released. What a disappointment it turned out to be. The ending was so ridiculous that I just skimmed the last few pages. I would definitely recommend waiting until the paperback comes out or borrowing it from the library. I didn't even offer it to any friends to read.
1,You'll be disappointed.,"I know you don't want to hear it, but unfortunately it's true. This book is terrible! How can it be that a writer as talented as Harris has produced this? Unbelievably bad. A huge, huge, disappointment and a giant missed opportunity for Harris. If you have fond memories of Starling & Hannibal, do not taint them by reading this rubbish; keep your memories of the characters as they currently stand. Spend your time & money elsewhere."
2,"Lots of sizzle, but no steak","If a writer takes 10 years to create a novel, I would expect a bit more plot. Harris is long on details of Lecter's tastes, and excrutiatingly hammers home Lecter's genuis. Enough already; we get it. The plot was thin, but the ending was so disturbing, confusing and frankly a literary betrayal. It was ridiculously out of character for Starling and difficult to stomach. Rarely have I read something that left me feeling so angry at the end. Harris takes a character we have come to honor and respect and turns her into a monster's whore. What a lame excuse for an ending. I love Harris's earlier work and had been eagerly anticipating this book. What a sad thing it is. Maybe the movie will be a bit less disappointing."
3,Hannibal: Mediocre compared to Silence Of The Lambs,"Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector is back in part three of the trilogy. Hannibal couldnt live up to Silence of the Lambs, though.Dont get me wrong, it was good. But Thomas Harris couldn't recapture the magic he had in Silence of The Lambs or the Red Dragon"
2,intrigued until the disappointing end,"I could not believe such an ingeniously intelligent writer such a Thomas Harris could sell out his integrity like this. Red Dragon gave me nightmares and in my opinion is still one of the best horror stories I have ever read. Selling out at the end is a sacrilege, to the characters, the reader and last of all to Thomas Harris. I will admit that it is a good read until the last 2 chapters. If you just want to read another Thomas Harris book this will do, but if you are an avid fan as I was this book will disapoint you."
2,Not a masterpiece!,This book lacks alot of the elements that made the other books a masterpiece. I would not recommend this book to others.
4,A great sequel filled with a shocking ending.,"Hannibal; was a great reading experience. Harris has made a mind bending sequal to ""silence of the lambs"". It was a page turner from page one with an ending that will shock all who reads."
1,I can't believe this made it to print,"Hannibal Lecter as a well-funded Narcissus wandering through life admiring beauty? What? The few original ideas that show up in this book are quickly invalidated by rampant absurdity, and the entire thing quickly degenerates into unconnected and awkward confusion. The ending is ridiculous - I was sure I would turn the page and find a 'Just Kidding, here's the real ending' in enormous bold print.Do not read this book. I read a bunch of these reviews while halfway through the book, and was skeptical of everyone that didn't like it. This book is truly bad."
3,Overall pleasing but disappointing ending,"While I generally enjoyed the book, I was disappointed in the ending. I can not believe that Starling would join Lecter as a cannibal. The dinner scene was particularly unbelievable, unless you believe that Starling was then insane (perhaps I missed this point?)."
1,The Real Horror of Hannibal,"What a dissapointment. I don't know what has gotten into Thomas Harris' mind, but this book is a disaster. I am not sure how, but I was able to pull through the shallowness of his arid writing and finish it after 4 long weeks of dreadful reading. If I haven't checked the covers, I would have never thought this was the same writer who wrote a classic ""The Red Dragon"" and one of the most supsensful novels of all time, ""The Silence of the Lambs."" Save your time, money, and eyes and don't bother with ""Hannibal."" It's a boring story, with a shallow plot, filled with one dimensional characters and their cliche monologs. As I thought of Thomas Harris as specialist at ""it,"" I waited for a page turning, and suprising climax. But once again, he failed at re-reaching the level of a master writing which has propelled his previous two novels to such heights this novel will not even come close to"
1,El Stinko!,"Of the many books I've read this summer, this is by far the worst-and I've read some bad ones!Harris basically strings together as many gross-out scenes as he can think of, capping it off with the worst, most improbable ending of any ""best seller"" that I have ever read. Trapped on a long flight to Thailand with this book was like listening to someone in the seat next to me dragging their fingernails across a chalkboard the entire way.If this were the first book of the trilogy, no one would care about parts two and three. Save your money. Wait for the movie and hope they change the ending."
3,I just finished - what a disappointing ending!,"OK.. The book was good - the detail was incredible, but the plot was weak, at best. It was a page turner & it did make me queazy, and it did make me root for Lechter to get away from his own villian. But, I had always given Harris credit for creating a truely strong, brilliant female lead character -whoops!! What happened to that. And as far as plot development, I think he needs to go back and read Red Dragon and remember what it's all about."
4,A Thrilling read with a very dissappointing ending.,"I agree with many of the other reviewers about the ending. I've read Harris' other two books about Dr. Lector and looked forward to this one. I enjoyed the background on Hannibal and Harris' writing is top notch. Clarice's career and the infighting at FBI rings true. Crawford, however is just a cardboard image of his former self. I found it fascinating right up to the last chapter. The ending just doesn't match Starling's character."
2,Worst Possible Ending,"Of all the ways Harris could have ended this book, the ending he chose is easily the worst. The plot of the book is average, and the book lacks the eerieness and the mystery of the first two books, and in parts of the book, Harris uses Italian prases and then doesn't translate them for you. Early in the book, Dr. Lecter has the same presence as in the first two, but by the end his image is ruined. Harris changes him so much that I wished I had never picked up the book because it has ruined The Silence of the Lambs, and The Red Dragon for me."
2,11 years and still waiting.....,"The long awaited sequel seems to be Harris' attempt to live and love vicariously through Hannibal. The narcissistic Hannibal is borish and unbelievable. The few moments of true suspense are few and far between, what should be more rare is the excessive rehashing of Silence Of the Lambs storyline. In the end Harris mearly sets himself up for another book. I will wait for some reviews before shelling out for another example of Harris selling out!"
4,Sizzling !,"Hang-in and get past the first 100 or so pages and you will not be disappointed. Thomas Harris delivers us Hannibal in his finest form, albeit, with a somewhat slow start. If you have a vivid imagination, you should read this book. Be warned though, it is not for the weak of stomach. Find a quiet place and read it slowly in order to digest every word."
4,cheap sadistic thrills,"Here's a quote from the book (p. 127) that says it all: ""Now that ceaseless exposure has calloused us to the lewd and the vulgar, it is instructive to see what still seems wicked to us. What still slabs the clammy flab of our submissive consciousness hard enough to get our attention."""
1,"Don't believe the hype,this book is awful.","It took me three monthes to finally finish this book.I couldn't bare to pick it up after I had passed the half way mark.It had little suspense,the characters had little or no substance and the story dragged on like a root canal.Harris spent so much time building up to what was supposed to be an epic feast that he left me hungrier than the wild pigs he spent too much time describing.I feel sorry for all the people who have waited years for this book,they were robbed.I usually don't feel so angry after reading a bad book,but all I see is rave reviews for a book that is not deserving of them.The author spends a great deal of time speaking of Lector's ""memory palace"",I'm going to wipe it from mine.If Jodie Foster is smart she'll avoid signing up for the film."
2,A stop and go book...,"I started off really enjoying the book and couldn't put it down. Then around the middle of the book, the part set in Italy, I stopped for about 2 months. I felt that he was trying to impress me with his description of Italy and it's history rather than tell the story. When I finally started again, I moved through it pretty quickly, partially to finish. I found some of the characters, plot and outcome very unbeliveable. Not trying to give it away, I just found it inplausible. I must admit that I did enjoy some insight into Dr. Lector's mind and his past. This understanding, however, did not clear my confusion of certain things and event which might have resulted from unbelievability. Since Since I've heard the first two books are so good, I don't think that ""Hannibal"" will put me off from reading them. I'm not even sure that I'd see the movie- unless Hollywood drastically changes it."
1,Starling trades in gun for breast feeding job,"The book is just plain bad. There is none of the behavioral science mystery solving we loved in Silence. Our strong Heroine is suduced by Lecter with drugs and volunteers to spend the rest of her days being his Freudian pacifier, literally. She is like the anti-Clarice and it insults young poor women who work hard. The office politcs is stolen from the X-files and Krendler might as well be the cigrette smoking man. Harris must have needed money."
1,Save your time and save your money.,"Save your time and save your money.This book is a total waste. It has no real purpose and no real ending. There is the obligate sceens of sadism and canabilism. They serve no real purpose. Shame on the author. At the end of the day, I really felt cheated."
3,Is it good or is it bad? Who knows?,"It is almost impossible to judge this book by standards used for other books. By those standards it is a horrible book in which the author betrays his reading audience in a myriad of ways. Many of the reviews by readers in this section reflect just that reality. The first third of the book is overwritten, the second long and irrelevant, and the third - with its unusual ending - a betrayal of the characters we came to love in Silence of the Lambs. In spite of this I found the ending to be highly disturbing and had to ask myself if in fact the author intended to disturb the reader in just this fashion. It stimulates thought that doesn't easily end and that is uncommon in ANY book these days. Buy it but be forewarned the book is not like anything you are expecting."
1,I'd like to get my brain washed out,"Do you ever feel like that? I know that we humans are said to use only ten percent of our brains or something, but even with all that excess capacity I dislike using any of it to store the details of this book.Devoid of suspense, consisting of moving from one grotesque Hannibal Lector Moment to another, and concluding with what has to be the least satisfying conclusion to a novel ever to see print, this book was an utter waste of time. I only read it because I loved ""Red Dragon"" and ""Silence of the Lambs.""Understand, I can't blame Harris for cranking out this dopey sequel. He probably did all right financially with the previous two, but with Hannibal Lector now nearly an institution, there's big, big money for him in the sequels. A man has to take care of himself and his family, so more power to him.For me, I think I'm done with the good doctor."
2,So much potential........,"In what could be described as one of the biggest disappointments in literary history, Thomas Harris' Hannibal failed to meet expectations. Meeting these huge expectations could be difficult enough but Harris looked more than up to the task in the first two thirds of the book. There was excitement and intrigue, I could hardly wait to finish. However, the remaining 50-70 pages could only be described as ""hurried"". The ending appeared as though it were written by a high school sophomore attempting to finish their homework early so they can go to a movie. Besides being hurried, the ending was also, in my humble opinion, ridiculous. I won't go into details, but trust me, opt to read another book"
1,What the...?,"Who would have guessed that such an expertly rendered series would degenerate into harlequin romance so suddenly and compeletely? To be fair, I was enthralled for the first 98% of this novel. It was the last 2% that I found so utterly disappointing. My advice to a prospective reader is to buy the cheapest paperback copy of this book that you can find and rip out the last chapter. If I had omitted the final chapter from my reading, I would have given Hannibal a 4-star rating instead of 1."
1,What the ... Hey,"I've just wasted one day of my life reading what was meant to be the long awaited sequel to Red Dragon and SOTL. How disappointing it was to finally get to the end, after reading all of that banal claptrap about Florence (who cares about Florence) and feel like you've been cheated."
2,"Strange Book, Implausible Ending, Poor Editing","I waited for the sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"" for 10 years, and I suppose nothing could live up to my expectations. However, I did NOT expect Clarice Starling's bizarre behavior at the end of Harris's work; in fact, there was no motivation for it that I could find in the book to justify it. Unless, perhaps, Dr. Lecter performed a lobotomy on her, without our knowing it? What a major disappointment... The reader is provided with a complex villain in Mason Verger, however."
1,Total Garbage,Nevermind the fact that I really hate books with foreign language phrases inserted all over the place. It's like going into a room and then asking to leave and then coming back in. I too was very disappointed in the ending to this book. Totally out of character for Clarice to become a cannibal and flashing forward 3 years to find out that her and Hannibal are lovers. It took Harris 10+ years to come with this? Please give me a break.
3,Silence of the Lambs 2 - A Love Story,"If I had to sum up my feelings in one word, it would be ""ambivalent."" The ending was disturbing (I finished the book at night and had trouble sleeping) so, as a horror novel, one could argue that the book was successful.But as disturbing as I found the ending, I'm not convinced that it made sense given the characters and their arcs. Moreover, what Harris does to generate empathy for Lecter detracts, I think, from the quality of Lecter's character. The great thing about Lecter in the prior books, particularly SOTL, is that he was monstrous and there was no reason for his monstrosity (""Nothing happened to me. I happened""). Now, all of a sudden, we're privy to his childhood trauma and can almost excuse his prior acts. And his acts of mayhem in the current book tend towards self-protection.There's much to commend in this book. But the ending and the devices used to generate easy empathy for Hannibal may leave a bad taste in your mouth."
4,A satisfying sequel to The Silence of the Lambs,"In this satisfying sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, Thomas Harris avoids ripping himself off-the blight of most sequels. Like in his earlier work, the story is riveting and the characters are mesmerizing. The only problem is the ending, which, though intriguing, is not quite believable"
3,"Great book, bad ending","I liked the book until the last 10 chapters. This ending made me so sick I cried. The first part of the book was great but I don't know if it makes up for the end. The only way I change my mind about the end of the screenplay, or soon to be screenplay, is if Thomas gets Courtney Love to remake the song ""Wind beneath my wings"" for the final scene of the movie. Then and only then will I change my mind."
2,A big letdown,Harris got all the hype and then left us holding the bag. Characters are unbelievable and the ending out of this world. To wait so long for the sequal to Silence of the Lambs is a big letdown. Book could be half its size and tell twice the story. Gore is in with Harris.
4,Debunks the Lecter Myth,"This was a really funny book. I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't howl through this. It starts off as vintage Harris (although having an opening shootout was a hackneyed idea--I think really good stories open quietly and then build), becomes an Elmore Leonard caper, and ends up ludicrous and unbelievable, like Brett Easton Ellis. The plot, like Silence and Red Dragon, is magnificently crafted but I think that with Hannibal, Harris has properly debunked the Lecter myth. It is, like its predecessors, just a story, you know."
2,Disappointing,"I'm only giving it two stars because Mr. Harris did keep me glued until the bitter end. Otherwise, I'd give it one star. The ending is just completely implausible and idiotic. I considered it an insult to what little intelligence the author gives me credit for.If you're like the 2 or 3 other million people in the country and decide to read it against my advice, grab a dictionary. Mr. Harris likes to place 5 syllable words where a single syllable would do just fine. And don't use a Webster's dictionary either -- he uses words not found in that particular dictionary."
3,...,"Being a huge Thomas Harris fan, I greatly anticipated the release of ""Hannibal"". I bought it on it's release date, read about a third of it the first day, hoping it would get better. I was mistaken. Being the high-grossing movie it was turned into, I'm sure you know what it's about. The writing style is exceptionally well, yet the story lacked a major plot. ""Hannibal"" was OK, but should have been edited. If you're still interested in reading this, make sure you read the Hannibal Lecter trilogy in this order:1. Red Dragon2.Silence of the Lambs3.Hannibal..."
3,"Hannibal was great, but lacked fulfilling ending",Thomas Harris has a wondering style of writing and develops his characters with skill throughout Hannibal. I found the book to be riveting and worthwhile reading...until I got to the last 30 pages. I was extremely disappointed with the ending and found it to almost be a cop-out for the author to hand it over to the publisher.
2,Hannibal: A Love Story?,"Hannibal should have been called, Hannibal: A Love Story. In the end, all of the protagonists - Hannibal, Barney, and Margot end up happily ever after in loving romances. Hannibal with Clarice, another protagonist and most unpredictable character. Hannibal, Barney and Margot are all the masculine aggressors. This is most important with Hannibal, who somewhat nakedly ""saves"" Clarice. I remember the first two books to be better, though this was entertaining and compelling. This one was a bit too cartoonish. It was a bit to much of an adolescent fantasy. One gets the impression that Thomas Harris is hoping for a movie version in order to see Jodi Foster naked."
3,Skip the last ten pages.,"Liked ""Red Dragon"", loved ""Silence of the Lambs"", and was really looking forward to this. The main part of this book, while not breathtakingly exciting, was very interesting to read. I liked seeing this different, cultured side of Lecter, one of the most interesting characters/villians ever. However, I was absolutely astounded at the ridiculous ending involving Starling, one of the most compelling female characters I have ever read. It was like someone else wrote the ending. Does Harris not have family, friends, editors who can be brutally honest with him? If they make a movie out of this, and I hope they do (and I hope they can get Hopkins out of retirement; he would relish this deeper, cultured side of Lecter) they had better do a serious re-write on the ending."
3,disappointment,"I enjoyed Silence of the Lambs & I looked forward to reading this book. I was very disappointed with the book, especially the ending. I'm not sure if I want to see the movie."
4,Yummy seconds (or thirds if that's how you see it),"I really liked this book. The ending (I won't spoil it for you) I didn't exspect. It wasn't as creepy as 'Silence' but just as gory, if not more so. It was about Dr. Lecter after he escaped (6 years after). It tells the story of Manson Verger, a man he mamnied years prior to 'Silence.' Clairece is back, along with Barney and Jack Crawford. A few scenes were interestingly unpredictable but the rest of the novel follows Harris's stream of historical interest. If you enjoyed 'The Silence of the Lambs' and Lecters and Starlings twisted relationship (like me) you'll enjoy the book. Worth buying, if you do."
4,I anxiously await the follow-up to this mystery ...,"I enjoyed this book and found it to be scary and suspenseful. The story ends on a perfect note, leaving the reader wondering if Clarice will ever escape ... and into what the offspring of Margot Verger (via Mason Verger) develops. I hope that Mr. Harris will write again ... and not make us wait for 7 years!"
1,A Book That was the biggest disappointment I've ever read,"How could Thomas Harris have done this? For once in my life, I can actually understand what the main character in 'Misery' felt like when her favorite author killed off her favorite character. This book was a good read, until the end, which was an utter and complete let down. Yes, Thomas Harris has found new and interesting ways to scare, gross-out and disgust, and so if you are curious, then this book will satisfy some of that curiosity. Read this book only if you have nothing else to read."
3,Wait until it comes out in paperback,"There were some things I liked - the FBI stuff, the shootout in the first chapter. I also found myself liking Hannibal - he had good reasons for killing some of those people. It was pretty well-written, but...I thought Mason's sister was ridiculous, and I was a little annoyed with the fact I predicted the ending. Everything tied together a little too neatly. I'm glad I didn't buy the book - it was a gift. I thought Silence of the Lambs was better."
2,Big Disappointment,"I really wanted to like this book in the worst way, but it just was not happening. All the realism that Silence had is thrown out the window in this one. Lecter has become almost like one of the bad guys from the Firday the 13th/Halloween movies. It would be easy to pick the book apart by going in depth about the story line, but don't want to spoil the book for anyone. Face it, no matter how many bad reviews are written, you will still want to read it. If this ever gets made into a movie, count on it being vastly different from the book."
1,sadly disappointing,"Those who loved Clairce Starling will be disappointed that she has the same types (nothing new) of flashbacks and thought patterns. Those who were breathless at the back and forth slickness of Hannibal and Starling may become angered that Hannibal now triumphs with the greatest of ease, to become the ultimate winner. The book was written as though the author simply became tired of his heroes, so created even greater monsters but tied their stories to the more clever characters, and then threw in a plot which is wholly unbelievable. It's more like ""horror surfing"" and far less sublime than any of his previous writing."
4,The ending could have been a little better,I am not going to harp on the ending which I still do not understand. I think it goes against what I thought Starling was about but maybe we'll find out more in the 4th one. You figure there has to be a 4th. Maybe with Will Graham coming back. Does anyone else find it strange that Harris did not bring him back from Red Dragon? I keep thinking he has grand plans for the future books.
1,Your Kidding!!,"I'm shocked! Coming from one of the best books I have ever read (Silence of the Lambs) to one of the worst. This story was totally disjointed, with no real excitement or intensity. That ending fell apart completely. I will hope that I dont have to revisit this farce being advertised as the sequel on the big screen. You failed us Mr. Harris!!!!"
3,a great book until the end.,"This book was great, until it ended, or should i say crashed. at least the doc has a new pal to savor. i'm hoping that he eats her liver with some pork and beans and an icy cold zima. we need to get this story back on track with some gratuitous evil so that will graham can come out of retirement (again) and save us all (again)."
3,Disappointing after such a long wait for this sequel!,"It seems almost as though parts of this book were written as a screen play, and it makes the flow choppy and puzzling at times. It is not Harris's best work. During the entire novel I was rooting for Dr. Lecter, which felt odd. The ending was a total disappointment, and hard to believe. I felt that most of the violence and gory situations were added for shock value only, and not because they played an integral part in the telling of the story, as in ""Silnce Of The Lambs"" (which may be the best book I've ever read!). I'm not sure I'd recommend this book to the average reader, as it leaves a bad taste in your mouth that lasts for days after the last page has been read."
2,Pitiful,"If you want to experience mindless psychological terror watch the news from Kosovo. If you want to read a GREAT novel, try ""The Triumph and the Glory"". I read it between missions and it was VERY inspiring. If you want to read something sensitive, try ""Stones from the River"" and if you just want to be entertained you can't beat Bill Murray's new autobiograpy. But it is obvious Harris could care less about what he put in Hannibal because he knew it would sell into the stratosphere no matter how much it reeked. And believe me, it reeked."
1,"It was so boring,I have yet to finish it.","There are times when I'm reading several books at a time. I eventually finish all, but have not been able to complete ""Hannibal"". A book must really be a page turner to hold my interest. And frankly, I have better things to do."
2,Bummer of a sequel!,"Definitely interesting and engrossing at times, but the ending was totally disappointing and unbelievable. Very grotesque and graphic, and trips down memory lane for Dr. Lechter seemed silly to me. Hope the screenplay adaptation is much improved!"
1,Recipe for disaster,"Take the worst books of Anne Rice, Mary Higgins Clark, and Stephen King (that's a lot of books!). Toss them into a word processor and mix at high speed. When the consistency is farly pulpy, fold in Dante's Inferno, any available Florentine travelogue, and Hawking's A Brief History of Time. Blend for ten years. Serve chilled, in an expensive decanter.And now the remedy: Stephen Dobyns' ""The Church of Dead Girls"", Ian McEwan's ""The Comfort of Strangers"", Patrick McGrath's ""Asylum"", or Iris Johansen's ""Long After Midnight.Mr."
1,Skip the end,"I believe there are one hundred chapters in this book (give or take a few). My advice is to read the first 99 chapters and write your own ending. You would undoubtedly come up with a more plausible and satisfying chapter. I was intrigued with the majority of the book and interested in the progression of the story. I must agree with other reviewers, however, regarding the disappointment I felt when Harris attempted to put meaning and victimization behind Lecter's evil. Lecter was infinitely more monstrous when his motives were shrouded in mystery. Simply said, I wish I had closed the book before the final chapter. If I had, I would have left it without such a bitter taste in my mouth."
1,Disappointing and ridiculous!,"I read both Dragon and Lambs and was terrified. I didn't find Hannibal scary in the least. The descriptions sounded like a 12 year old boy trying to ""gross people out"" by talking about bodily functions at the dinner table. I thought the ending was improbable and silly."
1,Ick!,"This book completely loses the flavor(excuse the pun) of ""Silence of the Lambs"". Be prepared to suspend all disbelief about Starlings character and get ready for her to act completely contrary to the gutsy and self-contained woman we admired in the previous novel. I think Thomas Harris wrote this book so he could have a sequel for a movie deal. I would have given it a 0 star if that option had been available."
3,"What a horrible way to silence the lambs, Clarice.","Great book...until the end. Lame, twisted, stupid, rushed, out-of-ideas, out-of-character ending. Drugs and hypnosis? I think it would have worn off before the ""Buenos Aires, three years later..."" Jodie Foster ain't reprising her role not because the paycheck is too small, but because her character goes off the deep end. Good for Foster. I heard they're changing the ending for the movie anyway. Let's hope it's better than the ending in the book."
2,Needs to be sent back to the kitchen,"After a fast paced, cinematic opening the book slows to a crawl and barely creeps. Harris exchanges plot for a romp through the grotesque that freezes the action rather than pushes it onward. I started the novel delighted to be meeting old friends but finished it feeling my time had been wasted, as had the characters. Enough has already been said about the ending. If this scrambled narrative moves to the movies it will need some serious rewrites with an eye to widening the lense beyond the freakish. Its now a modern Dracula story that left this reader feeling drained, not by the horror but by the effort to maintain hope that the writing would ultimately redeem the storyline. No such luck. If this was a meal I'd send it back to the kitchen."
3,disappointing,"This book never really captured the imagination in the same fashion as ""Silence of the Lambs"". The book kept you somewhat involved until the last 50 pages then it feel apart, as if the author did not know quite where to go from there. The ending was unsatisfying."
3,"LAMBS,DRAGONS,HANNIBAL, AND GOD!","I ordered four books for my vacation. First, there was the good, The Silence of the Lambs. A very good book and must read. Then, there was the bad, Hannibal. Good plot, not so good ending, and the ending in my opinion should be one of the best parts if not the best part of the book. And there was great, The Red Dragon. I loved that novel, much better than the others. I also would recommend a novel called, THE FIST OF GOD, by A.T. Nicholas. It's a great supernatural thriller."
3,What happened??,"A wonderful book to read until the end. I enjoyed the characters and imagery, until the end. Don't read this expecting Silence of the Lambs or The Red Dragon, Hannibal falls flat and left this reader disappointed."
5,Harris has done it again!,"From the beginning to the end, Hannibal was thrilling and mysterious. He did an excellent job of introducing Starling, Lecter, and all of the other characters, so if you hadn't read the Silence of The Lambs, you could pick up the story easily. I recommend it to everybody"
5,Weren't you expecting a romance?,"I certainly was, and thanks to Mr. Harris, received one. From the moment of Clarice and Hannibal's first touch in SILENCE, I expected the good doctor to become obsessed. And wouldn't any woman be flattered by such a man's attentions?The ending was haunting and raised all sorts of wonderful questions for the reader. Will the two begin a killing spree together? Or will Clarice be the steadying force to Dr Lector's madness? Will they expand Clarice's limited knowledge of human cuisine? Will they have a child? Can Will Graham get himself rehabilitated enough to chase after the duo?The book was not another SILENCE, nor should it have been. The book was written for Hannibal alone, as the title implies. And, for Hannibal, it was a happy ending."
5,Still thinking,"From time to time, I was annoyed at the change of viewpoint, narrative, first person.. but it often gave me the feeling that Lecter himself was narrating the story. I'm not sure how I feel about the ending, but it wasn't a cop-out. Maybe he could have been a little more exploratory there.. talking us through some of the deeper wells of psychology that many of us are missing. However, this is not a book for those readers who want to be hand fed the meaning of everything. It was a deliberate ending with deep meaning, and it ties into Lecter's past. I enjoyed the book, and was not disturbed or dissapointed in the ending one bit. Thank you, Mr. Harris."
1,Hannibal is Horrible,"After eagerly awaiting the sequel to Silence of the Lambs, I was very disappointed with Hannibal.If you liked the author's two previous books, DON'T read Hannibal."
2,Disapointment,"If I wanted to read an Ann Rice novel, I would have a purchased an Ann Rice novel. I enjoyed 85% of ""Hannibal"" but the last 15% was terribly disappoint. You'll understand why when you finish the book."
2,Let Down,I vote with the two star customer review. Starlings character not at all like her previous roll. Hollywood may be able to have a better ending; at least hope so. I felt let down by the end of the book.
2,And then...AND THEN...splat,"I pretty much enjoyed the read, anxiously awaiting the conclusion. Only to find the conclusion completely unbelievable. It's as if Harris just ran out of time (10 years not enough?) figuring out how it should end, and settled for something that fell, splat, on the floor."
1,Disgusting exploitation of an audience,"Whether you liked, or didn't like, Silence of Lambs (I liked it alot) .... DON'T Read this book. It is disgustingly exploitive of its audience with just barely enough plot to weave together the various episodes of insanity of the type we usually only read about in courtroom accounts (unfortunately). Unless you often immerse your mind in filth, skip this one entirely. The worse part of it all is that (1) this one is obviously soon to be on the silver screen- probably a big hit and (2) there is an audience for this filth (I'll have nightmares about that aspect for awhile)."
2,Was not as intense as his other books,"I was very disappointed in this book!! as it lacked ""the edge of my seat"" page turner, as his other books gave me."
2,No Comparison to Silence of the Lambs,"I have been hooked on Hannibal Lecter since first viewing the movie ""Manhunter"". I read ""Red Dragon"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" and anxiously waited for 'Silence' to be made into a movie. I bought ""Hannibal"" on audio cassette the very week it was released because I wanted to learn about Lecter's latest escapades. ""Hannibal"" is no comparison to ""Silence of the Lambs"". Starling's role in this book is disappointing. The ending of ""Hannibal"" left a lot to be desired. If the movie ever gets made, I won't be rushing out to see it."
2,Bad Endings,"I had been dying to read this book since the first news it was coming out. Finally I got my hands on a copy and devoured it. I loved it. The suspense, the characters. I loved The Silence of the Lambs and felt this book was a good follow up, until the last few chapters anyway. I feel the ending is totally out of character for the heroine. The turn of events at the end just don't make sense for the Starling that was introduced in Silence. Now I understand why Jodi Foster isn't going to be in the movie. I won't give it away for those who haven't read the book, but be ready for a shock. I'm glad I read it, but I was dissapointed."
2,Not a worthy follow-up,"Pedestrian would be the best description. Nothing new here - just a rehash of Silence of the Lambs, and not in a good way. Isn't anything that hasn't been seen in works by Stephen King or John Saul, and the ending was not shocking but just plain strange."
4,Definitely not for everyone,"Readers expecting another man-hunt/mystery are in for a disappointment with this third Hannibal Lecter installment. However, I was pleasantly surprised that Harris ended the saga the way he did.Though _Hannibal_ has been greatly criticized for the characterization of Starling, I never found myself doubting the veracity of her character. Several of the last moments bordered on the surreal, but I was completely satisfied with the conclusion Harris chose. While some readers might see it as a slap-dash ending, I see it as a slap in the face of every person who pushed him to finish this book before he was ready. Hannibal, Clarice, and Thomas Harris all have the last laugh, and I loved every minute."
1,Jodie hated it...nuff said,"After reading the book, Jodie Foster said that she would in no uncertain terms imagine reprising her role of Clarice, because the character had become totally unbelievable. While she and Anthony H. await the re-write for the script, everyone else who has not been witness to this ridiculous pice of garbage should await the movie and see if the screenwriters can salvage the mess."
4,Not as good as Silence of the Lambs,"This book isn't really that bad. It's nicely written, but when you get down to it, the plot isn't very original (a nemises bent on revenge). I liked Hannibal Lecter better in TSOTL, because this book wasn't as ""creepy"" when Lecter is free. We do get a look at his private life, and learn that he is a fine art lover and is an accomplished piano player. This book is more of an action book then a ""suspenseful"" one. The ending, however, was quite surprising. If you liked Silence of the Lambs, it's a good bet you'll like this one."
1,Disappointing!,"This book is a disappointment, poorly written and not well thought out. Expected better!"
5,Can't wait 'til 2010,"So,Mr Harris,what happens next?The most brilliantly disturbing book I have ever read."
2,The Ending Isn't The Only Cheesy Thing About The Novel,"Three different novels: one third action film, one third flat, quasi-literary travelogue, and the final third pretentious allegory. The action film is thrilling, the Florence travelogue stuffy, and the allegory insufferable."
3,I liked most of it,"I was totally into this book at first. My dad gave it to me after he had read it and said, ""You'll love it, it's great."" After finishing it and replaying it's events in my mind, I found many actions and situations presented to be unbelievable. Furthermore the characters you know become less like the characters you know as you draw toward the end. Still, as I stated, I liked most of it. I would put this in book in the ""fun to read"" catagory. I wouldn't take it as seriously as The Silence of the Lambs."
4,Great except for the ending,"The book was great...wonderful and intricate plot, terrific imagery, great characters...but the ending, while intriguing and vaguely satisfying, left a bad taste in my mouth. However, I'm eagerly anticipating the film ""Hannibal,"" now that I've read the book. It should be terrific."
1,Taking thrillers to a new level of degregation,"I do enjoy my thrillers. Silence of the Lambs was a fantastic fast paced book with exciting action. This book pushes the sick and macabre to new levels. In an effort to be more grotesque than any other writer, Mr Harris sacrifices everything it takes to make a truly satisfying thriller."
2,who are these people? am I supposed to know them?,"I just don't know what to think. It's an interesting plot and it's plain that Harris is more than just a pulp thriller writer (sure do want to visit Florence now). I preferred Silence of the Lambs. I just can't imagine Starling ending up as she does. I worry that without Jonathan Demme to humanize/edit the story, this movie will fail. I don't think I'll be buying anyone this book"
2,Disappointing and unbelievable,"I can't believe that Mr. Harris signed his name to this drivel. Did he think the readers would forget the basic elements in the characters' personalities? The ending is shocking, which would not be bad, except that it is also inadequately explained. There are so many ways this novel could have gone - I wish Mr. Harris had chosen a different option."
3,Sell out,"Although this book was entertaining, it wasn't half as good as Harris's other books. The interestingly evil character in this book is Mason Verger, not Lecter. Lecter is explained away as simply a man doing bad things because of the traumatic loss of his sister. This is all put right though when he settles down with a good woman. Puleeze, what a cop out. Seems like Lecter was just a lonely man looking for domestic bliss and fine food all along. What a silly ending. i can't see why Stephen King gave this book such a good review."
2,Ugh!,"It cannot be overstated what a disappointment this book is! Harris abandons the masterful, nigh-unbearable it-could-really-happen tension of his previous books and just goes off the cartoonish deep end here. The Italy section is very good, but the rest of the book is just preposterous and insulting."
1,"Ugh! The ""Alien 3"" of the Lecter trilogy",Ending is just like getting the rug pulled out from under you. Why bother to build characters one can identify with if you are going to do what this book has done at the end? Starling is not Starling. Jack Crawford was utterly wasted -- why not just leave him out entirely?Harris spends a lot of effort trying to make Mason Verger an evil man and Lecter more or less a hero. I felt manipulated and did not buy it.
2,DULL book with great ending!,"I disagree about Hannibal's ending, I loved it! the first two thirds of the book were so excruiatingly boring though, that I can't recomend it to anyone. Read Silence of The Lambs and Red Dragon instead!"
3,"Great Start, Flat Ending","This book starts off great. Harris does everything but the predicatble in this story. The story starts seven years after Starling's apprehension of Buffalo Bill, and you may be surprised to learn that her career in the FBI has been less than stellar.Everyone in the book is searching for Hannibal, the FBI, Starling, and a former victim of Lecture. The beginning of the book is beautifully written. Some of the description of the characters and the locations (especially Florence) are breath-taking.The ending of the story is entirely unbelievable and disappointing. I would have a better time believing in the tooth fairy."
2,Well written but disappointing overall.,"The quality of the writing is excellent but I have to agree with some of the other reviewers -- this is not a fit sequel to ""The Silence of The Lambs"". The clumsy inclusion of a previous victim was difficult for me to swallow and the ending was almost impossible to accept. The final chapters read like one of Philip K. Dick's novels where he had run out of amphetamine and needed to finish it quickly. I wish I'd waited for the paperback."
3,Waste of a good Chianti,"I eagerly awaited ""Hannibal"" for years, having fallen in love with ""Red Dragon"" and ""Silence of the Lambs."" When ""Hannibal"" fianlly arrived I couldn't wait, and there are parts of the book that flew by for me. However, the whole Italy section drags in the book and is way to long. When Hannibal arrives in America the book takes off again, untill the ending which is severe let down. Mason Veger 1is worthy opponent to Dr. Lector and I wished for more scenes with him and Clarice or Lector... The ending has to be the most stupid ending I have ever read. There is no way the character of Clarice Starling would behave the way she does. I wanted redemption for Clarice and instead got a an FBI agent that falls in love with a serial killer??!! I was so mad at the end, I threw the book across the room...Thank God, they changed the ending for the movie, which I actually enjoyed."
2,EXTREMELY Disappointing!!!,"I thorougly enjoyed ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Red Dragon"", so I was excited to read ""Hannibal"". What a HUGE disappointment!!! The previous novels I read until all hours of the night, and couldn't put them down. With ""Hannibal"", it was all I could do to keep reading to see what happens to the monster. The series of events in this novel were completely predictable and Harris' emphasis seemed to be on the gore rather than the story and characters. While his previous novels had great cliffhanger endings, the ending to ""Hannibal"" left room for a next novel, at best! The difference is, I won't purchase the next novel! I was VERY generous giving the book 2 stars!"
1,Worse than disappointing.,"If you loved the movie ""Highlander"", and then were disgusted at how the sequel was so bad in so many ways that it almost dragged down its brilliant precursor with it, you'll know what it's like to read this book. Not worth the time nor the money."
2,Had Moments - But Disappointing,"While I found this piece had the elements to keep my attention, pulling me in and driving me to turn each page, the ending was a major disappointment. Especially in the case of Starling, the conclusion is entirely out of character. It doesn't show a different side of her character, instead the book displays an unbelievable side. However, we've been set up for one more piece in the series. Should Harris decide to write it, I hope the final conclusion is more satisfying than this one."
1,Is Harris kidding us?,"What a diabolical offering. My question is ""did Thomas Harris really write this?"" The book is riddled with spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. Where is the grace with which Silence of the Lambs was written? The characters (esp. Hannibal) are all reduced to caricatures. The crime scenes are so over-the-top that instead of being left with that feeling of abject horror, you just skim through them.In Silence of the Lambs, Harris displayed an awesome understanding of human nature and the tiny flaws in our characters which make us so intriguing. Reading Hannibal, I was left with a feeling that he was stumbling about, not really getting to grips with his characters. It reads like it was written by a committee.I hope 'they' don't make a movie out of this."
1,Billy Crystal was right!!!,"From all the praise heralded by other readers, I wonder if I had the wrong book sent to me by mistake. There is no way this is a three star book, much less a 5 star one. I forced myself to finish it, and then regreted turning the last page. If only I had been like Billy Crystal in ""Harry met Sally"", and read the last page of the book before starting it...(so if I died before finishing it, I'd know how it ended), I could have saved myself an entire weekend of agony and bitter disapppointment...not to mention the money wasted on this novel. When I heard the book was coming out, I couldn't wait...and started holding my breath for the movie. Now, given the unbelievable (and unforgivable) ending Harris chose to tack onto this list of incomplete sentences...I am no longer waitng to exhale. Mr. Harris, why????"
2,Thomas Harris should have taken 12 years instead of 11,"Eagerly the most anticipated book of 1999, Thomas Harris' ""Hannibal"" is a wonderfully written book. That being said, it has the most dissapointing endings ever put to paper. Hannibal Lecter is as chariming and frightening as ever, however, even he cannot make sense of the ending. Mr. Harris took 11 years to write the third Hannibal Lecter book. Perhaps he needed 12. Memo to Dino De Laurentis & Co.: PLEASE, FOR THE MOVIE, CHANGE THE ENDING!!!"
3,YOU WON'T LOSE SLEEP OVER IT,"After rave reviews I was expecting a novel I couldn't put down...not the case. My intentions were to pull the pin at chapter 75, but I perservered and finished it. I would have liked to have taken an axe to it...dr lecter style. Overall not a bad read...but not the best."
4,Hannibal,"Hannibal is an amazing book. Thomas Harris the author used amazing details and creativity to write this thrilling book. It kept me on the edge of my seat. The amount of care that Harris used to make this grafic novel is scarey. The book is about Dr. Hannibal Lector, an excaped killer. He is a well known doctor, genius and lunitic. He has killed many people and he is known to eat his victims. He has been atlarge for seven years. In this book Millionaire Mason Verger, the only person who has ever survived Hannibal. He will stop at nothing to get revenge on Hannibal. He uses his large funds and many connections to hunt Lector down. Everyone in this novel wants somthing and the greedier they get the more likely they are to recieve the rath of Lector. Harris puts you on a roller coaster ride in this book. That gets summed up in a twist ending."
3,not as good as the prequel,"If you really sunk your teeth into ""Silence of the Lambs"" you have no choice but to read this sequel. Parts of it did have bite. However, it did drag in spots. The ending was ridiculous."
4,A Gourmet Treat,"I found this novel to to the best of the three by Mr. Harris about Hannibal Lector. I particularly enjoyed the teasing out of parallel developments between Lector and Starling, which explains why he was originally attracted to her. I will not give away the ending except to say that the villian gets his just deserts."
3,I hope the movie is better.,"While Harris creates interesting characters and situations, this book is not well written. It reads like a screenplay for the movie, as it is too heavy on describing scenes and minor details. As expected, the violent details are gory beyond belief. The end of the book was an absolute shock to me, and I found it too implausible. I understand that the movie will be altered, which I look forward to seeing."
3,Good for a while,"The first half is actually pretty good. The scene where he kills the Italian policeman is very well done, if you like that sort of thing, and the pages describing Lecter's plane ride back to the States are excellent. After that Harris seems to have lost interest and decided just to get the damn thing done. The much derided ending seems to be a gesture of contempt towards everybody who insisted he finish the book."
3,Disappointing ending,"Most of the book was actually rather interesting though parts were a bit grotesque. The ending, however, was terrible. It went on for at least fifteen pages in an implausible and revolting haze."
2,"3/4 Description, 1/4 action","I enjoyed SOTL the novel very much, as I read it in one sitting. However, Hannibal was disappointing, As it Mr. Harris spent 450 pages of the book describing Italy, and 30 telling the events in the book. Even though it had a good climax, it was mostly a boring read. Only a very very hardcore Harris fan/Lecterite should buy this book."
2,Disappointing,"A sequel to the excellent ""Silence of the Lambs"" was eagerly awaited. Unfortunately, it was a huge let-down. The Clarice Starling from the former book had strength, integrity, determination, fortitude, and a working moral compass. In the latter book, however, Starling has been reduced to a quivering, mindless idiot with no will of her own who sinks into a quagmire of debauchery. Much of ""Hannibal"" is set in Italy, and the reader is provided with some insight into the factors which came into play and exploded to produce a Hannibal Lecter. Although we begin to see into the tormented mind of this man, we gain little sympathy for him. The writing itself is dark and as dense as a thick fog. I was incensed by the ending and thought it did a huge disservice to its predecessor. I found it to be forced and contrived and, frankly, I was insulted by it. I expected better from the estimable Mr. Harris."
4,What a surprise!,"This book was not nearly as graphic as Silence of the Lambs, however it has a very strange twist to it. Took me a chapter or two to get into it, but when I did it was quick reading...you just have to holdout for the end!"
4,Hannibal crosses the Alps...,"and enters Italy, the cruciible of art, opera, and all things that Hannibal loves. I have read Tom Harris' previous books and have been constantly amazed at his ability to describe his characters. In Hannibal we see the beautiful and the macabre twisted together like some kind of strange DNA in one person, maybe not in this case fully explained (is it possible! ) but illustrated wiith amazing skill. Be prepared to read about a strange psychopath and his quest for control."
1,DISAPPOINTING FROM BEGINNING TO END!,I'VE READ ALL HARRIS' PREVIOUS BOOKS AND FOUND HANNIBAL BORING AND DULL. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. READING THIS BOOK LEFT ME FEELING THAT HARRIS HAD TAKEN A TRIP TO ITALY AND WANTED TO SHOW OFF WHAT HE HAD LEARNED ABOUT THE COUNTRY AT THE EXPENSE OF TELLING WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD STORY. I FEEL SORY IF SOMEONE IS READING HANNIBAL AS A FIRST-TIME EXPERIENCE BECAUSE THEY WON'T KNOW HOW GOOD HARRIS CAN BE.
2,Welcome to the Exhibit of the Instruments of Torture,"When I re-read RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS shortly after seeing the movie of SILENCE, it frightened me more than anything in either of the books that Thomas's Harris's identification somehow had shifted from being with the FBI to being with Hannibal the Cannibal.HANNIBAL more than bears this feeling out. The key to understanding this book is the scene in which Dr. Lecter visits the exhibit on instruments of torture. He doesn't give them much attention but watches the reaction of the visitors with disgust and his usual sense of superiority.We, dear readers, are the visitors to the torture show and this book is Harris's one-in-the-eye, over-the-top offering to us thrown as though to a pack of jackals who are hungry for anything dead.If the reading public can't get enough of sickos and pyschos, then he's given us what we deserve."
1,Disappointing,"The Red Dragon and Silence Of The Lambs were grabbingly terrific. I don't think Harris could pass on the money for this one. Why else would he write something this shallow? If it wasn't the money, he's just run out of ideas. If you've run out of ideas on developing characters, leave them alone. This was a true disappointment..."
4,Everything but the ending,"I did not read Silence of the Lambs, saw the movie, loved it and then read Hannibal. I liked the book very much. It keep my attention and was a quick read. However, I was very disappointed in the ending. Just TOO unbelievable. I for one just cannot accept the ""Starling Ending"". I have to read the Red Dragon now, just to see for myself and can decide once and for all if I like Thomas Harris."
1,Regret,"That's a couple of days of my life I'll never get back. I'm not going to repeat what most others are saying here, except to say: ""Don't waste your time""."
1,Put paid to Hannibal and Harris,"In the first 100 pages we meet Mason whom Hannibal Lector tricks into slicing off his face with a piece of glass and feeding it bit by bit to starving dogs he's penned up. Then Hannibal breaks his neck and paralizes him. Mason does not die but rather lives in a wing of his house, behind a monacle (he cut out his other eye and the remaining eye must be misted for the dogs got BOTH eyelids) where he tortures orphaned black children into killing their kittens. This is revolting. My lord, I thought that I was immune from shock considering what I did in earlier days but this is too much. Realistic detail be damned; that defense could be used of Dr. Mengele's journals. This is perverse. If you read this, it will spoil your associations with the places where you read it. It ruined a vacation on South Padre Island for me."
4,Very suspensful story leading up to a terrible ending,"I plowed through this book at a quick pace because I was so energized by the story. Clarice and Hannibal are finally back. The story starts with the energy of ""Speed"" (the Movie). It unfolds quickly with no laboring to build a plot.However, the ending I found horrible. So unbelievable and just not ""in character"" - I almost put it down without finishing it.If you LOVED Silence - then get it. The first 3/4's are well worth it. Otherwise, wait for the movie (where HOPEFULLY the Director will take some license with the ending)."
3,Too bad the last several chapters weren't rewritten,"I can't say much more about the book that the others have not already said. The only thing I'd like to add is that I really enjoyed the first 3/4 of the story. During that portion I had intentions of going immediately to the bookstore to get ""Red Dragon"" after finishing this one. After learning the ending, I immediately went to the bookstore and bought a totally different book. I give three stars for the part I enjoyed. The last several chapters get ZERO stars."
1,Did not justice to Silence of the Lamb. Thumbs down!,The story had me at first and then it lost me quickly. Too much detail about the Italian Art history. Too much Italian to interpret. The ending was absolutely ludicrous!
2,"The ending gave me a big ""HUH???""","Harris pretty much throws you in the action of catching an enigmatic killer by a sick & demented victim, and spits you out by the ending. Part of me thinks that it was Harris' intention of totally disturbing the reader with its totally gothic & unpredicatable ending, and the other half may be just to let the reader realize that the whole ""Hannibal Lecter"" hype is no more than a big joke. Harris may have taken too much hallucinatory mushrooms by the time he wrote the conclusion.I really wanted to like this book since it was quite expensive (even if it was 50% off). What a waste. I couldn't even admit to my girlfriend how much I thought the novel wasted my time not to mention my enthusiasm."
2,"""Hannibal"" ending leaves bad taste in mouth","After finishing ""Hannibal,"" I was struck by a desire to find Thomas Harris and demand a refund. The ending of the book was easily the most disappointing, annoying, and baffling I've ever read. Was Harris trying to drive away loyal readers? Perhaps he'd been so pestered over the last 11 years to write the sequel, that he decided to get his revenge by concocting such an amazingly bad ending? I don't know. Maybe he grew tired of the book or simply wrote himself into a corner. Was it a weak effort at black humor? Who knows. In any event, it was a sad end to an otherwise highly engrossing book in particular, and trilogy in general."
4,This novel is a superb sequel to its predecessor.,"In this novel, Harris further expands on the events that happen after the escape of his horrifyingly realistic character, Hannibal Lecter. We are allowed a tiny glimpse into the hallways of Lecter's mind, and what one finds there can only be described as the remenants of one with great potential that was diseased and corrupted by a childhood trauma. I recommend that anyone with an interest in the psyche of a brilliant madman, imbibe this novel as well as its prequels The Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon."
4,Very creative and unpredictable,"I do not understand why people think Hannibal could follow the same path. I think Harris did an excellent job of taking the characters in a new direction. I could not put the book down as the ending was VERY unpredictable! We would have been bored with another ""Lambs"" this shows a lot of creativity to include another character almost as gruesome. Great read!"
1,A horror!,This is a book you can absolutely put down. In fact if you do put it down I'd respect you more. Why is America and the rest of the world getting so excited about a book about a serial killer? Is there nothing else we can get ourselves worked up over? Do the world a favor and buy any other book but this one.
3,"Ridiculous ending, very disappointing after a good build-up.","Much of the detailed and repetative descriptions of Italian locations was too wordy and unnecessary. Beyond that, the book picked up speed and intensity until the terribly disappointing ending, I came away angry I had read the whole thing. Definitely not recommended."
1,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!,"In retrospect fans of Red Dragon & The Silence Of The Lambs should have been content with those two masterpieces. Hanniball, which may be the most anticipated novel of modern fiction is an absolute dud. Most true fans of Thomas Harris's books will wonder how this embarassment took 11 years to complete. The book completely lacks the psychological tension that his previous books so cleverly demonstrated. I have already wasted enough time reading this joke, so to review it in its entirity would be compounding my mistake, but I will say that the ending to Hannibal is absolutely ridiculous and an insult to fans of his two previous works."
3,Disappointing,"This is my second book by Thomas Harris. I must say I found The Red Dragon far better and more entertaining. Hannibal is just too over the top and the ending just does not make much sense. Why would such a law abiding Sterling end up with a guy like that, short of brain washing? BTW, I just drove by Teatro Colon last night and I think I spotted them coming out."
2,Horror Story or Gourmet Magazine?,"I'm not a big fan of horror stories or movies, but with all the buzz about the movie, I decided to pick up this book. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The book gets close to being scary, but unfortunately it constantly retreats back into a laundry list of upscale clothing, art, food, literature and wine. Reading this book didn't make me scared, it just made me want to buy a new tailor made suit, visit an art museum and go out for a gourmet dinner (or better yet, prepare a gourmet dinner). The only real horror in this book was trying to guess what wine Hannibal would choose for his ""gourmet"" cannibal meals. Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs were scary, this is just commercial."
1,Thank God I got this book from the library!,I am so glad I didn't put one red cent in the hands of Thomas Harris for this piece of drivel he probably wrote in one day. I have never been so disappointed in a book. The novel seemed to have been written by a different author about different characters. Where is the strong Starling we all loved and cheered? Where is the creepy Hannibal? Shacked up in South America? I don't think so!!!
1,Disgusting & vile - how about ZERO STARS,"10 year sabbatical for Harris brings nothing forth here. Can't believe how bad it is - serial killer books now are an effort to make the next book even more ""over the edge"" in creative gore. Don't even bother to get this trash at the library (where I did). A waste of time and a crime it was written and published."
2,Madness!,"What happend? Good God, I've been waiting in eager anticipation for this book ever since finishing Silence ( which I believed to be better than Red Dragon, although many disagree with me). The book was simply ludicrous. The stuff with the killer wild boars was laughable...as was Lector unscrewing a skull and eating from it. His relationship with Starling didn't feel right either. The set-up in Europe was nice though."
3,What??,"I was really looking forward to this book. I enjoyed reading it, was swept up in the story early. The parts in Italy were very good. Somewhere in the last third, the story started to go awry. I don't know what the ending was supposed to portray...Clarice Starling was completely out of character. All in all, the book was entertaining, but alas, a little disappointing. I am not looking forward to a movie, afterall."
2,What happened?,"I had waited with baited breath for the sequel of ""The Silence of the Lambs"", Hannibal. After I read it, all I felt was an intense amount of disappointment. What happened? The book had a alot of promise, but that promise went unfulfilled when the book became very sappy and the ending felt contrived and hard to stomach. Great potential, that somehow got lost in the shuffle to get the book on the market."
2,Prepare to have your high hopes shot down,"The last 40-50 pages ruined this book. While 'Hannibal' did not have the magic of the previous two books, it was entertaining...until the ending. Harris destroyed two wonderful characters by having them become something they are not. I was so furious after reading the ending that I threw the book across the room."
4,Great? No. But still very good!,"While it doesn't live up to Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal is a very good novel for those of us who like reading about demented serial killers. In fact, one could argue that Hannibal would work better as a stand-alone piece than the third installment behind RD and SOL. Mr. Harris, another commercially successful Mississippi born writer, raised the bar impossibly high with his first two efforts. Anything less than brilliant and starkly terrifying, alas, Hannibal is neither, would be a disappointment. Not only was it merely very good, versus great, real Lector fans, like me, will object to the direction he takes as a highly cultured fugitive after all these years as a psychopathic cannibal. Despite the negative reviews, I enjoyed Hannibal and would recommend it to readers of this genre."
1,Harris lets go a Hannibal ham,"This book is so bad it makes me never want to read anything ever again. The writing is at the level of an only mildly witty third grader, the plot is clunky, to say the least, the jokes unfunny, the horror un-horrendous, and the end feeling is one of distance, complacency. If Harris's taste for olla podria really had kicked in, we might have a cultural curio on our hands. Instead what we have is a mean, insulting, biggoted, racist, homophobic book that might as well have been written by a computer. Word is that Harris has been writing HANNIBAL for the last ten years. Hey, come on, Tommy, more like TEN DAYS! The best thing about this book is the acknowledgements page, which reads like Nancy Drew on acid. Next time, Tommy Harris, maybe you can write your own book, do your own research, your own cooking. Oh, and the second best thing about this book is that, at least for now, it won't be made into a movie. But then again, if it is, the movie will be infinitely better."
1,Absolutely Awful (not because of the gore and violence),"First of all, let me say that if it were possible, I would have given this book no stars. Maybe I was influenced by the Silence of the Lambs movie,but I just can't believe that the characters in this book would do the things they did. I can understand Starling having some sympathy for Dr. Lecter, however, what she did at the end of the book was absolutely out of character for her in my opinion."
3,Take it for what it's worth,"I was so disappointed with the ending! Agent Starling eating brains? Come on. Mr. Harris made her into a nut case at the end. She's portrayed as strong and independent through The Silence of the Lambs and most of Hannibal and then-Wham! It was so unbelievable. From her rescue in the barn to the opera at the end, the book kind of went off onto another plane."
2,"Read in one day, no trouble sleeping.","I read the reviews and thought it must be fabulous. I love a good scare. Stephen King read it, gave it a good review. How could it be a loser. Please. Totally disappointing. Ending was unbelievable. Somehow didn't understand why Barney gave Margot the rape kit and don't care enough now that I've completed the book to go back and re-read that chapter. Terribly disappointing ending. Had it figured out pretty soon after the final scene at the farm. I spent the entire day reading it on Saturday, finished 3 am. I should have done housework and gone to bed early. OH, as for needing a nightlight to be able to overcome the terror. Gee... If this book is considered scarey, then Godzilla movies must be terrifying...."
5,Juggernaut of All Books,"Thomas Harris' Hannibal is one of the best books I have read lately. I also am amazed by the horribly negative reviews this book has gotten. I read Hannibal first, and then its predecessors, Red Dragon, and Silence of the Lambs. I found that Hannibal held itself on a much higher plane than the first two books. The first book contained parts that seemed to be included simply for their shock factor. While the second book had less random macabre, it still held no comparison to the Olympus of all books, Hannibal. Albeit, I am not very fond of the way Thomas Harris ended his masterpiece. In the way Thomas Harris ends the book, he doesn't allow a fourth sequel to be written. I mean its possible, anything is possible, but the ending leaves a very awkward entrance into any form of a fourth book. In conclusion, Hannibal is a wonderfully brutal book, leading up to, in my opinion, the end of the Hannibal Lecter series.-"" Garden variety manic depressive. Tedious...Very tedious. """
3,A good book with a disappointing ending,"I have not yet read Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon, but I do plan to in the near future, hoping they end better than this one! It started out as a terrific book, with thrills, suspense, and twists. I wish I could tell you what happens at the end just so you won't read the book. It just doesn't make sense and is not realistic. Everyone is hoping for the book to end one way, but......"
5,The Hannibal Lecter Legacy of Evil,"After reading Red Dragon, there is no reason to believe that Harris' next book will not follow suit. You MUST read Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs first though!"
2,Very Disappointing,I am so disappointed by the direction that this story went. The book disgusted me and showed very little of the skill and craftmenship that Harris had in the past 2 Lecter novels. I hope that Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins stay miles away from this one. This book is not worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs.
1,It simply is 'not' believable.,"Unfortunately, for the readers who have waited years for a second look at the infamous Dr. Lecter, there is only a glimpse in 'HANNIBAL'. The book is well written and keeps your interest, but not with the flare of its predecessor. What was good in 'SILENCE OF THE LAMBS', is now evil, and what was evil, is so still."
1,A dud!,Very disappointing sequal to The Silence of the Lambs. Paper cutout characters. No suspense. A totally ridiculous ending. Don't waste your money!
1,Who really wrote this book!?!,"Incredibly dissapointed. I loved the book Silence of the Lambs. Remember when they hired another writer to do a sequel for Gone With the Wind - this had the same feel - that someone else was tinkering with my favorite charachters. Clarice is a totally different person in this book, and the back story on Hannibal was not only LAME but it ruined him for me. Why give away the goods - Hannibal is much better as an enigma.Wouldn't reccomend it to anyone - especially Jodi Foster!"
1,Sigh...,Enough said by other Amazon reviewers. Just wanted to make sure other people save time and $.
2,Essentially Flawed Book,"My main problem with the story is that the characters here bear little resemblance to the characters in the previous book in the beginning, and become even more strange as the book progresses. The ending is just bizarre. Had I not read The Silence of the Lambs, I may have enjoyed this book for what it is, a simple, though grotesque, description of one psychopath and the people he's contacted. However, in the framework of the previous book, this story becomes stupid, contrived, and disappointing. Anyone who'd read the Silence of the Lambs will probably feel the need to read this book; just be prepared for disappointment, and the urge to say ""WHAT??"" at the end."
3,Lack luster continuation of Hannibal Lecteer,The story was chopped into painfull small chapters averaging less than 7 pages that wander.
3,Dissapointing,"I love Thomas Harris's series. I also loved this book, until the end. I felt the book was too gory, even more so than his other books. Don't get me wrong, I love a certain element of gore but this was ridiculous and wasn't warrented. I was extremly dissapointed with the ending and felt that Harris had ruined terrific characters. Read it for what it is, a sequel to Silence. The first one is always the best."
2,not worth listening to,Frankly I found the audio cassette version fairly impossible to listen to and stopped. One's time could be definitely better spent.
2,"Boring, disappointing.","Worth a read for fans, but wait for the paperback or get it at the library. Clarice is a wimp, and for that matter, so is Dr Lecter - he's not really evil, just had a bad experience with his sister (Typical '90s - there's an excuse for everything). Not in the same league as Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs, hard to believe Thomas Harris wrote this."
1,An ending that was an utter disappointment,"If I could, I'd give this book no stars in the ranking. I definately do not recommend reading this book. Hopefully the movie will be better. It can't be worse. I loved Red Dragon and Silence of The Lambs. The respective movies were also very entertaining. I could not wait to get my hands on the latest novel, Hannibal. Thanks to the strength of the first two novels and Hannibal's character, this book was captivating. That is, until the ending. I had a hard time finishing the book. The ending diverged so much from the story and from the characters Harris spent so much time developing. Nonetheless, I held out hope for an exciting ending. What a let down!"
2,"Wanted more, but got less.","After reading Silence and Red Dragon I had expected a thrilling, insightful read. Unfortunately, this is not how I would describe Hannibal. I couldn't wait to be done with this book so I could read something else! The entire book feels forced--Hannibal is stripped of his mystery and nothing very interesting remains. I did enjoy the ending--but it could not make up for the other 200 pages."
3,pageturner at best.,"red dragon still gives me the chills. silence of the lambs was a worthy sequel. this has the feel of an author inspired by contractual obligations in lieu of artistic license. i did finish it quickly, but it leaves no lasting impression other than your average page turner."
1,"A sad dumbing down of intelligent, diabolical Dr. Lecter","This book was a tremendous disappointment. The intelligence of Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs is no where to be found in this tepid, stupid, gory for no reason sequel. Life's too short to waste your time on this one."
5,Raises some interesting questions.,"I think people in general are accustomed to thinking of morality in ""purely good versus purely evil"" terms. Whether he intended to or not, Harris totally skewers this worldview. Dr. Lecter is a monster, yes, but he's a monster for a reason. And in Hannibal you'll find out what that reason is.""Anger presents as lust, lupus presents as hives,"" said Dr. Lecter in Silence, and grief and horror present as murderous behavior. And can it be, at the end of Hannibal, that such a simple cure is possible for such a longtime affliction? Some of you might not think so. Perhaps even Harris was amazed at himself for writing such a thing. But as he said, sometimes you just have to let your characters go and do what they will, according to their own natures.Moral absolutists, people lacking imagination, and those of simple mind will not ""get"" or enjoy Hannibal. As for the rest of you, if you haven't already, I'd skip the movie and get the book."
3,Slow mover.,"While the two books leading up to this one moved quickly and were page turners, I found that I had no problem putting this book down. The storyline seems scattered--as though the author felt it was ""time"" to write the sequel instead of writing it from his passion of needing to tell a story. Disappointing."
4,Superb,"Gauging from other's critiques, I feel the way to most appreicate this book is to have not read the first (""Red Dragon"") and only seen the movie (""Silence of the Lambs""). I fell into this group, and found Harris' novel to be an exquisite contuation of the Hannibal Lecter story. Harris does a superb job of sensually describing Italy from an intelectual's viewpoint.A true mystery fan will find this novel climatic. Someone who appreciates the finer things in life will want more. Someone expecting a continuation of Harris' first Lecter novel may be disappointed - but truly this is a much better read."
2,A beautifully written fizzer,"I have mixed emotions about this book. The fact I couldn't put it down meant it must have had some sort of resonant effect on me. However, the ending left me feeling completely deflated. It was as if the tight storyline had been torn apart like a rope suddenly breaking at its weakest point. All that was left were frayed edges and limp threads. Oh yes, in Australia we do not have quarters, the nearest value currency being twenty cents. I found that particularly disappointing as I took all of the Florentine detail on face value."
3,"Hannibal, what were you thinking?","I am, a great fan of both Red Dragon and Silence of the lambs, but in Hannibal Harris leaves logic behind and writes about a Clarice Starling that seems unbelievable and somewhat ridiculous...wait til the ending. I couldn't put Silence down, I kept putting Hannibal down too many times."
3,Unfortunate Disappointment,"A great book with a weak ending. The ending isn't even believable, and really leaves the series with a sour note (the outcome is too fairy-tail-ish). I did love the book, but I believe this to be more anticipation than a great read. After ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Red Dragon"", this book is an unfortunate disappointment. Read this book, for sure, but don't get your hopes _too_ high."
1,A Very Disappointing Effort for 10 Long Years of Writing!,"Don't bother buying this book if you liked the other Thomas Harris books. It is not even remotely like his others. The creative juices must have dried up! It has a few moments of clarity, but was largely muddled and confused! The ending is the absolute worst I have ever read. It will need a lot of work to make it on the big screen!"
1,"Can I get an ending, please?","Harris falls prey to the Grisham school of writing: compile 500 pages of build up and then just throw in an ending, knowing all the while that a screenplay writer will put more effort towards creating a palatable ending.As evidenced by this very disapointing work, Harris just took the money and ran. The only good news, paperbacks are cheap..."
1,horrible,"I cannot remember ever being so disappointed by a sequel. I enjoyed Red Dragon and Silence so much and this was just awful. I feel that Mr. Harris did not remain true to his characters, especially Clarice. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
3,"if you're a fan, you won't like where it goes","Having read ""Silence of the Lambs"" I was eager to see the movie, and was not disappointed. Consequently I read ""Hannibal"" with images of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster in my mind. Mr Lechter is explored and his skills are clearly demonstrated. I diud not feel the same for Agent Starling, who seemed to lose her self-worth and my interest. Mr Harris seems to have lost interest in the characters that made him rich."
5,Wonderfully and genuinely disturbing,"Well, what can I say? I bought it on the way home from work June 8 and finished it by eleven that night. I could do without the Florentine travelogue section, but by and large I felt replete. The prose has taken on a new looseness and sinuosity. The ending is a shocker with psychological infrastructure to legitimize it. It is genuinely, deliciously disturbing. Reading the bad reviews of this book make me aware of how we have changed since the 1970s, the decade from which I get my basic mindset -- there are a bunch of squeamish, political-correctness-shackled souls out there. This book may not be for them, but I am sent by it."
2,10 yrs in the making and needs another 10,"Harris takes his time in a novel to get it write. Deep, dark, strange, his previous novels were ""all nighters"", difficult to put down. On Hannibal, the money got to him. Pressure from editors and big money from movie producers. He has his price. The 1st half is absorbing. The 2nd half was a quick write. Logically not connected. Characters manipulated for a screen play versus a good novel. The money got impatient and Harris got sloppy and pleasing. The result, a unbelievable, illogical mess that could use a good rewrite before the movie."
2,EWWWWW!,"This book got increasingly repulsive, both in terms of content and of style. Harris's skills have become a parody of themselves as he indulges in every kind of flowery speech. And there's not one likeable character here, especially poor Clarice Starling. The ending of the book is thoroughly disgusting and almost painful.Do not read this. Wait for the movie, as a lot of what happens, like the first time around, will be cut out."
4,Hannibal - Tamed at Last,"So it seems all Dr. Lechter really needed all this time was alittle fun. I must say I was amazed at the ending. However, it has done more to make me think about this book and the psychology behind the characters than a traditional; ending would have. Unbelievable? Yes. Entertaining? Yes"
3,Very disappointing,It seemed that Thomas Harris was forced to write this book. There is none of the brilliance of his previous books. I can't believe Anthony Hopkins has aggreed to play Dr. Lector again. ....
3,"Good as a stand alone, but a sequel it was not","It's ashame that we must judge this book off the premise of it's predecessor. Silence of the Lambs was outstanding - and so was this one up to a point. That is always the problem with a sequel. It must live up to what it followed. Hannibal was a good read and wonderful book in of itself, as Mr HARRIS is more than capable of rendering to us. However, I was very disappointed by STARLING's character. She started out so strong in this, even more so by comparison over Silence of the Lambs. I was able to see how she evolved and matured. This caused me to not only be shocked by the ending, but also very disappointed. Furthermore, I found the end a bit unbelieveable."
1,Can I get my money back?,"Thomas Harris must have been committed to write this book, because he certainly didn't appear to want to do it. I haven't been so sincerely disappointed in a book in a very long time."
1,Did Harris forget his previous characters?,"At the audiobook store, the clerk convinced me to rent the unabridged version of ""Hannibal"" instead of the abridged. Boy, was I fooled! Harris has the disease of all researchers: I must write and publish every little thing I learned while researching and writing this book. Way too long in places but that's not the worst of it. The ending abandoned the characterizations of Starling and Hannibal set forth from ""Silence."" It's no wonder Jodie Foster does not want to play the part: I would not either and I don't blame her. If you still want to read this book, get the abridged tape. It'll save you some time."
2,Hannibal best thriller ever NOT,"This book is dull and boring i mean what sort of book has 103 chapters i got up to 60 something and then quit, it was so repeditive it kept on going over the same issues it probably would have been a lot better if he would have ripped out about 50 chapters. No thank you sorry"
2,Slightly Disappointed,"I consider this book to be confusing. Too many new characters I can't relate with, maybe because I did not read Silence of the Lambs, I saw the movie. I have had to go back to re-read chapters because I am lost. The book has gore it's just not what I expected. I am very diappointed. I was expecting more. I would not recommend this read to anyone."
3,Should be a great movie,Enjoyable. The book didn't sweep me away necessarily but it did hold my interest. I'm looking forward to the movie.
4,Great addition to a Hogwarts costume,"I bought both this scarf and tie made by Elope for a Halloween costume. My main objectives were that it had to be adult-size and some of the reviews had mentioned that it smelled a bit weird but I found these comments to be unfounded. I think it's hard to find the right Hogwarts house scarf because several sellers use the same product images, but then the stated dimensions of the product are different, sometimes by quite a lot. I can confirm that this is the right size for a grown-up. It isn't massive but it's a much nicer, more realistic colour than the scarves I saw on the official theme park website, plus the shipping charges to the UK are much more affordable."
1,two decent cuts,You already know the two good cuts - theyre the singles and fully worth downloading. the rest of the album is disappointing.in the mid 90s timbaland sounded fresh - had a new style - and was known for his creative beats. you would never know that from this new cd. theres nothing remarkable about the beats - the melodies dominate. do we buy timbaland albums for the melodies? i dont think so.timbaland isnt trying to impress anyone - and when artists arent hungry and have no one to impress they slack off and make lame albums like this.
3,Shocked at shock value,"Now, I'm not going to say I didn't like the album. I did like it. But, I just do not feel Timbaland let loose enough.I think he is a wild stallion, but it just felt like something was pulling back on the reins, something was MISSING.I can't put my finger on it, but felt this album was...Too controlled to offer an SHOCK to me.I wanted a cut loose RAW BEAT album.I was satisfied, but being satisfied means the content was just satisfactory. I want to be satiated. I hope another album is to follow this, I really do. I'm addicted to the beats, Timbaland is EXCELLENT for those. I can't get enough. BUT, please next time don't just shock me.I want shock waves, electricty to the veins. Maybe next time."
3,just ok.,"The beats were pretty good, but that's what you expect from Timbaland. The lyrics could have used more work. The album was just ok. It's not going to be in my rotation."
5,Wonderful Game,I ordered this game for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! She has a couple of the Harvest Moon games and wanted to add this one to her collection.
