1,Know what you are buying....,"Just awful.... sorry. This was my first Jeff Beck cd. I was expecting to hear some great guitar tone and amazing riffs, and interesting hard rock guitar-related music. What I actually got was not identifiable as music in any traditional sense, certainly no identifyable guitar music. Instead, a way out pyro-technic auditory ""junkyard"" ....a series of irritating sonic trainwrecks producing an instant throbbing headache and sensations of a sound mixing board being eaten by giant guitar-wielding nuclear rats with blazing red eyes. But that's what I get for not advance-listening to some ""sound bytes"" first."
2,Is The King Dead Or Just Dazed And Confused?,"Once again, Jeff Beck, who I used to think was, ""Guitar GOD"", has traded in melody for FX, tricks and weirdness. We all know he doesn't need the money and he'd rather be working on cars...but if he's going to put his name on something you'd think he'd be worried about looking himself in the mirror everyday.This latest effort is only slightly better than, Flash, which was a diaster. Jeff used to be an innovator but now he seems to be a follower doing whatever his record label tells him they ""think"" will make them money.Hey Jeff, listen to Blow by Blow and Wired, and then WAKE UP!"
5,Totally Kicks,"Jeff Beck's You Had it Coming really kicks. This album proves that Jeff is indeed the greatest guitarist ever. Nadia is perhaps the best song on the album, and is one of Jeff's greatest. Suspension is mysterious and soulfull, a great listen. Dirty Mind is funky and shows Jeff's playing and control quite well. Loose Cannon is utterly awesome, as well as Left Hook. Listen to the fade out on Left Hook, it'll leave you sweating.Jeff's soloing is totally AWESOME on this album. Earthquake, Roy's Toy, Dirty Mind, Loose Cannon, Left Hook...they all have awesome solos and portay Jeff's one of a kind phrasing. Nadia is practically a solo in itself! Jeff's tone is massive and soulfull, YHIC is not to be missed.This album really rocks. It's a great companion to Blow by Blow, Wired, and Guitar Shop."
3,Great disc cut WAY TOO SHORT,"I take issue with only 36 min worth of music. You'd think that the artist and label would do a better job towards providing value. that said, Jeff does what he does best, which is search for a unique sound with every pick."
5,Dirty Mind and Rollin' and Tumblin',"I love this CD (almost said ""album""--shows how long I have been around.) I play it when I want to get ""revved up."" I love Jeff Beck, in my top ten guitarists.Glad the ""older guys"" are still producing and don't let the very stupid idea that they are too old to be Rock and Rolling interfere with their vast creativity.They have become masters of their craft, and I feel blessed to hear what Beck and others are doing.Enjoy!!"
2,Failed to protect equipment,"Con: The APC Protect Net failed to protect my equipment from a powerful surge caused by lightning. APC warranty covers the unit itself, but none of the ""Protected"" equipment. The D-Link Router, 2 D- Link network switches, and not completly sure about all the rest of my network until the router is replaced.Pros: The surge did ""Blow"" the APC Protect net, and the surge damage seems to be limited. APC is sending a new replacement for the APC Protect Net. The AT@T junction box 5 feet outside the room was exploded into pieces from the surge. My computers seem unaffected."
5,Worked against electrical storm already,Amazon had it here in no time. To install was a breeze. Directions clear and concise. Only two days after installation - it proved that it actually did what it perported to do. Saved my router and peripherals from frying.
4,Fun twist on a fun game,Spicy Farkel is a fun twist on Farkle. There is 1 red side on each dice with 1 red of each number between the 6 dice. If you have one of the red sides as part of your scoring roll the points double. It is a fun game with some crazy high rolls. We have actually colored in the dice for our regular Farkle dice so we can play with these rules if we would like. You can use this set to play both traditional Farkle or Spicy Farkel. Fun game to play in a casual setting and varied level of gamers.

2,"Skip this, buy the Beckett Almanac","Aside from being around $10 cheaper, there is absolutely no reason for this book to exist anymore. It's like Beckett is just trying to sum up the cards that moved during a given year, rather than producing a comprehensive price guide. If you want a comprehensive guide, you have to go with the much more complete Beckett Almanac, that is also produced every year, or the Standard Catalog of Baseball Cards from Krause Publications.Don't waste money on the Beckett Price Guide."
1,Literature for Beginners,"I have never read one of Keyes's books, and would likley not do so after reading ""Sushi for Beginners."" The story was unimaginative and very predictable, and the characters one-dimensional. It wasn't until I was almost through with this book that I actually began to care in the slightest about a couple of the characters. In addition, the narrative was riddled with tired and often silly cliches (ie, comparing the fluidity of someone's dancing to a sack full of puppies!), and the dialogue was uninteresting. Would not reccomend,unless you're looking for a sleep aid!"
3,Hard To Get Into.,"This was a very very hard book to get into. It took me until I was of the way through before I actually wanted to read it. I can imagine that someone with less patience than I would have a hard time! This is a funny story of a workaholic British woman who moves to Ireland to start up a new glossy magazine. Her marriage has fallen on its face and she is working to get on top of the publishing world. Meanwhile you meet two other women with men issues and career problems. Ashling, one of the other main characters, is known as miss-fix-it. She has spent a lifetime trying to deal with her mother's depression and lack of parenting. The last 40 pages of this book make the whole thing worth reading. It is a fun summer read that will keep you just entertained enough to finish (if you can get into it in the first place)."
3,Sushi for Beginners,"Not bad, really. A little slow in the beginning, but picks up as it goes along. Neither as hilarious and pointed as Rachel's Holiday nor as poignant as Last Chance Saloon, but good nevertheless."
3,Not my fave Keyes novel,"I had a high level of expectation for this novel. After reading Last Chance Saloon and Watermelon, I could barely wait for Sushi for Beginners to come out. Unfortunately it did not live up to the standards of Mrs. Keyes' other novels. The book is written about the same topic as most 'chick lits' of late. There is the 'good' heroine & the 'bad' heroine, who consequently both work together at a fashion magazine. Big Shocker There! Although the author's writing is excellent, I found myself bored and laboring to get through the novel. If you're a die-hard Keyes fan you will undoubtedly like Sushi for Beginners, but if you're not, I STRONGLY urge you to read the witty Last Chance Saloon instead. It's brilliant."
1,Could not get through it,"With all the positive reviews and press this book got, I feel like I'm missing something because I could not finish this book (and I finish 98% of the books I read). Now that I've read a few of the reviews, I see that other people noted the slow first half. And boy, was it slow. I got about 40% of the way through before stopping. I didn't like any of the characters: Lisa was bitchy, Clodagh complained too much, and Ashling was too goody-goody. I also couldn't sympathize with their so-called problems -- I didn't have a reason to care. The combination of ""meh"" characters and slow pacing made this book a DNF for me. Maybe other Marian Keyes books are better, so I'll keep looking."
2,Not Keyes Best Novel,"It took me one month to get through this book. My average time to finish a book is 3 days - 1 week. Previously, I've enjoyed several of Keyes' novels and enjoy the 'Chick Lit' genre, but I was so disappointed by this one, that I threw it out afterward. The characters lack a great deal of depth, which unfortunately created indifference toward the characters. The characters of Lisa and Clodagh are so shallow, that it's difficult to find emmpathy for them. In contrast, Ashling is uber-naive and sugary sweet to the point of annoyance. The pace of the book is too slow and monotonous. However, the final third of the book, finally picked up and was somewhat enjoyable. I think this may have been better off as a short story."
2,"Slow, slow, slow.","Not until the final 50 pages of the book does the reader find out what the title means -- and not until slightly before that does the story really take off.I'm a fan of Keyes, listing Watermelon, Rachel's Holiday, and Last Chance Saloon as some of the brightest titles in the Chick Lit universe. But this book was so slow, so sleepy, that it took me nearly a month to read it.Pick it up if you've read all her other books and can't wait for a new title. All in all, it's not vintage Keyes. But you could do a lot worse."
4,After Angels...Keyes Came Back!,"After reading ""Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married,"" I immediately ran to the store and bought ""Rachel's Holiday."" I fell so in love with Keyes writing that I literally had to force myself not to read all her book's in a row so that I would have something to look forward to...Having been very bored and disappointed with ""Angels,"" I was thrilled with the return of Keyes' unique style in ""Sushi for Beginners."" Fun, charming and witty. Still not my favorite of all her books, but wonderful all the same."
3,It Got me throgh my long Thanksgiving Week...,"..but that's about all I can say about it. It started off great and steadily went downhill from there. I would actually give this a 3 1/2 but that's not an option. It has potential and a few good points after the fall from the great beginning. I kept expecting more and I was disappointed when there was nothing finished. Who the heck knows how anyone truly ended up. There are hints, but no finishes."
3,rare pieces worth exploring,"Both the Orchestra and the conductor do not seem at their best here, but Tchaikovsky is Tchaikovsky and worth attention even in his less famous piece as it is the case here. Worth going for it, the price is also inviting, no regret at the end."
3,"Good fun, however dated it feels.","This is my first ebook, bought out of whim on a long, boring day when the bookstore is three hours drive away from where I was. It's a readable thing. It is, also, very dated in feel.It is also unfortunate the author uses every cliche in the book - evil other woman, big misunderstandings, and stock characters. The heroine is headstrong and ninny to the point of bullheadedness sometimes.But having said that, I did enjoy the story. It's pleasant. My friend told me this is the author's first book. If so, I think I'll try another book of hers."
5,Great pad,"This pad is great, it's not too thick, but the foam is dense enough to take the bite out of the barbell when squatting. Because it's not very thick, you can keep the bar close to your body where it should be."
2,Manual of Wigmaking,"For those of you who are familiar with wigmaking, this book may be a helpful resource to you in your wigmaking. For those of you who are as clueless as I am and want to start into wig making, good luck with this one."
3,Perfect,I like to be on top of everything when it comes to my childrens education gave me some ideas on what to ask and let the teacher know who I am and what I am about!
1,weak,"I found this to be weak, the clamp flexes, and the pole bends under the weight of the Foredom rotary tool. Nice for temporary work like a pic nick bench when camping, but not for regular use."
5,Great for toddlers and primary school children,"This CD activates children to dance and have fun. It is healthy, fun music and good for all ages, especially younger children. There are even some subtle health tips built in. I highly recommend it. Check their website to see them perform in person. They are a great act."
2,"You just can't show ""style"" in black and white","See the 2 images above I uploaded. There are exactly 8 pages of color plates of women's dresses and a couple gentlemen's suits. One the color pages reproduces the front cover so it's a waste. The most divine picture is on the back cover: a close-up of one of the highly-decorated women's gowns. Black & white photographs simply cannot express the grandeur and eloquence of design. The Russian ""style"" is completely lost in it. There is page after page of folk dresses, paintings, portraits, art objects...blah blah...they're just boring. The text must take a second seat to the images and it cannot replace them.Jackie Kennedy Onassis was about as stylish as you can get. And this book was published in 1976 so she somehow got around the Iron Curtain (which is ironic regarding the Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis). Unfortunately, this book has not stood the test of time. I can't recommend it."
5,Best Phrase Book for Phillipines IMHO,can't go wrong with this one on vacation or extended visit orliving there or working in Philipines. A grest starter guideto phrases and pronunciations.
1,I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE,I purchased this book after having seen it shown on a television broadcast and reading all the glowing reviews.I delved into the book with high expectation only to find I quickly tired of her overuse of adjectives (heavy use of a thesauraus).I failed to read more than a couple chapters (having given it a fair chance) and am sorry I had purchased it for my Kindle since I cannot even recoup some of the purchase price.**Note: The Kindle version ratings are much better than the other versions of this book.Check out the paperback and hardback verions to see that there are many others that are in agreement with my opinion.
1,Just bad!!!,I hate writing bad reviews but man this was a bad read! How can you start the book so good in the first 5 pages and not come back to those people till the last 2 pages of the book? Good lord! I will not be wasting another 10$ on this book! If you change the price to 99cents I would take a shot to see where you are going with the story. And 50 5 star reviews... Are you guys for real! If you would like to read some 5 star book PLEASE look at my past reviewed books!!!Sorry Wendy but it was really bad!
5,Enlightening,Great book! good analysis of human behavior and dealing rationally with how to set limits and understand dysfunctional interactions. Highly recommend
4,nice for the price,"got these for applying pastel ground to mat board. works well, price was great. nice and soft. will also be using them for washes."
5,Best beginning gardener's book.,"I was very disappointed to find that this book is no longer in print. It is by far the best book I have found for the beginning gardener. It's descriptions and colors for planning a garden and/or finding a type of flower, plant, or shrub are wonderful. It is a very easy book to follow in searching for what you are looking for."
3,regular book,"Daniel Cecchini explains several major airline desasters, but he does it in a short way. Besides these are very famous accidents and you can get cheaper and better books about them.The only good thing this book has is how it explains the accident of LAPA flight 3142 which crashed at buenos aires 08/31/99 killing 67.I recomend you AIR DISASTERS 1, 2, 3 & 4 BY MacArthur Job."
2,Good Only For Scanning Flat Items ~ No Depth Of Field For 3 Dimensional Items & Only Trial Software,"Good Only For Scanning Flat Items ~ No Depth Of Field For 3 Dimensional Items & Only Trial Software that you will need to pay extra for upgrades ~ if you want to resize your photos, etc. I am disappointed, as I have always used a scanner for items I list on auctions and this scanner is not really serving my purpose appropriately. I had a Hewlett Packard scanner that worked great for many years, but because I now have a computer with Windows Vista, it would not recognize my scanner because it was more than eight years old. So much for Vista ~ not too happy with that either. Live and learn. Now I see why so many people complain about the new windows vista. UPDATE: Scanner malfunctioned and Canon offered great customer service and a replacement at no charge to me!!!!!"
4,Good value,"I searched the internet high and low to find something inexpensive that would do what I wanted without taking forever for each picture to scan. This one is a bit noisy, somewhat slow, but the nice feature is being able to put multiple pictures into it and have them scan all at once. Once I figured that out, this thing is a breeze. I agree that newsprint is not the highest quality for scanning, but doing both black and white and color photos was very acceptable."
4,Great Buy,"I am very satisfied with this scanner, it's a little slow but for as much as I use it, its great. If you don't need to do a great amount scanning (because of the speed) this is the scanner to buy. This is the third scanner that I have bought over the years, my others (Microtek & HP) while more costly really didn't offer much more than the Canon."
4,"great images, a little slow","This scanner works well in both windows and linux. It's a bit slow, but makes nice images."
3,just Portable and nothing more,Merits:1)Portable2)No external Power chordDe-Merits:1) Slow Operation2) Scans only A4 Size3) Little Pricey for just scanning..For me it just serves the purpose.I would give it 3.5 out of 5.ThanksMahesh
3,Scan this Miserable Experience,"I'm a big fan of Canon products in general however this product really is making me rethink things. It gives decent image quality but is very noisy, slow, and causes strange computer issues. It draws so much power through it's USB cable that I have to unplug it from my computer before I boot up or else it will take an extra 10 minutes! I am not able to even use it with my USB hub because it draws more power than my total hub supports (which is ridiculous because I have no problem when the camera, card reader and mp3 player are simultaneously plugged into the hub and being used). I didn't find the software to be an issue. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. There are a lot of bundled products though and it may take a moment to read and follow instructions. A few years ago I got a free no-name scanner when I signed up for ISP service and I'd take it back over the Canon LiDE 25 in a heartbeat if only the software would run on XP."
4,Canon CanoScan LiDE 25 -- is a good buy,"Pros: Compact footprint on desktop, USB powered, inexpensive, works well, good valueCons: Somewhat noisy on startup, not as high res as some very high-end units.My old Visioneer 4400 USB died, so I was forced to get a new scanner. I did not want to get an all-in-one unit as I already had a decent printer and no phone line for a fax. I see no need for the average small business owner or home user needing an expensive high end unit when this scanner does a lot for the dollar. The CanoScan LiDE 25 is a good value for your dollar. The color accuracy seems to be good, and the scanner integrated well with my existing Paperport software I was using. I would recommend this scanner for anyone needing a good value scanner for light/medium use without a document feeder."
2,Adequate but not Windows 98 compatible,"I bought at a retail store. With a salesman I checked the Canon website. The site and this add said Windows 98 compatible. My UMax 1200 scsi died and the Win 98 system it is on will have to updated eventually, but I thought this would fit the bill til then. After many emails back and forth to the company, turns out it is compatible starting w/ Windows 98SE, not Windows 98. The company was very responsive. I've loaded on my laptop w/ Win Me in the meantime. If you have a lot of items to scan, you may want to look elsewhere as this is pretty slow. The quality is adequate, color resolution greater than 300 dpi slows it down. If just an occassional scanner its ok. Does auto-cropping that my old astra couldn't do."
3,CanoScan LiDE 25 Scanner,"Nice design. Plus points: Ultra slim, needs no external power, good software. Only disadvantage: Rather slow, taking around a minute to scan a page."
5,A great buy!,"I did a lot of research on Amazon when I decided to get a scanner. I read many, many reviews and finally picked this one. I'm very happy with it, I'm glad to say. I use it primarily to increase or decrease pictures so that I can trace them onto my quilt tops- very user friendly in that area anyway. I can even get fat books to scan!! :0) Thanks, I'm very pleased with this scanner!"
4,pretty good!,"this is a good little scanner. very light-weight and pretty simple to operate, although it took us a while to figure it out. it's nothing fancy, but if you don't need super high-quality or don't use a scanner all the time, it serves its purpose well. we were pleased with the price as well."
4,"Fast, good little scanner","This scanner is a really good deal for the money. My previous scanner was a 3-in-1 printer combo, and that was super slow and the software was useless. The software that comes with the LiDE 25 is very useful in tweaking the image before you scan (although sometimes it's just easier to scan it in and tweak with Photoshop). Also, it auto crops the image, finding where the image is on the page you are scanning. Very helpful! The software will also help you stitch documents together if they are too large for the plate. Colors are bright and crisp.The only issue I had (thus giving it 4 instead of 5 stars) was that it was a bit difficult to get to work with Windows Vista, despite the apparent support for that OS. I had to delete a registry key relating to a Logitech web camera for some reason, but then it worked."
1,Canon CanoScan LiDE 25 disappoints,"I purchased and promptly returned a CanoScan LiDE 25. I was seeking only a basic scanner of good quality that would be relatively simple to operate. This item is low in the Canon line but I guess I assumed the name Canon would assure a high level of quality nevertheless. I was disappointed. The LiDE 25 is a very light weight unit - literally. It is almost toy-like in its construction and it's capabilities - it produced below par scans for me. I was replacing a mid-line Epson 1670 but the Canon was in an entirely different league and in my opinion is just not a good investment when you realize for a few more dollars you can have one of several other ""real"" scanners. Not recommended."
5,"Good, light weight, portable scanner!","I bought 3 of these because they are light weight, easy to pack, and scan quite well for class/office/on-the-fly!I plan on using my new one with my laptop for class. I can easily store it & hide it so you don't even know it's there. Hide it, you say? Yes! Because it stores between books & things in an upright position if necessary. And if hidden properly, people won't 'borrow' it & forget to give it back. This way, I don't have to hunt one down at work/school to use. It fits in most backpacks and it's a good scan for what you need. Fits easily in a 10x13 padded envelope or bigger. This way it will be overlooked and safe from prying hands & busy minds!! LOL!!Definitely makes a good gift & the price is right. I put this on my Gift List of things I don't have to think about. I can just buy it & know it won't end up regifted, in the trash, or the Salvation Army bin!!It's a keeper! Buy this you'll like it & you won't give it away!!"
4,Happy Customer,"All in all a great product. I have a 2009 Dodge Challenger SRT8 and did research on a lot of different Air Intakes, and settled on the K&N. It was reasonably priced and claimed horse power gains as well as fuel economy gains. Received the product in great shape, installed in about an hour, instructions were a little confussing but managed to work it out. The tube is just hard plastic, not the flashy chrome, or aluminum but I didn't want the flash. Before installing it I got about 18 - 19 m/gl on the high (drive about 50miles oneway to work) after the install I got about 21 so it did help. Couldn't really feel the horse power in the lower gears and RPM ranges but definately felt a little boost in the 3rd and 4th in the 5k rpm range. So again, a decent product, would have given it 5 stars if the instructions were a little better and the tube wasn't just plastic."
5,really do work,"i purchased this almost a year now and i am still surprised that the performance of this filter still works. i love the way it sounds also. but make sure you remove the bottom air box thingy on chrysler 300c 5.7, it will allow more air and sound alot better without it"
1,Cold Creek Manor,"This is not just a bad movie, its an awful movie. Generally, I overlook technical flaws in a movie as long as I'm entertained but this one has so many flaws, and is so lacking in entertainment value, that I can't resist. Screenplay - awful. Cinematography - awful. Sound editing - awful. Acting - dissapointing. I've seen better production values in some straight-to-video releases.I particularly like how there is a chase through the darkened mansion and all of a sudden a light shines upon the protaganists so that we can see them.I like Dennis Quaid but this is a performance he should hope to soon forget. Sharon Stone is showing her age and not aging gracefully. The actor who plays the bad guy does a bad Billy Zane imitation. If you want a great movie about a psycho, rent or buy Dead Calm.T"
2,"A big, lavish thriller... about a creepy neighbor guy?","I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that, due to nice production values, fine acting, and a skillful directing job, this movie is worth seeing. You can decide yourself whether that means a purchase or a rental. But after seeing ""Cold Creek Manor"", I think you'll probably agree with me that the whole affair is basically, in the end, much ado about nothing. What we ultimately have here is an expensive, lavishly produced film about an annoying neighbor. That's it. Yes, the neighbor gets somewhat more dangerous as the film progresses, and there's a bit of a mystery about his past- and admittedly more serious- misdeeds, but ultimately they made a whole movie about the kind of disorderly conduct / nuisance neighbor case that most middle class neighborhoods have to put up with from time to time. I guess the producers felt it was high time that all those creepy, ex-con, handyman types out there finally got their own film."
1,Left me cold!,"I hate to even give it one star because it's so dreadful. But the performances of the supporting actors-Juilette Lewis and Stephen Dorf are superb all the more so in contrast to the two leads-Sharon Stone and Dennis Quaid. I'll save you the lenghty detailed account of the plot you read in other reviews mainly because I don't want to relive it myself let alone relate it. Ms. Stone gives her worst performance to date, and Mr. Quiad is simpering in a role that requires strength. Sharon has no maternal repore with the boy and girl playing her children, and you are painfully aware that they are ""acting"" the part of a family. The plot also has holes big enough to drive a truck through and in the end you're left with more sympathy for the bad guy than the family. This movie is so self aware it is almost comical. Every one of the main characters lacks the charisma to engage you. You find yourself simply not caring about the fate of the family, and on the edge of your seat awaiting the credits."
1,Dreck,"If you like films with very poor acting, an extreamly weak script, and colosally stupid characters making stupid decisions then this is your kind of movie. Everyone else, stay away from this dreck."
3,It's okay. Not really that good.,"At least it was an effort. Not to scary. I laughed more than I jumped. Most of it is predictable. TOO predictable. But I'm a jaded horror fan. So my oppinion doesn't matter. I know all the tricks. I'm not just saying that either, the only reason I know all the tricks is because I've seen basically all of them. So if you're not an avid horror film watcher, then I suggest you see it."
4,I LIKED IT!,"I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS ABOUT THIS MOVIE BUT, SO MANY OF THE MOVIES QUOTES HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH MY HEAD. ""I'M GONNA BASH YOUR SKULL IN, AND THROW YOU DOWN THE DEVILS THROAT"" I KNOW I SOUND LIKE A MORON. AND HEY THIS IS FAR CRY FROM BEING SOME COMPLICATED MOVIE THRILLER BUT, I REALLY DID DIG THIS MOVIE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS COMPLETELY UBSURD. DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE WATCH IT AND THEN WAIT ABOUT A WEEK AND WATCH IT AGAIN."
4,I didn't think it was that bad!,"I love these kind of movies, and although it wouldn't be up for any Academy Awards, it was a pretty good flick. I am somewhat surprised at most of the more negative reviews of this movie, and many of these were pretty harsh. Overall, it deserves much better than most of these people are saying about it. Check it out and make up your own mind. I read many of these same reviews, and still went out and bought the DVD. I'm not sorry I did, and plan on telling everyone I know about it. I am a huge fan of Dennis Quaid, and I really wanted to like this movie, I guess. Anyhow, it really has some ""tense"" moments, and the last 30 minutes were REALLY intense, I way I like 'em!!"
2,Cold Creek Manor review,"The only thing good about this movie is the actors. I really like Dennis Quaid, Sharon Stone, and Steven dorf did an excellent job in this film. but the whole movie is too long and dragged out. The action doesn't happen until the end. there are a number or jumpy spots in the movie, but they are all little things where you think something will happen then it turns out to be a friend or something silly. The whole movie just goes on and on and doesn't really give much detail until the end. I enjoyed the overall end."
5,Love these...cleans great!,These clean my pump parts great! I use them daily when I have to pump at work. They're quick to use and I only have to use one wipe to clean my double pump. I also like to use them when I'm on the go traveling.
5,Lifesaver,"I'm a student intern and can barely even take the time to pump, much less figure out how to wash the parts afterwards. I only intern twice a week, so one pack has lasted me over a month now. These wipes have given me the ability to continue pumping and not having to stop over 2 days of the week."
1,Misleading photo,"I should have been more observant when ordering this item. While the description, female USB mouse to PS2, is what I received, the photo shows a PS2 to male USB connection-which is what I wanted. The price was such that I probably won't bother to return it."
4,Easy Listening,Nice and easy music to listen to with you sweetie!! No one can sing like him...a must to have to your music collection.
1,Book was not up to its title.,"Being new to using Macromedia products, I found the manual pretty limited. After reading this book I feel I was better off with the manual. It was not the best 25 I have spent. It is very poorly illustrated, the files referred to in the book do not exist on the CD, not well structured. The author presumes prior knowledge of Flash. I feel some more use of screen shots would have done the book more justice. I personally think this book would be ideal for someone who already knows how to use Flash (then why would you buy this book)."
3,Pray All Ways,"I always like this author's work, so bought this assuming I would feel the same about this offering.This is not my favorite; it just doesn't ""do it for me""."
4,Fun Reading,"The Dead Circus is fun reading. Gene Burk, a 40ish ex-LA cop in the mid-eighties, mourning the death of his fiance in a plane crash, decides to solve the one unsolved ""crime"" from his life as a cop that still haunts him--the apparent suicide of Bobby Fuller. Kaye' story is sort of all over the map--jumping from character to character, discussing three events in one short paragraph--but somehow it's not overly confusing. Burk's quest brings him into the warped and bizarre world of Charles Manson. The Dead Circus is an unpredictible story that starts off almost as a standard crime novel and then goes into something unto itself. Enjoy."
1,i really didn't like it that much,i really didn't like it that good it wasn't that enterestering to play there signed; sharon miller
2,meh..,i guess they're ok... i saw the reviews of low clamping pressure and i didnt think it would be a problem... but its a problem...They dont really work for qwhat i need them for but i suppose i'll be able to use them for something
2,Quick-Grip Review,These clamps are my least favorite clamps in my shop. The springs fall out of the handle grip often and need to be replaced (if you can find the darn things). For quick applications they are okay at best. For serious woodworking I recommend paying a few dollars more and get better clamps for your project.
2,"Westclox ""Nova White""","Nice design, but the alarm is *unbelievably* loud and harsh, rendering it basically useless, except for the partially deaf."
3,"Great portability, poor precision","I must admit, I didn't buy this from Amazon. I got mine from Woodworker's Warehouse when they were going out of business. If the sale hadn't been final, I would have returned it. The ability to take this table anywhere is wonderful. And if you don't need pinpoint accuracy from the fence on the job-site, then this table is for you. The large work surface is good. After drilling an extra hole, I was able to mount my PC 7518 underneath. The table itself has allt he basic features of any basic table, but the fence is poorly designed and frankly a pain to adjust. I have used it and will continue to use it in the field, but I will not use it in the shop."
2,Gaudi Needs Some Words,The two-disc set -- Antonia Gaudi -- is truly gorgeous. The slow and elegant tour of Barcelona's Gaudi collection is very satisfying visually. What is missing is any kind of voice-track. I was hoping to discover how he raised the money to build all those art works. What kind of developer would take a chance on him to bring back a profit on a big apartment complex? I also wanted to learn a bit more about his personal biography. I would have to give this one only two stars because it did not meet my personal expectations.
5,Book on Antonio Gaudi,This is an amazingly beautiful and comprehensive book for a very reasonable price!It contains photographs and descriptions of all of Gaudi's works.
4,Gaudi's work speaks for itself.,"The beauty of this film is that there is little dialog. This isn't a biography in the traditional sense, which is what I loved about it. It follows Gaudi's career through the evolution of this architecture. It's a brilliant approach. The Criterion addition also includes a BBC bio, but the host can't see beyond his personal religious upbringing, that is definitely gets in the way of a bio of Gaudi. I have a long time fan of Gaudi, he was one of a kind, his work has never been replicated and he did it on a scale that couldn't happen again. Fascinating."
3,I have mixed feelings about this one...,"I appreciate the fact that it is 'on the go'... Unfortunately, it is a pain to have to boil the warmer before using it. Also, it only fits 4 oz. bottles, 8 oz. bottles stick out of the top! I have found that if I use this product along with a thermal pouch, it will keep a bottle warm for several hours, especially if I use it straight from the boiling water. I do have a problem with it turning itself 'on' by itself before I am ready for it to heat up. The stick that you bend must be pretty sensitive to every bump. In all, it is not a bad product for the money..."
3,Always Faithful- A delighful journey!,"I enjoyed the book because of the amazing details that accompany each episode of the book from the training at Camp Lejeune to the battles at Guam. What really jumps out for the reader is the challenges to train the dogs and the critical role they played in WWII. The war scenes on Guam are realistic and the deaths of the dogs touch the reader's heart. Yet there are triumphs of the spirit as the dog's prove themselves over and over again. There are several humorous scenes that occur during training and at other times in the book that provide a laugh including the several scenes at Camp Pendleton. You find yourself lost in Dr Putney's journey that leaves one turning the pages to ""see what happens next!"" Truely a vital testament to the Marine War Dogs of WWII and those who pay them tribute! Bravo Zulu! A great read!"
5,"A book that appeals to dog lovers and readers of war memoirs, alike","I'm both and found this book to be an excellent example of both genres. Good descriptions of Marine training, dog training and veterinary issues in a combat theater as well as of combat on the Pacific Islands."
5,Romantic Halloween Postcards,"These postcards are really neat! I wanted to tear them out and put them up for Halloween, but I couldn't bear to take the book apart (call it librarian syndrome). The images really got me interested in the history of Halloween and even inspired me to do some vintage looking Halloween crafts. I want to get the book by the same author that explains the significance of the images."
3,Great Gift--but expensive!,Luckily I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daughter-in-law--who loved it! She didn't have to see the price tag. I would not have bought it for myself--but it made a great gift!
1,Don't Buy It!,This Little Gem Isn't All It's Cracked Up To Be.I Bought One About A Year Ago And One Side Of The Pliers Broke Off.They're Made Out Of Pot Metal Or Something So Not Very Tough If That's What You're Looking For.
5,more than 5,Gerber MP800 is the best multitool ever made by man. it's like my American Express never leave home without it and it's so handy my wife wants one. Anyhow i recommend this to everyone and anyone; if they do another MgGyver series he should upgrade to a Gerber 800.Thanks.
5,A true classic and a must-read for any seeker of true love,All I can say about this work is that if you are interested in or are seeking true love in this life then this book should definitely be part of your journey. After you have finished it you will know many of the reasons why I am making this statement. Hemingway wrote the ending 36 times and its power reflects his effort. It smites me to the core at every reading. I will carry what I learned from A Farewell to Arms in my heart forever.
5,Tobaggans,"Any book that features the word ""tobaggan"" eleven times on a single page has my vote for sure."
3,A Great War Book,"A Farewell to Arms is a crude, grainy photograph of American (and European) attitudes at the end of the War. It feels entirely authentic. A pervasive emptiness fills the survivors, who are hollowed out in many ways by their experiences. Despite its quality, however, A Farewell to Arms has little to offer readers except a disillusionment similar to that of its characters."
5,***A MUST READ***,"A must have for any woman's library.I could not put it down!!! Congratulations Ms. Knight on an extraordinary debut novel. The only problem I had with this book is that it came to an end. I am anxiously anticipating ""Kismet Continues."" The realistic characters and action filled chapters filled my head the entire THREE days it took me to read this novel. Impressive writing style,fantastic imagination,great continuity...Thank you Ms. Knight for your contribution to literature!!!!P.S. Thanx mom-in-law for sharing this delightful piece of work!"
5,Vintage Morrissey,"Absolutely wonderful live footage that catches Morrissey looking and singing at his best. Plenty from ""Vauxhall"" with great additions from his beautiful ""World"". A must for any true Morrissey fan."
2,bass,"don't know about the baritone section, but this book is of very little help if you're a bass looking to expand your repertoire or branch out.it mostly just repeats repertoire for every section (ex. ""gia il sole dal gange"" for italian songs, italian concert songs, songs with agile singing...)a lot of arie antiche in here and very basic rep that isn't put together very well"
5,Jackson Mendoza - Venus or Mars,Purely great song from upcoming talent. Contrasts between slow and fast tempos with an excellent video clip giving the song both great audio/visual quality.
4,I have a question,"I have used in my classes the VHS ""Mayas, Aztecs and Incas"" produced by this company many years ago (no date in the VHS), maybe in the early 90s. The video is great because in just 27 minutes, it provides great images and very succint information about these great civilizations. My question is: Is this DVD the same video in a different format? I hope it is. I will appreciate any feedback about this."
1,BEWARE - DO NOT BUY,"TV was received on 2/15/2008 and promptly would not turn on 20 days later - 3/6/2008. Amazon would not help as they used Electronic Express for the sale, so they were worthless. Electronic Express would only help for the first 15 days, so I was left working through Sylvania. Their customer service is far from service. I have now called 4 times with little to zero progress and the TV sits on the floor. The unit will not power on at all. It tries to come on but fails to do so. BEWARE of unit, BEWARE of Electronic Express and BEWARE of buying from Amazon. Go to your local store. It pays in the long run!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11"
1,Beware!,Unit lasted exactly 98 days. Unit now completely inactive. Service repair a joke... they need 3 months to handle the repair.
4,Huge hit with my almost-four year old,"My son just received this set as an early birthday gift. It was an immediate hit. I gave four stars because some of the pieces are a little tough to get together, but what really impressed me is that the directions for each of the models are drawn in such a way that very young children can totally understand them. My son was able to look at each step, determine which pieces he needed and get started assembling, even though he needed a little help. Looks like he has a great future putting together Ikea furniture!"
2,Durable but not a do-it-self toy,"We received this as a gift and had great hopes, but it requires so much force to put the pieces together that neither of my boys (5 and 6) can put together the vehicles alone. One benefit is that they don't fall apart when you drive them down the slide or stairs or off of ramps. My boys tend to use the wheels alone and have developed a bowling-type game with the pieces."
2,Impossible to differentiate between nipple sizes; leaky too...,"I generally like Dr. Brown's bottles, although admittedly they do leak on a consistent basis. But by far the most frustrating aspect of these bottles are the impossible-to-read labels found on the underside of the nipple. My twins alternate between level 1 (for breastmilk), Level 2 (for formula), and the Y cut (for formula thickened with cereal). It is ridiculously difficult to read the transparent raised label on the underside of the nipple, especially when it is a bleary-eyed attempt in the middle of the night.If I didn't get these for free from a friend, I never would have stuck with the brand."
2,Long on fact and short on story-telling,"This would be a great book for someone interested in qualitative information about life in old china. It was well-written and not so uninteresting - but it is not a novel or a story. There was no dialouge and only a little plot, and so it's best for a history person as opposed to someone who likes Pearl Buck or Amy Tan."
4,oil free and works great.,"Works great and very light. Only thing is the nailer doesn't allow you adjust depth if you have the air pressure greater than 90psi. Like if your compressir is hooked up to other tools operating at higher pressure let's say 100 psi, than the senco gun will operate at still the high pressure"
1,Cool Water Small size,"I would have been better off purchasing a larger size, because I didn't realize it was that small I guess."
2,Warning: MINIATURE BOTTLE,"Before you rush to buy this bottle thinking that you are getting a great deal notice that this is a miniature bottle. The price is the same if you get it elsewhere, I checked."
3,Dijon and Basil anyone?,"I didn't think this was a bad book. I just didn't think it was a GREAT cookbook. If you don't like dijon and fresh basil you won't like the majority of the recipes. Which is what I think turned me off on this. However, if you're looking for some new ideas then it has a lot of them. I enjoyed how many variations on sandwiches she had. I also enjoyed many of the desserts and the scone recipe. She has lots of muffin recipes but I'm not big on those either. It's worth a look but I didn't buy it."
1,IT DOESN'T WORK,I wore the Reliefband while flying on a floatplane and lost my breakfast and didn't make it to lunch.
4,Good value but needs some work,"I have had this product for a short period of time and already like that i can add and remove the bags as i need to. I have added the Dewalt tape holder. one thing i wish these bags had would be a place for a pair of pliers. there are plenty of small tool spaces but none are large enough for a pair of pliers. I bought it mainly for the belt b/c i guess most carpenters are fat. its the only one i found that fits a waist smaller then 36"". all in all its a great belt and I will continue to add to it."
3,design issues,"I've had a custom setup for years and am regretting not staying with it. This nylon tool belt puts the hammer at your tailbone where it can knock the backside of your legs while you walk. Uncomfortable at best. I like a chisel and utility knife at my left hand. There's a slot for one, but not two. But most inconvenient is the constant rearrangement of tools to accommodate my nailer, which I'll hang off my belt. Used to have a hammer holder as the first unit to the right and used it to hang the nailer. Very convenient."
5,Versatile Belt,"This belt is great. I've had it for about 6 months and it is has held up perfectly. I use this with the extra drill holder, the tape measure holder, but I only use one of the bags at a time. This works out great since I can keep one setup for framing and another for what ever odd job I'm about to do. This way I have one bag alway setup for what I use the most, but can easily pull it off, and setup one for electrical or anything else."
3,"Okay, but there are better alternatives","This is a good field guide, but there are no color pictures, and the labeling system assumes that you already have a knowledge of the insect families. I bought this for an entomology class, but didn't use it once throughout the semester. I would recommend the Audubon guide (also available on Amazon) as a better alternative."
5,Awesome,"I saw this ova on cartoon network a while back and could never find a copy at my local video stores, so I finally broke down and bought it off of amazon. If you like anime you should really watch this. It's short, it's fun, it's well animated, and the story isn't half bad. It may not be for everyone but it is one of my favorites."
5,how can you be discontented if you can listen to this?,"A great, little known, and long gone but not forgotten band from the eighties out of LA, the Fibonaccis still sound as good today as they did when these tracks were first recorded over 20 years ago, demonstrating how good music stands the test of time. Most of the best tunes here are from their classic album Civilization and its Discotheques, but the listener will also find a number of rarities. Drawing on many influences, and with a particularly Brechtian feel, but still managing to sound totally original, this album is a magnificent entre to the world of the Fibonaccis. After even a single listen, the songs manage to assert an addictive power. No need to single out the good tracks, each one here bears repeated listening"
3,It's a toss up ...,"I purchased the Lidia patterned twin sheet set.Pros:The packaged set is very heavy in weight.You can tell right away these sheets are going to keep you warm.Excellent for the cold winter months. They warm you up veryquickly. I even use the flat sheet during the spring/summer as alight blanket.Cons:After a few washes, there was a mass development of pills!Some of the pills would come off and create quite the mess.(You'll notice this most when changing the sheets)"
1,Laura Ashley? My eye!,"These sheets were such a letdown from the first Laura Ashley sheets I purchased. The flannel (?) is rough, the hems are turned once & skimpy, the bottom is not even hemmed and the corners keeps popping off my pillowtop mattress. Unfortunately, I destroyed the packaging without inspecting the sheets or they would have gone back. Don't waste your money as I did. They are cheap sheets."
4,The wild Hunt,"The Wild Hunt is a story of a young woman named Chantal Fabian who takes a post as governess at a dark mansion called Holy Mote. Living there is the charming but dangerous Piers Perowne, his sister inlaw and lady of the house Mrs perowne, Little sir Hugo, Chantals charge, and a mysterious old nurse who supposedly is a witch. And then theres Lord Mortmain, a handsome man she dimly senses she had met before, who seems to hold Chantals fate in his hands. While she resides there many strange things start to happen, and some suspect witchcraft.I liked this book very much. Jill Tattersall really captues that era and puts them on the page. I also like how within this mystery, there is a love story, but not just any ordinary one. This is a very good read."
5,strap in hang on,"really liked this series ,has helped me with purchasing both my muscle cars ,1970 MACH1 RCODE ,and a 1970 SS CHEVELLE excellent in presentation and information on what to look for, when looking for that special car"
2,REALLY LOUD AND OBNOXIOUS DVD SET WITH EQUALLY AWFUL DVD MENU!!!,"I LIKE THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DVD SET,BUT IT PRESENTED IN SUCH A ""LOUD"" AND ""OBOXIOUS"" MANNER THAT ITS MADE WHAT I'VE SEEN SO FAR ""VERY"" HARD TO ENJOY!!! I WILL ""NEVER"" BUY ANYMORE DVD SETS FROM WHOEVER MADE THIS GOD AWFUL SET!!! ALSO THERE IS NO ""PLAY ALL"" FEATURE IN THE DVD MENU SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP GOING BACK TO THE ""LOUD"" AND ""OBOXIOUS"" MENU IN ORDER TO PLAY EACH EPISODE??? THE DVD MENU PLAYS THIS REALLY,REALLY LOUD,REALLY AWFUL MUSIC."
5,Oldie but goodie,"This one of the first products by Mr. Ginter. As always it fills in a lot of gaps, and since there are not alot of T-28 books out there, this is probably the best thing going. Just remember this book is almost 30 years old. (Now that I think about it, the navy was still flying the T-28 when this book was published.)"
2,Designed to confuse you,"The book is extremely confusing. Some terms are worded differently from any other stats text I had used in the past. I am assuming this is written for a super advanced stats class. However, most excersises in the book can be done in a much easier way, using different formula formats, etc. Verdict: there are other stats text that contain the same information but are easier to comprehend by grad. students."
2,Kindle version is old edition,The kindle version of this book (as of 04/03/09) is the second edition of the book published in 2002. Yet the third edition was published in 2004 and is the one being sold in paperback on amazon. I can't figure out why they used a old edition for the kindle version. Of course I didn't realize this until after I purchased the kindle version.
3,Complete Idiot's Guide to World Religions,"Good for the person just wanting a basic overview of many of the major World Religions, as well as some of the minor ones.You won't receive enough in-depth information to be an expert by any means. However, this book will give you enough information about these religions so that you can at least understand what their core beliefs are.I don't think I would solely rely upon this book to pass a CLEP or DANTES test, but if you have had some previous courses or classes, this could serve as a tool to refresh your memory for a CLEP or DANTES test."
2,Not the Acrobat you know and love,"I've used the past few versions of Acrobat and this one is a disappointment. Navigation is a pain. Instead of the familiar window and arrows at the bottom of a page Adobe's engineers have moved navigation to the top of the page and have only a single arrow.The whole look and feel is most unMac-like, more like a windows application. I suppose if I wanted to take the time and energy to study the user manual I would find the application friendlier but I don't expect to have to re-learn to use an application when I upgrade. If you're thinking of upgrading, my advice is don't."
5,Senco Screws,"I bought these to use with my Senco screw gun and have worked flawlessly. The quality, speed of the projects and for the price you can't go wrong."
1,Norm,I bought this nailer on 11/18/2010 and used it to shoot several test nails. Within the hour I tried using it again and it would not fire. It is a piece of crap. This is the worst nailer I have ever bought and now Amazon will not let me return the item within the 30 day period. This is the last time I buy tools from Amazon.
1,Expensive piece of JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Would not shoot 2 1/2"" sheathing nails consistently,only shot about half of the nails. Wouldn't sink 3"" rink shank nails,left about 1/4"" sticking out. Deafeningly LOUD,especially with missfires.Fuel cells leaked out over night.Even if it worked its expensive to operate.Has anyone compared the price of clipped head nails compared to coil framing nails?! I bought a Bostitch NC80 And it Rocks!!!(I returned my Paslode)"
1,Misfires Constantly,"Received the 16 gauge angled finish nailer as a gift recently. Worked at first, then began to misfire with increasing frequency. Recharged batteries and new fuel cells don't help. Will have to take it to the service center soon, but from the other reviews I've read, I am not holding out much hope of a fix.I don't know the circumstances of folks who claim that their guns work, but Paslode is obviously seling a significant number of guns that don't work. It beats me why anyone would want to roll the dice on this device when a reliable alternative (i.e., pneumatic nail gun) is available. With such a high number of defective guns sold already, has there been a product liability class action of any sort initiated yet? This device is clearly not fit for its intended use."
4,great little finish nailer,"This tool handles most jobs extremely well. In some instances I wished it was 15 gauged but it handled crowm molding, casings and trim molding beautiflly. It is a stong addition to my tool bax,and I would buy it again."
1,Save Your Money,"I bought 6 for a commercial project so that I would not have to drag out hoses/compressors over a large area. I had a straight nailer but after a high failure rate one of my guys bounce tested it. I thought they would have worked out the bugs on the angled nailer that's why we bought 6. All but one gun worked for the project. That was over a year ago. Only one gun operates (sometimes)now. We have the Paslode spray cleaner, boxes of un-expired fuel cells and we are experts at taking them apart we've tried it all. Bottom line - junk, if you travel around with a compressor and standard finish gun like the Senco then you've got a back-up plan; this gun looks good, feels good, convenient but is too inconsistent to earn a living with."
4,Im suprised I never heard of this,"I just happened to rent this because I was out of ideas and needed to put movies into my holds list, boy was I glad I found this hidden gem. Im a huge movie buff and pretty much no about all crime thrillers from the sixtys, but this was a suprise to me. This movie has some of the most beautiful photography I have ever seen on film. The actors were all in fine form, it is a little slow in spots but it manages to be suspensful throughout. Alot of times I find myself dissapointed by these forgotten films,(usually there forgotten for a reason)however grand slam is a twisty clever little crime caper thats worth your time if you like this particular genre."
1,The book is TRASH!,"How anyone could enjoy this book is beyond me. I guess if you like bad stories with stupid endings this is the book for you! Worst ""serious"" gay theme book I think I have ever read."
4,Good read,"A very captivating book with lots of detail... While I have to agree with some of the other reviews when saying that there are parts of the book when the plot is predictable and when there seems to be too much going on, overall I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Once into the story I was not able to put the book down until I knew where the twists and turns were taking the ending.A shame that the book is classified in the Gay Fiction segment, as there is so much more to the book and the story, and this classification might keep some people from looking into the book."
1,"Why, oh please WHY?","Why did I read this book? I guess because I wanted something that would put me to sleep. Forget those expensive pills when you have trouble sleeping, just take out your copy of THE TENTH MAN - it works everytime! Okay for real this book is a snoozer, boring boring boring. There is no need to read more than the first 100 pages, by this point you will be able to figure the whole story out. I am going to stop myself right here, this book has already taken enough of my time."
5,Excellent Book,"This is one of the best books I have read this year. It was a great love story tied in with a major sicko serial killer. The book pushed a lot of buttons, social and otherwise, and I hope that there will be more coming from this author. I would highly recommend it."
1,Blah!,"Yikes! This book suffers from what I will call too much of everything. I did not enjoy it at all, two thumbs way down!"
5,Love this book!!!,"I received this as a gift from a friend who lives in the same town as the bakery. She eats lunch there regularly so gave me some hints on what recipes I should try. I would love to say I have made them all, but every one I have tried so far, my family really enjoyed so I keep making the same things over again. Love the chicken pot pie and chocolate chip cookies.The appeal of this book to me is that it represents a small town bakery. It has beautiful pictures and it is not just a pastry/dessert book, but also has a few other types of recipes. I would recommend this for anyone who wants a good baking book, not just for those of us who have many cookbooks."
5,Oh my.,I love to bake. Have all family gatherings at our house. We also take goodies to friends. This is a sure keeper.
3,Not the same Bible2,"Just to add one more thing to the other review. This is now a new printing, in addition to the slightly different cover it does not use the high quality imported paper. To me, with poor eyesight this is a big deal. I would guess that paper cost have gone up and the publisher elected to use the cheeper paper instead of raise the price."
4,Good Study Skills Activities,"I recommend this book to anyone who would like to improve not only study skills, but test taking skills as well."
3,"Great recording, subpar show.","While this is an amazing recording, The show just seems to lack the flavor and character of the OAR that I'm used to. I've been to tons of OAR shows in my lifetime, and they have progressively gotten worse and worse as time has passed. Instead of evolving into a better band as time passes, they seem to be cutting down on the jam outs in songs, and dumbing the music down for the masses. But I still love OAR for what they were, and always will be, a great live band.[...]"
3,Useful Engine Shed,"Nice Thomas accessory, but the roof doesn't seem to be the right size and constantly falls. It doesn't seem to bother my son, but it annoys me!"
3,Okay for the money,"This Messermeister drawer knife block is made of rubberwood and manufactured in China.I ordered two. The plywood bottom is stapled to the upper part, which contains the slots for knives. Both blocks have dried glue at the bottom of the knife slots.They work just fine and the quality is on a par with much of what is manufactured these days--okay but not top notch.I am keeping them because they fit my drawer space perfectly. The height is lower than many similar blocks on the market.Messermeister 11 Slot In Drawer Knife Holder"
1,even controlled substances couldn't redeem this as entertainment.,"just like The Hills...but worse.might have made an halfway decent vlog a la ""Dr. Horrible"", if it weren't for the acting, story, or production value. more than likely, the wrap party was more fun than the screening.the eye candy however will make it worth the $3 you'll pay at the gas station for this direct to DVD stereotypical high school flick."
5,My daughters favorite picture book,This has been my daughters favorite book from the time she was 1 year old all the way through 2 years 3 months. She loves to flip through the pages and identify very detailed pictures of all types of animals. Its also very informative for adults too.
1,Cartridge failed,This cartridge failed in my Lexmark E320 printer. Gave an error condition and stopped printing completelyNever had a cartridge fail in any printer before!
5,Does it get any better?,"Phungus blends so many different styles into something that is totally their own. With Brillo's diverse vocals to Tommy Canup's innovative guitar work, this is a band who demands respect through talent."
4,Great Story Poor Diction,"I loved the message, the script (what I could understand), the music, the set...the plot development....But Why oh Why didn't the director insist that Anne Heche didn't run her words together...Her facial expressions and movements were beautiful but I had to rewind and re-listen to many of her lines...and it's not that she lacked the ability...In the interviews, she had perfect diction...It was like watching a beautiful paintind upon which someone had spilled a couple of drops of catsup...I still highly recommend the movie...."
2,Probably ok for some viewers re romance and family problems,"I do not own a copy but also saw this on the ""Hallmark Channel"" and had a hard time staying with the slowness of the story.Tho I like things truly romantic I found this weak in length of th courtship part of the storyline and for most part weakness on the son leaving home ending in all is well.Wouldn't recommend or buy it!"
1,It may not work with your phone.,"I just sent my second back to Amazon. I had originally called their cellphone support and they said they thought this device would work with my original iPhone and Nokia E61i. However it doesn't seem to work with either. The iPhone recognized it and paired, but couldn't answer a call with it. I initally was able to pair it with my Nokia, but when I tried subsequently to use it my phone signaled it could not connect with the device."
4,The mouse that roared,I bought this primarily because of OTHER good reviews on it. I use it at home like a speaker phone and as I am hearing impaired it helps a lot. Sound quality is very good for its diminuitive size. Battery lasts a long time or you can leave it plugged in. Have not tried in car but should work great there.I highly recommend.
4,It's sadoriffic,"Tons of sex, nudity, naked fights and other Jess Franco perversions. One of his better movies."
1,Low budget and over-priced,"Unless your an ethnomusicologist interested in the lives of the people behind the music, this video will be a disappointment.The recording quality is awful. I bought this because I love African guitar ala Konda Bonga Man and this was a waste of money."
4,Pretty Good,"I thought it was a pretty good tom petty song, i am even using the song as a dance in a play that i created. it will probably turn out good."
1,Don't waste your money,"The charger didn't work for the i730, the leather case was thin and didn't fit the phone well with the slim battery, didn't fit at all with the extended battery. If you want a decent set of headphones for the phone then this might be for you, so long as you don't mind throwing the rest away..."
2,I was disappointed with this book.,"If you are looking for specific trading strategies this book is not for you. If you are interested in listening to successful people talking about their lives, where they worked and what kind of hours they put in, this book is for you. I was disappointed that none of the people interviewed gave any specific trading strategies. The best advice in there was to limit your losses. Other than that it seemed like they were all just reminiscing to me."
3,"Insightful, repetitive, terribly edited","There are gems buried in the typos, maladroit sentence structure, and confusing punctuation. It is often unclear where the author's comments end and the interviewee's begin. Financial Times is surely capable of better editorial work.That said, the book contains useful guidelines, not only for the challenges of securities trading, but for any endeavor demanding focus, risk-taking, and self-confidence. The book offer no trading strategies, but it provides a useful introduction to the discipline by describing the mind-set and personal habit patterns that lead to success or failure. Again, good editorial work would have pruned much that is repetitive. On the other hand, one could argue that it doesn't hurt to emphasize cricital skills by repetition."
1,Horrible Customer Service -,I recieved my order about one week and a half ago. The front mats that I ordered were the correct size and fit perfectly in my car. The rear mats however. were the wrong size from what was described in the order. I recieved mats for a 7 series BMW but the order stated that it was for a 5 series E60 Model which technically fits any 5 Series. I Contacted the seller to let them know the issue with the order the same day that i recieved the package and i have yet to recieve a response to getting my item exchanged and have my return shipping credited.. WORST EVER. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER
3,Don't order through amazon.co.uk!!!,"I read the above reviews and they were right in one way - season 6 is already released and they are cheaper. HOWEVER, they only come in PAL format for the DVD, so they will NOT play in your regular DVD player here in the U.S. Just a heads up folks :)"
1,US VERSION ARE PETTY IN THESE HALF VOLUME SETS,"DYNASTY SEASON FIVE IS FINALLY COMING OUT SOON ONLY I FOUND OUT ANOTHER HALF SEASON VOLUME FOR SEASON FIVE.THAT IS SO PETTY, IN UK DYNASTY IS RELEASED IN FULL VOLUME SETS AND SEASON FIVE AND SIX HAVE BEEN OUT FOR MONTHS AT THE SAME PRICE OF THESE HALF VOLUME SETS , RIDICULOUS!I JUST GOT THEM AND PLAN TO ENJOY THEM AND BOYCOTT ANY MORE HALF VOLUME SETS OF THIS SERIES."
2,What Happened?,"I really liked Tevin Campbell in Disney's ""A Goofy Movie"". It made the movie really special. But now when I go and see what his old CDs were like, they sound almost nothing like the guy. The music is WAY too slow paced and his voice sounds bored and well... like it's just dragging on and on. Maybe it was because the music was more upbeat and bassey--not to mention totally cool in the movie. I only gave the CD two stars because of his terrific performance in ""A Goofy Movie"". Check out that CD if you want to see the best of Tevin."
5,So much better than bandaids,My husband has been taking blood thinners for years and easily bleeds - a lot! It is so easy to put a sterile pad on the wound and wrap this around his arm or finger or wherever. It stays put. It even stays put if it gets wet. Great stuff
1,I don't know what to say,"The film was incredibly horrible and bad, everything, the film was suppoused to make me laugh, the only things that made laugh was when Junior hipnotizes the dog and tries to wake him,but he is all frozen, also the begining when scene when Junior presses some buttons on a kitchen and then the owner presses the button and then the house explodes, that is all that made laugh, i in reality give it a half star, even though i have enjoyed many films with scatalogical humour, and i don't mind it either, this is the worst, when all the people are vomiting, that didn't made laugh, if you want a better film with scatalogical humour, see the first two ""Nutty Professor"" films or ""Henry Fool"""
4,Good system...just disappointed we have to get a new speaker,This stereo system is great and my daughter loves it. The only problem is one of the large speakers has bad crackling sounds. Now we need to find out how to get that replaced. Otherwise it is great!
2,Stand up tools,"This tool bag is high quality and durable, but I like my tools to stand up in pockets. Your tools in this bag must lay flat in most all cases. small tools and a small quantity may be put into pockets but in the most part you just have to through them in the bottom of the bag and dig."
5,id give it 10 stars if i could,i bought this book on ebay for about $100. although it isnt the same cover.. what i mean is that the copy i got was actually given out at the oscars. it has a black cover glued to the book... the cover has gold lettering. it was made by new line for some of the cast and crew that attended the oscars. it is the single most beautiful and important book i own. if you can get your hands on even a regular cover copy of this book.. do so.. as it is worth every penny... the book is full of beautiful pictures of the set crew and actors.. most of which have quotes above or below them.
4,Hey Mary Richards! Check this out!,"Rocker Joan Jett updates the gentle theme from the Mary Tyler Moor Show with the same basic, two-guitar attack that's made her own hits like ""I Love Rock n Roll,"" such anthems for headbangers everywhere. ""Love Is All Around,"" is an infectious barnstormer; it was featured in the cult comedy, ""Drop Dead Gorgeous."" If TV theme songs make you bounce and giggle, then this track will have you throwing your beret in the air in no time."
1,Do NOT buy this product,This is the worst utility knife EVER MADE. Stanley usually has the highest quality items; but who ever designed this one must have been mentally deranged. It is nearly impossible to reload and requires at least 30 minutes of your time to so during which you will slowly lose your mind. Get the cheaper easier version. Stanley; you should be ashamed of yourselves for putting out such a horrible product.
3,It works!!!,"Purchased this signal for my three-year old grandson's birthday. It was a hit!! He has played with the signal daily and, as hard as he is on toys, it's still in perfect working condition. In fact, this one gift worked so well that I bought more and more and more and he now has a mini-working railroad in his play room."
2,Not so well made,My son loves this. It does have a good sound and the lights are cute but a second after using it one of the signals does not stay up all the time and then the stop sign gets in the way of play. Annoyed with the poor quality.
4,Kudos for historical accuracy. Demerits for readability.,"This book has none of the painfully grating anachronisms that mar most historical fictions. Nor does the author fall to the seemingly irresistible urge to view history with contemporary values. If you want to get a feel for the medieval world without reading text books, this isn't a bad place to look. Unfortunately, *I* found the story to be about as readable as a textbook. The author went on and on with character summaries (which made the book painful to get through) yet still somehow managed to have characters which were rather two dimensional. If the author was going to drag on (and on...) about something, I'd have preferred to read more about the medieval world. To heighten the reading difficulty, the storyline is somewhat choppy. 2 stars for readability. 5 stars for true-to-life facts. Since I couldn't give 3.5 stars, I was seriously tempted to give it 3 stars (ie. average) but decided to rounded up to reward historical accuracy."
1,Sony does not stand behind this product,"I speny just under 8,000 USD for my KDF70XBR950 in August 05 and it recently started showing a blue squiggely line in the center - bottom of the tv. I had a repair tech come out and he told it had a bad optical assy and that I should contact Sony as there was a known issue with this part. I contacted Sony and they claim that while there is a known issue that ""my particular issue"" wasn't the specific issue covered by the extended warranty. Bottom line is they want $1,400 to repair it. So I am stuck with a peice of junk KDF70XBR950 that I paid more for then my car and Sony refuese to stand behind it. Buyers beware - Sony does not stand behind their products. I can buy a new 73 inch Mitsubschi for $3500 so why pay for the $1400 repair for a product that will just fail again....There will never be another Sony product in my household!"
4,Very Good,"This book is very well layed out. It is also very comprehensive. Congratulations to the authors. It is very thorough in its coverage of cross browser problems. My only criticism is that the code examples sometimes contain too many comments. Otherwise, this is one of the best computer books you are likely to find in the store."
4,"Pure Javascript, Pure enjoyment","I liked the book, the examples are plenty, and well done, not partial example clips. The information appears to be very complete, and if your a novice, or an expert, you'll still find it useful. The back page indexes are complete, perhaps too much, which makes finding the logical alphabetical break difficult in some cases. Subtopics are sometimes very long, spanning multiple pages, which makes it hard to find details, but not impossible. Includes compliancy information for the web browsers AND the jscript, ecmascript and javascript. Discusses server side javascript seperate from browserside javascript (very useful)"
3,"A ""Book"" of Two Parts","I've got mixed feelings about this book. I bought it as an update to the first edition, and the information between the covers is very useful in itself. However, the information I really need -- the DOM reference -- has been relegated to the CD-ROM. The reason that I buy reference books is so that I don't have to keep toggling between my code and an on-line reference. The DOM material runs to 400 pages - too much for me to print out. Perhaps Sams could have turned the book into a two-volume reference."
5,"Best Javascript ""Handbook""","This is a handbook or desk reference for developers who already know JavaScript. As such, if you're a developer who regularly (or occasionally) uses JavaScript for client-side and server-side scripting, this book is for you. I've yet to find a better reference for reminding myself of syntax; researching some of the more esoteric objects; and determining which functionality is applicable to a given browser version. What other JavaScript book has 2+ pages on ""try-catch"" with cogent example code? I finally ordered my own copy yesterday after dog-earring my co-worker's copy."
4,Woman Friendly,"Thought I'd get a set for myself, my husband HATES it when I use his.These are great. I'm not sure what torque is, but it sure makes hanging drapery hardware a whole lot easier than others. I havn't even made a ""point"" on the phillips head ones - something that seems to happen with others I have borrowed."
4,Great work out in a short period of time.,"This is a great workout for someone that doesn't have a ton of time and it never really gets old. That being said, the instructor is a little annoying and the work out just sort of seems to ...end. It's like he's doing his thing and all of a sudden someone decided they ran out of time. Still a good, quick work out though."
5,"14"" Blade Slicer Knife w/ Fibrox Handle",I was amazed at how straight and even I am able to slice with this knife. The extra length is great.
1,I also HATED IT!!,"as a few others said, this dvd is exactly the same thing shown on the tv show, NOTHING SPECIAL WAS ADDED!! I remember waiting so long for the tv to air the ""THEY HATED IT"" episode and it was such a disappointment. I sat thru 3 hours of the entire repeated episodes just to see a few minutes of the bonus footage. It was a waste of my time and I wouldn't recommend anyone to waste they're money on this dvd. Just watch trading spaces daily, they show enough reruns that your bound to see it again for free."
5,TRUELY A BEAUTY OF A CD!,This CD is amazing! She has proved to the world that she really should have won Idol! I love her and I cannot put this CD down! EVERYONE SHOULD BUY IT!!!!
5,Works fine lasts a long time,So much better price than the factory and for a factory replacement part it was great. Have had no problems. And agian the price made all the deference.
3,Fearless: When will it end?,"Ok, for all of you that have read this book, it seems that it's starting to trun around from the past two usless filler books. Heather starts to get sick and blackout and Josh tries to save her.Ed finally lets Tataina know that Gaia is the One and she lets him know that she is first choise or no beans.All in all, I know I can't wait to see what happens next!."
1,"Oops, where's that quality control?","I'd love to review this product but when it was assembled, they cross threaded the tube that connects the compressor unit with the storage tank. Once the pressure got up to 60lbs, it began to leak excessively. HOWEVER, contact with Amazon resulted in a new unit being sent to my home and free pickup of the old unit. Maybe I can review that one."
4,good,"I have had this compressor for several years, maybe 7. It has worked great for home use. My only complaint is the drain valve which broke after a couple of years. I replaced it with a 1/4 valve from Lowes $10.If your looking for a good home use compressor this is it."
1,Don't waste time or money on this!,"From the time she began to crawl, our daughter could defeat this. She would either pull it out and away from the VCR, or push the buttons through the plastic. (not stable, no way to keep it in place, etc.) We finally broke down and got an entertainment center with doors that we could hide all the electrical equipment in, returned these and bought locks for the cabinet doors."
1,iNCREDIBLY USELESS!!!,"i HAVE TO AGREE. THIS SUPPOSED ""GUARD"" IS NOTHING BUT AN EXCUSE FOR YOUR TODDLER TO CONTINUE PRESSING THE BUTTONS YOU WANT COVERED UP! My son justs run full force toward it and pushes the tv off and on. Do not waste your hard-earned dollars on this!"
5,Great Read,Buy this book if you do any coaching at work - easy to read - it contains some great insight and excellent information into motivation and techniques.
5,Great Resource for Starting Your Own Coaching Culture,"I have read many books on coaching but none come close to Tom Crane's book ""The Heart of Coaching: Using Transformational Coaching to Create a High-Performance Coaching Culture (3rd Edition). Following the principles of The Transformational Coaching Roadmap is just what today's leaders need to build a coaching culture. After reading Tom's book I knew I had to speak to him about helping me start to build a coaching culture in my company. Tom came through for me by building an online coaching workshop for my staff. His workshop has inspired my managers to embrace coaching as the right way to get results through their people. Not only did the workshop teach them on how to be great coaches, it contained an ongoing implementation process to make sure the learning never stops."
3,Picture?,This is an excellent product I would give it 5 stars but the advertisers need to pay better attention to the product they are selling... The pictured item is not the D5107 tool bag. The D5107 has three pouches running from top to bottom. The bottom two are not side by side.
2,Should have stayed in the short story genre,"I'll confess: I really like Lawrence Block's work. I get his newsletter. I buy his books. But Hit List? Keller, the pro killer engages in the kinds of behaviors that you just find a little to hard to believe. The cynical hit man going to an astologer? And altering his behavior because of what she says? I don't think so. Then there's the matter of the back and forth between Keller and his ""agent,"" Dot. BORING! Filler? Who knows? Seems like Block had a good idea in having a hit man set up as a target. Seems like he had a bad idea in having a short story set up as a novel."
4,engrossing and somewhat grossing out,"I bought this because of a rave review, and wasn't disappointed. It's a well crafted page-turner with a thoughtful subtext about the banality of evil. After I finished it, though, the main character kept coming back to my mind, in an unpleasant way. It's very much about how normal-seeming people can have an absolute vacuum where the rest of us have morals. Knew a guy like this in Vietnam, and got to where I didn't want to turn my back on him ... same feeling with Keller."
2,Block is usually terrific but this one is subpar,"Lawrence Block writes excellent mysteries (especially the Matthew Scudder series) but this one fell flat for me. The idea was a good one, put the hit man on a hit list, but the plot is confusing. Block usually writes beautifully but this one felt stretched out and thin. Read any of the Scudder novels or ""Hit Man"" instead. I think this is one that Larry mailed in."
3,"GOOD, not much.","The characther is impressive. The dialogs, terrific. The whole thing, scary and dark and evil. But it's not the best work from this incredible author. The writing is amazing, but the plot is poor. Better keep reading the Scuder's series or the Rodhenbar's.At least, it's a verygood work."
4,A Good Fast Read,"John Keller is a great invention by one of the great mystery writers of our time. However, I was a little disappointed with this book after the great enjoyment I had reading ""Hit Man"". This book seems to lack the humor of the original. I did enjoy how this book did go a little deeper into the character of John Keller by placing him in the situation of being on a hit list himself. I would recommend this book to anybody who does want a good read, but I feel it lacked a little something."
2,Not so enthusiastic,"I recently purchased this book to add to my eighth grade classroom library, and I am sorely disappointed with it. While I believe many of the boys in my room will love it--mainly for its football action and Miles's inner dialogue--I'm sure others will be annoyed with the stereotypical portrayals of a ""hard"" father, a green-eyed love interest, a ""what do you think"" teacher, and a trying-too-hard coach. Coy seems to have tackled nothing new in this novel."
2,Is everyone yelling?,"Sorry, but I couldn't even get midway through the book. The author is enamored of the exclamation point. Sometimes whole pages of dialogue would have every sentence ending with an exclamation point, even when there was seemingly no motivation for the speaker's elevated level of excitement. This finally forced me to put the book down, as my inner voice was becoming hoarse. I hardly noticed the plot due to this quirk of the author's. Ah, well, it just shows that typos and bad writing style can take away from even the best story line."
3,An Underrated Flynn Adventure,"""The Master of Ballantrae"" (1953) was an appropriate finale to Errol Flynn's 18-year career at Warner Brothers. Reunited with ""Adventures of Robin Hood"" co-director William Keighley, the aging star adds plenty of zest to this Robert Louis Stevenson adaptation. Jack Cardiff's on-location Technicolor photography is a tremendous asset. No classic, but far superior to the actor's latter-day vehicles."
3,Not Bad,"This is a workbook; not a book per se. A series of activities which seem to have been culled from job-hunting and career-changing manuals help you clarity who you are and want you want from your life and work. The basic premise of the book is that if you have direction and have control of your life, your self-esteem will naturally be enhanced. Doing the exercises has, yes, helped me with self-esteem and focus."
2,There are better books,"I'm taking a course on the OT and the prof uses this book. I find the book very confusing at times.For instance, chapters 9 and 10 are very confusing. He explains that Conquest and Gradual Settlement Models of Israel fairly well, but he does not explain the retribalizing. I was asking myself questions such as ""who is retribalising?"" Thankfully, I have a prof that explained this fairly well.If, like me, you have to read this book, I wish you the best if luck in your course. To others, forget this book and get another one."
5,Hopefully a Blu-ray will emerge,You won't find a better adventure movie than this. Stewart Granger and Elanor Parker light up the screen. Fantastic swordfight finish not to be missed.
5,wonderful tale,"It's all about the story. Sabatini used to crank these out - Scaramouche, Captain Blood, The Black Swan - and they were great as books and they have made great movies. This is one of the best. Of course, they have to do some movie shorthand. Stewart Granger (Moreau) has to wind up with Janet Leigh (Aline), so what do they do with Eleanor Parker (Lenore) who has saved his life and has been sharing his adventures through the most of the flick? Watch her skirts getting shorter all through the final duel! I'm not making this up! She starts out floor length and winds up in a tutu! She's obviously not the kind of girl the hero settles down with at the end.Ignore this, or don't. This is still a spectacular movie. The villain is vile. The setting is exciting. The tale is lurid. The acting is delightfully overdone. Sabatini could really spin a yarn and the old Hollywood could really deliver it."
2,"Great quality pictures, but it sucks up the ink!","We've had this printer for a couple of months.As far as the scanner, it has served our purposes with no complaints. We haven't even tried the fax yet, so I can't say one way or the other.Although the quality of the printing is really good, this printer really sucks up the ink! Really that is our only complaint. We just bought a new color cartridge less than a week ago and have only printed a handful of pictures. We already need a new cartridge! We've gone through a ton of ink with this thing. It is also on the louder side as far as printers go.The picture quality is pretty good, so if you don't print much or don't mind buying ink all the time, this printer would be fine."
3,"Good printer/fax/scanner, but INK WARNING","I had an hp refurb for 4 years and it never let me down, so when it was time to re-up I decided to stick with the brand.Everything is great except the (black)ink. I have replaced it twice in a short period of time and now it's empty again. I would think mine is just a defective unit, but I am reading that a number of other are having the same problem. I would still be on my first cartridge with my old one. Considering the price of ink and the inconvenience of Office Depot runs, I think I'll throw this one up on craigslist and buy something that doesn't cost so much to upkeep."
2,Very Noisy!,"I've had this printer a little over a year now, while it's not terrible, there are a few annoyances I wanted to point out for future buyers.1) This printer is extremely noisy, especially while scanning. Both in using the document feeder and the flatbed scanner.2) It shakes a lot while printing. It seems like HP sped up the movement of the printer head in order to speed up the printing process. Consequently the printer shakes quite a bit while printing. I have it sitting next to my computer monitor and it shakes the whole desk.3) The result is that the printed document is a little smeared. I haven't figured out a way to slow down the printer to try to get better quality.The main reason it is tolerable is that I don't print very often. I mostly use the scanner. If/when I get fed up with this one, I'm going to get a Cannon Laser All-In-One."
3,redesigned,was disappointed when these came...they were Christmas gift. They apparently have redesigned them with a stiff plastic in flap....does not lay flat and it's difficult to open/store/carry d/t bulk...sorry....loved the old ones
5,Home is no place without Hood,"Hood is unknown and that's a shame. It's one of the best brittishband. The music they create is a refreshing mix of mogwaiand tortoise: dub, jazz, lo-fi, pop-influeneces. The atmoshphere is one of rainy days, you stay in and drink another cup of tea. 'Hood is where it hurts'is probably the ideal soundtrack for september. 'The cold western lanes' and'the fact you've failed' are weltschmerz-pop.Incredible band! Check also 'the cycle of days and seasons'"
4,The Secret in the matchbox.,Product accurately represented by seller. Good condition.Very quickly dispatched. I am very pleased with my purchase. Thankyou.
3,Good little clock - but LOUD!,"I suppose that it's my own fault. I was excited about getting an ""old skool"" twin bell alarm clock --- that even requires you to WIND IT! I mean, how much more old skool can you get, right?Well, I love the wind up feature (if you wind it all the way, it'll last about 3 days), and the adorable twin bells...but I got this to use as my alarm clock, and the ticking is so loud that it gets annoying by the third night.Also, to turn off the alarm (when you are groggy and barely awake), is a pain, and has resulted in several things knocked over on my night-stand table.However, as I did want a very retro clock - I got it, with all of the problems that ""retro"" items has. Just keep that in mind before you buy."
2,Keeps Stopping,When I got the clock I was excited to use it. Knowing it was going to be a nice loud alarm. After winding it (too tight I guess) the thing stopped and hasn't worked right since. There should be an automatic stop before being able to ruin it by winding it. I would definately make a different choice if I would have known this was the case.When the alarm does go off it is pretty loud.
5,Beautiful book!,"Lots of photos helped guarantee that my 5th-grade baseball fan would love this book. It would make a great read for anyone interested in Babe Ruth, as well as being a terrific and intriguing resource for a school biography assignment. Of course, the added interest of any older person in the family would add to the excitement."
2,crappy magnets,I was hoping the magnets on the liners would work. I specifically bought them for the magnets on them. BIG disappointment. The magnets do not stick.
1,"do not buy this, save your money","I bought this in March to wash my car and boat. I finally tried it out last Sunday, it leaked from the soap dispenser and from where the head screws onto the arm immediately after turning water on. I shut off water, disassembled and reassembled making sure gaskets were in place, and then tried again. It continued to spray a large stream sideways from both joints. Finally, the head fell off and the cheap looking plastic screw that held it together split in half. Of course, it is too late to return, so now I have a $25 piece of plastic sitting in my garage. I'll sell it to you cheap if you want one of these! Seriously, save your cash."
2,Whirly Wash is worthless for a car wash,"This washer is worthless to use on a car, scatches the heck out of it because there are not enough brisles on it, works ok on house siding though"
2,WhirlyWash TWI 9001,Very disapointed. It did the job but leaked terribly at the joints. I tried adding multiple washers at the joints and it did not help. The soap dispenser leaked teribbly also. Won't buy another. I would ask for my money back but I did use it.
1,Shocking,"South Park told the story a lot more accurately and quickly; this is to be avoided unless you've already been brainwashed, and in that case you don't need to see it."
2,NEVERMIND....,"....The Second Rate Film......Watch The Included Short..""Jammin' The Blues"" w/Lester Young & Company...Best Jazz Short EVER..!..The Epitome Of Coolness...TCM Shows This Once Or Twice A Year In A Titled Short Slot...2 Stars For The Film, 5 Stars For The Short....The Grande Kazoo Has Spoken."
2,just not a very good movie,"I had high hopes for this one, especially since the reviews were good and Warners made some great films during this period. I tried my best to like it, but the acting was melodramatic, and script was not very good, and the story not very original. Obviously, the title song is a classic and the big band music was great, but that wasn't quite enough for me. The extras are the only reason I'm keeping the movie."
3,Gong - 'Glastonbury 1971' (G.A.S.),"I just don't get it on this CD release.I mean,it registers as having nine(9)tracks total,but with a running time of a measly 22:41.I've seen this disc priced pretty damn high before.Got one thing going for it,as the sound quality is really quite good.Has just four actual songs,""It's Only The World Said The Girl"",""Fun Goods"",the eight-minute ""Divine Mother"" which is mind elevating and the cosmic ""Bambolayl/Ya Sunne"".Guess what I'm trying to say that if you're interested in purchasing this CD,just keep in mind that it's a short lasting title."
1,Disappointing,"The handle becomes extremely slippery once wet causing it to twist in your grip when you try to use it.I also discovered it separates where the blue changes to white. Perhaps I missed this in the description (?). Anyways, any moderate use of pressure causes it to come apart.It needs to be longer, steadier and softer on the pad."
4,Works great but shows wear,"Great product with excellent features - very user friendly. Unfortunately, the bottom inside shows wear quite easily. Needs larger wheels?"
2,"A poor production, a poor performance.","I hate to say this, but this performance is simply unacceptable.The singers seem each to be in his/her own private universe. The conversations--Sachs and Eva (act 2), Sachs and Walther (act 3)--do not feel like conversations but like two selfish soloists duelling for attention.The sets--especially the second and third act sets--are too abstract to give any sense of Nurnberg, showing no buildings or streets. When the crowd of angry townspeople appears at the end of act 2, one wonders where they sprang from.Even the presence of Matti Salminen, my favorite bass alive today, fails to rescue this performance.If you want a beautiful MEISTERSINGER, go for the Met's recent DVD with James Morris and Ben Heppner."
1,"Do Not buy from Shaver Outlet, Inc..","They are advertising Sanyo battery at the higher price, but sent me generic one, that generic-knockoffs probably made in China. Look for the Sanyo on eBay. They are cheaper there and hold the charges in your shaver much better. And they are 700mAH instead of 600mAH. Amazon should be looking into such practice, when seller advertised products with pictures of brand but sells generic instead."
1,Do Not Buy This Battery,"This item is a ripoff. They show a SANYO battery and furnish an unmarked one. The company is Buy-It-Now-Store.If you do not have a voltmeter, you are stuck. The battery does not have the usual positive and negative markings so you have a 50/50 chance of wiring it in wrong.SHAME on Amazon for selling this junk.Amazon's suggestions as to ""What makes a good review"" is:""Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?""I would have wanted to know that Amazon would not participate in misrepresentation even if it is only 5 bucks."
1,Needs more depth,"This book is filler material, you could find all this info online or in Lowe's or Home Depot. If you have any clue on what you are doing beyond a starter DIY save your money."
4,Great book to supplement lectures,"Truly helpful in clarifying points in the lecture of a feeds and feeding class. Could, however, use examples of ration formulations."
5,Enterprise Content Services,This book does an excellent job of educating business managers and IT executives about the benefits of managing corporate knowledge assets. The authors also provide detail on the human resources required to appropriately manage knowledge assets utilizing the latest technology solutions. I have not found another publication that deals with the human infrasturcture required in order to appropriately implement and support a content managment system.I would recommend this book to anyone exploring the area of knowledge managment or corporate portals.
3,not that great,"I bought this cd because I like ska music, but sorry to say, this cd didn't do it for me. It's more like ska-lite. I'm not saying it's terrible, but it's just not what I expected."
3,Enhanced CD,"This is an ENHANCED CD! This means there is an underlying computer program, so when you slap it into your PC, Mac or what ever, you can't burn individual tracks off it. I'm disappointed that Amazon does not list it as such. Other wise the songs are great. Some one let me know if there is an non-enhanced version out there."
5,This is one of the best CD I have ever bought!,"I don't think there is one song on this CD that is bad! There are various styles of lyrics such as a song about ""SPAM"" and ""Lies"" and one of the more popular songs ""Come on Eileen""... this CD is the best. My friends and I blare it full blast in our car when we go driving around and all... I think you'll really like it!"
4,The Crimson Pirate,I grew up watching these old movies and this one is as much fun as I remember. I've always loved Burt Lancaster in his more athletic roles.
4,"Nice movie, but no extra features...","Nice old Pirate movie, filmed in the lovely island of Ischia. Lots of action but no gory or scary scenes. Fight scenes more on the funny side.. Burt Lancaster did all the stunts himself. Enjoyable for the whole family."
5,Great for the youngsters and young at heart,"Saw this as a kid at a Saturday matinee. And this is the perfect Saturday matinee kind of movie (assuming they're not showing a western, of course). Lots of spirit and laughs. Super stunts which Lancaster and his sidekick pull off with gusto. Vivid color. What's not to like. Story is average plus but what it lacks is made up for in the fact the movie doesn't take itself serioulsy at all, and is used primarily to link the physical stunts. It's all fun and it's all good. Best pirate adventure right up to Disney's Curse of the Black Pearl."
2,Not what I expected,"These wore out within a week. Fun while it lasted, but I expected something a little better."
4,Hard to get on for a novice.,"Once I got the hang of how they fit onto the walker, they went on well and look great. Mom loves them."
2,Unpleasant walker balls,"Balls have a very strong, unpleasant odor. Even after letting them sit on the porch for 2 weeks & spraying them with a fabric deodorizer, there's still a lingering odor. Other than that, they're run of the mill walker balls."
1,Made my throat itch,"No mention of sensitivity in description. I gave it to my husband. No feedback from him, yet."
1,"Make it stop, dear GOD make it stop!","The promo picture that came with this CD showed most of the band hiding their heads and I have to at least give them credit for that. This collection of tired beats, deliberately misspelled words (what sort of street cred are these blokes looking for?) and limp songs doesn't show a shred of originality. Sure, the songs have some energy, but only as much as the preprogrammed beats can muster. Distorted vocals and screaming into the void does not make a song relevant (the aforementioned misspelled fiasco ""Foot Soldierz"") nor does a chorus repeated until you want to put a drill into your ears make a ballad catchy (the utterly dreadful ""Morning Afterglow."")Arista seemed very high on these lads, and their 'flavor of the month' status should hopefully make sure they're dropped back into obscurity with a lack of dignity befitting them."
1,Not As Advertised,"The ""peaceful ocean surf and sounds of ocean waves"" come with the sound of a great air horn. It sounds like a freighter to me but perhaps it is light house horn. Seagulls barge in loudly but the best is yet to come--wait for it!--Whale song! I want to visit the beach this guy went to. Imagine, hearing whale song while sitting on the beach."
1,Inca History review,"I selected this book purely as an interested person in Inca history and not as a student of their culture. Unfortunately I found the book to be very difficult to follow, getting lost in the vast number of names. The low rating was given, not because of the content, but more of the way the information was presented. I tried on 3 separate occasions to re-read the first 45-50 pages but finally gave up in frustration."
3,"Wish it were thicker,","I also bought the wrong size,it was too big. The thin mat slips around on the table as you put the pieces together. If the mat were thicker or had more grip, this would improve the puzzle mat for the 1000 piece we were working on. If you only need a storage place for the puzzle, this product should meet your needs."
1,Unsatisfied,If I knew all this product was going to be was a piece of felt and a cardboard roll - I would have never purchased this item.
2,Not a good toaster,"I bought this toater oven on a whim based on the price and good experience with Cuisinart. While it works fine as a small oven it is a lousy toaster. The bread dries out long before it begins to carmelize, and it is slooooow to finish."
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT,"I had an very old black and decker which worked OK, but was definitely showing its years. I decided to replace it with this more stylish product. Now I so wish I hadn't. Despite the pricetag and the pedigree this is a terrible product. It burns nearly everything nomatter now low you set the controls. If by chance the first piece of toast escapes, the second will be cinders. The handle broke almost immediately, and the sliders move at the slightest touch so that it is invariably miss-set. I am replacing it, and will definitely not be buying another cuisinart."
1,Chemical Emissions,"We tried to use this toaster several times but the chemical smoke that was emitted seemed unhealthy and, after 12 times or more, we decided to return the toaster to Amazon."
3,It was alright,"As a kid I liked the movie. Still a pretty good one. Only difference is that I give it a 3 when as a kid I would have given it a 5. Still worth watching though. But as I had read more on the legend of King Arthur and watched recent movies portraying other angles to the story, this movie leaves out a lot of important details and adds new twists that disappoint this version. This is more of the fairy tale version of Arthur. If I had to rank the King Arthur movies, I would put Excalibur first followed by King Arthur, The Last Legion and then Knights of the Round Table."
5,Sweat shirt,I bought this for a gift. It is just what I thought it would be. I love it. it is just right.
4,Modern Reading Text 4/4,Is a good text to practice sincopation and other tricky rythms but for someone that has more experience is a little bit simple.
5,Amazing and wonderful,I bought this several months ago and it continues to strengthen and inspire me. The visualization techniques really work and the music is beautiful and calming. I often use the tape nightly before going to sleep. The affirmations are equally effective and I really enjoy Ms. Naparsteks soothing voice.
1,Infomercial,"This is one of the very few books I've actually returned to the bookstore. It is just one long infomercial for Dr. Sears' fish oil product. He should pay me to read his book, not the other way around."
4,It's defininetly a game worth getting!,"Even though it took up a load of memory and took forever (give or take a few weeks) to complete, it was certainly the best game I have ever played. The language interaction isn't just cool, it's downright fun. The game is extremely complicated, but the people who made it are real user-friendly, and made a strategy guide for people like me who often get stuck. Once you get yourself going on this game, it's pretty hard to stop. The game is extremely creative and extremely fun as well. I might add that this game is not for people with little patience. You'll never complete the game if you're all tense. I could tell you why, but that would be a spoiler."
5,The Masters of World Funk and Soul,"These original funky brothers from all hailing from the West Indies created the most amazing and invigorating fusion of funk and african reggae ever heard.Most famously sampled by the Fugees, De La Soul ,EPMD and many others. Cymande is one of the most sampled bands in Hip Hop ever.However, no longer is this band hip hop's little secret. This album allows new listeners to hear the great original tracks in a re mastered format. Featuring ""Brother's on the Slide"" and ""Listen"". This is an anthology of their most memorable material from the original 3 LPs recorded the between 1972-1974 in London, UK. Its unfortunate that their amazing musicianship was too unique for the period.Yet today people are rediscovering and grooving to these hidden jewels. Dive in and feel the Funk!"
5,CYMANDE FEATURED IN SPIKE LEE'S NEW MOVIE,"The Tracks, ""Dove,"" ""Bra,"" (check the anna paquin hallway dance scene) and the classic ""The Message,"" are all featured during the supposed hot DJ Dusk club appearance. Its interesting that they all talk about how cutting edge the DJ is and then he plays and scratches over 3 classic Cymande tunes. Perhaps cutting edge to some but standard classics to me. If you don't know about Cymande then you need to discover them. Its really that simple. I don't care who you are. Cymande is loved by Spike Lee and people all over the world. These are all classic Funk tunes. WHAT BAFFLES ME IS THAT PEOPLE WHO LOVE FUNK OR EVEN THE GRATEFUL DEAD ARE UNAWARE OF THIS GREAT BAND'S RAW POWER. DISCOVER BROTHER'S ON THE SLIDE, BRA , LISTEN, and THE MESSAGE."" DIVE IN, GET LIFTED AND FEEL THE MESSAGE. Go check out the best latest remastered collection entitled,Cymande ""The Soul of Rasta."""
1,Vague,"I expected to be able to sense and feel somewhat the Paris of Stein's time. The writing is so poor grammatically that one wonders how it was published.Rambling, with little focus, it was a disappointment. Perhaps I didn't find the nuances that were intended to engage the reader."
1,WHAT A STINKER OF A MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!,"If I could give this movie half a star I would.......I agree with John""s review of this waste of time..........I went to see this stinker the other night looking forward to seeing Mickey Rourke.......On this so called comeback trail...movie.......well let me some this movie up for you in two words......."" IT STINKS""......Marisa Toume........whom I happen to like a great deal........remember her in ""My Cousin Vinnie"" ?......well her un- stellar performance in this horrible movie.....i dare to say will not put her in line for any acadamy awards.........Do yourself a favorwait till this stinker makes cable.......or catch it on Netflix....By the way did I let you know that it stinks??????"
2,pretty boring,"This movie was simply boring to me. I don't even understand what people mean by depressing, I didn't care about any of the characters to be that depressed, just bored and tedious by the same formulas used over and over again on every single drama that is of this type. Its simply teeth grindingly annoying. I fail to remotely see the appeal or what is even all that great about it."
1,Why Buy?? You know a special edition with commentary and better extras has to be coming out.,Buy?? You know a special edition with commentary and better extras has to be coming out. We've got to stop jumping at these lesser releases and teach the studios not to double-dip.
3,Rocky Not,"Not all movies have happy endings. This is a engaging story about an aging wannabe, like all of us, who meanders through life finding his ego. Great protrayal by Rourke and acting superb throughout, but felt something was lacking about this film in the end..."
2,"See Warrior instead, this is a waste of time","washed up, broke, lives in a trailer that he can't afford, hooked on steroids, alienated his only child - this is a sad, slow moving, and predictable story.I did watch end-to-end but honestly, it wasn't worth my time.Wanna watch something from the same genre but much better? see Warrior"
5,Mickey Rourke was robbed!,"Let's not kid ourselves - just give the Best Actor Oscar to Mickey Rourke right now, because there is no competition. This is the role of a lifetime for him, and he plays it to perfection. And luckily, the rest of the movie and cast holds up as well, making this one of the best of 2008. Oh, and the fact that Marisa Tomei gets naked? That's just a bonus on a movie that already rates 5 stars!!"
3,The wrestler,Good movie but predictable. A lot of performers in these brutal sports go through this tough and wild lifestyle. They realize what's important when it's too late. Then loose it all.
1,Horrible.,"I hated this book. I enjoyed all the books in the ""American Dreams"" series except this one and the two other books about Rosie and Raider, the worst characters ever."
4,Into the Wind,"Rosie is a 17 year old girl in colonial Mexico when her father is killed. Faced with no other choices, she joins Raider Lyons, who rescued her from her father's tavern. While on board his friend Octavia's ship, Rosie meets many interesting people who help Rosie understand more about the world. The book is suspenseful and interesting, however it leaves one hanging at the end. Rosie makes a very life-like heroine. The book is easy to follow in terms of old clothes, terms, etc. Some of the book tends go off the main topic, but the little side branches are interesting and made me want to be Rosie. To fully understand the ending, one should read the sequel and the sequel's sequel, Song of the Sea and Weather the Storm. The ending is very abrupt, but Song of the Sea takes up the story with almost no break."
1,Bad book.,This book was a waste of time. It wasn't worth reading. No one should waste their time reading this book because it is awful. I think this book should not have been published.
2,I hated this book.,"I hated this book. It was boring, stupid, and pathetic. The sequals are even worse! This book shouldn't even be in the American Dreams series; it's not American!"
1,ICK!,"This was an awful American Dreams book. I can't believe they made 2 other books on it in the series! First of all when the series is called American Dreams why do you make the setting The Yucatan, Mexico? The main character doesn't even care about America or anything to do with it. Even Raider doesn't really, he is just trying to find his brother. Aside from nothing happening, her old Cajun friend Tuti tells her about love, and it is so boring! The romance part of this is awful! I'm usually not a romance fan but still I can say I've read much, much, much, much, much better romances than this. Rosie is not a likeable character and the topics of their speech in this book isn't exactly what I want to read for an hour. The only reason it didn't get a 1 was because it had some historical research done."
1,Yawn..,"This book was incredibly boring. I really did hate it. Why would you like someone like Rosie? She is stupid, helpless, and more. Even when Rosie was trying not to be helpless she always need help somewhere down there. Also, everything was so melodramatic! Hasn't Jean Ferris heard of of REAL life before? I can't believe I wasted my money on this one! I could of bought Angela's Ashes or something.."
2,"WHY WB, WHY???","Ok, hands down Justice league is one of the best animated DC show ever put on TV. And with Lustice League Unlimited on the way, its going to be even better. Who wouldn't want to collect this shows on DVD. Now on the next matter, I've noticed how everybody else commented on the number of episodes on this DVD and other ones like it. Technically its only 2 epsisodes if you put the part 1's and part 2's together. I wouldn't mind paying $80 - $100 for each season if WB puts it out. The reason I gave this DVD only 2 stars is only because of the number of episodes in this DVD. Each individual episodes are 5 star worthy but if WB keeps on doing this, its not only gonna lose its fan base but also is going to lose its viewers eventually. Its about time to put out the seasonal box sets. DO THE RIGHT THING PEOPLE."
2,Too Crumbly,These Graham Crackers break and crumble very easily. They taste good but every time I eat them I end with crumbs everywhere!
5,A Must Read For All Young Adults!,"I've read this book 3 times over! It has a great plot and it captures the readers attensions from the very begin (which is a good thing to keep a young person interested). Me being a young adult myself, I could relate to characters, and it is as just a great book focused on and for the African American youth."
3,"Much smaller than we expected, unfortunately","This item is probably okay, but unfortunately way smaller than described. We followed the directions exactly to measure my daughter's hand but she can't get her fingers into it at all. Since shipping was almost as much as the item by itself, we're not even bothering to return it. Also apparently she was expecting one that had a little dowel-thing. We had better luck getting an adult one, at 4 times the price :("
1,Complete garbage -- your wine is in danger,"DO NOT BUY. We trusted our best wine to this cooler, but at some point over the last several months, it stopped cooling. Worse than that, it actually HEATED UP. When we discovered that it was heating rather than cooling the temperature in the cooler was 95 degrees F and most of the wine had breached their corks. Why would they not have a simple shut off at any point if the interior exceeds say - 70 degrees???. They should assume there has been a catastrophic failure and just shut down. It's very sad... I notified Cuisinart, to which they replied that the warranty excludes incidental damages."
1,Stay away from this item!!!!,"As with many of the other reviewers on this site, our wine cellar is less than a year old and no longer functions at all. After a few months it gets louder and louder until it just stops working altogether and actually HEATS UP, completely ruining eleven expensive bottles of wine! It is still under warranty, but Cuisinart makes the customer pay for the expensive shipping in BOTH DIRECTIONS due to their shoddy craftmanship! (Not to mention the cost of the irreplaceable wine that was lost due to this bad investment...)"
1,Simply Awful,"Looks nice, but never worked properly. Doesn't cool. Loud fan in place of actual coolant. Too expensive! Company doesn't stand by the product and you'll jump thru hoops just to find out that you have to pay to send yours in AND then you'll have to PAY to receive a replacement! I cannot believe they haven't recalled this item!!! Look at the other reviews... the only positive ones are from people who haven't had the thing longer than 30-90 days! STAY AWAY or regret it - like I currently do."
1,Cuisnart Wine Cellars Breakdown and Fail to Cool,"This is the second wine cellar that I have from Cusinart. The first unit died and right after the warranty expired. After a discussion they sent out a replacement unit that lasted only 6 month. Yes that's right ONLY 6 months. Again the cooling element failed. The second time I contacted Cuisnart's customer service department, they were very rude and not understanding. They told me that due to the fact they replaced the first unit,that the second unit was only covered under the orginial warranty. But wait,... the second unit didnt even last one year. Again...6 months only. And yes the cooling capability is really wimpy. After talking with a refridgator specialist friend, he stated that these units constantly fail. Dont buy Cuisinart wine cellar products, they dont last."
2,I am so disappointed...,"We received our unit last night and we were so excited - it looks beautiful, so compact and beautifully designed. Unfortunately, I can't BELIEVE how loud it is...it soundslike a room fan on its highest setting, and that is in my air conditioned house.It's going to be a pain to return since it is so big."
1,I suggest you buy a different brand,"I received this unit as a gift 1 1/2 years ago. It is an attractive unit, but was always a lot louder than I thought it should be. Just a few weeks ago, it started a very loud vibration that I can't seem to fix. Now, I have to unplug the unit at night because it makes to much racket. I don't believe I can justify paying to ship and fix, so it turns out to be a complete waste of money."
1,MAJOR design flaw -- DO NOT BUY,"DO NOT BUY. We trusted our best wine to this cooler, but at some point over the last several months, it stopped cooling. Worse than that, it actually HEATED UP. When we discovered that it was heating rather than cooling the temperature in the cooler was 95 degrees F and most of the wine had breached their corks. Why would they not have a simple shut off at any point if the interior exceeds say - 70 degrees???. They should assume there has been a catastrophic failure and just shut down. It's very sad... I notified Cuisinart, to which they replied that the warranty excludes incidental damages. Stay away. Danger. Do not buy. Avoid Cuisinart and Conair products as they appear to have a long history of customer dissatisfaction. They are a private company and are not under as much scrutiny as a public company would be."
4,Mac Dre,Mac Dre is skilled although he is not well known. His songs almost all have good beats and the rapping fits nicely fits the music. He is tallented and underated. This CD would make a nice addition to any collection. It is not an outstanding CD but it is vey good.
1,Not a Buddhist product,"Using the term 'Nichiren Daishonin' in the title infers that the CD is intended for Soka Gakkai or NS practitioners. No one in these communities would use a Gohonzon as cover art, which means that the CD is probably simply intended as a commercial product and not as a product of a compassionate spirit. Gongyo samples may be downloaded for free from www dot sgi-usa dot org slash thesgiusa slash downloads."
1,Why buy when it's available on SGI website for free,"The recitation is available for download on the SGI site. Why would one want to purchase it? I found other sites where people are ordering so much so it's backordered. Once again, the SGI website gives free download."
2,"unfortunately, kind of boring","This CD is rather a disappointment, I think. I love Richard Buckner who does back-up on here and like Jeb Loy Nichols (also on harmony/back-up) too so I figured this would be well worth buying. While there are a few good lines, riffs and moments on here, overall it is an uncommonly boring CD -- not good for driving, for example."
2,cool camera......but those darn white spots,"I really liked this camera.........cool looking, easy to use, and it takes great photos with natural light.......... But when you turn out the lights and need to use the flash......well just like many people here will tell you.........RANDOM. WHITE. SPOTS.Sometimes 15 other times 1 or 2. For me it occured on about 90% of alll photos that require use of the flash. Now I bought this at best buy and I took it back and got another coolpix s9 ( I really like the camera) and the same thing happened. Of coarse the Best Buy ""Digital experts"" told me it was user error. I'm glad to see its not just me."
1,avoid NIKON like a sick chinese chicken,"I went through the process of sending my camera in to the nikon repair center. it was used very little, in fact it appears brand new. it had never been mistreated, wich is what nikon tried to convince me must have happened because they refuse to believe that they have sold an inferior product. they never told me what is wrong with the camera but wanted $146 to fix it and send it back. the only solution is that everyone send their s5 back to the service ctr and refuse to pay to have them repaired. they e-mail a survey and if we all give them low marks maybe they will decide that they should take care of their customers a little better, especially with todays economy. the survey asks if you would purchase or recommend NIKON again. I told them that I WOULD AVOID NIKON LIKE A SICK CHINESE CHICKEN."
1,Very Poor Quality Printer,"This printer is by far the worst printer I've ever used. It's very prone to jamming, takes almost 4 minutes to boot up when turned on, and worst of all it doesn't work well with Windows Vista. If you have XP then you probably won't have as many problems as I did. However, with Windows Vista it very prone to spit out junk instead of the document because of programing problems. Do yourself a favor and avoid this printer."
5,These pantiliners are great. .,"I had an awful allergic reaction to liners that I purchased at the drugstore.After using Seventh Generation pantyliners for two days the allergy was gone, never to return."
5,Trust In Monster,"As we all know, Monster cables are supposed to be the best. I have to agree with that as all my equipment is connected with Monster cables and I never experience any problem whatsoever with transmission of signal. There appears to be little or no degredation of signal with these cables."
1,Hacking Answering Machines Big Joke,"""Let The Buyer Beware"" applies in this case! The ""Book"" if you can call it that is a whapping eight pages, an eleven pages of other titles for sale, followed by an order form so you can loose more of your hard earned money.The number of pages would be unimportant if they contained at least something useful. It was sold as ""Hacking Answering Machines"". Hacking implies working with and altering the software within the system for your own purpose. My intention for purchasing this book was to learn about how the answering machine works, so that I could hack it, well forget it.By hacking they mean get the remote access code and redo the outgoing message (hee hee hee). And how do you get the code? Why just ask your victim for it, or look on the bottom of his machine. THAT'S IT the entire hack.Don't waste your money or time."
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"THIS IS TOTAL, AND UTTER TRASH! I MEAN A PERSON CAN ONLY HAVE SOO MUCH RETRO-70s CULTURE AND CHEESY ACTION SEQUENCES BEFORE HE OR SHE LOSES IT. OK...LET'S MAKE IT EASY. TAKE SHAFT, REMOVE EVERYTHING COOL, AND NOW ADD THE PLOT STRUCTURE OF A CONAN MOVIE AND A BAD 70s PORN, YOU HAVE THE GUY FROM HARLEM. IT'S SAD, WHEN THE HIGHEST BUDGET AMOUNT FOR THE FILM WAS ON THE FRO-SHEEN. SAD SAD SAD MOVIE."
2,Cant Handle Power...,"i put this thing on a very strong amp and it blew the rubber sealings around the speaker clear out! looks like there was a stick of dynamite on the inside. if u plan on listening to loud music, especially for a long duration, then this speaker is not ur friend. died on me only after a few months. first power test took this thing off the planet for me. the solo baric was definitely the better choice as i still have it today, even after continuous abuse and hours of pounding on the highway."
3,Striding the fence,"I had high expectations for this album - lead by my musical enthusiasm for both Gil Shaham and Renee Fleming. While there appears to be a sincere attempt at giving classical offerings a fresh yet authentic rendering, I believe that the arrangements fall short of being either interesting or inspiring. The guest performances are superb, and I expected no less from such talented musicians. But the soft and melodic piano, and the overly accessible classical guitar work are just not that far from sounding like excerpts from movie soundtracks or television show intros. I don't think ""smooth jazz"" stations would be playing tracks from this album, but if they attempted it, they certainly would find the right audience - those who do not care for much complexity or dynamism in their music. I cannot recommend this album for even the modest classical or jazz fan. It's just too smooth."
1,disappointing,I liked the book and the story so imagine how upet I was to go thru 5 of the 6 cds only to fine out the 6th one was missing and I couldn't finish the book. Very upset with this.
1,Very Disappointed,"I had looked forward to reading this book as the author had in the past few years been writing so well. I was very disappointed in this book and actually felt embarrassed for wasting my time reading it. It was such a pathetic literary effort. I felt angry that Ms. Brown would actually sell this knowing that people would buy it simply because of her past efforts. The book was boring, contrived, and obviously took a lot of effort to write and stretch out so little into even the short book that it is. I tried to give this book no star, but the system requires at least one."
2,Standoff is a write off,"Although this is not a best seller it is interesting reading. There were some scenes I found funny and some that were actually suspenseful. I would not recommend the book to anyone who is seeking a ""hot"" read for the summer, because ""Standoff"" will not qualify. It's good for reading in an airport if you have a long wait and you don't have any other books or magazines of interest to read while you wait on your flight. This was the last hardcover book by Sandra Brown I will buy. I will be content to wait on the next book to appear in paperback. I am disappointed after all these years to make such a statement. Maybe in the future she will return to the type of writing that made her famous and wealthy."
3,Not Brown's Best,"I have enjoyed many novels by Sandra Brown, but unfortunately this is not one of her best. It is an easy read, quite a short story actually - it could have easily been a paperback rather than a hardcover book. If you are looking for a fast and predictable read then you will enjoy this one."
2,Standoff,"The standoff starts out as a book that caught my attention. In the beging i wanted to read more and more to see what was happening. Twords the middle of the book i thought it was getting to long and to drug out. The content of the story is in the same atmosphere for to long. I thought to many un needed detail was applied. It turns out to be drama and love in one which is fun. The ending of the story was ok. It didnt tell to much of what happened with the characters i wanted to know about, but between two other characters it gave a hint to what was going to happen. I guess i didn't really enjoy the book as much as i would of liked to, because of it's long and kind of borring content, but it had some edge to it. My rating i give is two stars."
4,If you dont like quickies dont read it.,"But if you do like shorter books, this is about as good as one can get in a couple hundred pages. I thought the story was intresting and the pace was very good. I'm very glad Sandra Brown didnt try to extend the book. It ended when it was over, and she didnt worry that the story was too short. Just read it."
2,Bring back your old style of writing.,"What a disappointment. As an outline for a good story with interesting characters and situations, this is a good book. What has happened to Sandra Brown's writing style? If you want to read some of her good books, read MIRROR IMAGE, BEST KEPT SECRETS or FRENCH SILK. This book is so short that you do not have time to ""care"" about any of the characters. It could have been so much more if she had taken the time to develop the characters. Where is all of the wonderful detail that is found in her earlier works?"
1,"Even if you haven't read it, you've read it before","Standoff is such a thin, formulaic ripoff that I can write out a recipe:1 semi-glamorous, shallow heroine1 tall, dark and handsome hero with a Tragic Past1 froth-at-the-mouth villian, complete with rifle1 pair foxy grandma and grandpa1 large gratuitous sex scene2 surly foreigners2 confused teenagersPour into convenience store, sprinkle with cops and TV cameras. Shake, and serve.The resulting froth tastes like its cardboard characters, and will remind you of every TV suspense-movie-of-the-week ever made. There is absolutely nothing original, interesting, or memorable here: a complete waste of time."
2,Not enough,"This was more a novella than a usual Sandra Brown novel, and as such, was pretty blah. The story never fully develops beyond the actual standoff situation, and we're never given a chance to really connect with our main characters. Brown also uses a main character combo (a successful tv reporter and the man she has mistakenly wronged) that she returns to in a later novel, Smoke Screen. We get the obligatory sexual tension between Tiel and Doc, followed by the obligatory sex scene, but it all feels very... obligatory. Step 1: Woman finds herself in life-threatening situation with mysterious, handsome man. Step 2: Woman and Man band together to escape situation and bring it to a happy ending. Step 3: Woman and Man have life-affirming sex to cope with traumatic situation. This could have been great if it had been written with the complexity you usually find in a Brown novel. Instead, it just left me wanting more."
3,Brown Needs A New Blueprint,"Sandra Brown's STANDOFF follows the same blueprint that nearly all of her novels utilize--a scrappy heroine who gets embroiled in some criminal activity and in doing so subsequently meets her future paramour, someone who always has a tortured past that they literally can't get past. Heroine in question here is television news reporter Teal McCoy who, on a vacation trip, takes a detour in order to follow a story and ends up getting caught in the middle of a standoff at a convenience store. Among those held hostage with her is a man called Doc, a doctor whose wife died under ""questionable"" circumstances. You already know how this is going to end from the get go, which makes the read even less fun. At some point, Brown needs to devise a new twist in her writing, because now she just seems to be using the same basic backstory for the main characters and substituting new names."
1,Flat and predictable,"I was hoping for a pleasant distraction, but this books plot plays out as predicably as any formulaic made-for-TV movie. The principles are so flat that I had trouble finishing this very short work, mostly because I found myself not caring about what happened. Perhaps the worst contrivance I have ever read occurs when the male antagonist's father relates a story of how, as a boy he kidnapped and killed a neighbor's poorly treated dog (just as he was now kidnapping and perhaps killing a poorly treated girl). Yikes."
1,Very disappointed,"As a number one fan of Sandra Brown I am deeply disappointed in her last few books. Her whole style of writing has changed. She seems to be getting further and further away from writing romance novels. Being a avid fan of her previous books I just feel let down. I hope that she starts to realize her fans want romance back in her writing, which is what she does best, and not what she has been handing off to us."
4,Good Book,"I just finished this book and it was a very exciting read. It only took me 2 sittings to finish it off, but that is because I could not put it down. Don't let the fact that this book does not have a huge plot with many twists and turns turn you away. No one is mistaking this for a literary masterpiece that high schoolers will be required to read 50 years from now, but it is still a really fun and exciting book."
5,Love it!,"I fell in love with Heap's song ""Hide and Seek"" from the 2007 Grammy Nominees selection album. I looked her up and bought this CD. I love it! Plan to buy her other work as well. Not at all disappointing, as you sometimes find when you have only heard one song from an artist. I am satisfied! I don't want to categorize, but she almost sounds similar to what Enya might, if Enya sang pop music."
1,Warning: This CD will install a Windows VIRUS,"Please do research on the Windows virus that this CD will install on your computer before purchasing it.Reports are that the malicious code is installed even if you explicitly instruct the software not to. The software leaves your computer even more vulnerable to remote installation of software that can turn your computer into a SPAM relay. The best part are reports that attempting to REMOVE the software can render your computer unbootable!In my humble opinion, such tactics are inexcusable. Shame on you, Sony! It is your music, but it is NOT your computer!There are two other options for obtaining this album. One is ordering the import release, which costs three times as much, and takes a month to be delivered. The other option is to find the music online, either on iTunes, or somewhere else.Kudos to Sony for forcing honest consumers into a situation where they must consider stealing the music as a valid option."
2,Sing to yourself to!,"The hit ""Hide and seek"" is great! I cannot justify buying the whole CD for one song. The other material is okay but forgetable. Buy the ""2007 Grammy nominations"" CD, instead. It has Imogen's hit on it and a whole lot of other good music, as well."
1,This should not be in NEW AGE,To put this album under New Age is defenitely misleading. it is NOT NEW AGE!
4,As heard on TV,"I first heard Imogen Heap on the cancelled Ray Liotta series ""Smith"" on CBS. There was a montage at the end of the episode set to the song 'Hide and Seek' which is a good song with a slightly different sound. A couple of weeks later 'Hide and Seek' was also heard on ""CSI: Miami""... I haven't checked but guess that CBS must own the record label as well! Ha ha!I ordered the CD and listened to the entire album which has several good songs on it. I shared the CD with my 16 year old son and he really liked it too so he received his own copy for Christmas.I think it says something when a 49 year old man and a 16 year young man both enjoy the same modern artist."
5,So beautiful,"As always Imogen outdoes herself. The beats are driven, textured, the sound complex. Her vocals and lyrics always are beyond pleasure.I thought Details was amazing. This is further than amazing!"
5,ornate collision of silk and plastic.,"Imogen Heap is what you would get if you shoved Kylie Minogue, strike that, Kate Bush and Orbital into Brundle's transporter and hit go. At least, that's the way it sounds to me. This is not a bad thing. Rather, it's ridiculously catchy, and contains uncommon lyrical depth. The first three tracks are sublime electropop (Headlock, Say Goodnight and Go, Have You Got It In You?). The fourth, ""Loose Ends"", is the only song I would consider weaker than the others. Luckily, she follows it up with a showstopper: ""Hide and Seek"". The rest of the album cannot be ignored either -- ""The Walk"" and ""Closing In"" have proved to be enduring highlights for me. Overall this is superior music, and I've come back to it over and over. It joins Supernature (Goldfrapp) and Grace (J. Buckley) as soundtrack to my life kind of albums."
5,Amazing as usual,"Imogen Heap has once again created a truly beautiful and lush collection of music. An incredible album! There's nothing more to say than what all the other 5-star reviews say, but there's one thing I must point out. All those people complaining about the copy protection aren't exactly 100% accurate. I bought the copy-protected version and could still rip it onto iTunes and on my iPod. It plays perfectly. I guess it depends on individual computers.?"
1,copy protected,"I love this artist but I will not buy copy protected work. Almost all the music I listen to are my own playlists, which are for my own use. If I can't copy it I can't use it."
1,very BAD experience,"I did NOT get my DVD !!! I paid for it and the freaking seller NEVER contacted me o try to do it, I mean the less thing than he or she would do is let me know there is NOT a DVD or a REFUND!!! so NOT stars even a one!!! I feel so cheated on for a freaking seller with no remorse, SCAAMMER!!!! I understand he or she (the seller) has to feed his or her family!!! next meal on me!!!"
2,"Love The Look, Quality Lacking","I chose this watch for its Great looks, and I wanted a watch that would last me a long, long time. I have owned this watch for 11 years now. The first problem after a few years was the black paint coming off the numbers on the bezel. I had it repainted once and within 6 months it started coming off again. Looks junky as some parts of the numbers have paint and some don't. The clasp on the band bends over time so the watch keeps popping off when clapping hands or bending wrist. Have to keep getting it adjusted. Within one year of warranty ending the watch died and I had to get the movement replaced. That bill was well north of $200."
5,I love it. had it for over 8 years,"I got this watch as a gift from my wife.her brother bought it in Switzerland when he was there on buisness.I very seldom ever take it off. been snorkeling,diving,etc for years this watch has never leaked.I love the way it feels, just the right weight.I have gotten countless complimets over the years on how well it looks.It has taken a beating over the years,it has alot of tiny scratches on the band and face but the crystal is still perfect.Im planning to buy another one for casual and dress and keep this one for work. it still works great.I found if you turn off the second hand(top button) the battery lasts much longer. I would recomend this watch to anyone.I love it....Skybuster"
3,"Nice stainless steel cage, chain leaves something to be desired",The stainless steel cage that holds the suet is nice and truly stainless steel. I was worried squirrels would open it as it does not seal very fully so I added a small clip.The most disappointing thing about this is that the chain it comes with is notthe same stainless steel and is not as shiny and attractive (seems to be tarnishing). The hooks that come on the chain are rusting. Working with the hooks and the eyelets was a little awkward and I broke out some pliers.
5,Awesome,"This is some of the best east coast hip hop in a long time besides definitive jux, x-ray is dope...fresh beats, and lyrics...nicely done...buy it...10 stars!"
5,Off the chain,This is definitely one of the best CD's ever. Kirk Whalum always picks some of the best jazz musicians to perform on stage. These musicians feed off of each others musical spirit and that makes the music flawless.
3,Worth A Listen.,"There's not a such thing as a bad album by The Fixx. Ink is not a favorite album, but there's some pretty good stuff on here anyway. ""How Much Is Enough,"" is my favorite song, and it speaks lengths musically and lyrically. These guys always offer something challenging lyric-wise. Also this album has a low price that can't be beat. Overall a pretty good album."
4,Get Your Fixx,"I am often amazed to discover the titles that have fallen into the ""Shame It's Out-of-Print"" File. This is not currently available? Wow. That just should not be the case. Although the Fixx were well past their commercial apex by the time this came out in 1991, they were creatively in stride. With the possible exception of 1986's ""Walkabout,"" this was probably their most completely satisfying album from start to finish. If you dug hits like ""One Thing Leads to Another"" and ""Stand or Fall,"" this will not disappoint you. As a matter of fact, it should pleasantly surprise you."
1,it's a crime these fools are rapping,more wack albums by these fools and having lil scrappy on it does'nt help. hear scrappy's dating diamond good when they both play out he can pimp her 4real.
1,this machine [isn't good],I thought I could trust a Singer. WRONG. I spend more time trying to unjam the machine then I spend actually sewing. There's always something wrong with it.I grew up sewing on my mom's ancient singer (one of those cute little black machines that only goes forward). That thing is probably 60 or 70 years old and still sews like a dream. I wish my mom would trade with me...
4,They want you to believe it isn't true.,"Laugh through this compilation of some of the best urban legends, rumors and silly tales we've all heard. Unfortunately, some will read this book and claim it doesn't prove anything. Sure, thats because Queen Elizabeth, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and the committee of seven planned it that way! (wink wink).A fun book to read."
1,Not only is it as bad as everyone says...,"...but the story that inspired the title isn't even a real UL. It actually happened, to an actual high school classmate of mine! The story was written up in Long Island Newsday and can be researched with some effort. [I can even supply the classmate's name via email if you want.]When you have as much going against you as this book does (and please read the other reviews for what other people think), that's a resounding vote of NO confidence. Sorry."
1,He managed to suck the life out of Urban Legends,"THis book was given to me as a gift. I enjoy reading urbanlegends, and have even been victim of a few. The author managed tocompletely suck the life out of the urban legends he includes. Byediting them down for length, the plausibility of each story iseliminated. Very few were left intact.It is also irritating tofind several stories inside which are true, or not ULs at all.Including Microsoft easter eggs.If you love Urban Legends, checkout one of the many sites dedicated to them online, and save yourmoney."
2,Disapointing book on urban legends.,"I thought this book would discuss urban legends and give additonal information about them. It merely list the legends. We know these stories are not true, but we are not told how the stories spread or any other interesting information about them."
3,A Bit Disturbing,"I have to agree with the comments re the child rape. A bit uncomfortable and a bit overdone in the book. I really liked the beginning of the book, but just felt like I was on an unpleasant roller coaster as the book continued. There just seemed too much to cover and not enough pages to cover it all. This led to some superficial and static character development.Overall, it was a good effort."
2,disgusting,"first of all someone recommed me to try a book from this author and i chose to read adora since it was on sale...after reading the book i was left disturded for a while and in shock...a 13yr old is rape by an 60yr old man then suddenly she finds pleasure in him..r u kidding me..to make it short, adora is constantly rape in the book even by the man she loves..sighs..i guess i better go back reading books by johanna lindsey, brenda joyce, judith mcnaught etc...atleast there books leave a smile on your face!!"
1,WARNING: THIS BOOK IS CHILD PORNOGRAPHY,Ms. Small apparently believes that writing about children being RAPED is entertainment! Has she never heard of pediaphiles being inspired to ACT OUT after reading or viewing child porn???! This book needs to be banned as it crosses the line. I've read Ms. Smalls books before and her facination with rape and perversion led me to stop buying her books (and I am not a prude!). This one should've landed her in PRISON!
4,A Stunning Vocal Ensemble and some very fine songs...,"I must say that after seeing approximately 40 Broadway shows, the cast of ""Titanic"" must be the most impressive vocal ensemble I have ever heard. Yeston truly writes songs for the singer...some very lovely melodies that capture the mood of the show beautifully. No characters are fully developed, as was the author's intention. As a result, however, the score ( and the show) suffer a lack of flow and continuity. The entire opening sequence and the lovely first act duet ""The Night Was Alive/A Telegram"" are reason enough to purchase this CD. Although the show is flawed...it certainly a worthwhile purchase for anyone who appreciates fine ensemble singing."
4,"Great, but not the best ever","Although I enjoyed this score a lot, I can't seem to shake the feeling that something is missing. Although it is certainly not worth the 1 star reviews that people seem to reserve for what doesn't meet their expectations, at the same time it doesn't quite seem to reach out to my heart the way some other musicals do (to name them would be pointless and more likely to incite an argument than anything)"
3,"Great opening, but for the rest....","The first five songs are great! It is just too bad that the rest of the recording couldn't keep up with that emotion. If your a fan of Broadway, then it should be in your collection, but if your having doubts: don't get it."
3,Amazing arrangement,"The subject matter can turn anything to gold: the movie and musical taking top honors in their fields in the same year. Titanic's in open season, and this musical may be the best thing ever to come of it. The orchestration alone is worth buying the CD, but once you hear Brian d'Arcy James as Frederick Barrett, you'll wonder why you (or your teenage daughter) ever thought Leonardo DiCaprio was ""romantic"". The lyrics are beautiful, but the song styles and rythyms sound out-of-place at times. There's a lot of recitative, and all the talking-to-the-beat becomes rather irritating at times. Honestly this album is worthwhile in the vocal and orchestral strains, but if you want a good Broadway show, look elsewhere."
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!,"In a community play, our director had us do ""A Salute to Broadway"" . At first I didn't like the Broadway music and now I absolutely LOVE it. One of the songs we sang was God-Speed Titanic. It was the hit of the show. This is a MUST buy item for anyone who is a Broadway fan."
1,wait... it gets worse,"I read where someone said what they liked was that it didn't focus on one or two characters. Are you kidding me? That's the whole problem. There is no character development. They introduce you to a million characters, then kill them. We get no history, no development, no linking, no compassion or detail, no story, just here they are... opps... they're dead. Save your money. Even if it's onsale for a penny."
3,Powerful but battery is replaceable,Just received the vaccuum but was disappointed to learn that the filters AND the battery are not replaceable. The filter looks kind of flimsy and I doubt it will hold up very well. Hopefully Dirt Devil will wise up and make the filters available for purchase. I tried to gather more product information before making the purchase by visiting Dirt Devil's website but since this model is so new it wasn't even listed.
3,A helpful introduction to practical Taoism,"Hua-Ching Ni provides a simple and practical introduction to Taoism. The book is pleasant and can easily be read in a short time. Perfect for individuals looking to get started in practical Taoism. For those interested in a more detailed history of Taoism and its religiosity Eva Wong's ""The Shambhala Guide to Taoism"" would be a better bet. Those less interested in detail and more in the ""big picture"" should stay with Ni. A nice little book."
3,Old school..,"Violetta .. I love Moffo, but here she is a governess. She doesn't look like as a Madame.To my mind her emotional vulgar. Be that as it may, the opera main means of expression - music. Bombastic emotionalism - is for the theater, where the actor is no other means to transmit emotions.And, why does every note she sings ""with dispersal""? You like it? I do not like.All the male voices are marvelous. May be sometimes they are very academic, but on the other hand they are so beautiful. (And their singing is not stupid theatrics.)I am glad that I heard this performance and I like that, but it's not my favorite performance.Netrebko as Violetta are better.11/2011:You may disagree with me all you want, but if you are younger than 50 years, I do not believe in the sincerity of your love for this performance. It's boring."
4,Iteresting Bbook,"While I was a little unsure of this book at first I kept and open mind until I read through the book, and it was worth it. I really enjoyed reading this book. It takes an interesting look at working with pop culture entities in a constructive way through ritual. Regardless of if gods are actual beings or simply archetypes of some sort; for some people its hard develop a connection with a classical god or goddess. The use of pop culture magick is an interesting alternative in that respect. Even if someone is comfortable with working with ancient god and goddess, pop culture magick is still an engaging way to work through rituals and magick. Pop culture magick may not before everyone, but the same is true for other forms of magick. An interesting book to read."
1,Please Next Time Less Appendixez and Worksheets,"This book was not too great. I enjoyed small sections of the book, but all in all I wish I had not spent the money to purchase it.If you subtract all the appendixes and worksheet/exercises, the book is a whopping 50! <-- pages less the length listed. I feel a little deceived by the total page count."
1,very bed quality,"every year I had changed replacement Heads and it was really good during a year. But this order is very bed quality. On the third day it start working even worse then the old one. I order another set but particulary for my model but again received the same item. It was useless to explain something to sellers, because they offer item for my model(and even picture of pack was different) but sent me the same plus almost $10 plu for shiping and tax. For this amount of money it is better to buy new model. Shame of you"
5,Makes Razor Like New,Replacement blades fit in easily and restore razor to like new performance. It feels good to have close shaves again.
5,If You Loved the Movie...You'll Love This Soundtrack!,"It's been a long time since there was a soundtrack worth buying, and this one is definitely worth every cent. From ""Cruisin'"" by Gwyneth Paltrow and Hughie Louis to the beautiful a cappella version of ""Freebird,"" this soundtrack is great!"
4,Very enjoyable!,"Gwyneth Paltrow has sung a little in a couple of her films (Emma, for example), but finally she appears on a soundtrack! She valiantly tackles ""Bette Davis Eyes"", which I think was a bit out of her range. Gwyneth really shines in her duet with Huey Lewis, and she and Babyface are incredible in ""Just My Imagination"". Except I think in the original, sung by Eddie Kendricks with the Temptations, had more pain at the heart of the song, whereas the heartbreak is a little lacking in this version. Anyway, hats off to Gwyneth, she really can sing!As for the others, Paul Giametti (who did a great job in Man on the Moon), does a good cover of ""Hello It's Me"", while Maria Bello is suitably sultry on ""I Can't Make You Love Me"". The ""Copacabana"" remake is fun as well.A great job by all. By the way, I can't wait to see the film!"
4,Duets worth a try!,"I bought this CD after hearing a sampling from a local radio station. Although the track with Huey Lewis is on the current play list, the duet with Babyface (Just My Imagination) is better. I tolerated Bette Davis Eyes, and most of the other tracks are worth listening to. Gweneth Paltrow is definately a talented person."
1,HORRIBLE JUST HORRIBLE,"My grandpa loves this cd it has good material but most of these people can't sing.I mean all they did was take a bunch of actors give em' a mic and a jute box and called it an album.Aside from how bad this album is the movie was rather good it had a suprise ending,but this album is horrible the only 1 who could sing was the black guy arnold mcculler he sings beautiful he should have been on a better soundtrack (and no babyface can't sing) any ways don't get this thing it's horrible"
1,My least favourite version,"It simply tries too hard to be hip and smart and funny, and as a result it's none of them. Musically, it manages to make the score sound flat and almost dull.Avoid this one. There are far better ones available. This one simply misses the mark."
1,RIP-OFF,WHEN I GOT THIS IT SAID 2.5 CARET WEIGHT. WELL THEY CAME AND ARE .2 CARET WEIGHT AND ARE SO SMALL I WILL GIVE THEM TO GRANDDAUGHTER. NOT WORTH SENDING BACK AS IT'S TOO MUCH BOTHER TO DO!! WHAT A RIP-OFF. I WENT BACK TO SEE IF I READ IT WRONG AND IT'S STILL LISTED AT 2.5 CARET SIZE!!
1,No Music videos,No music videos like Beavis and Butthead of old. Dont waste your time or money on this product.Episodes are short and chopped up.
2,This kind of sucked.,"The thing is this book was awfully boring. It's about a witch who heals people; when she's not healing people she's thinking about being a witch and healing people. Seriously, that's it. That's all there is to it. The fact that she's a witch that can heal is supposed to be like, some huge secret, as she faces getting burned at the stake, but apparently the instant something's in need of healing she forgets that--I swear, she'll heal anything in sight!The so-called ""romance"" between this chick and this married a-hole nobleman seemed pretty nonexistent and not really worth mentioning. To be fair it wasn't like it was horribly written or anything--it's just, I think I'd actually rather read those stupid Witches of Eileanan books.... I mean, I only paid 50 cents for this, yet I still felt cheated."
5,Affordable Swiss Watch,"I bought mine last year and have never regretted it. A solid piece of work. If you want a swiss automatic but can't drop a few grand, this is your watch."
5,Great Blu Ray!,The performances are great and it was good to see these four bands play their best songs! This blu ray is a must own for the heavy metal enthusiast! \m/ \m/
2,Review from Student in Calif.,"This book was required for an HTML class that I am attending at Orange Coast College in California. I am disappointed at the fact that it was seemingly not proof read for mistakes before publishing. I did learn alot from the book. I had never been exposed to HTML before this class, and I found this book to be a little hard to follow at times. I think that the material is there, it just needs a going through by a professional proof reader before its next release. This book is OK at half the price."
4,"Great book, but...","There is something weird about these on demand prints. I came across a few typos and I just didn't feel like I was reading the original book with Jacobson's exact words. Don't pass up this book, but I suggest going with a different publisher."
3,Good and Bad,"Bad: The brush continues to rotate, even if you are only using the attachments.Bad: The attachment hose it too shortBad: The vaccum tips over easily.Good: After tipping the vaccum over because of reaching too far with the short attachment hose and then the brush sucking up my purse strap because it was still roatating, neither the vaccum nor the purse were harmed. Although it let off a smell of burning rubber, the belt did not even need to be replaced.I'm adding to this review because now I probably have to get a new vaccum. The casters will not roll anymore, I think because some hair has gotten wrapped around the axle but even after pulling out some hair it is no better. This makes the casters a disadvantage insead of the advantage I previously thought. Also, the motor is suddenly louder.I don't think I would buy this vaccum again, but I'm not sure that any other $80 vaccum would be any better."
5,Great!,"Great popper. Looks good, easy to clean, makes popcorn quickly. Just add butter & salt when done if you like."
1,Very Disappointed,"This product is great in theory only. The promise of getting the taste and crunch of a pan-popped corn was a pipe dream. The design is poor. The lid traps the steam inside during the cooking process and results in tough, rubbery, styrofoam-textured corn. Plus, the popped corn had a weird taste that is indescribable.We are loyal Cuisinart customers and have used the same model coffee maker for over 10 years. When one wears out, we quickly purchase another of the same. We were very shocked that Cuisinart developed such an under-performing product. And, as popcorn lovers, our disappointment was huge."
3,Not what I expected based on other reviews,"I certainly hoped for better quality than what it is based on other reviewers. Maybe they were comparing this to video produced 20 - 30 years ago. It has a general lack of contrast. Under the ocean is just about the most colorful and brilliant environment, but you wouldn't be able to tell that from this video.There is good information, but the narrarator is very monotone. He has a British accent, which is fine, but there is a lack of excitement to his narration. It is obvious he is just expressively reading a script.The video is edited in a similar fashion - quite slow and unexciting. I could see a classroom falling asleep while this is shown.I may be spoiled by David Attenborough and BBC for quality and excitability, but it is a shame that one talking about God's creation is not as excited about David Attenborough talking about ""mother nature""."
5,My thoughts on Living Kindness,"Every time I sat down with Living Kindness was like a relaxing vacation from daily stress. And more than an escape, it helped me feel better about myself and my world, and better prepared to return to my daily challenges.It is also a painless, accessible way to learn about different religions, and better understand that the areas of broad agreement are more important than the differences on which contention is too often based.It then goes a step further to show how those beliefs can be incorporated into life as it's lived in the real world. Although the author has taken vows and lived in a monastery, he never makes you feel as if that is something you need to do yourself. Quite the contrary, in a tone that is never preachy, this book reveals the knowledge and a few simple ""experiences"" that can help you find greater peace and fulfillment in the life that you're already leading."
1,Center Channel and Subwoofer Reversed,"I tried this BluRay in three different players. In all cases, the Bass and Kick drum are all that is coming out of the Center Channel. Virtually nothing out of the subwoofer. It seems that either the sound engineer really goofed here or I have a special Disc!I noticed a number of reviewers that were unimpressed with the sound compared to other BluRays, well this would make sense considering what I discovered. Wondered why nobody else noticed this."
5,Cute costume,The is a very cute Capt Hook costume for boys! My 3 year old lives it and was the cutest pirate we saw all night while trick or treating. It doesn't come with tights or shoes so I bought those separately. I did have to use safety pins to pin the coat so it was stay in the right place or it easily becomes out of place. We may could've used a bigger size.
3,Not so easy to wear but looked cute,cute but complicated and a little small for my 3 tear old. he would not wear the ruffles. i later saw one at disney store that i liked much better.
4,Cute outfit! I would love to have the hat; but it is to expensive!,My grandson loved the outfit! He'll be able to wear it again next year.He is really into Captain Hook!
4,this CD proves she is wasting her talent most of the time,"Charo was at one time named the best flamenco guitarist in the world. This album proves her chops, and shows she has serious musical instincts when she chooses to follow them. The songs are mostly excellent, and the performances outstanding. I worked in a music store, and whenever I would play this CD we sold copies in droves. Very very good."
5,Charo knows her way around the fretboard.,"Charo is amazing. Many people don't realize what a beautiful performer she is when it comes to traditional flamenco guitar style. You might get so caught up in her ""amusingly"" broken English, and her overly exploited ""mature sexuality"" that you might not even know what a great musician she is. This CD is worth it's price, and will likely become one of your favorites. This CD is different from her earlier work, much more polished and seductive. Fans will definitely appreciate her efforts.Oh, and if you've only heard of Charo because of her appearance on VH1's ""Surreal Life"", you owe it to yourself to have a deeper listen. Granted, her voice is not everyone's cup of tea, but her guitar style is second to none."
2,A live taste demonstrating a versatility of styles.,"Live renditions of 3 different songs with different musical styles. The band is versatile, performing ""Bittersweet"", ""Circle"", and a fresh twist to Sly & the Family Stone's ""Everyday People."""
1,"Not for young, teething puppies","This product is promoted as safe for puppies but my nine week old Boston Terrier has choked on them. He is able to bite the tip off with his razor sharp teeth and has no regard for how big the piece is. They only last maybe 20 minutes tops. I won't buy them again because even while being supervised my pup is fast and can down large chunks before I realize it, and after choking twice on these bones ...no more Nylabone Edibles for Petey!"
4,Great!,"As someone else stated, these are not for young puppies. My dog is young, about 7 months old and is able to enjoy one of these daily. He lays down with it, and it takes him about 10 minutes to thoroughly get through it. They provide a great chomping experience for him, rather than a chewy item so the texture is different. He's a pointer mix about 35 pounds so he's not tiny but not large either. They are a little pricey, but do not have an odor like the pig ears or bully sticks which is something I like about them. I'm considering buying them in bulk on Amazon. I gave them 4 stars only becuase they are expensive and short lasting."
2,This CD needs a replacement....,This CD is nothing like the music and soundtrack of the movie itself. If you have that expectation you will definitely be let down.
1,Disapointing,How disappointing this is. I just rented the movie and was excited to hear all the neat songs. I was all set to buy the sondtrack. Who put this together any way? I will not be buying it now. Go back to the drawing board and put all the good stuff back in.
1,A HUGH DISAPPOINTMENT,"I gave this a rating of 1 because there is nothing lower. After watching the movie I was exited about what I thougth would be a great sound track, but then I found the CD and saw the list of songs. Why did the record company even bother to include ""I Will Survive"" and ""Rock and Roll Part II"" since they omitted the rest of the great songs and included nothing else but substandard back ground music? This is, with out a doubt, one of the worst sound tracks ever produced. What could they have been thinking? Certainly not about releasing a CD of good music."
5,great product!,"I didn't buy this tea maker for myself but for my husband who drinks about 5 cups a day. He raves about it! We had a tea kettle that we would heat up on a stove top but this tea maker saves us time and money on our electricity bill. It is very portable too. He is a teacher so he can bring it in the classroom if he wanted to. It's a wonderful concept-- good tasting tea that is quick and easy to make whenever you want a cup. If you love to drink tea throughout the day, I recommend buying this tea maker. It is small enough to go with you to the office or stay at home."
5,The BEST Teapot,This teapot is the best tea maker I have ever been able to use. I highly recommend this product. 5 family members & friends have already purchased and like it just as much as I do!
4,A great inspirational story,"While the Blessing series is the dearest to my heart, this is still a wonderful collection of stories. The characters are real and bring life to the stories of the settlers to this area of the country. A definite need to read!"
2,Rumi Turning Ecstatic,"'Rumi Turning Ecstatic' did not hit the spot for me. For a more comprehensive representation of Rumis life, work and the spirit of his teachings watch 'Rumi Returning, The Triumph of Divine Passion', a more expensive purchase but well worth it."
5,Love It!,I am a Sunday School teacher and i ordered this bible for one of the kids in my class. I really like the size and the fact that i got it the next day!!!
4,Timberland Men's QT4117102 Eastender Classic Watch,"Timberland Men's QT4117102 Eastender Classic Watch.Excellent packaging and good watch despacho.buen time seller, would say only that the side shield is very sensitive and open when you least expect, is very useful and versatile."
2,"Great for the first year, now need to replace","This toaster oven was great for the first year or so. Then we started having occasional problems with the door not staying shut. Now, after 3 years, the door never stays shut and the toaster oven tends to burn most things. We are ready to replace it! I thought that a brand like Cuisinart would make a long-lasting appliance, guess I was wrong!"
1,defective door,"Although the toasting function worked well enough, the door developed problems after just two months of use. I will avoid Cuisinart small appliances in the future."
2,Defective Door,"Like so many others, after just a few months, I'm left with a door that won't close, and a broken handle due to frustration and jousting with this terrible annoyance."
1,Mine was broken,"My unit arrived missing the arm that connects the door to the toaster-oven (it's actually rattling around inside the body of the unit). My experience with this oven and its predecessor has been that Cuisinart's manufacturing standards have gone downhill over the years, since Conair took over the company and merged it with a lesser line. The return policies of both Cuisinart and Amazon are designed to be so burdensome to make the time and aggrevation of replacing a defective item not worth it. Bottom line, Cuisinart is no longer a premium brand, so don't pay premium prices for it."
4,classic toaster oven,"Nothing fancy about this knob type toaster oven. NOT digital. NOT convection, and to get to the crumb tray you have to move it and slide the tray from the BACK. Now, given all this, it is a basic toaster oven that we use mainly for toast, grilled cheese and didn't need any of the other fancy stuff. It replaced a digital KRUPS which eventually broke its front loading pull out tray. SO, we went back to the basics.....and love it."
2,Works well--when it works,"I like this toaster oven very well--when it works. The problem is that the crumb tray needs to be in an exact position on my oven, and if it's not in that exact, precise spot, it won't work. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING as the exact spot is very difficult to find. I'm finally giving up and donating the thing to Salvation Army as I'm tired of dealing with it. I do not recommend this product unless you like solving problems before toasting your bagel in the morning."
3,"works well, has issues","We had one of these for just short of its 3 year guarantee period, within which time the paint on the interior walls was all coming off, and the door hinge stopped working right. Cuisinart honored the guarantee and sent us a new one, which we've had for just a few weeks. It really works great in terms of even baking and has enabled us to use our full-size oven much less, and it toasts well. It looks great and is easy to clean. I'm hoping they've solved the paint issue, which made me nervous, and that the door will hold up this time....but having read the other reviews here, I guess I won't get my hopes up!"
2,Lasted 9 months,"After 9 months of use, an audible ""snap"" was heard; the clippers no longer cut hair although the motor still works. Although still under warrentee, I elected to instead purchase a set of quality Oster clippers (Oster Fast Feed, about twice the cost of the Andis clippers.)Pros: Case and attachments are nice. A lot of features for cost.Cons: Not a high-quality product. I expect a set of clippers to last a decade or more."
4,saving money,"It paid for itself in two uses. This is a great, easy to use product for someone who wants a buzz type haircut. I've only used it a few times on my son's head so I'm still trying to get used to it. Cuts very well. Not too noisey or uncomfortable to use. So far I'm very pleased with this purchase."
1,"Don't buy this, get Aimee's real music","Like all the other one star reviews here, I'm not judging the quality of Aimee's music --which is outstanding, and which I've been a fan of since hearing the Magnolia soundtrack-- but rebuking the industry weasels who chewed up her material and spat it out again for consumption by an unsuspecting public."
1,Boo! Hiss!,"You CAN go wrong with this disc. In fact, you WILL. This compilation is a misappropriation of Mann's words, images and songs. It was not authorized by her and its purchase should not be encouraged."
3,"She's a genius, but this collection is far from ""Ultimate""","Aimee Mann is a genius, and if you haven't yet purchased her solo albums, skip this collection altogether, because it isn't represenntative of her best work. The selections miss the best of her Til Tuesday work and take far too much from ""I'm with Stupid"". And it completely ignores Magnolia and the brilliant Bachelor #2. Why? Because Hipp-0, the label involved here, is really Universal/Interscope, the label that refused to release both the Magnolia soundtrack and Bachelor #2, leaving Mann with no choice but to buy the music back and distribute it on her own. Of course, she ended up becoming a bigger success than she'd ever been while signed to a label, so here is their attempt now to cash in and fill their coffers (not Aimee's) by releasing any tracks they could get their hands on. UGH>>>>>"
2,Belly Dancing with Mara III: Advanced Techniques,"This is an OK video (overall). Mara is a good instructor and explains the movements clearly. The only problem I had with this video is that the tape is too short and I think it's a bit pricy for the length of the video.Mara spends only a small amount of time for each movement, this makes it a little harder to follow, because I had to keep rewinding the tape. If only she spent more time on each of the moves (I'd say five minutes or so), instead of what seems like 1 minute or less for each move and if she would have spent more time explaining how to do the more difficult movements, then I'd definitely give this a higher rating."
3,Problem with the Vidal Sassoon VS783 1875-Watt Professional Anti-Static Ion Dryer,"It' s hard putting the brushes and combs on the hair dryer . It's a pain in the neck. The brush attachment is also a bit too soft. I like leaving the brush on as I dry my hair,but you can't do this with this dryer. You have put the combs on to dry your hair with this hair dryer or just take all attachments off and dry it without attachments. They to work on the design of this dryer. I like that it is an anti-static ion dryer."
2,Not as expected,"This was such a waste of money for me. I need to pull a brush dryer through very wavy, thick hair in order to straighten and smooth it. The brush on the Sasoon dryer was too soft to work for me. If your hair is thin, it will do just fine."
5,Hair Dryer Vidal Sassoon,I am happy with this hair dryer could not find it in the store. Look for week to find it
5,chev,I love this hair dryer. It works great. It is the easiest dryer to style my hair. I wish this hair dryer was available in stores for purchase.
1,Died suddenly after 2 months with a loud 'pop' and a lot of smoke,"I LOVED this dryer while it lasted, bought it to use in Europe last month and had no problems using it on 220 in some houses/hotels in Germany, Sweden and England with very old wiring. Decided I liked it better than my regular dryer so started using it daily when I got back. Last week I heard a loud pop and it whined to a stop and lots of smoke emerged. So now I'm trying to figure out if I can file a warranty claim when I didn't keep any packaging and bought in on Amazon and can't find a Vidal Sassoon website that is helpful. If I were you I wouldn't risk buying this."
4,VS Hair Dryer,"I am so glad that I was able to find the Vidal Sassoon hair dryer through Amazon. I have owned several of them over the past ten years or so, and then all of a sudden you can't find them anymore. I have bought a different brand at the store, but it just doesn't hold up as well. Thanks Amazon."
3,German armoured cars,"This book has a good bit of historical information that is very good.However,From a model builders viewpoint, it is not very good.There are virtually NO interior photos. There are some decent line drawings, and in action pictures, but I would not purchase it again."
5,Some of the greatest soul-blues around!,"I'm usually not very much moved by soul-blues nor contemporary soul or R&B.;I just prefer keep on diggin' the Soul Stirrers, Sam Cooke, the Swan Silvertones, and, on the other ""bluer"" side, Magic Sam or Albert King. But this veteran of the ""chiltn' circuit"" is really something else: great vocals and guitar, superb composer and arranger, excellent musicians around (including Eddie Kirkland and Phil Guy on this one). I've get some of his previous JSP's in the late 1990's, and those ones pleased me. But I think this is the best of the lot. Poor art cover and design (as usual on this company) But fantastic stuff! 5/5"
1,This Software has Audio Problem.,"I bought this program 10 days ago. But I can't use this program, because of Audio Problem. I can't hear any sound in Listening Section. But when Tutorial and Direction part, I heard all sound that make.I installed this program at 3 computers, But Same thing happened.So I exchange this for a new one. But same it is.I Send E-mail to Tech-Support@ets.orgBut they did not reply.Do not buy this program."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT.,"I was left without any preparation for the Toefl test because of this software. When I bought it I checked the tutorial (and the audio worked just fine unlike the previous reviews). But When I wanted to use this software to practice on the weekend before I took the test, whenever I tried to run the practice tests I got a page fault exception and I had to restart my computer.I think it is outrages for ETS to sell this product with so many bugs."
1,Agitated Minister,"I am a Minister at my local parish, and upon purchasing this CD at my local pawn shoppe, I was anxious to get it home and listen to it over dinner with my beloved family. I soon became deeply disturbed by its content. I could not believe the vulgarity that spewed forth from my compact disc player. Since my children were in the room, they became frightened and I was forced to put them to bed early and bless their soiled ears with holy water. Since this incident, my wife and I have been praying nightly for the restoration of our children's innocence and that Bradford Robinson's soul may be emancipated from an eternity spent in the bowels of the fiery underworld.Peace be with you all, Reverend Johnson"
4,Makes great waffles,"I made my first waffles ever on this machine and it hasn't turned out a bad batch yet. The waffles cook evenly, and quickly, the machine is easy to use, and has a nice look to it. The only complaint, really no big deal, is that you cannot remove the plates for cleaning. In truth it is still very easy to clean without this feature."
3,Bun Warmer Cover Needs Improvement...BIG time!!,"The first time I used the grill and lifted the lid to put on my dinner, the entire bun warmer cover fell off.....After I properly reattached the lid, the cover stayed ""on"", but it fell OPEN everytime I lifted the ""oven"" cover to take the food out and the little ""lift cover to open"" tab fell off....I LOVE the way this grill cooks, but I wouldn't buy it again if you paid me......Who needs this aggravation????"
4,Works well.,"Considering that this isn't the most advanced memory card on the planet it does a very good job. I use it to store music for my handheld computer. I have nearly 250 songs on, with room for about another 25 or so before it runs out of memory. It works without any problems when connected to my handheld or my desktop. It was worth the money for what I use it for."
3,Interesting read but a little longer than necessary,"While this book immediately captured my attention and I couldn't put it down for the first half, I found the writing to drag in the second half. The story of the author's search for information regarding his mother who died way too soon, was indeed touching."
5,Of Time and Memory,This book was very interesting. Don Snyder keeps your attention with his great way of telling the story of his mohther's life. I live in the area that this story takes place and my mother-in-law was Don's mohter's neighbor growing up. She is even mentioned in the book. This book touched my heart in a special way. You feel like you are there living out the life of Don's mother Peggy Swartz.
5,A must read-,"Finally, a nice book to read that maybe reflects some events that go own in your own respective life."
1,Is this the state of modern horror writing? Uh-oh.,"I picked up The Darker Side with the hope of exploring new, young authors in the horror genre. Unfortunately, if these writers are representative of current horror trends, then the whole genre is on the verge of collapse. The anthology's first story was the best, and there were occasional authors who showed a flash of talent, but overall, the stories alternated between boring and horrible. There was nothing remotely frightening or disturbing in any story in the book. Instead, many of the authors seemed to devote their energy to creating ""adult"" (i.e. poorly written sexual) material or over-the-top and substandard descriptions of murder instead of creating a decent story. At times, I wondered how these stories could be a credit to an author's reputation. If you want chilling and effectively written horror, there's always Poe and Lovecraft. Unfortunately, no author in this compilation comes close to their abilities."
4,Locks to time signal every night,"Nice watch if a little thick. No problems after a month. Recharged very quickly and has not lost maximum charge level. Previous ""atomic"" watches I have owned have lost time synchronization at night. Not this one. Very reliable. The only thing missing is a non-reflective coating on the the crystal. I good buy for $100."
5,"Easy to use, quick to learn","This is my first-ever sewing machine, and I found it very straightforward & easy to learn. The instruction booklet is comprehensive, with lots of good graphics. I love this machine!"
1,Don&#65533;t count on the rebate if you buy from Amazon...,"The rebate forms clearly state that they cannot be duplicated (i.e. reproductions won't be accepted). Since Amazon's chosen method of giving out the rebate forms is to let you print them yourself, that means you will be sending in a reproduction. I asked Amazon if they had discussed this with the manufacturer, and whether the manufacturer had agreed to accept the reproductions for purchases on Amazon. Amazon never contacted them, even after they received my request for information, and (at least at the time of this writing) they continue to advertise the rebates that will probably not be honored."
5,Great Machine!,"I bought this machine after having not sewn in about twenty years, and it's great! No problems what-so-over. I think this is a good machine whether you're a novice or expert."
5,Great resource,"This book is an excellent resource for learning advanced perspective techniques...though the techniques in here are not for beginners. To really understand what scott is teaching here, i would get his gnomon dvd in conjunction with this book, and between them you can learn pretty much everything you need to know about advanced perspective. This was of great help to me in learning to properly plot curved forms in space...i wince every time i see an artist that does not understand how to properly use perspective drawing, it's not hard to learn if you are willing to put the time in. This is assuredly a more advanced book though, just fair warning."
5,JJ's review,"I like this book because it helped me go through how to draw cars. I think you should get this book because if you are good at drawing cars, it will help you get better and better."
3,Wind-up clock. Needs to keep time a bit better,"Hello. I wanted to get a wind up clock and was happy to find this item. In general, you should be able to fully wind this clock and not have to wind it again for about three days. I have found the clock will sometimes stop before the three days has passed. When I go to reset the clock, it will start ticking again. It does save on electricity and batteries, of course, so that is nice. You will likely need to wind this every one or two days."
4,Neat and classic presentation,"Used the buffet server over the christmas holidays and my guests were appreciative of neat, clean and elegant presentation on the dining table. I love the fact that one can place the server on the stove top or oven till when ready to serve. I did not need to use the candles, but they sure will come in handy in the future. I have the rectangular, round and oval servers. I intend to purchase another set."
1,Only Opera CD you'll Ever Need,This CD is scrap: it is a sample CD and also the cd rom does work. When I decided to buy I did not get that information.
1,What a let down...,"I have several of ""The Only [ ] CD You'll Ever Need, and this one really sucks! The longest track is a minute, and it is just samples of opera, you can't even get into an opera before another sample is thrown your way. I did what any self respecting opera critic would have done, and threw it out."
5,"Joan of Arc,: A Spiritual Biography",This book allowed you to connect with the essence of Joan of Arc where you could feel what was going on around her. It was informative and factual and at the same time gave you a glimpse into her spirituality and the forces that drove her.I enjoyed the book very much.
3,If you are desperate to sew,"I am in a hotel and just had to have a sewing fix. Ordered this one for less than $150, it was the only one with an adjustable pressure foot-for thick lofty fabric. It is a POS BUT...if you are an experienced sewer in need of a machine on the cheap you can deal with it's quirks i.e pulling the thread out long enough to not come unthreaded each time you stop and start. It sews a decent stitch, lightweight and comes with standard accs. I would not recommned for a novice because it is a PITA to thread properly and aforementioned stuff.I also ran down to the local shop and picked up some other stuff on the cheap but it's all doable, but again you have to know what you're doing. I think it's kind of like those old car keys that are worn and you have to get the right touch/jiggle to get it to work. For the price you won't cry if it breaks. Hey a disposable sewing machine!"
1,La Crap,"Time Out London recommended this show. I saw it November 2000. Actually, I saw half of it because it was awful and I left at intermission. I no longer trust Time Out London."
3,"for david, i think that's his name","When he is taking the pictures of the girl in the photo shop, Sneaker Pimps' ""6 Underground"" is playing. It's on their album, ""Becoming X."" Portishead's ""Roads"" is playing I think when they first show the cemetary."
4,"If it doesn't have what you want, DON'T BUY IT!!","What is wrong with you people??? You people seem to buy stuff when you don't know what you're buying!! Most of the soundtrack reviews on Amazon consist of ""I didn't expect music FROM the movie"", ""I want the songs"" and the like. Do you know what an ALBUM is?? You know why they don't release band songs from movies? Because if you want the songs, you can buy the group's album(s). I'm getting so sick and tired of seeing these low scores because you people don't even know what you're buying. Same thing happened with ""The Replacement Killers"" and many more.If it doesn't have what you want, DON'T BUY IT!!"
5,Great Soundtrack!!,This is a great soundtrack!! It had really creepy and also really cool music on it. It satifies all tastes of music!! Definetly a great buy!!!
4,Song Title?,"Could anyone tell me the artist and song title of the song that the homeless girl is listening to before Keanu arrives to murder her? It sounded kind of like a toned down version of No Doubt, but I don't know what it is and I'd like to hear it again.Thanks."
2,Not Much Going On,"This wasn't what I expected. It had two videos - ""I'll Wait For You,"" and ""Tequila Makes Her Clothes Fall Off,"" but the ""acoustic performance"" of a number was completely unlike the video version, and not nearly as good - or what you expect to hear.So I guess you learn to read the fine print, and try to decipher what's on a DVD before you order it.What you think you see is not always what you get."
3,Measurements misleading,"The quality of the bakeware is fine, but I purchased this because I find the typical 9X13 pan just a bit too long for cooked lasagna noodles. 12 inches should be just right, but because the 12 inch measurement includes the handles the measurement for laying out the noodles is just 11 inches and the noodles wrap up the ends a bit. A measurement describing the interior measurement would have been more helpful."
4,A Place on Earth,"Wonderful, in-depth studies of the people in a small town and their response to the deep sorrows and blessings of life."
4,Great cooking resource,My husband and I visited NYC the year Ratner's Deli closed. We were unaware until we walked up to the door to find it had closed just before our arrival. I was very disappointed but am very glad to now have this cookbook. I am not a strict vegetarian and find the recipes in this book to be both delicious and supportive of healthy eating.
3,This wasn't for me,"This magazine was for my son-in-law. When I asked if he wanted me to renew the subscription, he said he doesn't have time to read it and likes Mother Earth News better."
3,RAY IS NOT A DJ ! ! ! !,"Now that we've gotten that straight, let's talk about the music. The song selection was okay, overall. Each song had the basic elements, learned that from DT. I could have put this cd together because I guarandamtee you Ray just picked the songs and had a crew mix them. I mean, the guy wins a VJ contest on MTV and then thinks he can put out a cd, who does he think he is, Skribble !?! Please Ray, do not put out anymore cds. Sy Yung signing off !"
4,Who should give a damn that he was a former MTV VJ?,"as for myself, i don't care what his role was on MTV. do you people hold d:fuse's past against him because he was a former new kid on the block and do you people also dislike BT for laying some beats down for n'sync? i'll bet not. so why should it matter that ray was a VJ for MTV?this CD has been in my collection of CDs for a little over a year now. i thought i'd give my opinion on this after seeing how so many people bashed this just because of ray's past.there's only one song on there that i do not care for. it's ""doom's night (timo maas remix)."" that one is pretty much loud thumping bass. yeah, it would be nice if you were in some vehicle with a loud ghetto blaster going. other than that, the track doesn't serve any purpose. i can't dance to it at all. hell, i can't even picture myself dancing to it. the rest of the tracks are nice to listen to."
4,not bad...,"Needed something small and convenient to cook stuff like burgers and chicken breats without the mess of frying them in a frying pan. I'll have to admit that those commercials bug the living bejeesus out of me, but this thing ain't all that bad. Food tastes good and cleanup is a snap. What more could you ask for?"
5,Great product!,"I hate ironing with a passion. That said, here is my review for the Jiffy 2000M.This steamer is awesome. It does the job easily and makes the task (almost) enjoyable. I think it's a great purchase. The product seems sturdy and it came well packed. I'd recommend it to everybody who hates ironing and would rather go wrinkled that have to plug the iron.It's awesome for my work pants, my silky blouses and my sweaters and t-shirts.I only take my husband's shirts to the cleaners for a starchy look but the rest of my clothes are taken care of with my new toy."
2,looks better in pictures than in real,"I returned this comforter because I expected higher quality item. The cotton material is not high quality (low thread count?), the comforter was stiff/rough (not soft), wrinkled and smelled like some chemical right out of the packaging (I did not try washing the comforter though). For the price, I would expect comforter made of soft cotton material. This is not impossible as evidenced by other sellers (even Argington or PemAmerica). The other reason why this comforter was not suitable for us were the colors. I was excited about greens, blues and reds (though reds are a bit too close to pinks as other reviewer indicated), but additional purples and black (for wheels) made this comforter too busy and cluttered.It did appear that reds and purples and blacks dominate."
2,nice phone bad display problems,This is my second phone of this type. The first one was replaced under warranty when the screen went black. 11 months later and boom it did it again. They do not extend the warranty after you've had it replaced so now I'm stuck.It's a great phone but only good for about a year before you run into problems. The camera and video features are easy to use. The speakerphone works well. The browser stuff is ok but takes a long time to connect and is hard to navigate. I'm not thrilled with saving the phone numbers to the phone itself in order to customize ringtones. It has had a good battery life and clear reception.I'd really like this phone if it'd last longer than 11 months.
3,Trance? Techno? EBM?,"Hard to categorize, yet easy to listen to. I'd call this dark rave/ dark techno also. Die Rein is full of music to bounce around while cleaning up the house, music that can also get dancefloors going.Sample filled with very little vocals, this isn't really a CD about 10 songs; rather it's about the end result. My favorite three tracks are ""Mein Erstes Bonbon"", ""The Earl"" and the uniquely titled ""Endorph-Fusion vs Reiner's Festung."".There's a sort of German exactness in the mix too. All in all a good listen; albeit one without much diversity."
4,"Nice, lively musi","I was looking for some lively swing music, and this fits the bill exactly. I only wish there were hours more of it!"
1,So So horrible,"This seemed like it was a good product since I knew many people who used it. But this stuff broke my face out!!!I think it may be too strong, lay off of this and try something mild."
1,Clock Mechanism Freezes,"You should avoid purchasing this item. The 2 Westcloxs I purchased both freezes, eventhough their springs are full. Their mechanisms start after shaking the clocks, only to freeze again after ~30 minutes."
2,You probably have it!,"If you are a fan of New Order, then you probably already have ""Bizzare Love Triangle"" re-mix in the Substance CD. The instrumental version is good but it's the same thing, just with no words. ""Shame of the Nation"" (not that good) you can find on ""The Rest Of New Order"". They should have re-re-mixed BLT, just like they did to ""Blue Monday"" and ""Toucned By The Hand Of God"". Now there's a single that I gladly paid $11 dollars for. 2 stars for the instrumental ver."
1,This game is pathetic!!!,"This game does not live up to the movie. If you have seen the movie and are expecting the fun, over-the-top sword-slashing action in the movie you will be severely disappointed. In the game your movements are short, never vary, and just don't look real. The kicks are absolutely the worst I have ever seen in a video game. The sword fighting is barely amusing for 5 minutes, and then repeats itself over and over again until you want to just kill yourself and spare the suffering. The enemy A.I. is pathetically easy, making for no more than a 3 hour game. The level design is boring, with the only puzzles involving opening doors with easily found levers. You just go from room to room killing people as you go. The levels all look basically the same, and this is the worst level design I have ever seen. This game is boring and easy. If you want a good game go for metroid prime, splinter cell, or ghost recon. The scorpion king is trash."
2,Cantina Band from Star Wars,I wanted this as I am a Star Wars Fan. But It is alittle of a let down in that it just had the two tunes (almost like a single hit CD) The seller was extremelly polite & helpful and of that I am appreciative!
3,Rent dont buy.,"Attack the Block is an average film all around. There was a lot of hype surrounding this film after it was screened on the indy circuit, but its just not a special film. The actors just do not deliver a convincing performance and the story of an alien invasion that some how goes unnoticed despite the bodies left strewn about and the bio-luminescent fangs, claws , and blood surrounding a neighborhood just is to much to swallow."
2,Vague,"When reading the book, I find it vague. Of course, it's just a college text but I need to learn from it as well. Also, I have to answer questions from the back of the chapters and I can't find the answers in the chapters AT ALL!! The people in my class get frustrated as well as myself because we have to find other resources to look for the answer when it should be referenced in our book."
3,Disappointing,"Having read and greatly enjoyed a handful of other Agatha Raisin mysteries, I was excited to find a new one. Compared to the others, though, this is a disappointment. As other reviewers have stated, the writing style is choppy and seems unprofessional. The plot is overly complicated and confusing at times, and there were so many editorial errors that I was becoming disgusted. A few I can understand, but in this book it was way out of hand! I made it through the whole book, but was really ready for it to be over near the end. I'd recommend passing on this one, and reading (or re-reading) one of the early books in this series! I'd have given it 2 1/2 stars if I could, because 3 is a bit generous."
4,A Gem within the Beaton Ouevre,"A delightful way to waste a few hours of life: highly engaging characters, sprightly dialogue, and enough murders to make any misanthrope guffaw with glee."
3,The Deadly Dance,"This is the 15th book in the Agatha Raisin series. In the first fourteen books Agatha was an amateur detective solving crimes in her Cotswold village. After she has an encounter with a pickpocket on a Paris subway, she decides to open her own private detective agency called Raisin Investigations. Most of her early cases are missing cats and teenagers. Then a client hires her to investigate death threats made to her daughter, and the plot begins to thicken. Agatha is still grappling with getting older and attributes the pain in her hip to a strain as she thinks only old people get arthritis. She also has a knack for picking unsuitable men; she even has a flirtation with the prime murder suspect. The plot gets unnecessarily complicated and is somewhat choppy, and this is not the best book in the series. However, Agatha Raisin fans will still like it."
1,Out of Date -- Doesn't Work,"First of all, there's a PCsync 2.0 which Amazon doesn't offer at this time. Secondly, if you're looking for a product to move files from an old to new computer as I was looking to do, don't bother with this product. Spend your money on a Zip drive or use your CD burner drive to transfer files. The only useful help documents are on the website, there are no manuals and the CD-based help files are of the generic ""make sure your computer is on"" variety. The USB drivers are installed, the program displays them, but can't connect them -- aaargh!"
2,Memores,i did not find it very Good. These Claim to be Re writable but I think it should not be doen more than twice since after that it is prone to errors. i cannot copy my DVDs after i did 2 rounds of recording on it
1,Memorex poor Quality mini DVD,I use these mini DVD's for work and I was very disappointed with the latest order. I ordered two packages of 10. The first package had 2 DVDS that would not format and the second package had 6 that would not format. 20% and 60% failure rate.I will not buy any more from this manufacturer and I would like to get a refund for one package.
2,Defectuoso,"Hay varios discos que me han salido defectuosos, al momento de usarlos con mi camara sony dcr-dvd205 algunos han salido malos."
5,nice quality,These worked beautifully. We used them with our Sony camcorder and couldn't imagine a better outcome. A sales person at Best Buy recommended we use only Sony Mini DVD's with our camcorder but I can't imagine any product being better quality than these.
1,Totally incompatiable with Canon DC50,I bought these as they were linked to the Canon DC50 that I bought at the same time. They do not work at all and I do not understand why they were linked with this product. Very disappointed!
3,Not impressive...,"I bought this in the hopes that I could make some yummy meals for my family that weren't loaded down with sugar or fats. I can't say this cookbook provides the best recipes for those needs. It was well organized and planned out but several of the recipes shouldn't be falling under the healthy category. Refined sugar (white) should never have a place in a health-based cookbook. That's just one of the examples. It was okay, but I'd see if your local library has if first."
5,American Dietetic Association Cooking Healthy Across America,Excellent book with plenty of recipes and nutritional background. The depth of knowledge is reminiscent of a textbook. A must have for healthy eating!
2,Not what I expected.,Did not care for this album. The melody to some of these songs is not what I expected to hear. Kinda left me flat.
2,Cheap and not great quality,"The sponge came off on first use. The sponge is harder than similar products so on insertion into the bottle neck the sponge ripped. They are a good price but honestly the more expensive ones are better quality. The small brunch is also difficult to remove from the end of the brush. It's a pity - at this price, I really wanted to like them more"
2,Not durable - Handle breaks,After a few uses the handle breaks. I have bought 2 two packs and all have broken the same way. The brush is good and the price is reasonable but it is disappointing that the handle breaks of.
2,Not for the 680,"This doesn't work with the 680. The cut outs do not fit the 680, not sure which model that it truly is for."
1,"Don't buy this, its really garbage.","This is the most hideous thing I've ever used. I got it for 10 dollars with Gran Turismo 4, and I'm upset it cost that much. If you haven't ever driven a car in your life, or been in one, this may seem sub par to you. If you drive, forget it.While driving with it, you start swerving from side to side, with no control at all. You correct it, but no, it just whips you in the other direction. I've had more fun playing with just the stock controller then this thing.And the pedals are supposed to be analogue (emphasis on supposed). With the regular controller, you have much precise control over the gas and brake functions of the car. With this its STOP GO LEFT RIGHT. THATS IT. Its a total hunk of junk.Even though I only spent ten dollars on it, I just want to let everyone know ""DO NOT BUY THIS"".Go with the more expensive Logitech Driving Force Pro. Its more expensive for a reason - *gasp* it works! Yes, it really does work!"
1,FALSE ADVERTISING: NOT JOHN WILLIAMS!,"As a lifelong John Williams and Star Wars, BEWARE!This is not the 1983 ""Lapti Nek"" music as heard in the 1983 version of the film, the 1983 original soundtrack release, and the 1993 Anthology Boxed set.This is the drivel known as ""Jedi Rocks"" that is by Jerry Hey and found in the 1997 version of the film and the 1997 release of the soundtrack. I'm sure Jerry Hey is a fine artist (I loved his song on the Rocky III), but anything that is NOT by John Williams on a Star Wars CD is uttery shameful. Shamefl of Lucas to remove the original track, and relace it with anything NOT done by John Williams.I recommend getting the 2-disc expanded sets and the 4-CD boxed set, but I don't recommend this."
5,"As with every Soltero album, this one's terrific.","This is an earlier Soltero album, but it's still a classic. From the guitar-line of ""Memorial Drive"" that slides like ice across a hot iron, to the unexpected drum machine that bursts into ""The Priest,"" to the genius lyrics of ""Communist Love Song"" that compare love to Cold War politics (""If you're ever less than certain, I will be you iron curtain, I will be your Berlin Wall, and I will never fall."" Man!) This album is the type you will have to eventually rebuy because, if you don't wear it out first, your friends will steal it from you. I'd bet at least one of the copies for sale on Amazon used to belong to me....Buy this album. Buy his latest, ""Hell Train."" Buy everything Soltero records. (...)."
4,Awesome,"My daughter enjoyed this book, but did not like how it ended. She felt a little let down at the end, but otherwise loved it."
3,Not as good as any other Goosebumps books,"When Steve put on the mask,he became an old man and started walking around,and according to what I've read,he didn't scare anybody at all(except his mom,who got scared-a little) and this book,as I've written above,just isn't as good as the other R.L Stine Goosebumps books."
5,Good CD for Fans,"This is a great CD with favorites of the park, but for hard core fans I suggest hunting down the 50th 6-disk box set! I own it and it has all these songs and more! You can listen to almost anything at the park on the box set, including rides that don't even exist anymore. If you're just a fan looking for a good, cheaper, 1 disk CD this is perfect but if you're a hard core fan that eat, sleeps, and breaths Disney I think you should find the box set! I found it at Costco.The best thing about the 6-disk set is it has the 50th fireworks show, Fantasmic, and the original Electrical Parade on it! It's truly the better CD!"
4,An Inspirating Zen master,"I choose this rating because it is interesting and well written. We learn to know about an original man, Soen Nakagawa, and it is written by an original man, Kazuaki Tanahashi.I would recommand it to anyone involved in Zen."
3,just wanted to have a wwe game,"well they have pretty good video.but when it comes to fighting its a pain,there are only a few set of moves which u can execute.it doesn't pin at times when it is supposed to.sometimes the player taps out or gets pinned barely after recieving a kick.well not a game i would like to go time and again to play."
3,Battery Dead,"I received the watch with a dead battery. Now I must return it to Tissot to get a new battery installed. Also, the watch didn't fit into the package provided. I gave this as a gift and the recipient is very disappointed he now has to return it. Who knows how long this will take."
4,"Great book, BUT....","I play violin & viola and purchased this book for a lesson plan for one of my education courses. The only ""issue"" you could say, that I have with this book is the example that is given for the viola track. 45 seconds of a concerto that makes it sound like a violin (the Bartok finale!). They could have chosen a better clip to use (like say the Telemann). haha! Maybe I'm a bit bias.The book is great with all things aside, and very informative for those that know nothing of the orchestra. It's too bad they don't list the performers on the CD! Don't let my bias deter you from purchasing this book! It's great for kids!"
5,Story of the Orchestra,"I purchased this for my grandchildren. It is an excellent review of what and who are in an orchestra, complete with a disk. My grandchildren loved it. It is geared for 7-10 year olds. My grandson is deciding what instrument he would like to play and this has helped him in his decision."
2,Maximize the Moment: God's Action Plan For Your Life,The condition of the book showed that it was worned and I was diappointed because I purchased it to give as a gift.
1,Expected More........,"When you become outside of God's Will. Things start to change. I could not feel His Spirit within this book like I had the others and I have to come believe that T.D. Jakes is just doing it for profit now. Mr. Jakes, please get back within God's Will, so He can continue to use you."
4,"Like the dancers: flawed, but likeable","Though the soundtrack brings back unpleasent(but often laughable) memories of male dancers that should have never taken to the stage and sounds like the kind of music that Canada is just now breaking into, this soundtrack is nonetheless enjoyable to listen to."
2,"Nice Try, But I'm Looking For Quality","While the poems aren't particularly well-written, my students did enjoy the few I read to them. I teach 2nd and 3rd graders and my team is working on finding songs, chants, and poems that correspond with state standards and our goals for the year. This book didn't have a lot to offer for that purpose. The poems are long and wordy. I am returning the book because I just don't think I'll use it enough. It's not something I would just add to my classroom library either because I'm not sure it would last long. There are small pictures worked into the text of the poem, but they aren't particularly exciting or interesting. The book is spiral bound, and not particularly well-constructed. I got a large chunk of the book twice, which made me wonder if I was also missing anything. I'm glad that someone is doing this -trying to engage students in math with poetry, but I hope that as more people do it the overall quality available will also improve."
4,Keep it organized and easy to reach!,We purchased this to put in the bathroom under the sink. Slides easy to reach the what you'll have stored in the back. If putting this under a sink! Be careful when measuring. Make sure you account for where the water line comes out and the height of the basket. This was very easy to install 5 minutes!
5,The best qigong dvd that I've seen,"This DVD clearly instructs you how to do the exercises, and it gives you an idea of how to connect with the energy movement involved. Some of the exercises take awhile to connect with, but they feel like the real thing when you do.I've been working with DVDs for almost two years now. This is the best that I've seen so far. Not a bad price, either."
1,"Not good,,,,","Well like the others say, this is only good if you want to get use to the controls, you don't have a choice when casting, and as far as the reeling in goes, wait until the tension gets in the lt blue area before you reel in then there won't be so many breaks, but i wouldn't recommend this to anyone, has alot of challenges, quizez for new places to fish and lures, but the fishing part is boring. ZZZZzzzzZZZ..save your money"
1,What a waste...,"This book isn't worth the paper it's printed on. And all because it says: ""for Experienced Programmers""... To clear it up: It's really a beginners guide! The first chapters explain what Delphi is. Then it tells what every menu-item in the IDE does. It explains some things about the Delphi types.If you're a beginner with Delphi and you've lost the original manual, then consider purchasing this book. Otherwise, it's just a waste of your money."
1,ok if free...,"The Kindle version of this book is filled with misspelled words, typos, words running together and words missing. It is good information for a free ebook, but I would have been very upset had I paid for it."
3,"great sound, not great fit for me...","these headphones sound great - i have had 2 pairs of the e2c's and love the crap out of them; problem here is totally personal fit; no matter what i do, i can't get them to stay in my ears very well. i've tried all the different size buds but to no avail; these phones are a little smaller than the 2's and i guess i have ears that are too big...again, phones sound great."
1,Lack of bass,I decided to buy Shure E4 because lots of high review results.However I totally disappointed by it's sound.There was no bass at all.I couldn't enjoy this less than ipod stock headphone sound.I returned E4 then bought Super.fi 5 Pro.It's so much better! Now I'm happy.
4,Definitely take some getting used to,The sound on these headphones is fantastic. I've heard instruments in some of my favorite songs I didnt know were there. The hard part is figuring out which ear sleeve to use. It takes a while to get used to all of the various styles because they go deeper into the canal than the iPod or other headphones do. I would say try out all of the sizes that come with the headphones before buying replacements.
3,"Great sound, not meant to last","Excellent sound, none better in my opinion, and I'm proud of my ""golden ears"". However, after 2 years and 3 months of service..... That's 3 months out of warranty, mind you, the left cabling started to fray right below the earphone. Oh well, back to my sturdy E3c...."
1,Terrible,I bought this to cut my husband's thick hair and it did not work at all. His hair kept getting caught in the blades and I had to return this item. I am very disappointed.
4,Grossman and Hackady at their best!,"A delightful score by the under-rated Grossman and Hackady (MINNIE'S BOYS). Compelling story from an historical viewpoint, Ann Reinking as Joan of Ark and Joel Grey as Charlie are a great pairing.This CD is a must for collectors of Broadway shows."
2,Really like the bag--but not the finish and strap,"I have had a Domke F-5xb for a few years and really like it. I then got this bag, but really did not like the waxwear and color used for the strap and body strips. I couldn't care less about how it looks, but the strap and strips (in this light color) are far too prone to dirt and dust and the like. And making it worse is the waxwear finish, which you need to care for regularly and are not supposed to machine wash! So this bad has a strap and strips that are far more prone to dirt than my olive canvas F-5xb, but you're supposed to hand wash it. I don't have the time for that, so I sold this bag without using it much.That said, I do like the overall structure and layout of the bag--just not the finish and strap and strips."
1,TROUBLING,"What's troubling about this novel isn't the story (which begins with sinister potential). It's how the writer, inexplicably, changes course and takes the reader down a path impossible to negotiate. While I don't appreciate the spiteful tone of some of the other reviewers here (we are supposed to be book ""lovers,"" people), I have to say this book is not deserving of a favorable mention."
2,"Deliberately Obtuse; Should just be called ""Ordinary""","I was very much looking forward to this book--it sounded so good. But as I read--and waited for something to happen--it became apparent I had made a poor choice. Nothing ever did happen. If I am wrong and something did, it was on pages my book was missing. Though it opens up the door for questions on my intelligence (go ahead, I am secure in my mental capabilities) I must say that I am not sure *what happened* in this book. I actually went online to see what others' takes were on it, to make my reading seem less like a waste of time. Instead of a plot the writer seemed to attempt to write of things quotidian--and try to make them sinister. I would read parts over to see what word I had missed that would explain the sequence--but there was nothing. Utterly incomprehensible. Someone earlier wrote--in the course of praising the book!--that he did not remember the book well. That would be because there was nothing to remember."
5,Great product!,"Really nice product. I bought it on sale on toys'r us for $49.95. Cudos to the developers. Yes, the screen is tiny, but so what. I opened the xbox and soldered the power wire into the box, so I didn't need an extra adapter. Now I can use it in my car (12v-220v converter in the car) and in my cabin etc. Kids love it. The sound is acceptable, and 2 headphone jacks is nice. So, since my xbox is modified, I now have a fully portable dvd player/media center/music box, gamebox in one package ready to go anywhere. Now I will buy the 7"" screen version, should look even nicer."
1,You Can Use A Portable DVD Player!!!,"I have a 7"" portable DVD player and I have it hooked up in my truck. The key to buying a portable DVD player is that you must buy one that has the option to accept video input. Then you goto Walmart or Radio Shack and buy three female-to-female RCA connectors. BANG... you have a portable DVD player and a Screen. You can now hook up anything that has RCA connectors: Sat., Cable, VCR, Gamecube, PS2, etc..."
3,Great information but you can't read the illustrations on a Kindle,"I like this book because it explains the science of distilling better than most. There is, however, no way to zoom in on the very small illustrations. I would give it a 5 if I could read the text on the still fabrication drawings."
2,The low carb baking and Dessert Review,Imagine my surprise when this cookbook came up on a reduced price list. I bought it with the hopes that I would get some new ideas.. that was not the case. I found it not very interesting and I won't make any of the recipes.
5,I love this case.,"I use this to travel with my console systems. Like this one so much, I bought one for my xbox and Gamecube. Box up the system and throw it in the trunk great for traveling."
2,Review,"All i can say is the movie was bad, and the score was bad. There was only a few good parts in this CD the rest were bad very bad. I do not recommend this CD to anyone but if you are a fan of the Alien movies i would recommend that you buy the score to Aliens."
1,Horrible!,"I've heard almost all of the versions of Symphonie Fantastique, and this one was probably the worst. I've heard middle school bands that have better brass sections than this orchestra. The entire Boston brass section on this recording is horrible - especially the low brass. The percussion is not together witht he rest of the ensemble, and there are really strange sounds coming from the timpani. I don't know what people are hearing to rate this any higher. If you want to get a good performance matched with great recording quality, then get the version done by Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony. That's the best version out there right now."
3,[Interesting] and short but lacking character development,"This story was a quick, [Interesting] little read but, because Kimberly Raye's Midnight Kisses was one of my all-time favorite funny reads, I guess I was expecting a little more. More humor and better character development. Maybe it was the short format? I'm not sure but I quickly tired of all of the agonizing over ""reputations"" and ""haves"" & ""have nots"". These two seemed way too hung up on their high school days. Or maybe I'm just a grouch (which is more than likely the case!). Still, it was easy to read and Brady was a pleasing hero what with the renting of Mickey Rourke videos to spice things up :)"
4,Terrific soul singer,"I bought this 2-CD set in a shop about 10 years ago and still play it often. There are other Laura Lee compilations out there, so I can't guarantee that this is the best one, but it's mighty, mighty good. Disc 1 has 20 tracks and Disc 2 has 9 tracks, so that's 29 (not 31, as one Amazon stat tells you). Laura Lee enjoyed some fairly big R&B and Pop hits in the early 70s with songs like ""Woman's Love Rights"" and ""Rip Off"" (both of which are on here), but she was more than a mainstream vocalist. She had a sassy, southern soul style that reminds me a bit of Candi Staton at times. She also recorded many excellent tracks for the Invictus label (""Crumbs off the Table"", ""Don't Leave me Starving ..."" etc.), and those are included here too. This compilation is a very worthwhile one for any fan of 60s and 70s soul music, especially those that enjoy female vocalists. Laura Lee remains an underrated artist from the those glorious 70s soul days. Listen to this and discover some magical tunes."
1,if you like synethesia you'll love this...,"this is a lackluster album by summers. If you love golden wire, world gone strange and summer of the early stuff like collaborations with fripp and xyz you won't find that quality here."
4,Good Solid Song,"another good track from the elements.a cool track from Earth,Wind&Fire.Good Solid Vocals&Music."
3,WWF In Your House 23: Fully Loaded 1998 Review,"This was an ok event with a nice undercard and a not so great main event. First of all, it should have been Austin putting his title on the against somebody instead of him and The Undertaker winning the tag team title. But they made the best of a bad situation and put together a fine pay per view with an excellent Intercontinental Title match. Oh yeah, the bikini contest was the best part of the show- no doubt!"
5,The Very Best,"I have two copies of the book and a copy of the cassette tapes. We have homes for developmentally disabled and mentally ill adults. We have raised three sons, also. The clear, concise command that the author demonstrates is useful in EVERYONE'S daily life...In dealing with the telephone solicitor, one's spouse, or one's child. We listen to the tapes every year or so for a refresher and deal with the world more effectively afterwards. Get the book, read it, and get back into the position of being a parent instead of a victim of your own offspring, for God's sake."
5,This works!,"This book opens a parent's eyes to just how lazy we can be. Gaining our children's respect for our authority as parents requires effort, especially if that effort was not put forth when they were young. Bodenhamer shows us how to do it, and lets us know that if we are unwilling to put forth that effort our children are the ones IN CONTROL. My children were in control after my divorce, until my sister (bless her) gave me a copy of this book. It took lots of effort, I was late for work many times for a couple of weeks, some of the ""fun"" things I liked to do were missed. However, in about four weeks life with my children became amazingly wonderful! This book not only changed my children's lives it changed mine. Over the past six years I have purchased at least six copies of this book and given them to friends, including new parents with the recomendation that if they follow Bodenhamer's guidelines NOW their children will not only love them but will RESPECT them for the rest of their lives."
1,wrong guitar/damaged,Not only did they send the wrong guitar it was damaged on their end. They tried to spot paint it to hide the damage. The paint that was used did not match. I did not have good luck with their customer service. I was not a happy buyer to say the least.
3,Could be better,"The guitar itself is a good starter for an inexperienced player, but the case is 100% cheap and the plastic zipper broke the first day. Accessories seem fine, amp is adequate. Would order a separate guitar case though if trying to impress someone... Seems to go out of tune easily. My 15 yr. old son received it for Christmas so we have had ample time to give it a chance."
5,PLEASE READ!!!!!,"LET ME JUST START BY SAYING THAT THIS IS A VERY WELL MADE ELECTRIC GUITAR FOR THE PRICE, IT HAS A SOLID BODY AND IT SOUNDS GREAT. THE AMP IS GOOD QUALITY TOO AND I LOVE THAT IT COMES WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO GET STARTED--- PICKS,AMP,EXTRA SET OF STRINGS, AND ALL THE CORDS. THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT FOR ANYBODY, THE SELLER WAS FANTASTIC TOO."
4,Great starter guitar!,Bought this for my 11 year old son who just started guitar lessons - it is beautiful and he thinks it rocks! It is a nice all-inclusive kit that was perfect to get started. The only thing it didn't come with is a tuner. I thought the amp would be bulky and was impressed wtih how slim and sleek it is. We love it.
4,great company,"i ordered this thinking i was ordering a bass. don't know why or how i made this mistake but austin bazaar was really cool about it. i sent it back and they immediately sent me the bass i was trying to purchase. although i did inquire with them about a purple bass and they said they would send it in purple, they ended up sending it in blue which is fair considering that's the original color that i purchased the guitar in. all in all i am happy with my purchase. now i just need to learn how to play. will definitely use this company again."
1,POOR product,"This product was unusable when arrived. I ordered it as Xmas present using 2-Day shipping, and didn't receive it until a week and a half after New Years. Packaging of the product was not sufficient. The nut for the top two strings weren't aligned and made the string rest on the first fret making the guitar un-tunable. The neck was warped and needs alignment. There was a Big ding on the guitar it's self. All in all I was Very Unhappy with this product but due to the being a present and the lateness of to shipping, I kept it. Overall POOR product, choose another guitar!!!!!"
4,Great Bag!,"I saw this bag in CompUSA for about $60 and decided to order it from Amazon for $20 cheaper. Its a great durbale bag. Perfect fit for my 14.1"" PC. Originally I didn't want another black bag, but its cool because it has hot pink trimming and its hot pink on the inside too. You can carry it with or without the shoulder strap. It doesn't leave MUCH room for the power cord or external mouse, but I can still fit it in there. Overall its a great buy! I don't think you'd be disappointed. But I'd recommend this for someone like a high school or college student (like myself), Not someone who goes to an office with many files and misc things to carry."
5,LADO B LADO A LADO A LADO B,"Lado b lado a is one of the best albuns from the brazilian rock music. They also mix reggae and hip hop in their sound, making a very cool music. I really recomend ALL the stuff from O RAPPA to anyone who likes reggae and rock."
4,A Sound Argument Supporting the Uniqueness of the Christian Story,"I appreciate Girard's willingness to grapple with the reality of myths and stories outside of the Christian story in order to pursue truth. In pursuing truth, he is led to confirm the uniqueness of the Christian story and posit once again why the Christian story is the hope of all peoples, of all nations, everywhere!"
2,DIDNT LIKE IT,"Its not that good of a movie, maybe for watching one time. Didnt like the storyline, actors are ok. Ive seen better movies."
1,Yuck!,"NASTY! Rob Morretti directed an autobiographical movie about a slimy actor turned drama coach who seduces one of his teenage students, leading the boy into a dark world of sex and drugs. In a twisted move, Morretti, who in real life was the student, plays the teacher in the film. With the possible exception of the teacher's friend and sort-of conscience, there is not a single likeable or sympathetic character in sight. The production values are bad, the acting pretty awful, the writing is trite. Perhaps the film provided therapy for the director, but I can't imagine any other reason for its existence.Don't make the mistake of buying this movie, like I did. Don't even bother to rent it, or watch it for free at a friend's house. It isn't worth the time. All you'll get from watching it is a bad taste in your mouth. Avoid at all cost!"
3,Pretty good deal,"Bought this for a trip to Hawaii this past summer. Downside: It gets lots of attention by the baggage screeners at the airport, so if you carry it on, prepare to be delayed. I had it checked with our other bags for an inter-island flight, and it survived okay, except for one velco strap broken."
2,"Movie is fine, DVD is lacking","The DVD features the movie in a poor NTSC to PAL conversion. The movie is shown in 2.35:1 widescreen, but it is not 16x9 enhanced for widescreen TVs."
1,NEVER WORKED,My machine wouldnt recognize the card. Total waste of my money. I have the new slim PSTwo machine... I DO NOT recommend this to anyone. Do yourself a favor and just buy the regular memory cards.
1,Lost Everything!!!,"I found this thing easy to use. The problem was that it wouldn't work while I was playing Ratchet and Clank: UYA. I'd jiggle it around in the memory slot, and it would work work. Then one time jiggling it didn't work. It hasn't worked with anything else either. I lost ALOT of saves. I want my money back!"
5,Best cleaning and scented!!,"This is the most awesome detergent on the market for HE washers. It smells great and cleans great. I can't find it anywhere in stores, only Tide, which I don't care for the scent. Please keep this product available!!!!!"
2,Not one of our favorites....,"This book has never been one of our favorites. I used it when my boys were little (they are now 17 & 15) to go along with the Five In A Row curriculum. Now I have a 5 year old daughter and am still using FIAR curriculum, and this still isn't a favorite book. We just don't care for the story. For the most part, we all found it very uninteresting.Granted, there are a lot of things that can be pulled out of the book that are of value educationally, but to consider this book a classic, or a 'must read' in our family, is just not possible. We make books our friends and we love almost all the other books on the FIAR lists. This one just didn't quite hit the mark."
5,Mega set !,"Very large boxset ! Much bigger than I thought it would be, I knew there is a lot of disc's in this set but I figured the box would be the standard dvd size box set maybe a little larger in thicness, but wow was i surprised by the actual size in length to . So this will be going on the shelve that houses all the other odd ball size boxsets, This is a very good deal, don't let this one get by you !"
3,After about 6 months,"After initially deciding this product was awesome. I've decided to revise my initial estimate. Its pretty bad actually, but for the price if pretty good. It was one of the best things out 6 months ago but I wish I waited 1 month for the sonic blue product. Upgradable firmware, backlit, quick startup time, all things this product is missing. Ack."
4,pretty good,"i like it. after reading all of the not-so-good reviews, i bought this player, and it's just about exactly what i expected. all i wanted was a nice cd player that would play CD-RWs, and that's what this can do. the one thing that's annoying me is where is the hold switch? i don't think it's mentioned in the manuel, and i can't seem to find it, but it says here on the technical info that there is one. if you could tell me, please post it here or email me at HotelDetective11@aol.com thanks! anyway, i really like it, and if you don't want an absolutely perfect player, but just one that plays RWs and such, then get it, definitely."
2,Piece of Junk,"It worked fine when I first got it. However, it's only been 1 month and the headphones are broken and it skips and cuts out when I play a cd. I didn't drop it or damage it. It's just a piece of junk. Next time I'll spend more money and buy a quality made cd player."
2,"Good for the price, but not nearly good enough","I bought mine for 79.99 at Target, kept it 3 weeks, and returned it. The fact that it is limited to only 200 songs is a major drawback, since I can fit three times that amount on a CD. There was no limit listed anywhere on the package, manual, or online. That was bad enough, but there was a disturbing glith in the audio every 30 seconds or so, on both MP3's and CDs (even store bought). I don't know if it was just a problem with that individual unit, or if all are prone to such. Ultimately, I would rather pay more and get more."
4,"Its GREAT, Buy It","This is a great mp3/cd player. But it is kind of picky on how you burn the mp3 cds. After lots of trys with a CD-RW disk, I fianlly figured it out. Using NERO I burned it like this:Multisession setting: *Start Multisession disk* Name length setting: ISO level 2 Format: Mode 1 Character Ste: ISO 9660 Joliet: *OFF* Dates: use date and time from original file Be sure to fianalize CD **Use 128k or lower mp3s or you will have tons of skipping.** This works on CD-RW disks and it should work on CD-R disks, but I haven't tested on the CD-R.The only reason I didn't give it the fifth star was because it can be very hard to get your CD burned correctly and the manual is VERY bad. Every thing else is VERY GOOD."
1,It is illegal to sell something this bad,"I own an MP3 player which I bought here (Nomad II) loved it but too little memory. I bought the Memorex Cd/Mp3 player because I have lots of MP3-CD's. It did everything like chug alot and display stupid typographical symbols but did not play music. It skipped and it skipped and it skipped, which is what I should have done when I glanced by it at the counter. It goes back tommorow. Don't let the cheap price and the added accessories fool you. It is a real piece of #$%)@!"
2,It's Cheap but Disappointing,"The Memorex MP3/CD Player seemed to be a bargain at less than $100, but I'm afraid it didn't measure up to my expectations. It refused to play my mp3 files satisfactorily. In some cases it did not recognize some folders and songs at all. Almost all of the songs had skips and loud errors. Some songs would stop in the middle and refuse to continue until the fast forward button was pressed to skip over the defective section. And finally, the quality of the sound was not up to par. The same songs played on my Rio PMPs 300 were fabulous by comparison. All the songs that refused to play well on the Memorex played perfectly on my computer. Overall the unit was a big disappointment."
3,Could be so much better,"They claim that it has 45sec's of regular CD anti-shock and 105sec's of mp3 anti-shock. The unit plays regular cd's perfectly, constantly spining the CD keeping the memory full. While the MP3 function spins the CD untill the memory is completely filled with 105 seconds of MP3 music then STOPS the CD causing the memory to run out except for 3 seconds before it starts to spin the CD again. If the lens cannot find it's place within 3 seconds due to the slightest vibration or scratch, the player will skip or pause. This problem can be easily fixxed by giving the lens 10 or 15 seconds to find its place instead of 3. It will only sacrafice a small porton of battery life but it would be worth it."
3,"Decent for the money, but not good enough","I purchased the Memorex 8505 after reading several rave reviews and also received a Genica MP3 cd player for christmas. I much prefer the ID3 Tags and directory searching in the Memorex, but the player lacks the ability to play mp3's as well as it should. I have been successful in playing a 256kbps MP3 cd with no problems, but still do get the drop outs every 10-20 min, which is rather annoying. It tends to stop playing on VBR's in the middle also and skipped on occasion with a CD-R. The genica doesn't seem to have much problem with vbr's but is limited to it's 192kbps max nor hav I experienced drop outs. Overall I think I'm going to return the Memorex and hope they improve their product as it is a fine start for a wonderful product the value with the car kit almost is making me consider keeping it, but I think I should hold out for the next revision."
2,Good Idea - Poor Implementation,"When I saw this unit advertised on Amazon I thought ""great price"" for a MP3/CD player. Unfortunately, the unit did not live up to my expectations. It is heavier and bulkier then it needs to be, and the construction seems flimsy. The MP3 functionality is extremely picky in terms of files and CD's that it will read. First I thought it was me, but after reading other people's experiences I realized it was the unit. Manual is worthless, and the manufacturers web site offered no help. I returned the player and invested a little more in the Sonicblue Rio Volt. Boy am I happy I did! The unit does everything the Memorex could not, even the sound was better. It's true - you get what you pay for!!"
2,"It was so-so inside, but failed the car test.","The MPD8505CP seemed to work OK when I tested it inside, albeit with a few skips here and there. Unfortunately, when I tried it in the car the skips grew much more frequent. Even during smooth highway driving I could expect a skip in almost every song. Inclines in the road seemed to cause the player even more problems. I might have kept it if I was planning to use it in the house instead of the car, but I returned it since car performance was my main concern. The MPD8505CP soured me on CD-based MP3 players, so I decided to go with the Nomad Jukebox instead. The Nomad Jukebox isn't that much more expensive than the better CD-based MP3 players anyway."
4,"Great for the price, much better than earlier makes/models","I've read some of the Memorex 8505 reviews and conclude that the ones having trouble have either the initial release of the player (no Suffix A to indicate the firmware revision), somewhat quirky CD burning or both. It's probably mostly the Memorex player fault. Our Suffix A revision has been used all week, with mostly 160 Kbps MP3s and has worked fine. The controls aren't hard. It's more like a 'button, button who's got the button' kind of annoyance. After all, they are mostly for search, which most of the alternative players can't even do. Anyway, get the latest revision and you should be happy like we are."
5,Excellent piece of hardware!,"I bought this player for my car, so I was pleased to find it came with a car adapter! I burned a CD and took it to my car... hmm, lots of skipping... I then bought a CD-RW for another one of my computers so I could keep making new CDs without wasting CD-RsIt turns out that the anti-skip is nearly bullet proof when it comes to the CD-RWs I bought at Office Depot.It appears that the media you use for writing your CDs influences how well the anti-skip protection will work.The interface is certainly different with the circle of buttons but I'm used to it such that I can actually change directories and songs without looking... which is useful while driving!A note about the bullet-proof anti-skipping... towards the end of a CD-RW the song starts, hiccups, then continues on perfectly without any skipping from that point. Just an interesting observation."
1,How did it ever make it to the market?,"I am absolutely disappointed with every aspect of this player. I am an engineer myself, and I agree with other reviewers that Memorex skip the testing phase of the design process. This unit is FULL of engineering flaws... What MP3 player can't support >128kps, or VBR??? I am more curious to know how Memorex designed the button-layout of this unit, did some just randomly picked out the position where each button goes? They are not friendly at all. This unit skips more often than a $15 cheap CD player, not because someone bumped it, but because of hardware/software bugs. And what a battery eater, a fresh set of Duracell Ultras, runs only about 3.5 - 4 hrs... My Panasonic CD player last 6 to 7 times longer on a same set of battery. This unit looks cheap, cost cheap, and performs cheap as well... I guess you do get what you pay for. I'd stick with my solid-state MP3 players for now!"
3,Did anyone bother to proofread or copyedit this book?,"The experience of reading Baudrillard always involves masochism and requires a sense of humor, but this manuscript went to print in an appalling state. These are not items lost in translation, but periods in the place of commas, 'out' used instead of 'our', things being 'curcumscribed' etc. - Things that undermine the text every five or six pages. This book has been distributed by MIT since the early 1980s and its amazing that it went to print in this state, and that no one has corrected the text."
2,An Essay Masquerading As A Book: Annoyed Me!,"My Rating: 2 starsBrief Summary: This 48-page book (half of which are photos!) is an essay on why we should all give up the burden of perfectionism.Brief Thoughts (But Really A Rant): I can't even begin to tell you how annoyed I am that this ""book"" is being sold for $12.95 ($17.95 in Canada). And this isn't even Quindlen's first offense of this nature!!! She did the same thing with A Short Guide to A Happy Life (with the emphasis being on ""short""). There is nothing in here you can't find somewhere else for considerably less money or for free. I literally read the entire book while eating lunch! I used to like Quindlen, but think her writing has gone steadily downhill. (I thought her novel Rise and Shine was horrible. But at least you got over 200 pages!) This feels like a popular author doing a money grab, and I, for one, am annoyed by it."
2,Entire book could be written in one paragraph,"Charging $12.95 for a 64-page book that is essentially a commencement speech sprinkled with photos from the Fifties seems the ultimate in chutzpah. Although I love Anna Quindlen's columns and novels, this book warning about the displeasures of perfection is not worthy of hardcover treatment -- it should be one in a collection of essays. There is nothing here that has not not been said before, many times before by others, some even more eloquent than Quindlen. Save yor money and read the amazon.com reviews -- you'll get the entire gist and more from those."
2,Possibly a great product,"Seems like a great product. Be aware that this product is useless without one of the Lowepro Waistbelts. Also be aware that unless you are VERY familiar with how web gear works, getting this thing set up is going to cause you a seemingly endless amount of frustration. The picture is misleading - it doesn't snug up tight like it shows, and getting everything together is a huge pain. Don't think you're going to use this part-time, either. Getting it all snugged up takes a fair amount of effort. Be prepared to buy two complete setups (this one plus a more traditional bag setup) if you don't think you're going to be wearing this full time.I think this has potential to be a terrific product, and that Lowepro blew it by deciding to not include any sort of usable or useful instructions."
4,Satisfied,This CD showed me a lot of songs I did not know or had forgotten -- plus the three or so big hits. I like it. I'm glad I made the purchase.
3,Sound Reproduction,"Ordered this in November of 2008, just around to listening to it.Lot's of great songs from yesteryear. Only problem - my CD is very ""fuzzy"" on more than a few songs - i.e. there is a good bit of distortion especially when the group cranks up the volume in the higher registers. Too bad."
5,As Elegant as the Cadillac. . .,"Like so many, I grew up listening to the Fleetwoods. They are unique--no mistaking these harmonies for anyone else. For most of us these are familiar songs, so I'll focus on the CD. First, sound quality is as perfect as I'd want. I'm a car listener and this collection sounds so very good there. However, at least as stellar is the liner notes. The photo shown covers a quite comprehensive bio of the group covering many pages.Additionally, it's fun to get the 'a capella' versions of 'Come Softly' and 'Mr. Blue' as well as a radio plug for a DJ.This CD is a bargain and a keeper for all Fleetwoods fans."
1,Written by a rabid Democrat.,"Interesting story; could have been a good story. Had to put it down due to the author picturing all the ""bad"" officers as Republicans and all the ""good"" authors as Democrats. Mr. Truscott lets his political prejudice ruin an otherwise pretty good story."
3,Good story but predictable.,"Truscott did a good job of describing today's Army which is 180 degrees different than the Army he talked about in ""Dress Gray."" The story, however, was too predictable to suit me and the characters were pretty one dimensional. Gen Gibson was bad through and through with no redeeming qualities whereas Ry Slaight was 100% good. Not an accurate portrayal of how people really are.Having worked for the Army as a civilian for 15 years, I can only wish that the Army leadership was as progressive as Truscott's LTG Slaight and the CSA. We still have a long way to go."
1,so bad I returned the book,"I bought this book while stationed in Korea. I enjoyed reading ""Dress Gray"" while I was a cadet and I was excited to see that Truscott had written a sequel. I read the entire book, but ended up being so disappointed that I took it back to the bookstore and got my money back. I am tired of books that insinuate that women at a mostly male school equals a scandal. See also, ""A General's Daughter."" Hey guess what--I was a female cadet in my opinion and West Point isn't some mysterious old boy network where crimes get shoved under the rug--it goes completely against the principles that the academy stands for.Don't waste your time on this one!"
1,A TERRIBLE BOOK YOU WONT LEARN A THING,"This is not a book. This is a PR pamphlet that costs $20.00!!! The author made a lot of money. Great. But do you really want to spend $20.00 to hear him tell you over and over again:He is brilliant. he is clever.He never tells you his methods or his insights other than how wonderful he is. The book is simplistic drivle that is not even worthy of a 2 inch mention in a free newspaper. Badly written, u8nintersting and incredibly uninformative. I can only imagine the size of the mirrors in his office!!!DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU WANT TO LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT REAL ESTATE.BUY DONALD TRUMPS STUFF.BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Good Deals with Good Guys,"In April 2004, I met Steven Good and heard him speak about his business and his book. One of his pithy thoughts, which I've repeated, is that ""you can't do a good deal with a bad guy."" In his book, he gives real examples of relationships and creative deals. As a patent attorney, I work with intellectual property more than real property and I find that Good's book is as valuable for good ideas as it is for facts about buildings and land."
4,Similarities,"if your looking for something to compare this album to, it sounds like a slighty cheerier version of Braid's early years with the occasional tuba. if you like one, check out the other, and while your at it, period."
4,"Very good, but one odd control","Bought this for my wife before Christmas. It's very good at what it does. It feels sturdy in the hand, and the adjustable speed control is great. My only ding against it is that there's no way to keep the power running except to hold in the power switch. The switch is long and designed to comfortably be operated by hands of any size; but instead of clicking on and off when you press it, you have to hold the switch in by clenching your hand to keep it running. When you're taking a minute or more to puree a soup, for instance, that gets very tiring. It seems like an unnecessary design flaw; it could just as easily toggle on/off using the same switch. I hope that will be recognized and changed in the future. Other than that, it's great."
1,defective,"I am in the process of returning my third one. Each one failed when I was blending soup. The handle got extremely hot, then if I turned it off, the unit was dead, wouldn't turn back on. With the 2nd and 3rd units, they failed the FIRST time I used them. Customer service was great, they replaced each one without a fuss, but this time I give up. Just getting my money back."
1,Does not stand test of time,"Sadly, the blender attachment does not stand the test of time. We have used this blender on an average of 5-6 times a month over the course of the year as it was purchased in November 2008 and given as a Christmas gift. Now the blender blade will no longer turn when attached to the motor. The part on the motor handle that grips the end of the blade and should hold on to it so that it turns has degraded. The food processor still works for now. It should be able to handle making smoothies or pureeing veggie soups for longer than one year, it's not as if we tried to mix concrete with it. Needless to say, we are extremely disappointed in KitchenAids quality on this product and cannot recommend it to anyone who wants a small appliance to last longer than 1 year."
3,Down and Dirty Vietnam,"I did like this book. It is not one of the best gonzo travelogues that I've read, but it made its mark for a number of reasons:-Karin did most of the travel on her own - I think that a woman traveling alone has more fears to confront than a man, and in this case, she handles them extremely well;-She went native - eating the food her hosts ate, sleeping in their huts, suffering the same parasites, and learning their language;-She kept her sense of humor;And most importantly, her writing style was very ""approachable"" and fresh - a style which mirrors the subject of her affection (Vietnam) well."
3,Seven Months in Vietnam,"Usually I read customer reviews after I've read the book. This being the case w/ Hitchhiking Vietnam, I am surprised by the strongly held negative reviews by some (many!) readers. With or without Jay, she was pretty much ""solo."" And whatta adventure! Not one I'd like to experience, but lots of fun to read about on a rainy California afternoon. I liked Karen and found her revelations honest and modest. I'd read her latest book on the Incas. If you like travel books, read Hitchhiking. But don't pay attention to the cover. Actually, it makes no sense!"
1,A Well Executed Fraud,"How can anyone who has read the book not be amused at these reviews lauding her as a ""strong woman?"" She spends most of the narrative begging men to babysit her around Vietnam and when they inevitably tire of her company, she pouts like a petulant little girl. Muller's increasing sense of ""ownership"" of the country over the course of the travelogue reaches its nauseating nadir when she subjects the Northern Hill Tribes to her gawking false commiseration; she too knows what it is too suffer: you see, that selfish Jay decided to pursue his own vacation rather than act as her own personal rickshaw driver. What a foul piece of self-aggrandizing fiction; nicely targeted at the Oprah Book of The Month Club dimwits. Let me suggest Devla Murphy to you if you'd like to read a travelogue from a woman with guts.I heartily recommend Catfish & Mandala if you'd like a sense of contemporary Vietnamese culture."
1,"sad, sad egomaniac","I saw Karen at a reading years ago in SF when she was promoting this book. She could not speak Viet at all other than a few simple words. She made several inaccurate comments that made many Vietnamese Americans in attendance look at each other in puzzlement, but everyone was too polite to point out her errors to her. One of the commments was about how a truck driver's salary was less than the cost of postage of her letter to the US! Oh, my God! The woman has no idea what she was talking about at all. I didn't bother to read her book for years after that, but one day I found myself with time to spare and with only her book on the shelf at a friend's house.Dull layman writing with plenty of offensive conjectures.Actually, I don't blame Karen for writing the book. Everyone is entitled to her opinion regardless of faults. I do blame her publishers and editors for not knowing better, for not fact checking.Hopefully, this book will just vanish in time."
3,A very raw but promising first novel...,"It should come as no surprise that Rosenfelt is a former Hollywood marketing executive. If this book were a movie (and it does read like a typical screenplay) it would be a solid ""rental,"" two and half stars. The book is about as deep as my finger nail, but the story flies by. Andy is a good guy. You can't help but like him. For that reason, I will probably read more of the Andy Carpenter books. The disappointing thing is, of course, the lack of depth. I hoping that Rosenfelt grows a novelist. Because Carpenter is worth keeping around."
4,Short novel and easy to read,Just about right for a good novel with suspenseful plot. Good start for author's debut. I noticed the author wrote Andy Carpenter's sarcastic and smart aleck dialogue is almost similiar to Robert Parker's Spenser.
3,Colors don't match - material isn't the quality I would expect for price,"The pattern is definitely cute. However, the comforter colors were a bit bolder than the bumper, which made it harder for me to match drapes. I didn't like the material used on the comforter, but I haven't washed it yet, it also has a funny industrial smell to it. I am hoping it will get softer for my newborn to the touch by washing it repeatedly prior to her arrival. I would have expected to pay much less for this kind of quality. I had bought my son's crib set from Pottery Barn Kids and paid less and was much happier with the quality."
5,Great gift for daddy,"I bought this frame for my husband for his first fathers day. I put a pic of him sleeping in the chair holding the twins, their first night home. When i seen that frame and read the poem, i knew that pic would go perfect in the frame. It hangs up nicely and the pic are easy to get in. The color of the frame is nice and doesnt look cheap. Since my husband is a cop he sometimes puts in long hours. And he said he looks at that picture often!"
4,Get your Stereolab fix while waiting for their next,"If you like Stereolab then you should probably like this CD too. The musical style is very similar and features Stereolab's vocalist, but this disc lacks the dynamic range and glossy production of a Stereolab CD. The tracks feel more like parts of a whole, not distinct songs per se- sort of like a musical collage. It's not really what I would call beautiful, but the overall sound is appealing though a bit limited in scope. Sadier is joined by another vocalist Marie Merlet who I wouldn't mind hearing on the next Sterolab CD- she has a very distinct baby-doll quality. I would say that with this CD the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts, working best as front-to-back listening experience. I understand that there will be no new Stereolab full-length CD until 2006, and this Monade CD is a great way to fill in the gap until then."
3,Pretty Good But Sort Of Pointless.....,It's a little confusing to figure out what the point of Monade is since it's basically Stereolab-lite... nothing more. I guess I was hoping for something a little outside the box from Laetitia Sadier but unfortunately there aren't any real surprises here because... well... it's Stereolab. The cd isn't bad but it doesn't come across as a side project that serves any real purpose.
1,Disappointing.....,"I am a ESL Conversation Teacher overseas (who has lived overseas for 11 years). Most of the topics are completely inappropriate, devoid of cultural/religious sensitivities, thus, I found myself rewriting most of the lessons. I had no idea I was buying an extremely agenda driven book (leading questions towards author's opinion, etc.). My students were really just not that interested in discussing at what age a woman should stop having biological children, or about a girl in Florida who wanted to divorce her parents. This is a very ""western"" book that does not work well at all overseas, and tends to offer negative stereotype of the US. I am disappointed."
4,Keep those students moving!,"This is such a creative book for ideas to use with more advanced ESL students. It's of interest to 21st.century learners, so the activities catch their interest, and mine! I've used it for small groups in a larger class & it has worked extremely well.It means I don't have to invent the wheel every week, seaching for new ideas. We volunteer tutors need all the help we can get! ""Discussion Starters"" is my new best friend..."
5,Acoustucal marvel,I got this for my laserdisc player and transformed it from the equivalent of a 78 LP player to Dolby sound DVD. The price at $29 was OK just for the brand name. Bought a cheaper $5 toslink cable for comparison and will let you know. Right now I have unleashed the full sound of my 400 laser movies for the first time. Only possible now with upgrade of 25 year old amplifier.
3,Incredible ending...but not in a good way,"I've enjoyed all the books in this series. However, the ending in this one left me mystified. I wont spoil it for you but based on the rationale Hal & Rani both laid out for their actions the resolution of the book (abruptly wrapped-up in the last four pages!) was incredible...and not it a good way.Other reviewers commented on the lack of romance between Hal & Rani. I disagree. It was clearly there; it was just never declared.I'll probably read the next book when it comes out just to see if the series is redeemable."
2,Not what I expected,The shoes were cute but the part that sticks between my sons feet was too thick. There was too much fabric for someone with little toes. It kept slipping out and the shoes would fall off. My son diid not like the way they fit so he kept taking them off. If reef would make the fabric less thick then they would be great shoes for infants.
1,Alan Skorski is a WACKO!!,"From mediamatters.org"" From a March 25, 2000, Washington Post article about the controversy surrounding an exhibit at New York's Whitney Museum:On Thursday afternoon, as hundreds of people waited in line to be among the first to view the Biennial, a lone protester stood in front of the museum, holding up a homemade poster that depicted Rosie O'Donnell, Hillary Clinton and Alec Baldwin wearing swastika armbands.Alan Skorski, 37, wore a yarmulke, argued with museum-goers and said he was objecting to the exhibit because ""enough is enough."""
1,uncomfortable and feels cheap,I didn't like this shoe. The laces sometimes pop out of the top 2 hooks. There are uncomfortable pressure points near the top of the tongue.
5,"Well done story, just scary enough.","(spoiler alert?) This is one of my granddaughter's (7) favorite movie in the last couple years. (I would have lowered the rating because I am rather sick of it, since she watches it over and over, but that wouldn't be fair..) That said, she got a lot out of our discussions about the plot of the movie and how television and movies are made. Bolt is a dog actor, playing a super-hero dog in a TV series and he is unaware (because the director has carefully hidden the truth) that he is just an average dog, playing a part. There is some violence, in the show within the movie, and the dog's owner is almost killed in a fire, towards the end, but by then, she was pretty sure the real Bolt will prevail, and be even better than the fantasy one."
5,Great,I love that dog in this movie. I think all ages would enjoy watching this movie alone or with a group.
4,Kids really liked it,The movie is very entertaining and I LOVE that it had both the Blu-Ray and the DVD - this way they can watch it at home and in the car.
5,Arrived Super Fast,My wife and I got tired of having this movie on the DVR so we ordered it for our daughter. It was no longer available in stores and was a great purchase.
4,good purchase,"It's a good dvd, but I think for a deluxe edition it isn't so luxurious in his content, but still is good."
1,Never buy from this company.,This company will advertise it as something and they will send you something else. Then after you reported it they will say they don't even have the item they are advertising.
5,Love the 3 disc set,Nice to get a blu-ray disc and a regular dvd disc and a digital copy esp. with kids!
1,SAMPLE OR FREEBEE EDITION NOT FOR SALE,This version was a free copy that was to come with other products.Its not to be soldNot the true retail copy for sale.The box did't have 2d or dvd or digital copy as the real 3d box retail box would have.((((IT CLEARLY MARKED ON THE BOX COVER NO INTENDED FOR indivdual sales or for IT TO BE SOLD )))) IT was to have been A freebeA Copy right violation
4,Angry Young Men Indeed,"Mr. Morris's review offers the requisite enlightenment per the Angry Young Men phenomenon. Alas, the fellow who actually wrote the screenplay for ""Room at the Top,"" though young and somewhat angry, was in fact the Canadian novelist and essayist Mordecai Richler, which, I suppose, is why he does not merit membership in this august group of Brits."
4,Chair Mat,"Shipped Fast, great product. Slight bend in the edge that doesn't wont to come out. Something hit it or it was how it was stored. It doesn't effect the product, it's just annoying knowing it is there."
5,Nice Shoe!,"I purchased the Black color of this Terra Plana shoe. I have gotton so many compliments when I wear them. I love how they feel on my feet as well. I just smile thinking about them. I will not hesitate to purchase another pair of Terra Plana at any other time! Be unique, be orginal, buy these shoes!"
1,"seasons 1-4 i love. season 5, hate","i hate justice league, this is spose to be ""the batman"", not justice league poop. first four seasons are worth having and rewatching over and over ^_^"
4,Edible Passion Vine Plant,I really like the passion vine plant however it seems to be still in a semi dormant stage which surprises me because my other one is doing great. Not sure it is going to make it. Thank you AmazonEdible Passion Vine Plant - Passiflora caerulea-Exotic!
5,ike book,I hear this book was well received. I like sending my grandson books and he likes getting them. Service as always was good.
4,Nice classic looking and reliable watch,"Simple design, nice solid feel, reliably working for several years now. Only con is that it doesn't seem to stay wind up as long as we expect, and needs to be readjusted. Still would buy it again though."
5,Touching Horses,"A friend lent me her book to read when I got my new horse. I couldn't wait to order my own copy! This is a must have for any horse lover. At our stable we are very much into the care of our horses. This book is an easy to read guide to using acupressure massage to keep the horse happy and healthy in body and spirit. It also addresses specific treatments for ailments including lameness and colic. The author tells the story of how her own mare was saved from the pain and stress caused by a trailing accident. In fact, her mare Kate is freguently used as a model to illustrate the massage technigues and the meridans of the horse's body. I found the many photos and illustrations a great visual guide in practicing these techniques on my own horse. My horse and I highly recommend this book!"
5,New life for older Macs,If you have an older G3 mac or ibook upgrading to 10.4 Tiger could add years of usefulness. I upgraded the software on a G3 powerbook and am very happy with the results. I would recommend this software for any Mac users that still want to hang on to that old Powermac (G3 or G4)Apple Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger [OLD VERSION]
4,"Slightly older, but definitely RECOMMENDED!","I'm not a fan of buying a new OS when it first comes out. I'd rather wait until most, if not many, of the bugs have been fixed. My iBook came with OS X Jaguar (10.3.x) preinstalled, and had been upgraded to 10.3.9. When Apple came out with Leopard (10.5), I took the plunge and bought Tiger (10.4.x), and now my iBook is running on 10.4.11, and I've experienced no problems whatsoever. This laptop (12"" screen, 1.2 GHz PowerPC G4, 768 MB DDR SDRAM, upgradable to 1.2 GB) is a couple years old (purchased in 2005), and, obvioiusly, uses the old PowerPC processor, but is quite capable of running Leopard should I choose to install it. However, I'm content to run on a slightly older OS, such as this one, knowing that the majority of the bugs experienced with it have been ironed out. My only real complaint so far is that it took an incredible amount of time to install, but it has worked flawlessly ever since. RECOMMENDED!"
3,Another great Lucky Santangelo novel!,"The ""Lucky"" Books seem to be her best and this is no exception. Great characters all around too. For those who have not read any of her earlier ""Lucky"" books, fear not. This book has hints of previously introduced characters so you will not feel lost and confused reading about them. You can easily go back to her other ""Lucky"" books and see what you had missed!A quick synopsis: Lucky Santangelo, now married to Lennie Golden, writer and director, is now herself working in the movie biz. As she deals with this part of her life, another part starts to fall apart when a family member is gunned down in cold blood and it starts to affect her marraige to Lennie.The characters in this book are well developed and I find that I care about each one of them. We root for Lucky as she tries to find the killers and as always there is that happy ending! You wont' be disappointed with DANGEROUS KISS."
3,"Not bad, but typical","This is a valuable book in that it provides insight into a little known, but nevertheless important event in 20th Century American. The significance, however, is not in the 2 day brawl in South Bend, but rather in the dramatic rise and influence of the Klan in the early 1900's.Easy to read and adequately researched, alas as in the case with almost every book about Notre Dame regardless of the topic, there has to be a chapter on Knute Rockne, George Gipp, Grantland Rice, ... And as a Notre Dame grad the author was unable to avoid that pitfall and as such still had to find a way to include The Four Horsemen and National Championships in a story about bigotry and prejudice in rural America in the 1920's."
3,"Nice performance, but this is one of Offenbach's weakest","Nice performance, quite entertaining, but this is one of Offenbach's weakest compositions. It is by far less quality than his last one ""The Tales of Hoffman"". In the present Operetta one can see Offenbach's mediocrity, rather than his genius that was exposed only later."
2,A bit of a disappointment,"After enjoying her other books, I was really looking forward to this book based on the reviews and plot line. Oi - def get this one used or at the library as this is a diluted fluff piece better suited to an under $5.00 book line ... certainly not a $14.00 one *ugh* With weak character development and almost viewable word padding to make up for lack of plot and character interaction, I can barely force myself to get through it, and only am forcing myself to do so because of the $$ it cost me :-("
2,At times sweet but most frequently shallow,"The story was often choppy and the characters were not developed. I could never quite believe that the heroine was in love. It's far from being the worst book I've ever read. I would not, however, recommend it."
2,Rushing to the finish line!,"I was so looking forward to see this miniseries after having seen the VHS shortened version many years ago.I really did enjoy watching the opening episode with the fantastic Ian Charleson and brilliant Donald Pleasance.Unfortunately the rest of the series seems terribly rushed with characters aging at a ludicrous speed (Dyan Cannon),i totally lost interest in the characters because of the frenetic pace of the storylines.I couldn't even bring myself to watch it all...To be honest it felt like part 2 to 4 were badly edited/condensed while part 1 was left virtually intact.Also the quality of the picture was atrocious which is odd as i'm sure it was photographed on film.A better transfer of a miniseries is ""Centennial"" which is spread out on 6 discs with wonderful picture quality."
5,Impeccable solo piano,"Dave McKenna is one of the few pianists who actually has a sense of swing & time that is better than most drummers & bassists. Concord usually records him in a solo setting & that's actually his best format, showing off his unique combination of delicacy & barrelhouse power. He has a formidable amount of pop songs in his head, & likes to medley them in themed groupings: the medley here is about ""Knowledge"", & includes a wonderfully hard-hitting ""I Didn't Know What Time It Was"", a gentle ""I Didn't Know about You"" & a rousing ""I Never Knew"". The encore is a ""Limehouse Blues"" that nicely shows off in succession his dreamy & swinging sides. McKenna is never less than excellent on any of his recordings--he's a pro's pro--& this is as solid as any of them."
5,Beautiful !,"I bought this for my Moyher for Christmas, it is just amazing.I wish I had gotten one for myself. You would not be dissapointed with this product."
2,unsatisfactory item,"I was very disappionted with this set. The caps didn't fit but Amazonoffered to replace the order. After several weeks waiting for the item to return to stock, I decided to take a refund. The set is attractive and matches my stemware but I'll pass on a reorder."
5,"Let sleeping princesses lie, and lying princesses sleep","This is an enjoyable, and very readable, princess story about manners, and seeing what is below the surface. Good information for me (raising these little Prince Charmings) to pass along about how to choose a bride."
5,Quality copier at a great price,This is just what I was looking for in a copier. It has the features I needed: letter-size/legal and expansion/reduction. Canon makes a quality product and this is no exception.
4,Great Machine For The Money,"I bought this machine for use in my home music studio. I teach private music lessons and find that I'm regularly needing to photocopy music for a student to use as a rehearsal copy. (No copyright violations here!) I've got the machine connected to my Windows laptop computer (running XP) and I don't recall having any difficulty installing the drivers at all. This machine has performed flawlessly as a printer and as a copier and, for the price, it's a very good deal."
4,Where sadness meets beauty...,"The darkest and sombrest of songs, the deepest of growls and the saddesr of emotions are combined and chained to this album... Slow, bombastic metal... Very good guitar playing, awsome grunts, lovely and emotional piano's and violins haunt every second of this cd... The lyrics are poetic without clichees... They are most of the time about losing what is precious...Many good symphonic and synthesized parts are on many songs, giving much emotion... Clean vocals are among grunts and screams... This is one versatile band!If you're not sure yet, try to get some samples: Meaning of Forever I and Memories Never Die are good examples of the style Morphia sets..."
2,Poor clip design,"Would you by a great car with square tires? I was excited to upgrade from the previous version of this camera so that I could remove the velcro from my laptop. Unfortunately, the challenge of creating a clip which will work on Dell's round-edged inspiron has once again evaded Logitech. The velcro remains."
4,Good cam for a reasonable price,The picture quality is excellent.The only issue is that there is a voice echo that the product does not eliminate even though there is a feature for it.I use a Logitech USB 150 which provides excellent voice quality using Skype and MSN/Yahoo Messenger.
3,ok for the price!,"The delivery and everything was pretty good.But the cam gets stuck before starting..but once it starts broadcasting its uninterrupted..can use it only on skype for now..doesnt work with yahoo messenger..and its a bit bulky for a 2MP camera..But then the price was the clincher..if looking for quality ,certainly this is not for you.."
4,Two Thumbs up for Quickcam Notebook Pro,"Notebooks Pro is the highest rated webcam (for notebooks) on the market and for good reason. Audio and Video quality is excellent. You can talk normal and be 2 or 3 feet away with no problem. The echo cancellation feature is a true must for webcams, especially with the use of video. On the negative side the USB cable is too short which limits interchangeability with your desktop. Also, I have the Quickcam Fusion for my desktop which is a 5 star rated product and without doubt the best of the best webcams overall. Logitech ships that product with Quickcam 10 software which is probably a nice update to Quickcam 9 the Notebook Pro uses. Unfortunately, Logitech provides little detail and info on these technical and software issues. Bo"
5,Excellent durable and classy product.,"Looks great. It is also functional and durable. The size chart can be misleading, though. You might end up getting one size larger and having to return it for one size smaller!"
2,I didn't like the new renditions,"Others may prefer that this isn't just a 'greatest hits' album from Disney and has new folks singing the old songs, but to my ear they just didn't have the charm of the originals and not what I want to listen to."
3,Chicago By Numbers.,"Starting out with the self titled Chicago Transit Authority from 1969, they changed name for 1970's Chicago II and by 1982 had reached Chicago 16.Earlier days were often on the heavier side of jazz rock, by 16 this was not so much to the fore.Always well produced, but not always entirely distinctive, 16 does not hold my attention from start to finnish.Hard To say I/m Sorry/Get Away is maybe the best here, but not for me equal to earlier top notch recordings, for example, 25 Or 6 To 4, Wishing You Were Here or If You Leave Me Now."
2,Cordless Beard & Mustache Trimmer,"This product don't do what it suppose to do, after trying the trimer, I windup using the cliper to finish the job."
3,Like,very good machine but should bring more parts to cut .. has no problems is very good and it was sealed and in good condition
5,Great housekeeping helper!,"Several years ago a girlfriend told me about this product as I was fussing about how to quickly clean my leather sofas when grandchildren came to visit. I purchased it at that time at the local outlet which she used, but recently I ran out and could not find it locally so I searched on Amazon and -Voila! -there it was! It really works slick and quick, and makes my sofas look so nice when company's coming, or when the grandchildren have just left and smears reveal their little accidents. The pull-through delivery just under the lid has a habit of letting through more than one before I can get it torn free, so I've had to learn to be more careful when pulling one out. They are spendy, so I certainly don't want to waste them. But the product is worth the cost."
2,"Mostly junk, although eventually we got it done..","For what I used this on, it is junk. Metal is so cheap, and the taper is non-existant. For auto fuel lines, go with the cheap plastic inserts. They work much better. This... not so much.This tool is a combo, and do to that, it makes it hard to get into tight places... like on top of a fuel tank. It also is a pain (litterally) because you must sqeeze it to keep it together, and then push forward rather hard. I would stay away!"
3,"Not great, not bad",I was really excited to try clam chowder from Maine but it did not wow me. I think Campbell's might even be better....
4,WOW!,"A Nepenthean Solution by Rod Rogers is mind boggling in its scope. With a universe that is billions of years old why wouldn't there be civilizations so ancient as to make us seem like children. So why would they care about us? That is the great driving force of this story. The author has the great characters, deep plotting, scientific & social insights that make for a great read. I can't wait for the follow up. I grew up reading Heinlein, Asimov, Clarke, and all the rest of that era; Rod Rogers' writing stands well among them. He reminds me of the first time I found John Varley...Not so much that they have similar styles...more that it excited me about sci-fi all over again. Highly recommended."
4,All the good ones die,"I think my sentiments mirror most of the posts on here but I will try not to be too redundant. I prefer MAT over Grill but don't get me wrong, this is a must have. I bought these in the wrong order, I purchased MAT and was so impressed that I bought this one the next day. On MAT he is ""on"". He is much more crisp (sober perhaps?)and the audience on MAT is obviously more familiar with his stuff and they are with him from the getgo. On Grill he moves at much slower pace, mumbling much more and takes a while to get going. You can tell the audience doesn't quite know what to make of him at first. His delivery on this is definitely quite different than here. He might have just been more intoxicated at this gig, who knows. I wish I'd had a chance to see him live. I had seen him on Comedy Central years ago but didn't realize his true genius until I purchased his CDs after his death. He will be like Bill Hicks, underappreciated until after his death. RIP."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,Skip this book unless you want to replace sleeping pills! The reading is belaboring.The much better Kiss related book is KISS & Tell by Gordon Gebert and Bob McAdams. I found myself literally laughing out loud reading it. Bound to be a classic years to come.
5,Incredible Printing,"Beautifully printed with gravure printing this is a joy to look at. Large and oversized, these photographs look stunning. This is Duane Michals from his prime period and recommended for fans of his."
2,Grrrrrrrrrr,Purchased the book with the Infotrack extra intact. Problem is Infotrack went out of business in 2008. Paid extra for nothing.
3,.,"A good read, with a nice array of facts. The main problem is that it appears that this book skipped by the editor's desk - several areas with sentences repeated as though they weren't sure which ones to use and didn't filter them out or mixed up country names. But a good history none the less."
1,some info please...,"This isn't a review, but I wanted to say that you should really give the potential buyer some info about what it is they are thinking of purchasing. This book looks like what I want, but I know nothing about it, especially since there are no reviews. Please tell us something about what we're buying!"
5,Yo Ho Ho and a Bucket of Prawns...,"My son and I LOVE to sing the Yo Ho Ho song!Salty is my son's newest acquisition in the Thomas line. He had Salty in the small diecast metal form, but wanted the wooden version so it can chug on the wooden railways.Salty is an older diesel who loves to tell tales of the sea. He will occasionally work in the quarry and other areas on the Island of Sodor, but is happiest down by the docks.Salty has two adorable bottom teeth, and is very good natured. My son created water on paper to pretend that he's down by the docks, and includes Cranky and the Aquarium Cars for pretend play.Very nice--and affordable!--addition to the Thomas series."
5,Thats what I am talkin about!,"Okay boys and girls past the age of 35, this is it. The same fun we had with Elton John, Sweet etc.. Funky British rock. If you don't feel good after hearing take your mama out I don't think there is much hope for you. I blew my teenage sons out of the den when I played this one real loud. Give it a try. I don't think you will be dissappointed. (if you are you take life much too seriously)"
2,worth a download,"Disco is terrible, and trying to cover the best band ever with very gay disco beats is abominable. It will please gays and hipsters, but that's about it. Chorus almost unlistenable, unless you happen to like the Bee Gees (shudder). I will give it merits for fantastic production value, but of all the annoying remixes, none comes close to being as good as the timeless Floyd classic."
2,They want me to down 4 Tbsp of this?,"Perhaps I should do a video review and sample some just to show the reaction to this flavor...sour doesn't begin to describe how harsh this stuff is. I would much rather down cough syrup than this stuff (another reviewer thought it tasted slightly better than it). Obviously the taste camp is pretty diverse amongst reviewers. If the other reviewer thought this was the best tasting liquid amino supplement he's tried, well, I don't want to try any others. Also another reviewer said it was a great replacement for powders - this is to be taken in addition to protein powder - and get a blender bottle and a decent powder and you won't have those issues. I'm sure this stuff is functionally amazing, but after I finish this thing, unless I see totally awesome results, I'm not buying it again. It's a shame too because ON tends to make awesome supps."
1,Gets Hot and Doesn't Cut,"Bought this trimmer based on the good reviews, but it does not cut at all and gets extremely hot. Not worth the trouble to return, so in the trash it will go!"
1,Okay if all you want is a nose massage :),"In order for this to cut any hair, you have to pretty much manipulate each strand of hair into one of the slits (like threading a needle) and then hope the blade cuts it. If you run this around your O2 hole long enough and tilt it in all kinds of directions, you will end up trimming (although not always to an acceptable length) maybe 50% of the hair. But your nose will tingle for a while if you like that sort of thing!I'm sure Amazon would have taken it back, but didn't want to go through the trouble for this cheap item."
5,Why spend more...LOVE THIS ONE!,Had a really great trimmer by Panasonic that gave out on me awhile back! Bought another one by the same manufacturer and it was terrible! Bought this one and it does a great job! Highly recommend this product! Don't need bells and whistles...just something that does this awful job WELL!
4,Very Good Product,After reading the other reviews I was pretty certain this is what I wanted and it works just like I thought it would. It doesn't pull or hurt and the only reason I didn't get it 5 stars as I think it could be a bit more powerful so you don't have to go over an area more than once. I would buy it again.
2,less than expected,"not a solid product ,it has on/off button not working properly. it looks like it is going to crumble if i push hard"
1,"Don't waste your money, it doesn't work","It has decent reviews but it just simply doesn't work, I had an old Vidal sasoon brand, looks like the panasonic basic model, and it was 100% better, this is junk and it gets hot while and yet it doest cut. Not worth returning I'm just going to throw it in the trash."
1,Alert! wrong CD pressing...,"I bought three times this CD from three different countries (USA, France, England) and each time the CD inside is the Rachmaninoff's fourth piano concerto played by Earl Wild with Jascha Horenstein conducting the RPO. The label on the CD is ok with the mention of Charles Munch conducting the RPO but THREE TIMES the CD inside is the Rachmaninoff recording with the Charles Munch name on the label ! I wrote to Chesky at New York with the three wrong CDs returned to them... but any answer after one year! NOT ONE SERIOUS RECORDING COMPANY and any consideration for the music-lovers who bought this wrong Chesky CD.Sorry for my bad English."
4,four-and-a-half stars out of five(0) on amazon's liberal five-star scale,"A very good season, a little better than the tenthseason, when Chin Ho Kelly gets cacked in the 10thseason finale. The ninth season Five-0 staff inclu-des the usual soild foursome of McGarrett, Danno,Chin Ho and now Duke Lukela on the cover. FormerPro Football player Herman Wedemeyer (Colts, Donsof the ancient AAFC back in the late forties) star-ted wearing plain clothes for good in season eight,but was not on the intro with Jack Lord, James Mac-Arthur and Kam Fong Chun until season 9. very solidseason starts with a great two-hour (later sydicat-ed in two parts) 'Nine Dragons'. What would a seasonof Five-0 be without Keigh Deigh as 'Wo Fat'??!!@!Pick Up On It!"
5,Book 'em Dano,The best. The original and the best. The series had started to show its age by this point but still a must-have if you collect classic 70's television.
3,Better Than Expected,"This movie is a virtual scene for scene remake of a 1985 movie called ""Streetwalkin'."" And it has some of the same actors too. I liked this version better and Leslie Bega,who plays Micki, is really hot! However, I am wondering why they changed the name of this movie. It used to be called ""Angel In Red"" and I liked that title better. ""Uncaged"" is too generic and vague."
4,Dark and melodic music finally done well,"Ok, so i haven't heard any of their stuff from before Draconian Times. But this is by far their best release. The songs here are heavy and guitar based, and a great gloomy atmosphere is created, without ever being boring. And its all unexpectedly well recorded!Maybe its the lack of goth in me, but i find the best four tracks are also the easiest to listen to. Grey, Redshift, Forever After and Accept the Pain all feature nice guitar work backed up with strong and memorable choruses.Performances are all top notch - i've already mentioned the guitar work, but credit should also go to the drummer, who provides a pounding backdrop. He certainly likes his cymbals. Vocals are also very good, being dark but credible. Further proof that incoherent growls are unnecessary!Admittedly there are a couple of filler tracks, but combined with the great packaging and good production, this album is a necessary purchase for both fans and newcomers alike."
1,It works but is poorly made,"I prefer carrying my gear in messenger bags (e.g., Timbuk2) and own a wide variety of photo inserts for my converted bags. The Domke 720-2JM is by far the poorest insert in terms of workmanship and materials: unsealed seams, loose threads, rough interior cloth, thin padding and no padding on the bottom. Save your money and spend a little more for a Crumpler or Timbuk2 insert."
3,abitpissed,"I ordered a couple of these and ""they arrived rapidly and intact as expected"" ONE PROBLEM -----They Sent MOGUL BASED RATHER THAN MEDIUM BASED BULBS !!! Fortunately there are Adapters one can purchase however they may make the bulbs to long to fit into the fixture !!!"
3,Chair Mat,The chair mat was the correct size and for the money it is ok. The mat does not stay in position and slides out of position. It has to be repositioned almost daily. The mat is very thin and my chair seems to make deep impressions in the carpet thru the mat. Sometimes it becomes difficult to roll the chair out of the deep impressions.
5,Off The Wall Guitar Hanger,I liked the first Off The Wall Guitar hanger so much that I bought a second. Great way to store guitars and free up space.
1,Turned sticky,"I bought 6 of these...seemed to be pretty awesome...one day pick up a guitar to find that the ""coating"" on the hanger is breaking down and had mared the finish of the headstock...I checked all of them and they were also in various stages of the same breakdown. Very upset about the lack of quality of materials used!"
5,Biocosm radically changes our model of existence,"Every once in awhile a science book hits the market that has the power to forever change the public's perception of our existence. Books like Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time and Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe presented concepts so unique that they forced us all to take a big gulp and digest bold new thoughts about our existence.James Gardner's Biocosm falls into this category. This book takes a fresh look at everything we know about life and the universe and makes us think in a radical new way. Ultimately, the importance of books like this lie not in the details of their theories (which are ultimately superseded by others) but in their power to help humanity grasp what we are and how we came to be. If the question of existence is a priority for you then you must read Biocosm."
2,Buyer Beware,"In the photo of these earrings, the setting appears to be substantial. In reality, it much too delicate and flimsy for stones of this size."
5,Great price for a durable and sleek set of glasses!,"I paid $13 for this set of four, which works out to $3.25 per glass. The stems are thick and sturdy and really seem like they could survive if you accidentally knocked one over (which happens when you're drinking enough martinis...). I have another set of martini glasses that take up tons of room in my cabinet but these take up about as much space as a standard red wine glass. I like the design a lot; subtle but stylish. I definitely recommend these!"
4,Excellent for the Topic,"I purchased this book as a gift because my mother was very touched by the life of Hildegard. Though I did not read the book ""cover to cover"" the selections I read through provide some deep insight into the live of a devoted and faithful woman living in an age way before her time."
3,More lyrics would have been nice,"While it was great to get an overview of her writing, I would have enjoyed more texts from her music."
2,snapshots of chess,"This book was very frustrating to me, as I was expecting a cohesive instructional work. What I got was ""snapshots"" of practical chess--hints here and there, but with no cohesive theme. I am not sure whom this book is aimed at, or what niche it fills. I find Purdy's book, The Search for Chess Perfection, much more helpful as to ""secrets"" or practical chess."
5,Most attractive and interesting book on origami I have seen,This book will hold your interest and get you intrigued with origami even if you have never tried it before. Instructions are easy to follow and the results will have you looking for more paper to fold. My copy mysteriously disappeared and I have been trying to replace it. Would like to hear from anyone with any leads.
5,Great Book,"Of the 65 origami books I own, this is one of my favorites. It's simple and clear with wonderful color photographs. I love the clothes models at the start and the instructions for origami jewelry at the end. I wish it were still in print."
3,Sturdy but a bit unstable.,"Very strong frame, its only flaw is created by the way the frame is put together. Each side is held only at one place and create an hinge. With the opening and closing of the drawer the frame moves a bit and with the weight of files it can collapse. I've added a crossbar between the vertical and horizontal frame to make it sturdier.I'd recommend this frame to someone that has a drawer shorter than 27'', mine is 27'' (the maximum length of this frame) and it wobbles a bit(before I've added the crossbars)."
1,FOR PRETEENS ONLY,"A disappointment indeed. This movie is to much like scream and all the other late 90's teenybooper films. Its about Prom Night the lamest night of them all. It does however have Jamie Lee Curtis in it and she is a terrific actress,but Leslie Nielsen should to stick to Naked Gun movies he was pretty bad in this film. Lastly this movie wouldn't even scare three girlfriends at a sleepover,its not scary just comical that they made a film that was on prom that was actually gonna be scary but instead failed miserably."
3,The Original Prom Night,"Wanted to see this for a while, I like this original one better than the remake and Jamie Lee AGAIN does a great job. Love her scary movies."
2,Prom Night,"Years ago, a group of children playing accidently kill one of their friends, and decide to keep a secret. Years later when they're all in high school, the girls twin brother exacts bloody revenge against them. Your typical 80s horror film, not very notable other than Leslie Nielsen, and Jamie Lee Curtis. This is one prom, better left unattended!"
3,Cheap feeling but work,"I had an older version of these headphones that lasted for years, big, metal and really good sound. I figured I might as well replace them since the ear cushions were starting to wear out. I was very dissapointed when these arived, they are no longer big heavy duty feeling headphones, but cheap, plastic, small ones that look like a Chinese knock-off of my old ones. The sound is fine, not ""surround-sound"" but works fine. I originally bought them becasue i was having sound issues with my on board sound card and needed a way around it, they work well for that but don't expect to be blown away, they sound no different then regular headphones.Bottom line: If you need a quick solution for getting sound out of your computer these will do the trick (linux, pc, mac) but don't spend more than $25 bucks on them or you will feel ripped off."
2,"It is a ""Just OK game""","This game was kind of like the Episode 1 of Star Wars. You expected a GREAT product and didn't get it. The end result of all the hype fell well short of expectations. The game play is actually pretty horrible, very repetitive and sometimes quite annoying. The graphics however are VERY well done in the original style. It does however look rushed. The models used are not polished by any means. I did buy it, and I would buy it again. But, only because I am a HUGE Macross/Robotech fan. As far as replay goes, I finished the game and have not opened the box since. I had more fun with the last segment of the Ace Combat Series for PS2. I do reccomend it for Macross/Robotech fans looking for something to bring back the memories of the original series (I remember when it aired on TV =) But, I am really disapointed overall. The game changed very little from whay TDK showed at E3 prior to the debut and has a VERY rushed out the door feeling."
2,Not even passable entertain,"This game could have, should have been so much more. The developers made this game where you are confined to one mode or another. If you change modes into anything other than the recommended mode the level is virtually impossible to complete. Save your money. After buying this game I will never ever pre-order a game again."
1,Bad choices with some interesting reviews,"I found this book frustrating. I thought the selection of movies was sloppy and one-sided, but using text from the time of the movie's original release was sometimes interesting. Some very poor movies were selected to fill out the goal of 1000 titles. Some very good movies curiously failed to make the cut."
4,ok,this was a pretty goo book i was just did not understand why stand by me was to in it i mean that movie is a huge classic made in the 1980's.
3,Price?,Seeing the price of these Maalox tabs really gave me heartburn!! Is this a typo....$32.95 for 65 tabs?? That is about 51 cents per tablet. Admittedly it has been a few years since I bought the product but the last time I did it was about five or 6 dollars per bottle. And I can't even find it in the stores. What's going on here?
2,I Didn't Get It??????????????,I absolutely love and adore Halle Berry but this was not one of her better films. I didn't get the storyline at all. I still love Halle but I wish I hadn't spent $20 for this one.
5,Perfect Picture Quility,"This HD-DVD exhibits A Perfect Picture Quility in MPEG4-AVC.As A viewer you almost feel like part of this film!This human study is so compelling and intensly frightful at the same time.Brilliant acting,Halle and Benico are amazing.The camera close-up's pull you in to there very soul's,and work like the silence of thunder on my own soul.The sound is unspectacular but precise,there are a lot of details that create a very realistic ambience ,This HD-DVD is a must have."
4,Another good product from Sabrina Silver,I will definitely order more products from this seller. I bought this owl because it came with the chain. Completely satisfied with the purchase.
2,Built in Cambodia?,"These hanging file folders could be a bit more sturdy. The design is good but the plastic can fracture easily with almost any twisting or force at all, like when you are assembling them..."
4,Lots of real-fu action,"Not bad at all. No wire-fu (I like wire-fu) but the intensity and complexity of the fight scenes kept my attention and the plot had a few interesting twists and so was not as predictable as some. The styles were an invulnerable 'spiritual' style and lots of animal styles. The weapons were knives, staff, hoop(!) and fans.The reason I did not give it more stars (I would give it 3.5 stars if it was possible) was because once in a while the choreography allowed us to see that it was, indeed, choreography and the *attrocious* sound quality. The video quality, well, like many others of this genre, it was taken from an old reel of film - but it did not distract me from the movie itself, except during the very 1st and very last frames."
2,Not as precise as expected.,"This makes a lot of noise, so I know it's on, but it requires multiple ""passes"" in order to achieve the cuts/trims. Would not purchase again."
4,Proper Use/ Personal Best Results,"I have used my boiley several times at this point. I have tried a gambit of different settings and times. In general, I do agree that the timing is wrong for the boiley, if you use the eggs straight from the fridge. I have found that if you let them sit on the counter, then the prescribed times are more accurate. I made two eggs today and the whites were fully cooked, but the yolk was more translucent, then pale yellow. I personally prefer soft boiled so this wasn't an issue with me."
3,real rating 3.5 stars!,"I bought this album because of Alianza de Generales which to me is the highest-peak of this album or any album. The rest are solid numbers but they do not reach the intensity achieved by Alianza, the other song following ALianza de generales is Aqui en mi Pueblo by Andy Monta~ez. I will reccommend this album for those two songs which are the highlight!"
1,Did not receive merchandise from lworlddistribution. Don't order from them.,"Did not receive item from lworlddistribution. looks like a good book. They supposedly shipped it Nov. 4, but it is Dec. 7 and I do not have it yet. Other people left comments on their website that they had not responded to their emails re: items ordered from them. How do we get better protection from people like this? I really want this book ASAP. What do I do Now?Amazon, please answer me.J.C. Lewis"
3,Repossessed / Leslie Nielsen (the lost collection),"Leslie Nielsen, A retired exorcist, is called back into assisting in the removal of a ""demonic spirit'. This is a parody on the original Linda Blair version of the Exorcist ""fright movie"". Vampire and Dracula characters also add to this comical version of the original classic. Leslie Nielsen and Linda Blair are not at their best in a situation comedy like this. Fortunately both actors have much better acting in later movies. Humorous, slapstick, and entertaining on a rainy day."
4,Classic Parody!,"Much older, yet better than all the lame Waynes' Brothers' parody movies that are all alike. This is an original!"
5,"a must see, the funniest ever made","this movie was one of the most halarious movies i have ever seen, after watching the chilling trilogy of the Exorcist, this movie came as a shock to me i didn't expect to laugh soo much...so if you really want to have a good laugh you should watch this movie i promise it's the best comedy ever"
5,One of the Funniest Movies I've Seen!!,"This movie was great, and definately worth watching. Anthony Starke is FANTASTIC as Father Brophy, and Linda Blair and Leslie Nielsen are great as the devil and Father Mayai. It's great and will possess (no pun intended) you to the end."
3,I love Van...but this isn't my favorite.,"I think Van is sleepwalking through this one a little bit, but Van sleepwalking is better than almost anyone else at full effort. Several other reviews say they find it spiritual...if that is what you are looking for, I think ""No Guru, No Method, No Teacher"" is better."
3,Pretty good Van,"A very good Van album, rather then a great Van album I think. The three indisputable classics present here are 'Rave On John Donne', 'Inarticulate Speech of the Heart No1' and the beautiful and very moving 'Irish Heartbeat'. Elsewhere, there is a plethora of synth driven instrumentals and some padding that brings this collection down from excellent down to very good.But as fans of Mr Morrison say, even his lesser tunes are better then most peoples best efforts.As a whole 'ISOTH' is a very good listen and can be recommended to those who while enjoying the occasion portion of Van wouldn't want want to traverse the back alleys of his cataloge.Inarticulate Speech of the Heart"
3,"Fun game, but not great game","The THUG series is a pretty innovative spinoff of the THPS series. However, this is essentially the same game over and over. All of the Tony Hawk games have been literally the same thing from THPS to THUG2. On the bright side, the game's hilarious (Bam's Grind and Barf special) and the create-a-player mode has been modified for more choices, and creating a trick is easier than most would think. If you like the THPS series, go for this game. If you're just looking for a good game, you can find better, but I'm not saying this isn't a good game."
1,David.. tsk tsk,"The book is well intentioned but flawed in many of its conclusions...I would say at least 20% might be accurate, the rest is pure Bias and ignorance..If you have to buy, but there are better books out there on this Subject..."
2,The Biggest Secret: The Book That Will Change the World (Updated...,I just don't believe this guy in everything he says anymore. In my personal researches I have found out he (David) uses other book writers and researches that are not 100% correct rather theoretical possibilities. This guy reminds me of Einstein the biggest plagiarism in the history of mankind.
2,"If you enjoy laughing, read this one!","Okay, David Icke really scares me now. The fact that this was published and people read this are even sacrier. Let me point out some of the things that Icke does that I don't care about, but that he calims proves the brotherhood. 1)Apparently, since the Maltese Cross was used on Nazi uniforms and the British Royal Crown they worked together as part of a conspiracy. 2)Since the Nazi's used a eagle as one of their national symbols, and since the Egyptians used it about 2000 years earlier, they worked together too. Well, David, should we check with the Atlanta Falcons and Philidelphia Eagles and ask if they're part of the conspiracy? Icke also goes to point out other things, like the fact that the domes in Paris, London, and Washington look the same. So what! It's called a sytle, like Gothic or Baroque, you know? Although, I do have to admit that this was funny to read! I have have one thing to say about this book: Ick!"
5,Fascinating and Well-Sourced,"Icke's books are so irresistible because they present controversial material with the physics and the ""evidence"" to make them almost impossible not to believe. When I read him, my instinct simply says, ""yes, this makes perfect sense."" His manner of writing and his presentation of the material are extremely easy to grasp and a pleasure to read. This book I read in the 90's and afterwards, my whole Weltanschaung (world view) changed to some degree on account of it.I would say this is a book which will delight open-minded people who are not welded to any rigid belief system. It will challenge those whose ideologies demand more strict adherence.If knowledge is power, then I feel the greatest gift one could give to those about whom one cares is an Icke book. Indispensible information."
2,Where's the proof?,"The portion of the book dealing with Princess Diana's death is excellent and would hold up in a court of law. The other 90%, however, is based upon speculation, innuendo and an over-reliance on other works that have been written without facts. Even the photo of the bohemian grove ceremony is blurred."
1,Comedy but Nothing Else,"Great comedy value for the first few chapters. Unfortunately this could not be maintained probably due to the fact that the author seems quite serious. Everyone who is anyone is a lizard or controlled by one. My favorite was Queen Elizabeth, E-lizard-birth (get it?). I actually couldn't finish it having gotten lost in the lizard geneology. The review from a Reader from Sacramento gives an excellant review of the book. Possibly the most poorly referenced book that I have ever read. Many references are attributed to the author's previous writings or to books published by the same publisher. At least one subject I attempted to persue was referenced to an ""unpublished paper"".Read the first few chapters in the bookstore over a cup of coffee for the comedy and save your money."
5,what everybody should know and why,I found this book to be very informative and helpful to me and others that i am close to. Let me explain. David Icke expresses a very powerful series of raw emotions integrated with the realistic presence that i myself can relate to. This is something that must be accomplished beforehand: you must be able to open yourself up to new concepts. I had a similar background knowledge to what David Ickes book uses as a general ideology. This book has opened up my eyes and made me more aware of my everyday surroundings it is also what i believe will help me in future events. Buy this for yourself and the ones you love for their and your sake. Thanks Icke.
3,No Lizards Please!,"I really enjoyed this book, it was hard to put down. Unfortunately, I cannot share this with my loved ones, as it would confirm their thoughts on my (in)sanity. I wonder if the author has considered publishing a 'no lizard' version of the book?! Great food for thought!"
1,Invasion of the Lizard Men!,"And its not even fiction! Ed Wood might have made a god-awful cult favorite movie out of this. And to think people realy buy it! At least, I got my copy at the library. And no, I did not read all this money-grubbing idiots' drivel."
2,I've read better,"As a historian and researcher of conspiracy theories, I must say that Icke has the right idea. But I also have to say he is off, and not because of the shape-shifting reptilians, which I actually gave him brownie-points for. As a historian, I can tell by his writing that he made no attempt to disprove his own theories or try to question them in any way. He just read the fact and wrote it down. For an high school research paper this is excusible, but for a published book no. Icke needs to lower his ego a little and doubt his own accuracy. I certainly feel that his style left much to desire, as well as his research, little of which did not come from ""biased"" material. (Reading a simple history book one can still connect events). This book is fun to read, but if you really want to understand what's going on in the world, there are cartainly better books, and ones that will leave you less paranoid. (The Exxon sign the cross of Lorraine??)"
1,This is THE stupidest thing ive EVER read,Come on reptiles are running the world? This guy is completely insane. the only thing that was even slightly redeeming about this book is that i laughed harder than i had in a long time but trying to pass this off as non-fiction is rubbish read this only if you need a good laugh. i also wouldn't recomend this to any depressed or paranoid people cause although the ideas are moronic this might be enough to push them over the edge.
3,great deal on fasteners,Great product for the price. Just realize that you cannot use these with normal 8.5 x 11 pieces of paper unless you are using the landscape view.
5,Very Good basic Cable Tester/Tone Generator,"I have this for about 7 years now (till it I damaged/wrecked it manually by accident last month... already purchased a replacment)It has been very faithful to me doing a very simple job: testing your LAN cable, and it does it well and easy to understand.It just lights up each LED in sequence: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. If the remote side doesn't light at all or not in sequential order it's either a crossover cable or a faulty cable (the latter 99% of the time). Using this along with aTRENDnet Network Probe for TC-TP1, they have become my 'dynamic duo' of cable finding and testing.It uses a 9V battery and while it is a bit difficult to fit it in, once you're in, you're good to go. Never had cause to use the coax adapters, though.While I have heard there is better (aka fluke), the cost is simply not just not in my budget right now. Until then, I highly recommend this for your budget network cable testing and tone generating needs."
4,"It's cheap, and it works great!","This particular unit is a must have any IT personnel. It works great, and includes a nice case for storage. I can't justify spending more money for this type of tester, as there really isn't much to these units.Gregg Kulback"
1,crap,"To be fair, it's meant as a ""cable tester""- but it has a built-in tone generator, so I decided to see how it would work on a line with my Fluke Probe. Turns out I happened to pick an active phone line - LEDs are now broken, and this thing is now useless. If you are really just going to check cables that you make, this will work, but if you're going to do any work with cabling in the wall, save yourself the headache and get a Fluke Intellitone 200- it does a lot more anyway.Frank"
1,Awful Design!,"To properly use this unit you must have both ends in your sight to operate OR you have to walk to the other end of the cable after pressing ""auto"" to see the test results. Or you can have a second helper on your job yell back if the test passed. This is ludicrous. I sent this item back to Amazon immediately. Many other testers that I have used come with 2 pieces. The piece that is the terminator and the piece that does the testing. This allows for you to test your own wires, not run back and forth multiple times to see if your test passed. This product is only mildly more useful than setting up test network equipment and running back and forth to see if you get a connection. What a drag."
1,TrendNet Cable Tester 10/100 & Coax,"Bought this tester based on the reviews found here at Amazon. Product arrived promptly. I also purchased the Coax adapters as suggested in a review here. Had the experience to test coax shortly thereafter on a 150 ft. length of RG 6. Both ends were crimped incorrectly. Fixed it and was most impressed. Set up a couple of networks and same thing. Awesome I thought UNTIL... the first two LEDs quit working. Phoned TrendNet in California. Sent it back (fedEx cost $34.00) Now tester is worth $41 +$34 = $75.00. Ok as long as I get it replaced I thought. ""New"" tester arrived and 6 LEDs are inoperative. Lets see $34 more freight. Perhaps it is time to rethink this purchase. I now remember that ""The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of the cheap price has been forgotten. Good service from Amazon. Good service from TrendNet. Not so good a product from China."
3,One of their greatest works.,"""Cunabiche Adentro"", ""Pachito E Che"", ""Concierto De Amistad"" and the immortal ""Tambien Lo Se Yo"" are some of the hottest tracks which this legendary musical institution ever recorded and they remain staples in their live repertoire to this day. This album features Andy Montanez and Charlie Aponte on lead vocals and remains a highlight of mid-1970s Puerto Rican salsa and is a MUST for any serious salsero's collection. Unfortunately, the sound quality and remastering leave much to be desired."
3,Gets you where you are going.,As I write this review its a long time coming. We got this years ago. Compared to the GPS of today its rather large. But all in all it was good in its day.
1,not all of the music from the film is on this CD,"Great movie.However, if you liked the music as it was played by the little band featured in the movie, you will not find that music on this CD.And that is what a soundtrack should be.All of the music, esp. if it's good, from the movie on a CD.This soundtrack is more a Mark Knopfler CD and not the complete soundtrack from the movie ""Local Hero"".A good example of a great soundtrack CD is the Tom Petty music from the movie ""She's the One"".That CD has all of the music from that movie without exception.The other reviewers here talking about the great ""scottish folk music"" on this CD are just wrong.In the movie ""Local Hero"" there are fine examples of it, but on this soundtrack, there are only little snippets of it."
4,Good Summary,"This is a good starting point.I bought it thinking it was a much more developed description of Krashen's theories, but it is just a quick summary for one to get an idea.I only gav it for stars because of that, I did not realise it was just a small introduction to the subject.But as I said, it is a good starting point; from this book one can further research on what one is interested."
4,Cute. A good buy,"I was not familiar with the series but I bought this particular DVD because it offers a Spanish soundtrack choice and it's violence free.I'm happy with it and my 3 y.o. son seems to like it so far. The illustrations,the sound quality and the stories themselves are pretty good.Even though the narrator is excellent and very entertaining (at least in the Mexican version)the characters do not talk and I don't know if that will sustain my son's interest in the stories as he's used to more ""mature"" shows where the characters interact with the viewers. Also the narration follows the riming format.Definitely a gentle, entertaining DVD suitable to the younger set. A good buy."
4,It's here!!,"^.^ If you love the series from watching the fansubs, you have got to get this DVD. If for nothing else than your fav guy in in DVD quality. But then, the animation wasn't ever great in this show. Oh, and the English voice actors ... are better than I thought they'd be, but still bad. Watch it in Japanese. But the dubbed ""outtakes"" are real good for a laugh! And the great thing is that it's 5 eps on one DVD, so you get plenty for your money! Can't wait for the next one!Oh, and one should point out that this DVD also contain bios for the main voice actors. ^.^ So it's also good to get if you need to know about the real-life band. ^.~"
5,Always wanted to get these with English subtitles,now I finally can understand what is going on in the first real Anime I ever saw and got hooked on. I loved the outtakes in the extras section! They were so funny! A very well put together DVD.
4,Weiss Kruez is a must see!,"Weiss Kruez is great! The begining is slower then the rest of the series (of course!) but this is one of my favorites. Its got everything in Bishounen-ness: Youji's a ladies man, Omi's small and kawaii, Ken's athletic and shy, and Ran/Aya's cold and mean. If you're a fan of Rurouni Kenshin, Gundam, or Fushigi Yuugi, i think you'll enjoy Weiss Kruez"
4,American History told through a Family,"Andrea Constantine Hawkes has done a wonderful job of describing New England social history through the lens of a family, the Vickerys. The Vickery history starts with fishermen in Massachusetts Bay who later settle in a farming community in mid state Maine, Unity. It is the most reader friendly geneology I've read as Ms. Hawkes weaves the events of the day into the story of 10 generations. I particularly enjoyed the ""detour"" to Montana, where one branch of the Vickerys ( and Unity, Maine) settled.I recommend the book for non professional readers of New England history who want a glimpse into the life of our ancestors."
1,Very Poor Tape,I chose this rating as one side of the tape is NOT good. The sound is terrible and I can not understand the songs.
5,an Audiophile CD,"if you want to buy this CD from the Chesky Web Page, DON'T it will never arrive to you, but they will charge for it. in Amazon, I get it, and It's an amazing recording, if you have Tube's (Bulbos) it will sound Superb!!!"
4,good when it works.,Product came out together but the plastic oil jug was secure in the blades and it had a leak in it. It spilled all over the box. Had to buy another can of oil. The sensor speed stop working on the 2nd lawn cut. Had to tighted the line going to the motor. It works great when it does.
3,Lawn Boy Insight,"The mower is a great mower over all. We love Lawn Boy. It actually is our 3rd mower. However when this mower arrived there were several broken pieces on the handle. I had to order 4 parts from Lawn Boy, before I was actually able to use the mower. Was this item really inspetced before shipping?"
1,Lawn Boy Mower Model #10685,"Used it 3 times, the third time a grinding noise was heard and the drive would stop. I took it into a lawn boy approved service center which aftertwo days concluded that the transmission was rubbing against the rear drive wheels. He did not know how to repair it. Called the factory and within a day they gave a recommendation on how to fix it. He now had to order the parts. The repair is still in progress, I don't know whether it will like new or a rube goldberg type repair.I will demand a new mower if the repair is something less that a new mower. Of course my demanding a new mower is likely to be laughed off. We shall see. Will update this when I get my mower back, talk to the service guy and see how well it runs.I am really disappointed in Lawn Boy and Consumers Report ranked the model that I bought as a best buy.Chet Doerr"
1,Extremely unhappy with Marin Fig bars order!,"My order arrived open and very stale! Some of the packages were open and the fig bars were rock hard! I ordered them in good faith trusting the figs would as least be edible. I was not able to return this product either, totally wasting my money! There is a no return policy in fine print. I'm very dissatisfied with this 0rder! Online purchases should at the very least be returnable. I would have even purchase another product had I been given the chance to return this item. NOT GOOD AMAZON...NOT GOOD!"
4,From Radio to TV without missing a Beat,"I didn't think it was possible, to take a format that seemed perfect for Radio and to convert it into a TV Show without ruining what made the original so special.I was sure, This American Life, the TV show would be a show you could watch with the TV set off, but the speakers on, but instead it is a show that is visually and mentally appealing.Now if only Amazon.com would let me add it to my TIVO and not my just my desktop."
1,EXPIRATION DATES!! Be careful with grocery items!!,"I ordered a grocery item, the ""Wise Snacks Cheez Doodles, White Cheddar, 6.5-Ounce Bags"" (Pack of 15) at December 13 2006, i received this snacks at December 19 2006. When i checked the expiration date for consumption, it was DECEMBER 18 2006! I was astonished.When i tried to return this outdated item, the online Amazon form do not accept returns for grocery items (!!!!!).So i tried other solution to return this as a defective item.So, please, be careful when you order grocery items online. CHECK THE EXPIRATION DATE, as soon as you receive this kind of perishable products. But before that, try to know if it's possible to return this kind of items if doesn't good for consuption."
1,Trittbrettfahrer,"When books are successful,like Jules Vernes books were, some of us think we can use the character or name of that character that made the book successful and become equally succesful. That is true in this case. Maybe just a clever sales gimmick. Not as interesting as one would expect when hearing the name Nemo. Nemo was an Indian Prince and will remain an Indian Prince. His achievements were better known by Verne himself."
2,Extremely disappointed,"As others have said, Anderson describes Verne as a no-talent hack unable to come up with any original ideas without his periodic letters from Nemo. I find this especially ironic since Anderson has done nothing himself but tell synopses of Verne's work with only the barest of cohesion to fit into his storyline.The only redeeming virtue of this book s that it may inspire readers to explore Verne's orignal works for themselves."
3,"Interesting and Fun, but a bit slow","This book's premise is that all of Jules Verne's fiction was based on the real-life adventures of his friend, André Nemo. The beginning and ending are fairly interesting, but the middle of the book got a bit slow. I found myself reading it just to finish the book, rather than because I liked the story. Still, the underlying premise is unique, and Kevin J. Anderson is a good writer. This is a fun book."
2,Captain Nemo(The Fantastic History of a Dark Genius),The novel was amusing enough to complete but nothing great. It struck me as a sort of Disney version of Verne's characters and would probably make a fairly decent film for them. I haven't read the Jules Verne novels in years so I can't compare K.J. Anderson's story line to the Verne novels accurately. What this novel did do was spark an interest in me to go back to the original stories and reread them. For that alone I think the novel was worth reading.
1,Guess what? I Never Received the CD!!,"I was eagerly anticipating receiving these two Boyce & Hart discs remastered on CD, only to receive notification from Amazon that the quality of the physical CDs was so inferior (guess they were previously used, not new) they would not ship the product, and so my credit card wasn't charged. Anyone know where I can get this package new and shrinkwrapped?"
2,DOA,"Unfortunately this product was Dead on Arrival, we do have a second one that does fuction as advertised, but have concerns about quality control."
2,Poor Chinese quality control,"The TRENDnet 2-Port PS/2 KVM Switch Kit has a mouse function that doesn't work. By the time I found a second mouse so I could plug one into each computer, I decided it wasn't worth the cost of shipping to send the device back. The keyboard and video switch functions work fine."
3,Oh well,"It was fine for two weeks,hooked up a visa and me computers and was fine then the keyboard went out on it."
2,good for awhile,"worked great the first few times. then the blades dulled. unless your using the shotty plastic hair guides, its a pretty rough cut near or on the face."
1,If you use attachments move on,"I've been shaving my own head once a week with a Wahl contour for 8 years. During that time I had 3 boys that I also cut their hair using the 1/8 and 1/4 attachment. The motor finally pooped out so I looked online and ended up with this Andis. I'm gonna make a long story short. this thing is great if your never gonna use an attachment and your only gonna use it for 5min. It is one step below horrible at cutting with attachments and it gets very very hot after about 5-10min. I'm talking 3rd degree burn hot. With my old one I could cut mine and my three boys hair all in one sitting, but with this I have to stop half way through one head just to let it cool down. This is junk and I would throw it if it was still in one piece, but it burnt my hand for the last time yesterday and I smashed this crap on my driveway."
1,Worthless. Didn't last even a full year.,"I ordered this in December, 2010. I used it maybe three times, very moderately. Mostly for sideburns, getting around the ears, that sort of thing. Nothing intense. I plugged it in and turned it on summer of 2011 (just a matter of 6-8 months later) and... nothing. It is garbage. Buy something else that will last."
1,6 MONTHS LATER,This product worked well for 6you months then stopped. It worked well during its good days. The blades got off center and I have tried to realign them with no luck.
1,Garbage,"Terrible. Got one use out of it, and then the thing was useless. Awful product. Do not buy it, it's cheap crap even considering the price."
3,Not recommened,"It vibrates so violently, it will make your hand numb in seconds. I am a guy and I use power tools, even my power sander feels more quite in my hand than this trimmer. Powerful engine and good blade but poor design."
4,"very affordable, fast shipping","Compared with other clippers/ trimmers, this one is quite affordable. My only concern is how long it would last, as this clipper vibrates quite a bit"
5,LIVE IS BEST,"I simply love live albums where the crowd sings along ,it makes me feel , well , alive . Sure he can be anoying and vain , and yes I'd like to slap him on the head for his dumb rooster haircut , but , next to the Kinks , Rod was one of the best at getting the crowd to sing along on many songs .He gets the crowd singing Sailing , and it is beautiful .I am an older man now ,( i saw this tour at the Music Hall in Boston 22 or so years ago and it rocked -he had 3 guitar players ) and Young Turks still makes me feel like a kid again . I am always of the opinion that if only a couple of songs are magic , it is worth it to buy a c d that makes you feel good. But there are more than just two good songs ,Gasoline Alley is real good .I Don't Want to Talk About is a great sing along as well."
1,Poor service,I was not able to buy what I wanted even after emails and phone calls. I still need to buy the items
1,MISMATCHED COLOR,"THESE SS LOCK RINGS ARE NOT COMPLETELY STAINLESS!! I MOUNTED THE LOWER HALF (STAINLESS), PUT THE SCOPE ON ..... WHEN I WENT TO ATTACH THE TOP HALF (RINGS) I NOTICED THEY ARE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MATERIAL & COLOR. THE RINGS APPER TO BE A NICKLE SILVER WITH A SILVER/BRONZE FINISH!! IT LOOKED LIKE CRAP. I AM RETURNING."
5,"Francesca, a daughter of (South) America","This recording is an example about the talented and magic artists that South America produce. Francesca Ancarola, with an espectacular voice, has build on this record a bridge between the chilean traditional music and the jazz music, and also she has ""blend"" the languages to keep the sense of the lyrics, and transport its poetic adventure to new ears. Each song is an invitation, each musical arrange is a special mixture to enjoy and share...Francesca have five previous productions in her country. She has explore differents musical styles: traditionals rythms from Chile, Peru, Mexico and Brazil, and also author-music (Victor Jara, Violeta Parra, Djavan, etc.).Ricardo I."
1,Not great,"Not impressed with the movie. It was slow and strange. I bought it along with ""Searching for Bobby Fisher"" and was greatly dissapointed. After two viewings (I thought I had missed something the first time) it will forever be collecting dust on my DVD rack."
3,DISSAPOINTS THUG FANS EVERYWHERE,"i have every thps and thug and i may never get another thug again. this is a HUGE DISSAPOINMENT to any tonyhawk fans.i must admit the new features are prety cool but i excpected more from the levels, i mean the levels suck! and the game mode is confusing.THE SKINNY: dont waste your money on this, get the sims2 or somethin else, TRUST ME!!!!!!!!!!btw, the gurls are fine in it, oh should not hav said that now ever1'z gonna buy thug..."
3,its alright,all im going to tell you is that you have to play the first under ground then you can play it and also it is a different twist than the first one
2,Disagree,"The ""liberal"" apporach of this book ignores the human cost of policies implemented at the macroeconomic level. There is more to development, such as equity and human advancement, not just economic aggregates."
3,you,this product didn't stop my puppy from chewing things. it did however distract him from chewing...so if you redirected like 100 times a day it would work. but this product stopped him for a short amount of time then start again.
2,Didn't work!,"I have used this product in the past for ferrets and it worked great. However, it did not even phase my 8 month old Golden retriever. I sprayed/saturated it onto his extendable leash and he still chewed right through it like there was nothing even on it!"
4,Works,But our dog seemed to get used to the taste. It's more effective when it hasn't been used for a while.
3,Bitter Apple Spray,"My female dog was biting her feet a lot and causing her nails to be sharp and thin. After spraying the bitter apple on all paws, she has stopped the habit and it didn't seem to affect her fur or skin. I really love the product"
3,not sure if it really works have to try it more,"tried this product on my rug and the next day my dog kept chewing on the rug...not sure if the material stays on the rug or not but had to keep re-spraying,,,did not really work with my dog."
5,a must have for a new puppy!,We were advised to buy this for a new puppy and what great advice it was! We just spray this where he is chewing and it stops! We've put it on our furniture and anything that he chews that he shouldn't chew. I just bought a second bottle! (Note: we have a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy)
4,Super Fast Shipping!,I received this product 2 days after I ordered it! Super fast and the product really works well. I just wish it lasted a bit longer. I spray it on my shoes about every couple of days and it keeps my beagle at bay. Great product and great seller.
1,Only Makes the Dog Lick More!,"I bought this product because our little mini-poodle was constantly licking his paws, causing him to cough. It was recommended by the Vet. We used this product according to the directions, and the dog ""loved it"" which made him lick his paws much more! WOULD NOT recommend this product if you will be using it for the same purpose."
1,If it sounds too good to be true...,"I, like melissak, put WAY too much hope in these bottles of spray. I was honestly and really thinking that this spray would keep my puppy away from the wood she so dearly loves to gnaw. Wrong. I am not sure why I put all of my hope eggs in this bitter apple spray basket...if this spray worked for all dogs, wouldn't everyone use it?! And wouldn't every puppy come with a bottle? Or would people have to order the combo puppy with spray bottle and Kong? Anyway...I sprayed the, um, spray on the wooden furniture. My puppy sniffed it, walked away, came back to gnaw some more. Bummer. I think that the efficacy of the spray depends on the tastebuds of the dog. My puppy happens to believe that mulch, cigarette butts, rocks, and other disgusting sundried items on the sidewalk taste absolutely delish so maybe this bitter apple is like dessert for her."
4,Works ok but may need help,"I got a Collie that some people were just going to take to the pound. I couldn't let that happen and kept the little puppy. My fiance did not want a dog and she chewed everything. So, I had to fix that quick. I bought this and it kind of worked. If she really wanted something, she still went for it. So, I watched this trainer video and he said sometimes you need to have the dog really hate the bitter spray and to hold a sprayed cotton ball inside your dog's mouth for 2-3 minutes. So, I tried that and did it twice a day for two days. Just held my puppy and put the sprayed cotton in her mouth (between her front teeth). By the end she hated it and I could just spray something with no worries. A year later it still works and I'm really glad because now she is having hot spot problems."
4,Positive results,"I used this to keep my cats from using the carpeting as there scratching post. Does work but you have to use on on regular basis,(every day to every other day). Does not stain or have any ill effect to carpeting as well as the kitty's."
5,Worked Great for Two Different Breeds,"Two different dogs seemed to love chewing on our laundry room cabinets and this worked as a GREAT deterrent. One was a Labradoodle and the other, a German Shepherd mix, one young and one old. I was reading the reviews here and I guess it depends on the breed - we also literally soaked the cabinets with this stuff and it didn't harm the wood at all. Someone has also suggested using it as a digging deterrent. I think it's worth a shot to try it, also sold in local pet stores. Good luck!"
5,Beyond Politics,"This is the first book that I have read of James Carville and it was absolutely facinating. Even though he is know for his hard lined political rhetoric, this book explained to me the meaning of Loyality which, in my generation, is apparently not taught in schools anymore. I came away with a great sense of feeling, I need to do more, especially with my everyday relationships. I am eagerly awaiting Mr. Carville's next book."
2,Carville is treading water here,"This book reminds me of a typical Saturday Night Live movie: one good joke and 85 minutes of filler. The story of Carville's history with the Clintons and why he defended them is interesting and well-written. Unfortunately, once told, Carville needed to write over a hundred more pages in order to have a book-length volume. At almost every juncture where he could have written something insightful about loyalty (like his marriage to a very partisan Republican and his love for his racist grandmother), he rarely fails to back away, throw his hands in the air with a ""gosh, ain't that weird?"" sort of attitude, and leave it at that. If you're a hard-core partisan Democrat, you might like it just because it hits all the right spots by beating up on nearly every prominent Republican in sight. But that's not exactly tough, and other books like ""Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot"" do the same thing, but with humor and more than ten minutes of research."
3,It had its moments,"I was a tad disappointed in this book. It definitely had it's moments, but for the most part I found myself skimming through a lot of it just so I could get it over with. I'm not giving up though, I'll try the next book in the series. Although, I don't understand how this book is related to the Simply series it all. It did not have any connection to the first three books whatsoever, which I will admit, was disappointing."
4,Has lasted a long time! But a little too light weight.,"This has lasted the cattle dog mix a year! The jack russell is not interested in it since it is not something with a heartbeat to chase. We leave it in the fenced yard year round and it has faded but still in one piece. It gets carried around a lot by the cattle dog mix (even by pinching the middle fabric part which looks really funny), but for some reason there is no interest in chewing to destroy this flyer. I have never been good at throwing flyers and find the extreme light weight of this flyer a bit of a challenge, but it gets the job done for play time. We have been very happy with the product.**************************UPDATE: After about two years in the sun this toy finally died of UV exposure. The fabric section finally just tore apart one day. A great price here on Amazon for this product which lasted us two years. We will definitely reorder."
5,Ask My Dog,I personally do not know how good or bad this floppy disc is but I do know that my dog refuses to play with any other kind.
2,"LOVE these frisbees, hate the new material","I went off the photo in this ad thinking I would get that version of The booda frisbee. Sadly, I got the new version, in its new packaging...I have been using booda frisbees for years and every since they changed packaging recently the quality has gone down expanentially. My dog took not but two days to rip the middle of one of these new packaged ones, yet the old version ones are still intact after month of hard frisbee use.Not happy that the fabrics have changed, and the old packaging was SO much better. Plus the design on the frisbee was better too.The frisbee design and flight is still great!! Just te quality of the fabric and the stitching is horrible compared to before :("
1,Not enough power for me,"I purchased this for use as a shaver. Because of sensitive skin (I get a rash when I use a razor or electric shaver) and ingrown hair, I use beard trimmers to shave.I found three problems with it. First, it doesn't shave close - of course, this may not matter to those who simply want it for beard trimming. But also, it has little power. It really has a tough time with stubble even a few days old. Finally, the battery contacts keep coming loose - I have to open the battery compartment to adjust them.I'm still searching for a good trimmer (the ones I've had are now dead!)."
3,ok....,"It is an OK product, It says 5 speed but I couldn't figure out where the other 4 speeds are! I would rate it 3/5 because it is easy to use and less noisy."
4,It worked well for me,Bits and bytes - as long as the data travels I'm happy. This optical cable has served me well and I have no qualms recommending it to anyone.
1,I probably would have liked the product...,"I never received my product from the seller and had to submit a claim to Amazon. It was a Christmas gift so that made me very upset. The person would have probably liked the cologne but I guess well never know. However, Amazon was very prompt and helpful."
4,"Seems Like ""Three's A Crowd""","This book was very interesting, detailing in full the behind-the-scenes conflicts, including the much ballyhooed incident with Suzanne Somers. But what I find most extraordinary is that the author gets EVERYONES side on this one...he doesn't take sides, just presents both arguements and lets the readers decide who was right or wrong. There is an episode guide at the end, which is an added plus, but what I enjoyed was that Chris Mann spent his time discussing the cast and the problems they were facing, not describing in detail the episodes we have all seen many times. ""Three's Company"" is still an entertaining show, but I can watch it anytime...however, it's not often I can read about what happened that viewers couldn't see. Chris Mann did a great job of giving the public the information they wanted, and I must give him credit for gaining the cooperation of the entire cast, which seems unheard of these days."
4,holds my stands perfectly,- they fit- the padding is well done- I've had it with an end loading bag- quality feel and strong fabric- on-stage stands is a trusted name in their field
5,Music People Carry Bag - Excellent product,"I use this Music People bag to carry my photographic light stands and assorted light modifiers. The bag is approximately 50 x 10 x 5"" inches and appears to be very well made. Very happy with purchase and would recommend to others."
3,Beware! It won't fit a regular speaker stand!,"The bag is sturdy just like my other on stage light truss bag, but it is too short for my speaker stand or my on stage light stand. The problem with the seller is because they did not put the dimension in the description. Frustrated buyer! I will just use this one for my microphone stands."
3,"Great album, strange gaps between tracks.","Always wanted to get this album and when it was on sale on AMP3 I jumped on it.The sound is what I'd expect for a live album from that era, and who doesn't enjoy hearing Ronnie tear into some Ozzy Sabbath!! (Dio is my and always will be my favorite Sabbath vocalist)The reason for the low rating is that when I copied the tracks to iTunes it still has annoying gaps that totally ruins the flow of the album. :(I still listen to it, but would of rather purchases the CD for the seamless flow.\^^/ DIO \^^/"
1,"Wrong version of ""Mob Rules""","Be aware that the ""Mob Rules"" track presented in this MP3 version of the album is actually the studio version from the Mob Rules album. If you compare to the Rules of Hell box set you can hear the actual live track that is supposed to be here."
1,Worst book ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I really enjoyed all books Archer Christifori was in until this one. This really doesn't potray the awesome work that the author can uaually pump out. This Is a toatly unrealistic book ranging from 3 regiments up from usual one they had in the other two books about Archer. They really should've coutinued with the entriguing civil war instead of this boring topic of the falcon invasion. Much better stuff can be read {like the warrior series.} Read this only if you have $...sitting around or don't care about realistic settings and numbers. Only read if in dire need of Battletch serries or else skip this piecie of bad litirture.
2,Faron Young's non-Essential,"What a disappointment this Canadian release of the singing sheriff is, it's not the classic songs of Faron Young this compilation lacks but the quality of the sound, for which there is no quality. I can't understand why this record company didn't remaster these classics, and do this great artist an injustice like this, not to mention this is a fairly new release. This is not the Faron Young essential, this is just a false title, so, take my advice and purchase Faron Young's complete Capitol hits double disc compilation instead, a few more bucks but well worth it, I think still available at Amazon. (I wonder if Amazon will give me a refund.)"
3,Piercing blue beacon painfully ruins your dark adaptation,"It is true that they turn on and off with the ambient light level, but they sadly failed to mention the color of the light. The piercing blue is painfully bright, far too bright for the middle of the night. What was so wrong with the warm, muted glow of more traditional night lights that it needed this improvement? While the wasted expense was not large enough to be tragic, the hunt for the new and improved night light must continue."
3,It was ok,"Light given off was good but not adequate enough for my small hallway, I replaced it with the 4 watt night light that it was replacing. It would be ok as a reference light(oh the kitchen is over there), not a very dim (don't trip on the kids toys) hall light."
1,dead after 1 1/2 years,"I would expect a LED light to last for quite some time, but ours has started strobing after 1 1/2 years, and feels quite warm (perhaps it was this warm before, but I never had reason to feel it). The strobing is very distracting, and coupled with the heat-up, has made me unplug this. Would not buy again."
4,A good movie,"In spite of all the bad talk I had heard about this movie, I personally thought it was good and the soundtrack was also good."
3,not reviewed,I could not play this dvd on any of my 3 dvd players. No picture a pop up saying wrong region. Can i get another copy or my money back.
5,Awesome!,"Go and Sin no more is without a doubt a awesome, dynamic book! Perfect for anyone who satan has been messing around with you and you'd like to see freedom. Freedom that can only be gained in Christ. This book gives a call of holiness to the church, and is very well one of the best books I've read this year."
3,"Rude, obnoxious support","The computer works fine, small, quite fast. Heat seems to be a problem. The phone support is useless and the person who called himself Brad shouldn't have any contact with costumers- he is disgrace for Acer."
2,Illustrated International Pick-Up and Scout Buyer's Guide,Illustrated International Pick-Up and Scout Buyer's Guide (Motorbooks International Illustrated Buyer's Guide)
4,Mannix Fifth Season,"This was an above-average mystery series, carried almost solely by Mike Connors; by the fifth season, he was completely identified with Mannix, and it's a delight to see his ease in this role. Highly recommended!"
4,Alot of stuff but vary thin in some areas,A large range of topics were covered from VBA techniques to multiuser security but many things mentioned in the book weren't given enough time. A more indepth look on many instances would have made it more informative. Trying to say too much can make you say too little.
2,not a true monster cable,"If you are after a knock off monster ""brand"" cable this ones for you. I was dissapppointed and returned the product as it was not a true Monster cable as lead to believe."
3,Delightful reading,"The book is romantic and charming. I enjoyed it because it was written by a prostitute and she explained her life as a human being. Whereas most books treat prostitutes as abtract objects being studied by an out of touch intellectual. I was delighted at the content and found it to be enjoyable reading. However, the interpretation of the poetry to English forces it to loose its rhyme and the poems seem weak on depth. If you are reading it for quality poetry, you would be best off reading other classics. The poems simply give a window into this facisnating woman's life. They are not artfully written poems, they are just amazing because they were written in a time period when women were not supposed to be educated."
2,Well...,"This author seems to rely on secondhand accounts and the book seems more of an attack against non-Christians than anything else. Yes, this book is definitely written from a Christian viewpoint, and as such is a bit biased. It never even mentions the possibility that such activities may be beneficial, or that practitioners of such things as Wicca are genuinely happy. I personally know no one who has been possessed or driven to suicide because of the board. Read such books at your own discretion, but please keep an open mind; this is not the only view, or the only way."
5,one of the the best kungfu movie ever made,"This is a most see movie for kungfu lover all over the world.You have to see it to know what we are talking about.I watch this monie at least 15times already,I'm still not tired of it.It's just an amazing film.Movies are not made like this anymore."
3,Almost 5 Stars,"the fight scene between the actual monkey and cobra deserves two stars by itself. without that original scene the movie lacks big tyme, if anyone knows where i can get the original movie(un-cut) please hit me at cjmartin7@yahoo.com."
5,Simple organizer,"Nice battery organizer, especially for the price. With a guick glance you can easily keep check on your spare batteries. Well made and can either be wall mounted or placed in a drawer."
4,Battery tester is missing,"This is my second reviewReceived my new rack. It has the tester, which is nice and it is 95% perfect. One of the c battery slots is too tight but still holds the battery. All others are fineI'm getting tired of not receiving items that I order and then having to deal w/return labels, etc. the battery tester it pretty critical for this purchase so I'm not happy it is missing. Regarding other reviews, I will say I tried AA battery in a few slots and it fits fine."
4,"Handy and sturdy, not very flashy","It holds a lot of batteries, which is nice. However, some batteries fit more snugly than others, so it'd be nice if the holes were slightly larger. The plastic is pretty sturdy, nothing special. I have mine sitting in a drawer to keep batteries organized as opposed to hanging up. I'm too concerned that with all of the weight from the batteries that it'd fall off the wall and make a huge racket. The battery tester is small and pretty handy, but is useless on rechargeables. I have a bunch of rechargeables that no longer work, and the tester still reads them as being full. Batteries that are drained are read as full. For alkalines, it seems to work well. Unfortunately, I primarily use rechargeables. Overall, the product does what it's supposed to do, but it's not going to blow your socks off or anything."
5,Perfect,"Grabbed this as a storage rack so I could get the batteries out of the kitchen junk drawer. For it's price, a great Storage unit to have. Testing the battery power is not as easy as it looks. You just have to get the battery right on the correct position."
4,Nice,"Works great, looks nice (as pictured), and very convenient. Makes finding your batteries a snap. Every house should have one!"
2,Did not work x2,"First one worked great for a day, tested all my batteries, filled it up and it seemed fine. The next day tried to test some loose batteries,and nothing, maybe they were dead, but then checked the new batteries from previous day, again, no reading. Exchanged it and the new one was also defective. This one at least tested D, C and 9 volt batteries ok, but would not register AA and AAA which is what I would use it for most. These batteries were brand new and working fine in remotes, flashlights, etc. The storage part is handy, too bad it doesn't work right."
3,Works Fairly Well.....,The gauge and valve work fairly well. The chuck is a bit touchy and needs to be applied PERFECTLY on the valve stem to obtain a reading. I wonder if this item is really worth four times the price of the Harbor Freight unit.
5,A most unusual ghost story...,"When orphaned Peggy Grahame goes to live with her Uncle Enos in the old Grahame ancestral home, the past comes alive. The ghosts of her ancestors come and tell her about their lives in the Revolution, while actual current events mirror those of their pasts.Barbara Grahame, the most frequent ghostly visitor, is an independent and intelligent young woman living in the American Revolution. Her interaction with the extraordinarily clever British officer, Peaceable Sherwood is very enjoyable to read...particularly as Peaceable is nemesis of Barbara's brother, Dick (a young captain fighting for American independence). At the same time, serving to frame the story, Peggy uncovers mysteries of the past, and is led to her own romance with a young man from England.A very unusual and thoughtful Revolution story with possibly the best ghosts I've ever read about."
2,What Once Was,"I think Sheldon Patinkin has done an excellent job of illustrating what the Second City once was, and what it has now become, a corporate entity. I saw a terrific show there when I was in Chicago a few years ago, and at the end of it an actor did a fabulous rant about all the infiltration of corporate America. Blasting corporate icons like Starbucks and Blockbuster Video, and how they are stripping America of its individuality. He even got people to cut up their Blockbuster Cards! After reading the second half of this book, it is clear that Second City has become what it is trying to subvert. They seem to be looking to open a new theater wherever they can. And that seems very sad to me. What was once the Harvard of comedy, is now just another string of community colleges. Why try to aspire to greatness, when you can just wait for them to open up a Second City in your town. The book is about comedy, but it's really an American tragedy."
4,Great for comedy fans,"If you are already a fan of Second City -- or of comedy in general -- this is a very entertaining and informative book, containing many nuggets that elucidate the overwhelming impact Second City has had on comedy in the US. But if you know nothing about them, it is not the greatest introduction. It doesn't give a real sense of the improv process. It is accompanied by two CDs of performances. The CD of the early years has pretty bad sound, and some of the performances are dated. THe second CD is great."
4,Review of Model-assisted Survey sampling,"A great reference for survey sampling results. Derivations are mathematically rigorous and not for the faint of heart! I would not suggest this book for beginning grad students, as it is lacking somewhat in readability."
5,LOVE THIS MOVIE AND GOT IT FOR A GREAT PRICE!,Out of all the Scrooge movie that I have seen. I this this one is the best. loved it!
3,"Scrooge,..boo!","In the musical drama Scrooge the songs really took awaty from the story and the thought that Dicken's wanted to pursue in his story The Christmas Carol. Despite the director keeping the old dialoge alive, the songs are what killed the show. The events were not chronologically in order; they did although keep the same concept. The songs were distasteful yet they add excitement to the original story. Scrooge's transition was not only emotional, it was also physical. Near the end of the production, Scrooge's face became rosier and his eyes glistened. The director left many important details out of the movie. He also added thoughs suck as Scrooge in the Santa Claus costume. The actor who played Scrooge portrayed his character very well. While this is not an exact duplicate of The Christmas Carol, it is the appropriate version to express Christmas joy."
5,Scrooge,Loved this version of The CHRISTmas Carol. It's a fun musical with the same great message!!! I would recommend it to all who love this story.
5,I would like to see the DVD too!,This story has always been very special to me. This movie has become a tradition in our household around the holiday season. Having a DVD will only ensure that it will always remain a tradition around Christmas for us. I can only hope that Santa will hear my request!
5,Scrooge ~ VHS ~ Albert Finney,"If you like musicals and even if you don't, this is ""THE"" Scrooge video of all time. My husband does not like musicals, however, Albert Finney plays such a delightful character in the role of Scrooge, that he is absolutely entertained by it. Albert Finney makes Scrooge become the ""villain"" that you love to hate!It has become a Christmas tradition in our home and now that my children are gone from the nest, they are requesting their own copies for Christmas. Even when I don't have the time to sit down to watch it, the music is so lovely that I sometimes put it on and just listen to it while I wrap gifts or make christmas cookies and it really fills the house with christmas ""spirit."" (no pun intended) IT'S THE BEST!"
5,Best Scrooge movie ever,"This has been my favorite Scrooge (and holiday) movie since childhood when my parents first taped it off the TV back in the very early 80s when newfangled cable and VCRs made that possible (and when the movie was shown on TV in the U.S. about once a decade). I've loved it ever since.Very well acted, and the music is infectious (one song, Thank You Very Much, was nominated for an Academy Award and made it to a Visa commercial a holiday season or two ago). The wardrobe and sets look 19th century-ish and gritty enough, and Albert Finney as Scrooge and Sir Alec Guinness as the ghost of Marley are incredible.I was floored and very excited when I saw that it was getting a blu-ray release. I can't review the blu-ray edition yet, of course, but if it's only half as good as other oldies-on-bluray, it's going to be a welcome upgrade."
2,Scrooge,"Scrooge - It was received in a timely manner, however when inserted into the DVD it read ERROR. I was very dissappointed as I had the whole family ready to watch as we do every year."
1,Wouldn't play in my region and I had to return at my cost.,I live in California and ordered this DVD which wouldn't play in my region. Had to return it at my cost when they knew it was only for Region 2 (Calif is Region 1 as I've since learned). When I tried to contact them I got the same old tired message which was overcome by events (computers can't think!). No more business for them from me!
1,ghastly!,"I am astonished at the number of glowing reviews for this DREADFUL version of Dicken's classic. Even Mr Magoo's version is better. Certainly Alister Sim's version is the best. This one is appalling! I couldn't believe how bad it was. Dreadful, embarrassingly bad acting, terrible songs, beastly supporting cast. While I love Alec Guinness, he should have his Oscars revoked for this stinker. I had originally bought an extra copy to give to a friend, but my daughter and I watched it together and threw out the extra copy as simply too awful to give to anyone else. Yech! Yet I recognize that 480 5 star reviews to 5 bad reviews are pretty long odds. I think I will have to watch it again this season to see if it is just as bad as it was last year."
5,Beautiful Update!,We've worn through one VHS of this movie. I was excited to see it offered on Blu-Ray! The picture and sound were great!
4,Scrooge sings,this is a delightful version of a Christmas Carol. If you like musicals then this is one for your collection. It is a traditional story of Scrooge and the ghosts and ultimate redemption of a man who appears to be beyond hope. A great movie for the entire family to enjoy together.
5,A message of salvation,This is the best version of A Christmas Carol I have ever seen. We've seen it so many times the tape is wearing out. The message of salvation and love for you neighbor comes through loud and clear. Two thumbs up!
2,Scrooge Review--Skylar and Daniel,"We have recently read the novel A Christmas Carol and followed it up by watching the movie Scrooge. We felt that the excessive amount of songs took away from the mood at a certain point. For example, when Scrooge is with the Ghost of Christmas Future it's supposed to be a serious moment in which Scrooge realizes that he is dead and then the town breaks into a joyous song. The acting was very uncharacteristic and made the story less interesting. We felt that the actor playing Scrooge did not fit the description and therefore made Scroode more pleasant than he is supposed to be. The quality of the movie was lower due to the lack of advances in technology. The picture quality was poor because of it being made long ago. The final song, finale, was drawn out too long. It made the ending less meaningful. Overall, the mavie would be better without the musical layout."
5,Holiday Happiness,This is a great holiday classic and should be seen by all who love the CHRISTMAS SEASON.
1,A whole lot of nothing....,"The format seems nice, but the game is SO very boring. It is very hard, but not rewarding when you pass a level."
1,"Beautiful graphics, difficulty is insane","I had high hopes for this game, and they were met for the first couple of levels. After 3 hours on the fourth level however, I gave up. The difficulty of this game is ridiculous. The fact that there were 20 someodd levels after that, which I assume get more difficult, mean this game is destined for ebay. Designers should realize games are meant to be fun, not frustrating. The ability to save in a level may have helped."
5,A Cinch for LumiQuest products,I got this Cinch Strap in conjunction with the LumiQuest ProMax Mini SoftBox and the LumiQuest ProMax Pocket Bouncer and I personally feel that this is a great 'package' for shooting images of people in a room or outdoors.This Cinch Strap I felt beneficial as I did not want to place the included double-sticky-back hook-n-loop Velcro(tm) directly onto the flash head.This strap takes care of that issue for me in that it straps around the flash unit head and fastens to itself and then the various flash diffusers attach to it.I found the combined price and ease of use as well as aesthetics to be well worth it.It gets a great THUMBS UP!! from me.
2,Almost useless,I bought this with the ProMax System and it just does not hold in place. I did not want to put velcro on my flash but thats what I had to do. I will still use this but only to keep the ProMax System tight on the flash.
5,New Living Translation,I really enjoy reading it daily from my Kindle! Would recommend it to anyone. The version is so easy to read.
3,Navigation,"Navigation to the verse you wants take at least seven steps. One would think there would be a way to simply enter the Book, Chapter and Verse but there isn't."
2,wish it had better navigation,"wish it had better navigation.I didn't realise it would have bad navigation- and i can't jump to the sections quick enough, especially when using it in church. This is very frustrating but i can use it at home which is great for adding comments.I also hoped it would be able to quickly look up keywords/passages, but also not a very good function."
5,Great Kindle Book,"I read some of the reviews saying the words were hard to read, but I'm in my 20s and I didn't think so. Love it!"
2,Very disapointed,I love the NLT 1996 print copy of the NLT I have and was excited to get it for my new Kindle. Finding Book and Chapter was ok but Verse is imposable to jump to and the verse #'s have no space between them and they are hard to find and confusing with the verse and Text. Once you are on a page other than the Chapter title page there is no way to tell where you are Book or chapter and you clippings don't indicate Book/Chapter either. I hope a more user friendly version comes soon.
5,My favorite Bible translation,"I was in Russia in January several years ago. It was very cold and I had left my Bible at home in the USA. I connected to the internet and went to an online link to the NLT and started reading Galatians. It was so exciting, that I just couldn't stop reading. I ordered a copy from Amazon so that it would be at my home when I returned to the USA. It gave me insight that I had never known before in reading the Bible. I often find something new and say to myself, ""the Bible doesn't say that"" so I get our my NKJV to check it out only to find that that's exactly what the NKJV says. I have since read through the NLT more than twice and I just love the clarity of it. I also like the Giant print. Give it a try on the internet. It is excellent reading for those not stuck on the KJV. I still keep my KJV and NKJV to test new discoveries. I've given several of these as gifts."
1,Bible review,OK as a book but not as a Bible to be able to go back and forth with. Insufficient flexability. I prefer an App that I purchased separately as a superior tool to use in church or bible study.
2,Not what I ordered.,"I thought this was the NLT. It says NLT on the cover, but it is actually The Living Bible, not The New Living Translation. I would like to return it for another Bible."
3,NLT Bible,"I bought this Bible because it came up when I searched for ""Large print"", however it is small print. Also, I don't like the fact that Jesus' words arent highlighted in red. Otherwise it's a very nice hard cover version."
3,Satisfactory,"Can't add to the NLTse, it's my favourite version. But it could be a little more intuitive in navigation for the Kindle. But having said that, it's not too clunky though."
1,Not properly formatted.,"I don't understand why the prose portions of the text are not properly justified. Neither do I understand that Christ's words are in very light grey, making them hard to read.I asked for a reimbursement.Edit: Amazon asked me to delete the file and it's right now in the process of reimbursing the money back to my account. Great for Amazon."
3,Encyclopedia of Computer codes,"This book is really an encyclopedia of computer codes, and as such gives a cursory overview of apparatus and their problems. Is a bit long and wordy if you're trying to get to a specific problem on a specific vehicle. Might be helpful to those wanting a general overview."
3,Pretty good,"This book had a nice plot, but the wording the author chose was for little kids. And some of the horse information wasn't correct. It was also pretty predictable. A good read if you're bored, but its mainly for younger kids."
3,A great book,"It was great it was a little bit of a thriller and very emotional and I wanted to cry, when she wanted to but I had to keep my eyes open so I could read it !!!"
4,Very good book with a good message!!!!!!,"This book is great for animal lovers, horse lovers (like me) especially. It's written very well and has a great message about how God will always love you, no matter what. I enjoyed reading this and I can't wait to read the restbof the series. This is NOT anything against the author, but if you are someone who reads a lot or are a fast reader, you might want to find another book if you are looking for a longer book to read."
2,Not enough background.,"This book contains some excellent poetry in it that is worth reading. The introduction to the book is a fascinating attempt to explain the Romantic Era as a reaction to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The problem is that the book does not include very much information about the individual poets, or the poems themselves. There are only a few mentionings confined to the introduction, which is not enough. The Romantic Era is a period during which it is especially important to have information about the authors and poems, whose lives were often fascinating in their own."
3,bummer,"I exspected much much more from this DVD. #1- he acted weird, like he was on something, #2- his voice was off, he was trying to hard and #3- thirdly he sat through the DVD. I don't think this concert had high energy only he seemed high. he talked way to much. I am going to try another Meatloaf DVD and let this one sit and gather dust. hope this helps you, it would have me."
3,esperaba algo mejor de un artista tan destacado,"No es la gran cosa, la calidad de la interpretación de meat loaf siempre es muy buena pero esperaba algo de manera espectacular."
2,Edited Masterpieces,"I saw this and thought, ""Great!"", two-on-one and a great price. Well, they neglected to tell anyone that their ""ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED"" versions are edits on the Masterpiece portion. Granted, A Song For You is complete but I ALREADY HAD this CD and I wanted Masterpiece as it was originally released. Talk about shady advertising. The Tempts sound great, but this is not the Masterpiece it should be."
2,"The Temptations Masterpiece, Indeed!","MASTERPIECE was indeed their greatest triumph in my book as a total ""urban"" album. The lead track, ""Masterpice"" is a lament, but a lyrical and hypnotic one, and the infectious rhythm of this tune will haunt you forever. It is powerful lyrically, and strangely beautiful! Every song, from Plastic Man to Hurry Tomorrow is heart wrenching and yet will have your fingers snapping... HOWEVER... this album, though well engineered has nearly every song on the Masterpiece album cut... and this is inexcusable. ""A Song for You"" is nearly all forgettable.... so why bother putting that album all on the CD intact? Masterpiece was a masterpiece and should have been the spotlight here!!"
4,Not a Bad Start,"I liked the way the exercises built upon oneanother.Each progressive exercise reviews words and phrases from previous lessons; great reinforcement technique.About the only think I didn't care much for was the fact that this WESTERN series contains/teaches a lot of EASTERN words and language. A Western Armenian friend of mine listened to the tape and was very disappointed that a good portion of the WESTERN tape was actually EASTERN Armenian langiuage.Still, however, it's a good intorduction and no one will laugh at you if you master the EASTERN/WESTERN words. They'll just be jazzed that you know anything about the language at all!"
5,An excellent summation of Johnny's career,"This collection of Johnny's greatest hits contains almost all of the top 10 hits with a few top 10 hits missing. This is the place to look for ""Lookin' For Love,"" and ""Cherokee Fiddle,"" if you don't want to buy the Urban Cowboy Soundtrack or if you want to hear some of his other hits. This is essential Urban Cowboy era country music. Beware of Curb Records' cheaper compilation of Johnny's music as it contains mostly non-hits with only Lookin' For Love and Cherokee Fiddle being the hits, this is the disc to buy instead as it is affordable and as I said earlier, contains most of his top 10 hits."
4,Good Way for Kids to Have Fun w Hoops,"The game is not particularly hard, but that's exactly why I got it for my 5-year-old. He loves it and thinks the pros as kids are funny. It has helped attach him to the sport in general. You can ratchet up the difficulty as needed so I don't find that to be a problem. The graphics are solid though limited. I guess that's the biggest knock in that most things are limited. There aren't too many moves, the commentators get stale fast and there is not a whole lot of variation. Still this is done mostly to keep kids from being overwhelmed. A fun game to pick up for $20 for your b-ball loving child."
1,"100,000 light hours FALSE!","I have had these for 3 months and am very disappointed, neither unit works anymore. I do not live in a cave so it's not like they ran 24/7. I would not waste my money on these, the old fashion lights work much better."
3,Good price but so-so value,"Bought the three-pack. The lights work but the sensor is not especially good - the theater-style light blinks/flashes if the light in the room is not quite bright enough. Overall, they are OK."
2,Poor quality,"I purchased 3 of these lights from Lowes. In less than 6 months, 2 of the 3 units died. Don't waste your money on these. Made in China = poor quality."
4,Gotta Love Wendy!,"Wendy Wasserstein, the acerbic, often-hilarious Pulitzer-Prize winning playwright, brings her trademark dry humor to this sweet collection of essays. Ms. Wasserstein writes what she knows about-theatre, New York City, looking for love, trying to lose weight, friends, and making the decision to have her first child at the age of 48.Many of these essays are magical, but could be an acquired taste. For those of you who love biting autobiographical satire can look no further."
5,The Fog of War,"This is just the right item for anyone interested in learning what McNamara's intentions and personal drives were as he counseled Presidents Kennedy and Johnson regarding the Viet Nam war. He comes a hairs breadth from actually apologizing. Perhaps he will apologize before he passes away from us entirely, but we get the sense that to do so would destroy him. Clearly his acts have eaten away at the man."
4,"mein fuhrer, i can walk again!","the oscar winning documentary studies the career of robert strange mcnamara, savior of ford motor company, architect of the viet nam war, patron saint of the golbalization economy, self-justifier par excellence, and (imho) one of the greatest villains of the 20th century. (ok, hes not on a level with stalin or hitler or walter o'malley, but hes close). the film manages to remain even handed about its subject, something i would never be able to do, and on that level it should be appreciated. i think his fans will come away seeing him as a tragically flawed hero, and his detractors (like me) will come away seeing him as the vile [...] he is. the movie demands that you think, and for that alone it should be seen by any person interested in americas role in the world."
5,thought provoking,bob mcnamara was the secretary of defense in the jfk administration. mr. mcnamara recounts his life in interviews in this film. his accounts of his service to jfk are fascinating and very moving. i purchased this film with instant video on amazon prime. i am now watching it on my pc. check this film out. happy shopping. aloha haleiwa jon
5,Macnamara,"The Fog of War is a obligatory documentary. Enlights what happens behind the scenes, well made. I strongly recommend."
5,A magnificent accomplishment,"This is one of the finest documentaries I have ever seen, and Errol Morris is to be commended for having the vision and foresight to record, in full, the McNamara story while it was still possible. It is both enlightening and chilling, far more compelling than some of the trite documentaries that have found their way to the screen in recent years. This is one to watch."
2,Do your homework - by tablets instead,"Don't believe the hype on capsules. Read articles like this: http://www.vmcs.com/spindel/amino.html#06 Then check your bank account and common sense. Pay more for 67% less if you wish. :) I recommend these instead: http://www.amazon.com/Optimum-Nutrition-Superior-Amino-Tablets/dp/B000GIPIVC/sr=8-3/qid=1164340682/ref=sr_1_3/103-9470331-7743861?ie=UTF8&s;=groceryThe math: $23 and 325 tablet doses of 2,222 milligrams vs 2-3 capsules (bottle count 300 caps) so only 100 - 120 doses to achieve the same amino intake per serving, for $34 (as of 11/06). You pay 7 cents per dose with tabs vs 34 cents with capsules.The tablets are just as absorbant - tableting technology has matched capsule production since 2000-2002."
3,giant pills,"these are not just horse pills. these are freaking elephant pills. i could not swallow a single one without it getting caught in my throat. even if i cut them in half, they are still too big. i ended up grinding them down to a fine powder and mixing them in my protein shakes."
5,Excellent Taste,I've taken many protein supplements. This one is the only one that does not taste like a protein supplement. It is very good mixed with a little water on ice!
4,it is one giant pill.. why not 2 smaller ones?,i never choked on the pills and always had water with them. my friend decided too be the 'genius ' and cut them and the sharp edges scratched his throat.. kinda funny so yeah dont do that.
5,Old fashioned family entertainment,"If you are looking for 3 episodes of good TV shows from the 1960's buy this Christmas DVD. If you are familiar with the ""Hillbillies"" and ""Junction"", you'll love these Christmas episodes. If you are not familiar with these 2 shows, buy it anyway for good family viewing.My overall comment----- Buy it, you'll like it."
4,Great Tribute To Some Legendary Trumpet Players,"This cd features Clark Terry in a quartet setting doing his thing!......his trumpet and flugelhorn playing exhibit the usual happy and joyful sounds that seem to be unique to his playing plus a couple of scat vocals.The selection of music is what makes this album really unique. ""Sugar Blues"" and ""Ciribiribin"", for example, are not what you usually expect in Clark's repertoire. All of it is done very well and the trumpet players honored (in order)are: Roy Eldridge, Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Harry ""Sweets"" Edison, Fats Navarro, Clyde McCoy, Harry James, and Bunny Berigan.If you like the music of Clark Terry or good trumpet in a quartet setting, you'll enjoy this cd!"
5,Thank You!,"this is the first godzilla movie ive ever seen along with one of my friends. this has ultimantly puulled me into the godzilla series. so heres the story. my friends favorite movie store was closing and they were selling everything 95% of to free (last year before school, when we were going to 6th grade in the fall). he had a choice of son of godzilla, barney, tellietubies, the international, scream, whiney the pooh, and so on. he chose son of godzilla. after watching this he promoted it to our friends and then we come to my part of the story.After 3 weeks i finally watched son of godzilla on youtube. i wasnt impressed but that changed my life. sonn i bought final wars and godzilla unleashed. that sucked me in. then i bought vs king ghidorah and battle for the earth 2 in 1 disk thing. ive been watching every movie online untill i get enough money to buy them."
2,A So-So Movie,"This movie was so-so to me. Minya looked stupid as his son, but I did like the fight between Godzilla and the spider. Other than that, it was another childish movie."
3,godzilla turns cuddly,"I remember a week where they played this every afternoon on UHF. In grade 7, my best friend and I watched it every single time while we hung out, laughing and talking. It was truly great fun, my first true experience of camp culture. This is so unbearably crude and ridiculous that it is no wonder the rubber-suited Godzilla has become a kind of icon. So I found this in a yard sale and got it. Unfortunately, my kids - raised on the latest Godzilla and more interested in interactive video - refused to sit through it, though we did have some nice laughs.Recommended for geezer nostalgia. Maybe I can invite my old pal, who is now famous, to see it with me!"
1,Ecology and Models?,"There just might be hope for the planet, as ""living an eco-friendly lifestyle has at last become hip."" So says former Deputy Editor of Elle Decoration, Rebecca Tanqueray, the author of this book. But after reading Eco Chic, I am a bit skeptical. If the future of the planet is reduced to a ""trendy option"" or ""the latest word in style,"" we - and all the other species on this planet - are in a lot of trouble. If you are serious about embracing green causes (permaculture, organic farming, natural building, green technology, etc.) there are many, many, many other books that address these issues in DEPTH, without all the glossy cataloguesque photos and Martha Stewart prose (see my reviews for more info). With this book, Tanquery has achieved what was hitherto unimaginable: She put ecology on the catwalk.Bad ecology for all the wrong reasons.j.w.k."
2,"okay, I guess","My partner and I love this CD but it seems to make Precious, our siamese, uneasy. I recommend it for those times when the kitty's away and the people want to play."
2,hummingbird weathervane,"I have had mine attached to the roof for less than two months. The bearing is already starting to seize. I live in San Diego, we havent had any rain at all. I think the manufacturer shpuld provide a better quality bearing.Tim"
3,Not right for me,"Well constructed, well padded and good looking.Too big and bulky or me. It holds my tripod, ball-head, monopod and table-top tripod with length to spare. I use it to store my gear in the car but I would not bring it into the field.The strap adjusts too easily... it slips."
4,plastics metals magna,This book is a good basic book on plastic moldingbut has nothing about the use of magna plastics and polymer filmsin casting or injection molding.
3,love the CD,"I have a cassette of this same cd that's starting to warp...I love the music so much!! I know that it's rare to find, but I think that it's set at a price a little too high...I can see $20, or even $25."
5,Good record for meditation,"I love this record. It sedates you, then it forces you to wake up scared, then gets creepy. The contrast is so strong that you feel recharged."
5,fugitive 2-2,"Tosee it all again, great trans action, great movie, to find out what happened alll those years ago. It was great."
2,The Fugitive: Season Two v.2,"The Fugitive,s sound track has been changed through out the entier episodes why on earth did paramount cbs change the entier music score? not 2 mention some editing of scenes. keeping somthing to its original format and the magnetic sound strip restoring these old shows they tend to change everything that ruines and spoils .all they needed 2 do is just restor the picture and not touch or change the music score peter rugoles beautiful music score replaced . shame on you paramount cbs"
1,Avoid,"On Amazon, one can find several five-star ""reviews"" of products that haven't been released yet. These reviews are almost always worthless wastes of bandwidth, as evidenced by the many positive pre-release shills for The Fugitive Season 2, Volume 2. Mr. Dahl has captured the essence of this DVD set in his ammended, one star, review titled ""Mutilated"". CBS/Paramount has continues to display a stunning level of amaturishness with regard to their DVD releases. Removing music that they own, removing Public Domain music that they could've kept in for FREE, substituting blaring horns/synths for period cues that weren't an issue with season one, yep, that's REALLY ""(P)utting classic TV on a pedestal"". CBS/Paramount is not likely to offer replacement discs for this set, so, buyer beware."
2,Still Original Music Replaced,"I just don't understand why CBS/Paramount replaces the original music in the DVD version of The Fugitive. For those fans that grew up with the series it is a huge distraction and disappointment. If CBS/Paramount own this series they also own the music. This series only had 2 musical themes, the one by the original composer Paul Ruggio and music from The Twilight Zone. I have both series of The Invaders, another Quin Martin production, they didn't change the music on those episodes. I am really upset.... changes the whole mood of the series."
1,Doesn't look good,"Since they haven't re-released Season 2 Vol. 2 the way it should have been done I very much doubt they will have properly restored the original music for this one. The cover looks good, and the picture quality will look lovely, but replacing the original music with this fake synthesizer rubbish is an absolute disgrace. Please do not buy this as Paramount have completely ruined this great show, which is now unwatchable."
4,Grows on you,"When I first got this CD I thought it was just puffery and couldn't get into it. Today it clicked for me and I haven't stopped listening to it, though I can't quite say why. This group needs to watch their step... they're dangerously close to having their music overwhelmed by that chic, hip and... empty ooze that sticks to many irksome indie bands when they get attention. I guess it's about not being too clever for their own good, staying humble enough to take risks and especially not pursuing polish for its own sake or, worse, cultivating an absence of polish for its own sake. Get it?"
2,Doesn't Cut it For Us,"I ordered these for Mrs. Spudman to use for trimming the feet and ears or our shih tzu and our bolognese puppy.Unfortunately she found the pair we received too dull to be useful. In fact, she compared the new pair to a very similarly designed pair bought a year ago at CVS. The older pair is sharper and cost about the same as the pair ordered on Amazon.We do like the blunt safety tips of the Tiny Dog Grooming scissors, a desirable feature for scissors used to trim a squirming puppy. The scissors also fit the fingers comfortably and open and close smoothly.My take on the range of ratings given for these scissors is that the blade sharpness and quality control at the factory are inconsistent. The Tiny Dog Scissors do seem to work a bit better after a few swipes with my blade sharpener.Shipping was quick for this item, and it was packaged well."
1,Blunt as can be,"I bought three pairs of Millers Forge scissors. Three different kinds. Small, curved, and thinning. They are all blunt and simply do not cut at all. Since I didn't buy them from Amazon, returning them will be a real nuisance. I replaced them with Geib scissors, and there is simply no comparison. Perfect cutting action, smooth, and sharp. P.S. I have no affiliation with Geib. That was just the brand I tried next, and I'm really pleased with them."
2,"Ugly, and difficult to program compared to a Logitech Harmony remote","This remote is pretty powerful for its price range. However, I have to laugh at the guy that said he only spent a few hours programming it. I spent about 15 minutes programming my Harmony Remote. With this remote, you have to type in codes on multiple remotes to program it. With the Harmony remotes, you simply answer questions like ""What kind of DVD player do you have?"" and ""What kind of television do you have?"" and then it programs all the buttons automatically. It really is pretty amazing. And, the Harmony remote actually looks good, whereas this Sony remote is one of the ugliest ones I've ever seen."
5,All in one place,"Because I am writing a novel about the Roman Army I was looking for a source that brings my research together. Having read several of Goldworthy's works I knew this book would be well researched and very readable. I was not disappointed. The graphics are great, drawings, paintings, maps, diagrams and photos really bring support the text and answer a lot of questions that even a professional researcher may have.The complete Roman Army is just that. Although it will not stand alone, it is the one work I have in my library that answers the lions share of my questions. Since buying my first copy nearly two years ago, I have begun sending it as a gift item to other enthusiasts, even one to my editor. This book is a good investment."
3,Every Frame A Rembrant,"If you want to read a book about Andrew Laszlo then this is the book for you. The book takes you through projects he personally encountered and has little in the way of practical advise/techniques for the individual film maker developing their own projects. The book is easy to read and entertaining,although i was looking for a text book style read."
5,coolness,"how many authors do you know that can pull off unicorns, magic, mayham, and so may planets and rings it'll make your head spin? I can't wait to see pixel and renald on earth. Hurry up #5!"
1,Pat Loud sounds off,"This book, written in 1974 with co-author, Nora Johnson, appears to be Pat Loud's response to all of the criticism heaped on the Loud family shortly after PBS's ""An American Family"" exploded on the '70's scene. Uninterrupted (unlike in interviews at the time), Pat expounds on why they chose to do the documentary, when they knew they'd been sucked into something much bigger than they'd anticipated and what became of Pat once she became a household name.The writing is tedious and meandering - Pat had a lot to get off her chest and it shows. It's basically a time capsule that would have been more suited as an entry in a private diary or on a therapist's scratch pad."
5,great game,My nephew (age 7) loves this game so much this is the second time it was purchased. Lots of fun and easy for him to follow.
3,Mixed review.,"This began as the best of the CSI books I've read so far through the first two acts. Intriguing scenarios with a common yet wholly unrelated theme that you'd never expect from a desert-based series. I'm a fan of the show and the author, but, this book left me frustrated and unsatisfied. Until the last two chapters, is was a great read. I expected more -- or differently, I should say -- so perhaps the fault is with me, the reader. Of course, I'm not deterred from reading more of these novels."
2,Reads more like a script than a novel,"I found the writer's ability to convert a tv show into a novel severely lacking. There were parts of the book that seemed more like a script than a book (Catherine says, ""blah blah"", then to Nick says, ""blah blah""), and I had to wonder if the author actually knew how to be descriptive and build an atmosphere. Very disappointing."
4,Would be 5 out of 5 but . . .,"Great story, although the writing is a little bit choppy and the character developement somewhat flat. Where this book really fails is the inordinate use of stereotypes and glib commentary. For instance, I know many Americans wrongly believe Canada is a frozen hinterland where the people ride dog sleds and end every sentence with ""eh?"". While I loved the intelligence displayed in the character of the Mounty from Saskatchewan, and it is true that we have winter in Canada (although Minnesota gets it worse and they are the equivalent of two states lower than where I live), I simply could not excuse the inappropriate use of the word eh. Far too many sentences ended with eh. Most Canadians don't even say eh, let alone those who are highly educated such as a forensic scientist must be. The myth of the Canadian accent is dead. Sure, amazon.com, edit my post, why don't you? I bet those people who didn't find my review helpful are american too."
5,A Delightful Cast of Characters,"I absolutely loved this book! The story is told through the eyes of a number of delightfully quirky citizens of Limoges, Louisiana. I don't usually care for stories that are told from many points of view, but in this case, I became totally immersed in the lives of the folks in Limoges and loved every minute of it. There is plenty of humor along with plenty of heartbreak, but the overall feeling is upbeat. The strength of the story lies with the characters, who come to life on the pages, so real and human in their struggles."
3,A good read but somewhat disappointing,"I enjoyed this book and finished it in a weekend. It held my attention and I liked the way the story was told through the voices of different characters. I was disappointed with the lack of courage and moral character of many of the characters. Come on,if the preacher raped a 12 year old ( her dad had to ""sew her vagina up"") and contributed to the suicidal death of another teenager he had impregnated, I think he would deserve a stronger consequence than being tarred and feathered. He just moved on to another town to victimize other innocent children. Also, why didn't someone just shoot Sophie's husband? I could go on and on. I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I found some of the choices the characters made unrealistic. None of them had a backbone.Most southern women are stronger than this book portrayed."
3,Good but....,"I am always reading books hoping to find the perfect discussion book for my bookclub. This book could have been a wonderful discussion book, but I am not comfortable recommending a book with as much explicit sexual content as this one had. I found myself shaking my head in disbelief that Ms. West felt that the sexual content would add anything benefical to this book."
2,Very disappointing,"I was extremely disappointed. Amazon has been recommending this book, and now I know why I kept putting it off. The only reason I finished it was to find out what happened to Olive Nepper. Not worth the effort."
5,Great Disc,"Our dogs love them. Yes they can be destroyed but they last a long time and hold up far better than any other frisbee we have tried. Both our 100lb + dogs play tug and they hold up. We are get weeks/months out each one, other discs last us a week at best more likely 3 or 4 days. We throw for our dogs every day."
2,not the best but other zogoflex's work,I bought a bunch of zogoflex because my dog destroys everything. This particular Zisc was destroyed in seconds but zogflex makes other shapes that have lasted. I had no luck with the zisc though.
5,Most durable dog disc,"My dog Copper loves to chase and catch this disc. It is made of recycled rubber, lasting almost a whole year to his constant chewing. Then, send it back to the company to be turned into another toy. Definitely, Copper's favorite toy."
3,it is tough!!,This doesn't fly quite as well as the cloth discs and is a little more difficult for our dog to catch...i think because it is a little more bulky that a regular disc. it is tough and is holding up well.
2,Not impressed.,"This was a great toy, for the first 10 minutes. I thought it would be sturdy enough rubber to hold up for more than a few tosses, but my dog folded it once in her mouth, dropped it to the ground, and got 2 good chews in while I ran to take it away, and that was the end of that. The rubber is super soft, and while it throws well and is a great frisbee, I want a DOG TOY. That means it has to survive more than 30 seconds in my dog's mouth."
2,Cannot use it on flat surfaces,"I have a deck, flooring, smooth pathways. My cocker cannot pick it up when on the flat surfaces.Best for grassy bigger dog play."
2,Tennis ball inside???,I was dissappointed in the product. He had flattened whatever is in the inside in about 10 minutes. When it was flattened it sure didn't feel like a tennis ball had been in the toy at all. It felt more liike sand. I'm sure a tennis ball would have lasted much longer.
3,SHADOW THE HEDGHOG THIS GAME WAS KIND OF DISSAPOINTMENT,"THE STORY LINE, I AM TIRED HEARING ABOUT MARIA AND JDR. GERROLD THE GRAPHICS WERE OK WHY WAS SHADOW CURSING THEY TRIED TO MAKE HIM LOOK TOUGH BUT DID NOT WORK FOR ME. AND THE GUN I GUSESS TRYED TO THINK OF SOME THIGINNG NEW BUT DID WORK FOR ME NEITHER. WILL WHATEVER.JJ"
4,A thoughtful and lively story,"I enjoyed reading Hammad's book because her voice was so authentic. I think her story would be particularly valuable to immigrants and the children of immigrants because many of the issues she faced are common to people in similar situations. While I've decided to use this book in a college composition class next semester, I did hesitate somewhat because of the very ""spoken"" (read ""ungrammatical"") language of the text, but I think her messages outweigh any language concerns. I also strongly believe that the Palestinians' story is one that needs to be shared, and Hammad does a nice job of introducing it in a personal way. A couple of things I did find annoying, though, were the unending references to those ""drops"" and also a couple typos within the text that should have been caught by an editor before going to print. All in all, though, it's a quick and enjoyable read that encourages thought."
4,Creative and refreshing,"I have four younger brothers who are always asking me for creative dates that don't cost much. After coming up with maybe three or four ideas, I found it hard to make suggestions that would help them out. I was suprised how many good ideas for creative dates this book had. It was a gem of a find in the bookstore. My first thought was how much I wished I had a book like this when I was still single. However, after reading several of the entries, I found it a great resource for fun and creative activities with my wife without blowing a ton of cash."
4,Great idea book!,"This book is chock full of terrific ideas for those who want to do some creative dating. The suggestions from the book that I have tried are fun and imaginative. Anyone planning a date or groups wanting to plan a party will have fun using the great, yet inexpensive ideas in this book."
1,The perfect book... if your interested in dating 2nd graders,"This is perhaps the biggest waste of paper I have ever purchased. It's aimed towards teens and adults, but it has ""dating activities"" that are mostly remenicient of childhood group games, such as ""Duck, duck, goose!""I highly reccommend not purchasing this, unless you want to find silly games to play with a bunch of kids. It states the purpose of dating is ""getting to know your partner better"", but completely ignores any concept of romance. In the ""group dating activities"", it's games have you doing mostly silly things that don't encourage talking, or getting closer to the person.Please, do yourself a favor and do not buy this hideous piece of crusty rodent droppings. 1 star is too high a rating, but it is the minimum Amazon allows."
4,Nice Looking Asian Doll designed by Corolle :).,"I am living in Korea, South. and I wanted to find out good-looking Asian doll for my 14 month-old baby girl.I wasn't able to find the product in here:(. Every doll sells in here Western looking doll. So I googled the ""Asian Doll"".And I found Yang~! Finally. Once I saw this picture of doll, and I knew that this is The Doll For my baby.I will post the photos of my dag and yang soon after Christmas. This is my first Christmas Gift for her.By the way, I wasn't so pleased the price was $28 when I purchased it but now dropped to $22 something. :(.So I drop one star for overall. But sure you will like it too. :). and I also like the short hari style. Same with my baby.oh, I almost forgot to tell you the eyes are not opening and closing. they stay open, like other reviews. Amazon need to change its description. But sure she has beautiful deep dark eyes.:)Happy Happy holidays~~ for everyone who read this. :)"
2,Much smaller than I expected,This doll is much smaller than I expected - was not what I was looking for. Ended up returning it.
4,Great extra's....but,"...the package is extremely lacking. It is very cheap when compared to other ""Deluxe Editions"" I have purchased, This is very cheap, flimsy cardboard. Other than that the content is fantastic with a boat load of extras that are nice to have all on the second disc. Enjoy - Dio rules !!!"
5,Rocking Dio CD,Dio's first solo release after leaving black sabbath. Proves he can carry his own. This is another must-have for all Dio fans. I've had the tape for atleast 10+ years and still never tire of listening to it.
3,"good, not great.","The other tracks doesn't stand the test of time the way the title track and rnbw in the drk do. Nowhere near as good as the stuff he did with Black Sabbath, which was the best of his career."
3,It was an O.K. book.,"Compared to most of the other Star Wars books it was O.K., but other than that it was pretty good."
5,Great!,"I don't see why Jacen and Jaina can stand the company of Ta'a Chume, who tried to assassinate their mother (Courtship of Leia)"
3,Good Lyrics But Just Average Voice,His voice sounds better when he hits the higher notes but sounds really bland at times. The last 4 songs (including the hiddden track) sound better.
5,A favorite of mine and his.,"This movie was a favorite of mine and my mother's when I was a little girl. At around 16 I was fortunate enough to meet Mr. Robards at the stage door of his production of Twelve Angry Men in NYC. I told him I admired his work and he asked what my favorite was.I answered, ""The House Without a Christmas Tree.""His eyes looked wistful and he smiled. He leaned over and said, ""Mine too.""It's a memory I will always treasure, along with cuddling up with my mom to watch this wonderful movie. I'm thrilled to finally be able to share this story with my own children and also plan on giving it as a gift to my mom this year."
2,Bayla,"I was disappointed when I watched these dvds. I purchased both of Neon's volume 1 and volume 2, and I am returning both. I am sure I could learn something from them, but the flavor and the spirit is not what I was looking for at all. I find her approach interesting, but I am going elsewhere.I was expecting more of a traditional type of instruction. Neon seems very talented, and is quite easy to understand, but this was not what I wanted. I am sure she is an accomplished dancer, but I wanted authentic music, and more traditional instruction for someone interested in belly dancing for belly dancing, not for clubbing, not just a surface approach.I have to say that the spacy techno music is HORRIBLE!!. How she chose that as accompaniment is beyond me. I love middle eastern music, and that was a real let down.I have to move on to something more to my taste. Sorry Neon."
2,waste of money,"i purchased this dvd along with the volume 1 dvd, and it was a waste of my time and money. not only were most of the moves hard to follow, they were too oriented to the club scene and not bellydance, not to mention neon is a very scary looking lady! the movement diagramming that sounds so helpful in other reviews was actually kind of confusing. if you are first starting out and have never seen belly dancing before, this dvd set might be acceptable, but a better use of your money is to enroll in some lessons in your hometown if you can (they have helped me tremendously!) or to try ANYTHING by Veena and Neena--they are much easier on the eye than neon is AND they teach you basic moves and even basic choreography."
5,"Crunchy, Hearty, DELICIOUS!!","My Orthodox sister in law introduced us to these, and we've never looked back! Love them on all kinds of soups, and the kids like to snack on them.Great taste and very filling without the mess of crumbling crackers!!They are a staple with my Chicken Matzoh Ball soup which I make a few times per month. They go fast in this family!!"
1,"Loud, Obnoxious, Poorly Written, Terrible Acting, Sick Plot","I read the reviews on this film and they sold me - big mistake. The script was awful, poorly delivered by mediocre actors who mostly screeched at each other. The music was not much better. Nothing memorable unless you like that horrifying ""lullabye"" at the end with a woman's floating head surrounded in black that fades to the city shaped like her head. Nightmare. Hubby had a hard time believing me when I said it had rave reviews. I should have known better - Dick Powell. Awful.I feel dumber for having watched it."
4,seductive & decadent & fascist & fun,"the first busby berkeley movie that actually bore the imprimatur ""directed by busby berkeley"", the film is none too interesting save for the big production numbers. but what else do you judge a berkeley movie by? the bevy of pianos, all coming together as one as if a gigantic jigsaw puzzle is awesome, but of course its merely a warmup for the REAL reason to see this movie: the 15-minute-long mini-film ""lullaby of broadway"": a mix of the surreal and expressionism set against an art deco world culminating in the heroines death at the hands of a fawning mob. truth be told, im never able to remember which production number belongs in which berkeley movie, but they are always worth your time."
4,Good headset,"Useful headset with unusual system for holding it in your ear. I haven't used it for more than about 20 minutes, but it never felt uncomfortable. It's useful because it winds up easily and does not take up much room, so I use it for Skype while traveling. The mic boom is short, but has no problem picking up your voice."
3,Sort of....,"This book was your typical young adult girl's book, I thought. The kind of writing was okay, the character was sterotypical, and it seemed kind of cheesy.But overal, it wasn't too bad."
4,Better than JESUS!,"I have to just start off by saying, I loved this film! ...it was very well put together and it spoke from the *cough*...heart...the only problem I had was all the swearing, horrific violence, and frontal nudity...children should NOT be exposed to this programming, ever!"
3,Good wheel,"It's a good wheel.But it has a lot of Dead Zone in it.Nascar 2003 Season is the worst dead zone.You can tweak it out so it dosent have as much.But for Dirt Track Racing, Rally sport challenge and other off road or on road games it is a great wheel but it dose crunch some times. sounds like somthing in it. ever since I bought it it has done that but works.The look is awesome better then the picture.but I cant complain I bought it from theese guys for 60.00 on sale.and Any where else it would be 110.00 $"
3,Needs firmware update to work with the DJ 450,"This product will not work out of the package with the DJ 450. You must update the printer firmware in order to get the printer to recognize the card. Since the printer was out of warranty I had to purchase a service contract from HP in order to find out what the problem could be and to get the firmware update. After the firmware is updated the printer will work fine after the printer software is installed on your computer. You can use the USB cable and save yourself some time, trouble and money."
2,Not up to academic standards but ok for a basic reference,"There is no bibliography or footnotes or any citations at all in this book and that is always a bad sign. Sure the pictures are cool to look at, there are ok timelines and tables, and just having an alphabetical source of Egyptian terms is wonderful. But this should not be somone's primary source for Egyptian information especially if you are doing anything academically like writing a school paper or giving a talk on Egypt. I'll tell you this for certain, it is not worth [the money]..."
2,Disappointed,This was supposed to be a reference book. I found it only to be a book with a collection of pictures and prices. It would have been an excellent book if the author would have identified the lamps.
4,Bean Machine,"This is a fun way to put out your jelly beans. WARNING!!! If you have a house full of kids or friends and family, you'll have a great deal of trouble keeping jelly beans in the dispenser. :-) This unit was relatively easy to configure so coins weren't required. Some of the ""workings"" seem a bit flimsy, plastic and such, but the body is cast metal and works fine. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase."
4,Much betteer than I expected,The kids wanted me to get this on a trip to the US. I was expecting it to be made of cheap plastic. It is actually metal with a glass bowl. The kids love it and it also means we can control their consumption of Jelly Bellies.Charles (from the UK)
3,Very Raw But Still Good,This album is great but only a Madonna fan will like it. The versions are much better on the Immaculate Collection. Still likable and a great start to the career of the ultimate superstar.
5,Electronic Curling Iron,I found this product to be exactly as described and exactly what I was looking for. The item was shipped within a few days after I ordered it.
1,NO MORE,"I read up to page 94. What a horrible book! The conversation is stumbling and non-sensical. The Newlie characters consistently make little sense, speaking in disjointed dialects and phrases. The plot is watery and predictable. My girlfriend, watching me read this ""thing"" would frequently ask me why I was still reading it. I don't like to put books down, but this just wasn't worth my time.Writing in the fantasy genre isn't an excuse to do so poorly. Don't buy this by accident. It is an insult to a growing and respectable body of literature."
1,misguided,"Despite repeated effort and vigilant prayer I could not even get through the first chapter .... now I have insight as to why... I have had the misfortune of having the acquaintance of Mr. Stiner for several years; during that time he has revealed himself to be a liar, a thief, a predator; a disgrace to the Christian faith. His ""ministry"" has damaged many Christians and shamed the Christian community. Please pray for him but Please DO NOT support his works."
4,Work well but...,"The water pressure that is exerted from that water plume in the picture can cause the rubber flapper to unseat so that it doesn't seal properly. One has to compact the water dispenser tube and rotate it away from the flapper to minimize it's affect on the flapper. It took us a couple months to figure out what was happening inside the tank when the toilet wasn't flushing with full force. If you know this, you can make the proper adjustments."
1,"Starts out good, WORTHLESS in the end",I've had this valve for 11 months now and at about month 7 it started giving me issues. The slider piece gets jammed up doesn't start refilling the tank after you flush like it should. Instead you have to jiggle the handle a couple times to get the slider to fall down to trigger the refill. It's annoying to say the least and has gotten to the point where I'm looking for a new valve already. BUYER BEWARE!
2,disapointment,"I purchased the Hydroclean 660 water saving fill valve with cleaning tube through Amazon. Once the toliet is flushed, it takes FOREVER for the tank to fill. The water cleaning device doesn't do anything. Save your money, don't purchase this!"
4,Fill Valve,"Doesn't appear much different from other similar designs for fill valves. Easy to install and directions were generally clear. It seems to work well. I don't know if the cleaning tube attachment is truly effective or just a ""gee whiz"" feature to attract plumbing naifs. The instructions do recommend replacing the supply line from the wall to the tank, but that's not indicated anywhere on the outside of the box. Finally there is a lock used to help diagnose leaky flappers and during installation. The plastic clip has slid into the locked position a couple of times during use, preventing the tank from filling. Not much of a problem; just lift the tank cover move the clip and you're back in business."
1,Failed after 6 months,"The valve got clogged up after 6 months, and water flows out to a trickle so it takes forever to fill the tank. No easy way to fix. My standard fill valve lasted 10 years!"
5,A Great and Twisting Odyssey,"I love the Victorian era and this book provides a wonderful glimpse into its underside. The intricate plot keeps both readers and main characters discovering and learning.Highly Recommended.James Conroyd Martin, Author of PUSH NOT THE RIVERPush Not the River"
4,A delightful Shirley Temple Film!,"Shirley Temple is pint-sized in this film and is fun to watch as she sings some of her number one theme songs ""Animal Crakers in my Soup"" and ""When I Grow Up."" Shirley plays Elizabeth, an orphan living at an orphange that her sister Mary works at. Shirley charms one of the trustees and he imediately falls in love with her spunk. The movie has some entertaining moments that strike us all. I always laugh when Elizabeth is trying to adjust to her new rich and spoiled life. All though Shirley seems to be sweet and innocent through the whole movie, she has a selfish point where she says she rather have a pair of roller skates when her gaurdian gives her a pearl necklace. She saves that little rude comment by putting on a benefit for her orphan friends. The story line at times is hard to follow, but as always ends happily. Curly Top is a wonderful movie for young children, but doesn't have a moral or a point. Shirley of course will dazzle you!"
2,Nothing special,"Bought it on basis of reviews.I will just use it as I have it now. But will not buy a new one.No, nothing wrong with it.But did not find anything special about it either. Will try another after shave balm later, after this one is used up."
5,GREAT,great product! arrived on time...very prestine...highly recommended...price is not too expensive for a legitamite aftershave...
3,Good if you have time,I've only been able to use this whole video a few times. I mostly did the ab work out- about 2 weeks. I did not SEE any real results but the underlying muscle strength and tone returned. If you have a babsitter I would get this. My husband is a full time student so even 10 minutes is hard to find!
5,Ewww lala! Fantastic!,"I've been playing with a cheap Yamaha recorder for a while because I didn't really think the instrument made much difference; I thought the quality of the sound only had to do with the skill of the musician. When my husband and I ordered these, I decided to play his for a while because I just knew I'd want to return mine and save the money. After playing his for 5 minutes I knew these were keepers! These have a nice mellow sound, and unlike wooden recorders, you don't have to break them in gradually. I love the sound. It is taking me a little adjusting to the English fingering, but no big deal, it'll come. The recorder came with a zippered sturdy cloth carrying case, not draw string like the less expensive recorders. Well worth the price!"
3,Same problems as everyone else,"The product came as ordered but 3 of the cans had popper their tops. My box didn't have a plastic liner so there was no hope of saving the spilled product. The shipping cost was outrageous so don't think you're getting a deal. However, as one reviewer said, it's better than no decent paprika at all."
3,Impossible to get clean,"After being used with anything but water, the bottles are almost impossible to get clean. Even with using a bottle brush (a regular one from Gerber, the Avent curved bottle brush, the soap dispensing one from Sassy), I still have to let the bottles soak in warm soapy water to get them clean. I've tried putting them in the dishwasher, but it doesn't seem to get the bottom clean.However, I do like that these bottles are easy for little ones to hold all by themselves!Maybe they could make and improvement and have the unscrewable bottles like the Playtex VentAire bottles. That would make cleaning SO much easier."
4,Love these bottles,"I love these bottles. I was able to buy them in the store when my now 4-year-old was a baby. I bought them online for my new infant son because I could not find them anywhere. I notice though that they leak when you use the nipples they come with, but if you change the nipples to Evenflo, there are no problems. These bottles were great for my daughter when she was first learning to hold her own bottle and I couldn't wait to get them for my son."
1,I feel mislead,This product is only for 4 pieces of one side of the velcro. It's not very useful unless you have things already with the hook velcro part attached.
1,why am i still reading these?,"God knows why I'm still reading these stupid books they're terrible. but anyways, I just have to say that this is probably the worst book yet in the series and don't make the same mistake I did by wasting your money on it."
2,Just a Table of Contents,"This book is basically a huge overview of a snapshot in time of what's going on in neural research with math emphasis. I give it 2/5 stars because that's the depth of the knowledge provided within this ""textbook"". It dedicates just a few pages per topic that could easily require a whole textbook to really obtain knowledge from.It's outdated in the sense that this field is expanding at an exponential rate, so the topics highlighted in this book are by no means cutting-edge information. Although a newcomer to the field may benefit.A plus to this book is that there is a plethora of research articles it recommends to read per topic to see how the topics have been applied. Unfortunately, it doesn't give a list of good neural engineering textbooks per topic. If you are looking for an overview book, get this. If you're looking to have a rigorous understanding to be able to apply neural engineering concepts, look elsewhere."
2,Okay,"This video is Ok. I guess I was expecting that it would be like the book, and was really disapointed.Other than than, it was ok. Some parts were really funny(you gotta eat your spinich, baby...!)It had a really suprising ending.Also, I did not see much point in dressing up in a solger suit and dancing up and down the stairs. How boring!Now that I've finished my complants, good bye!"
3,Rebecca,"Although the filmitself was fine,it was absolutely NOTHING like the novel it was designed after. I was dissapointed by this.. However, not the sellers fault."
4,Useful ... written by a consultant ...,"This book does provide a valuable summary of others works in branding. Helps to explain and clarify how many different items have a link to your brand and shape the percpetion of it in customers minds. Not a new thought, but again a good succint summary that reminded me to think through how such relationships add value or take away from the organization and brands I work for. What this book does add is a way to depcit these relationships on a 3 dimensional model. Interesting ... but I would question the value of the time and effort spent to create such a diagram. I don't think the authors would disagree with me when I say it is the thought process that makes the difference .. not the fancy depiction."
1,Don't Be Fooled,"This item SAYS that it is on sale, however just two days ago the average price for this item was $89.99.Whoever is selling it jacked the price up over $100, and then discounted it 50%, making you believe that you were saving! You are not, don't waste your money on such foolish businessmen/women."
2,Kindle issues,"This is not a review of Mary Oliver's work, which is spectacular. I am writing about how this appeared in my Kindle. Some of the pieces appear in extremely small print and I cannot adjust it with the font feature. I have had this problem in almost every other book of poetry by Mary Oliver that I have tried. I suggest that you try a sample before purchasing a book by this author. Maybe it is not a universal problem, but you might like to check the fonts before you buy."
2,"Poetry is good, formatting almost unreadable","The poetry of Mary Oliver is beyond reproach if you like nature poetry(birds, snakes, deer, and shelled creatures). I found the poems in this book a little redundant but still well written and a few even thought provoking. The major problem, and the reason I would not recommend that you buy this edition, is the kindle formatting. The typeface goes from super small to comically large at random. The is no way to adjust it so that it is uniform. I realize that e books are not perfect but this one is almost unreadable. At times, the typeface is as tiny as it can be on a kindle and the tool to enlarge it has no effect. Anyone with even a slight visual impairment would not be able to read this print. I will be asking Amazon for a refund."
2,"buggy, and no customer support","While I think it has great potential, it seems to have a few bugs that potentially stop it from being useable. I gave this as a gift, and the owner has had his hard drive crash (including a new one he installed after the first crash). I should note both hard drives crashed after the installation of Poser 5 and the upgrade on their website.I have emailed Curious Labs several times for customer support (as has the gift recipient), but have recieved absolutely NO response. Three weeks is a more than adequate time to wait for a response. There is also no technical support phoneline, which there should be.My main problem with this company is not the product at this point, but the lack of service (or even acknowledgement of customers) on behalf of Curious Labs. I am curious to know if anyone has ever recieved any sort of follow up by this company. I won't be buying any future products from this company."
4,Much More Stable Than Before,"I noticed some earlier reviews about Poser 5 being unstable. I don't know if the current version (Service Pack 3) is any more stable on the systems of those reviewers, but it's been running very well on mine, a PC clone I built myself. That said, it does run very slow if it's loaded down with detailed dynamic hair and the render quality is turned up high, but that's something I don't think is always needed to produce a quality animation. I usually save it for still images.I'm not sure how the latest upgrade has improved on most machines, but it looks like Curious Labs is trying to improve the reliablity of Poser 5. Now if someone can get it to import to Vue d'Esprit 4 I'll be totally happy."
1,too HARD!,"this program is too hard to figure out, the instructions are complicated. NOT for the average person just wanting to play around."
3,Designing with Photos,"This book is definitely for the person who knows about aperture, exposure, etc. NOT for the BEGINNER. The book is made very well. Too pricey for the contents, your really paying for the quality of the book. Not as much information as I had hoped for by reading the excerpts before purchasing. If you know about cameras and you don't mind paying more for what you are getting...go ahead and purchase. I would say I was more disappointed than upset."
3,Lenmar DLC2L Digital Camera battery,"Even though I haven't used it yet, the appearance, the required size and material appear to be excellent.It looks very similar to the batter it's replacing."
2,This Lenmar Product Is For The Birds,"I bought this battery as an auxiliary to carry in my Lowepro bag for when the main battery on my Canon ZR-500 runs down. Sometimes the switch will go from the ""off"" position to ""camera"" which leads to my battery being drained. I bought the Lenmar DLC2L to combat this problem.Well after attaching the Lenmar to my Canon videocamera the battery looked to be the perfect fit until after its attachment and several uses I noticed that the energy of the battery seemed less and less from where it would have been had I been using a Canon model. Indeed, the battery was virtually drained after less than 10-15 minutes' use of the camera. To me this was/is unacceptable.Stay away from this product. At best, it is only a below average secondary battery, at worst is is a wattage-wasting energy loser.A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr."
5,Wonderful Tool For Speakers,"I expected a lot from this book and was still pleasantly surprised. James C. Humes is a very experienced speechwriter and speaker that takes the time to tell you some great secrets of public speaking.The book goes through every aspect of speaking from opening to closing and beyond. Each section has many great ideas to take from it. There was no chapter that I did not walk away from saying, ""That was a great idea!"" When he makes a recommendation, he backs it up with supporting facts and real stories that illustrate the point.The book is also easy to read. The writing style is easy to read and is interesting. Humes seamlessly ties in stories from the great speakers of history to demonstrate his ideas. Many of the stories are humorous, but all are good. Humes is also very clear in his recommendations, which leaves little confusion on the reader's part.I would recommend this to anyone interested in public speaking."
3,speaking like churchill,"This is an excellent book for speakers os any level who wish to make small yet noticeable improvements to their speaking performance. Churchill and Lincoln both mastered the skills necessary to be great speakers. The greatest secret that I took from this book is the power of the ..... PAUSE. To stand in front of a group of people saying nothing , with poise and confidence , is a skill the truly seperates great speakers from the rest.I would recommend this book without hesitation."
3,"A book of Tips, Tricks and Anecdotal Evidence","Let me start out by stating that I enjoyed this book. There are tons of great quotes peppered throughout the text. The reason for the 3 star rating is the lack of data to back up any claims. Every bit of advice is backed by a speech or presentation that demonstrates the effect the author is recommending. There isn't much explanation as to why the advice works. Just a bunch of ""Do this. Do that. See... it worked for Lincoln and Churchill"".To summarize: Not enough reasoning to explain WHY the advice works."
3,Was a great product until...,This was a great changing pad until my son got bigger and more active. As he grew and became stronger this pad tore easily with his little legs kicking around. Next time I'll be getting a pad that just has the two sides to keep him and our future babies from rolling off.
2,Easily tears in months,"I had a changing pad and used it for the first 4 months of my son's life. It developed tears around the straps (I never used them, just tucked them under the cover). The store where it was from took it back and replaced it. The second one has a tear at one end, not near straps or any other wear spot, after only 8 months. The store won't take it back, so I'll be contacting the manufacturer. I wouldn't advise this brand to anyone. We did not mount it on furniture - we just slide it out from under the crib to use it and then slide it back."
2,WARNING ABOUT SIZE,"Received the Century 6210 Portable Toilet today 1/13/2013, pleased with the fast shipping. Box had damage, but everything ok inside. I bought this for our Aliner popup camper, and if the toilet was the size they stated in the listing it would be perfect, BUT, it was 16.5"" high, not 14.5"" high as they stated. Won't fit in the compartment I had planned to store it in, and I can't modify the area for it to fit.... Haven't decided what to do yet. As everyone knows, its a pain to ship stuff back to a seller.UPDATE 1/14/2013:Decided to return Toilet for my above reason."
3,Lee's last recording satisfactory,"Peggy Lee's thimble-sized voice is a mere warble on this recording. But Lee's inimitable style is very present. Listen to her phrasing on ""Folks who Live on the Hill"" and ""S'Wonderful. The selections and musicians, led by Mike Renzi, are first rate."
2,"For Collecting Perhaps, Not for Listening","I really enjoy Peggy Lee, but I would encourage people to buy an earlier CD if they want to hear her at her best. These recordings are among her last and, unfortunately, they sound like it. She mumbles a lot and most of them she sounds barely awake and definitely not on key. In the the rare moments when she is animated, she is hardly recognizable as the Peggy Lee of years earlier. Also, the orchestration is virtually elevator music . Very depressing."
2,"A book for christians, and not very good at that.","If you happen not to be a christian you willbecome quite annoyed at the implication that yourproblem is that your are not doing what ""Jesus"" said you should. Worse, the case histories soundmade up, and probably are. They ascribe inner feelings to people that the writer almost certainly did not know. Try another book first."
5,Funniest comedian ever!,Jim Gaffigan is one of my favorite all time comedians. This is his best work yet. Destined to become a classic. Highly recommend.
5,IT'S SMOKIN!,Damn Nasty Man is smokin on all these tracks. Glad to see Aaron Hall come back into the game and bring the real RnB voice out and not like all those fake ass singers tryna be singers u get me. Aaron Hall has got ONE of the best voices I've heard so far in RnB and I don't think anyone can match his style and uniqueness. PICK THIS UP 2DAY!
2,not a lot there,"The mathematics is phony window dressing. Wood is utterly miscast. The acting in the supporting roles is mediocre. The movie is full of bizarre stuff like a film of Wittgenstein at the front doing philosophy with bullets whizzing around him and a mathematical wierdo who shoots a nail in his head in frenzied self-experimentation. Lusting twenty-something women throwing themselves at Elijah Wood at first sight. Pseudo-philosophical drivel.etc. etc.Well, I sat through it. It wasn't bad enough to cut my losses and go to bed. Must be a 2 star movie."
2,A disappointment,"I had high hopes for this movie. I saw it advertized and was happy to find the pre-theatrical version on-demand. Both predictable and dull at times, I would not waste your money. Any intrigued that could be created ia overly simplified and even the attempts at intellectualism are forced. Either give me something that is thought provoking or full of chases and explosions. What lies in-between is this movie. A great disappointment because of what it could have been."
3,"Mouse is Wonderful, Keyboard Deserves a Second Look","I have had to get a replacement product before. I bought the combination and then, 3 weeks after I installed it, the keyboard went bad with no warning. It wouldn't connect with the base station. I would press the connect button on the base station, and then press the connect button on the keyboard, but the base didn't recognize it, or didn't even get a signal. I contacted Microsoft's E-mail support, and they were of no help. I finally had to call long distance to get any help. I have never had any problems with either of the mice. The second keyboard is great, but the range from the base is much shorter than the mouse. It is kind of disappointing that I can only take the mouse across the room. If you do not want to take the combination very far, than I highly recommend the product. If you want to take it longer than 4 feet away, you may want to look at other products."
2,Major disappointment,"After waiting more than a month for this product to be released, I was very disappointed to find the wireless optical mouse is very slow. You can use the USB port and the enclosed software and tweak it all you want, but it still will never speed across your screen. The keyboard seemed fine, but the two items are a package. I returned the Microsoft product and bought a Logitech Elite Keyboard (yes, it is corded, but who really needs a cordless keyboard?) and an excellent Logitech Cordless Optical mouse, which speeds across the screen as fast as I want. The Logitech mouse also has a slightly higher profile, which I find more comfortable."
5,Most comfortable laptop backpack I've ever owned,"As a recovering RSI patient, I was on the lookout for a backpack that was easy on the back, and also big enough to carry some extra stuff such as a foldable book/ computer stand, an external keyboard (laptop size) etc....this bag swallows them in, and i can hardly feel the extra weight. I am very happy with this purchase.On the other hand, the bag is not too big - it can only accomodate so much - so if you want to carry your entire office with you, i'd suggest the Wenger Synergy or similar backpack (I did try the Synergy, and while it was an excellent bag - bigger, more stylish than the Kensington, I opted for the Kensington because it was more comfortable."
3,big but doesn't seem to fit much,"I expected this to be big, which it is, but it has a weird shape, sticking out at the bottom. Several times I knocked something over or into someone while turning because it sticks out so much. Even so, I expected it to hold more."
5,Dominos,"Great product and fast delivery. New condition and lots of fun. We play this game with neighbors on a regular basis and the numbered dominos make it easy except for the similar colors of the 6 and 9. I wish there was more difference in those. Other than that, it is great"
4,Number Dominoes,"A win-win as a game for those who have trouble with the dots set. I purchased this numbered dominoes set because we enjoy playing Mexican Train. When a 6 1/2 year old family member wanted to play too, the dots took too long for him to count. This set not only worked great for him but also an 87 year old friend was able to finally win because she found it less confusing to play with."
5,very pleased,I bought this for a family member and was very pleased at how quickly they got the product. It was in great condition and they are really enjoying it! I had no problems!
3,"Nice, but colors need some work","Bought these for my Mom's domino group. They like the numbers, however, the colors are too light, and the 6 and 9 are similar colors, so difficult to tell the difference. However, a creative friend in the group took them and painted the lighter colors darker, and the 6 and 9 different colors to make them more distinctive.....so with a little work on colors, these are great. No other complaints, everyone seems to like the quality, weight, etc."
1,Colored dominoes,We can not use the dominoes. The nines and sixes are about the same color. There were other numbers so light that it is difficult to see the numbers from across the table. So these dominoes are useless. I wish that I could have seen the c0oloors before I ordered them.
5,Great,"Great to found this book!!! I was looking for this book a lot.I would find it in spanish, so I'm going to enjoy so muchthanks a lot, Amazon!!!"
4,Intriguing,"This would require some extra work and support from the members of a meeting, but it might be worth the try."
1,Disappointing,I took the Dantes test today.There were 101 questions and this book came close in about 10.What a surprise I experienced.It would have been nice if most of the book material had been close to what was in the test.It was if someone put the book together just guessing what the questions might be.
2,Great keyboard except one huge problem...,"I loved this keyboard except they messed with the layout of the edit keys (insert, delete, home, end, pgup, pgdown)I never look at my keyboard I know where all the keys are and I kept hitting the wrong key on this board because they felt the need to make their ""special"" little layout. I couldn't get past it. They turned an otherwide great product into a smoking pile of junk!"
1,Can't Fight Crime With These!!!,"These are far lighter and less durable than lead to believe. Cannot maim, alarm, or even fly more than 2 feet. Also they are about 3 inches long. How am I suppose to fight crime with these????"
1,"Wow, totally NOT worth the $$","When I received these, I was SHOCKED. They are about 4"" long, and very lightweight foam. They are too small for my 6 year old to grip them to even attempt to throw them. I was disappointed with these batarangs. They are not worth more than two dollars total. They are good for nothing more than a chew toy. I would have much rather had one batarang four times the size than these four useless tiny ones."
4,College Board College Handbook,"We used this book to help my daughter pick the colleges she would apply to. The book is a wealth of information about every 2 and 4 year college in the United States. At a glance you can find out the cost, academic offerings, SAT scores, clubs and organizations and ethnic makeup just to name a few. I highly recommend it to anyone applying to college."
5,I like it,"When I first saw this book, I thought Oh no, another fulffy wiccan new age waste of paper. Not so. Im sorry to see that this book is no longer in print. I really like the feel of it, and while I am not a wiccan, I can see how this book would be beneficial to all sorts of people, whatever their spirituality. The author presents different sections on Catholocism, Buddism, Hinduism, Old Religion, Santeria, and more. While I do agree with the previous reviewer who wrote about Santeria being combined with other faiths, the section on this is a nice overview for those who would like a little information on it. All in all this is a pretty good book, pick up a good used copy and enjoy."
2,Wiccan for sure,"This book is deffinently wiccan. What I mean by that is that the author presents a jumble of traditions and tells the reader to practice with any of the ""deities"" mentioned that they feel comfortable with. This is fine for people who work with architypes and old gods but the author also mentions Orisha. Orisha are NOT gods, they are spirits, they are tangible living spirits which are recieved through initiation into Santeria. Orisha can be worked with without initiation, but you must have a relationship with them, not treat them like just another face or architype of different gods and goddesses. In Santeria there is God/Olodumare and then there are Orisha who are spirits. If someone is wiccan that is fine but dont confuse wiccan gods with Orisha, they are not the same."
4,Heals the body and soul!,"As a typically overworked, overstressed New Yorker (a graduate student and competitive runner) not only injuries but some well-needed introspection brought me to Sarah Shapiro's beautiful meditation tape, ""Chakra Healing."" Doctors had been telling me for years that a regular practice of relaxation might help ameliorate a stress-related stomach disorder I've had since early adulthood. While using the tape has decreased some of my physical symptoms, what I really appreciate about ""Chakra Healing"" is that it is based on centuries-old philosophical and spiritual teachings - it's something I can take seriously! It has become a part of my daily meditation practice."
3,A bit flimsy & so very light...,"I am told by people I call on my sell with this item that the sound quality is very good . The set I got was so feather light that it's hard to keep on my ear - the wing that goes over the ear does NOT stay firmly in any one position either but this item is so inexpensive it's really hard to complain about it & the seller's service is exceptional . It meets it's purpose , although minimally but it does make me ""street legal"" , if you know what I mean ."
3,"..nope, nope!","Vanilla Ice tried so hard to be cool. (Pun unintended.) How come there are no childhood pics of him in here? Youngest they show is 18... all books like this always include at least one pic of the subject as a baby/toddler. This book is full of him bragging... ""hard to get nervous when so many people like you"", ""when I walked in the club, they saw I had movie star quality"". He claimed he never cries and closest he's came was when his record company surprised him with a gold chain and a cake. I bet he's since shed tears since this book was written, though. He has rap examples in this book...omg... Dr. Seuss writes better rhymes! I give this book 3 stars because I like V-Ice. He's my guilty pleasure!"
1,Salty beyond words,"This is a very salty, albeit crispy, product. I wish there were a low salt version because otherwise it's good. It's crunchy and has only a tiny number of unpopped kernels but the saltiness is overwhelming."
1,Wasteof$$,Buyer beware. You'd be better off to Google revenge tips than wasting your money on this childish and hazardous nonsense since it certainly was prepared well before the age of CCTV and other scanning technologies. It also reeks of frat house pranks so the stuff in it is either just plain silly or will incriminate the revenger by going too far under the watchful eye of the CCTV.
5,Beautiful,Georgia's flag is a beautiful representation of the Flag of the state/city of Jerusalem also known as the jerusalem cross. A wonderful addition to my collection
2,Reference,"The first disc is the same as the ""Mad About the Boy"" [2003](mis-labeled 2004) CD.Note the inclusion of the song ""Long John Blues"""
4,Inland Lakes 010-C0458-00,"Delivery was prompt; however, I was overcharged for shipping from the company. I had to request a partial refund. Nice presentation on the chart, however, not all buoys shown - I had to add some."
4,"Hit and miss, but mostly hit","KA is best known as a novelist, but his short fiction, here in ""BTC"" is quite engaging. It's too bad this book is not more widely available. Kafka is a strong influence throughout - somewhat shamelessly at times, but who cares: good writing is good writing. 'Intruders' is the best in the collection, about a strange family that knocks on a man's apartment door in the middle of the night and proceeds to take over his apartment and life, making him into a sort of servant. In the opening story, a man comes home to find a corpse in his bed. His decision making is engaging. A few of the stories are duds, but that's generally the case. Worth the time, if you like KA's novels, and Japanese fiction, especially Murakami, who was clearly influenced by KA."
2,Helpful guide but>>>>,"In and Around London for Kids is a helpful start in finding places that will interest children in London. There were some drawbacks. Some of the information was out of date -- the Toy Museum has closed, the Science Museum no longer has the sports exhibit, may not be a big deal, but when you've convinced an 11 year old to go to the museum after the word sports perks his interest, then find out it's closed, there is evidence of an unhappy child. No pictures - does not encourage a young child to help plan the trip."
5,"Rich, exotic, beautiful music from another place and time","Wonderful CD. Enrico Macias at his best, returning to his Algerian heritage."
2,Disappointing. Not as good as I'd hoped.,"I must be spoiled byCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,Hero,Iron MonkeyandHouse of Flying Daggers. I was expecting something along the same lines (in terms of art direction, costuming, story, etc.). In that regard I was disappointed. It felt unpolished.Was hoping for something a bit more epic or fantastic. The fights were also somewhat unpolished. Granted, I saw some things I hadn't seen before, but it just looked a bit rough / raw in terms of the actual film style and that turned me off from enjoying it. As the Amazon review also said, some of the fights and editing cuts are so frenetic it's hard to tell who's slaughtering who until it's over.In all, unless you're really a fan of the genre and don't mind what I'd call unpolished camera work, you might want to rent this before buying it. It's unfortunate that the box/art exceeds the quality of the movie itself."
3,Description is Wrong,"I bought this and the black one that is described as ""men's"" so I ordered smalls for my two teens. When I got them, they are clearly marked small-12 and under. They are children's sizes! It took three calls and over 1 1/2 hours of my time to get the right ones sent to me. All that would have been prevented if they had the description right in the first place."
1,not so good,"Used on Kindle Paperwhite :Does not display word with definition at the search field. Displays commentary instead. After selecting the letter [ie: a,b,c,..f,g..] to begin, you have to turn pages until you arrive at the word you want. The definition is ok, but hard to get to, I was not looking for a commentary just the definition ."
2,ZZZZZZ,zzzz...forced myself to watch the entire video. It remains in its' case unused. Definetly not what I expected. I am sure there are better formats to purchase.
3,"No es malo, pero le falta inovacion.","Este album no va a ser muy popular, y esto es por que.1.Ismaelito no canta como salseros romanticos, como Victor Manuelle, ni canta a la juventud con una salsa callejera como lo hace Andy Montan~ez en su nueva musica.2. La orquesta no suena ni original, ni especial. Ninguno de los musicos dan una demonstracion unica. No hay unos tumbaos de piano que me inspiran a bailar como los de ""La Verdad"", orquesta de Joe Arroyo, o metales fuertes como los de la orquesta Sonora Carruseles.3. Por lo tanto ni en la radio, ni en la pista se van a escuchar estas canciones. El disco esta bien para una orquesta de una barra, pero no para hijos de artistas tan destacados. Solo van a vender por nomber, y no por calidad."
1,wrong information,This is suppose to be sweet paprika but it is HOT. I runed my Bar-B-Q because I thought this was sweet and used it as I would if it was sweet. the information on the can is misleading.
4,Great!,"I really like this keyboard. After a very bad experience with a Logitech wireless combo, I decided to buy this and it works great! It was easy to set up, its reliable, easy to use, I've never had a problem with it. Never. The only reason that it didn't get 5 stars is because the keyboard keys are angular, so it took a while for me to get used to this keyboard. I'm so glad that I bought it. It was worth the money."
2,"Feels Great, Bad Reception","I am a big fan of the microsoft ""natural"" line of keyboards, so I decided to buy the wireless version.I was really disappointed by the RF reception. At times I would type and the receiver would detect every other letter. I tried placing the receiver at different distances, 4ft, 3ft, 2ft. Other times it would work perfectly.I wouldn't recommend this product."
4,Aikido and the coffee-table,"As an Aikido newcomer, I was delighted to come across Shimizu Kenji's ""The Heavenly Road"".This book uses a minimum of words and a maximum of clear photographs to illustrate the authors intent.Easy on the eye and inner-picture evoking, I not only recommend the book but look forward to my next training session with added enthusiasm.Iain White - Australia"
2,wrong stockpot,"Well I only gave this pot a 2 because I actually didnt get to see the correct one since I was shipped ""Bayou Classic Stainless Steel Stockpot with Vented Lid"" instead of ""Bayou Classic Stainless Steel Stockpot with Boil Baskets"" which you might think is not a huge deal but the one has room to lift the inner basket to allow for steaming and the other does not. So I just wanted to warn others that this might happen again. Also if you look there is a $30 dollar difference. So I ordered the smaller 62qt one and we shall see what happens.."
5,Fun Pot to Use,I love this pot. It works just as I had hoped. It is made of nice heavy stainless steel the the basket is sturdy too. We used it over a camp fire and it functioned perfetly.I would heartily recommend this stockpot.
3,Nice cover up for apartment stoves,"I have always like to put these over an apartment or rental house stove to make a kitchen look neater and cleaner. Helps cover any burned drip pans and rings, puts a messy look out of sight. Keeps crumbs out of drip pans and provides solid surface to set things on. Practical for everyday use if you do not use all burners often. I wish they offered 3 small + 1 large set.Detraction: if you mistakenly turn burner on with a cover on it the cover will be ruined very fast, it will burn black and smoke! Also, the edges always eventually rust from exposure to spills, and cleaning up. Wish they were made of something that would not rust. Keep them dry."
1,issue on disc 1,The series is great the box set is great but surprisingly disc 1 didnt work.I think ill just buy the volume one you think those will be same episodes?nothing against amazon though they usually are amazing with there services.
3,"Compared with Photoshop Type Magic 2,this one is not useful",What I learn from this book is very little. You can only learn 2 to 3 methods to make your web photos more beautiful. This book is not suitable for expert user.
3,Sorry to be a spoil sport,"Well, I ordered this book on the recommendation of everyone else who wrote reviews for it thinking it must be worth the price since everyone gave it 5 stars. Perhaps my expectations were too high then. I found the photographs in this book to be a bit amateurish. I find homoerotic photography appealing when the subjects show the essence of male attractiveness -- beauty, confidence, contentment and power. The only one of those that comes through in these photographs is beauty, and then only if you are into VERY young guys (think ""Freshman"" magazine)-- I'd guess average age is 18. The way the photographer has posed his subjects makes them reek of imaturity. Most look either uncomfortable before the camera or goofy. True, they've all got great bodies, but I prefer more mature subjects and more artfully composed compositions. A nice try, but there are many better than this."
2,Boring,I watched this with my daughter and she got bored with it pretty quickly. Maybe good for a horse lover but that's about it.
1,Awful!!,"Aside from the scenery, this has got to be one of the worst movies ever made. The acting is terrible and the cinematography is incredibly amateur. My 10 & 12 year old daughters were bored with it in the first 20 minutes. We suffered through it hoping it would get better but no such luck. Don't even bother renting this one, much less buying it."
4,Nice looking clock,"Recently bought this clock and I love the way it looks on the night stand. The size is right and I like the way it works. It is quiet at night and the alarm is just enough to wake you up. The button on top, which lights up the face of the clock, is easy to access if you want to see the time in the dark. I would definitely recommend this clock."
4,Attractive clock,"Would have preferred one just a little larger for my fireplace mantle, but this size does not detract from the picture above, yet reasonably elegant. And, legible from across the room. It most certainly would be perfect as a bedside alarm clock."
5,PERFECT NIGHTSTAND CLOCK,"I ordered this clock after mine, that I'd had for 27 years was broken. Make no mistake, the clock still worked. The battery compartment back finally broke off after years of either being dropped or thrown to the floor when the alarm went off. (-: My older Seiko, which was given to me as a gift, still worked perfectly, and I'm betting this one will give me the same dependable service. In addition to it being a quality timepiece, it quite pretty too. If you need an alarm clock you can't go wrong with this one for yourself or as a gift."
1,Worst movie ever!!!!,"I have been looking forward to this movie release for months. I loved the first blue crush, and knew that this was not a sequel by any means, but I was severely disappointed with it. The acting was horrible, the script was poorly written, the editing was choppy, and there are even a couple scenes where you could tell they were in front of a green screen. Pretty sure the budget on this movie was 2 cokes and a candy bar. If Justin Beiber, and Rebecca Black collaborated on a movie together, Blue Crush 2 would be their love child."
2,Hyde park with flowers in her hair - yak on the floor,"Ok... it's really not a sequel. The music is... well Yuppie-wannabe-rock-cry-baby-music which sucks big time. This movie is horrible, I'm glad I only rented it. The Grateful dunces or Dead have their logos all over everything. The only thing missing is a hippie with a North Vietnamese flag painted on their forehead. A funny thing about the movie is no one works but they have gas and food. The first movie is so much better it's not funny."
2,Not so good....,"I LOVE the Planet of the Apes movies, but this one was poor indeed. It was far too friendly of a movie, they made it with children in mind, and not the real fans. I wished for this movie to end soon after it began, it brings shame to this great series... but what can you expect once they got rid of Heston? I would recommend this movie to people who want to see the entire series... but that's all. Definitely the worst of the saga."
1,The budget got smaller and it shows,"The third film, ""Escape..."" was a complete joke. They must have made this on a shoe-string budget because there were no special effects and they probably used the masks from the first two films. The plot was idiotic and I weep at thought of this nonsense."
2,anchorofmercy,"Bags seem a little stiff, not as soft as you would think. Already showing some signs of age...not weather related, just drying out. Straps are already coming apart...very thin material...not very well made. Manufacturer has a two year warrenty...don't think they will make it."
5,Great Value Saddle Bags!!,"I put these on my 99 Harley Sportster without brackets and fit excellent. They look great. For what they are priced at, you get real leather and the quality is descent as well. Their customer service is amazing."
