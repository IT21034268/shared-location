2,Huge Printhead Problems,"My S750 worked well for 2 years. All of the sudden, however, the print quality dramatically decreased and an error message indicated that the printhead needed to be replaced. So, I reluctantly bought a new printhead ($50), installed it, and... now the printer does not print at all. All trouble-shooting does not help. Canon's tech support responded quickly, but the suggestions do not solve the problem. Canon's final advice: take it in to be serviced. However, in the meantime, I have lost interest in wasting more time and money and decided to purchase a new printer. Clearly, it won't be another Canon. I cannot recommend this product."
3,I loved it but it broke,"It's a great printer but after a month and not a lot of printing, it made a really bad noise and stopped working. Canon says I have to send it in to be repaired...not the answer I was hoping for. I'd buy another one if I knew the problem was just a fluke. It's fast, and the quality is really impressive."
1,Printer was good when it worked!,"I had the S750 for a while and it worked great. The color print on plain paper was fast and accurate. It wasn't a photo printer but it did a decent job of printing photos on photo paper. I recently started using an off brand ink carts and had good results until the black stopped working. I deep cleaned and aligned the heads, tried everything to clean the clog, but no luck. I thought the non-Canon inks caused the problem but reading from these posts it looks like a weak print head design was the cause. Since buying a new print head was almost the cost of a new printer I chose to replace the Canon, and let me tell you it wasn't another Canon printer! I love Canon cameras but no more Canon printers for me."
1,Don't waste your money,The Sport case does not fit the nano. The speakers are very low volume even with the volume on the nano set to maximum. Very disappointing.
1,A total waste of money for me,"Who cares about what it looks like, the whole purpose of an alarm clock is to make sure you wake up on time. This alarm isn't loud enough for heavy sleepers like me. I tried using this a couple of times and both times I ended up not hearing it, overslept, and was late for my college class. Which, btw, seriously ticked me off. I bought it because another reviewer had said the alarm was loud...sorry, but it's not.It now sits unused in my desk drawer. Total waste of money."
1,"Grrrr, this thing sucks!","So, this clock woke me up alright! The snooze didn't work, and then I couldn't turn it off! I had to rip the batteries out of it to get it to stop...It is very cheaply made (explains the price I guess), but yeah it works just fine as long as you don't need to use the snooze ever."
5,"Inexpensive, easy to use--love it!!!","I wanted a simple, inexpensive digital alarm clock and this one is perfect. It is easy to set up, easy to use, big numbers are easy to read. Travels great. I actually keep it on my desk when not traveling to track another time zone for work. I'm totally satisfied."
2,The light doesn't work,"The clock doesn't light up at all. It does keep time, though, so it's not worth sending this $10 clock back."
1,Stopped working after falling once,"I knocked the clock off my bedside table just once, and it stopped working. The light for the alarm would flash, but no sound. Who doesn't knock an alarm clock on the ground by mistake every once in a while?"
2,obnoxious alarm clock,"On the plus side - this travel alarm is compact and will travel well. I like to use these small alarm clocks as a battery back up to my regular alarm and also as a second alarm. This one has a very loud high pitched beeping alarm. It also flashes a red lit up time screen when it is beeping. It's like having an emergency vehicle in your bedroom. I also used to have a travel alarm clock where you could set the minutes between the snooze alarms, but this only gives you a two minutes maybe before it starts loudly beeping and flashing red again. I am not too happy with this alarm clock for my use of it. I have yet to take it on a trip, but it would most likely wake up everyone in a house where I may be staying as a guest. It's really got an obnoxious beeping alarm."
2,poor craftsmanship,"I had a travel clock from Timex years ago similar to this that I really liked. I was hoping this would be a good replacement, but no. The screen often fades out unless you position it just so (not using the cover/stand for stability), and each time it fades out you must reprogram the time and alarm. Also there doesn't seem to be a way to adjust the snooze length. Maybe I just got a bad apple, if it worked right it would be very handy for travel and for those of us who don't want to use the cell phone as an alarm clock."
3,Nothing great about this,"this clock is probably worth the small price, but it is hard to see the display from straight on. What's the story with that?"
5,LOVE this clock!!,"I love this little travel alarm clock we have had it for years and have had no problems with it at all. I love the blue glow as its not as jarning as other colors displays on clocks. It's been everywhere with us. You cant go wrong with this. I dont understand some of these reviews, this has been dropped more times I can count, has been everywhere, I sleep on TOP of it every night (its UNDER my pillow) and I check it about 10 times a night I hit the glow lite button, its been stepped on and this thing holds up. The batteries last a long time too. I cant find anything to complain about this clock, it's pretty much perfect. I'm sad I cant find this in the stores anymore to give as gifts."
1,broken upon arrival,"I received this clock a few days late because Amazon chose to ship this the cheapest possible way which was USPS instead of UPS or Fedex. I was suppose to receive this 2 day with my Prime membership and received it 4 days later instead. So much for my membership benefits! This clocks display could NOT be viewed from a straight on view. The only way I could read the display was looking at it almost from directly above or from a side view angle. Also, when I pushed the blue backlight display button, I couldn't see anything, but Blue. This is defective and I am returning it for another try."
1,It last four months.,I ordered this clock in April. It stopped working correctly in July. I expected more. The clock face (actual time) became unreadable. The numbers dimmed to the point that they were unreadable. I tried to change the batteries but NO JOY.
1,Don't buy it,"This clock should not be sold by Amazon, unless they don't care about their reputation. It doesn't keep time the alarm system is not accurate and it simply stopped working. Other than that it's ok. Remember to remove the batteries before you throw it out!"
1,A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY,"I don't understand all the raving reviews about this useless alarm clock.Mine, when set up, buzzes for less than a minute, in such a low tone that you can happily sleep throughthe entire time and wake up two hours later without even noticing.Additionally, it would be supposed, when you do not hear the alarm the first time, to buzz again at 4 minute intervals: IT DOESN'T.In simpler words: it only sounds for less than a minute at the set time, it has a very low tone, and stops dead there, until the day after.No appeal, no redemption. You are going to be late for work if you rely on this awful clock.It is a waste of time, money and hope.I purchased it because it bears the name of ""Elgin"", a very good watchmaker. But I went back to my ""Made in China"" $6 alarm clock, that is reliable, humble anddoes not require fussing about."
3,Decent portable alarm clock,I was looking for an inexpensive portable alarm clock. I've had this one about a month and like it so far.Pros:- alarm is loud enough- back light is bright enough- has protective cover for digits when traveling- non-bulky with folding stand- can check alarm set time by pushing buttonCons:- hard to see the numbers except if you're looking down at an angle at the face of the clock- to set minutes you have to cycle all the way through...not a big deal- a little tricky to slide the switch between setting the alarm and arming it and turning it off (I'm worried I'll slide it to the wrong setting)
1,Only snoozes 4 times,"It only snoozes 4 times. After that, it just doesn't wake up again. Defeats the entire purpose of the device."
1,Made in China has caught up to us!,"My Timex Indiglow travel alarm finally died, so I bought this Elgin clockSPECIFICALLY because it had the blue light feature. I need to be able to hit the sleep-button and see the time at night. Right out of the box, everything worked EXCEPT the blue light.I will be returning it for a refund. Amazon is great! Crap made in China isn't!!"
2,Cheap Plastic,"I purchased this because I wanted an alarm that did not need to be plugged into the wall, but I was disappointed with how cheap the plastic is. Looks and feels junky."
4,Good travel clock,"Compact, easy to use, large button to push to see time in dark. Only wish I could see the time without pushing the button"
4,THE McGRATH SISTERS REVOLT,"So what? The three McGrath sisters turn on the McGrath men. It's just a family custom. My name is McGrath, and my deranged sisters turned on me long ago. They're so vain, they'll probably think this thing's about them. They're so vain..."
2,Not as good in my opinion,I am a Woody Allen fan and bought this because of the reviews. I guess it was not my cup of tea. I couldn't watch it for more then 15 minutes. I wish I could figure out what exactly I didn't like about it.
2,defective dvd,"For a large part of the dvd, there was a great deal of skipping. The dvd is obviously defective. I haven't watched since. It would be great if we could get a replacement."
3,"Good Movie, Bad DVD . . . Find out Why!","This movie deserves only 3 stars instead of 3 for the following reasons:1) There are no extras other than the trailer on this DVD. Why didn't Columbia Home Video include the trailers for the two sequels? Why didn't they get Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita (academy-nominated for this role) or director John G. Avildsen to supply commentary?2) The movie was shot in 1.85:1 which means that the movie was shot full frame (1.33:1) but was projected in the theatre with the top and bottom blocked. This practice gives a widescreen look to movies. Since 'The Karate Kid' was done this way, pan and scan was not needed. You actually see more but this causes the composition to be a little off because there is so much space above the actor's heads. Funny thing, The Karate Kid parts 2 & 3 are letterboxed. Does this mean that an old video transfer was used for this DVD?3) Where's the Dolby 5.1?"
4,Pat really deserved his 'Oscar'!,"'Karate Kid' is not just an entertaining classic for the young at hearts, it's a lesson for a lifetime, this touching, funny and dramatic movie is a portait of a shy newcomer boy, who must face the big bullies from his school in a karate tournament, with help from his master, the scene-stealing Mr. Miyagi, and they become friends of a lifetime.This is one of the classic feel good movies you will stand up and cheer for."
5,John G. Avildsen's The Karate Kid,"This was a wonderful Action/Drama. It is directed by John G. Avildsen(Rocky). This movie is about a 17 year old named Daniel LaRusso(Ralph Macchio) who moves from Newark, New Jersey to Southern California with his mother(Randee Heller). When Daniel is invited to a beach party, he falls for Ali(Elisabeth Shue) a beautiful blonde girl. Daniel later gets into a fight with Johnny(William Zabka), a bully from a Karate group named the Cobra Kai. Then when school starts, Daniel becomes a target for the Cobra Kai and start to bully him many times(Soccer, Biking, on Halloween). Then Mr. Miyagi(Pat Morita) an Apartment Handyman from Okinawa, leaps to Daniel's defense. Then when Kreese(Martin Kove) becomes upset at Miyagi, he challenges him. Mr. Miyagi accepts the challenge at the Karate Tournament and that gives Mr. Miyagi two Months to train Daniel. This movie had great action and acting. I highly reccomend this."
1,Must be Widescreen!!,"This is a great movie and is well deserving of a widescreen presentation, fully restored and with commentary. It is what I believe one of the best movies of the 1980's and it is a shame that in a time when so many mediocre movies are given the star treatment in the DVD world, this one is so unbelievably substandard. I will not buy this movie until it is on widescreen at the very least. Give this movie and its' fans a break! Do it right!"
2,Disappointment,"I'm a big fan of Mike Allred's work, particularly his early Graphic Muzik stuff, which is where the G-Men From Hell first debuted. That said, I didn't really love this movie, and if you're not previously familiar with the G-Men in comic form, I can't imagine you'd like this movie at all. Despite its low budget, it really had some recognizable actors, I'll give it that. But the plot seemed muddled and the film and sound quality, or lack thereof, didn't help either. Plus, what the heck was the point of Cheetah Man? He did nothing in the film. Listening to Mike Allred's commentary was odd because he's apparently completely oblivious to the movie's problems, apparently loving every frame of the film. Perhaps it's because it's a movie of his characters. I suppose that would make me like it more, too. But alas, they aren't my characters and I didn't. Just read Madman comics instead!"
5,leaning alot all at once.,"I haven;t finished it but so farit is great and I am processing alot of what is written. I am a massage therapist and so I love to learn all the time and this is new for me. it is not like reflexology, it is much deeper and I am still processing what I am learning."
5,Amazing tool!,"Excellent quality. Cuts like nothing and the locking feature is extremely handy, not to mention the loop!"
3,Maybe too complete?,"This edition of the 1940 Fargo concert starts with a good, very bluesy version of ""The Mooche"". Duke Ellington and his band alternate between up-tempo swingers like ""Pussy Willow"" and ballads, sometimes with swing-era singing like ""There Shall Be No Night"". The 2-CD set loads the first CD with good songs, both classics like ""Caravan"" and lesser-known songs like ""Harlem Air Shaft"". The sound is serviceable, for the most part. All in all, the first CD is an enjoyable listen, even for someone who prefers bebop up to present-day styles of jazz over swing. The second CD is more of the same, just not as good. The sound is in some parts muddier, and the songs, as a whole, aren't as strong. Plus, there are more song fragments, like the 31-second ""God Bless America"" or the 20-second ""Chaser"". I'd give the first disc 4 stars, and the second one 3, for a total of 3.5 for the set. There are other versions of this concert out there, they may have different sound or different track lists."
3,Not too bad for a 'super group',"Honestly, this CD was a lot better than I thought it would be. They mix the tunes up well with instrumentals peppered throughout. If you're a fan of Ty Tabor of King's X, this CD is a must. Compulsive fans of Dream Theater might need this CD to complete their collection. I'm definitely interested in their next CD."
5,Perfectly fine!,"I got this just to place under my desk at work to keep my lunches cold everyday, ive had the thing plugged in since JUNE and havent had a problem with it - im not sure what this ""10 hour"" thing is that everyone else is talking about! (I also didnt read the manual) .... But no problems with it!! It works perfect!"
5,Keeping It Real,This was a great book. I read it in one day. The characters in this book were like real life people. They had real life issues that are happening everyday. I am originally from Chicago so the references to places in Chicago were great. They made me a little homesick. I have enjoyed all of your books and can't wait until your next release. If you have not bought this book you need to buy it now. Keep up the good work!!!!
3,Usual Drama.........,"This novel plays along the same vein as a usual Kimberla Roby novel. DRAMA with lots of twists and turns. You have one Sistah that is on the heavy side dealing with ""man"" issues; another Sistah whose man is avoiding commitment like bird flu; and then Miss Looney Toon! It was a good read even though I thought the ending didn't quite fit. Keep it up Ms. Roby, looking forward to your next novel."
3,VERY PREDICTABLE,"VERY PREDICTABLE!!!I predicted exactly what would happen and sure enough.. no surprises here.It was a good read, but nothing new, fresh, and exciting"
5,great read,"I took this book to Las Vegas, mainly to read on the fligt out. Once arriving in our hotel room, could hardly put it down. I really enjoyed the characters, mainly because we all know these people and have them in our lives. Needless to say, in between hanging out during vacation, was able to finish the book in 2 days.Keep up the good writing, I've gone back and read several of her books and have enjoyed every single one."
3,Australia Wide Cookbook,"This book will make many dream of Australia's beaautiful landscape.Ken Duncan is Australia's most well known photographer. Some intriuging recipes, but lots of pics. A nice gift!"
1,Horrid Adaptation of the English classic,"This version of Lady Chatterley's Lover by D.H. Lawrence is horrid. Poorly directed, mediocre acting, although Kristel tried, an actor can only do so much. It's painful to watch this. Nothing can come close to the classic book, but if you want a film version, try 1993's version with Joely Richardson, which is beautifully done and more closely tries to capture the classic."
2,Waiting for more...,"I saw this collection in the store, but did not buy it because my favourites were not included. I have been waiting for a CD release of 'Dreams'... where is it??? I have a beaten up old cassette that is almost unplayable now. Grace, your solo work also deserves its own 'Best Of'..."
2,Not a good Blu-ray transfer comparing to the Criterion DVD,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. This is a five star movie and my two star rating applies only to the Blu-ray transfer. I have the Criterion Collection Edition of this movie. In comparing the Blu-ray edition and the Criterion DVD edition, I found the Blu-ray edition to have a less appealing color palette. It is somewhat bluish, less saturated, and sometimes looks magenta. The Criterion edition has an overall warmer tone. The movie itself also does not seem to benefit all that much from the higher resolution transfer either. I don't know if it's the definition of the film or if the transfer wasn't well done. You are not going to see the kind of sharpness you see on more recent Blu-ray transfers such as The Dark Knight or Revolutionary Road.Excellent film, though if you have the DVD already it is probably not worth it to get the Blu-ray version."
3,No Way to this BLU -RAY.....2 star disc 5 star movie!,Don't bother with this Blu-ray...I just watched the 2 disc collectors edition a couple days back and loved it so when I spotted this in the store today I snapped it up. Trouble is....without a serious A/B test....it didn't really look ANY better than the standard disc and is twice the price. Frankly ...I wish I had NOT purchased this on BLU-RAY and its one of my favorite movies. Much of this will no doubt be due to the available light photography for the film which doesn't upgrade well..but be warned.
2,The Silence of the Lambs - Criterion Collection - DVD,"I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater but the Criterion Collection DVD was very disappointing. The so-called deleted scenes in the DVD were very poorly done and were in fact not deleted in the original theatrical release, but left out of all the home versions. The commentary track, recorded 3 years after the movie came out, was overly analytical. None of the extras in the Criterion DVD make it worth the extra money. The cheaper Image Entertainment DVD has closed captioning and keeps the original, thought-provoking cover art. Of the 3 versions I've seen, the VHS tape is the best value for money. It cost much less and has all the essential elements."
1,A poor transfer of this great film. Barely beter than a DVD. Buy it under $10 or rent it...,"Although many older films are making their way into Blu-Ray with very high quality and recent source transfers, or were transferred to digital originally with future high definition requirements in mind, such does not seem to be the case with ""The Silence of the Lambs"". The image suffers from waxy skin tones, excessive DNR noise reduction, excessive sharpening, black crush in near black ranges of the image and generally mediocre tone and detail. Of course it's ""better"" than a DVD, if only because what appears to be the same transfer used for the DVD benefits from the added bandwidth and resolution of Blu-Ray. But it appears to be the same mediocre source as originally made for the DVD, hardly up to the standards of new 2k and 4k masters mastered into AVC or VC-1 codec. A bargain disc, worth $9.99 but not the premium that's being charged for it. Rent it."
5,A Great Movie,This is one of the best movies I Have Ever Scean I Saw this on TV a few weeks ago this is like the only horror movie to win best picture IT won 5 big academy Awards including best picturebest directorBest adapted Screenplaybest Actor [Anthony Hopkins]as Hannibal Lecterbest actress [Jodie Foster] as Clarice StarlingAnd this is also my favorite Horror Movie
1,Sick.,"When your blind friend, God rest his soul, advises you not to see a movie, listen to him! I sure wish I had. This movie did not give me as many night mares as Knight Moves did, but it lacked a good plot.There are cannibals in this world, but I do not see how following a psycho killer who also eats his victims is entertainment. In my opinion, there is nothing redeeming about this movie.My advice is to avoid it at all cost."
2,"Well made, well acted.","But why glorify such subject matter? The Academy holds this movie up as a high-point of artistic achievement. Getting to know the workings of a psychotic mind can enrich you life, apparently."
1,I hate this movie,I truly hate this movie. It disgusts me. I'm not sure how else to put it. I felt like the movie tried to somehow glorify the character of Hanniabl Lecter and that was extrememly offensive and unsettling to me. I've sworn of all other horror movies because of this one. It touched on things that were way too real for me.
3,Classic movie-- Terrible DVD!,"I happen to own several other Criterion Collection DVD's, all of which are magnificent-- excellent video transfers, superior audio, and a huge assortment of extras. The extras on this DVD are really quite good-- the commentary is fabulous, and the deleted scenes (despite being rough edits) are interesting. However, the video transfer and audio leave a lot to be desired. I couldn't believe how poor the video was-- lots of graininess and debris-- it was almost like watching a bad film print with a dirty-lensed projector! Terrible! I love this movie, but I'm incredibly disappointed with Criterion on this one!"
3,Thriller,"Won 5 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. A psychopath kills women across the midwest. The FBI sends someone to interview a prisoner to provide clues. Hannibal Lector is a cannibal who agrees to helponly if she'll feed is desires on her own life. Stars Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. Followed by a sequel named Hannibal. I thought it was a worthwhile film to see at least once."
3,Great Movie - Terrible Audio,"The audio of the Criterion Collection version of this movie was so bad I returned the DVD. It was full of clicks, varying volume, and an indescribeable distortion like I was in a 50 gallon drum listening to this DVD. The content of the movie is the same as the theatrical release, however, the additional features are merely fluff.How they screwed up the audio on this is beyond me."
4,EFFECTIVE HORROR FILM BUT.....,"If you can definitely get the Criterion Collection version of this film. It has many extra features such FBI stuff, director's commentary, etc.One of the things that has always bothered me, is a kind of glamorizing of this cannibalistic murderer.I see where a sequal is being made. I suspect that Lechter will be in some way rehabilitated.Another thing is the picture of Jamie Gumm. I thought he looked kind of silly and not all that ominousA more realistic picture of a serial killer can be found in ""Henry, Portait of a Serial Killer."""
5,Hilarious!,"Always liked it as a kid and still do! So much talent in this movie! Fred Savage was really good at playing an adult trapped inside a kid's body. That's really good for an 11 or 12 year old (at the time). And of course, Judge Reinhold was excellent playing a kid trapped inside an adult's body. Cracks me up! Definite classic!"
2,"Watch it on cable, it's cheaper.","While the movie has its moments, I recommend you just watch comedy central, it's bound to be on there at least once a month. I mean don't have a judge reinhold spaz or anything, just check it out for free, save some cash. By the way, Reinhold delivers a tour de force performance, I'm sure he was proud of this role."
4,"Index is not too good, but.......",We like the personal and conversational approach that he takes to the work. The outlining of the tours and his notice of things that may be very helpful are very good. He comes across as having 'been there and done that' and enjoys sharing it with you.
4,It was better than I expected.,"I ordered this book because I had to read it for my English class and I thought it was just another boring book. As I was reading it, it became a bit more interesting than I thought. If it weren't for my English class I would have never read this book."
5,Hilarious,"I originally didn't want to see this film(I am 14 and it is black and white, you know how it is)but my parents made me. Before it was over I was asking my parents if we could go out an buy it the next day. My favorite part is when Gen. Buck Turgison(George C. Scott)tells the president(Peter Sellers) that US bombers are going to attack their targets inside of Russia. Scott's facial expressions in this scene alone make this movie one to see over and over again. This is a film for all ages(although a few parts might go over a youngster's head), and I can't recomend it enough."
4,Still a Classic,"Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Two-Disc Special Edition)Of the four major classic Anti-War movies (Dr Stranglove-War / The Day the Earth Stood Still-SciFi / FailSafe-Drama / On the Beach-Melodramatic); Dr Strangelove or How I Learned to Quit Worrying and Love the Bomb is the most humorous, pogniant and difficult to dismiss of them all. Sometimes your have to revisit a movie to grasp just how amazing a cinematagraphy adventure it really is. Dr Strangelove is that movie. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, it possess an insane humor, scenes that still reverberate in movies today (Slim Pickens riding a Thermonuclear Bomb down to Earth like a bronking stallion) and the absurdity of a Mine-Shaft gap! If you've never seen this movie, I urge you to take a look. It is well worth your time and a worthy addition to any DVD collectors library."
3,they should redo this only way more over the edge,another great kubrik film.this is all about a nuke war.all the important people are dead and down the chain of command somewhere are a bunch of crazy people.they get to make decisions about how to run the war.the kids wont be amused.stanley kubrik did it so you know youll be entertained.its not true but the point is it could be.
5,Watch This Movie and Sleep Better At Night,"This movie offers the best tongue and cheek commentary on the absurdities of war. I am sure this movie has been heavily ""borrowed"" from by Hollywood. The ""Survival Kit Content Check"" scene reminded me alot about the more recent ""duct tape your windows"" survival tactics. If you believe that the end of the world will come in a flash of light, this movie will validate you."
5,How to increase your pleasure,By accident I read Richard Rhodes' DARK SUN (a history of the A-bomb) before I viewed this film. Hard to believe how deep Kubrick's wit could cut into real life at the time he made the film. DR STRANGEGLOVE puts the Cold War to shame.
5,Review of Dr. Strangelove,Excellent black and white film from 1964 starring Peter Sellers and George C. Scott.A must for your personal comedy collection.Directed by Stanley Kubrick.
3,love not war,"Those who support nuclear efforts and mass destruction against weaker countries of non-democtratice origins are mad, just like most of the characters in this farce."
3,"Fantastic movie, but badly in need of restoration","This movie is a classic and one of Kubrick's finest, but I was surprised at how many pops and scratches were on the disc. I'm assuming that the DVD was made from the best print obtainable, which makes me think that the master print is damaged or not available. The quality varies from scene to scene, but generally looks like a print that has a lot of miles on it. I hope that the studio goes to the trouble of restoring this film someday soon."
2,cheepy quality :(,"Because the way it's designed (the edge is closed), it only punches sheet that are the same size as the ones used in a daytime or smaller. If you want just a little large sheet you will not be able to do it.The quality does not impress me either... On the first test punch I tried, it got jammed even though it was just one sheet of paper.I would return it if I would have bought it at a local merchant, but it's not worth the hassle of boxing it and going to the post office.My opinion is: this punch is worth about $5.00"
2,not all nostalgia is good,"In '83 I was 8 years old, and I thought Krull was a seriously cool movie. Hell, I even owned the Atari game. So when Krull was released on DVD I was excited to revisit the story and fill in the gaps of my memory (I think I saw it last in '85 or '86). A mere 20 minutes ago the DVD stopped spinning in my player, and I am left with a burning question: ""Why did I like this movie so much?"" I am not exactly sure, but I think it had something to do with there being a cyclops and a giant throwing-star-like weapon called the ""Glave."" It certainly wasn't for the plot, special effects, or character development... which I find suprisingly mediocre now that I'm in my 20's. So, Krull hasn't held up for me like some other 80's flicks, but those who still get their kicks from it will find a nice picture and good DD sound. The disc has two commentary tracks which I probably won't listen to, but it's nice to see ""B-films"" like Krull get a nice DVD release."
1,impossible digital copy,"I can NOT get the digital copy to unlock, which was the only reason I bought this version. It says my internet explorer isn't the correct version (it is) and it's not the default browser (it is). I've downloaded firmware, updates, read all the FAQs and help pages - nothing. It won't open in iTunes, the only program I actually want to open it, or any other program for that matter."
4,outdated,"like a lot of fantasy movies of the past, this movie is outdated. some of the effects just haven't stood the test of time. the movie is still enjoyable but probably only to those that remember it fondly as a kid. when this movie came out i would have given it 5 stars but i just can't do that now. if you've never seen this movie before i suggest renting it before buying it.also i wouldn't let young children watch this. there are a few scenes that might scare a young child. i know it's only PG but the rating system was a lot more lax back in the day... i'd prob say it would be PG-13 today."
4,Krull: A Masterpiece of 80's Cheesiness,"Oh goodness... this is the kind of movie that is watched a million times in somebody's dork-haven basement where all the Dungeons-and-Dragons and Magic-the-Gathering sessions are held. This movie is the epitome of terrible acting, plot holes the size of Alaska and special effects that are so bad they make you cringe. I give it 4 stars, though, because it's the kind of movie I will watch over and over and over again--even to the point of being able to recite it back. If I was the sort of person without the ability to see past the cheesiness and utter stupidity of this movie I wouldn't bother even contemplating watching it... but if you like suspension of belief, and a good old-fashioned early-80's low-budget fairy tale with a sci-fi twist, then you should go for it."
4,80's Fantasy Quest Worth Going On,"I think the best thing you can say about Krull is although it's not a masterpiece, it sure entertains on a Saturday afternoon.Marshall and Anthony are ok leads and the rest of the cast, including a young Liam Neeson, Robbie Coltrane and Freddie Jones are very good.Bresslaw's (from the Carry On movies) cyclops looks a bit shabby but on the whole it really is quite a good film and worth adding to your fantasy collection."
3,Not the best fantasy,"I saw Krull when it first came out in theaters, and while I must concede that the plot is rather lame, 2 things stand out for me in this fantasy movie: the musical score, and the part where Prince Colwyn and the robbers catch and ride the fabulous Firemares. That was my favorite part of the movie, as I am an avid horse-lover, and recognized the horses as Clydesdales right off. That fantasy ride on those Clydesdales would strongly appeal to any genuine horse-lover,and make the movie a must-have for horse-lovers. Plus, the music adds an unforgettable aspect to this wonderful fantasy sequence. No, it's not a great movie, but it was made to be a fun fantasy, not an Oscar contender."
5,WHO POOPED IN THE PARK,"A delightfully entertaining and informative book for a 3 1/2 year old who loves to say ""poop"". For a child who lives in Colorado and takes many trips to the mountains, he was amazed how much could be learned by his 'funny"" word. It sparked a curiosity in a child that was delightful."
1,What a Disappointment!,"First, I've enjoyed the prior Fremont Jones books. But her ""independence,"" coupled with her pride in her own abilities (which of course is never misplaced) is, quite frankly, becoming quite tiresome. I was also extremely disappointed with the plot -- wouldn't it have been far more fascinating (and maybe better for our heroine's ego)if Fremont had been WRONG about her stepmother? I often compare Fremont Jones to Amelia Peabody -- increasingly, Fremont is paling in comparison!"
3,Corny,"It has a potentially fascinating plot for a comedy - but half way it gives way to sentimentality instead - and the whole story ends up rather weak. I know most people would not like this, but I'd say this is a movie for those who're only romantics in the conventional sense. I'm sure a lot of people out there imagine saying those 'heart-felt' lines in this movie in front of a girl or something - or enjoy imagining they're such romantic souls who're capable of explosion of such feelings - but those who're more aware of complexities of such situations and on a higher level would see it as unrealistic. I'd appreciate it more if the director had done it with more honesty - which I am sure he is capable of, having seen his other stuff and his interviews, etc."
5,Best Kevin Smith film yet !,"Being a Kevin Smith fan, my opinion may be one sided(Well, I didn't really get Mallrats...does that count??).This is in my top 10 movies of all time.I have heard alot of negative stuff from the lesbian community over the years, in my personal life,(gay friends), as well on amazon.I don't get it. I think it really shows all sides. Not being a lesbian, or even a woman for that matter, maybe it's something I don't and won't understand.But I really do think for the average joe who fell for the wrong girl, for whatever reasons...this is a true gem."
3,The first half of this movie is one of the funniest ever...,The first half of Chasing Amy is one of the funniest movies of all time! Only when Ben Affleck's character starts babbling to Joey Lauren Adams in the car in the rain is where it all starts to fall apart. Still if it was just that it would still be great. But when he comes up with his little scheme to make everything all right between his girlfriend and best friend/business partner - er - The Tracer (the comic book convention scenes were classic) - well all pleasure in the movie vanished like someone kicked me in the nads. Don't get me wrong - I really like this movie - and I love the first half - but too bad the last half disappointed. Of course Dogma was I think the first movie that Kevin Smith got completely right all the way through - aweseome - but Chasing Amy is still well worth a watch. I'll buy the DVD for sure - especially since it's Criterion.
5,The best movie of the century.,It's funny and excuilerating. One minute your laugh the next your mad at the actors. If you like a good laugh this is a must see.
2,"Low resolution source, over priced blu ray transfer","Chasing Amy is a decent movie, but it was filmed on very low quality Super 16 film stock. A blu ray transfer can't possibly make the amatuer video quality look much better. Compounding this travesty is the ridiculous high price for this blu ray transfer. I have home videos filmed in higher quality than this film. Save your money and stick with the Criterion DVD release or at least wait until this blu ray drops to a reasonable price."
4,Serious Kevin Smith?,"Kevin makes his move into drama with this excellent piece that is concerned with the difficult task of confronting your lover's past. This film well acted, well directed and contains all of the elements you have come to associate with Smith's writing and directing. It is funny and insightful and has earned its' place among my favorites."
3,"I chased an ""Amy"" and won!","I like this movie and can not wait for it to come out on DVD.I fell in love with a lesbian and and in time she fell in love with me. She is now my fiancee and we are soon to be wed. Now, id did not happen quite like in the movie, but all you people who say this is a story that never happens well it does. It does work the other way around too, I know a guy who was bi and mainly dated guys, but this girl swept him off his feet and they are married with a kid!Anyway, I like the movie and you should pick it up"
5,Jason Lee is Hilarious,Chasing Amy is one of my Alltime favorite movies Along with KS's other Films (Clerks & Mallrats). Jason Lee takes the show away with a comedic performance only to be riviled by Jeff Anderson in Clerks.If you liked Jason Lee in Mallrats this more of the same hilarious stuff
4,Kevin Smith movie you can see with (open minded) girlfriend,"Yet again, Kevin Smith does it with sharp dialogue and an offbeat storyline. If you enjoy his movies for what they are, well written, insightful, irreverent, and about the slacker in all of us you will enjoy this one too. If you are just a fan of the Jay and Silent Bob wackiness, this one might be a little mushy for you. Don't get me wrong, 'Amy' has plenty of references to Star Wars, comics, the first two movies (Clerks, Mallrats), and all of the other things that we have grown accustomed to from Smith, but it does have a more intense storyline about the relationship between the main characters. All in all a great movie, and one that has enough relationship storyline that it isn't just a comic book freak movie that you would be scared to let your girlfriend know that you own."
2,A poor follow up to Clerks,"I came to this film with high expectations after watching the foul-mouthed but funny Clerks, but I was sorely disappointed. This film is not in the same class. While the substandard black and white photography in Clerks added to the endearing ad hoc nature of that film, in this (although in colour) it just appears cheap and nasty.A lot of the dialogue is rather stilted and inaudible, and the script, although subtler than Clerks, is nowhere near as funny. Why Criterion chose to give this film their fine treatment is something of a mystery."
1,oh please!!,"How this movie could have made it to anyones top anything list is a mystery to me! Did anyone actually watch this movie?? Hello!! Here's a guy who tells his Bisextual girlfreind that all she needs is a man...and of course he gets her in the end "" oh it all must have been a phaze she was going through or something.""What's wrong with a good old fashioned lesbian love story??"
5,One of Ben Affleck's best acting & Kevin Smith's best movie!,"This movie is so deep and amazing!! Kevin Smith did such a wonderful comedy/drama mixed together, he knows what he's doing!!It's about a comic book artist(Affleck) who falls for a gay woman(Adams), I'm not going to tell the rest it is deep!!! Ben does such a wonderful and amazing job in this movie, so many emotions and feelings in this movie! A MUST HAVE!! Trust me you'll love it! Especially a scene in the rain!"
5,"""Nobody steps on a church in my town!""","I loved these movies as a kid growing up, and I still like to watch them. The first film is excellent, and while the second one is still a mild disapointment it is nice to have a 2-Disc set with both films together. But it would have been nice to get some more or new extra features (the cartoon episodes aren't interesting), but at this low price I'm not complaining."
1,bad disc,"I bought this item as a gift, and when we tried to play it, the disc didnt work. It had a crack in it. I, along with the reciever, was very dissapointed."
5,spooky!,"I was rather young when this movie was first released, and it gave me nightmares! Now, I find it a great comedy with some spooky moments. The extra features on the DVD are fairly interesting, and rather well put together."
1,Terrible Copy Transfer,"I have a brand new laptop that I downloaded this too and the copy was horrid. Blurry, bad coloring, just like an old VHS. I didn't expect that. I thought it would be an upgraded HD version."
5,Still StayingPuft,"The movie is classic. Period. Nuff said. End of discussion. Bill Murray is a legend. Every man should have at least one Bill Murray DVD in his collection, and if you only have one, then Ghostbusters has to be it. Sure others will go on about Caddyshack and blah, blah, blah. Those people are idiots. Sure Cadyshack was great, but it is no Ghostbusters. Ghostbusters started a completely new genre: modern sci-fi comedy.The DVD itself is great. Nice menus, engaging commentaries, etc., but the DVD still feels a little ""light"" on extras for such a classic movie. Hopefully it'll get the royal DVD treatment on it's 20th anniversary release."
3,"Great film, mediocre transfer","It's worth saying ""I LOVE THIS FILM!"" for context.The Blu-Ray transfer, though, is quite disappointing. All in all, for a movie of that's actually newer than Blade Runner or The Empire Strikes Back, the quality is way lower than one would expect.Interestingly, the worst grain problems are in the introductory scenes in the public library, and the one ""the dead are rising?"" scene, which is just terribly grainy. After the library, the quality gets somewhat better, but as noted above, it simply falls short of what one should expect from a high-budget blockbuster from that era."
4,Takes Me Back...,"Amusing classic. Nothing deep, just some laughs from the 80s that the whole family can watch."
2,I have the guts to say it...,"Since no one else will, I'll point out what the problem with this movie is: it has aged poorly. The first half is still pretty funny, but it peters out into a bunch of badly dated special effects.The DVD was highly touted when it first came out as being ""loaded"" with ""goodies."" Well, I have come to pretty much ignore extras on dvds at this point, but I will point out that compared to the extravaganzas being released these days, this dvd is nothing to write home about.This movie will always be noteworthy for becoming such a huge hit, but time has not been kind."
5,Ghostbusters is still great,This double feature of Ghostbusters 1 & 2 is excellent and they hold up very well. My kids loved them.
3,"Love the movie, but grainy","I would think technology had reached a point where cleaning up the graininess would have been a problem long passed, but apparently it isn't. The BR version is just as grainy as the DVD version. As a matter of fact, if you're looking to buy the blu ray version in hopes of it being better than the DVD version, don't waste your money. The DVD version is the same if not better than the blu ray version. It is sad, because this movie is one of my all time favorites. It is a classic, but very disappointed with the blu ray transfer."
1,"Bad Transfer AND the ""extra's"" suck","One of my top 5 all-time favorite movies. But, as has been noted by other reviews, the transfer is terrible. To add insult to injury, the special features are not special at all. The DVD collectors series looks better on my HD screen, and is packed with extra's. Very disappointed."
2,Que es esso?,"This is one of my favorite movies, unfortunately I can't share it with my family. They only speak Spanish. I don't know if the studios realize that soon over half of the film watching public will be spanish speaking. And these people won't be able to buy or enjoy this type of film."
2,Few funny moments in 90 minutes,"It has some funny moments. Overall, there are too few enjoyable scenes in 90 minutes.Fans of the cartoon series will certainly love it."
4,Awesome!,"Special Features are great, movies are obviously great, and the sketch book inside is awesome too."
1,Be Aware of what you are buying,"I purchased this book after carefully reviewing all of the customer reviews, however, I was very disappointed. The book focuses on healing via tarot, runes, crystals, I Ching, astrology, numerology, synchronicities, dreams, guided imagery, chanting, prayer,ritual and even channeling. If these are the methods you are interested in, then this is the book for you. If, however, this is not something you believe in or want to dabble in then this book is a waste of time. The author has done intuitive readings for many of the people in the book prior to putting them in her book. It came off as very hokey in my humble opinion...So know what you are getting into when you make this purchase."
3,not as good as the short-lived TV show,"I picked this up after watching Beau Bridges play Maximum Bob in the short-lived TV series, which had amazing razor sharp wit, and subtle irony. It is a sorry statement about the intelligence of TV viewers that it was cancelled and now we have ""reality TV."" The book was not as sharp as the TV show, which really refected Leonard's zany wit, but I probably liked the book more than I would have on it's own because it reminded me of the great show that I can't see any more."
1,Disappointed,I was disappointed in this product. The items did not fit tight in the pockets so would fall out. I could see that I couldn't use it. I ended up giving it away to a charity auction-sure hope the person who got it can use it somehow.
4,Cute and functional,It works just as you would expect from the photo. Seems very sturdy and well-designed. I expect this to last a long time.
2,Doesn't function well,"I was excited about purchasing this product and loved the idea of being able to carry my bucket and several tools in such a convient manner. However, I have found it difficult and irritating to use. Despite how firmly I secure the carrier to my 5 gallon bucket and how few tools I insert in the pockets, the carrier slides off after a short period of time. Very ittitating to have it and the tool end up on the ground. This happens with only one ot two tools or none. Spend too much time having to reattach several times only to have it slip off again. Totally defeats the purpose of its use."
5,Great product,"Now I can carry all my gardening tools with me rather than running back and forth to the basement to get yet another tool. Fits snugly around a 5-gallon bucket. I've only had it for a couple of months so can't speak to durability, but it's seems well made."
1,Pick something else,Quite disappointing and poor pictures... always the same man writing every article...I havee been reading it for a while and had the feeling of loosing my money.
1,Stay away from this one,"This album is a really crummy deal. It contains remixes from the previous album ""10.000 Hz Legend"". And bad ones at that. If your idea of fun is five different versions of ""Don't be Light"", then by all means, buy the album. If not, then stay away from it. Let's just hope it's the evil record corporation and not the boys in the band who've come up with this scam."
5,Too Good,"This is a great world war two movie, it is well acted by super stars.. I think its intense and the type of movie you can watch many times over..."
3,The Guns of Navarone Bluray,i little confused .. this really 50th Anniversay Edition in blu-ray.com ? but in case there's no word about 50th Anniversary. Picture is good not many grainy but to dark i think .. not very good. but Features 4/5 a lot of it. i don't have slipcase for this edition but i buy lowest ..
5,Silence the guns but not the movie,"0ne of the classic war movies of all time, this should not be missed. It tells the story of the impossible commando raid to spike a pair of deadly cannons. Of course, the guns are housed in an impregnable fortress on an enemy held island. Simple, right. Great casting with Gregory Peck as the reluctant leader, Anthony Quinn as his right hand man who also want to kill Peck, and David Niven as the explosive expert who wants no responsibility. Add in other colorful characters and a plot full of twists and turns for a rollicking good time. Pop up lots of popcorn and get a really large drink because this one runs over 2 and 1/2 hours. You will not want to stop as the action gets going."
5,"Excellent war film, with the best film transfer of this title.","Guns of Navarone is best known as one of the most interesting and adventurous war movies of the CinemaScope era. The Blu-Ray the promise of an impressive film and audio transfer, the first of which was not that good when the DVD was released. Highly recommended."
4,Intriguing war movie,"Action filled war movie, great story, great cast. Concerns a commando team small enough to allow growth of character for most of the members, but large enough to have a few killed off, adding to the intrigue. Plenty of unexpected turns to maintain the interest, even though the viewer assumes from the beginning that the ""objective"" will be attained. Unexpected romance ads spice to the dish. The ""effects"", great for 1961, are still sufficient to carry the story.Great performances by Gregory Peck, David Niven, and Anthony Quinn. James Darren of music and surfer movie fame does an especially good job in an action role."
5,Great WWII adventure in Hi Def,I always wanted this film and at the price of this Blu Ray it's not to be missed. Good special features too.
3,Good but it has major problems too,"Film needed more period flavor. What's with Ritchie's brother Bob's hairdo? Too 80's. Also, the film gets goofy towards the end with the Big Bopper going around saying ""Hello Baby"" to everyone and a weak performance by Marshall Crenshaw(Sp?) as Buddy Holly."
4,xxx,"I think this video is very interesting, spessially if you find that kind of music interesting.Life-storys for me are alveys interestin because then you can understand the music more."
5,La Bamba Is One Of The Best,"La Bamba will make you cry! The actors are exellent at making you think they really do care about his death, and you can't keep yourself from tapping your foot to La Bamba. So get it!"
2,Dvd was loose in the case.,"I was really excited to see that La Bamba was available on here, so I ordered it right away. I sang the songs at work everyday until my package came in. As soon as I picked it up I could hear the DVD rattling around in the case, sure enough when I opened the case it the DVD was scratched."
4,Phil Collins,A football player has sex with a woman in South America that he is supposed to be trying to retrieve for a friend that he doesn't seem to like that much. A good deal of brainwashing and objectifying of women takes place.
1,Boring - sorry i bought it.,"I missed seeing this on TV one evening, so I bought the DVD. I'm a fan of Jeff Bridges, butI can't see how this movie got any praise. Roger Ebert also liked it, in his review, though. Jeff Bridgeswas good, as usual, but otherwise, the script, and acting by the others, resulted in a tedious film, I thought. I wish I had rented it or seen it on TV instead of buying it. I won't even give my DVD to anyone as a gift."
2,Print Head Failed after some heavy use,This printer worked great for about 3 years. After printing 200 or so pages of picture indexes some of the color jets seemed to be clogged. Then it stopped printing altogether. Diagnostic light flashed amber 7 times followed by green flash = failed print head. Why can't Canon replace this part for about $10?
1,piece of junk,i did a little research before buying it but it isn't worth the money. the color prints are really average and is not really a photo printer. the text document are okay. the paper tray really [is bad]. Just don't waste your money buying this printer
5,Confirmed customer,"I received this printer in the correct delivery time. I was glad to see everything was there and I set it up easily. I use the MacOSX so the directions are not great for us. I called tech support directly with a question about having to download a driver which was not on the CD. They were super friendly and listened to my concerns. I called the following day about ink level viewing which again was unclear in their manual. Tech support was patient, caring and knew their stuff. The printer is super for its price. and I am having a ball. I am now a Canon customer for life..."
1,"Originally I loved this printer, BUT.","After 18 months fairly low-volume use at home, the printhead suddenly stopped printing black. It looks like an electronic failure in the head itself; it is not clogged, and has only been run on genuine Canon cartridges.When I bought this printer I was given to understand that the printhead was a consumable product, that it would last about 5,000 pages and that the cost would be around USD50 to replace it. Hah!. They sure were accurate about the lifetime. But the cost!. More like USD150!. This is ridiculous. I have now bought an Epson C86 and I am furious with Canon for deceiving me. I am also angry that all the environmental pollution that resulted from making this printer was in vain; its not economically repairable, so it will have to be dumped; more pollution. Canon are obviously gouging me; how could they sell the printer for the asking price if the head really cost anything like what they want for it."
3,Not the best,Was an okay story. Not as dynamic as expected. Filming seemed a bit amateurism...maybe just an old film and we expected more.
2,Not a family movie,"While the story has a strong positive moral message--one worthy of viewing by adolescents on up, I was disappointed in the amount of profanity in the dialogue. I had originally ordered several copies of the DVD to give as gifts to my late adolescent and early teen grandchildren. Upon viewing it, I returned the DVDs. The prevalent, and mostly unnecessary, inclusion of profanity, for me and my family, overrides the moral message. It's not a family movie in my book."
1,The Colt-DVD,"The Colt is a Hallmark production with a ""Not Rated"" statement;however our family was very disappointed with the number of times God's name was used in vain. This is not necessary for what could have been a wonderful movie. Not only was God's name abused, but several other vulgar words were used. It is difficult to sit and watch a movie with so much swearing in it. I was highly disappointed. The reviews were misleading and did not mention anything about language. Before we purchase a movie we depend on the reviews and went by those, trusting what they said. We were deceived. We can not return it because it was opened. So I guess we are out $8.53.We would not recommend this movie to anyone."
2,Interesting theories on life at 30 degrees Kelvin,"Forward provides interesting theories on how life could be sustained in the absence of solar energy but, I felt like I was one of the crew, entering the telebots for one boring shift after the next. Frankly, I couldn't wait for the book to end."
2,"Three good songs, the rest are crap","The Giant, Descending Winters and The Ship are great songs. If you're buying this album for those songs like I did, you shouldn't be disappointed. If you hoped to get a couple other good songs out of it, you're going to be very disappointed. This is by far STS's worst album. From beginning to end The Morning Never Came is great, Hope is alright and New Moon is fantastic but I really can't recommend this album to anyone. I only even give it 2 stars because I love The Ship so much."
3,not as good,"The morning never came was great. I PROBABLY HAD TOO HIGH OF EXPECTATIONS, but this CD does not measure up. I've tried several times to fall in love with this one but it aint happening. The songs are not near as melodic as their previous work, nor as flowing. Everytime a song seems about to reach a melodic peak they spoil it by throwing in a major 7th. Come on keep with the minor keys you can't pull off scale changes like OPETH. Worth a listen but nothing groundbreaking here."
3,not bag gloves,"Title says wraps, photo shows gloves, novice is confused. After reading the reviews I know what I bought, but would have appreciated a better description. I would've bought a more expensive item, also from Everlast, had I known these aren't actually meant for a bag.After only two days of use some of the padding is torn and the gel pad has slight damage, and this is not encouraging. They are very comfortable although not very breathable, and I can see how they could help when worn under boxing gloves. Unfortunately I don't own a set of those, and on my budget buying gloves to protect gloves is sort of silly..."
4,good gloves,"for the price , can not go with the top of the class. but good for the price. compared with top of the leather made for 25% more they work well for my son"
2,Frail,"I bought these hand wraps to use under my gloves and at first they were great, but after 2 weeks use, the knuckle area started to split and now they're kind of falling apart. Even with proper use, they aren't very durable; I don't recommend them. I think I would have been better off if I bought traditional hand wraps instead of these frail things."
5,New to kickboxing,"So I recently took up kickboxing and was a little taken aback with having to buy gloves. I didn't know what kind, or what to look for. The ones I borrowed at the gym were similar to these but had less coverage on the knuckle. I looked for the exact same thing but couldn't find anything. This item was the closest I could find. I am so glad I made the purchase as these have worked out really well. The fact that they do cover more knuckle is an added benefit. They are super comfortable on my hands and do make each punch smoother. I'm really enjoying kickboxing and using these gloves!"
2,Were great for a while...until they fell apart!,"I purchased these because they seemed like a good alternative to wrapping my hands. And they actually worked very well for a few weeks. But then, they started falling apart! The EverGel is still on the glove, but all of the black fabric has fallen of revealing a thin mesh. If you intend to use them every once in a while, they'd be fine, but I certainly can't recommend these if you intend to use them on a regular basis."
3,beware,"I have bought a pair of these. Looked just fine and felt comfortable. But be careful if you use them an a bag alone, i.e. without bag gloves. They can be easily torn. I was surprised how fast they got damaged on a light bag. Everlast website read that these gloves can be used alone on a bag. But I think it's better to use them as a hand wrap for a bag glove and not as a glove itself."
1,Useless replacement for hadwraps,"If you intend to buy them as a replacement for handwraps for doing heavy bag punching, then dont. Of course unless you want your hands to be reduced to arthritic claws. I tried to use them under protex3 everlast 16oz gloves for 80lbs bag punching. Felt sorry for buying. I give them one star as they look good and feel comfortable. May be useful during light bag punching."
1,Won't last long,I used it TWICE... and mean TWICE!!! And they fell apart. And I'm just a girl punching a bag. Do not buy these never had a pair of gloves fall apart on me that fast.
2,Teeeeny Tiny gloves,"I purchased these for my 12 year old daughter who is very small boned. She was unable to get them on her hands since they were so small - they were painful to her. I cannot comment on their utility since she was never able to use them! Tried to return, but vendor wants to subtract charges for the delivery so I'd have to pay for shipping in two directions. Decided to donate them instead. Maybe there is a 6 year old or a midget out there who could use them!"
2,STICK TO THE ORIGINAL.,"Anyone who has seen the original 1970 version with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, under the aegis of Neil Simon's tight scriptwriting, knows how an excellent cast, script, and director can put together a comedy masterpiece.By the same token, it's easy to see how the opposite of that can create another insipid Hollywood bore-a-thon! Despite two stars in the lead that I simply adore, it falls miserably on its head. There are about 2-3 actual gags that evoke so much as a grin, and out of a full length movie that just isn't enough.While I highly recommend the original, you'd probably be better off skipping this wannabe farce."
3,LIGHT AND FUNNY !,"A lot of people expressed disappointment over this film, but perhaps they were just expecting it to deliver more than it was intended to deliver! I admit, it will probably never win any awards, and maybe it's not one of the absolute BEST movies Steve Martin and Goldy Hawn have ever been involved in. NEVERTHELESS, it delivers 90 minutes of laughs and entertainment as we watch empty nesters, Harry and Nancy from Ohio,tackle the many aggravations of BIG BAD NEW YORK CITY! Their rental car breaks down, they're mugged, pursued by a vicious Rottweiler, and spied in a ""compromising position"" by the mayor, himself! Yes, the movie succumbs to extreme silliness at times; but on the plus side, it made me laugh and never got boring! John Cleese is hysterical as a mad-cap cross-dressing hotelier, preforming a high-kicking disco dance to Donna Summer's ""Bad Girls."" (This scene alone makes the movie worth seeing)!"
5,"if you think i'm scared of that little..dog, well, ha-ha!","I also like Goldie Hawn in the first wives club, but this is just about her best performance. Is it just me or when you watch this movie do you not SEE THAT Goldie Hawn has yet hit 35? And she's like 52 in this movie, she looks so good. Steve Martin...well, he's always looked around 54 or 55, even when he was in his mid 40's, he always looks older. They are so funny together, I am serious, they were so funny, this movie always cracks me up from beginning to end!"
1,Just stinking bad.,"This movie is, how shall I say, awful. Not funny at all -- and I'm pretty easy to get a laugh out of! Martin's acting, as usual, is good, but even his good acting could not trump the poor writing."
1,No words to describe this utterly terrible movie.,"Like I said, no words to describe it. All I can come up with is that it stinks. It's terrible. Steve Martin can do better than this movie. Don't waste any time to see this movie. If you want laughs see Galaxy Quest."
1,NEIL SIMON PROBABLY LEFT TOWN,"Wouldn't you with your name attached to this pathetic movie? Of course Neil Simon had very little do with this fortunately. The original movie pretty much was carried by Jack Lemmon -but it had a certain charm. While no Odd Couple - Simon with the original one - did not need to be ashamed.Very few of the jokes work in this movie. For example, the bit where they mistakenly enter a sex therapy group, starts out funny, but ends up very unfunny. This movie really proves how very difficult it is to write a good comedy. My guess is they paid big $$$ for this screen adaption - yet the results look like a quick TV Movie script.Interesting thing is to look at each scene in this movie - and try to figure out how to make it funny.Once the film company had this thing locked and ready to exhibit when it first came out, one can only think of the famous words that Bernie Shaw of CNN uttered live on an actual CNN news segment last spring: ""This is going to be a f....n disaster"""
1,Don't waste your $$ on this garbage,"Next to ""Godzilla"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" the is the worst film I have ever seen, there is nothing funny about it. Waste of Cleese and Martin."
3,I liked this film,This was a simple yet very funny film. I liked Steve Martin more then Jack Lemming was in the Original. If you like Steve Martin i recommend Bowfinger but this film also shows Goldie Hawn at her best.
5,A very good start for those that are into incense making,"I love this book. Every herb thats used in the craft today are spoken in this book. A book that takes you deeper on how herb work?, why herbs work?, why do witches use herbs?, and what can herbs do for you?. All these questions can be answer in this book. Very well worth your time."
5,never stays on my shelf,"this the book that i always use for making incense and doing spells. when ever i find some herbs,flowers,trees,or plants outside i look them up in this book. this book has alot of plants in them even the most basic one like grass which i had no idea it could be used in magick. he loves me,he loves me not is an actual form of divination used by taking the petals off a daisy. want prophetic dreams put bayleaf under your pillow. cactus are very protective plant. to bring money to you leave a jar of sesame seeds open in the house. this is an excellent book and should be on every witch's shelf"
4,herbs review,I LOOKED AT THE BOOK. ITS INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT IS USE AS MAGICAL HERBS. I ENJOYED THE BOOK.
2,Extremely limited ......Not for beginners in herbalism,"This book is only for the magical uses of herbs and is limited even on that level. It only gives uses/names for fresh herbs, nothing else. It is helpful if you wish to know the magical uses of fresh herbs but not much else. Learn more about the herbs themselves before you buy this book, otherwise it is a waste of money!"
1,its like the psychic hotline,"I hate this book. There is no practical information. Sure I may have ordered the wrong book but, even as a mythological source, it is still poor in quality. "" Magical Uses"" are so general and could apply to any situation. Its like reading your horoscope....they somehow always apply to you, in their totally generalized manner. I would return it but with the shipping costs as such, I'll trade it."
2,Once Fallen (2010) Twice Forgot,"Once Fallen (2010) is the kind of movie you'd most likely only find at a film festival in the huddled masses of other enthusiasts doing a poor job of time management and filling their schedule with copious amounts of nutrients, beverages, and screenings. You'd probably first catch Ed Harris (who needs no introduction) in the credits followed by Taraji P. Henson (Hustle & Flow, The Curious Case of Ben.Button) and Amy Madigan (Gone Baby Gone) and consider whether or not to see yet another zombie horror flick or yet another crime drama. You might stumble across the DVD at your local rental place, one copy tucked between an alien space saga and a sketchy rom-com and think to yourself, who is the writer-director behind this film?-more-At Above the Line:Practical Movie Review[...]"
1,disc is corrupt,disc is corrupt and enough to drive you crazy in the last 10 minutes of the movie.probably out of a hundred DVDs i bought from Amazon. this one will go to the trash can.
3,okay kid stuff,"yes they did that in 1963 and even before. Ray harryhausen's stop motion is a wonder in itself, but the story is strictly for kids."
3,OMG - MAKES A TOTAL JOKE OF THE JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS MYTH!,"This is cheesy, but worth a laugh. It retells the myth so poorly, with inaccurate and missing information, you gotta laugh! Great to have students compare to the real myth, and for entertainment, considering its age. It is not animated, as it might appear."
5,Great Movie,What a great classic movie! I received this order in good shape and a timely manner. I would use this company again.
2,You can never go back,"I have fond memories of this movie from childhood but upon watching it as an adult I was disappointed. Sure, Ray Harryhausen was a genius and a pioneer in the special effects department but in today's world this movie just falls flat. If you haven't seen this movie in years and would like to revisit it you probably shouldn't. It may disappoint you. You are better off getting the Harry Hamlin Clash of the Titans. It has withstood the test of time better."
5,A classic of stop animation,"If you like adventure movies like Clash of The Titans, you'll love this. It's a great adventure from beginning to end. A must have."
4,Great Game,"This game is the epitome of unecessary violence and gore. The graphics are outdated, but the gameplay is worthy of the most insane psychopaths."
4,Manhunt,Now if your into a game that's bloody and a bit demented this is your game. In this game you go around killing all sorts of gangs even NEO NAZIS!!! for some guy i haven't advanced much in the storyline but its cool pretty far.
4,kick ass,"My only real complaint here is that the replay value of the game is non existent. I mean sure it's fun to replay but it's not like you don't know what's around the corner. For that reason I won't shell out my $50.00 for it. I'll wait and get a cheap used version down the road.That said, this game kicks ass! I loved it from my first kill. No, of course it's not GTA. It's not supposed to be! But it is every bit as fun. Yes I'd buy it and love it, just not new. I think these games are way friggin overpriced!"
5,Great game!!!,"First off many people complain about the gore but I like it I think it adds to the action.It also has so many weapons its crazy from the plastic bag to the sawed off 12 gauge shotgun they are all good.The new radar system is ingenious not being able to see anyone on radar if they are not moving are talkin is great!My favorite weapon is the Hand Axe because if you hold the square button down long enough you chop their neck.The only downsides are no choice in characters, no customizable outfits,and no brass knuckles!So lets review.Pros:+ Great graphics+ Great gameplay+ Large amount of weapons+ Very fun when you get a killCons:+ Can be a bit slow at times+ No customization+ No choice in charactersThere you have it despite the bad things this is still a five star game and worth buying."
5,Rockstars Second best Game after GTA,"This game is great, got lots of violance,disturbing sounds & graphics.All those MORONS who said this game sucks don't even own the game, they rented it and after playing it for day or 2 they say it sucks. It's true you gotta hide all the time to survive, the game is called ""ManHunt"" meaning psycho killers on the loss very well armed are after you and on many occasions you don't have a weapon unless you take one away from your enemy. That's why you gotta hide, if you got 10 guys coming after you at the same time there's no way you can just fight them and survive. That just bein realistic. GTA is totaly different game and shouldnt be compared to ManHunt, in GTA you got all the weapons so of course you could come up to anyone and blow them away. This game is all about surviving in the most dangerious enviroment, and there's only one way out, going threw the enemy's turf."
1,This is so stupid,"Okay, as if we don't have enough killing games already. GTA3 VC and other games are all fine and dandy, but this is just dumb. There is no point to it. It's stupid and everything is very fake and lloks dumb. I can't believe people play this crap."
5,Great!,I can ice my cakes in record's time. I love this thing. I want one in every size now. Great buy.
3,disappointed,Good quality but did not expect the angled part near the handle to be included in the 13 inches . Too short for my specific use.
3,"Amazing "" Like Being There"" feeling to the ears as you Drive Or Spin !","Jim Meskimen ,R.F. Daley and Thomas Silcott almost completely take us back to the days of radio.Audiobooks can do a job that helps commuters and spinners embrace their moments.Head Hunters may have been in Samoa or Tonga past.Thinking when this was written and now taboos we don't cross , Fascinating tale and yet the Caucasians are villians.Loved the reference to SUB-TOMMIES, This has got to be submachine tommy guns...They sound very cool when follyed."
1,What a joke,This movie is a complete joke. It feeds you this half-baked story then at the end it throws in a bunch of plot twists that make half the movie nonsensical.I felt insulted by the writers and actors if they think this kind of crap will float with people.Maybe the worst movie I've ever endured.
1,Dudley Can't Do Right,"After I saw this movie once, I vowed never to see it again. Brendan Fraser is completely incompetent as an actor. Actually, he isn't even an actor. He's just somebody who happens to get filmed in a movie. He can't act. Will someone kindly inform he and his agent of this fact? He shows how much work the Canadian Mounties put into the job- nothing!DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!!!"
5,5 star book....however,"I believe I have read almost every golf book published. The theory and terminology of this book is both new and exciting. However, I do not understand the author's insistence on directing her book's toward women.Although ""Power Golf for women"" does address the anatomical differences that will affect a woman's swing, I believe the title of the book should have been ""Power Golf"". This book would benefit any male player and by directing it toward women the author has lost a good male audience.Ms. Horn is without a doubt the first lady of golf instruction. However if she wants to become golf's next guru she's going to have to bridge the gender gap."
4,Rare Blue Ray find,Great movie in Blue Ray Glory. Limited Edition supposedly only 3000 copies. Would have been nice if it was numbered.
2,The version I received would not play.,"This version was manufactured for the USA and Canada region. If I`d known this, I wouldn`t have bought it. I got good versions of other films before.That`s really all I have to say. filbin@eircom.net"
5,Steel Magnolias ( Special Addition),"Love, love, love, my Steel Magnolias DVD. It came in when it was supposed to and it runs perfectly. It is one of my favorite movies and I am happy to be able to get my fix for it whenever I want."
5,Love Steel Magnolias!,This cast is awesome! I love this movie! One of my favorites! Julia Robert's performance is incredible! I have seen this movie so many times I can quote it.. which is probably why I can't get anybody to watch it with me!Must have for any fan!!
1,Don't waste your money,"I have purchased this movie because I am a fan of independent German films. However, this movie was the worse German movie I have ever purchased. The movie is predictable and most of the times boring and I yawned from beginning to end. Nevertheless, the actors tried to make the best out of a terrible script. The reason I put a star was because it wont allow me to give it a zero. Don't waste your money not even for a rental."
4,A beautiful model,"A very beautiful model of a Greek temple. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the amount of time and focus it takes to build this. Not a craft to be done with small children! But if you have the patience to do it, it's worth it."
4,"I loved the swing, can't wait to see the movie!","I LOVED THE CD MAINLY FOR THE SWING MUSIC, BUT HAVE GROWN TO LIKE THE REST TOO!"
2,Just Okay,"My four year old requested this item for Christmas, which I had never heard of until then. The doll itself is cute enough, but the vocals are, well, strange. Much deeper than you'd expect from George and therefore very unpleasant. Kind of creepy, actually. This would have been perfect without the voicebox, which I guess was the motivation for my four year old, who snipped the battery pack out of George with scissors."
3,Cute Stuffed George - wish he didn't giggle,"My son got George for his second birthday from my brother. He loves him and packs him around with him. He snuggles him and even sleeps with him. BUT, he freaks out when he laughs. Like another reviewer said, his laugh isn't normal...it is weird. So, as long as he isn't laughing he is a great toy for a toddler. (Maybe my son is just a little more timid than other children...maybe not.)"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY POOR REVIEW,"This toy is surpose to be for kids 3+ and older, but in order for george the move around @ the same time he laughs is a joke. You have to touch his feet or stomach to get him going then you have to touch the right spot under his left arm to get him to move now remind you this is for a child. George has a magical spot that kids are surpose to now about, the box doesn't were to find this spot. I returned it for a full refund, this toy didn't live up to what I thought it should haveAudrey"
5,Superb,"One of the greatest movies of all time! The story is just breath taking... Love, betrayal, friendship..... Superb movie!"
2,Great film. Awful transfer!,"There is no excuse for the poor image quality and distorted sound track. Excessive noise in dark scenes was distracting to an otherwise superb film. Of the nearly 150 DVD's I have purchased from Amazon.com, this is the most disappointing. You may want to rent it before you buy."
1,What's this movie about?,"Having heard a lot about this movie, after seeing it, I utterly fail to understand what people like about it. The story: guy has a hell of a row with his wife, leaves her and his nice kids, travels the country with another wife, and finally leaves the mess around him in a spaceship. If this is what happens when aliens come down, well, let them please stay where they belong."
4,An excellent present,"I experienced this film as a young lad and am pleased to own this very good DVD reproduction. Aside from all the obvious DVD advantages, I really enjoyed the extra features on this two-disc DVD. The interviews with Spielberg and others involved in the film are pretty facinating and insightful. Of course it is the film itself that is or isn't worth owning and for the excellent performances and the interesting concepts and questions presented here, this is a film worthy of repeat viewings and a fine addition to any DVD library."
1,Terrible blu-ray!!!,Hope somebody reads this before they buy. Great movie but terrible blu-ray. Stick with the dvd instead.Close Encounters of the Third Kind [Blu-ray]
4,Hasn't Lost its Magic,"We live in an area of New Zealand which has a large rock outcropping similar to that shown early-on in the film, so wanted to view Close Encounters once again to see how close the resemblance really was. That said, we went on to get just as enchanted by our latest viewing as when the movie was first released. Definitely a classic! (And the local rock formation is really quite accurate!)"
5,One of Spielberg's Best,"Spielberg's awesome vision has finally made it to DVD and it was well worth the wait. Nice nuggets in the ""extras"" category, to be sure. But what's really gratifying, aside from the spectacular picture and sound quality, is that Spielberg chose to restore the film's original ending (without the silly boarding of the mothership). Stunning filmaking throughout."
3,Close Encounters With the Third Reich,"Entertaining and suspenseful on first viewing, a closer reading reveals the film's rather disturbing subtext, which effectively explains away what are, after all, crimes against people, as the understandable prerogatives of a Master Race: i.e. too high above us to notice our ""rights"" and stuff. Sig Heil! Mr. Spielberg?"
5,Spielberg at his best.,"Arguably the best film spielberg has made. There is a sense of genius throughout the two hours it lasts, the play of lights and brilliance extends into the realm of thought not just of the rich pictures and scenes. Excellent directorial craftsmanship. There are traces of influence. Hitchcock and Kubrick among others but the young director has taken the hints and is breaking new ground with a vengeance. A self-fulfiling prophesy, a signpost for others to see? A landmark in the history of the cinema."
3,"Rating the Blu-Ray disk, not the movie itself.","This is one of my all time favorites. My expectations were a bit high for what to expect in the Blu-Ray format here. The transfer is decent, at best. Sounds was fantastic. There was a lot of graininess in some of the low light shots.Because there are three versions of the movie on one disk, my guess is that the compression may have been a bit higher. This might explain the surprisingly low quality of the Blue-Ray version."
3,5 Star Movie + 1 Star Price = 3 Star Review,"Really, the title says it all. Close Encounters of the Third Kind is one the all-time great films and certainly deserves to be release in hi-def. However, when will the studios ""get it"" and realize that they are never going to get the consumer to move to hi-def en masse until they start offering titles at more user-friendly prices?"
1,"Instant Video version is ""TV"" screen","Be warned that if you buy the streaming video version of this movie (rent is not an option) you are not getting a film version of this movie, but the hacked up narrow screen version that is formatted for TV. It's also low resolution and essentially looks like someone recorded it off of their television on a DVD recorder 10 years ago.It's a huge ripoff and there's no excuse for amazon to be selling this version. I am very disappointed. If this is what they're selling, they should lower the price and INFORM the customer that it's not actually the ""movie"" version."
5,Read this book,Well worth the effort in trying to get this book - a very forward thinker and ideas are articulated well. The world needs more thinking like this.
3,Not quite understanding what all the fuss is about...,"I had several people recommend this book to me and was very excited to read it. I was instead disappointed by basic concepts, a grating over-sincerity, and an annoying habit of name-dropping and self promotion. I think examining our relationship to money is very important and needs to happen more in our culture, but for me ""Your Money or Your Life"" by Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin and ""Seven Stages of Money Maturity"" by George Kinder were more insightful and immediately useful. That being said, I'm glad that Lynne Twist is doing the work she is in the world and anything that brings public attention to these issues serves a purpose."
5,"Oliver Twist asks ""more""; Lynne Twist asks ""enough""!","One of the best books I've read concerning personal finances. Specifically, the book urges us to direct the flow of money in our lives -- no matter the amount -- in a manner aligned with our highest personal, and human, values. Highly recommended."
4,Good metal,"I took a chance on this from the 30 second clip. I was not disappointed. Good riffs and lyrics. Good rhythm and tempo. If you liked the older metal from the early to mid 80's, you'll like this(and I don't mean the hair metal)."
4,good old time fun metal,I like this record. Is there anything new and innovative on it ? No not really. I don't care though. I think the singer has a decent voice. I like the melodies. This album makes me feel great it really pumps me up. I reccomend it if u want an album that will make u feel good
4,Deeply Satisfying Story of Murder and Courage,"Audrey Hepburn is brilliant as the recently blinded housewife, Susie, who is home alone when Alan Arkin comes to call. He believes she has a doll which is full of heroin. The title suggests the theme: she may be at something of a disadvantage now, but wait until dark.The bad guys -- Alan Arkin is the crazy one, but Richard Crenna and Jack Weston are his unenthusiastic confederates -- create an elaborate charade to try to convince Susie that her husband is a murderer, and she must give them the doll as the only piece of evidence that connects him to the murder.Susie's smarter than the three of them put together. She has a useful ally in the little girl who lives upstairs and does errands for her, but between the two of them, they brilliantly uncover the lies and vanquish the bad guys.No, I'm not going to spoil it by telling you how. It's a four-star movie."
3,Audrey hepburn can't act,"The concept for the movie is great, ie. a blind women who has perceptions other than vision which allow her to figure out a dangerous situation. Alan Arkin is terrific. Unfortunately, Audrey Hepburn can't act. She talks like a little girl, makes inappropriate movements relative to her part as a blind person, and is simply unbelieveable. I have just seen her in Charade and she acts like Audrey Hepburn, not an actress in a role. She is pretty, petite, and elegant but not an actress. Meryl Streep or even Julia Roberts could have handled the part."
5,An unforgettable thriller,"I was very happy to find ""Wait Until Dark"" on DVD at Amazon. I saw this movie as a kid when it first was released in the theatre and I can still remember the screams from the audience in the last minutes of the film.Audrey Hepburn gives an incredible performance as a recently blinded woman who is terrorized by three men who concoct an elaborate scheme to retrieve a heroin stuffed doll they believe she has in her posession. The cast of characters is small but extremely talented and effective. Alan Arkin's performance as Audrey's tormentor is superb and their interaction brings this movie to an unforgettable climax.This is an edge of the seat, nail biting thriller suitable for teens to adult; and the perfect addition to any video library."
1,What is it with you people?,"THIS MOVIE WAS NOT SCARY, IT WAS BORING AS HELL! Sure, the performances were good, but not much else. Both my parents said that since I love scary movies, I would love this terrifying film. Boy, were they wrong! Watching this movie was about as much fun as trying to teach a man with no fingers how to light a match. If you want to see a film about a blind girl being terrorized by a psycho that is actually scary, watch Jennifer 8, but not this."
4,Not to be missed,"Still a great thriller after so many years. Alan Arkin and Hepburn are more than superb in their roles. This show just goes to prove that with a tight storyline, a spine-chilling build up and excellent actors, one does not need gore and sex to sell!"
3,Understandable....,"This movie, touches the hearts of even the people with the coldest hearts. The struggle couloured, and non-christian people had to deal with in The 60's. I think Gene Hackman is fantastic, and Dafoe is good as the stick-to-the-rule-book cop! All in all even though this film is very good, I gave it ""3 Stars"" because some aspects of the film are unbelivable, but all in all (a disturbing) but excelent movie to watch!"
1,not good,The movie I received was for the wrong region so it will not play and I didn't get it in the mail soon enough to return it so I guess I am stuck with it.
3,Fog-FULL mirror,"Solid construction, however the suction cups fall off if you touch the mirror. Very loose and hard to keep them on. Also, as other reviewers has stated, it fogged instantly. Glad I didn't pay too much for it."
5,Great movie!,This is the best movie ever. I'm married to a Red Sox fan and this is my life!Too funny!
4,"Damaged Product, Seller Remedied","This DVD could not be played without severe skipping, so I contacted the seller. They were very accommodating and gave me my money back, and they did not ask me to send back the DVD. I still need to purchase this movie, as it is a good one, but I am thankful to the seller for doing the right thing."
1,A great disappointment,"I am a Red Sox fan for 30 years and Folks, even all of you from Boston who can view this film objectively have to admit, this film is mediocre at best. The script isn't all that great and Jimmy Fallon isn't very believable as a Red Sox fan. How can he when it is a well known fact that he is a Yankees fan (talk about miscasting)? And the final scene in Busch stadium may have looked good on paper. But did anyone research this with Boston fans? Did the Farrelly bros ever put out any teasers to test the Red Sox fan base to measure how lame this film and ending really was? I saw this movie once at the theater and saw it again as a rental to see if my opinions changed over time. Contrary to popular belief, Red Sox fans do NOT like this film. OK, putting that aside for the rest of the general public, why would anyone else be interested in seeing this film if it didn't involve their team? It's not a very good film and there is only so much you can do with a mediocre script."
2,Only a movie a Red Sox fan could love,"I knew there was reason why I didn't want to see this release in the theatre and I'm not all that thrilled that I shelled out three bucks to see this as a rental. While I like baseball, I find the lacklustre romance daunting in this film. The fact that Jimmy is a diehard Sox fan is only funny for about ten minutes. So he couldn't go to a few functions and every once a while he's screaming like an idoit on t.v.--so? I kept waiting for something to happen that would either keep me in stitches or make me weep for my couple to stick it out (that's what romantic comedies do.) There was hardly enough conflict in this movie to qualify as a Lifetime movie let a lone a big theatrical movie release. And Hollywood wants to know why people are staying away from the theaters this year. Why would anyone want to spend $8-$10 for a movie when you can see better stuff on t.v.?"
5,A Fun Romantic Comedy that even a Yankees fan can enjoy...mostly,"This is a fun, enjoyable movie that absolutely captures the spirit of Red Sox nation (at least as I understand it, being a die-hard Yankee fan), and weaves it nicely into an enjoyable romantic comedy. Drew Barrymore is her usual appealing self, and Jimmy Fallon shows off some nice acting chops in a perfect vehicle for his personality. Sure, there are some unrealistic moments, and yeah, there are some artificial conflicts created to move the story along, but overall, it's a nice movie to enjoy on your own, or share with your significant other."
4,Emergency Relief supplies were well received.,I ordered a big batch of these as a Hurricane Sandy donation. Good price. Those who received them were happy they worked as required!
4,Great printer!,"I just bought this printer, and I love it. Once you go through the steps to install it on your computer, it works like a dream. Photos are awesome, particularly if they are on high gloss paper and set to ""high quality"" in the print options. Also, it is very quiet and fast. It takes literally seconds to print out a picture 8.5x11. I read that text looks a bit fuzzy, but I found it to be just fine for general printing from the Web as well. With a digital camera, there is never a need to get photos developed from a lab!"
1,Prints will fade,"Well the S900 and 9000 series of Canon printers with their speed and separate ink tanks represent a useful product design. However, any idea that the output produced is archival is a misnomer. At first I was satisfied with a fast and photo realistic print output, but then following only a matter of weeks I found my prints in the office prone to a color shift and then to fading. This is effect quite pronounced and occurs with Canon ink and Canon photo papers. So if you want archival stuff that lasts longer think again (try Epson) or if you are into prints that spend their days in the dark (album) then your probably ok. My personal feeling is this printer has to go. It just not good at making a lasting impression!"
5,s900,Just needed a print head and got a whole printer canon s900. Probably too inexpensive for supplies.Works great wish canon would make more printheads.
2,Not That Great,"I have owned my Cannon S900 for about five months. If you use the Cannon brands of paper, you will have much better results, which is probably understandable. Even with that, it makes minimally better pictures than my previously owned similar {brand} that was about five years old. If you are a person that is prone to stress, or needs the printer to perform when you click ""Print,"" this may not be the model for you. It goes on the blink with the slightest provocation. The ink wells are collectively expensive, and you have to keep back ups if you need color prints, because each runs out independently of the other. The paper feeder is tempermental. Frequently, nothing is in sinc, and it is at those times that I tell my husband that I'd rather have a root canal than own this Cannon C900."
5,Great Printer,Great speed and Quality photos. I use a Olympus C-3040 and Photoshop 6. I have two HP Inkjets and have looked at other printers. I have not found any printer that matches the quality of my new Canon S900.
2,very unhappy,You should have record that I have reviewed this product before. NOT HAPPY. Ended up buying 2 bottle thankfully I could use one of them. The other I had to throw away which I found out was a mistake. The other company gave me a 20% refund for a product I could not use.
1,disappointed,"A very basic phone with not one good ringtone, display or wallpaper. Did not recieve the USB cable. I am going back to the Nokia 6102i."
3,"Not a good copy of ""braveheart""","I like Tom Cruise, but I was kind of disappointed. It's an entertaining movie, but don't try to compare it to classical ones (7 Samurais, braveheart...). The story is unrealistic and box office oriented. Good job in cinematography and fight scenes."
1,Ugh...,"On the plus side.. nice scenery, epecially in the Kyoto Castles where ordinary tourists are not allowed to take pictures. But the rest..History as written by white boys. Despite claims that this movie is about an historic time as seen by a character.. it's just another fluffy, cotton-candy Hollywood star vehicle. Tom Cruise plays an 1860's disillusioned caucasian who goes to Japan to train the emperor's new, ""modern"" troops. Instead, he is wounded and captured by the Samurai. He learns Japanese language and customs, masters Bushido and wins the love of the wife of A GUY HE KILLED.. all in the amazing time of 6 months! As only a white guy can! Then, he actually WEARS the armor of the guy he killed to ride next to the Samurai lord in a final battle for honor. Ya gotta wonder what actual Japanese people thought about this."
5,When should Tom Cruise get an Oscar nomination and wins it ?,"When should Tom Cruise get an Oscar nomination and wins it ? I'm not a serious Cruise's fan, but I like his work and he works hard for his roles as many A-list actors do. Again, he should be nominated for best actor Oscar for his role in the Last Samurai. It has some of the modern themes of regional and globalsuperpowers dominations and attemp to change the inner cultures of other nations for the sake of self-centered interests and for the love of control. You'll find those elements somtimes hidden within the storytelling. The battle sequences are very wellperformed yet they need to be longer in duration. The movie is visually stunning.It is a very good movie to watch, and certainly one of the 2003best movies."
1,simply doesn't play on any device,"It says that the region is not supported, its a region 1, which is correct but doesn't work. Would appreciate the owner sending a working copy. Thnks"
2,poor quality,"The quality of the DVD was disappointing. It stopped many time through out the movie, we finally gave up and sent it back (we did play another DVD to make sure that was not our machine's problem)."
5,Le meilleur de Tom Cruise,"Ce film est de loin le meilleur de Tom Cruise. Il incarne son personnage avec beaucoup de conviction. Je n'avais jamais vu cet acteur sous ce point de vue. L'histoire est bonne et poignante. Un ""must have"" pour tout amateur de samuras et d'histoire."
5,Awesomeeeeeeeeeee!!,"Just a really well done movie. This has it all: an epic scale, a love story, outstanding soundtrack, and fight scenes. Plain greatness."
5,perfect purchase,Movie was easy to find online. It arrived as promised and I'm happy with the order and the way it was processed. I'll order from this company again.
4,BluRay The Last Samurai,Received shipment sooner than the anticipated timeline provided. Arrived in excellent condition and the quality was fantastic.
4,One of cruises better movies.,Don't like tom cruise that well but this movie I enjoyed. Liked the story line and scenery. Other actors were greatand helped carry the movie along.
4,DANCES WITH WOLVES IN JAPAN,"Tom C's best movie - I am not a big Tom C. fan but this is his best movie. Good pace, good acting, great soundtrack it has it all -"
4,Excellent Movie,"Tom Cruise plays the role of Captain Nathan Algren, an American soldier who has become disillusioned with his life (he starts to regret the fact that the only thing he is good at seems to be killing). He reluctantly accepts a position to train an army of Japanese transcripts to use Western fighting techniques to combat the Samurai. He is ultimately captured by the Samurai, who need him as a source of information about their enemy.As a captive of the Samurai, Nathan learns the ways of the Samurai and their people, and eventually learns to respect their philosophy about honor and service."
4,Good movie,"This is a pretty enjoyable movie with a good amount of Japanese history in it. It's not entirely accurate, but it is still a good film nonetheless, and Tom Cruise does a good job in his role. The setting of Japan is also done well as well as its Westernization as Japanese citizens either embrace it or fight against it. Overall a good historical film."
5,extremely under-rated... somewhat violent,"A very well crafted movie, with so many parallels to the spiritual life, especially the priesthood. I was particularly struck by its romantic view of an idealized lost culture, juxtaposed against modern industry and greedy politicians, which served as a warning against the dangers of Utilitarianism (which pope John Paul II spent so much time speaking out against in his writings)."
4,The Last Samurai,Excellent depiction of Japanese culture and the conflict between traditional and modern forces. Great movie.
4,Entertaining and Informative,"Lots of action and a gripping plot made this movie seem shorter than it's actual run time of 2 1/2 hours. As usual, Amazon was speedy with their delivery."
1,NOT 1080P only 480P,It is a wonder why I needed another 480P version of this movie. When you purchase 'blueray' you may think at least 780P but not with this one. I guess I should have been more careful but with all the hype I assumed the movie would be in a higher def.
2,poor sound,i have last samurai HD DVD and BLU-ray..the HD has a poor sound but the BLU-ray has a great sound...the picture quality is the same for Blu-ray and HD DVD and there`s no much diffrent from regular DVD
5,The Last samurai,I watched the movie Last samurai.This movie is about few samurai and an american fight the new japanesegovernment.I thought the show was very cool and very excited movie.I would recommend this show Last samurai because I watched very interesting.
5,The Last Samurai,"This movie is about ""SAMURAI SPIRITS"".Tom Cruise trains japanese people tobecome worriors to fight the enemy.I like the story because I want to be acool man just like SAMURAI in this movie.I recommend the movie because thestory is excerent."
2,better left to others......,"I lived in Japan for several years and spent allot of time going to Japanese cinema which was full of samaurai epics so I was interested in this film....I want to it reluctantly tho becauseI am NOT a Cruise fan.Basically he portrays himself in every film he does. Gee, maybe that is why he has never won an academy award.....has he ever been nominated? I don't think so.......The only redeeming part of this film was the story, the wonderful scenery, and the supporting cast. I frankly would have loved to have seen more of them and allot less of him......unfortunately this particular film did not develop their character as much as ""Dances With Wolves"" developed the Sioux characters.The Meiji period was an interesting time for Japan and this could have been much better."
2,Dances with Samurais,"Edward Zwick delivers us a regurgitated version of ""Dances With Wolves"" only this time with Japanese culture instead of Indians. The story line is very much like ""Dances With Wolves"" in the way that Tom Cruise makes a transformation from a ""Bad Guy"" in the beginning and becomes a ""Good Guy"" later on in the film as he joins up with the loyal Japanese samurai soldiers.The direction is poetic and confident. Cruise is serviceable, but not memorable. The real steal in the film is the acting by Ken Watanabe. His character really moves and enlightens you. There's an effortless grace that he posesses.I would recommend this film to anyone who likes sweeping epic dramas."
5,Thank you Amazon,"I owned this movie before & it was stolen from my house. I was determined that I would not buy it again, but it was such a good movie I had to give in. The real reason for this review is the fast dependable service provided by Amazon. I ordered this movie & had it in my mailbox two days later. Thank you Amazon, you never let me down."
3,Beautifully filmed - lame story,"""The Last Samurai"" is the same story as ""Dances with Wolves"" - bitter Civil War vet goes off to a far away land and encounters a group of people looked down upon by Western Civ as ""savages"" but are instead a poetic and noble culture. The idea is nice, but overly simplifies feudal Japan, which wasn't exactly a peaceful and idyllic place all of the time.The acting is good, the story is OK, but the ending is downright silly and unnecessary. I won't spoil it for those that haven't yet seen the movie, but let's just say that the ""true"" ending would've involved Tom Cruise meeting a noble death on the battlefield. Instead, he lives happily ever after, which was not the message of the rest of the movie."
1,No research whatsoever,"Decent acting, decent actors, terrible writting, no research into Japanese customs whatsoever, almost as insulting as ""Rising Sun."" Waste of over two hours."
5,The best movie ever made and should easily win the oscar,"This movie was very very good. I did not think tom was a great person for the part, but when i saw it, he did fantastic. This movie is easily one of the best films ever made. One thing is that the movie keeps people interested. The characters are ones in which you fall in love with and the entire story does not get boring, non like master and commander which is so boring that nothing keeps u interested. This movie should win the oscar awars easily becuase it is the best movie made."
2,"Pretty Good Movie, but...","i may pick this film, but I think that certain things take away from the overall story. first, i think it would have been better completely without Tom Cruise's character. Just Ken Watanabe's character. Secondly, there was this one part where you watch Tom Cruise fight some guys, then directly after, you have to watch it over again. it was supposed to add dramatic effect, but i hated it. i already saw it once, why do i have to see it again? finally, the ending sucked. it was just Tom Cruise acting like he was an angry drunk and it didn't make any sense why he didn't die. Ken Watanabe's character was actually cool, why did he die and Tom Cruise live? other than that, it was a pretty good film."
3,"Good Movie, Blu ray suspect","I am not here to write about the movie... it's a good flick and worth owning. However, the blu ray version would not play on my BD30K machine with the latest updates.Not sure if it's the anti-copy protection or the poor implementation of blu ray from Sony. Either way I can't watch it."
5,Far more then I expected.,"After reading some of the reviews here, I was not expecting too much from this movie, but thought I would give it a try anyway.I was truly surprised, it was VERY well done, the acting and story line were far more solid then I had expected. This movie delievered far more then I expected.So all I really have to say, is give this movie a try, I doubt you will be disapointed."
3,good buy for horror fans,"This promising Dario Argento/George Romero effort had all the potential to be a masterpiece, but somehow the episode directed by Romero (The Facts in the Case of Mr. Waldemar) turned out to be a terrible misfire, baddly acted and baddly written, and unfortunatelly weakened the movie as a whole.However, Dario Argento's The Black Cat is able to make you watch it on the edge of your seat, a gut-wrenching horror episode wonderfully enacted by the always great Harvey Keitel.The Blak Cat is brought to life thanks to Argento's talent, who knows like no one else the right way to move his cameras, bringing to the screens an original and classy art, and how to add sharp tension and suspense to his pictures. Although very short, The Black Cat is reminiscent of Dario's masterpiece Deep Red. In conclusion, Two Evil Eyes is a good buy for horror fans, because even with the boring episode by George Romero, Argento's work saved the picture."
1,Enjoy it while it's working...,"Prints beautiful, excellent quality, replacement ink tanks can be found for a fair price...some high gloss papers don't work well with this one, find one that does and stick with it for great prints. Error messages can be annoying.Just be aware...as with many previous Canon printers you are normally replacing the ink tank only when you run out of ink...not the ink with the print head combined on the cartridge like an HP printer. Less costly, because you only replace the color you need from the 6 separate tanks...BUT print heads wear out from use, they clog if they're not used...the printhead is easily replaced on this one... but is almost impossible to find, and about $100.00 or more if you do. This leaves you with a nice looking doorstop...or you can pack it away and wait for 5 years until maybe the print head comes down in price."
4,Good Printer w/ the right paper,"At first I was taken aback by the output quality of this printer. It had been described in the press as being the best but was borderline horrible and much worse than my old Epson 740 inkjet. Tons of pixelation and overall poor quality. That was with kodak and epson paper. I bought canon paper and the output became very impressive. The speed isn't good, but with the right paper the output is nice and the ink is cheap and longlasting. Still I don't think the output quality is much better than my Epson C60. Overall a solid buy with the current discounts."
3,A Disappointment!,"I purchased this printer on Amazon just a little over 2 years ago. After suddenly having printing problems, I discovered I needed a new printhead. Well, that's no problem, so I thought. I looked up replacements and it was a shock to my system to find out that the price for a new printhead was more than twice what I paid for the printer. Needless to say, it is now in the trash. I will say, however, that during the time that it worked, it was a great little machine. Would I buy this model again? NO! I would'nt recommend it unless you have a pocketful of cash for frequent replacements. I don't print that much and don't even use it for photo prints. I do like Canon, tho'. But I'll be doing my research for the next purchase."
3,I like it less after a couple of months of use,"We've had this since Christmas and I loved it at first. It seems to be of a much better quality than those I've seen for around $10 elsewhere - the frame is made of a sturdy metal. My major complaint is that the fabric seat keeps coming off of the frame, so the doll is left falling out of her seat and I am fixing it for my daughter several times a day. I would love this toy if the fabric was better secured to the frame. My second complaint is that the stroller doesn't look like the picture online. Rather than a light turquoise, it came as in a blue gingham print on a navy frame. We still would have bought it because it is the only one I've been able to find in a gender neutral fabric, but since we cannot inspect a product that is purchased online, I think it is important that the photo be an accurate representation of the product."
5,awesome doll stroller,My 15-month old nephew loves this stroller. He pushes around various stuffed animals and a baby doll. So glad it came in blue. Best gift he got this year!
1,never received magazine,ordered the magazine before christmas. reported that i have still not received the issue to amazon on 2/25/11. havent received any response from the company.

4,Saucony Triumph 4 Running Shoes,I've been wearing Saucony running shoes since the 80s and they have never let me down yet. I recommend using cushioning as the most important factor in a running shoe and the Triumphs don't disapoint. They only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars was it was a little more than I like to spend on shoes; these were around $80 - $90.
5,I love these shoes.,"I bought these because I have a pair of Triumph 3's and I needed some new running shoes.I've been wearing Saucony for a long time (10+ years) and I think they make some of the best running shoes on the market.If you are a runner, give them a try. I did and have gone back again and again.The Triumph 4's are excellent. I am very happy with my purchase."
4,A wonderful little book,"The wife and I bought book one and two, and have found them to be a wonderful read at the end of most every day. We also sent it as a gift to a relative in prison, and he has really enjoyed them as well. Artfully bound, it is the kind of informative study material you can read and discuss over and over. Hank's best work I think."
5,Love it!,Questions are pertinent and Hank's answsers are specific and I have used this book a lot as a reference point. Excellent.
1,FAKE Les Paul,"I recieved the guitar after waiting over two weeks for it. As soon as I opened the box I knew I had been ripped off. If you do some research you will find that there are several fake Epiphone Zakk Wylde Les Pauls being sold on the internet and it just so happened that I recieved one. The pickups sounded like crap, the volume knobs didn't work properly, there were flaws in the finish and there were several epiphone emblems that gave it away as a fake.I was able to return the guitar for a refund, luckily. I would be very careful about buying another one online, especially at a reduced price and without photos being sent from the person/dealer you are buying it from."
3,"not a classic, but a fun film","Michael Caine and Sean Connery are superb. They go from one misfortune to another in this adventure and the actors play off one another great as they try to succeed in getting the loot. Although this film is not what I would call a classic, its really fun and the cinematography is well shot. I reccommend this film."
3,"It's okay, but not my favorite film.","I don't like films about criminals. Especially when they're seeking and obtain positions of power. There's nothing that disgusts me more, but here's a film about just that.I don't have too much to say about it, other than it's well acted and well shot, but this Kipling tale is more about how opportunists with no morals about their objective create mayhem, and eventually ascertain their goals.To me that's bothersome.It's worth a night's rental, or worth seeing on a rainy Sunday afternoon when there's nothing else on. It's not a film that I'd readily recommend, but it does pass the time in a masculine sort of way."
2,what a shame!,"This release, from reading previous reviews, is apparently the same as the previous dvd. It's a flipper & edited. The final scene, heavily so. The disc itself is blank, only the dreaded info that material was on each side.I have this on Laserdisc, so only one flip on this dvd & a better picture, but the Laserdisc has the whole film.I can only hope for a Blu-Ray in the near future, that has the whole movie."
2,The Man Who Would Be King,"The movie itself gets a 5-star rating as one of the great adventures in film history. John Huston, after a faltering period in his long directing career, regained peak form late in his career with this, one of his most notable and memorable works.In contrast, the DVD barely gets a 1-star rating. It is unbelievable that Warners is still selling this long-toothed, single-layered, minimal-extras, side-flipping 11-year-old edition that should have been withdrawn 10 YEARS AGO!The movie, and we consumers, deserve far better than this. Come on, guys at Warners, set things right and bring out the DVD edition (yes, DVD -- along with Blue-ray) this movie sorely warrants!"
5,The Man Who Would Be King,"Sean Connery and Michael Caine are an excellent acting match in this Rudyard Kipling epic spectacle, with humor, excitement and a surprising plot, of two British Empire retired Sergeants and rascals. Very enjoyable, recommend highly."
1,Great movie; abysmal rendition,"This is the next in line of 11 reviews to have awarded this particular DVD a single star. Being #12, I see no need to rehash the details except to accept the supplier's affirmation that it is not a pirated edition straight out of Taipei in a pretty (and misleading) package. DO check out the other one-star reviews before considering this, and caveat emptor. ...Pity, because the flick is a true classic."
1,A Terrible film!,"This is a terrible movie! I can't believe that a director as respectable as the great John Huston would make something this ridiculous. This film is the epitomy of the idea of ""The White Man's Burden."" This film shows Eastern cultures to be cruel, uncivilized, and lack intelligence. I went into this film thinking it would be a great adventure. Instead, at the end I felt like vomiting! Being an Indian and an American; I felt very offended that they were basically glorifying Alexander the ""Tyrant"" as a ""god."" I fail to understand why a man like Rudyard Kipling is considered a great writer. I wish I could give this NO STARS. John, I'll pretend you never made this film."
1,stupid,"here you have one of the greatest movies ever made, a wonderful tory, you set the dvd into the machine and, amazingly, without any packaging warning, you have to flip the dvd to watch it in its entirety. why time warner continues to distribute so many of these flaws dvd products is beyond me but i strongly recommend no one buy these screwed up products until they correct the problem by re-releasing the dvd on a one-sided version. just plain stupid."
2,Poor Sound Quality,The only negative thing that I have to say about this item was the extremely poor sound quality. The TV volume was at its max and we could just hear the movie. I wish that I had complained a lot earlier and had sent it back for a replacement. It really is a great movie.
4,A classic that cannot be forgotten,"This is a great return to old fashioned, sweeping, ribald, humor + adventure that really hasn't been seen since the mid to late seventies. A cockney swager permeates this old skool buddy story about two Brit soldiers stamping into the mountains of India to find their fortune. A highlight of Connery's career, I can't believe I hadn't heard more about this film before I saw it for the first time recently. The DVD is great, offering widescreen, a trailer, a making-of special, and production notes(hard to read). At 13.99, you cant pass this up. If you like adventure at all, this movie will do you justice."
4,Great movie! Too bad you have to flip the DVD.,"When I bought my DVD player The Man Who Would be King was one of the first movies I got on DVD even though I already have it on VHS. I was really disapointed to find that I had to flip the disk over mid-movie. It's not that long a movie, it should all be on one side. I think the VHS version is better for that reason. Perhaps later versions of the DVD are single sided, I got mine in November '98."
5,captivating mystery,"I had never heard of this book or this author until 2 years ago. I learned of it thru a book site I belong to. The book is true mystery!I advise giving it 50 pages to get into it,but it is a compelling mystery that will pull you in,twist you around and bring you out at the end exhausted and exhilarated at the same time.I have bought more of Mr. Collins books and plan to read all of his works!I found the ""female"" issues tough to get through,but the story was written in mid 1800's.Excellent writing,excellent story.A very good read to hunker down with!"
4,good serious sam set,"this purchase was well worth it. serious sam is a good game with many likenesses to the doom series, just less serious. graphics are first rate."
4,one of the berrer shooters,"I just got a new XP machine & my old DOS shooters, like Doom, don't work well on it (if anyone knows how to get such game working, please try to contact me)I even had trouble with Sam crashing until I ran it on it's safe mode. It even has simple cheat codes."
3,DVD is good,"The DVD release of this mediocre sequel to THE GUNS OF NAVARONE is of good quality. One side offers the 126 minute TV edited, letterbox edition of the film with 8 minutes of footage missing from the original. However, a few brief portions of scenes, music and dialog were deleted for TV viewing and not included in the longer side of the DVD. It's worth it for the added footage, however. The other side offers the 118 minute, full screen version. The picture quality is of somewhat lower quality than the 126 minute version. The sound quality is average quality -- 2.0. One can also a view a full screen and (and unrestored) theatrical trailer. All in all an average DVD put out a low price by MGM"
3,Great Theme Music,"The best thing that can be said for this movie is it has great theme music. Edward Fox is great in the role originally created by David Niven. His performance is more puckish than Niven's. Robert Shaw gives a solid performance. The rest of the movie is mediocre at best and often ridiculous. Watch it on TV, don't pay for it."
3,"Okay, But Lame Follow-Up","Never, *ever* watch this film right after watching ""Guns Of Navarone"" one of the greatest war films of all time, which not only had superb action but also boasted a literate script and outstanding character depth. Not so ""Force 10"" which took so long to become a film after first being proposed in the late 1960s, that by the time all the money was in place David Niven and Gregory Peck couldn't play war heroes anymore at their ages. And so, we get Robert Shaw and Edward Fox in the old Peck and Niven roles, and the contrasts are really jarring (Mallory now being British, and he's suddenly forgotten how to speak German). Taken on it's own, ""Force 10"" works as a lighthearted escapist romp and can be an entertaining diversion, but the shadow of it's magnificent predecessor just hangs over the proceedings too much (opening the film with the climax of ""Guns"" doesn't help either.)"
2,"Too many people, too few dolphins","This is another instance of an Imax film that doesn't transfer well to other media. Shots that may seem awesome on an 8 story screen look pretty routine on a widescreen TV. The documentary is only 40 minutes long or less than you can see every week on PBS Nature, Animal Planet, Discovery, etc. every week and the material is no better. The film spends far too much time showing people and far too little showing dolphins. It isn't worth buying as you won't watch it more than once."
1,Does it really matter if it's high resolution picture yadda?,"Like virtually all IMAX movies; a bloody bore and fit for audiences who simply love to go home and throw something on their big wide screen tv that they don't have to think about, by gosh by golly!"
2,What is it good for?,"Although the phone is sleek/slim, it is too long and too wide. Its too big to fit comfortably in a pocket. As others have noted, the battery life is very poor. Motorola needs to learn something from Nokia. I'm sending this back to Cingular and getting a Nokia."
4,"Swiss Army ""Pocket Pal""","Great knife. Small enough to be unobtrusive in the pocket, yet large enough to handle tougher(ish) jobs. I use mine at work to open boxes in lieu of a box-cutter and it's perfect for things like that. The only drawback to it is I would have liked a can/bottle opener, but you can get the ""Bantam"" if that's what you're looking for. I just liked the design of the Pocket Pal better, it was a little sleeker and I HATE that stupid keyring that Victorinox puts on most of their knives. Who's going to put a three inch long knife on a keyring? But I digress. Pick up a Pocket Pal, you won't be disappointed."
4,perfect for cub scout,Got several of these for our cub scout Bears and they are perfect. 2 blades is all they need. Just gotta watch out they are exremely sharp
5,Poetry in Motion,"I found Wayne Brouwer's brief reflections on each of the 150 Psalms to be right on target and very inspiring. I don't know where he gets all his stories, but they fit! This is a great book for readers of all ages!"
4,Canon D1250U2F scanner,"I read some reviews about this scanner and I was worried that it may not be very good.I bought it any way and boy was I surprised.It was easy to load the software , it took very little to set it up.I have scanned pictures, a news columns and several letter to forward, with added comments.The picture quality is not the best but it is good, the colors are just a little darker than the orignal.I am still learning to do much more with it, getting started was very easy.I have no regrets about buying this scanner"
5,Like I Was Young Again!,"Listening to this CD just takes me back to clubs in New York during the late 70's. Real honest musicians, at their best! Saw Kenny many times back then, at the Bottom Line, My Fathers Place, The Other (Bitter) End. He is as good here as ever. This is a great set of what Kenny does best. I highly recommendthis CD to both old & new fan alike."
2,Where's The GOLD?????????,"Hey guyz, I don't know whats going on here. But I bought this CD NEW & Sealed and it is not a GOLD Disc? It says it is on the box. But it ain't!!!! Still a good CD. Super Bit Mapping. :-/"
4,Great first half,"The first 8 songs are fantastic, number 9 is OK, then it's way downhill fast. I don't think I'd heard most of these last songs before, and now I know why."
2,Stick with the re-make,"Everyone knows about The Ring, but few in america has had the privelege of viewing the japanese one.Well they weren't really missing anything. I couldn't stop laughing at all the cheeziness, and fakeness of this movie. I was cracking uo the entire time. Even the psychological horror in the film was laughable. This is just not at the same caliber as the re-make, and as rare as this is the re-make surpases the original. This one is boring, fake, and humorous. To call this the scariest movie ever, you'd have to be a 3 year old kid who hasn't seen any movie yet. Other than that the only thing this film accomplishes is putting it's viewer to sleep."
5,Wrong Point of View,"My personal opinion is that people who say that the American version is worse because they use eye candy and special effects to scare us with only some jumps but no actually creepy parts definitely did not see both movies with the mindset of seeing two different movies. You have to realize that what scares Americans is completely different from what scares people of any other culture in the world...every culture has a different opinion when it comes to fear. Unfortunately, not everyone can freely watch two movies in different languages that have a similar plot but different methods of scaring and like the both of them. Unfortunately, Ringu and The Ring cannot be compared because they were both influenced by their country."
3,My god,"I haven't even seen the American version yet, just this one. Yes, it's not the most ""produced"" movie, but it is a bit terrifying.I'll skip a movie synopsis, you can read that in another review. What I will say is visually this movie is quite unique. The camera angles used are genius. I've rarely seen such things in film. A mere camera shot can produce such fear, such a rare thing. The colors are a little odd too, very creepy.I was pretty impressed with it. The one scene alone, ""comes out of the TV""... was probably the most scary thing I've ever seen. Worth the price of the DVD alone. Man, the eyes! Her eyes! Ack!"
4,A Ground Breaker,"How is it that Asian cinema accomplishes so much with so little? Having seen The Ring at the cinema it was hard for me to understand this one but, watching it again (and again) I come to realise that this is an altogether different film. As with most Asian films I watch, it relies on the stuff that made Hollywood great - good script, good direction, good acting, so on.Creepy and atmospheric, there is a real story to this one.Check it out."
3,What's the big deal,"I have never seen ""The Ring"", but after seeing a screening of Dark Water, due to come out in early 2005, I wanted to see what these Japanese horror stories are all about.I have to say I wasn't impressed. Ringu offered few scares and I thought the ending sucked and was not scary at all.I might rent ""The Ring"", hoping it will be scarier. I don't need special effects to be scared, but this had nothing. The video was weak, and I don't think all this hype is doing any favors. I was expecting scary and I got nothing.Mark"
2,Not that great,"The Karate Kid part 3 fails on many levels. The first movie had an innocence to it. Ater that movie, the innocence was lost. Ralph Macchio looks too old for this film. He's a talented actor but when you're 30 something , there's only so much that make-up can hide. The obsession that the old sensai from Karate Kid part 1 and the millionaire had with Daniel's title was disturbing. I also doubt that he went to Vietnam because he looked like he was in his late 20's. They should have switched roles...the milloinaire could pass for the karate kid and Ralph Macchio (with a little makeup) could have passed for a middle aged Vietnam vet.The plot is predictable as well...if you're paying attention, you'll have an idea of what's going to happen. I'd take a pass on buying this film. The Karate Kid part 1 is much more worthwhile. It's simple, poetic, and inspiring."
2,Watchable if you turn off your brain,"The Cobra Kai master John Kreese (Martin Kove) wants revenge on Daniel (Ralph Macchio) and Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita). So he comes up with a ridiculous scheme with his Cobra Kai buddy Terry Silver (Thomas Ian Griffith) to separate Daniel from Mr. Miyagi's teachings. While the 2 buddies hire Mike Barnes (Sean Kanan) to take the title from Danial.The plot is just cartoonish and the film doesn't have the charm and beauty of the first film. While if you saw one Karate Kid movie you've seen them all, that even goes for the remake. However the movie is mildly entertaining if you turn off your brain and don't take the movie seriously. The one thing I always liked about this silly 3rd film is that Griffith and Kove are actually fun together despite giving over the top performances."
2,Cheesey,"If you really loved KK1 and KK2, you might like this one. If you didn't like them all that much, you will be horrified by this one.Look, I can accept a few cheesey lines and some over-acting, but the whole thing was a little lame. Some loser-looking multi-billionaire who was in vietnam spends ALL of his time with his seemingly love interest buddy Reese harass some kid (Daniel) just because he wants to sign up more karate students? And they're over-the-top insane with it to the point of hysterical laughing, etc. And kata wins the tournament? Sheesh.And I didn't understand the girl's part in the story. Not a love interest, not really involved with him at all.On the plus side, it managed to keep my interest for the whole movie. Not because i loved it, but because it was okay and I loved the first one. Thought I'd see how it would end.So bizarre they went from an interesting (and far more complex) storyline in the 2nd movie to this one."
3,Just starting lets see what happens,"Having lost 30 lbs on my own by healthy food choices & up to 2 hours in the gym a day 5-6 days a week, due to life changes I have started to slip & have put back on some of my weight. I tried this because I can NOT stand or tolerate the jitters other products cause. I am borderline hypothyroid so weight lost is difficult regardless. I have noticed just in the couple of days of taking it I am not craving the carbs I usually do during my PMS week (which usually sabotages anything I may have accomplished in that month. As far as the reviews about the gas, I have that anyway due gallbladder surgery so no worries there, in fact I almost think the combination of metamucil and this product has reduced my gas. I have noticed I dont have the HUNGRIES as bad either. I am going continue with this product, not expecting a miracle but a little help."
1,Does absolutely nothing,"I exercise daily, and I finished the entire bottle. I saw no change in my weight fluctuations. My bodyweight was basically reacting the same as it did before I took these. It seems the mode of action of these pills is to block a type of amylase which breaks down carbohydrates. Well, your body can produce more than one type of enzyme to break them down. Another thing to note here is the fact that all the 5 star reviews are people who have only reviewed THIS item, which makes me question either the integrity of the seller and/or the manufacturer of this product."
2,"Probably works, but had to stop taking due to crazy gas!","I wish I was someone who could tolerate this, as I've heard good things about results using Natrol Carb Intercept. However, this gave me the worst case of gas ever. I had that gurgling, uncomfortable internal distress. My tummy felt bad. My guts were in turmoil. And thank God it was during the night--ALL NIGHT--or I wouldn't have had the nerve to step outside my door with that much gas rolling around and erupting.I tried it again, just in case it wasn't the Natrol and was something else. Eating different foods--same result. Gasorama.Bummer."
3,The jury is still out...,"I've been using this product a week now 1 to 2 times per day. I haven't seen much change, but then I haven't had any adverse effects either. I think I feel a little more spry, but I work out 5-6 days a week already and just wanted to see if there was something that might help me over that 'last 10 pnds' hump and seems more like a mountain at the age of 47. If I see if big changes, I'll post again."
2,no noticable change...but i take it anyway,"no change in weight loss, but i take it anyway. heard it can screw up your intestinal tract in the long term. oh well."
3,funny movie,"I would never put this film among my favorite films, but it is genuily funny. It will not leave you disapointed."
3,"Picture is great, sound not so.",They remastered the picture and it looks great. The sound is not improved. Oingo Boingo sounds like it's coming out of an old AM radio. I wish the sound had been redone better.
4,Rodney's Best,"The is Rodney Dangerfield's best movie. Sam Kinison was great as the History professor. As with most of Rodney's movies, it is mainly a showcase for Rodney's one-liners, but in this case I thought the plot was fairly interesting. Of course this movie could not be consider a great movie, but it was funny and enjoyable for someone who just wants to have a good time."
4,The Nelson Eddy of Concert and Opera,"I prepared this monograph to document the opera and concert work of Nelson Eddy who is often more remembered from his short but wildly successful movie career. There is a short biography and information about his family and his musical training, but most of the report is of his appearances in opera and concert from the beginning of his career and the reviews which followed each. this information gives you a good picture of the popularity and charm as well as tremendous ability of the man.AnitaD.

5,Too cute,Purchased this for a friend with a baby mule on the way. Very vibrant and clear. Will look fantastic on the stable door.
3,good for beginner,"If you know very very little thing about fusion, yes the book is for you.only the superficial informations are held in the book.I do not think that the book help you developing in glass fusing."
5,A BIG help,A really good book full of tips and how to's! I use it for reference all the time and share all the tips it has to offer
5,Meticulously detailed! Inspirational,"This book has created its own ""genre"". Intensive crime scene analysis coupled with a superior plot and all too human characters place this novel in a league of its own. It has served to educate on the precise workings of the analysts within the Police departments and the utilisation of state-of-the art technology in the fight against crime. Lincoln Rhyme, as one of the main characters and a quadriplegic, inspires by his encyclopedic knowledge, and educates us on the challenges of such a condition. His relationship with Amelia Sachs, his protege, is one of the highlights in this extraordinary novel."
1,Good idea for a plot but far too gruesome.,"I normally read the thriller type book but after reading half of this book, I just could not read another page and didn't want anyone else I knew to read it either so I threw it in the trash! The plot line was good, but the continual use of gruesome details was just too much."
2,Average but readable thriller.,"What bothered me most about THE BONE COLLECTOR was the fact that several aspects of the story were painfully familiar. The killer plants a red herring of a clue that is straight out of the film SEVEN, and other scenes are remniscent of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. The constant textbook elaboration could have been written differently as well. Maybe a good read if you're hooked on this type of genre, but I was hoping for something more original."
4,bone-chilling!!,"This read wasn't disappointing! The thriller is as fast-paced as the Collector described in it and offers somewhat of a challenge to the mind thanks to the elaborate descriptions of forensic methods and tools. The focus is on the crimes and on the psyche of the killer, but a bit of subdued romantic tension is blended in, adding a little 'pique' to the story. Very gripping up to the last twentysome pages, where the surprising finale somewhat disappoints in that it is a bit far-fetched. But nevermind, it's a worthwhile read anyway!!"
4,Chilling,"I haven't even finished this book and can't wait to purchase all his others. I read for entertainment, not for literary merit. This book is great so far and gets better with each page. The main character is a quad criminologist. Certainly a twist from other serial killer books I have read."
2,"Good read, but unbelievable ending","I loved Maiden's Grave and have read and enjoyed his short stories as well. In his other works that I have read, I frequently thought I had found plot holes, only to to have the holes cleverly filled in later. No such luck here. I found the ending implausable at best. I'm hoping the follow-up will get back into the realm of believability."
3,"Nearly 5 stars, then the ending comes","This novel is mesmerizing, exciting, and unputdownable. The book absolutely falls apart in the final pages, though, which lowers it to the rank of mediocre."
5,Non Stop Thriller,"Jeffery Deaver has done it again. Once you start reading ""The Bone Collector"",it becomes impossible to put down. Lincoln Rhyme is a great character. Mr. Deaver does a brilliant job creating this character. Great forensic details. This is a nonstop thrill ride. Keeps you guessing up to the last page with exciting plot surprises."
2,Condition,The description of the condition of the book was accurate. I didn't realize that it was mailing from outside the United States. Was anxious to get the book and it took longer to arrive than the others I ordered at the same time
4,Wife loved the perfume,Purchased this for the wife's birthday and she absolutely loves the perfume. I made an excellent choice.Thank you
5,A must read for any stepparent adjusting to stepchildren!,"This book is a remarkable resource for me as I adjust to two teenage stepsons. The process of adjustment ~ for the entire family ~ can truly be a difficult one. Believe me, I know! ""Realities"" offers some common sense ways to refresh your perspective. Common sense that can sometimes be difficult to find on one's own in the midst of turmoil. The ""Take Time"" sections encourages stepparents to make an honest evaluation of specific issues.""Stepparent Realities"" has, in a very short time, improved the dynamics in my relationships with my stepkids and my husband."
4,Musical Transcendence or Just a Bad Hair Day,"The Shaggs - the enigma, the legacy, the impossible musical feats. It's fairly hard to characterize or describe them.This is an album for someone who wants to hear sounds that they'll never encounter before. For someone who wants to experience a contemporary audio atavism. For someone who dares travel to the edge of known music.I actually enjoy listening to their music - there's a strange exotic naivete to it that is refreshingly challenging."
1,I can't see why the Wall Street Journal wrote it up.,"This is incredibly bad. It is obvious why they never got released. Listen to the music samples, and save your money."
2,Like a car accident,"I won't judge anyone who thinks it's great or try to infer his or her reasons.I bought it after reading Chusid's book. It is like the proverbial car accident.....you can't look and yet you can't look away. I was transfixed by a sound unlike any other in the Universe. It truly is Unique and I listened to the whole thing, unbelieving yet unable to turn it off.And I never listened to it again."
4,I like it,"An interesting album, though it's probably best in small doses. Certainly a one-of-a-kind thing. Although to some extent it does just sound like some kids banging out music, for brief moments everything comes together and it sounds catchy and oftentimes remarkably like music years ahead of it's time. At many moments the instrumental aspect sounds almost exactly like some basic form of punk music. Worth a listen."
1,What were they smoking...?,"Wow, I was left speechless. When people say that their music is interesting, is interesting some slang term for awful? Their music sounds like a cat getting hit by a truck and getting stuck in the tire and just sqeeling and hissing all the time. I truly feel sorry for their instruments.The lowest you can go is one star? I wish you could into negative stars because that's how bad their music is. I bet it is good suicide music. Their music is awful, and if you buy their cd, it is 3o minutes of laughter."
5,The movie that made Schwarzenegger synonomous with action!,"Before The Matrix and Battlefield Earth there was The Terminator. For the 80's this was the pinnacle of sci-fi creation and with the tools available they did a marvelous job. A terminator, a heartless, mindless, beast of apocolaptic creation, designed for one thing, to kill you [similar to the IRS]. One of the truely great sci-fi movies. This was the movie that propelled me into sci-fi as a kid and still entices me now."
4,Much improved over the the original DVD release,"If you've already layed out money for the bare-bones DVD, as I did, you would do well for yourself to lay out more for this one. The 5.1 surround sound is excellent, if limited by the original mono soundtrack. The improved video transfer, still a bit grainy due to the style it was filmed in, makes this the best-looking video ever released for the film. The real selling point, however, are the bonus features. There are two informative retrospectives with interviews with most of the cast and crew. But the true jewels are the deleted scenes with director commentary. Watch them and see some of the plot devices that set up the sequel. Ever since the release of the T2 ""Ultimate Edition"", the original Terminator DVD just seemed sadly lacking. Finally, this ""Special Edition"" places this great film in the light it deserves."
1,Message to MGM and Amazon: UP YOURS!!!,"BEWARE!! This DVD is not as advertised! It isn't a double-sided ""special edition"". Lies! The features listed above are not here. I have a DVD-ROM player and could find no such hidden menu features. I've bought this DVD EXPECTING these features. er....???? A waste. MGM is a complete screw-up company. Their package designed is half-arsed. This looks completely hacked together by Photoshop. You can clearly see where the original picture was cropped, and they cropped the laser sight. ???? Also take a look at their ridiculous ""modern"" redisign of To Live and Die in LA. I hope somebody there is reading this. You've made the LIST. A complete waste of a classic."
5,"""Phase plasma rifle in the 40 watt range."" ""Just what you see pal.'","Awesome time traveling movie complete with cyborg, lots of actions, comical scenes, romance, a little some thing for everyone. My favorite part has to be where Bill Paxton is in the park with his friends, laughing about Arnold, well, of course no one laughs at Arnold. Well any way, a total classic. About a man who travels back in time to save the ""mother of the future"", from a killer cyborg in short. Don't like to give away to many details, definelty worth watching over and over. Never tire of this classic."
4,true classic,Schwarzeneggers Terminator debut is the best one in myopinion but the technic isnt that good escpecially inthe last scenes animation of the robot ist done quitsimple for its time ok but today truely bad.as for the imagequality forget about that fast.Blu Ray is no magician but it is defenetly the best version when it comes to clear picturesbut no comparison to a new movie thats filmed with HD equipment.
4,Great movie,"Great movie, pretty impressive FX for it's time. The Blu-ray version suffers a little due to this movie's old master. It's no where near being Pirates of the Carabean clear (Probably the best Blu-ray video quality so far).There are some extras, one which show the making of the FX, which is a plus.But for 19 dollars, it's a no brainer. Get Blu-Ray version if you don't already own DVD version."
2,Don't buy now in auctions - wait!,"A new release of this film on DVD is in the pipeline - already a 2-disc special edition has been released this month in PAL R2 and R4 - it is expected to be out in R1 either at the end of this year or early next year.R2 & R4 DVDs have Dolby Digital 5.1 surround, deleted scenes, trailers and documentaries. No commentary or original mono soundtrack (though I don't especially care about the last one). Hopefully when the R1 edition comes out the above mentioned deficiencies may be corrected - if not still worth buying."
4,Blu-ray disc modest transfer,"This is the fifth title I have seen in Blu-ray, and it is the weakest. I think it is due to the condition of the original master. There is much grain throughout. Black tones could be darker, colors should be more vibrant. The disc freezes for a second as Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese arrive at the Tiki Motel, and the audio drops out for a second during their love scene. I think this is also a mastering problem and not a result of the Samsung BD-P1000 (the only Blu-ray disc player currently on the market). The rest of the audio is top notch. Probably the best this film has ever sounded. I was able to pick up background noise and nuances I never heard on VHS, Laserdisc, or standard DVD. All in all, it is a modest transfer. But I remember that some of the first DVD's didn't look so hot. Maybe a re-issue of this title later on will fix any transfer issues."
3,The Terminator wasn't good,"The sound effects especially the gun shots were notthe original movie. The extras were great, but it wasn'tthe same as the original."
5,Thumbs way up!,"I'm giving the mgm release the terminator(special edition) a thumbs up,it was great watching it in a newly mastered surround sound as opposed to the old mono version,great features on the dvd as well,i was waiting a long time for a newly mastered vesion featuring surround sound and it has arrived,enjoy!"
5,"Awesome movie, and good blu-ray.","Awesome move, one of the best action movies of all time, and the blu-ray transfer is good, I highly recommend it on blu-ray, it looks great!!!!!!!!!!"
3,S'alright,"I like the movie. Made a long time ago, so there are some puppet parts that look to fake. Other than that, I still like the movie. I'm sure I'll watch it again."
3,Terminator DVD Review,The 1984 Treminator is an interesting movie but is marred by a cheap musical score. Perhaps it should be re-released with a new score. The 1.85:1 widescreen DVD is of high quality and enhanced for 16:9 TVs.
1,be careful ! no extra material !,I just receive my copy and what a surprise !The only extra on this DVD is THE TERMINATOR trailer !
1,movie is great but image lousy,"well, how can they sell such a Blu Ray disc... the image is not so good - with black grainy dots showing up on the screen sometimes, and the resolution is not so high. So later when it is done properly, it will be sold again for another 20 or 25 bucks huh? I'd say people who bought this version should be entitled to a replacement of the proper production level product."
2,"Awesome film, lousy blu-ray","I should have known that when a blu-ray disc was selling for under $10 that something was wrong. Sure enough, the picture quality is pretty much the same as a regular DVD. The fact that it's selling for such a low price probably means that somebody is wising up and will soon issue a better quality blu-ray version. My advice is to pass up on this offer and instead wait for the definitive treatment."
1,Terminator Blu Ray,"I just bought my first blu ray player and also purchased Terminator 1-3They really have no business calling this edition ""blu ray"" it looks about the same as my regular edition DVD I have had for years (the special edition with the embossed cover kind of like a hologram) The sound on the blu ray is pretty good, but it's another bare bones with only the same special features as the regular special edition. I am sure that at some point they will release another and we can only hope the video is upgraded and they pack it full of special features.This disc is simply the regular Terminator DVD packaged as a blu ray and the people who released it should be ashamed of themselves and maybe a class action law suit too!On the other hand it was about 7 bucks so whatever. Don't listen to the people who say the picture quality is improved, they probably work for the company that released it. This movie deserves better and in my opinion ""The Terminator"" has not been released on blu ray yet."
5,FANTASTIC sound and picture quality!,"This updated version of the classic Terminator movie is by far the best this movie's ever been. The sound and picture quality on this DVD are top notch, and you'd never guess the movie is over 15 years old. The sound must be heard to be believed, with the remixed 5.1 digital making good use of all surround sound channels. I personally rent for the extras and buy for the picture/sound quality, but the extras on here are very nice as well."
2,"Great Movie, Awful Video Transfer",I don't know why MGM can't do a decent video transfer of this movie. The disc is not worthy of the blu-ray format and is certainly not worth buying if you already own the DVD.
3,Same DVD,"Alright, The Terminator is a classic that helped proppel Arnold S and director Cameron to fame, so I won't bother reviewing the movie because I give it 5 stars all the way, even though I prefer T2.Okay let's be serious. If you're expecting to get a new DVD edition you're wrong. This is still the same DVD as the last release. Nothing new except now it has a nice sleeve. Now if you don't own a copy and you want the sleeve (Like me) this is good, but if you already own the last release don't buy this one. It is no different except for the nice sleeve that covers it."
4,Great start and intro into one of the biggest sets of movies ever done,"The Terminator is by far a classic among movies even to this day and age I still enjoy watching this first movie in a set of movies that gave meaning to science fiction action movies. I don't own the whole set of 4 movies because I didn't care for number three in the set, but I still have this one, T2 Judgement Day, and number 4 Terminator Salvation. But back to this one this movie set the stage for all over action movies of this style, plus it gave us one of the memorable movie lines ever because of the Police station scene. ""I'll be back."" I assume most people have watch the Terminator sets, but if you are one of few people who have yet to see this first one of the set pick this movie up and see what you have been missing all these years. Between all the car chase scenes, gun fights, things being blown up just makes the action and drama and few other elements even more enjoyable of a movie. It's well worth the money."
4,The Begininator: The Movie that Started it All,"This is a classic movie to the point where it has become a serious cliche. However it is well made and finely paced. The soundtrack is seriously '80s but otherwise fine. Most importantly, however, this movie paved the road for the very excellent second movie.The effects are dated, but they work well enough for the movie because they are shot with competence and an eye towards the end result of the movie.Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton work well together and Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast here in a rare (for him at least) villain role."
1,Impressive Film Unimpressive Format,"I liked THE TERMINATOR when I originally saw it. I think it was somewhat innovative and Arnold Schwarzenegger was very good as the cyborg that will stop at nothing to accomplish his mission. Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance seems to have been inspired by Yul Brynner as the gunslinger robot in WESTWORLD. Brynner's obsessively determined performance was brilliant in that film. However, returning to the subject of this format it seems to be not what it was touted to be. Unfortunately this Blu-ray disc seems to bring out the imperfections from the master print or whatever print they used to copy THE TERMINATOR onto this disc. I found the picture very annoying to watch because of this. I can only give this product 1 star for that reason."
3,Not All Re-releases are the same,"This is defintely a Sci-Fi classic. My review is gonna be a comparision to the previous DVD release and not about the movie since probably half the planet has seen it. Picture quality is the same as before with extras footages among other 'extras' to make it a 'Special Edition' This was a nice addition. Sound quality on the other hand was VERY DISSAPOINTING since it's suppose to be Dolby Digital 5.1 EX encoded. Compared to the Star Wars EP 1's DD 5.1 EX, this DVD should have been just left with the original surround sound instead. Even in 'Enhanced 6.1,' other DSP formats, it's still kinda flat with what you would expect of this DVD compared to other movies. Bottom line: picture quality, movie and extras were great. Sound quality was lacking though."
3,"""classic"", but...","Considering that you probably want to see only the first 5-10 minutes of this movie-well, you know why-then maybe you are paying too much."
1,Sounds like Socialism to me.,"I would be very careful reading this book and taking political sides because protectionism is the way to go.If you are truly interested in this topic please read these books as well:""The Power of Productivity"" by William H Lewis""The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities of Our Time"" by Jeffrey Sachs.Perhaps one day the American worker will take some responsibility with respect to competing globally and stop whining. Americans need to become aggressive with education and innovation in order to create new opportunities or we will continue to lose ground in the global arena.Charlie"
5,In a word: INCREDIBLE!,"...The new Canon S900 and S9000 series kick out what appear to be the same quality (if not better) photos than you get from your local film processing center. It's THAT good! I was floored by the performance of my S9000 when I unboxed it last night and printed out a few photos I had taken with my Canon PowerShot G2.Utilizing the included Easy-Photo software, I was able to easily choose the image, print layout and paper type. (Easy-Photo now supports the EXIF data from my G2 further enhancing the print quality.)Other items worth mentioning: indivual ink cartridges, removable/replaceable print head, it's stylish, fast, and very, very quiet. I suggest that you run to your local computer store and have them demo the Canon S900 or S9000 printer so you can see for yourself."
3,Bissinger full of BS,"I played on this team.The book is a good read, but don't believe all the nonsense Bissinger throws out there. He dramatizes much of the story. The racism is overblown, Boobie Miles was never that great, and despite what he thinks, competition is a good thing."
4,Good book,I liked this book. It is a very telling story of how a towns priorities can be misguided. Athletics over academics.
1,HORRIBLE,What an anti-climatic book- very disappointing considering the acclaimed movie- I read it in a book club and we ALL agreed it was a waste of our reading time. Author just drones on and on about the city of Odessa.
4,"good book, definately worth reading","Overall a good book, but I sympathize with the Permian fans who didn't like what Bissinger did. As an outsider I noticed how Bissinger got really into the games especially the playoff games, he seemed so intense and you could tell he love being apart of it, but when they lost he jumped back out and acted like he couldn't believe how serious these people took football."
3,friday night lights,"i thought that this book was just ok. it was just a meteocre book for me. yes, it is a good representation of big town fame and spotlight in a small town. it just did not hit the spot for me thats it."
4,Good football book.,This is a great book for those who enjoy football as much as me. It tells a story of a high school football team in texas where all the town lived around football.
2,Perhaps not a great permanent car kit...,"I've had my unit for about a week now with the intention of leaving it in my car all the time. It performs well enough in my limited usage, but perhaps the biggest drawback is that it automatically turns itself off after 5 minutes when your phone is out of bluetooth range. The power connector (USB to cigarette lighter) is only for charging the internal battery. So, this means that every time you get in the car, you have to turn the unit on by pressing the power button for 2 seconds. What an oversight. Why not just make the unit wake when power is applied? Anyway, this is a deal breaker for me. My unit is going back."
1,Just broken after 1 month,"I have been used this product for a month, after the first month the turn on/off button got inside. Now I can't turn on my device"
2,Parrot review,Does not work that well. Callers have a hard time hearing me at times Would not recommend this item to anyone.
4,If you are looking for a good Bluetooth speaker phone.,"This minikit is a good product for many reasons It keeps both hands on the wheel. You are able to place and recieve calls with a touch of a button. The voice quality is good on both ends. The battery life is about 10 hours of talktime (and somewhere like 200 hours on standby).The only thing that is a little difficult is programing this device. There is no display sceen It just has voice prompts, but with a little trial and error it's easy to get past.The kit comes with a car and home charger. It is worth the money!"
1,unsatisfactory,"The Parrot Mini Kit was easy to use and connected with my phone immediately. The BIG PROBLEM was it turned on the phone (Treo 655p) every 10 to 30 seconds with no incoming call. This happened continuously whenever the unit was turned on. I wrote an email to the Parrot contact address and have never received a reply. I put it back in the original box and returned it to Amazon. By the way, I am impressed with the Amazon return policy, its ease of use and the fact that it did not cost me anything except to drop it off at the UPS service center."
4,Nice Item,"This was for my 10-year old grandson, who is an avid fisherman and quite competent with knives. He did have a little problem opening up the knife, but I suggested WD-40 and he loves it!"
3,Door-mounted kitchen garbage can with trash door,As described above it says it came with a lid. It does not come with a lid. Guess I should have read the small print. This is the second time that I have bought from Amazon and not had the item be as described. Otherwise the item was fine. I did not return item
2,At least it wasn't a long movie!,"What an odd comedy, lampooning the Salem Witch Trials...a bit late in the day for that type of social commentary (so they tried to tie it to a picture of Nixon briefly shown during a trial sequence?). Not funny by half: crotch jokes and manure jokes are for the desperate. There's a reason this movie didn't last long in theaters nor did it become an underground cult favorite. Its humor is old and forlorn.Not a keeper. (But I'm not sorry I watched it this once. I did laugh a couple of times but I can't remember at what.)"
1,Poo,"Yikes. Not so fantastic. The addvert for Monty Python's Holy Grail before the feature came on was better. Spent my time amusing myself with the vague notion the lead was a young David Hasselhoff with about as much acting cred as demonstrated (which was zero). Kept waiting for them to break out into song for some reason: maybe a musical would have helped it along? Or possibly another movie? Probably not though. Had to watch a repeat of something on TV with addverts afterwards, just to lift my mood enough to go to sleep.Out of five, half. Of one. That's 0.5/10I've always been a generous soul."
5,SSWWWWEEEEEEEEETTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I really love this game! It's fun to play story mode against huge bosses and overwhelming odds or to kick the computers sorry @$$ with a friend. You always have to look for new guys to beat so the Gotcha box can use their info to make one for you. Every character has a long range attack even if their wearing bronze knuckles! This game is one of those games like Super Smash Bros. where you can play it FOREVER!!!! BUY IT, YOU'll LIKE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Doesn't work with music,"Once I put in the batteries it started up, but that was all it did. It didn't work with an ipod or with any of the patterns. Sometimes it doesn't even turn on. :("
5,vibrant music,"Wow, what a great gift this made, every women should have one. Suddenly rap music has taken over her ipod as it really hits the spot."
4,Great!,"This book is great for any Louisa May Alcott Fan. Even today, some of the situations that Polly goes through are valid and interesting. Though 130 years old, the characters and themes are still applicable with a slight stretch of the imagination and some thought. The plot is not thrilling, but bounces along at a steady pace and is enjoyable. As always with older books, the language is sometime a little difficult to decode when they talk about things from the period. I throughly enjoyed this book. It's another Louisa May Alcott great!"
2,24 Eyes,"This Insomniac Pictures version of ""24 Eyes"" is recorded in Region 2, not Region 0. Not advertised properly or playable."
4,fountainhead,"i enjoyed the movie for the story it told... if u bought the movie, i assume you've read the book or at least Atlas Shrugged and you know the author's feelings on Objectivism... considering when the film was produced, i must say that i think the director did a fantastic job illustrating Ayn Rand's work... i did enjoy it... I cant wait till Atlas Shrugged is made into a movie"
2,Just Not Good,"I read Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged about a year after I had started college. I can definitely say that that book changed my life.I could see the logistical problems with making Atlas Shrugged into a movie. The book is just so unbelievably complex - you could read it a dozen times and get something new out of it each time. It would seem impossible to fit everything into a single movie.This film does a horrible job in the attempt. It jumps from scene to scene without any explanation really. The only reason that I had some clue as to what was going on was because I had read the book. I don't understand how all the other reviewers could have missed this. I wanted to love this movie, but it was impossible."
2,Bad Mistake On My Part,"I just realized that I kept typing ""Atlas Shrugged"" where I meant to type ""The Fountainhead"".All the comments I made pertain to this movie. I don't know why I mixed up the names like that."
3,I only gave this a 3 star because we haven't seen it yet,"I assume it will be fine. It is a Christmas gift for our Philosopy major daughter so nobody has seen this yet but since the original film was great, we expect to enjoy this too."
2,"Half Great, Half Garbage","Oh, it's hard to rate this film with stars.The problem is dramatic; Pat Neal is mesmerizing as Dominique, and Vidor moves the movie along with brilliant momentum.Then we have Gary Cooper, who seems embarrassed - as well he should - by the cartoonish dialogue. All right, Rand wants to ram her objectivist views down every available throat. But surely someone with a sense of good dialogue was near the set? Her screenplay is riddled with sentiments expressed as subtly as the 'Ka-POWS!' in the Batman TV show. Herds of sheeplike businessmen say 'But what's the good in originality?', or, 'Look here, old man, one mustn't fight popular opinion!'. It's really that banal.Too bad. I don't much care about the philosophy Rand espouses, either way. What bothers me is that a ridiculously clumsy trumpeting of it ruins what good have been a classic film."
5,Ayn Rand was so ahead of the game!,"Being an Architect I am partial to this movie and of coarse Gary Cooper was a perfect fit for his role. The amazing part is how true the movie was for it's time and even more so in today's day. Condemned by so many conformist and liberal press, it is amazing how true many of her theories have come true. Her popularity has sored more than ever. Personally I think her work should be a part of college or even high school curriculum and maybe the future of tomorrow may have a better chance. It far exceeds some of the garbage taught in universities today. Highly recommended movie for you old classic movie enthusist and for all people who believe in individualism and independent capitalism growth."
1,Typical Robin Williams Junk,"This is not a funny movie -- unless you enjoy using a person's personal problems as a vehicle for scenes of gratuitous sex and violence, and a lot of barely humorous wisecracks. It's a typical Robin Williams movie; how many times do you need to see him try to cackle and doubletalk his way through some serious situations in his lame attempts at humor? Robin Williams is not a comedian, and certainly is not a serious actor, which leaves no reason to view these pointless films."
3,Vinny Capone,"I thought this was a good movie but I thought it was better when I found out someone I knew through my brother-in-law was in it. Robin Williams daughter in the movie,the guy who played her boyfriend. Vinny Capone is a great guy and I hope to see him in more films and not just as a stunt guy, which he does now."
3,Cadillac Man,"While I adore Robin Williams and see almost anything he makes, this is definately not one of his best. It's just not really funny. There ae a couple of good scenes and the story line should have made it a winner, but somehow it falls short. The story is about a car salesman who has a deadline to meet of selling 12 cars in a day or be fired. He's in trouble with his ex wife, tries to balance two girlfriends, the Mafia is after him and a brainless motorcyclist runs into the store (literally) and tries to find out who's messing with his girl. He holds everyone hostage and it is up to Robin's character to get everyone out alive. Ending is quite predictable."
5,Good taste,"This movie caught my attention just by the title, I didn't have to read a review or anything but It's a goof of a movie!The films opens with some beautiful New Zealand locations with Derekthe main character (and boy is he) with an alien hanging from one leg on a very high cliff. the alien is disguised as a human of course.The plot is a bunch of dopey cannibal aliens land on earth to take back humans and open a fast food chain in outer space>.The special effects are gory & bloody, some silly scenes like where one of the aliens is eating the brains out of some guys head that was shot earlier by Barry. Oh he's another one of the human heroesThe best (and most silly)scene is the one where the aliens capture this [guy] and tie him up and gag him. Guess where he winds up?Theres many great scenes in this movie, but if your squeamish go rent a Disney movie instead. I loved it!"
2,Not very well made,I would recommend getting cheaper sheets made for a playpen. These started unraveling after one wash! Not worth the money.
4,co-sleeper sheet,The color is a close match. It is a good quality sheet. I would recommend to anyone who purchased the co-sleeper so you can change the sheet after spit ups
3,Slightly different than same sheet ordered from elsewhere,"This sheet fits well on the co-sleeper mattress. However, though I have another toffee sheet, this one is a slightly different color. Also, the bottom doesn't have the Velcro strips on the bottom that the other has. Since the sheet fits so well, I'm not too concerned about it coming off, bunching up, and becoming a hazard.I have three sheets total because they do need frequent washings because of spit up. Because these are supposed to not go in the dryer, it takes a while before they are ready to go back on the bed."
5,Something to watch over and over again.,"This is one of my favorite movies in that it seems to have it all. Romance, Action, Drama ... and the music is beautiful. The scenery is brethtaking. The acting is first rate and just a joy to watch."
4,cell phone holder,I bought two of these as I had one in the past. The velcro wore out on my girst one. One of the new ones I bought came a part the stitching came lose after the first week. I spent more to get it repaired than I did for both phone holders combined. Over all they are very good and stay on your belt very well. I would buy them again but if they need repair throw them away. Cost for repairs was $10.00 to get it resewen.
3,Heart to Heart,Interesting to hear a cardiologist incorporate alternative cures. Few physicians treat the whole individual. This book is very clear for the lay person to comprehend.
1,Terrible,The book says it was lightly used but it looked like someone dropped it in a pool. A pool of Koolaid.
3,good beginner's microscope,"a good beginner's microscope (you get what you pay for). My only complaint is that the light does not work very well, but my son is still able to use the microscope and for the most part enjoys it."
2,Skip This Microscope,"I bought this for my seven year old daughter. My father, who spent 41 years of his life working in a laboratory, had trouble getting the device set up so we could see anything. It really is a toy - and very difficult to maneuver. I wish I had saved the money and bought a higher quality microscope from The Discovery Store."
2,'Phoney Corvette' summer,"I've seen this movie more times than I'd care to admit. That phoney Corvette hood with all the Pep Boys stick-ons just makes me want to puke. Annie Potts was a pretty cute hooker though. If you really want to get sick FOR FREE, see it for free on Speedvision's Lost Drive-In. It got stolen and stolen. To bad they didn't just lose it."
4,About time this was released on DVD,"I remember this Movie on TV long ago. Of course I thought the Corvette was way cool back then, now? Not so much. It's just a little to corny now. I sure didn't remember Annie Potts looking so hot back then. It's still a fun movie to watch."
4,BLIND FURY,"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE WHICH SHOWS HOW AN INDIVIDUAL MAY OVERCOME A PHYSICAL HANDICAP TO EXCEL IN A MANNER MAKING HIS QUITE LETHAL TO THOSE WHO WOULD/COULD CAUSE HARM TO OTHERS. R. HAUER IS QUITE BELIEVABLE IN HIS ROLE AS NICK AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR THOSE WHO, LIKE MYSELF, WORK AS A THERAPIST FOR MENTALLY CHALLENGED ADULTS. THEY ENJOYED IT AS WELL AS OUR DISCUSSION. THANK YOU. BYB"
3,Joseph Kuo hidden classic!!!!!!,"If you liked ""7 Grandmasters, and The Mystery Of Chessboxing"", you must buy this film. Hwang Jung Lee is an evil guy doing his dirty work, watch and see what he does as an evil guy in this film against the shaolin temple. Not bad Joseph, not bad at all."
3,Nice item but had to return it,"The appearance and quality look good, but the item would not work with my vehicle. The description could have been more clear about the mounting requirements and the fact that the mirror is not reverseable and therefore cannot be used on either side. In defense of Amazon, they were very prompt and helpful in arranging a return and full refund. Thank you. In summary, a more detailed product description would have saved some trouble."
1,Doesn't work,Often stops a minute or two into timing something -- more often than not! Save your money. This would be like throwing your money away.
1,Olfactory pain from the house of Guerlain,"Bought this for my wife to try. We both agreed: not a good scent.Guerlain has created some incredible frags, most notably their Vetiver and Shalimar scents. This has no place in their line-up. It's certainly complex and multi-layered, as to be expected from this perfumer. However, it just doesn't smell good at all. It starts with a sour edge of rotten fruit, and dries to a powdery smell of mulch and detritus and never really leaves behind the sticky sweetness of a plum gone bad.Hilary Swank has two Oscars. Too bad she doesn't have her face on a fragrance worth wearing. Disappointed."
1,This was entertainment?,If I could give this no stars then I would. It was utter rubbish from start to end. Although I have liked Terry Gilliams work this has to be the biggest waste of time ever.
5,A visual feast; a comedic glory.,"I just want to say that this is an almost perfect movie. Some people won't ""get it""--but if you like surrealism, mythology, fairy tales and English humor, you'll love it. Visually exquisite. Great acting."
3,"Great Movie,Bad HD conversion","I had read previous reviews stating the poor quality of the Blu-Ray version but bought it anyway. I love this movie and only owned a VHS version. Instead of buying a standard DVD version for a few dollars less than Blu-Ray, I opted for Blu-Ray. Yes it's a bit grainy but still love the movie."
1,Too much stuff,"My cat Gussie is a tv-watcher, especially animal shows. So we figured she'd be a prime candidate for a kitty video. But before laying out any money, we tested what we could find at the library. One title, Cat TV, she loved. She sat and watched, she stood up on her hind legs to see better and swatted at the screen to catch the little birdies, etc.So we ordered it. But it turned out to be a different video by the same name. This one intersperses its bird-feeder birds and mice, etc., with the sound of cats meowing (not music to her ears) and someone dishing out yummy-looking catfood for a large group of cats to eat. But Gussie didn't get any! She loses interest in this video quickly.I recommend the other one with the same title, which I have tracked down from Media West Inc. and ordered through their website.Now she is a happy Gussie!"
2,Sloppiness and Laziness,"While this book contains many positions and some interesting positions, I am however the author didn't put much care or thought into this book. It appears to sort of database dump for combinations....The names and places are the games are not noted. In fact some positions appear more than once in the book!There are alot of better books, in fact are quite a few in which the author probably looked at all the positions!"
1,not worth the money,"I looked forward to getting this book. Imagine my regret when I found out that most of the positions in this book come from Fred Reinfelds combination books such as 1001 combinations and sacrifices. I thought I was getting a book that would offer ORIGINAL material. If the book was original this book would be a sure classic, but its nothing of the kind. I gave the book to charity and hopefully some good will come out of it. I should have listened to the previous reviewer about saving your money. If you want combination books Reinfelds are the best. Read his chess books and you will see why he was an early inductee to the chess hall of fame. He was an original and not taking material from other writers."
5,All you need to begin to learn in step by step instructions.,"Mrs. Hauser's book is a wonderful step-by-step guide to learning basic brush strokes of decorative painting and complete information on supplies whether you paint in acrylic or oils. She explains EVERYTHING! Preparing surfaces, Finishing surfaces, everything inbetween and even explains why! She has covered different brushes and what they do, and supplies for whichever medium you decide to do and always what and why you need them. I love this book!!"
2,boring story,Starts out okay but then it`s down hill the rest of the way. Once you know the guy is insane (not hard to figure out) it doesn`t need to be illustrated over and over until you finally get to the end of the film. It just gets boring along the way.
1,Pointless,(1.) Cheaply produced.(2.) Another mentally ill person kills family member(s) movie. Tiresome.(3.) Bizarrely robotic acting.(4.) Attempt to be avant garde creative led to pointless scene after scene of nothing happening interviews & discussions that have little to do with a murder or the direct events leading up to it in the remotest sense.(5.) Don't even see the actual event. Too costly.
3,"Cool look, not functional","I really like the look of the soap pump, but when I tighten the top, it keeps going around and around, it never really tightens up, so its like it doesn't work correctly. I think it is defective. The pump works ok, but the top keeps falling off."
5,Great looking tissue box,"Nice looks, sturdy feel. Goes along great with my other stainless steel bathroom accesories. Would definately recommend."
1,"Horrible quality, good looking.","This is a nice looking soap pump, but the quality is horrible. I bought the first one and the top pump completely broke (the bearings fell out) after about six months. I purchased a second one and it lasted about three days before the pump quit working."
3,"Very, very shiny","It's much shinier than pictured - more like a mirror. It's not worth returning, but I probably wouldn't have bought it if I'd known."
3,STINK!,"This is a great product, but.....the smell for me is almost a deal breaker. As soon as you open you will know, just has the typical multivitamin smell, on roids! Next time I'll get a different form other than tablets."
1,File 13,"The first thing I did when I finished this book was throw it away! This for me is an odd thing to do as I reread books many times. I didn't even want this book on my shelf! It promises just a little page by page. Not enough to make you want to read it in one sitting, just enought so it nags the back of your mind. You read, hoping for one kick-ass ending and it makes you want to scream with frustration and throw in in the trash can.Which is exactly what I did.(one star because there is nothing lower.)"
3,"Good Software Book, Bad Business Process Change Book","This book is geared too much towards IT process changes and can never escape its software base of knowledge to address general business process change in a meaningful way. It was required reading for a business process improvement class and I never went beyond the required reading because it just wasn't useful. This might be useful for an IT project lead but anyone else would be better served by any one of the many books on Toyota, Six Sigma, or Lean."
5,Business Process Change,"This book was recommended by several of my lean consulting friends, who specialize in agile project management, as an excellent source for documenting and analyzing process workflows in complex environments. I agree, this book is a must read for people tasked with redesigning informational workflows in service systems. I have read it twice and continue to learn new ways to analyze business processes."
2,"Good premise, good start, but ultimately BORING","I know the crazed teenage zombie fans who love anything that features an undead guy walking will pan this review, but please let me (and the other negative reviews) try to convince you that this is a huge waste of time.Admittedly, it was a great premise with some fair acting and make-up, and the stairwell massacre scene is a very good zombie gore sequence (oh man, that spinal column rip!) But at 1 hour 37 minutes ""Colin"" is WAY too long. They could have tied it all up in an hour. I found myself fast-forwarding the last 45 minutes, and all my friends had long left the room...I guess I'm just that zombie purist holdout.According to one of the other negative reviewers, this was NOT the first movie to portray the zombie perspective, which surprises me, as this movie was touted as revolutionary. I would NOT spend money on ""Colin"" and I'm sorry I did."
1,AVOID!,"Well if you have seen the great classic dark mini series, AVOID this comedy that isn't even a good one."
3,Worth a look,"This is certainly not the turkey some critics labelled it as when it was first released in the late 80's. It's actually pretty funny and immensely entertaining, but for me, the highlight is Meryl Streep, obviously having a ball here in her first ever comedy, giving an incredibly full out, hilarious caricatured performance. When she's on screen, you just don't watch anyone else."
4,FUN,I love this movie. It has real comdey basic in it. If you are looking for a good laugh this is the movie for you.
2,Looks very difficult to install because harness doesn't plug into factory plug.,"Bought for my son along with new radio/stereo, backup camera, and several other electronics for his van and he instated everything with no problem except the DVD player which looked too difficult for us. In fact a stereo install shop said they wouldn't attempt it either."
5,Terrific Product,"This dvd player has options that alot of more expensive units have, and the quality is very nice too. Wireless headphones are a great option that the kids love, resume play is great so Mom and Dad do not have to keep restarting the movie on long trips. So, this is a very nice unit, well worth the money!!!!!"
1,Ruined my trip!,"I have to say I am completely disappointed with this product. I purchased it from Best Buy the day before I left for a trip to Utah. The first roll: it stopped taking pictures after the 17th one. I had to put in a new roll. The second roll: it stopped functioning after the 22nd picture. I was devastated. I developed the pictures and most of them have red eyes, and the quality is horrible. I am shocked that this product passed Canon's quality controls. I have another Canon camera that I am crazy about. I have returned the new one; I wish I had read the reviews on Amazon.com before buying it. Trust me...DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!"
2,Not very impressive...,"We bought the Elph Z3 for our baby's first Christmas pictures and we are sorry that we did! Nearly every picuture was blurry and everyone had red-eyes...so much for red-eye reduction! What a disappointment!FYI...APS film cost more to develop and even more for black and white film, some shops don't develop APS either.I've had [cheap]cameras produce better pictures. The Z3 is getting returned today!"
3,Now I understand,"Wanted to give 4 stars, but rated 3 because it is not an easy read. The concepts and reasoning make sense. Recognizes humankind's attempt to bring a much higher power to an understandable level; or to mold an ideal into a form that justifies oneself -- regardless of how far short one's actions fall. Will break rationalizations of believers, or explain the diversity of a common belief to a non believer."
4,"crazy, fun,... again fun kung fu + wu xia movie!","Kwun( Jet Li) finds his family and friends dead when he comes back to his village. The evil government has killed them all and Kwun swears revenge with his new born son.... definitely Not Jet Li's finest........but we all love Hk cinema's overacted drama, romance and crazy fight sequnces right???"
2,"Fun film, poor release.","This is a fun film and one of the few from the period where Jet just seems to have some fun and go off. But this is a pretty sorry release for it. So Tai Seng is releasing widescreen laser disc masters again? Niiicccee. Wait for a better release. At least that one might not have a Ric Meyers commentary on there. If there's a sure sign of a lack of care from a company releasing kung fu films, it's Meyers' name anywhere on the product."
2,americans know how to screw up a good movie,OK this is really legend of shaolin sense Americans cant handle good Chinese humor. This is one of my favorite jet li movies but if you want to see it go for the Chinese version the English version is missing a lot of the story and the jokes.foot note I am Irish American in case any one cares and thinks I am bad mouthing Americans. I was born and raised American.
3,Could Have Been Better,"This is one that started out looking like it would be a great movie but then slipped into eternal silliness,while the fights are nothing to be laughed at, with great choreography they can't make up for all the stupid characters (other than the kid and jet of course)who put a damper on the movie.If you just want to see a few good fights than by all means this is a good purchase,but if your looking for more than that then look else where."
2,It is okay,"I really think this is Ray Harryhausen's worst. The story is okay. It is nothing new. It had a boring Sinbad. I hated how thaT ACTOR ACTED. The film was okay. the effects were nothing new. The beginning is my favorite, A giant seal appears in the beginning. If it did not have a good beginning, I would of rated it 1 star"
3,Not Too Bad,"Just ""go with the flow"" on this one. It's a ""cheesey"" plot, in more ways than one. But, it is fun to see Harryhausen's work in motion. It took me a while to finally recognize Jane Seymour, because she is so young in this movie. Anyway, you can enjoy watching it with your young family."
3,"Good blanket, average quality",The quality of the blanket did not stand up very well.Overall decent blanket though.
2,kerouac it is not,"complete with a visit to wm burroughs, paterniti spends alot of time trying to figure out how to make this into an interesting trip, but fails. some of the more interesting pieces are vignettes into the life and head of einstein which can be better appreciated in a biography. sadly, none of the ""characters"" he meets on the road are very interesting. his ties to his personal problems are also shallow and out of place. i can't even say i found the character of the doctor interesting. if you're looking for a road book, go to the best--on the road by jack kerouac. this book is a pretty good short story that grew too long."
2,Lacks Brainpower,"This book seemed to have all the ingredients and starts out great - absorbing characters - zippy narrative - a cross-country roadtrip. Unfortunately, it runs out of gas halfway. In the end, even a triple shot of Starbucks couldn't revive this braindead reverie. Sometimes magazine articles -- from which this was expanded -- are only a few pages long for a reason."
2,Too Many Words,"I have waited for a book from Mr. Paterniti since I read his brilliant 1997 article on Einstein's brain in Harper's Magazine, but Mr. Albert is deeply disappointing. Given a book length format the author has the time and space to go on about his apparently dwindling affair and his theories of love (""You lose each other and find each other again. Every day. Until love gathers the turtles and birds of your world and encompasses them, too.""). He labors mightily to draw clever parallels between his own life, Dr. Harvey's, Einstein's, and the laws of physics, but he rarely succeeds with grace.There are gems to be found, but I don't think it's worth the effort."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent film, showing Belfast as it really is. There is an outstanding first time performance from Ross Mc Dade. He conveys the feelings of many young people in Northern Ireland, that the past is history and we need to live in the freedom of today."
5,My Favorite of The SInbad films,"This film was perhaps my favorite Sinbad film and favorite stop animation film. Its fun, I liked JOhn Phillip Law as SInbad. ANd the creatures where my favorite. A great film, with great adventure and impressive effects."
4,"""Trust in Allah but tie up your camel.""","After the less than stellar box office of VALLEY OF GWANGI, Ray Harryhausen and Charles Schneer return to the saga of Sinbad, this played with some gusto by John Phillip Law. A beautiful damsel Caroline Munro (THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, CAPTAIN KRONOS), an evil wizard played by Tom Baker (tv's 4th DR WHO) with Douglas Wilmer (EL CID, OCTOPUSSY). A quest for Lemuria and a magic fountain, this one features batlike spies, a sword battle with six armed Kali, a Centaur Grffin fight and a scantilly clad Munro! Not as good as 7TH VOYAGE but it was a box office success. Extras are featurettes on MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, EARTH VS THE FLYING SAUCERS & 3 WORLDS OF GULLIVAR."
4,"just plain good, and you can dissect it if you want","I just watched this with my kids, and they were spellbound. There is no other word for it. The official description gives you an idea of the plot, but nothing can express the magic of a young mind that aborbs this entertainment that is as good as greek mythology (there are many similarities). I witnessed two young minds, awestruck and open, watching this and asking questions - some of which I couldn't answer, and so we must go elsewhere to find them together. What better recommendation is there than that?Warmly recommended."
4,This is a great movie.,"This movie was hilarious. Steve Martin and Michael Caine played off each other perfectly! Caine plays the straight guy who torments Martin.(Although, Caine has a scene that is so perfect!) He is playing a doctor that must test Martin's professed paralysis! It was a classic scene! Martin plays a very convincing idiot in the movie as well! Get the movie! This movie is clean,too, so you can watch it with your kids or parents (without fast-forwarding or muting)!"
4,Dirty Rotten Scoundrels DVD Review,"This is an entertaining film because of Sir Michael Caine, who is the real funny character, which shows what a versatile actor he is. Mr. Steve Martin is a fine comedian; however, in my opinion, the silly character that he played, diminished the overall quality of this film. The fact that this film was shot on location was a plus."
4,Another oldie but goodie,"A funny movie that is worth watching periodically for some good laughs, thus worth owning."
2,Good movie,"Another one I wanted for my personal collection. The movie has a ""terminal skip"" in it near the end... in fact, at a very pivotal part of the plot! :( The movie arrived quickly and in order, but.... scratched. It works on my computer, though.. but I like to watch movies on the TV... Oh well... price was right."
5,Best movie ever made!,"This hilarious movie filled with quick wits and great acting is a must-have. And as Steve Martin says- ""It is better to be truthful and good....than to not."""
4,Great series,"Starts slow, many character to become aquainted with, but by third episode I was hooked. Writing improved, intriging and is a must see."
1,Fraudulent Photo,"You will NOT get the bucket of balls shown in the product photo.You will get a little baggie of four balls as indicated in ""product features.""Things that seems too good to be true, aren't!"
1,Deceptive Advertising,"I was disappointed to receive only four foam balls in the order. The advertising picture is very deceptive. Although is does state ""4 count"", the picture surely doesn't represent what you will actually receive. This will undoubtedly be my last purchase from this supplier, and Amazon for allowing deceptive advertising on their site."
5,My first comic book read,"I loved the Witchblade series on TNT. Recently TNT announced they would be canceling the series. I've never read a comic book before in my life but I thought I would give it a try. I loved this book. I didn't realize that such an interesting story could be told via a comic book medium. I was very pleased with the book and will be ordering Vol. 2 soon. If you aren't sure if you would like a comic book but like the series, rest easy, the comic books are every bit as good as the series. By the way, I am a woman and did not find it offensive."
1,way too many pages,"Author has some fairly provocative ideas that are badly explained and repeated endlessly throughout the book. The book could have been ten pages, instead it was over a hundred. She had plenty of opportunity to site rich examples and gave nothing of any importance. This is a book in search of a good editor."
5,baseball shorts,"Bought this because my husband is a crazy Wodehouse fan, and he did like that short story, but he has enjoyed so many more!! A great collection for those who love the game and those who love good storytelling!"
3,HOLE PUNCHED!!,"I failed to read the ""lose leaf"" part of the information, so when i received the book, it came HOLE PUNCHED. be aware of that! so you don't end up fuming later on when you try selling it to other people! (i'd sell it with a binder, if i were you!)The other thing is cost- if you are cost efficient like me, and you do not plan to keep this book, buy this lose leaf version. It cost me less than half the price for the hard cover, and frankly, i hardly even use it (though it varies by colleges and teachers). And like i said above, if you plan to sell it back to students via flayers, you should sell it WITH a binder, thus getting a better chance at actually SELLING the book. Not many people go for lose leafs!"
1,Amazon's bad habits,I tried to download this item and my antivirus told me that a spybot was attempting to download with it.I asked for and received a refund. I will not download anything from Amazon again.
3,GOOD JAZZ.,"I think Donald Harrison is an excellant sax player Mr.Cool Breeze is the best song on the recording. Slowvisor is a really good chaser. This music is worth checking out if your Feelin' Jazzy, Baby"
4,The Master of Disguise,"John Candy pulls out all the stops in this action packed spoof of private detective thrillers. His antics will cause you to spit out your beer and roll on the floor in uncontrollable laughter. A great companion to the the other classic Candy flicks; ""The Great Outdoors"", ""Only the Lonely"", ""Trains, Planes, and Automobiles"", and ""Uncle Buck"". Any of the above are clearly superior to the films that came out near to or after his death."
1,Pretty much useless,"The only reason that I purchased this book is because it was required for my software engineering class in college. I must say that this book leaves much to be desired and anyone with common sense could come up with the techniques described in this book. Also, all of the information in this book can be found online with much better explanations for free. I would not recommend this book for anyone because I cannot even use it as a reference book because the information is out of date and not helpful."
1,It doesn't work.,"sometime ago I had the chance to try the Rhodiola 110 by nutrilite. It was the first time I tried it. I was amazed with the results. I could see the results a few minutes after taking only one pill. Because of that I came here to buy a bottle of rhodiola. The nutrilite 110 is only 30pills and 110mg but $22.00. After researching I found this which is 250mg of Rhodiola and 60 pills for only $8.00. Thinking I could save money and have better results because of the amount, I was completely wrong. I take 2 pills (500mg)and I can't feel any difference; not even 0.0001%. I don't recommend this brand to anyone. Unfortunately I will have to buy the expensive Nutrilite but at least I know that works."
4,I love it!,"We read quite a few reviews across the internet to find out about this product. They all went on about how much weight they could lose with this vitamin. It can help, but you have to take more than one a day.I take one a day to help me stay motivated and to pick up my metabolism. I have noticed since taking it that I have been able to maintain my weight without having to work too hard. Plus I've gone done a few pounds even when I'm not as faithful about working out. When I do put forth the effort to try to drop weight, it really helps to step up my motivation and metabolism. If you want to see some fast results, you may need to either take more or add a better weight dropper. I use it just to keep my metabolism up because I'm over 40. It helps to do what I use it for.My husband tried them and didn't like them at all. He said that it really didn't help him."
2,Nothing for me,"This product didn't real do anything for me, guess you never know, glad I didn't overpay for this. Maybe your experience will be different."
5,auto pilot 238,"This Blu-ry edition arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. My older sister took me to see this inthe theater when it was first shown. Am I dating myself? The film remains a special effects extravaganza,complements of Ray Harryhausen's magic. The Blu-ray restores its clarity and the wide screen itsdirector's original vision. It's great fun, and you will undoubtedly enjoy this film very very much.And that unforgetable music!!!!!"
3,WIDESCREEN ONLY,This Version Contains Widescreen Only And Does NOT Contain Full Screen Also As Is Advertised ! Video Quality Is As Best As Can Be Expected Given The Quality Of The Original Print. The Film Of Course Is Cinema Magic. Downrated Also Because Of Non Inclusion Of Full Screen Content.
4,High Risk? Yes...yes it is!,"While not Jet Li's best film, this movie breaks taboo's that North American film companies don't have the nerve to break. In the first 10 minutes, a school bus full of children and women gets blown sky high! That's High Risk. The action is over the top, but that's the signature of Hong Kong action, and that's what I love about the genre. If you're tired of the boring, contrived American ""action"" films, definately see this film."
3,Meltdown,"The title makes you think it is going to be a real battle, but all the fighting takes place in a hotel conference/banquet room. Jet Li as always is in fighting mode and takes on the job well. His car maneuver is something to be seen. Well worth watching and enjoying."
1,Isn't this just the movie High Risk,"Isn't this just the movie High Risk, by reading the comments from everybody I'm just wondering if this isn't just it, well if it is this is a piece of crap, compared to some of his other movies, Such as: Fong Sai Yuk, Fist of legend, My father is a hero etc. don't waste your time on this movie, it isn't worth it!!"
4,pretty good...,"I saw this movie a while back...I really liked it. The fight scenes were awsome, When I first this guy 3 years ago. I was saying...It would be awsome if he stared in an American movie."
4,High Risk,"Great film for Jet Li fans.Not a lot of fighting but what there is is classic Jet Li, and worth the viewing.Lots of Hong Kong humor, making it a great film to watch again."
2,"High Risk, indeed","This movie is reputed to be a personal attack against Jackie Chan. Anyone who knows enough about Jackie and his manager, Willie Chan (no relation), can see why this movie has that reputation. I like both Jackie Chan and Jet Li. I bought this movie to see Jet's performance. He was the only good thing in the movie. I cringed whenever Jacky Cheung appeared because his character was too buffoonish. The only enjoyable parts of the movie had Jet. His story-thread was good. The story-thread involving Jacky Cheung was boring and too clownish for me to appreciate. It is as if the director wanted to have two movies in one, but they are too dissimilar to blend together. I don't care that it was designed to make fun of Jackie Chan. I care that it was too silly to accept as 'fun.' Take out the scenes with Jacky and it would be a descent Jet Li movie."

1,What gall Stephen Mitchell has to edit Walt Whitman...,"How can Stephen Mitchell even think of such an abberation - editing Walt Whitman's greatest poem? Sure, there are several versions of the Song of Myself, but if you want to read Whitman, read the original. The first version is the most powerful, and Whitman toned it down over the years, turning it into ""poetry"" rather than his initial burst of enthusiasm. There are several editions of the poem that will let you get the true texts: for example, the Library of America's complete Whitman has both the first version of Leaves of Grass and the ""deathbed"" version, which Whitman revised shortly before his death. There are other versions throughout Whitman's career, as he added poems to the Leaves, and tinkered with existing poems. But this book is a sham. Avoid it."
2,Siempre hay algo que decir,"Documento que tendrá un valor histórico sobre este joven director de orquesta, pero es decepcionante su contenido."
1,1 star because there's no option to give negative stars,"Words cannot describe how bad this album is. The other reviews pretty much say everything. NWOBHM band Iron Maiden came from the same era as Diamond Head, and to this era they were still making good music. It's a shame I can't say the same for Diamond Head, because the two bands were head-to-head early on as far as music quality goes. Another NWOBHM band of the era, Def Leppard, began producing pop music around this time which paled in comparison to their early rock stuff, and their WORST pop music is better than this album! As the other reviewers said there was a live follow-up and it is even worse than this (I know that sounds unbelievable but it's true.) WHY, DIAMOND HEAD?"
4,To Each His Own...,"-Unlike some of the other reviewers down below who expect a band to play the same way they played in 1980, I fully appreciated this CD when I first heard it a few years back. Although I'm a fan of their earlier 80s stuff, I also realize a band has to grow and some of their older fans may not like the direction that a band takes. Fortunately, that's not the case here. Not as far as I'm concerned, anyway.The standout tracks for me are ""Home""; ""Dust""; ""Starcrossed"" and the infectious ""Run"", a track that I have burned onto many hard rock CD-Rs and listen to while cruising down the interstate. It's a track I can't stop listening to.If you're looking for Metallica-like thrash metal, then stay away 'cause it ain't here. If you're looking for melodic hard rock that goes beyond the typical hair metal of the late 80s, then look no further.And as I say to the naysayers, to each his own..."
2,"Great sound quality, but it hurts!","We just got this Stethoscope for our 2 1/2 year old because she had been asking for one. This is a nice Stethoscope, but it really hurts when you put it in your ears! I had read the reviews but figured that maybe the other reviewers were exaggerating. They weren't. I can only put it in my ears for a few seconds and my daughter has not been able to put it in her ears yet. I am going to keep looking for a Stethoscope that does not hurt so much."
4,"Has held up well, does need some adjusting","This was a Halloween prop last year...and has survived the year with a 3 year old. Yes, as other reviewers state it is uncomfortable but the metal is adjustable and can be loosened. Heartbeats are not SUPER loud, but it's safer than over-amplifying sounds."
3,abc reloading,"Who is using equipment from Lee, or part of them, those should buy this book. Inside this book beginner can find basic instruction ***How to reloading *** with Lee stuff.I bought it and after first reading I put it just into shelf and when I am looking some ideas how to improve my reloading usually I grab Speer or Nosler manuals or searching on chatting groups on Internet.Also who is just starting reloader - can find here help."
4,Fountain Pump,"We bought this pump because it's an exact replacement for the pump in our fountain that burned out. This pump has a 16-foot power cord. We needed at least 12 feet, and I couldn't find many pumps that have a cord longer than 6 feet. Be aware that this pump should never be run dry, because it uses the water that flows through it to cool the electric motor. Without this water, the motor will burn up. I found out the hard way."
5,Anyone who wants to know about the Afterlife will do well to study this work!,"Please be sure you have read Part 1 before you attempt this book because it continues on from what was written before. Both volumes constitute the most complete esoteric ruminations on the subject of ""the other side"" that I have read to date. This is a serious work to be undertaken by serious students of esoteric literature. Just phenomenal!"
3,Time will help,"Ok, Knowdaverbs is a dang good emcee, and an excellent storyteller, but this album is not all that good. There are some good songs (my favorite would have to be ""Call of the Dung Beetle"" featuring Bone and Cof from GRitS and Pigeon John from LA Symphony) but for the most part the beats don't hold up to the lyrical standard. That's not to say that the producers aren't good, because they've made beats for GRitS and they've proven that they can hold their own with anyone. I just think that maybe next time, 'Verbs should consider his beats more. Meanwhile, he's one of the best emcees that you've never heard of."
5,the best,knowdaverbs is the best artist that i have! its full of cool songs. he has an amazing talent to write the best christian rap lyrics out there and if i could i would rate it higher because this guy is so tight! he can really rap!
5,A keeper,I bought this movie to replace my original taped version. Another keeper for our Si-Fi collection. A must watch at least once a year. Very entertaining.
5,Look no Further!,"This gate is AMAZING! We purchased this gate to block off the kitchen when our Quadruplets began to crawl. They are now 13 months old and this thing is yanked on beat on kicked, you name it, this thing gets abused. Yet it still functions and stands the same as the day I bought it.<br />I could NOT imagine life without this hands free feature. Its easy for me to open while holding a kid on each hip or carrying bottles out to the feeding area.<br />Push it open with your knee, slam it closed with a push of your leg. Couldnt get any easier!<br />Another plus to this gate is it's height. It is much taller than average gates and is constructed in a way where your little one(s) can't climb over it.<br />We just purchased a new house and will need 4 more gates... we will purchase 4 more of THIS gate for sure!"
5,works great,Even my three and a half year old nephew couldn't figure it out without guidance. It keeps the kids where you want them!
5,absolutely hands free,"We do not have kids, but we have two of these for our dog. It is great because you can be carrying a load of laundry or (I can imagine a child) and still get through the gate easily. You step on the peddle and bump it with your knee and it pops open. It is easy to swing shut as well.It is funny my dog knows how it works and tries to bat his paw at the peddle, but he will not ever be able to open the gate because he cannot put enough pressure down.*******Now that we have children (2 years later) this has proven to be a great gate still. It is in excellent condition and we have purchased 2 additional gates since our son is now walking********"
3,"Excellent gate, but should have a metal foot pedal!","I'm in agreement with most of the other reviewers. The gate is a lifesaver when carrying a child plus groceries, etc. We chose it specifically because it was made of metal. Our dog chewed on all the wooden ones! The only thing wrong with the gate is the plastic foot pedal. Ours too broke off into little pieces after only 3 month of use. I thought we'd gotten a ""lemon"" until I read numerous other reviews stating the same problem. The company is sending a replacement, but after reading that many people are on their 2nd and 3rd pedals, I'm not optimistic! I'd give the gate 5 stars if the pedal was redesigned."
3,Satisfied at first.,"I was satistied with this gate in the beginning. I like the fact that we didn't put holes in the doorway. It was easy for my husband and I to open but, our 8 & 9 year old had a hard time using enough force on the foot pedal. It would stick sometimes. After two months of having it, my husband stepped on the pedal and it broke off on one side. Then the other side broke off when he tried to see if it would still work."
2,If only the foot pedal was more sturdy,"We have been through 2 of these gates now. Both lasted about 3 months each. The problem is the foot pedal. After a while it begins to weaken and eventually it completely breaks off into pieces, leaving the gate unusable. Great while it works. Have taken both back and exchanged them. Also you have to readjust occasionally as it does loosen and slip."
1,Great at first. Only lasted 4 months.,"Not sure how long the many glowing reviewers for this product actually owned the gate before writing their reviews. We had it 4 months and it no longer works without slamming the gate shut. The mechanism on the bottom of the actual gate itself (which is not adjustable, unlike the top) no longer moves smoothly into the gate, allowing the gate to shut. For pennies more The First Years (manufacturer of the gate) could have made a much more robust design that would have lasted for years. Instead they decided to save a few cents per copy and made a defective product, which I unfortunately spent $50.00 on."
3,"If you want to shut a door and use this, not so good!","This is a good gate - very sturdy, easy to open BUT if you put it in a doorway, the foot pedal may NOT allow you to close the door all the way. My husband works at home and needs the door closed! We are using it to keep our 2 yr old OUT of Daddy's home office and I had to adjust it so the door could close with the gate installed. You can tighten it up so it still is firmly installed, but it is not quite as sturdy when done this way. The rubber stoppers have to be partly off the door frame."
5,PERFECT gate for a BUSY mom with full hands!!...,"I have this gate in my hallway upstairs and I love it! Yes the passthrough on the gate is a little smaller then others, but it hasn't bothered me a bit. And, they now are making the mechanics of the foot pedal out of metal and just the covering is plastic. :) We got out of buying the extension kit by going to the lumber yard and getting two scrap 2 x 4 pieces, spraying them white, and putting them on either side inbetween the gate and wall."
4,"Good, but take care when crossing through","Overall, this gate does a good job keeping my son where I'd like him to be, and it's easy to operate. My complaint about it is that my husband bumped it with his leg while going through it and now the gate doesn't like up correctly in the frame anymore. He didn't even hit it very hard, but we just can't get it realigned, and this makes it a little harder to operate. I do wonder if the design may have changed a little because our friends have had the same one for some time and have not had this problem."
4,Wonderful product,"I absolutely LOVE this gate. I was very hesitant to order it at first because I thought the bar at the bottom would be a tripping hazard, but we have had NO problems with it at all. You have to step on the lever to open it anyways, so you are automatically gonna step over it. I really like that it swings both ways, so if my toddler is on one side I can swing it away from her and now have to mover her. We have had no issues with it moving around in the door frame. It is just a wonderful product.I had to give it 4 stars because it did not come with the knee bumper, as is shown in the picture. Apparently there are 2 different kinds of gates that this listing can send, and the one with the arched top (the one we received) doesnt have it. It really doenst affect its use tho. I havent missed it. :)"
5,Worth every penny.,"Just got this for the nursery door. I had it installed in about 15 minutes, and it is very sturdy and operates perfectly. Although right now it is a dog gate to keep the dogs out, and my baby is not even crawling yet, I believe that it will last and function as intended (parents can easily operate, but baby can't). I like the metal construction for the durability, and it is very attractive. I even find it easy to use in the middle of the night when I am half-asleep! I will probably get more for other rooms. I wish my hallway at the stairs were narrower so this would fit there as well."
3,Good for a while...,"I thought this was a great gate, until I realized that it's for toddlers under two. So, when you really need it, it's out-dated. This morning, my 15-month-old put his foot right where I do to open the gate. Now I need another. So, this is a good gate, but it doesn't last long enough. So, I feel it's a waste of money. Buy one that lasts longer. Even if it's more money - you'll only have to buy one once."
3,First Years Gate,Wonderful product for animals but not two-year old children. The two-year old figured out how to open the door repeatedly after studying the mechanism for 20 minutes.
3,"Works well, but was missing tool","The gate works well. I'm using it in a doorless entrance to the laundry room to prevent my cat from entering. I'm sure most cats can jump it, but my cat doesn't.I like that it's pressure mounted so it doesn't leave a mark on the door frame.The foot pedal works well and convenient when carrying items through.cons:The gate is just wide enough for a person to pass through. If you need to carry heavy items through the gate regularly, keep in mind that you might have to lift items above gate to pass through.My gate was delivered without the tool for tightening the brackets. Used wrench instead."
1,HORRIBLE!!,"my husband and i bought this gate to keep our son, who is now 13 months, from crawling over to our coat closet and to keep him from reaching the stairs (bottom not top). this gate first off was a pain to install. the extendable screws kept falling out and moving as i was trying to tighten the gate. and now the gate moves. it is installed over tile floor and it constantly slips and slides when i press the foot pedal. i like that its hands free but it is too much of a pain otherwise for me to really like it."
1,I cut my finger on a sharp metal fastener while installing,"I immediately took it back. It seemed that only one of the metal fasteners was bad, but this was enough for me to not want this brand again. Maybe I just got a bad one, but I would thoroughly inspect this item while you installing."
5,Best gate so far....,"We have many gates in our house and this one by far is the best one. It was very easy to install and use. My daughter loves to swing the gate closed and she hasn't got hurt once, it is a very safe gate for little fingers. Very handy to open with your foot when your hands our full."
4,Love It!,We just bought this gate a couple of months ago to keep our 14 month old son out of the kitchen and getting into the cat food and water. We love the gate as it was easy to install and is very convenient with the gate opening both ways.The only probably we recently found with the gate is that our son gets very upset when we go into the kitchen and he puts his little legs in between the bars. He's gotten his leg stuck in the bars twice already and now has an ugly bruise on the inside and outside of his thigh.Other than that this gate is the absolute best one that we have found!
5,Worth Every Penny!!,"We received one off of our gift registry, and loved it so much we went and bought another!! We've had both for just over a year, and yet to have a problem. Perfect for children and pets!"
3,Didn't work for us.,"I ordered this gate last week and just received it Wednesday. My 2 1/2 year old opened it 5 minutes after it was installed. He stands on the pedal and jumps up and down until the gate pops open. Obviously if we're right there we stop him, but sometimes mom needs a bathroom break. We ended up going to the store to buy a different type of gate. Too bad since on the economy we have to pay in euros. :(Guess this gate is only meant for kids younger than 2 1/2."
1,What a complete piece of junk. Where is the quality control?,"I have never purchased an item that had as many defects as this gate. I bought two, and didn't even bother opening the second one. Three of the four pressure bolts had severe defects in the threads, making them unusable. The foot lock worked ok, but the top was at least an inch and a half from making contact with the brace.I guess everyone else on here got a good one, but to me this is not even worthy of a single star, which I can't do. I also left my feedback on the manufacturer's homepage. 100% unacceptable."
1,Foot pedal breaks and is choke hazard,I love the idea of this gate. It worked great for a few months. But we have had three foot pedals and replacements that have now broken. The gate is made of durable metal but for some reason they chose to make the foot pedal out of flimsy plastic. Not only is this inconvenient to have to keep getting replacement parts IT IS ALSO A CHOKE HAZARD. The supporting plastic breaks off in very small pieces which could easily be swallowed by a small child. If they could just fix the foot pedal issue I would have no problem giving this gate 5 stars!!
5,Love this gate!,I've searched everywhere to find a gate that fits our staircase. The posts are uneven and I've had a ton of difficulty. Anyway this gate is awesome! It's works perfectly!
4,"Love this gate, BUT...","I used this gate at a family member's house, and I loved it, so I bought one for our place. However, it is too small for our normal, standard width hallway. I have to buy the extension for it. It's a great gate, but I think it should be a little wider. I was REALLY looking forward to putting it up and containing my crazy toddler, but now I have to wait on the mail man to bring the extension kit."
2,Fell apart way too quickly,"So we had a little bit of an interesting situation. My husband and I were moving in to my parents' house after they built their house. We were preparing to live in the house about 1 year in advance, which is when I purchased this gate and installed it at my parents' house for when they had my daughter over there. It was barely used for the good part of that year, left open most of the time. Right before we moved in, my daughter ran into the gate (wasn't hurt, thank goodness) but it broke apart. Not only was the outside covered in plastic, the entire hinge was made of plastic! Are you kidding me? That much for a gate and you can't even give me a durable hinge? Sorry, but this was a waste of money!"
2,Mediocre,"This camera take GREAT pictures in the automatic mode, but anytime I try to use the night setting or portrait setting, my pictures don't turn out at all or they are blurred. It's such a shame because the pictures in automatic mode are great."
2,"Bit by the flashing ""H"" ... Canon should trademark it!","We bought this camera a little over a year ago to replace an SLR that became problematic. We've taken it with us on a few vacations and some hikes since then. Because it was much smaller than our old SLR, taking it everywhere was easy. Unfortunately, the photos were never really standouts. It barely beat the performance of a couple throw away cameras we grabbed on trips! I didn't expect professional quality, but the colors were often washed out. Then came the ""H"". Apparently a lot of other Canon Sure Shot and Elph owners have discovered this nasty little flashing error. Like the others we've reset and replaced batteries and cleaned the contacts- to no avail. The camera is dead. I would HIGHLY DISCOURAGE THE PURCHASE OF SURE SHOT CAMERAS... Don't just take my word for it. Read the reviews of the previous camera models in the Sure Shot line."
5,"What's behind me, she's not important!","What's not to like... classic cars, Raul Julia, a road race, Raul Julia... did I mention Raul Julia? Much better than any of the competitors like Cannonball Run."
3,Item great - shipping not,"Item was the exact movie I wanted. However the case the DVD came in was broken when I opened it. Since it was a gift, I did not have time to return it and get a new one. Ask the shipping department to use a little more care in packaging items."
4,"Gumball Rally, Rally Fun!","This is a fun, enjoyable movie with great car chases, hot women (in a haystack), fab cars, and memorable scenes like the flasher who flashes the police and Gary Busey's quote ""I can smell the Queen Mary's ... from here"" (referring to the end of the race). This movie (for those who are too young or don't remember) was promoted by giving out buy-one-ticket-get-one-free coupons that were attached to a package of 5 gumballs with cars marked on them. If you like cars and laughing you'll like this movie."
1,Not worth the watch,It was a very slow movie. Was expecting alot more like Cannon Ball Run. Not even close. Get Cannon Ball Run a much more entertaining movie and more laughs.
5,Laugh after laugh after laugh,"Ok, I'm going to stay clear of all the quality issues of this DVD, as with previous reviews, the colour bleeding in some scenes is awful, but lets consider this movie came from a very old school analog world into the digital era & just live with it. The movie itself is a flipping hoot. Anybody who loves cars & really silly movie lines just has to love this movie. Best line of the movie ??? - has to be the ""what's in your rear view mirror does not concern you"" one ... & I'm sorry, but I just have a real soft spot for Ferrari's of 'ol which had a gated shifter cause you actually had to know how to shift etc & any serious Ferrari die hard fan ordered any generation of Ferrari with a gated shifter & strait cut gears ... but I won't get on my soapbox about paddle shifters etc ... let's just watch this movie & laugh ... after all ""it's America"" :-) just watch the movie & pay attention to the ending & you'll get the joke ... love this movie ..."
2,Goldclinker. Disappointing.,"I thought it would be fun to see a Bond movie. Mostly, I've only seen parts of movies on the tv when i was a kid. The movie started out pretty well, with modest intrigue and pacing as it presented the Bond gadgets and women. However, the second half really drags and is just one non-sequiter after another. I mean, there's supposed to be a litte suspense and cleverness, right? Of course, the movie is not about plot, but after awhile the bone head script is really annoying. Also, the movie feels dated, the action is slow and cheesy, and it's shot in a very clunky and dull style. Just like the duck on Sean's head in the opening sequence, this one is for the birds!"
4,007 Goldfinger,"I own all 007 DVD's and have been switching to Blu-ray, so far I am inpressed with the results. The Blu-ray of Goldfinger is better then DVD."
5,"""Congratulations on your promotion, Goldfinger. Are you having lunch at the White House too?""","The Bond film that really set the style of most of the films that would follow: gadgets, gimmicks in aces. At under two hours -- the best Bonds generally are -- it moves at a lightning pace from the pre-credits sequence to the battle at Fort Knox. Sean Connery gives an assured performance as 007, Gert Frobe (who really didn't speak a lick of English) perfect as Auric Goldfinger, Harold Sakata as Odd-Job sets the standard for future henchmen and Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore -- probably the best female lead in any 007 film. At 37 she was the oldest femme fatale in the series history. A great John Barry score and Robert Brownjohn's last title sequence -- from THUNDERBALL until LICENCE TO KILL those chores would return to Maurice Binder. On the downside, Cec Linder is WAY TOO OLD to be Felix Leiter -- Jack Lord failed to reappear when he demanded as much money as Connery was receiving."
5,Wonderful!,I have seen all of the James Bond movies and I still think that Goldfinger is the best. This movie is the classic Bond and I wish more were made like it.
5,Goldfinga... have some pie won't you?,"I just saw this movie last night on tv and I had seen pieces of it through the years... like the other James Bond stories but it's still over my head although for some reason it's still my favourite movie that may say a lot about me but may say more about you.I'm ordering the DVD from Amazon here and can't wait at the price it's going for... I may just buy the whole bunch that is to say Bond, James 007 starring Sean Connery.It's about this guy that gets an idea into his head and won't take no for an answer so he plans to rob the US for all of it's gold and then it gets a little beyond me but I'm sure somebody could get hurt nonetheless.Great color and acting and stars and all that but even so it's just a movie and I think the staff did their job well to put out a product that satisfies the curious.Translated by Won WonVictoria BC"
5,james bond,i love watching james bond movies and its a good pass time when im at homevat nite and wanting to relax
3,Titanic,"I bought this movie out of curosity. It is full of propaganda, and not at all factual in terms of the Titanic, but interesting considering it was done during the war. Not released by the Germans due to the violence of the sinking. Odd considering the death camps etc.. An interesting movie, and as we are learning German, worth the cost."
4,Crazy propaganda! A must-have for history buffs.,"This strange film has an incredible history and is mesmerizing for those interested in wartime propaganda... in this strange version of the TITANIC tragedy, a lone German officer stands against the evil British empire who condemns the passengers to a watery grave because of their national lust for power and profit. Wait til you get a load of the Oompah orchestra on deck playing a march to cheer the doomed passengers!The special features, especially the tour of the sister ship OLYMPIC, are also interesting.Kino always puts great care into the passion of film preservation."
1,zero stars of five,"This product was ordered but after 25 days still hadn't been received. The freight tracking showed it had made it to a town 30 miles away but it never got any closer in two weeks. I had to cancel the order, the replacement wouldn't ship out for two more weeks (backordered) so I declined to re-order."
2,Don't Buy this Till Part 2 Comes out,I feel ripped off!!I just re-read 3 books to enjoy #4 - and all I got was 3 1/2!!I read other series (like Jordan and Goodkin) - there are better ways to end a book; everything is hanging and now I will wait 2 years for the next installment. And that will not even continue what this book started - so 4 years to find out about Arya and Brienne?!?!I have already downgraded from hard-covered to paperback. Now I will downgrade till the story finishes.GREAT STORY - UNPROFESSIONAL EDITING - UNFAIR TO THE READERS!!.
3,Enough already!,"I love a great, long, drawn out story more than most people, but enough already! I have the first four books in this series, but I won't be buying any more...unless I see that the author has drained his last inkwell on this particular subject."
4,An Excellent Book,"This is another great book in the ASOIAF series. I am reading it again for the 2nd time and I like it much more this time around than the first. Of course we all want to read about our favorite POV characters (Tyrion, Jon Snow, Dany, etc.) but this book is still very interesting and fun. Not as exciting as the other books but still very solid. Samwell's story is very interesting and so is the Iron Born story. The parts at King's Landing are a bit dry but they end wonderful. I just hope GRRM finishes the next book soon. It's killing me and a lot of other people too."
1,"Very bad book, very bad sequel","I dont know why anyone would read this book and think its ""good"". It totally IGNORES the main characters that were set and introduced in the first 3 books. The queen targaryn in the south, Bran, Rickon, John Snow, Tyrion, and so many more. Where are their points of view that solidified the first 3 books in the first place?How do you go from forming a emotional attachment between the reader and the characters the author introduces as main characters and totally, TOTALLY devoids this fourth book of their presences after 4 years of waiting? Seriously is this author hemorraging from some kind of brain disfunction?I'm at exactly 1/2 way through the book now and I'm so disgusted with it that I will most likely not finish it. I seriously wish I could get a refund for this garbage."
4,Good read,"The book and this series, has been a good read, good story, and entertaining, although the story seems to be a bit long and drawn out. Capitalism has its price does it not (more books more money)? The series far surpasses its counter parts in the same genre such as the authors of the ""Wheel of Time"", and Terry Goodkind. I found them to be tedious and boring to be honest with you. I do not understand people's fascinations with that type of writing; then again, some people think that Steven King is a good author."
2,Does not add one bit to the story,"Let me begin with the disclaimer that both me & my wife thoroughly enjoyed reading the first three books. We were really looking forward to an enjoyable & exhilarating book 4. But alas - what a disappointment !!!Martin seems to have to written this book for only one apparent reason - revenue; he deliberately skirts progressing the real story, instead focusing on side-stories & lesser characters. Tyrion & Daenerys are NOT EVEN mentioned. Arya, Sansa, Catelyn, Jon's stories hardly develop with non-nonsensical side plots engulfing them.The author even blatantly admits avoiding the real story in the end with the excuse that ""he did not to avoid the story of the other lesser important people"".As a reader though, it left us frustrated - reading the book for over a month it felt a tremendous waste of time.We are in two minds to pick up book 5.In sum our advise - skip this book completely; you will not have missed the main story a bit...."
3,Some explaining to do,"Some day I would like to see the editor who decided it was too expensive to produce this book correctly get up and explain their position to fans at a science fiction and fantasy convention complete with Excel charts and annotated business Powerpoints. I would like to see them talk their way out of the riot that would ensue. I would like to hear them explain why five years later with the series in tatters, and word of mouth and memory soured, and Martin obviously unsure how to continue based on how they damaged his structure - how exactly was it worth it again? Because of ancillary rights like posters and calendars and TV shows? Because I'm pretty sure when the series does appear again, the sales will be halved, and these same editors who probably work somewhere else now, will be pointing to this fact and saying, See? That's why they didn't want to produce it correctly. Good going!"
2,Chumpmenudo,"Wow, big let down, lots of words, little action of interest, lost the thread of who I thought were the main characters....should have focused the story to ready us for the final installment, but instead, diluted the story to the point where I don't see how it can now be concluded to our satisfaction."
3,Too much padding,Love these books but starting to be like wading through a swamp and getting nowhere. Overyl padeed out. i dont think Martin wants the books to ever end and so the story is just going on and on .
5,Amazing book!,"Another great book in the ""a song of ice and fire series"". The story keeps getting better and better. Buying the fifth book immediately!"
1,Something beautiful gone horribly wrong,"The first three books in the series were absolutely wonderful. This one was awful. Way too much information! Our small, compact world is blown completely open. Martin definitely did not bother to edit this one. And it shows. Oh, does it show. I thought the first three books were incredible. This one is a piece of junk. Don't read it! You'll not only be saving yourself time, you'll save yourself the potential agony of seeing a series you loved utterly ruined."
2,Slowly Going Nowhere,"Ok the overly wrought descriptions of everything make this book drag on and on and...well you get it. I eagerly devoured the first three books and was so excited to get A Feast, but man is it disappointing. I find myself skimming through much of the Iron Island plot and sadly miss hearing more about Tyrion and Dany. I understand Martin is trying to weave a rich tapestry of the different kingdoms and is gradually introducing us to all of the houses and their individual trials and tribulations but this book is often times boring and tedious. The journey or quest of these characters is tiresome and while the formula worked well for the last three books (partly I think, because the characters were likable and at times deplorable and Martin would hit you with three or four plot twists at a time) these characters and these journeys are annoying. I can understand conceptually why he explains everything in such detail but it is starting to read like a text book."
2,A Feast for Crows leaves crumbs for the reader,"The Song of Ice and Fire has turned to glacial ice and a fizzle.I could not stop reading the first three books, but this turned into slow moving minor characters fully centered on side events and blundering, I mean political manuevering. While it is good that GRRM has worked on fully developing his fantasy, does he really have to tell us every stupefying detail? I know many like neverending soap operas and will like what has turned into a soap opera fantasy, but GRRM has almost lost the rest of us. The characters in the earlier books that died were heartbreaking (or satisfying if they were villians), but in this book, I was wishing for their demise and disappointed that GRRM did not kill off enough of them."
2,Addendum for book 3?,"George R. R. Martin is one of the best authors of fiction at this time. However book 4 entirely lacks the pacing and reason for being found in books 1 thru 3. This volume does not cohere. It is a discursion that is not that interesting and does not further the grand plot. I also feel disappointed at the wait involved, as I discovered I had forgotten some of the previous material. I hope book 5 gets back on track, and resumes the blistering pace of the first three books!"
2,A Feast for Crows,"More characters introduced. Little follow-up on The Wall or other ""left hanging"" situaions like the two younger sons (Wolf) or the animals themselves. It's time to start wrapping it up, and putting all the pieces together for me! Insofar as Kindle goes -- it is difficult to go back to the pages which list characters and relationships and then return to your reading page. I am holding off on reading book 5."
2,Utterly disappointed,"The first three books in this series were top notch and I pre-ordered Feast for Crows with high anticipation. Martin really disappoints his fans in this one. While he has said that this book was necessary to prevent a huge novel from emerging, the majority of the book I found boring in the extreme and found myself skimming forward to my favorite characters chapters. The Arya chapters are the only ones that I found kept me enraptured like I was throughout the first three novels. I have been diappointed in other long series before. Robert Jordan's encyclopedic series is an excellent example of a really good story that the author murders by trying to extend the story to generate more books (and $) at the cost of the reader (I will never read Jordan again). I really hope that Martin does not follow the same road."
3,"Not the best,, but not bad","This book took me FOREVER to finish. Not that it wasn't interesting, but I had a hard time ever reading more than two chapters at a time...then I might go days without picking it up.That being said, I still enjoyed it. The plot does progress a little, and we do get insights into characters that we haven't gotten them from in the past.I am in this series for the long haul. I'm looking forward to the next entry."
3,What happened?,"I truly loved the first three books and looked forward to the release of this one. I was sooooo disappointed. I found it to be an o.k. read but it certainly lacked the luster of the first three. I can only hope he is setting up for major things to come in the next one. But if the next one is as bad as this one, so be it I will just have to wash my hands of GRRM.""I really hated the introduction of the new characters without being properly updated with ALL of the characters the first three books were about, and several of the original characters were barely mentioned""Last but not least ""WHERE'S THE DRAGONS?"""
2,2 stars for Brienne,Amazingly enough one of the characters in this series that has caught my affection is Brienne. If it weren't for her then this book would be a total wash.One word to describe it. Boring
2,So disappointed after LOVING the first 3,"I don't know that there is much to say that hasn't already been said in other reviews. While reading the first 3 books, I hated putting them down. When I did, I felt anxious to pick them back up feeling like I had ""left something behind"". I read the first 3 in less then a month. I have now been reading this book for over a month and it feels like a chore to pick it up and read it. I don't understand how such a wonderful series of books could take such a nosedive. I am debating on whether I even want to read the 5th. What a letdown!"
1,A disaapointment after the third three,"It was near impossible to put the book down during the the first three books but the fourth one it was hard to pick it up because there was hardly any intrigue, story or that feeling of what happens next. I don't think it was because of the missing characters (though they are sorely missed throughout the book), its also the way the story was told that changed. In the first three books, I would excitedly wait for the next time the story was being told by a particular character but would get so consumed by the next character that wouldn't even mind if the previous character didn't emerge for numerous chapters. Maybe Mr. Martin killed the intriguing characters too quickly/abruptly and had to do with fillers in this one. I just hope the next one is not as bad."
1,Skip it and wait for the next one,"Oops. Martin has Robert Jordan syndrome. They lost their fans back in book 3. These guys must love hearing themselves write. Too bad the plot got lost in all the words, I was really hoping for more.There are way too many details on secondary characters, and not enough broadening of the main characters (half of which aren't even present in the book). It is too mentally exhausting to put forth enough effort to try and keep all of them straight in my head, because they add no value to the plot. I know, I know, the story about the books split in two. Bad idea.Skip this book and you'll have missed nothing that advanced the story. Let's hope for more with Book 4, A Dance With Dragons."
2,"The ""soap opera installment"" for the series A Song of Ice and Fire","I've heard it said that you can quit watching a daytime soap opera for a couple of months and come back and pick right up where you left off without missing much. A Feast for Crows accomplishes just that. The first three books in this series were fantastic, fast paced and shocking in every chapter. The last four or five chapters of this book sum it up and contain everything you'll need to know for upcoming books. I was glad to finally finish the book.The story gets hard to follow because there are so many characters that are only briefly introduced, then glossed over. So much of what is said, is just fluff and really doesn't have anything to do with the story. I hope the next book in the series shows more promise or I doubt I'll even bother with it."
3,"No, this is not what we hoped for...","Well. What can i say? After reading the book i wasn't realy disapointed. It is still Martin's magic way of writing, but i think he lost his perspective. I don't think it was a good idea to split this novel. It just doesn't answer many questions that were made in first three novels, and its frustrating. It would have been much better to include all the characters and give them little less time. But there is one more thing, Martin has developed so many characters that its nearly impossible to put them all in one book, and still make it under 1000 pages. Now, i dont complain of him making so many characters, its just that this novel serie is looking cripled right now and thats not satisfying to anyone. Martin has a great power of making chatracters real, but with this sequence he lost tension in the storyline, and for that, i give three stars. And it would have been an easy 5 star novel. Bad mistake."
5,This book indicates my progress through the series,Reading each book has made me useless for the daily chores. I cannot keep the book down once I get over the first 4 chapters and got the momentum going.
4,feast review,"Started watching on HBO, book is much better helps explain the histories and relationships in the series. Great to buy the grouping so you can keep reading along to the next adventure."
3,Good but Ahhhh!,"I found this very slow and hard to get into until about half way. Even then it left me frustrated with detailed story lines that seemed to end in nothing, but still it's great journey."
4,Good addition to the series,"I really liked the first three books and was excited to move on to the fourth. Before buying the fourth book, I read some of the reviews and started to wonder if I was going to be wasting my time. I figured I should give the book a chance and form my own opinion. After finishing the book, I realized that I had no idea what all the negative reviews were talking about. Sure it wasn't quite as action-packed as the first three books and it introduced some new unfamiliar characters, but overall I liked it. I thought it was worth reading and am excited to move on to the fifth book. If you are on the fence about it, I say give it a chance."
1,Kindle,"Why is this book NOT available for Kindle? I know several others who've downloaded it in the past, but it now is not available for US customers?"
2,Was this book really necessary?,"I loved ""A Game of Thrones,"" ""Clash of Kings,"" and ""A Storm of Swords,"" but while reading ""Feast"" I started to get...bored. And in my growing boredom, I asked myself: Why is this series so long? Why does Martin need seven huge novels to tell a story he could easily tell in four? Basically Martin's been writing the same story since the first novel, and I hate the addition of new houses and characters in Feast. They detract from the story and merely add to Martin's growing list of near one hundred characters. This is a prime example of something good that's gotten out of hand, just like Hollywood sequels. The superficial need to extend a story destroys the original and much loved effect of the first novel and leaves the reader with an unsatisfying end to what could be an awesome epic. Let's trim the fat here, Martin, and get back to leaner, meaner storytelling."
2,Much ado about nothing,"Martin has fallen into the worst tendency of fantasy writers--writing too many words about characters and events that are not interesting to read about in the first place. This book deals with minor characters that keep getting introduced, and worse, nothing actually happens throughout the book. Most chapters can be taken out/skipped without losing anything. I myself got bored and stopped reading half way through the book. I definitely will not be getting the next book either because it looks like Martin has come to value quantity over quality."
3,The Weaker Half... I Hope,"It's like all the characters you don't actually like - together! Sure, we get to see bad things happen to the Stark girls (but not quite bad enough to be notable), and the fruits of Cersei's labors, but by dividing up the 4th book into two halves, i think Martin made the mistake of leaving out the more charismatic people. Where's Tyrion and John Snow, basically? Even Stannis or Danerys? I can't imagine anyone was waiting with baited breath for the continuing story of whatever the name of the ugly knight chick was, but here we get it.... over and over (and leading to an event that should please nobody). By the time I was through, Jaime had somehow become the most compelling still-alive character, which, while an accomplishment, is hardly a triumph."
2,Over-rated series,"I started with the first book and got hooked by the setting, although the constant shifting from one character to another became annoying. I read the second and third, although the series became depressing (with everyone dying almost) and the alternate chapters of characters becoming more annoying as it became increasingly difficult to remember where the story left off with each succeeding character. The third book actually became rather boring but I ordered the fourth book anyway as some of the characters were interesting enough to want to find out what happens, although the slaughter of Robb and Catelyn was truly depressing. Finally, half way through the fourth I gave up and quit reading as I really didn't care what happened to the characters anymore and the individual plots were more and more diverging. I felt like George R R Martin seemed to have lost the thread of the original premise of his series and was just extending the plots to make more books."
3,Eh,"I adore the firs three book and had to get this one to find out what happens in the story. This book is clearly not on the same level as the first three. It's a necessity if you're a fan of the series but don't get your hopes up - it only contains half the characters' stories and way too much about the Greyjoys... I'm also getting uncomfortable with the gratuitous sexual violence against women. I know there is war going on but really - we can be spared the graphic details about an assault on a 12 year old without missing out on anything. Just the hint of something like that is horrific and abominable to all - no need to go into details, repeatedly.I miss Danaerys."
1,Marginally connected to first 3 books,"I'm shocked at how little this book has to offer.Let me sum it up for you....you do not know or care about most of the characters in this book, they are new, boring, not relevant to the story, boring, seem to be shoe-horned into the series for no apparent reason...and did I mention Boring?Can't tell you what happened in the last quarter of the book, I tossed it!I rarely fail to finish a book, its an odd twist in my personality, I have to finish!Could'nt swing it here.The first 3 are some of the most amazing Fantasy I have ever read, Loved them.This one is nonsense.Ill wait for Book 5....but Ill wait till I hear some reader reviews, if its more of the same, I'm sorry to say i'll have to be done with my one of favorite authors.Just skip this book.....seriously.""Nothin' to see here, keep moving, Nothin to seee!"""
2,Mediocre,"Please, let's be honest. This book had 80% less compelling content and sophistication then the previous three books. GRRM's prose is becoming verbose, redundant, and therefore boring. It's as if he wanted to extend the series to seven books for his publishers, not his art. GRRM's three prior books were completely outstanding in every area of literature.It is my hope that he does not fall into the 'Robert Jordan' syndrome. Instead of expanding his already excellent characters, he chose to lengthen this book, by creating more mediocre characters, with little or no true relevance to increase or forward the story.Remember, from his very own website, his initial intention was to write four or five books.I agree with his first assumption."
4,Not sure how this ended up in the humor section...,"This book truly does not deserve all the bad reviws it's been getting. Every book in the series has been phenomenal, although even though it doesn't really make sense to say it's the worst book in the series, one could still say it's the least good. Nonetheless, the book is a much better read for any fantasy fan than half the stuff people read now anyways."
3,Not as good as the rest of the series,This book wasn't as good as the others in this series. It seemed to drag and I skimmed through a lot of the dialog. It was harder for me to pick up on who some of the characters were and I ended up going back and forth a lot.
4,Not Bad,"Would have liked for it to have picked up where the third book ended, but instead it is a bunch of new charcters, and it goes a long time without hearing from characters you read so much about during the first three books. Pace and action pick up half way through"
3,Agree with others,"this book suffers greatly from bloating. although i've really enjoyed the series, this volume is indulgent on the author's behalf - not much of anything happens, despite the hundreds and hundreds of pages. also, the tone is sometimes facetious, making the reader feel a little duped. some serious editing is required, as both this and the previous volume, also edited, could have been published as one. he needs to just get to it already!"
2,Slog,"Man, something happened to George's editors between this book and the last. As much as I enjoy the rich detail and depth of character in this series I found that I had to power through large sections of this book, hoping that it would get better. A great deal of time was spent attempting to develop characters that just weren't very interesting. After reading interminable chapters of Sansa/Alayne I still don't care about her.This book wasn't bad, it was just too damn long. It was also a terrible disappointment coming on the heels of book 3 which was excellent. It would have benefited from some aggressive editing, and books 4 and 5 should have remained a single volume."
2,A Self-Indulgent Waste of the Reader's Time,"Well, you've got to read this one to get to the next one but it's not pleasant. It seems like about 80% of this book is devoted to mind-numbingly boring discussions, by people sitting in castles, of how some people are related to other people. This was probably necessary in the author's mind, to keep everything straight, but it is just torture for the average reader. Just get on with it already. Almost nothing happens in the first 600+ pages. Finally, in the final 100 pages or so, the plot moves along with some significant developments and, we hope, this will lead to some action in the next volume. We hope."
3,Eh....,"While the previous books in this series had me glued, this one I had absolutely no problem putting down. It just isn't as interesting, suspenseful nor entertaining as the ones before. Too many new characters, too much going on, scattered storyline, nothing or nobody to ""root"" for. I forced myself to finish it and although I REALLY want to love the next one (Dance with Dragons), from what I read in the reviews it's more of the same. Perhaps the author is looking to extend the storyline to keep the tv series going? I'm not sure what happened here, all I know is that it's lost the power that existed in the first few books. I believe this series has ""jumped the shark""."
5,Great Book!,The book continues with the rest of the series very well. I enjoyed reading it and am currently reading book 5.
1,"Off the rails, self indulgent","This book was ponderously slow, and a whole entire story arc should have just been cut (think; the Iron men). That arc should have been just mentioned in passing. Really lame compared to the rest of the series.also martin must have fun out of ideas, because half the book is literally just describing different tortures, rapes, sex, nipple sizes and colors, etc. Come on dude."
3,"Rather give me half of everyone's story than this anti-climatic ""full story of half the characters""","The author said he'd rather tell the whole story for half the characters than half the story for all the characters...Well, nice idea on paper...but in practice it turn out to be an extremely boring idea...You end up with page after page, chapter after chapter of the same 5 or 6 characters...it gets really boring after a while...to the point where I was actively wishing for characters to just die already!I'm dreading the next book. As I think it will be much of the same.What makes large fantasy series fun is experiencing events through the eyes of multiple characters, almost simultaneously. This book does not do that."
4,One of the top 3 series I've ever read,"A song for fire and Ice is honestly a great read, despite it's 600+ pages. Normally I wouldn't want to read a book that is so long, they tend to become cumbersome and dull, but I'm never bored reading these and i usually can't wait until the next installment. To anyone out there that loves to read, you should give this series a go!please visit me at BookDevour@blogspot.com"
2,"Strike four, five, six and well, you know..","Did you ever have to write a term paper of a certain length and you kept stretching to make it? That's what GRRM seems to have done with the 4th in his Fire and Ice series. It's short on story and entertainment and long (very long) on padding (that I didn't care about - and I bet you won't either). The first three books were fun to read. This one, which will be my last, was a chore (and a bore).Do you think he did it for the money? Cause for sure, the guy can write - he proved it with three in a row. But this one was a swing and a miss, and a swing and a miss, and ..."
2,Disappointing,"I can't believe it took him five years to write that. All fluff and very little story. I was so looking forward to this book, now I am not so eager to see the next one."
3,A feast for Crows,"The last book in a series of four by R.R. Martin. The series is very good, however takes attentive listening."
3,Great addition to the series,"But what is wrong with this guy? Why is he taking so long between books? Another 3 or 4 year wait is NOT worth it. He will lose the fans he's got for no reason other than his procrastination. 5 star book, but 2 points off for the delay. And yes, I bought it the first week it came out along with everyone else, that's the only reason he was on the best-seller list, not because of any 'staying power' in that list.Otherwise it was a great continuation of the various story lines. Some of it was obvious from the first book (the Jon Snow and Arya stories), the Cersei bits were also well-written and Tyrion will wait till the next book. Just so long as it does not take another 3-4 years!!! Please!Addendum in 2011 - So now he has the excellent TV show but it still is taking way too long - 6 years between novels in a series - whew! Maybe by 2030 he'll be done."
1,Could not finish,"There is not a lot that I can say about this book that so many others have not already said. Nothing major really happens in this book to advance the overall story of the series. We get a view of Martin's world through the eyes of a bunch of characters that I really didn't find interesting nor important.I actually stopped listening about 1/3 of the way through and read the synopsis on Wikipedia to see if there was anything interesting that I might have missed. There wasn't.While his character POV style is interesting, the non-linearity of this technique is downright annoying in this book. Brienne's search for Sansa that goes on and on and on and on (while the reader already knows she's safe and sound elsewhere) was absolutely mind-numbing.I finally gave up and moved on to another book. I am currently listening to ""A Dance with Dragons"" and, it is slightly better than this one, however, it is no where near as good as the first books in this series. I fear that the author has lost it."
3,700-odd pages of not much happening,"I was anxiously awaiting this book for years, then found myself having to drag myself through it once it arrived. I suppose after the cataclysms and upheavals of the previous installment this one was doomed to have a slower pace and more fragmented nature. But I really didn't expect the feeling of having to drag myself through it - and still, at the end, very little has advanced or been resolved. A Storm Of Swords kept me up all night; Feast put me to sleep early."
4,Game On,"The story has grown in scope. In this installment of ASOIAF series we are introduced to the world beyond the Wall, Dorne and the Free Cities across the sea. This book in particular requires a re-read to identify the many story line clues and predictions that GRRM has left for us. GRRM has invented a rather fun and interesting game that engages the reader. I like it !!"
4,Feast of Crows a defense,"I saw lots of 1s and 2s for reviews, so I decided to offer my review. You cannot skip this book. It is necessary to know what is going on in the overall storyline. Perhaps this is Mr. Martin's weak link, but it is still action packed and has plenty of folks who we know and love or know and hate in it."
2,Not on the same level as the rest,"So granted, the writing is still great and the overall plot is still thickening. No loss of interest there.The thing that bugs you in this part is how slow the events are moving... the message George leaves at the end kind of clarifies this a bit, and you go like: ohhhh ok! But still, the chapters feel so much longer and the story moves at a drastically slow pace.The characters focused on here are relatively ""new"" and you feel like you don't have a strong connection to them as you did to the previous ones!"
2,So Sad,Disappointing and boring. If you're interested in what's happening with your favorite characters from the first three books don't look here. Chapter after chapter of new characters introduced who add nothing to the continuation of the story and GRRM fails miserably in making any of them interesting enough to want to read about.I kept going to other books and coming back to this one in hopes it would get better. It never did. The book simply goes nowhere.
5,Underrated,I love this whole series and I'm always surprised when people say this is their least favorite. It is beautifully written and has a poetic subtlety that makes Martin the great writer he is. My favorite of the series.
3,Book 4 is long and drawn out,"This is my least favorite book so far in the series. JRR Martin take a long, drawn out journey with nothing major happening to characters that we love in this series. If you can just get through it, it is ultimately worth it just to continue to be in the world he has created."
3,Good and Bad,Some aspects of the book seemed long and somewhat pointless. At times the book with its twists and plots kept me as interested as his first novels in this series although certainly not as engaging.
1,Glad to know I'm not alone,What a disappointment. When did Martin become pen pals with Jordan???I'm hoping that in 2011 (when Martin will get around to releasing the next one!) he'll put a plot outline together so I don't have to remember 25+ characters that will probably die for no reason anyway.I would not suggest reading this book unless you have trouble sleeping. It's a much better substitute for Nyquil!
2,I'm afraid Martin has lost his magic touch.,"This book compensates me for all the sleep I've lost over the previous, wonderful, books. It is a wonderful replacement for any sleeping pills you might need - dull, extremely slow and focuses on all the wrong (i.e. boring / annoying) characters."
1,terrible...,"Such a let down after the epic third book. iA thousand pages and nothing actually happens? theres definitely an art to thatHad to fight to finish the book, and hearing that the 5th book is more of the same really makes me not want to continue this series and just wait for the 5th season on HBO."
4,Feast For Crows,"I agree that this book was Slower then the rest, however that doesn't mean that it wasn't just as important to the overall story. I get it. I've read the reviews and I almost didn't read this one after some of what I read, but so far I can't say that I was Disappointed. I believe that there is a method to the madness that we all soon will understand in books to come! I love the story enough to read them all and I have Faith in our author that he will not disappoint his readers! Like I said it was a bit slower but well worth the read IMO!"
1,Boring,"This book goes nowhere slowly. We know where the characters left off at the end of book 3 and by the end of this book it feels as if nothing happened. There is the usual character death, political intrigue and general plot movement, but when the last page turns you have to ask 'How are things different now than when I started' and the answer is 'not very different'."
3,Not that bad...or that good,"OK, I delayed reading this until GRR finally said Dance would be coming out because he said that would be the 2nd half of a very big book, and I'm glad. The book drags compared to the previous three, making it a weak addition to a strong series. I found the story engaging ... even though not much happens. I think the moral of the story here is that life is full of disappointments. Hooray for Lady Stoneheart. Jaime Lannister becomes one of the most interesting characters, Brienne a copy and paste sideline. And that nasty Cersei is up to her usual wickedness. Fear really is the mind killer. Petyr Baelish is still an interesting bad guy, but this book really lacks progress in his story and Sansa's. Has a few funny lines in it. Just an OK book, I don't hate myself for picking it up. (It does seem like daytime drama with a kick sometimes.)"
1,the magic is gone,This book definitely was not worth the wait. I wish he would just hire Brandon Sanderson to finish the series.
1,Very dissapointing,"The decision to split the trilogy and make it 3a and 3b was certainly the worst I have ever seen. The story plot is not advancing at the same speed than 1 and 2 and the book as it is right now is just boring. Even worse, although Martin promised to publish 3b soon after the 3a release, he is not even close to finishing up.This must be a debacle from the editor/publisher point of view, whoever did not convince him to make it a straight trilogy had more dollar signs in his eyes than the reader in mind. I will certainly not buy the next book. I am deeply dissapointed that such a great storyline and interesting characters are dying this way....."
2,Some Meandering Pastiches for Crows,"Whereas the first three ""Song of Ice and Fire"" books hurtle breathlessly forward, each chapter fundamentally changing the world and our understanding of it, ""Feast for Crows"" takes the meandering-pastiche route. Instead of nail-biting cliffhangers, chapters tend to end on notes like this one, which I just made up:Cersei looked at the dress. Her lips curled upward in a wicked smile. ""Fetch my seamstress. Have her take this in at the waist."" The girl nodded meekly, retreating from the Queen's chambers. ""And one more thing."" The poor thing turned, trembling like a reed in the summer wind. ""Have her let the hem out a little. I want it more... swooshy.""Other riveting scenes include:* Jaime taking a dump.* Samwell removing a pickle from his sandwich.* Brienne chancing upon her childhood idol, the Knight of Cheeses, on the King's Road, and getting his autograph.* Sansa getting her wisdom teeth out.* Arya trying on hats."
3,when is this ever ending?,"I'm not reading anymore of these books because they seem to stop the character development and will never come to an end!Please, Mr. Martin, finish this story!!"
4,Get on with it,"Just finished book four. Not as excited with it as with the first three. Too many cliffhangers left unresolved, unlike the other books. Still fascinating, just not quite as good as the others."
1,More than a little disappointing,"Mr. Martin has no regard for his fan base does he expect readers to sleep through 800 pages of boring, uneventful, characters just so we'll buy then next book? Well not so Mr. Martin, I've completed the trilogy in my mind already and created the resolution for the characters on my own. I don't need you any more but thanks for the beginnings of a good story."
2,Not Worth the Wait,"Sadly, not worth the wait. Disjointed plot lines are hard to follow after two or three years between books. Nothing seems to start to happen until after page 300."
3,I miss Roy Dotrice,"This isn't about the book - this is about the audiobook. I listened to all 3 until FfC and absolutely LOVED Roy Dotrice. I was used to Jim Dale's style, but of course Dotrice is more grownup. Anyway, I started Feast for Crows, and this very pleasant-voiced narrator is very very appropriate to Young Adult fiction. I miss Dotrice's gravelly voice."
3,Not the best in the series,"Should've went ahead and wrote half the story using all the characters! I mean...this book was extremely hard to read at times. Hated almost all the chapters except for Jaime, Cersei, and well....that's about it. Kinda looking forward to Dance with Dragons now. KiNDA"
3,Where is the good,"As with all of the books in this series, I would prefer if the author restrained his use of casual profanity. Call me a prude. Still, I have obviously enjoyed the series or I wouldn't have persisted through the first four volumes. What upsets me about this chapter is the great lack of anything positive. Taken as a standalone, this would be a serious depressing book. Even in the context of a many volume series, it is difficult to see anything positive. I'm a glass almost full kind of guy, but this volume was still very difficult to read at times."
2,Love the book series just not this book,I have enjoyed the first three books. This book lost me midway. I keep going back to it hoping the further along I get I will become more interested in the storyline.
3,Mixed feelings,For a book I thought would never end I was really kind of sad when it did. Not that I enjoyed it as much as the first three in the series but because I was hoping before it ended that it would have taken me somewhere I wanted to go with the story but sadly it never did and now I need to push on to the other half of the book which is book number five. So hoping book five is more fulfilling than this book but I have read reviews that tell me it's pretty much just a continuation of the same filler type of information that would serve better in a glossary at the end of the book. But I'minvested in the series and will just have to push through until we somehow come to a logical conclusion to this series before I totally lose interest in it.
3,Hard to follow with all the new characters,"The book adds in a number of new characters and it's hard to follow who's who. Also, some of the characters from the other book are not included which I found disappointing. I think it's probably a transition book and not as good as some of the other ones in the series."
3,A Plot Overheard,"Just a few things to add to the previous reviews: It's odd how almost all the real action in this volume--the taking of castles, the Blackfish's escape, Loras Tyrell's heroic attack, Arya's murder of the singer, and so forth--is related second-hand. Instead, we get to watch Cersei in her boudoir and Brienne wander around aimlessly.Also, it's not clear why the author still feels compelled to introduce new characters--Arianne of Dorne, for instance--when all the old wonderful ones don't have enough to do. A strange piece of work, this book, but somehow still compelling."
5,Delivery better than book,"Arrived packaged with another book with no detriment to either. Was sent on time and in great condition, though I wish I could give the book as many stars in a review as I give its delivery."
2,dragging on to nowhere,"The first 2 books were good, the third started to feel like a long road to nowhere. The 4th book feels like the author is stretching a good concept out way too long,no real plot and it all feels like its been done in previous books. Won't be bothering with book 5."
2,Not worth the time or effort.,"Just not worth the time or effort to read. I waited ""years"" for this book and was not able to finish this turkey once it arrived. What in the heck happened? Was is Mr. Martin or was it me? To find out I went back and re-read the first book of this series. It not me..."
4,"Pleased, but...","First and foremost - this is not one of those series that you can read out of order. Start with the first book.That being said, many seem disappointed by this book - well, half-book. This is actually half of what Martin intended for the complete novel. While I might have made the divide differently - Sam's viewpoints seem out of place in my opinion - I was not disappointed. I also cannot agree that the plot is not advancing; the end of the book, especially, furthers the plot. Characters are on trial that I would never have expected.There are some drawbacks to the novel - innumerable unanswered questions, for one. Still, if you were a fan of the first three novels, there is much to enjoy.Overall, I was only completely disappointed with one thing: The fact that it was over too quickly. Ah well, here's to another year of waiting!"
1,major letdown,"After reading the first three books one right after the other, I couldn't wait to get to the ""end"". Well, there is no end. So if you prefer a finite plot line, with some tonal variation, quit while you're ahead. Instead of bringing loose ends together, Martin has just created more of them. New locales, new characters; why not just write a new series, and give us some satisfaction by creating an ending for this one?"
3,Martin gone Jordan,"I was a great fan of this series - up to this point every new book was better than then one before - which is amazing.However, with this book Martin bucks this fantastic trend - this new book is more akin to Jordan's books 7 through 10 in the ""Wheel of Time"" series than to its own predecessors.I'll give Martin one more chance with the ""Dance of The Dragons"" - and I really hope it is not going to be Jordanesque ""Watching the Paint Dry"" :)"
1,good item bad seller,This item was sold at a great price but I did not receive it until 12 days after it was promised.
1,Expensive and tastes like cardboard,"It looks like these Krispy Grahams are popular with some people, but I had the opposite experience.I found their appearance, their texture, and (most importantly) their actual taste unpleasant. Personally, I prefer plain old Honey Maid Graham Crackers almost any time (especially for S'mores). Honestly, these just taste stale. Is that what spelt is supposed to taste like? I understand it is a healthy kind of wheat that dates back to the Middle Ages, so could be!And what does the train on the box have to do with anything? Seems like just a way to get kids to hound their parents to buy it.P.S. Amazon lists two different package sizes (6- and 12-packs), however it appears that neither have ever been available for purchase. (""Want us to e-mail you when this item becomes available?"") I suggest merging reviews, and possibly removing the listing(s) altogether unless one or more sellers actually offers such a product."
5,"Really great, just like FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE","THE SPY WHO LOVED ME with Roger Moore and made in 1977 was one of the greatest of its time. Set in many wonderful settings, including Egypt, made it really authentic. Another movie featuring SPECTRE agents and one who goes to Bond's side, which makes it one of those classics.Besides the plot, the gadgets are cool and make it really entertaining. Richard Kiel as Jaws is also a great addition to the movie, which makes it a little bit ""cooky"". You just won't want to miss this one.So, enjoy!"
5,Jaws,"Quite remarkable that Jaws always seems to survive anything that 007 deals him. The case makes Moore look like he was young when he acted in this movie but when you actually play the movie he still looks to old for the part, all those wrinkles in his face."
5,Valuable insights on a critical topic,"This is an important book about Christian unity, which the Bible tells us is close to God's heart. The book's subtitle sums up its goal and contents well: ""Learning how Christians can walk hand-in-hand when they don't see eye-to-eye."" The authors, while academically sound, are writing from their own first-hand experiences. The book is well-balanced, and offers tools to help Christians build rich relationships with other followers of Christ outside of their own faith community without discounting or giving up the distinctives of their faith community."
3,Was not like Kitaro My Best,"Maybe I will listen to it again later, but it did not strike me with the intensity of Kitaro My Best. Maybe there is something more to it like ""your"" state of mind which I'm sure is true."
4,On-going Saga of Lestat,"The book, though not as wonderful as the former three in the series, is great nonetheless. As Lestat himself stated, the book is the modern chapter of the Vampire Chronicles. No more murking and poking around in the good ol' days, this is what happening *now*. Although there're moments in the book where our brat prince seems to have undergone a personality and intelligence depravement, by the ending of the book our beloved hero is fully back being the 'damnedest creature.' All and all, the only I can say is, ""Lestat, you just gotta love him."""
3,Not a total waste of time,"I think Ms.Rice lost focus with this book. The Vampire Chronicles are about being a vampire not whinning about how awful it is to be human, she could have written another book on Louis and it would have had more depth. I was surprised at the end however and enjoyed it at least to that extent."
4,"starts slow, but takes off","it was tough to get through the beginning 100-150 pp, but after that. rice did a good job of putting something together that is totally different that the first 3 books. i couldn't put it down."
2,Tedious and predictable,"I've been on a vampire kick of late and decided to read the next book in the Vampire Chronicles. I read ""The Vampire Lestat"" and ""The Queen of the Damned"" over 15 years ago when I was in high school. I was disappointed in this book for the lack of imagination and tedium. Unless my memory fails me, this book seems nothing like the first three stories (I didn't read ""The Interview with the Vampire"" but saw the film). I remember them being full of adventure, mystery, and sensuality. I remember them having interesting stories to tell. ""The Tale of the Body Thief"" seemed very predictable to me...I guessed all the major plot twists from the very beginning. The words felt heavy and tedious to read. If you have to know what happens in this book, I'd just read the synopsis on Wikipedia."
2,a 1/3 worth reading,"I was told that this could be a stand alone book and was fairly good, because I never read Interview or the rest, but I tried it anyways, based on that it was stand alone and good. The stand alone was right. You didn't have to read the previous ones to pick this up and read it, whenever there was a reference to back story, it was explained. In full. Multiple times. This was my biggest problem with the book actually, the repeat re-read of details over and over just bored me to tears. Then there was the story. This was not good, if anything non-existant. A good editor could have carved this down to a 50 page story, it was mostly just lamenting over the past. I know that was the point of wanting to be human, but did it ever just drag on. Now I did like the perspective of how the vampire felt and his removal from society, and some of the longing for old ways was good, but there was JUST TOO MUCH OF IT!!! anyways, I can't say this was worth it."
5,The Body Thief,"The vampire Lestat bares his tormented soul in ""The Tale of the Body Thief"". He tires of life as a vampire and dreams about life as a human. When the opportunity arises, he trades his vampie body for a human body for a short term ""human"" experience. Lestate finds that life as a human is not at all as easy as he had imagined and things get complicated when he is unable to trade his body back to the vampire form.The story is enthralling and fascinating and kept me at the edge of my chair, unable to put the book down. I felt for Lestat, his longings and need to be human, and was almost able to understand why he took the risk of trading his vampire body for a human one. But thinking about it logically, it was a very stupid thing he did and the consequences well deserved.To me it is the best book from the Vampire Chronicles. Anne Rice has a very unique way to write and her eye for the smallest of details is amazing and brings life to the characters and the settings."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Some time has passed since the Queen of the Damned, and Lestat is a bit depressed. He tries to get a tan, but that doesn't work, and he can't talk his best human friend into becoming a vamp.Thereafter we get a triangle, after the Body Thief turns up, and offers to switch bodies with Lestat, then Talbot gets a turn at youth, etc. Eventually Lestat gets mad, and does away with BT and turns Talbot.A significant drop in quality from the first three books."
4,"GOOD book, better than MEMNOCH THE DEVIL! <--AHHH","An okay book. So what if people have problems with Vampire's being bisexual... ?? Humans do it, why can't they? I have to admit that it seemed Lestat was a bit too stupid to let his body be stolen, I mean, come on, let's see... to be a human and have no powers whatsoever as compared to an all powerful vampire to do everything and anything he wants... hmmm?? Even if Lestat was curious of being human again, and experiencing a human life... how could he be so dim-witted to switch his body with a man like that? Oh well, if he didn't there would be no story, so nevermind.Overall, the book is interesting to read. I liked it, I enjoyed it, even if Anne Rice likes to describe things to like the most microscopic detail... it's like, OKAY, I KNOW the table is brown... who cares who painted it!!!!"
4,Great read,"Another great book by Anne Rice. Typical sexy, incorrigible Lestat with an interesting spin. Kept me on the ""edge of my seat"" and I had a hard time putting it down."
3,"Good story, WAY to preachy","I really liked the first three books Anne wrote in this series. However, it seems she gets more and more preachy every book she writes. I want to read a great story, not lectured on her views of the world. The story would not have suffered any, if these preaching interludes were left out. This is the last Anne Rice book I bought and it will remain that way. It is too bad, because Lestat was pretty cool."
1,worst i ever read!,"I have to say that this is the worst book i've ever read! The summary first intrigued me however when i read what happens when Lestat gives his body up for that of a human? It was very boring and was really a chore to plod through the pages. I barely finished it and had to rely on those bribed reviews to keep myself going! I don't know what it was, but I felt that within that book, there was something lacking and there wasn't any depth to the book, none at all. WOuld have been better if I was wise enough to borrow it from the library instead of spending my own money for it. ONly book i can think that's a little better than this piece of junk is Vittorio the Vampire. Listen Anne RIce, if you are reading this, do me a favor and stop writing the chronicles! There are other supernatural stuff you can write about such as werewolves and ghosts."
2,Good but not Good enough,The idea for this book was a good one...but the storyline itself was never really a eye opener. Only for hardcore Anne Rice readers
1,too many VOCs,"This co-sleeper reeked of varnish. We had to return it because it smelled so terrible. I didn't want my baby breathing in the toxic fumes it was putting off. It really is a very attractive, sturdy, easy to install piece but the smell was too much for us."
1,A review of Greg.,"Greg seems to know his stuff... NOT!!! He really seems to have met the ""I am over the age of 13."" requirement for this site... NOT!!! He's obviously a bitter loser that doesnt know anything about music... RIGHT!!! I gave him one star so he feels good about himself and doesnt cry to mommy, but trust me, if there were negatives, he'd definitely get a good number."
3,"Deluxe Down Alternative Pillowtop Foam Bed, Cal King","I really like this, however I have a king size bed and figured that although it would be a little bigger, that would be alright. However the cover is actually 5 inches smaller that a king, so I was a little dissapointed, but the sheets fit over it, so that's okay."
2,Seriously flawed,I purchased this video for use in my classroom. My core resource is Edith Hamilton's Mythology. The video's stories do not align much with this repuatable book. Oversimplification and bizarre tellings of myths riddle this documentary. Myths are also constantly compared and contrasted with Judeo-Christian mythology.This program consists of interviews with scholars interspersed with a voiceover narrating myths. These myths are illustrated by classical pieces of painting and sculpture. Immature classrooms might not handle well the naked figures therein.Purchasing this video has been a waste. I will not use it in my classroom.
1,Gods and Goddesses,"I ordered this twice because the first time my DVD player said Incorrect Disc. I thought it was faulty so I sent it back and got another, but the second one did the same thing, and I tried it on other players. I was very sorry not to be able to see it and wonder what is wrong with the discs."
5,dog bones,Pooch LOVES these bones!!!! The box was delivered to the house and she immediately started pawing at the package. They are the perfect size for a small dog to enjoy.
5,My Dog's LOVE them.,My babies love these! I wouldn't buy any other type of bones other than Dingo's.
4,"Good, but not what was expected","Based on the first review, I figured I'd be getting a three-pack of cases with belt clips. Instead, what I got was a three-pack of cases with no belt clip (which was one of the reasons I chose this item). The case is designed to wrap around a belt and give you access to the iPod. Fine if you're wearing a belt, but not so good if you're in shorts or sweats. In addition, the magnetic clasp has been replaced by Velcro. Cheaper to reproduce I'm sure, but Velcro is problematic in a lot of ways. Even so, Velcro is more secure, which is a concern if you're active. Still, there are some bonuses. First, it's a three-pack. Second, it fits the iPod Nano (mine is 2nd generation, 2GB) very nicely. Third, the design allows the screen to be protected and still give you access to the control wheel, even in the case. Fourth, the case is nylon, not leather, so it's animal friendly and will presumably last longer. I'd give it 5 stars if it had a belt clip, even with the Velcro."
3,A tad disappointed,"Have only had the Bounce Lite for a few weeks. It seems to do the job and I like the position of the on and off switch which, is located on the bottom of the unit and would be difficult to accidentally turned off. I didn't do my job researching but, it should serve the hobbyist well. Professionals should keep researching."
4,CANT BE BETTER MUST READ THIS,"First off, Risky Business is a great movie to see before you go to college! Its one of TOm Cruises first movies and the movie itslelf is just hysterical! Ships fast and at a great price also"
4,Love this movie,The movie arrived on time. It was at a reasonable price and was in a small box to prevent any damage.
3,"Loved the movie, but the DVD was slighly defective","I've always been a big fan of the 80's, which was part of the reason that I purchased this movie. The movie arrived on time which was great. Tom Cruise is a great actor. As for the lead female character, I'm surprised she's not as famous as Tom Cruise is. I'd like to see her in more movies. The plot of the movie is that a ""responsible,"" privileged 17-year old guy, is left alone for a weekend, and finally has some real fun. This gets out of hand when he meets Lana, a call girl. . .The quality of the DVD was okay, I bought it used so I didn't expect it to be perfect. However, about 40 minutes into the movie the movie started to stutter, then it stopped working all together. I then had to flip the DVD over to the other side; it worked. This malfunction was the reason I gave 3 stars instead of 4 or 5."
4,Sometimes you just have to say what the heck,"I thought it was a terrific movie. I felt like I had every one of Cruise's phobia's when I was his age. And when he's frantic to get out of class and the clock somehow goes back a minute--I've been there, too. Besides Cruise's charm, Curtis Armstrong is funny as his friend who worries about his midterm while being chased by Guido, the killer pimp. I lived in Chicago then and a photographer friend told me that the hookers at the party were Chicago fashion models. One of the models was Candace Collins, who did some work for Playboy before an interviewer asked her if it was sexist and she answered yes. Then the magazine dropped her like a rock."
4,"good family reading, old fashioned fun and lessons to learn","This book was a read aloud choice for my 8yo and since we have relatives in the south who grew up in the depression, we loved it. Shades of the waltons but better!"
5,Ida Early,"Life in the Sutton household will never be the same! When Ida Early comes to the Sutton house, she tells tales taller tha herself.She tries to teach Randall how to lasso things, then saves one little girl from an angry bear. From cooking on pirate ships to rideing BEAR back this book will leave you wanting to read the sequal! BY JENNIFER RICHARDSON"
4,Statistics,"This book was very helpful with the subject matter. It arrived in a timely manner and in great condition,thanks."
2,"Not too bad, considering...","This could have been a lot worse. It must be understood that Ian Fleming died while writing the novel, and the publishing company finished it. The book was very weak as a result, so the writers had to come up with something fresh. The result is not all that memorable, though Christopher Lee makes a decent villain as always. Herve Villechaize is Lee's sidekick, and is probably the best thing in the film. Plot-wise, Bond learns there is a contract taken out on him, while he has to find a solar-energy disk of some sort. Moore still looks a little uncomfortable and confused about what Bond is supposed to be like. He gets it right in the next film, though."
3,Golden Gun lacks polish,"The Man With The Golden Gun is the 007 that you find inane, but you can't help but watch it.Made immediately after Live and Let Die,TMWTGG has gone down as the weakest of the 007 entries, despite the presence of Christopher Lee as the ""nipuler"" million dollar hitman, Scaramanga.Bond's mission takes him to Tailand where he tracks down Scaramanga who has put a hit on 007.The problem with the movie are it's production values(Scaramanga's funhouse and an impressive, yet unrealistic corkscrew jump) and inane characters(Britt Eckland as incompetant, yet sexy Mary Goodnight,Herve Villicheze as hench man Nick-Nack , and the unnessesary return of Clifton James' Sheriff J.W. Pepper the badly stereotypical redneck law enforcer from LALD.Even with it's multiple flaws,TMWTGG may be inane and wan, but it's still a fun movie to watch."
4,Great Bond with one lousy part,"This is a great Bond movie. You could tell it was written for Connery, right before his departure from the series. It's very suspenseful, and has a great premise, and a great villain in Christopher Lee. However, about an hour an a half into the movie, there's one glaring fault that always bothers me: as Bond jumps his car over a river in an amazing stunt during a chase sequence, the filmmakers added the sound effect of a child's whislte; the whistle is the first note in the dumbing-down of Bond we suffered in the 70s. It announces to us the series is about to get very silly. Had Connery been in this one, it would have been one of the best of the entire series."
2,Pretty Lousy. Not as bad as View to A Kill or Moonraker,"Tired and old, and it was only Roger Moore's second outing as Bond. Exotic locations and the gorgeous Britt Ekland can't make up for a lackluster story and two rather poorly drawn villains (though Christopher Lee is a great actor). This movie ranks third as the most awful in the series, behind View to a Kill and Moonraker."
3,Rushed,"Some great footage, but it seemed to be rushed into production. It does not hang together well. I wish the editing had been more professional."
2,Huge disappointment,"I must be the odd person out on this movie, but it was way beyond slow. This was purchased with high expectations, as I normally enjoy both Jeff Bridges and Michelle Pheiffer. What a huge disappointment. This would most easily be compared to readying yourself for an airplane ride -- as you settle in with anticipation and excitement ... then for the next several hours you are crawling along the runway at 3 mph. Later, the engine slows, and stops and you realize that it's never going to take off."
5,Just as promised,I have been reading about the wonderful properties of Astaxathin and decided to give this label a try. Service was just great. It arrived quickly and it is just what I ordered.
4,Easy to take vitamins with good benefits,"I've been taking this for over a month, have not noticed any significant improvements but did not have any issues prior to taking it. I bought it to protect my skin from the sun as I was reading how it is a natural way to prevent sunburn. :)"
2,some interesting data,"A lot of theories (Sci-Fi) some useful facts but not as compelling as ""Intelligent Design"". There is just no way to verify the theories put forth. Also the two disks are redundant rehashing the same points. Some excellent animation to show what is out there but you may notice that the scientists say different numbers when speaking about the ""facts""!As a University educated science major I found not enough new material but for kids or lay people this could be a very interesting leap into the theories going around. Starting with the Big Bang theory was a mistake I think as it has all but totally been abandoned. The ""Law"" of ""conservation of energy"" dictates that you can not get something from nothing! Especially if your talking about the nearly infinite mass of the universe, Duh!The point is: theories are Sci-fi and Laws are fact. Wait for theories to become Laws!"
5,A users guide to the cosmos,"Our family are so absorbed into this great guide BR. It showes us from the big bang to galaxies, stars, planets and moons. It is definitely a primer for anyone who has ever looked up at the night sky and wondered."
5,WoW,"What a great dvd. Very educational and beautiful photography. I would definitely recommend this to individuals that have a passion about science, and how the universe works. Learned a lot just sitting back and viewing the dvd."
3,how the universe works - DVD,"This DVD is rich in computer graphics and information regarding theories on how the universe works. Nevertheless, I would rather have more information based on the pictures taken by the space telescopes. I think this topic can be more deeply explored and presented in such a way as to give a broader idea of the dynamics of the universe based on the information the scientists do have instead of speculations."
2,Not that funny and I don't need a manual.,I thought this book would be a funny read for my die hard outdoor friends. It was not. While slitley amusing it is far to serious and not in a good (adult) way. Some how they have managed to almost take the fun out of the title.
1,"Some fun scenes, but needs a MAJOR revision.","Hudson Hawk....Hmm...Where to start? This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'll admit that while it's bad, there are a few entertaining aspects of it. I especially liked the scenes where Willis had to deal with a bunch of agents codenamed after candybars. But seriously, the movie never gets funny, original, or action-packed enough to the point of paying eight bucks to see it. Predictable, stupid, and utterly lame, ( the running joke is that Willis has been in jail so long, he doesn't know what Nintendo is) Hudson Hawk only deserves to be seen on television when reruns of Seinfeld or Cheers isn't on."
5,It lasts and lasts,"This DVD brings back great memories. I remember seeing this film for the first time in the movie theater and laughing till I cried. And then realizing that, while the theater was half full, I was the only one making noise.If you have yet to see this film, I'm sorry. And if you have seen this film and didn't get it, I'm very sorry. Bruce Willis went up in my estimation with how well he played Hudson Hawk. He pulled it off in a ""I know this is smarmy, but you just got to laugh"" kind of way. Andie McDowell played the perfect ""straight man"" (ok,woman)So if you are looking for a belly laugh that lasts and lasts, this is the movie to watch."
1,Funny...,"Funny! Not the movie, but the fact that one reviewer insinuated that Bruce Willis himself should have written most of the positive reviews of this movie! Actually, Bruce Willis once said during an interview that he regretted ever participating in this lousy movie but that he just couldn't be choosy at the time. You must smile at the fact that so many reviewers found it worth 4-5 stars.Watch ""The Whole Nine Yards"" for a jazzy flick with Bruce or ""City Hall"" for serious movie with a few nice old songs!"
2,Buffering .... Buffering and More Buffering,Hmm think maybe there was buffering? 14 More Words Required? Well then ...Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering. 14 and then Some! Network is fine!
2,A Waste of Time,"I fast-forwarded through 20 minutes of this movie just to get to the end and see what happened. My curiosity was not rewarded. My thought was, ""What a stupid movie."" It's two redeeming factors are the location (Italy) and the fabulous music used to time the robberies. Other than that, it was crass, shallow, and a waste of my time."
2,the stupidest movie Willis has done?,"Silly, dumb, idiotic, unbelievable, manic, wacky, wasted talent, poorly written, 8-year-old humor, absurd, insulting, not really very funny, don't waste your time."
4,Please give them the benefit of the doubt.,"Probably this film is a bit silly here and there, but hey! It's supposed to be a comedy! It's not meant to be Die Hard, y'know...I own the region 2 version of the DVD, so I don't know if the same scene-for-scene comment of director Michael Lehmann appears on the region 1 version. I couldn't help but feel a lot of sympathy for him.You can't win all the time. Besides, he's right: this film was a MAJOR hit in Europe... The tomato ketchup scene is hilarious."
4,It's a comic book movie,"I think the biggest problem with this movie is that people think they're supposed to take it seriously. Ummmm, no. It's satirical comedy, not straight comedy.All the indignant people who pan this movie by saying it's stupid are taking it way too seriously. Of course it's stupid, it's satire.(warning, some minor spoilers, but they don't matter much) I mean, the love interest is a nun, he mails himself to the Vatican, he spends the whole movie trying to get a cup of capuccino and his parole officer tries to get him to commit a crime.Think The Da Vinci Code meets Laurel and Hardy."
4,funny and irreverent with a side of the surreal,"I love this movie. I don't care who knows it. I think I understand why some people didn't get it - I once found it in a video store in the ""Drama"" section. And I admit it probably takes more than one viewing to really be able to follow along - especially some of the stranger scene cuts. But it's funny. Really funny. Sure it's over the top, but that's the point. It's imminently quotable, and the special effects and action are actually quite good. But the viewer has to go in expecting a surreal farce. Otherwise, of course they'll be disappointed. Everyone I've ever introduced Hudson Hawk to has thoroughly enjoyed the watching. In fact, I feel a little sorry for anyone who didn't get it when they saw it; they're truly missing out."
1,Hudson hawk,I cannot believe there are actually people out there who like this movie. It would be the worst film I have watch in decades.
3,"Great beginner set, but doesn't hold heat","I received this set as a Christmas gift a couple of years ago. I love it - the non-stick surface makes cleaning a snap. However, the thin cooking surface doesn't hold a lot of heat, and now that I have a gas range the skillets are beginning to warp. But if you don't do a lot of high-heat cooking these pans are pretty good."
4,Great product - recomment to get it,"i have been using this t-fal sets for over 7 years and have been very happy with them. there is one thing, though, it only lasts for about 2 years and then you need to throw it out and get a new set."
2,They just dont last very long,I purchased this set about 4 years ago and there is nothing left from this set. The sad thing is I don’t even cook often so I'm guessing it was just a poor quality.
4,Love Nonstick,These t fal pots are great. The only negative factor is the fact that the pot covers don't work or fit with the pans. Other than that this a recommended product.
4,Great Bargain,"This product is great for the money, so far. I've used every piece and I haven't had any problems with anything sticking. It's easy to wash and I think is a great buy. I like this product and recommend it to anyone."
4,Brilliant....but!,"I agree with the previous reviewer - the Sonny Steelgrave arc was brilliant, with superb performances from Ken Wahl, Jonathon Banks and Ray Sharkey. But why take out the song 'Nights in White Satin' which was the perfect backdrop to the final confrontation? The song highlighted the emotions that the Vinnie and Sonny were feeling and really added to the scene. Other than that, I can't recommend the DVD highly enough."
5,A little fact checking goes a long way...,"In case anybody besides Amazon missed it, Ken Wahl played Vincent Terranova for at least the first three seasons of Wiseguy. I'm not sure if he was replaced by Stephen Bauer (the actor who played ""Manny"", Tony Montana's buddy in Scarface) beginning with season 4 or later, but ALL of the Amazon product descriptions which state that these boxed sets of Wiseguy star Stephen Bauer and NOT Ken Wahl are INCORRECT."
1,City of Angels was way better!,"Save your $3.50 DVD rental fee. If you're looking for a movie that will make you feel like City of Angels made you feel, look elsewhere! Sorry, my vote is for Hollywood. The director of Wings admits that there was no script before shooting began. The extras that came with the Wings DVD, interviews and info on Berlin, were more entertaining than the movie."
3,"Inspired idea, flawed realization","So much more could have been done. The basic premise of an angel being drawn over to our side, knowing all of out thoughts, fears and dreams should have resulted in a richer, more alluring celebration of the sensual world we inhabit. With more action and less words. In the same breath it has to be said that one is thankful for remarkable restraint where the facts could so easily have lead to the type of vouyeristic excess which has become commonplace. Imagine the sordidity to be faced if David Lynch had been at the helm."
5,Wings of Desire,"This dvd could not be bought in Vancouver. Blockbusters only had to rent and were not helpful when I wanted to place an order. VideoWorks did not have it for rent or for sale and could not order it for me. They suggested I go through Amazon. I was pleased with the service, which was quick, and pleased with the quality, which was like new. I ordered two copies for both my sons who are into excellent movies, most of which are foreign or independent."
3,Gorgeous but dull,"Yes, I loved this film when I saw it in the theatre. But I have to admit, watching the DVD, that it is mostly dull, slow-moving, and pretentious. If there's any reason to own it, it's Henri Alekan's amazing black and white photography (he used a filter he'd devised for Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast), and two terrific actors: Peter Falk, in one of his best roles as an angel turned human, and Bruno Ganz, as an angel who wants to become human."
2,"Trying: too, too trying","If you're in a vacant or a pensive mood, you might find that this will match it. Two tidy middle-aged angels meander around Berlin, dressed in their everyday clothes. They wear ponytail haircuts and no-one can see them, but otherwise they're just like all the other citizens. If you get up to make a cup of tea or go to the bathroom while viewing this film, don't worry, you won't have missed anything crucial. Yes, it's possible to immerse oneself in the existential and semi-surreal ambience, but there's a permanent nagging question: why bother? The other nagging question is how did this film ever get made ? I mean what exactly grabbed someone enough to fork out the dosh to do it? A third question is: What is Life? Who knows, who knows. I'm not knocking it: more power to Wim for the luxury of indulging himself in this manner. Maybe I'll try again in about six months time. If at first you don't succeed, etc etc."
1,Grainy - Despite Being a Criterion Collection,"This rating is strictly based on the image quality of the blu-ray disc. Because it is both blu-ray and a Criterion Collection disc, I was expecting an excellent quality image, but was very disappointed to find so much grain. If you already have the standard DVD copy, you might want to save your money and pass on this disc."
2,Ingmar Bergman meets...the Euro-Goths!,"I watched this believing that this was a ""masterpiece"" that I was supposed to be in awe of. After nearly two-and-half hours, I still couldn't figure out why (and I absolutely LOVE certain art house flicks). Along with other previous critics' laments, this film is too long, too self-absorbed in both its visuals and its dialogue (i.e., beautiful shots and existential drivel do not a great movie make), and is, ultimately, extremely pretentious. But the very WORST part for this viewer was having to suffer through Nick Cave at HIS mid-'80s angst-ridden worst! Mixed with the moody, brooding B&W footage, oddly chosen camera angles, and mystic back-story, the film amounts to Bergmanesque pseudo-meaningful drivel."
5,Love it,"When I heard that Roger Moore was going to play James Bond, I didn't think it would be a good idea. Boy was I wrong. Loved this movie. It had so much adventure and chases going on, it was unreal. You were exhausted when you left the theater.There were times that you weren't sure of who the bad guys were in this movie. As usual it all worked and Bond gets the girl in the end. The scenery in Greece was awesome."
1,For Your Eyes Only Blu-Ray..will not load..,I have ordered this disc twice from Amazon and both discs I have received will not load past the FBI warning. I guess I will keep ordering a replacement until I get one that will play.
4,One of Bond's Best,"I watched this movie for Carole Bouquet, and she did not disappoint. In this movie her secret agent father is assassinated and she is bent on revenge. (Two years later in ""Buffet Froid"" her father, an account was killed and she was bent on revenge then, too.) Roger Moore as 007 is united with her in their common cause, as he attempts to retreive valuable computer data from the bottom of the sea. 007 looks old in this movie, which adds to the unreality of the whole situation. I liked the contrast between Swiss and Greek sceneries in this film. As far as Bond movies go, this is one of the best."
4,Great Product,"The quality of the video, picture is very very good. Only downside is the audio, it sounded washed out or muted throughout most of the movie. I had to play with my home theater receiver to find a suitable sound. I get better audio from local TV news than this movie. This might keep me from purchasing other other Bond movies."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:One of the leaner, meaner Bonds, For Your Eyes Only briefly took the series back from the preposterous Moonraker to its more hard-edged roots; though this was to be only a brief respite before Octopussy returned the series to ridiculousness, it's still a worthy spy thriller."
5,007,I will always love the cleverness of 007. James Bond is like shirt and tie or a BMW neither which will go out of style.
5,A nice break from reality,"When you've had a day that sucks, slipping into this book is like taking a relaxing bath. Georgette Heyer is quite possibly the best writer of this genre. Her books are tightly plotted, the dialogue witty, and the characters fully realized, neither one dimensional or too unbelievably perfect. Unlike other books set within this time period, the characters belong more to the 19th century than to ours, with courting rather than coitus being important. And while the ending doen't come as a surprise, the getting there is fun."
2,The Bond Franchise shows it's First signs of Staleness.,"Sean Connery looks Very Tired of playing James Bond in ""You Only Live Twice""; it's not Surprising that it was one of his Last Outings in the Character that Made him Known to the World.The film lacks decent Bad guys, decent Babes, decent One Liners. It lacks everything that makes a Bond film Enjoyable. The Story and Screenplay are two of the Weaker of any Bond film, and Donald Pleasance as Blofeld appears Far too late in the film to make an Impression. After having Built up the character for so long, he Really comes as a Disappointment.The Pacing leaves a lot to be desired as well, as I often found myself searching Elsewhere for entertainment. (eg, paint drying, grass growing) ""Little Nelly"" is the films one saving grace, but its screen time is too limited.As a Bond fan, I have only been let down by a Hand full of Bond films. ""You Only Live Twice"" is, unfortunately, one of them."
5,A classic!,"You Only Live Twice was Connery's no.3 movie.It beats all his others except Thunderball (his best) and From Russia with Love.This movie had several good fight scenes.Thunderball had more,but You Only Live Twice had some better things such as it's song and the setting in Japan.I wish UA would re-release this movie!"
3,I could only give it 3 starts,"Where to begin? Connery is one of my favorate actors but he was not as sharp in YOLT. Don't get me wrong, it is a good film and quite entertaining. Connery looks like he has gained some weight and he is very sloppy. Also, he looks like he is getting very bored with the role and doesn't care in his performance in the first 4 films."
2,Disappointing Page Turner,"This book was well written, and I enjoyed the depth of her characters. I read it quickly with the hope that the ""good son"" would redeem the family somehow. Rather, he just added more issues to their broken family. I was hoping that Billingsley would bring one of the characters to real victory instead of leaving them ""kinda"" healed. Also, there were some really graphic points that I could do without."
4,Her Best One,"This was by far the best book I've read by Reshonda. I am so angry at myself for letting it sit on my bookshelf so long before reading it. I truly enjoyed this one, more so than some of her others."
4,"Excellent camera ,highly recommended!","I was surprised to read all the negative reviews about the canon z155. My own experience with this camera has been basically positive. Since purchasing the camera 7 months ago, the majority of my prints have been sharp, clear, colors bright and true to life. The only drawback i can think of is the pictures do tend to blur when using full zoom without a tripod. I dont think this is specifically Canon's problem, though, because photography books all recommend using a tripod when using a high zoom. At 155mm, one needs a very steady hand or the pictures blur. When I do use a tripod, even my pictures at the highest zoom come out crystal clear. I'd recommend this camera anytime!"
1,Worst camera ever,"I am so glad after seeing the other reviews to know that I'm not crazy- this camera really is awful! The inconsistent quality of photos is dreadful, with many underlit and blurry for no clear reason. I love my other Cannon and wish they would stay away from making such supposedly ""smart"" cameras."
1,Was The Worse Camera I Ever Come Across,"I bought this camera a month before I go on my vacation. Because I trust Canon, I didn't think that it would be a problem. But little that I know when the day I arrive in a tropical island and loaded the film, it doesn't work and wouldn't let me take any pictures. I call Canon's technical support line and they are not being very helpful at all. They went over with me the procedures that I already know. It's the same thing as the instructions.Overall, this camera ruin my trip. I have to go and buy 5 disposable camera so I would have any pictures for this trip."
1,Fails to list any credible evidence,"Betty Dorsett Duke's book gives very vague evidence that her great grandfather, James Lafayette Courtney, was in fact Jesse Woodson James. Most of the proof revolves around her ""he said"" or ""they said"" theory. Her text craftily stretches historical truth but fails to provide sources for any of her so-called facts. This fairy tale might satisfy the longings of some who still believe Jesse Woodson James escaped his bank and train robber reputation but until hard evidence comes forth, conventional history has not been challenged here."
5,Wonderful alternative to the usually sappy bedtime story,Where the Wild Things Are was my favorite bedtime story as a child. It opened up a world of imagination that isn't all fluff and nicety. Imagination can lead to adventures and even nightmares can become adventures. I think every little kid has been sent to his or her room at one time and had to rely on imaginatin to wile the time away.
5,My Wild Thing!,How can anyone not LOVE this book? This is one of my daughters favorites. She enjoys the transformation of Max's room (especially because her room is painted with trees) and that he goes on his travels without his parents. She loves that Max gets to be King of the Wild Things and tame them even though they are much bigger than he is. We have named each of the creatures and made up a song especially for The Wild Rumpus. This book really inspires imagination!
1,not as good as new books,I am almost 7 and my teachre said we have to say why we like a lot of books or do not like a lot of books this summer on amazon and then print out them and give them to our new teacher next year So I am starting with this book.My dad reelly likes this book because he said it was good when he was a kid. I dont like it. The pictures are boring and the story is not long. My dad reads this to me a lot and I like the books that are newer. New books have pictures that are pretty and the storys are funner and longer. This book has pictures that look old. I wish my dad would read this to himself and let me read something diferent. Nichole
5,A classic!,"My son is too young for the book, but I had to get it because my brothers loved it so much 30 years ago... and my son is named Max! Everyone I know has fond memories of this book."
5,Awesome Book,This was an awesome book. I loved reading it. I have read it over a hundred times. I wish I could be were the wild things are.This book can really get my imagination going. I will try to use my imagination next time I'm sent to my room when I'm in trouble. I usually just sit in my room waiting for my prison time to be over.
5,We all have a little Max in us...,"What can you say. The story is timeless, but one could argue the Max was a brat. Decades from now, children will still read (and act out) this book."
3,Aaron review,This book is a good book for kids.It's about this boy whogets ready for bed.He go's outside to see if there are monsters.They come out to follow him.They go on a hike through the woods.All the monsters chase after him.So he leaves and they get mad.He gets home and his mom has his super ready.
4,December#7,I enjoyed reading this book when I was little because it showed me that if I would run away there was very scarey things out there. And that my parents would miss me no matter how many times they yelled at me or sent me to my room. They would always be there and give me supper as Max's parents do for him when he returns home after his journey. I think that it still teaches that today and I hope it does. Because kids need to know that their parents are there for them.
5,A Little Book With a Wild Heart,"I'm 23 and I've never read the book because it hasn't been released in Bulgaria. I read it the night after I saw Spike Jonez's beautiful film and at first I was somewhat disappointed by its simplicity. Then however I read several articles and interviews and I began to understand how genius and deep this book really is.Both the book and the movie, thought very different, are masterpieces in their own universes!"
5,A review of Where the Wild Things Are,"Mischievous Max gets sent to his room and has a dream in which his room becomes ""the world all around."" He sails his boat to where the wild things are, and becomes their king. They have adventures until Max decides to return to ""where someone loved him best of all,"" so he returns to his room, wakes up, and finds his supper waiting for him, and it is ""still hot."""
5,Great value,I purchased this book used and I'm very pleased with the condition. It looked brand new. I read this book to my son when he was growing up and am now reading it to my granddaughters. Its a book that children will ask you to read it over and over. I also downloaded the audio book from audible on my phone. I will play that and let my granddaughter turn the pages while we go through the book. Its great fun.
2,Plastic Frame Not Repairable,This skimmer slips through the water nicely and captures leaves well. Mine lasted a season or two and then the frame cracked near the handle. I thought I could mend the cracks with some 3M Structural Plastic 2-part adhesive. It's very strong and rather expensive stuff. Unfortunately the skimmer plastic is polyethylene or related plastic which won't bond with the adhesive.
1,"Too much water drag, plastic broke not long after I got it",It is hard to skim through the water with this skimmer. It has too much drag since the plastic is wide which caused it to crack not long after I started using it. I would NOT purchase this item again. I bought a metal framed one to replace it.
5,Your Book of Shadows,An invaluable tool to help with one's own grimoir- I've written several pages already with the help of this wonderful book ;)
5,book of shadows,with me being a beginner i thought this book be helpful in learning how to workings and incantatins
4,Great Old Movie,I got a lot of laughs out of this story. Even though the idea that this is a true story is not so good. There was humor put into it.
2,"Perhaps brilliant if performed, but a boring read","Fences centers around the tragically hubristic Troy, a man whose disappointments and pathologies form the nucleus around which all the other characters eventually interact. Although this element of Wilson's work is provocative and commendable, and although I can imagine that I would like this play significantly more if I were to see it performed, it is just not very exciting when read in a dramatic vacuum. The play contains complex dynamics of racism, loyalty, and control. If you need a book on which to write a character analysis paper, this might be it; if you want to be entertained, look elsewhere."
5,Fences,"Book, just as described. Thanks.Shipped fast and accurate.Why do I have to make so many words in a review?"
3,"Good, but not great.","This is likely as good a recital of the Robert Hanssen story as could be reasonably expected. Not nearly as interesting as the Aldrich Ames, book but the FBI isn't letting anyone inteview Hanssen so very little is becoming known. The wonderful peoople who brought us Ruby Ridge, Waco, Richard Jewell, Win Ho Lee, etc. are currently into MAJOR, big-time, heavy duty, damage control and are using every device they have to limit more about this story getting out, so we may never learn much the secrets surrounding this, but this is probably the best of what is available. The really sickening part of it is that they had evidence and probably should have caught him in 1990.On top of the Walker spy fmily, Ames, and now this It makes you wonder who is minding the store."
2,I prefer the other.,"I started reading this then switched to the The Bureau and the Mole (should be called Freeh and Hanssen) by Vise and found I liked his style better. Having read both, I find this an easier read but a bit male-bashing and female-glorifying - no doubt a reflection on the authors. I find this effort more hurried than Vise with more superficiality about Hanssens' motives. Interestingly, the SVR were VERY concerned about the cross-agency molehunt in Hanssen's July 31st 2000 commo. Is there still another high-level mole at work ?"
2,Neat buy easily destroyed,Our dog who is partially blind loved the noise it made and throwing it around. However once he was bored with that he began chewing it and the plastic easily came apart and he tried to eat it. We had to throw it away after a couple of weeks because all the ends were chewed up and we were afraid he would swallow small parts of the plastic.
5,"SIMPLY PUT ""A CLASSIC""","Let me be brief.Bobbi Humphrey is my favorite Flautist.Then,Now,and forever.The music that was created by her and the Mizell Brothers is unparalleled.Chicago Damn,Blacks and Blues,Satin Doll, Ladies Day, and Homemade Jam, to name a few are songs that no doubt will stand the test of time.The same can also be said for the collaboration of Donald Byrd and the Blackbyrds with the Mizell brothers.A strong foundation for any smooth Jazz, or just good music collection."
2,Settle,"The book wasn't that great, nor was it that bad. Coming from someone who read it for a class, this book was among the better ones, but still - forced reading is never all that good. I think everyone's reading WAY too much into this and you all need to just sit back and ENJOY the book. That's why most people read books, right? For enjoyment? I only gave it 2 stars because I'm more of a Clancy/Crichton person. Please stop attacking each other and RELAX!"
3,"intersting looks at behavior, slow but with a good twist","the setting starts slow but after that it goes into an interesting twist, offering no solutions to any of her questions."
1,NOT WORLD VOLTAGE COMPATIBLE,"Contrary to product detail, it is only 110 V.this will not work in europe or other places that have 220V."
1,Absolutely terrible - poorly researched and directed,"Looks like the work of an ameture! Only a few poeple remotely related to Google were interviewed. There were bizzare video clips ... for instance when the author was saying something like ""... there was a long road ahead of Google, they will actually show the picture of a highway"". Extremely disappointing overall."
4,red or blue. blood or cuz. it just don't matter,"""I am a nigtmare walkin just a psychopathic talkin. king of my jungle just a gangster stalkin. livin life like a firecracker quick as my fuse. Death is to death it's the colors I choose. Red or blue. Blood or cuz. It just don't matter. suckas dive for they life when when my shotgun scatters"""
3,P-p-p-Penn makes his case (horizontally),"Seeing this with the lads, we'd always get the giggles during Sean Penn's inexplicably interminable love scene. C-c-c-can't stop laughing at his ego. He won't stop bonking 'till all bonks ends. C-c-colors, colors, he's seeing colours.Sterling work from Messrs Penn and Duvall is thankfully not entirely undermined by some exploitative chase scenes."
5,Tight Ass Cop Movie!,"The movie Colors is much more brutal & realistic than Boyz In Tha Hood, Menace II Society or New Jack City, its kind of like a documentary of hardcore street life in Southern Los Angeles from notorious street gangs such as 18th Street Posse, Florencia 13's, Latin Kings, MS13's, Grape Street Crips & Piru Street Bloods. But the movie is based on what the Cops go through their daily lifes through rough Barrios / Projects of Watts, Lynwood & South Central Los Angeles, CA. Colors also shows the brutal mentallity of how Cops deal with young blacks & latinos of the streets of Los Angeles, CA. Colors is both Dramatic & a Thrilling film, don't care who you are, good flick! Also! Ice-T debuts his hit song Colors on this movie, too!"
3,A middling Bond movie,"Bond in space. With lasers. For me this is lower on my list of favorite Bond movies. The gadgets weren't that great, the music was not the best and the plot was even more over the top than usual. I am also not the biggest fan of Roger Moore's interpretation of Bond and his psyche. He is much more comical and soft than the Bonds before and after him. The Blu-Ray is a nice clean up of the picture, but there is only so much that can be done with the older movies before the special effects work becomes obvious. The soundtrack is probably the most improved aspect of this movie vs. the DVD. The color and contrast of the film is also greatly improved vs the DVD."
3,Moore's worst,"Even though Roger Moore is my favorite Bond, I can't defend this mess. The only standout is the villian Hugo Drax. He clearly stole the show. After a thrilling opening this movie goes downhill in a hurry. If not for Die another Day, Tomorrow Never Dies and The World is not Enough, this would be the worst in the series."
4,I think he is attempting re-entry,"Released in 1979, Moonraker took the Bond franchaise to new heights. Always trying to come up with a variety of new exotic locations for each film , the producers decided there was one place never visted by 007.......SPACE. The plot has Bond trying to stop criminal industrialist Hugo Drax (Micheal Lonsdale) from wiping out the world's population with deadly nerve gas which is dispersed from space so he can set up his own master race. Aided by C.I.A/astronaut Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles) and pursued by Jaws (Richard Kiel) fresh from The Spy Who Loved Me, who has the most cringe worthy scene of the whole Bond series with his love interest. Moonraker may be a far cry from the earlier Bond films such as From Russia With Love but is still very enjoyable , definately not the worst Bond ever"
2,TWO STARS FOR CAMP VALUE ALONE,"James Bond meets Lost In Space (the TV Series).Although not an adament 007 fan, I do enjoy this franchise and have seen all of the films in their entirety.Moonraker deserves praise if not simply for the fact that it is one of THE campiest films ever made. My friend and I were on the floor, gasping for air and tearing up with laughter when James' Gondola is transformed into a totally impractical hovercraft ! When watching this sequence, check out the shot of the bird doing a double take - one of the worst cinematic devices ever employed.Suspend your disbelief, enjoy Shirley Bassey's opening number (which lyrically makes about as much sense as the film), and hold on tight. This is a wild ride, stretching ones imagination beyond any reasonable limmits !"
1,Moonraker,"After classic Bonds Dr.No, From Russia with Love and Goldfinger and the stunning photography in Thunderball and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, this is an embarassment to the taut, ruthless and dashing character that is James Bond, reduced to here to an absurd cartoon-like plot and silly characters. Total excess, in my opinion, the low point of the Bond series."
2,Very silly and tired Bond space film...,"I suppose when one watches a Bond film, he isn't expecting realistic plot devices or depthy characters. But this movie goes overboard on giving us a completely unlikely premise. There is a point in the movie where American astronauts are doing battle in space with the henchmen of Hugo Drax... with lasers. ... but it's strange that on a certain level, this is actually pretty cool. It's a shame that the rest of the movie tries so hard in making the film a slapstick comedy. Plus, the pace of the film is tired and forced and, pardon the pun, never really seems to get off the ground. Add to this some completely awful acting and you've got yourself a pure stinker, Bond style."
3,"Bond, James Bond...In SPACE","Last night I decided to watch the most controversial James Bond Film Moonraker. Id say 60% of it was great. As good as any Roger Moore Bond film. But that other 40% was so weird that it almost ruined the whole thing.The high performance motor-driven gondola he had in Venice was REALLY BAD. The gondola even turned into a hover craft (???????????????????). Bond also had a few cheesy fight scenes with Jaws that were hard to watch. Also Jaws finding a girlfriend (??????)(Who was actually pretty by the way) was a bit too much to bare.Moonraker came out after Star Wars and they wanted to put Bond in space. Which thankfully was only the last 30 minutes of the film. I threw in the towel when a full fledged SPACE WAR broke out between American Space Marines and Drex's evil hoard. Just a bunch of guys floating around in space suits with LASER GUNS, ala Star Wars. That was it for me.......Its a shame because the rest of the movie was pretty good."
5,ULTIMATLEY A MASTER PIECE OF THE CENTURY,"This is probally in the TOP 5 James bond movies ever, Stroey line was great, and that guy above mine who says james bond was a kidder and a jokster. HELLO! look at the james bond movies he jokes except the ones with stupid timothy Dalton. I especially love the part in venice and at Drax industries JAMES BOND is like a God too me. Deffinetly James Bond Ranks up Number #1 on my list up near StarWars, And the X-Files."
2,Silly and Plain Corny,"If ""A View to a Kill"" is consider the worst Bond film, this turkey call ""Moonraker"" has to be viewed as the silliest Bond film of all times. James Bond in Space? Why oh why?The movie is filled with problems. Roger Moore sleepwalks his way in his performance. Lois Chiles (Dr. Holly Goodhead) is one of the dullest Bond girls of all times. Michael Lonsdale (Drax) is a brilliant actor, but in this movie he appears bored. The storyline of Richard Kiel (Jaws) finding a girlfriend was so corny I could not believe it. And the space fight scene at the end was hilarious in the worst way. Despite this, this movie was a HUGE success (thanks to the return of the character Jaws and the success of Star Wars, which this film ripped off) and is considered the quintessential Bond film. However, most hardcore Bond fans (like myself) consider this film a joke, especially with Bond and Goodhead making love mid-air in space. Yes, its that silly. Watch for a good laugh!"
3,Not All it is Cracked Up to Be,This was more like a school book than anything else. It is like no other book that i have read. This book is a short biography leaving out the details that would have made it a 5 star book like Pimp by Iceberg Slim
5,Works like a charm,"You can spend a lot more getting replacement wheels for this stupid cart, but these are great. They were a perfect fit, went on in a jiffy and have been great ever since. I guess that makes for a perfect purchase. And it was WAY cheaper than replacing the whole cart, which was still in good condition except the original wheels dry-rotted."
3,Female Story with Weak Female Lead,"Given how much the plot depends on the Russian woman's character, they chose a really mediocre actress for the part. Yes, looks do count, but the ability demonstrated by Ms. Bianchi really takes away from an otherwise classic Bond effort.I happen to like the early Bonds as a general proposition. They are truer to Fleming's classic writing and don't rely on silliness. I don't like the racism and sexism much, but the adventure is really the genuine article.One of the real beefy attributes here is the notion that Bond is outmatched and loses control because of ""the Russian woman."" And it's just too hard to see Bond falling for her, given how she's protrayed by Bianchi. Too bad.Red Grant, by contrast, is an all-time great. Of all Bond villains (especially the vastly overrated ""Jaws""), he's about the best."
5,A Brilliant Movie from Start to Finish...,"From Russia with Love certainly deserves the rank after Goldfinger and Thunderball as it's One of the Very Best Bond Movies. Most part of it remained true to the Novel which was very pleasant to watch. Q was introduced in this Movie and Connery really does some of his best work of his Bond ever. Daniela Bianchi who played Tatyana Romanova, the Russian Agent is surely one of the Top 5 Bond Girls. Robert shaw displays the perfect shades of the cunning character of Red Grant. The Briefcase remains the most memorable gadget ever used in a Bond Movie. It was Equipped with a Throwing Knife, 50 Gold Sovereigns, 20 rounds of Ammunition, an AR7 Sniper's rifle and a canister of tear gas. The plot is perfect and the most enjoyable scene is the Fight between Bond and Red Grant aboard the Orient Express. I'd highly recommend this Movie to everyone and any Bond Fan should not miss this one at any cost. The Movie is worth the Price."
4,Good,I have the movie From Russia with Love. Is it in demand? I'd like to have the video of the original one.
5,Best Bond,"The second of the Bond films and probably the best. Exotic locations, dangerous bad guys and woman, Connery in top form. The characters actually have depth in this one. Still a great film after 35 years."
2,Lusitania: Dense and Plodding,"Author David Ramsay's account of the sinking of The Lusitania is one of a glut of maritime disaster books to appear in recent years (and, indeed, was released almost simulateously with Diana Preston's book on this particular disaster). Obviously, this is a hot publishing trend. Alas, it is also one that could stand better editing. Ramsay gamely provides the full sweep of The Lusitania tragedy, including detailed accounts of the political intrigue that surrounded it. Unfortunately, his prose is so, uh, lifeless, that the book is barely readable. Ramsay's approach might be fine for historians, but readers who are looking for the kind of lively narrative history that has become so popular recently should look elsewhere."
4,100 quart cooler,The item arrived in a timely manner and its a quality purchase. Its keeps ice just like advertised. I am very satisafied with it. It has lots of room and is easy to carry with sturdy handles.LC.
4,Can You See Beauty in Ugliness! (Lou Reed/Andy Warhol),"Hal Hartley is annoying as a director. Fed on the cotton candy of Hollywood conventional narrative we initially recoil from his parody of the mentor/author relationship. It is overlong, built around a series of anti-climaxes, and is sometimes didactic. Nevertheless, it is engaging. At the center of this engagement lies scenes where serious emotional trauma tangles with the idiotic, surreal or profane. This erupts into a humour as black as anything in Jim Jarmusch's ""Dead Man"", and while it cannot carry the whole film it does help endear it to us. By the end of the two hours plus you are left tested and ehausted, but with an odd sense of catharsis, and cannot help but wonder: 'what was that beauty amongst all that ugliness?'"
1,"Self absorbed, overacted, pseudo artistic drivel",This movie is totally unbearable to watch. Mr. Hartley needs a healthy dose of reality: a white middle class poet-garbageman in Queens?
3,Do not get if you want to go in depth,The book was good for the basics of setting it up and getting started. The problem is that if you want to learn more pratical ways of using the machine it's best to watch the video that came along with the product.
2,"Why Paul, Why?","I remember when I was 13 years old and I got my first iron maiden cd for X-mas, ""Best of the beast"". By far, the tracks which featured Paul Di'anno were my favorites. Soon after, I purchased all the Iron Maiden cds.I've not purchased many other albums that featured Paul Di'anno, but I got this one, and I regret it. This album is funny, in a weird masochistic way. When I listen to this cd, all that comes into my head is ""Will make music for food!"". There is some real terrible cover songs, some AOR sounding songs, generic ballady type stuff, and the 92837982 rehash of iron maiden tracks which Paul seems to like to put onto every cd he releases. From what I gather from reading his book, ""The Beast"", he was most likely drunk or high on cocaine while recording these. It shows.Please look over this CD and track down ""Paul Di'anno's battlezone"" cds. They are much better than this filth."
3,dumb,"This is purple. It matches the on-screen color perfectly. But the touch is awful. I had hoped for the warmth and softness of the wool blankets I've had at my yoga studios. But no. This is scratchy, like Grandma's wool sweater. I recommend looking elsewhere. Or better yet, buy a wool yoga blanket in a store if you can so you can touch it first -- makes a huge difference. I felt dumg when I got this...I shouldn't have ordered wool without ""test driving"" it in a store."
1,Not in English...was returned.,It was returned cause it wasn't in english...It was in English sub-titles. Would not recomend it unless you don't mind reading sub-titles.
4,She can grab you,"I remember hearing Gloria Lynne years ago--and that's about all. It's good to learn she's a trouper, still performing, because even if the voice isn't quite as nimble and smooth, it's acquired a ""soulful grain"" that leaves an impression. Even though she won the same talent contest at Harlem's Apollo as singers like Ella and Sarah, she's definitely not in their league. Yet she's fearless about taking a song exclusively associated with Sarah--""Snowbound""--and taking us places with it. Unlike Sarah, she doesn't produce a coloratura aria on individual notes, but the ""beat"" is more apparent and the feeling especially persuasive. ""Here we are, helplessly snowbound""--""so deep is our love."" Hers is a ""big"" voice. It reaches out, grabs you, and pulls you into its depth. It doesn't hurt that the pianist is Mike Renzi, who simply has no equal as an accompanist these days."
1,haven't received it YET!!! Since 1/02/11 to now,I recieved The Lost Symbol but the other book I ordered on the same day for my wife is not here yet - both ordered on 1/02/11 and not received yet. Disappointing.
4,Does not wok on Vista,"The item was found among the games suitable for Vista on the Amazon. However, some of the functions do NOT work on Vista as they do on XP.It is not a problem of the manufacturer as the product cover does not say it works on Vista. But I purchased and opened it because it was shown on Amazon as compatible with Vista. I suggest Amazon makes that clear.The game works great on XP, though."
4,Old Fashion Toy brings current fun,Saw this toy advertised on Amazon and it looked like a classic toy every child should have
4,Quirkie,"I saw this movie years ago. It is a little quirkie, but has a nice sappy ending, and I love sappy endings. Plus I think Anne Archer is sexy, so that always helps."
4,Hokey Hero scores Large,"Alright, I admit, it is a hokey movie and the dialog is stilted. It was made for tv ...so what do you want? John Ritter is delightfully sappy as the hopefull Hero who believes that good always triumphs over evil.Anne Archer is enticing as the neighbor not even the good guy can resist. The movie revels in its simplicity but manages some scenes that are close to movie classics. There is even a scene that no matter how many times I see it still makes me tear up, and as a 55 year old male the only thing that brings me to tears these days is politics. Its fun, start the popcorn and order it."
1,"Okay, but it needs more Human Resource Letters",I am an Executive Human Resources Assistant. I need letters to nicely turn away candidates for jobs. I need a variety. This book does not offer more than 2 samples in this area. I did not find it very useful at all in that regard.
1,did not get the book,"I ordered this book for my husband's birthday. I ordered on March 2, 2008 and had it shipped normal delivery. I never arrived. How do I get my money back--its hard to believe that with an old rare book like this you would not use shipping that could track it.I am very unhappy with this transaction."
1,"Sid Freeman says ""i am a man""","IF i were the cardboard king this album would not be aloud to disgrace the wonderful noise of Monkees. I like ice cream, it comes in a cardboard box."
5,Heaviest Non-Ozzy Album,"Although I am a big fan of all Sabbath eras,this is by far their best non-Ozzy album.It has the crushing bass,screaming guitar,and the demonic drone of the old Sabbath.Dio's albums were great,and heavy,but this album will go down as a metal classic.Gillian's voice was perfect and complimented the heaviness of the tracks.This album is truly a great buy and a classic for any metal collection."
2,Defaced cover artwork and misleading advertising,"Like all Black Sabbath and Uriah Heep remasters released by Castle between 1996 and 1998, this 1983 masterpiece featured a sticker on the front which stated ""faithfully restored artwork"". Unfortunately, the cover artwork on these releases was in most cases very badly reproduced, with grainy printing and wrong colors. In ""Born Again"", the purpleish background was printed as a far lighter shade of blue, completely different to the original LP artwork. I've always considered the cover artwork as much a part of an album as its musical content, so I can only rate this release as an unacceptable insult to the band and their fans."
3,Saucy Jack,"This album always reminds me of Spinal Tap, especially when St. Hubbins and Derek Smalls are sitting there talking about their next projects, saying ""yeah who wants to see a bunch of old farts cranking out the same mediocre headbanging bullsh*t,"" well..."
2,Five stars? You must be joking!,"Yeah, I love Sabbath, and also listened to their albums with great will to like them, even when theyre nothing more than ""Tony Iommi Project"".To rate BORN AGAIN as a five or four stars album must be a joke. The album has the dubious merit of possessing one of the worst album covers ever, and also the worst production for a Black Sabbath album. It's muddy, plain and simple. It has only seven songs, and I agree that they are heavy as hell, really, really dark.TRASHED opens it with a bang, and I just love the song. Gillan is singing all the album with the top of his lungs, his voice sounding strong and clear. But the songs simply don't take off. Sometimes they are painfully dragged (""Zero The Hero"", ""Disturbing The Priest"") sometimes downward silly (""Hot Line"", ""Digital Bitch"") Given a better production, this album had potential. The way it came out, it's just a black mark in Sabbath's career."
2,WRONG STEP,"A lot of people below don't know what they are talkingabout. Iommi and GIllan own opinion is that this album [is no good]! Look at the cover art ! THen look the mixing which is horrible, the sounds are all together, with Gillan's voice well below. It is a record below Sabbath's standard, an album to be forgotten forever, with the exception of ""Trashed"", an astonishing gripping tune."
2,Lousy production...,"Whatever merits this album has, they were buried in the absolutely obnoxious production, the worst of Black Sabbath career.For those who say this is great, I must remind you that Iommi himself confessed that this would be a new project, and not a Sabbath album, but the record company did not aloud it.Also, it marked the beginning of the chair dancing that Sabbath would become, when led exclusively by Iommi.As for the songs, TRASHED is by far the best. IT's like a thunder on the roll, strong, powerful, like a snowball going downhill and sweapting everything aside!! BORN AGAIN is also very good.The trouble, I repeat, is the production. no more comments."
3,Still sounds horrible but worth it for the live disc,I bought this mistakenly thinking it was a remaster of the admittedly horrid sounding original disc. Well that's not the case as reportedly the original masters were lost making a re-master impossible. The good news is its a GREAT album! Very nearly as good as the Dio years. Also you get a kicka** live disc that makes this worth the price of admission.
1,This is just not any good...,"""Born Again"" may be Black Sabbath's weakest album. The production is so bad that it's almost impossible to kind of talk about the actual songs. I guess some of the tracks would be much better with a proper production, at least we might be able to hear the different instruments and not only this ""blur"" that sounds like a very bad demo tape. If you're not a dedicated Sabbath (or Ian Gillan) fan, stay away from this one. If you are... I guess you already own this album..."
1,Rating ( 0 stars),"I have been listening to metal since its birth. (which is Judas Priests first album) and I liked a lot of Black Sabbaths stuff. Mob Rules and Heaven and Hell are Classics ! This one is obviously their worst release.and It also is one of the worst releases that I have ever heard by anyone I can remember in the past 20 years. This is just plain gross. Nothing appealing about it at all. I respect the band but facts are facts ,All good things must come to a end , this album is the season the veteran Quarterback wishes he would have retired the year before."
1,Complete Garbage,"I brought the sample size at Wal-Mart for $1.00 or so, thank god I didn't invest in a full-size. It says its for daily use, but I find that hard to believe. This stuff dries my skin out like no other product ive used. It has exfoliating beads in it that are way too harsh for my face. If you insist in getting this, set aside some money for a moisturizer, you'll need it."
2,Not Enough Objects and Unrealistic Bread Texture,"This toy does not look like the picture at all. The bread, tomato, and lettuce were all hard. The only parts that are a bit realistic are the cheese and meats. This toy came with only one tomato and one lettuce. That's not enough objects to make multiple full sandwiches. I would recommend not buying this toy if you want your money's worth."
5,Best play food I've found!,"This line of play food is the very best that I've found. It isn't hard plastic like most sets. The lunch meat, cheese, and lettuce are ""floppy"", and the tomato and bread have texture. You can see the imperfections in the paint on the bread but for the money it's well worth it. I've search hard to find quality play food like I had when I was little. The baking set is awesome, too!"
2,Worth a Read for New Parents,There are some helpful suggestions in this book.The layout of the book is good for busy parents.The humor the author uses throughout helps ease anxiety about the subject matter.I suggest purchasing some page tabs to secure throughout the book while reading.
2,Good for 1 day... but what about after??,"Its great for that 1 day - makes potty training so exciting and fun. And definitely can see the appeal for kids who have negative views on potty training. BUT what about after?? The books barely talks about how to reinforce it, how to phase out treats and stickers, how to get them to tell you when they need to go as opposed to telling htem when they need to go.Also - its an EXPENSIVE way to potty train for sure!! So this book is good... but get another one one how to maintain potty training after."
3,Limited use,This book has a great concept but will only work if your child understands what a party is and is excited by it!
5,Fast,"Fast, would use again. My son loved the book. Description was accurate. I am very please with the product. Thanks"
1,terrible,"If you are a student and buying this book, I recommend a different teacher and a different book. This book is so repetitive. Someone could write this book in 1/10 of what the author uses. It makes me want to bang my head into a wall. This is one of the worst books I have ever read in college."
5,Don and Martha Do It Again!,"Another stellar effort by the pioneers of one-to-one. This book tackles CRM on several different fronts, and includes thoughtful pieces from a range of expert contributors. The book features both tactics and theory, including a helpful history on the emergence of CRM as a major business philosophy and some of the original research behind relationship theory. A hefty reference, and a useful one!"
1,Cannot recommend this book,"I bought this book for a course called ""Customer Relations in Business."" The material does not appear to have been edited as there are numerous grammatical errors. The index is poorly done and does not always refer you to the right page. The authors' use of marketing-specific acronyms is excessive and slows down the reading. On a personal level I cannot condone what this book advocates ... collecting information on customers with or without their knowledge or consent for the purposes of manipulating them. In short it treats customers as a means and not as an end."
3,Funny,"Liked the movie, but I saw it already and couldn't remeber it ... so it didn't stick ... Still, I liked the chatting and the view on nightlife in England ... It's nice"
4,Proud pfaltzgraff owner,"Aspen platter is large, attractive completion to my set-can be used as a serving piece with other styles as well-I get compliments each time I have company."
4,open them!,"This album starts off in a way that mimicks the way you would sound like if you were popping it into the cd player. With the lead vocalist begging you, no daring you, no hypnotizing you to open her you almost fall into listening to this album like you would begin to fall asleep. Much like a Freddy Kruger nightmare it almost is sweet and rosey until you realize something is not right and all of a sudden your arms fall off and in place of them are roach like tentacles. Put simply this band rocks and the complexity of the emotions thrown at you by Raiana make it all worth the time it took to listen to it."
1,Sure you have to see it BUT...,"It's a let down. It's Brosnan's Moonraker. But what the hay, it's a Bond film you have to see it. If you collect the films you have to buy it."
2,worst bond ever,"This has got to be the worst James Bond movie ever made. All it is is a constant overflow of chessey one-liners(too many even for a Bond flick). I will admit that it does have some well-executed action scenes, which is why i gave it 2 stars instead of 1. And, i also must say, not to sound perverted, but the girls in this bond flick are the hottest of 'em all. (...)"
2,The World is Not Enough,"This film was ok. It didn't have all the background on the opening scene, especially with the water chase. They didn't let you in on any of the gizmo's until after that! I think ""Q"" is one of the best actors! Informing not only Bond but the audiance of what 007 will be using. Now it appears ""Q"" is going to be replaced by John Clease. I dunno, I think he is cool but he just dosen't fit the role of ""Q"" to me."
2,One of the worst Bond Films,"I love bond films, but this one I don't love. The characters were even more shallow than normal and there weren't any cool gadgets. Also the bad guys were't up to par when compared to other bond bad guys."
1,Complete flop,"Not worth adding to your library, even if you're building a Bond one. The story is unclear,the gadgets poor, Sophie Marceau's acting artificial and immature,the stunts pale in comparison to previous Bonds, and the humour just not there anymore. Pressure to get a movie out on the back of previous titles. Just not worth the money, I'm willing to sell mine for half the price..."
3,buy only if desperate for complete 007 collection,"The tribute to Q in the begining was great. I'll miss him terribly. Brosnan wasn't as charming as he was in ""The Thomas Crown Affair"", and his performance seems strained, but he did the best he could with supporting actors like Denise Richards. Denise Richards appears to be there only as a pretty face. Her acting was stocky and boring! It ruined the wonderful story that was developing cause I wanted to just wish her silent. Just stand there getting wet in that white t-shirt. That's probably the only reason the director casted her for after her ""Wildthings"" movie. Sophie Marceau was fantastic! I loved her performance--seductive, wicked and total contrast to Richard's. Perhaps Richards and the first female villian should have changed characters. Atleast the villian died with style."
4,Almost perfect,"The only thing that could have made this movie more perfect isif Sean Connery himself could have played the roll! I mean, don't getme wrong, Peirce Brosnan is one great actor, but you just don't get any better then Sean! This is one of those movies that are definately worth buying!..."
4,"Not as good as Goldeneye, but much better than Tomorrow...","With a cool overture (the adventure before the title), a well performed song by Garbage, and a great cast of characters, The World is Not Enough is one of the best Bond flicks yet. Brosnan is back with his new P99 pistol and lots of new gadgets and car. He's assigned to protect a billionare's daughter who's targeted for murder. But is she all that she turns out to be? Though the story gets confusing and the bad guy is pretty lame, the action sequences make up for that. It is worth buying if you like Bond. 4 stars."
1,BOND FOR SPORTSFANS,Several people have said this is the best Bond of all. That's roughly the equivalent of being the best hockey player in all of Equador or the best ballerina since Mickey Mantle! Are they kidding?If they make another one like this (especially featuring that weenie little Brosnan guy) it will have to debut on local channel 3 in Klamath Falls!
5,THE BEST!!!!,This Movie Was Tottaly Awsome! Everything Looked So Real! Buy Or Rent This Movie On DVD! It's Great!
3,"A good, but not great bond.","As a film, this was the weakest of the Brosnan movies, in my view. Denise Richards is so talentless, she detracts from every scene she is in.The whole movie is worth watching for Desmond Llewelyn's eerily prescient final performance.For any serious Bond fan, you're going to buy the movie anyway. If you're not a big Bond fan, this movie probably isn't worth owning.I found the DVD quality to be excellent on the transfer. The contrast was unusually high (I'm often disappointed by the ""black"" on the screen), and the image was crisp throughout, without some of the color gradients you often see in low contrast environments."
2,007 goes overboard,"As much as I like bond films, this is one of the worst to date. Several of the action sequences are flat out unbelievable and silly. The plot is some of the craziest unimaginitive work ever put into a film. I had to force myself to sit down on three seperate occasions to finish this film! If you want a good bond film, definitley steer clear of this title. Try Goldeneye or Tommorow Never Dies."
3,Not the best Bond but worth a look,This wasn't up there with the best Bond films but is worth a look. Brosnan puts in another solid performance and Denise Richards looks as stunning as ever. A well directed film and some fantastic action sequences including a brilliant opening scene with a chase through the streets of London and staggering stunts at the Millenium Dome in Greenwich.
5,He&#65533;s back!,"Brilliant locations, beautiful babes, silly gadgets, best opening sequence ever! James is back bigger than ever with a cool villain, sophisticated love interest and disappointing co-star: Denise Richards although gorgeous looks more like a porno star than an atomic scientist. Pierce (sorry Mr. Bronson to me) is a fine Bond; he really does make him a believable character, handsome and tough with just the touch of humor. It was very poignant to watch as 007 said farewell to ""Q"" as we now know for the last time. You know the plot mad person intent to wreak havoc, good guy saves the world, but has an interesting twist that I didn't see coming. I don't think that it is the best but certainly in the top three. I wonder if in the next movie (cant wait already) if ""R"" can teach him to leave a building via the door? Great entertainment!"
2,Disappointing,"The World is Not Enough marks the 19th James Bond film and Pierce Brosnan's third installment in the role. Beginning with a slam bang action sequence (one of the best in the series) the film goes downhill from there as the plot gets more and more formulatic, even for James Bond standards. There are a few plot twists and turns that make for wholesome surprises, but in the end The World is Not Enough is one of the most disappointing films in the long running series. Robert Carlyle's (Trainspotting, Ravenous) Renard, a villian who is impervious to pain, is a nice touch, as is the beautiful Sophie Marceau (Braveheart) as the treacherous Elektra King, but the casting of Denise Richards as a nuclear physiscist (yes, you read that right) is one of many low points of the film (even though she looks severely hot in her short shorts and tight tank top ensemble). All in all, this is one of the more disappointing films in the series; the followup Die Another Day is much better."
5,Best bond so far...,"The world is not enough is one of the best bonds i have seen so far. The only problem with this movie is it was cut a bit short and needs to go a bit longer but with denise richards and the great Pierce Brosnan starring in this movie you can't really complain.and even though Brosnan is ageing a bit, he still should be Bond becuase he suits the character very well"
2,What were they thinking!,"The action was great. Locations exotic. Plot believable. Charactors interesting, with the exception of one. Chrismas Jones. When did she start her study of advanced nuke physics? In the womb? Good lord! The director should have made her a mute advanced nuke wiz kid. Whenever she opened her mouth, bad lines, along with bad acting, would spill out. The only reason she was in the film was because of her sweat body. Her roll in the film detracted from the films seriousness and, I my opinion, ranks ""The World is Not Enough"" as the number 2 Bond stinker right after ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" with George Lazenby. Don't know that Bond movie? Thats because it was so bad nobody will talk about it. They just want to forget it ever existed. Which is what I will try to do with ""The World is Not Enough."" That is if I can't remove the Denise Richards (Chrismas Jones) scenes without destroying the overall plot line. I need to get busy."
3,The World is not Enough,"What can I say, I was so disapointed when I saw it in the theatres. It's not really a bad movie, but for most people I've talked to, was hardly anything they were expecting. The DVD is nicely done, though it would have been nice to have deleted scenes (I'm sure they exsist) in there. It's a Bond film, but after the gadgets and action of Tomorrow Never Dies, this seems like a step back for Bond. But a step up for Brosnin as he gives a great performance."
3,Is it Really Bond?,"James Bond is back again in yet another action packed film, but does it really live up to the previous movies? In my opinion it does not, but dont get me wrong its still a great movie. If you liked goldeneye and tmnd don't expect twine to be as good and thrilling."
4,Shaken and Stirred,"""The World Is Not Enough"" is a high-class 007-Thriller with a good story and plenty of action. After the very disappointing ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", the 19th Bond features a splendid Brosnan, superb sets and another boring ski-chase. I'm really looking forward to the next 007 adventure."
1,the big rip off company,I am a professional teacher of young children's string instruments. I ordered this cello because of the information on the web page. It was such a disater when it arrived. I set it up did every thing possible to try to get a decent sound from the small cello. It was comparable to a Walmart toy guitar. The company would not refund all of my money and it was an emotional scene with many nasty e-mails from them. Amazon took good care of me. I would never reconment buying any thing from this company ever!!
2,Beautiful Sweaters-Bad Instructions,"This book has really nice sweaters in it, but there are errors in the book so beware!!! The sweater featured on the cover tells you to use US size 5 knitting needles which can not be true since the pattern for the sailboat sweater (page 83)uses the same type yarn and gauge but tells you to use US size 3 needles. After knitting the star sweater (cover) with the US 5 it is obvious that there is a typo. I ripped the sweater out and reknitted with the US 3. What a waste of time!Also the star sweater and sailboat sweater have inconsistencies with the number of stitches you should have left at the neckband so you have to figure out some work around for those errors as well. I only have experience with those two patterns in the book and have found both of them to have mistakes. If you purchase this book I would recommend reading the pattern carefully so you can plan ahead. This book is not for beginners and can prove to be very frustrating."
4,I love this book,"I love this book. So far I have knitted the pirate sweater for my nephew, the ballet cardigan and the mary janes booties. I bought the recommended yarn for the jumper but happily substituted local yarns for the other things. The mary Janes are fabulous, and I have even made adult sized ones using 12ply (aran?) with only minor changes to the pattern! There was a minor problem with the pattern for the pirate jumper (check the sizing for 3-4 years) but I emailed the publisher and recieved a prompt and apologetic response. There is also a problem with the needle size recommended for the star jumper, and although this is unfortunate it is also a reminder to test gauge too. This is a really sweet collection of babies and kids knits."
2,Adorable Knits for Tots,"I was less than favorably impressed with this book. The best pattern in the book is on the front cover, and what's inside I found to be disappointing. Sorry author!Janice Lawson - Montana"
2,"Sadly, this is the last ZM book I'll buy...","...Unless I'm convinced they've gotten their act together. I am currently about to begin the Lacy Sweater for the third time due to a giant errata. This was not a matter of a single missing stitch, but of a rep instruction that specified half as many as were actually needed (as in said 7, needed 14). This is just plain sloppy.Because neither the author nor the publisher had an errata page, I assumed I was doing something weird. After the second start, I became suspicious enough to go digging, and found the errata posted by a knit blogger who'd pegged away at the publisher.For what they charge for these books, I expect better QA. And ZM, would an errata page kill you?"
2,Ugh...,"I, like most of America, was really excited to read the follow-up to Ms. Wells' previous books. I rarely buy hardcover books, but this time, I couldn't wait. Well, I should have. While I won't rehash the ""plot"" (there really wasn't much of one), I can say that I was extremely disappointed in this book. I believe that the thing that is missing is a true narrative thread. There is nothing that prevents the novel from jarring from one place to the next. It almost feels like Ms. Wells didn't want to write another Ya-Ya book, but felt she HAD to. I didn't feel the love for her characters that I felt in the previous books. It seemed that she has tired of them and had to work very hard to come up with more of their stories. I gave the book 2 stars because while it was tedious, it isn't the worst thing I've read. I hope that Ms. Wells takes a chance in her next novel and hopefully creates some more memorable characters instead of rehashing the old ones."
3,I didn't love it......,"While i did enjoy this book somewhat...i agree with the other reviewers that it wasn't quite up to snuff with the first two books. I did enjoy the storyline with Sidda, Little Shep,Lulu and Baylor...the rest was just filler and gave me a slight headache."
1,TERRIBLE,"I loved the first YaYa book, enjoyed the second, and hated this one. It had no story, it resembled a book of short stories but not enjoyable ones. Clearly the author just wanted to make some quick money or something, I can't think of another reason why she would have written this. I had liked and cared about the characters, and in this book I couldn't stand any of them."
1,Stop the insanity,The original Ya-Ya novel was a delight. This one is stretching the first (and second) books very thinly (and badly.)I wouldn't even finish the first quarter of the book it was so boring. Sad.I'm tired of the same characters. Want some new ones.
1,Terribly disappointing...,"I hate to echo everyone else here, but I have to agree, this new Ya-Ya book is very disappointing. I did find the beginning a bit interesting, learning about how the Ya-Ya's met was fun, but things went from mediocre in the first half of the book to just boring in the second half. I found myself thinking of finishing the book as a chore, a huge turnaround from the joy of reading the first two. I don't know if Wells was pressured into writing this, but it seems like the Ya-Ya well has definitely run dry.The writing and poor editing actually made me cringe at times.How very sad that characters who once seemed so different and new now feel like shadows, rehashing old stories."
2,Waste of time,I was expecting a lot more because I loved the first two books so much. I think Wells should have quit while she was ahead.
2,Disappointing and a waste of time!,"I am disappointed with this book. Although the book is short and should have been an easy read, I could not read more than 2 or 3 pages each night before it put me to sleep. The book is nothing more than a collection of random chapters that probably were cut from the previous two Ya-Ya books. I found myself skimming the last 100 pages, just so I could finish the book. This book is a waste of time and I will not be eager to pick up the next book from this author."
1,Terribly Disappointing......,"Just finished Ya-Ya's in Bloom and I must say that it's the most disappointing piece of fluff I've read in a long time. She was too lazy to even come up with new stories, they were all the old ones with different people in them, like the woman who's daughter ends up kidnapping a petite ya ya's kid. She just totally lost the edge and emotions that made the other two books so moving and it just ended up a stupid and extremely corny bunch of drivel...two thumbs down!!!This book is so bad she should be forced to return all of our money!!!"
3,Let the ya-ya's die on the vine pleeeze.....,"I forced myself to finish this book, but I have to say I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. It just dragged on and on. The end was a huge disappointment. Iam really surprised by Ms. Wells her last book was not like this at all. Do yourselves a huge favor and keep the Ya-Ya's in Thornton,Louisianna on the bargain basement shelve."
4,Classic Southern Literature,"I, too, liked this latest Wells novel and found some beautiful prose to read again and again. I believe that Rebecca Wells will join the ranks of important Southern novelists although her works are not ""deep"", thought-provoking tomes. Anyone who has lived in the South for more than ten minutes will identify with the characters and events portrayed in Ya Yas in Bloom and anyone who has read the other two novels will get to know these families even better through their children."
4,Better than most,This bigfoot video is way more entertaining than a lot of the drivel I have seen out there. Yuo know why? Because it's real people discussing their experiences and not some fabricated Hollywood version of the bigfoot phenomenon.
3,Bigfoot in Your Backyard,"Check out stories and evidence of the elusive Big Foot's presence in the wilds of Kentucky. Graphics, night vision footage and interviews, along with colorful graphics piece together a 200 year history of strange U.S. sightings."
5,Truly Amazing,Banjamin was very unique. His music is haunting truthful and raw. I listen to almost daily. He is orginal and this is my favorate cd. I remember him from the early days. Nothing could keep him down.I miss him. I also ordered the documenrty and Im still waiting for it. I recomend this cd to anyone that is into sadness turned to hummer and can appreciate the brilliants in the way the band comes together and the just how beautiful this music realy is - and how brilliant Benjamin was.
1,Don't bother with this one.,"Is someone ghost-writing BTB's books now? Or did someone ghost-write ""A Woman of Substance""? Almost every book after her 1st have been poorly (swiftly?) written. In this one, she brings lots of today's current issues to the fore, without much detail of any of them; e.g., breast cancer, ebola virus, incest, spousal & child abuse, Nazi-looted art work, bisexuality. Gee, what did she miss? Maybe only the Bill & Monica story! Her dialogue was unnatural (no one speaks like that!), her characters underdeveloped, & a too fairy tale-like ending. I should have known she was going downhill when I couldn't finish even a 1/4 of ""Angel"" & wondered if the same author had written ""Everything to Gain"" as ""Woman of Substance"". I stopped reading her after that one & should have stayed stopped!"
1,Why does she still get published?,"Barbara Taylor Bradford's Woman of Substance was so rich, so well written and so immediate, that the author's first effort made us believe everything that followed would be its equal. This, unfortunately, has not happened. In A Sudden Change of Heart, Bradford's characters are so well-off and so shallow in their daily lives that we do not believe they have the capacity to suffer in the midst of terminal illnesses or remembered past sadnesses. Bradford has steadily gone downhill. Finding myself skipping pages that were so predictable, I imagined Bradford really struggling to get through A Sudden Change of Heart simply to meet a deadline. No agent or publisher would even look at a manuscript like this if the author were not already established as the icon, Barbara Taylor Bradford."
5,Great item. Came in quickly.,Thank you for sending me this.It actually arrived way earlier than I thought.So I am very happy.
2,A Collection That's No Longer Useable,"I bought this CD back in 2003 whilst making a documentary and I found a couple of the tracks handy for drumloops, but otherwise it didn't prove to be very helpful. In an age of Garageband and Youtube, this collection is VERY dated.I give it 2 stars as I was able to incorporate some beats and sounds into my work, but I would steer clear of this as there are better resources out there now."
5,How Long?,"Kansas is great progressive rock. I think this is their greatest album. After ""Leftoverture"" they really made their way through. ""Point of Know Return"" is one of my favorite songs ever. ""Paradox"" is a great song and should have been in a collection. Also the instrumental ""The Spider"" is excellent. ""Portrait (He Knew)"" has exciting sounds. ""Dust in the Wind"" is the song which is probably the most played radio song even made by Kansas. I might be wrong but I think I've heard this peaceful song many times before. ""Sparks of the Tempest""? A great song for live gigs! Old Kansas is even better than old Genesis. The keyboard solos rule!Stars: Point of Know Return, Dust in the Wind, Paradox"
2,I wanted to love it but....,"I love the quality, love the space. But for some reason the bag slides around and always ends up resting on my hip. Two other family members had the same issue. And the thick strap around the front is not flattering."
4,Great Commute Pack,"This is a great commuter pack if your leaning toward bulk less. Material is light weight so take into cosideration what the contents will be carried in the pack, with that said the pack is very small and comfortable for the light commutes."
2,"I want to love it, but I don't","Overall the material is durable. I can fit a 16 oz. contigo coffee cup in the pouch. My iphone with otter box fits in the side pocket with flap, but not on the strap. The otter box makes the phone too big for this space. I have tried wearing this a few ways, none are real comfortable. The strap cuts into my neck. I like the size of the bag and pouches. My ipad with otter box fit in the big pouch but made the bag heavier than I'd like. My wallet fit just OK in the second largest pouch. My wallet is a trifold and the width didn't work real great. I didn't want to place it in the larger area's and rifle through stuff to get to it. I'm not comfortable putting my credit card and drivers license in the slots build into the bag. I wish the bottom had a different material to clean after setting it down in various places. I want to love it...but I don't. So, I have decided to return it."
4,"Baggallini Messenger Bagg, Black","This a good product, although you may find the material a bit cheap, but I think it's a strong one. Too many pockets are there. The product I have received is a bit different than what amazon is showing, but you can say it's close enough. It holds my Samsung Tab 8.9, but won't be able to fit my college A4 size notebook, I had to bend it. There is no protection in this bag for your laptop. The bag holds my lunch box (1 ltr. size), my Samsung tab 8.9, A4 notebook, a book, water bottle, coffee mug, cell phone, and some other accessories. No mp3 player socket. I like the bag."
4,Not as pictured,This is my third baggallini messenger bagg. I like the main compartment's roominess and the fact that I can wear the purse in front of me. My only disappointment is that the picture depicting the outside pocket is not bag I received (thus the 4 rating). I prefer my first two bags that had deeper and fewer pockets over this bag with more shallow (credit card) pockets.
5,This is a wonderful bag.,"I use this bag to tote my ""survival"" essentials for work and it is just perfect. It is deceptively compact - very accommodating and roomy. Plus it actually does sling over the shoulder and stay, I had another sling-type bag that never stayed put. I wish it came in a heavier material for winter use."
1,slippery and flimsy,"I can't believe I paid this much for a bag of such weird quality. The bag's material is flimsy and light, while the strap is heavy and bulky, made of something like seatbelt webbing, it's really slippery and falls off your shoulder. The bag looks much bigger in the picture than it really is. Not a messenger bag at all, more like a little purse - for those who actually need their bag to carry more than keys and a wallet, the large compartment is not really big enough. Also, the tomato red is really orange, not like the red in the photo. All in all I'm really sorry I bought this."
3,cute but not what I expected,its a cute book but I expected a book full of doodles and it has doodles butit is how to turn stick figure letters A-Z into a work that starts with that letter.Say you write a z and then turn that z into an entire drawing of a zebra. Itis a cute idea but not a book full of random doodles like I thought it would be.
2,It rusts,"If you plan to use this caddy for a month, then this is for you. It fitted nicely in my bathtub but I had to deal with rust flakes all over the shower after a few weeks."
4,Great price for some great films.,Not a big fan of Superman but Goodfellas and The Departed are exceptional films and Blazing Saddles is decent entertainment.
3,Look at your Syllabus first - Or plan on buying 2 Study Aids,"This book does not cover all the topics we did in first year torts. It is EXTREMELY helpful for some of the larger areas, however. I got the highest grade in my torts class and could not have done it without this book's help with some of the more complex areas of negligence (negligence per se, causation in fact, proximate cause, etc.) and the section in the end on how to take a torts final. If you can get one cheap, intend to buy more than one aid, or your syllabus fits the material covered well the chapters on negligence and taking torts finals make this book well worth it."
5,Good book - great seller,"Glannon simply knows what he's going, so much so that a 0L like me can understand this text. I'm confident this will help me greatly during the semester.Good seller: great condition and prompt shipping."
5,3rd Edition = awesome.,For some reason I think Amazon's reviews bleed through different editions.IE. You will find reviews of the 1st/2nd edition on the 3rd editions page. This often misleads and/or distorts the promotion of a product.The newest editions of examples & explanations are fabulous and settle a few issues that may have been present in the past. All to often students expect these to be comprehensive outlines like Emanuels that do all the work for them---no. The grades come to those who work and that is where this series shines. It gives you practice and furthers understanding.
4,one of the great blues pianists,"A fine introduction to one of the great Blues pianists, the eminent pupil of Roosevelt Sykes. Twenty-five of the best tracks recorded in his heyday between 1940 and 1948. Memphis Slim was guitarist Big Bill Broonzy's pianist of choice, and he had a fine Blues voice too. The songs range from risque humour to true lowdown Blues. There are a couple of good talking Blues, reminiscent of Nat King Cole's work at the same time, and a nod to the contemporary Jump Blues of Louis Jordan. This is the peak of Chicago Blues when Muddy Waters arrived in the windy city to electrify us all."
5,More great music from the legendary Stephen Stills,"some more of what we have come to know from one the finest guitar players and song writers of our time. A couple of great covers, a tune by Bob Dylan ( Hollis Brown ) and Harry Nilsson's Everybody's Talk'in At Me. A nice mix of up tempo and mellow acoustic tunes. If your a Stills fan, you might want to consider this for your collection. END"
4,Just shows you what you can do when you check your ego,"I thought Stills was effecting the whiskey voice when I first heard this disc, but in fact, his voice was near shot. Funny, Dylan would come to later ape this vocal delivery at the close of the twentieth century.Anyway, there are moments of genius here that you wish Stills would take note of and perhaps fashion as a career direction. His take on ""Bluebird,"" and ""Blind Fiddler"" are genius. His composition ""Treetop Flyer"" a thing of wonder. The whole disc comes off all the better for his keepin it simple, acoustic and sublime. He seemed to be competing with no one, and as a result, he simply articulates poetry. The guitar playing is memorable, and often a testament to how protean he could be when he was not trying.If you are a fan of acoustic music in any respect, this is a worthy addition to your collection. Shame he couldn't exorcise the raging ego for good........."
1,Poor Introduction,"This little book is neither a good introduction nor clear. To his credit, unlike other scholars writing on the topic of Thomistic moral philosophy, McInerny does not use technical or rare words in which to impress others with his knowledge. However, he writes in question form and somewhat like he is trying to write a work of fiction, not philosophy. His sentences are hard to follow. Again, it is not a matter of depth. He is not speaking over anyone's head... He has kept his ideas simple in attempts to make them available to the general public. However, if one does not already possess a working knowledge of Natural Law, then one is very likely to get confused by his writing style, in which one could get lost in his little scenerios and rhetorical type questions leaving the beginner wondering what exactly the point is. If you are a beginner and really want a good introduction, then I recommend, ""Thomistic Renaissance - The Natural Moral Law"" by Rev. John Trigilio, Jr."
2,You should already have all these tracks,"When I first heard about the import version, I was curious as to what the ""Dub Instrumental"" mix of THTF was. I figured that it was an all-instrumental version of the Dub Mix, and searched around various forums to confirm this, but couldn't find anything.I bit the bullet, and picked it up last week. As it turns out, The Hand That Feeds (Dub Instrumental Mix) is the exact same track, vocals and everything, as the Dub mix from the Hand That Feeds single -- it's not a new track.Only die-hard fans are going to want to get this EP, and if you're a die-hard fan, you should already have all these tracks. Save yourself $20 and pick up the US version instead -- there's nothing to see here."
5,a travel inside your concience,"No one can write so touchable words for songs like Trent Reznor, and no one can show it thanks to magnificent music. Try, you won't regret."
4,not to shabby,buy this and do not buy the hand that feeds or only single. the el-p mix of only is one of the better nin remixes ever. Its really to bad the hand that feeds remixes were already on singles.
5,The A-Team Season 5 The Final Season,This is the final season of the a-team one of the 80's best shows. i can understand them stopping at only five seasons. but this season was just as good as the others. this show will forever be remembered. the best episode in this season areepisodes.1. dishpan man2. trial by fire3. firing line5. the theory of revolution6. the say uuncle affair7. alive at five8. family reunion9. point of no return10. the crystal skull11. the spy who mugged me12. the grey team13. without reservationsif you have not seen this season yet then i recommend you do
1,SHATTERED! Exploded! BEWARE!,"I just bought this here a little while ago - turns out pyrex is NO LONGER made of the same product. I poured hot water into it, and it exploded into shattered shards all over my kitchen, I burned my leg and foot.BUYER BEWARE. PYREX SHATTERS."
3,Gold digger's fable,"This forgettable film can be summed up in four lines:When marrying for moneyExpensive clothes and carsIt's better not to bare your heartTo creepy guys in bars- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Why you should watch this movie:1. Halle Berry2. A very young Clive OwenWhy you should skip this movie:1. Horrible plot2. Holes in aforementioned horrible plot3. You need ANOTHER reason?Rated: 2.5 starsAmanda Richards, November 5, 2007"
2,This book isn't as great as it seems,"Well , i bought this book, thinking there would be really great spells in it. But, it wasn't all that great.. for some people it probablay would be good, but none of them i had a specific need for.... This isn't a book for kids OR teenagers. Not because it is bad or is Black magic, because for young people they are dumb... teens into the craft(well i know one) are into clumsy spells & such, or love spells, (this one has love spells..but they weren't what she was looking for) don't get me wrong, it's a great book for older people, just not younger..... It's a good book but like they say: don't judge a book by it's cover.... It's not as great as it seems!!"
5,music for Elevators,"The GUY can sing I loved it. I am a big fan!! Can I just say wow. very song was the best ... Talk to you , We can work it out and babies are just the best songs..."
4,Music for Anywhere,"There's nothing better for a music lover than to take a chance on a CD that you know little about and have it turn into one of your favorites. Music for Elevators provides soothing, intriguing music with poetic lyrics that will grab you by the heart and give a good pull. Anthony Stewart Head's voice blends beautifully into the instrumentals creating a package that is exotic and soulful, and that opens up a vacation for the mind. Close your eyes and let this music carry you away. You won't find many moments like this in your life. Music for Elevators truly is music for anywhere and any time."
3,Really is Music for Elevators,"Head has a great voice and obvious musicianship and musicality but I really wish he had produced songs with a greater range of pace and emotion. Monotonously introspective, this CD could have benefitted greatly from some faster paced, rockier tunes. He could have even included tracks he played in the series. Variety would have added much needed spice."
1,Not what I had expected,"Terrible, nothing like you hear on The Buffy ""Once more with Feeling"" musical."
5,Excellent movie,This is a really great Western movie. Great story and lots of action and adventure. Worth watching over and over.
2,Quite boring,"This is one of those movies that's so boring it's a chore to watch. I'm just seeing snippets between internet surfing and reading. Selleck looks okay, but he just doesn't have what it takes to carry this kind of film. Far as I'm concerned, his show was a bore too. The only memorable part is some disturbing footage of the young lady shooting a pack of dingos and that was painful to watch. The stuff with the aborigines - just the usual pile of Hollywood dung.I recomend this movie for people who are infatuated with Tom Selleck. There seems to be quite a few of them. Everyone else should find a real western to watch."
5,A classic western - topsy turvey,"""This ain't no Winchester 74 and you aren't Jimmy Stewart"" ... No, this is the Sharps 1874 and this is Tom Selleck... both great westerns where the rifle is as much a main character as the people and the vital supporting actor. Both are classic movies. What I really enjoy in Quigley is everything is upside down... where the good guys are the natives, the bad guys are the ranchers and cavalry, and the single shot buffalo gun is the equalizer... in the hands of a good shot.The ending showdown is one of the greatest in westerns. For the first time viewer, let the moment flow... even in reruns it never gets old. The western lives on and the fight between good and evil .. in a foreign land ... is both timeless and universal... Wyoming is just a little north of Melbourne."
5,Tom Selleck,A different kind of western! The story line is good and Tom Selleck his usual great self!
1,Not the correct region for DVD players,"DVD arrived promptly and in good order, however, due to Australia being in the Oceania region our DVD players cannot play US type DVDs. Amazon did warn me that this was a possibility - however, no option was given by Amazon to choose a DVD for this region - Oceania. I am stuck with a DVD I cannot watch"
1,Great comedy,"You will be laughing your tail off. Here is why:Quigley (Tom Selleck), investigates a report on human right violations by the English settlers against the aboriginal population of Austria.(Obviously, Quigley had improved the inter-racial relationships in his native Wyoming to perfection: black, indians, white, all live in equality, peace and harmony, and now he is on a mission to do the same in Austria)Quigley quickly discovers the horrible truth, and being a superman, supperherro, suppersshooter, quickly brings justice. All bad guys (english, irish, scotch) are punished, aboriginals are free. No more slavery, genocide, collonialism and exploitation.A blond Texan woman shares his passion and adopts a little black baby; the baby fell from a 200 feet cliff and survived!Have fun!Ernesto Ce Gevara"
4,Great old-fashioned Western,"Classic style, great performances by Selleck and Rickman. A fantastic Saturday afternoon matinee. This is the sort of movie we're meant to enjoy with a bucket of popcorn."
5,The sound is amazing...,"I got this as part of my entertainment system. Once I set it all up, the sounds is so realistic that we think that we are inside the movies or tv shows. Sometimes it too creepy to have sounds that sound so real, I have mistaking glass break, people knocking on the door and a lot of other sounds which cause us to be scared at night.Also, watching the ball games immerses you in the crow, you can hear the kid down 3 rows over 10 seats saying the stats of a player. Crazy.Here is my current layout:Mirage Onmisat v2 FS (2)Mirage Onmisat v2 CC (1)Mirage Onmisat v2 SAT (4)Mirage Onmisat S12 (1)Yamaha RX-V2700 receiver"
2,Didn't appreciate the presentation nor the approach used,"I didn't like to approach used in this book.The photos didn't impress me.I also found it hard many times to relate to the interpretation given by the photographer to his photos.The black&white; look and feel were also not appealing to me.Sure, it covers quite a lot of the ""standard approach"" to composition. But for me it was like attending a boring class where the only correct answer was the answer that the instructor gave...I was missing the *creativity* that is so attractive for me in other photography-books. I was also missing the feel of *fun*.If you want a fun book, loaded with creativity and full with AMAZING photos, then check out Bryan Peterson's books. He has one about composition too which is a lot more useful and a lot more helpful than this book was to me."
2,WOW!! Good book but TERRIBLE editing!,"This book has so many typos and mistakes!! It was very hard to read. If you could translated through all of that, it is interesting to see Longstreet's view on things. He is a very ""polite"" writer but you can kind of tell that he may not have been a fan of Stonewall Jackson.Again, though, the ""re-typing"" of this version was horrendous."
1,Misleading and disappointing,"This set is NOT by ""various artists"", rather all the cuts are by ""The Stage Door Players"". And they are NOT necessarily really all ""covers"" of the songs as performed in their well-known versions from the movies, but in some cases take quite a bit of (less talented) artistic license."
5,Moving and engrossing,"This is much more than a romance. It is the story of a woman trying to find herself while she shakes free of the past. But while readers will enjoy reading of Marigold O'Malley's attempts to find herself and the true meaning of home, they'll also be touched by the sense of ""forgiveness"" that permeates this well-told tale. Mari's new love, Andy, has a great deal in his past that requires a forgiving heart, at the same time he has to discover what it means to forgive others. His struggle is all the more poignant given his choice of work -- in a camp for troubled boys. This latter setting deepens an already-rich story as the backgrounds of the troubled boys are revealed. It's no wonder the author dedicated the book to those who work with such kids. The author is a master of description. You will feel you are breathing the humid summer air of the Ozarks and hearing the voices of her lively characters. I highly recommend this novel."
3,Put away the sharp objects,"... a very technically gifted filmmaker, and this movie is typical of the intensity his work is known for. To say that I enjoyed it wouldn't be quite right, because it's hard to say you enjoy something so reeking with cynicism, but it was nice to see a first-rate cast (and fun football cameos) go through their paces. I didn't see the film in the theater, so I don't know the entirety of what the ""Director's Cut"" added, but one omission is pretty obvious. It involves an extreme on-field injury that was most likely cut because of making the audience laugh at it's raw outrageousness. Keep an eye out for it."
2,There are better ways to kill a couple of hours!,"Given the calibre of the stars on this film and the credentials of the director, I must say that this film was a major letdown. The action sequences were more like a jazzed up MTV video than a serious attempt to capture a sporting sequence. And as to being a sports movie, its not quite that either. Lets just say that there are better ways of killing 2 hours that to sit through this movie for its outcome."
1,Over rated at one star,"One of the most boring, long winded pretend movie I have ever had the misfortune to see (what a waste,to think I actually bought it!!). Should rate no stars but that is not an option. It was more a documentary than a movie and an incredibly bad one at that. How could a classy cast make such a cruddy movie. The mind boggles.If you haven't seen it, don't waste your time (and it isn't a short movie) and this is from a real lover of sports movies, the good ones at least!"
4,Way too fast.,This is a fun game but way too fast and does not allow enough time to shoot everything. It does not take long for your hand to get tired and the lack of a auto reload is irritating. It would be nice to be able to move your character and choose your own path as in Quake. This is a difficult game due to its speed. I have not been able finish the training mode. The graphics are great but the game would be much more fun if there was some way to slow it down.
2,fast paced and fun,"you have to have a bionic hand to play this game its fast...even though the voice acting is annoying (robot sounding) and repeditive its fun to play not really for kids as its gory . if you can pick it up cheap somewhere ,get it its worth a play."
5,Forget botox and face lifts,"Save your money and your sanity. Do it the old fashioned way. My mother died at 85 and did not have a wrinkle on her face. She had this book, did the exercises and used Wrinkies and Frownies. This book is worth it's weight in gold!"
2,Heavy weight but not on bass,"I cannot even turn up the volume half way up on my ipod, these things distort the bass so bad, you have to play it @ 25% volume. Petey Pablo's ""freak a leek"" does not sound good at all. But, James Blunt's ""u'r beautiful"" sounds great, so u get my point. hip-hop & dance tracks will suck on these. also, i dont understand why they are a li'l on the heavier side, they fit very snugly so thats a plus for joggers. overall, 2 stars from me coz my portfolio of music is equally balanced between rock & rap among others and i am thinking of returning these."
3,How to do your best on tests,I thought this book was very good. Since i have read this book i've improved in my test taking skills and i also plan to do better on them in the future. I think this book can help people of all ages-young and old- read this book and you'll never fail a test agian.
5,Beautiful Noise,"This is a wonderful collection of Neil's love songs. I thought I knew every song ever recorded by Neil Diamond, but their are some gems on here that were new to me. Each song is sung with such depth and feeling. Listen to this to relax after a busy day and you will soon forget your troubles. I have been a fan of Neil Diamond's since I was a kid, and I always will be. Great service from Amazon too!"
5,Wallace,All Wallace books are good Buddhist books. This book is good but its not a starter book. However it is easy reading. The material is covered rather well.
1,Buyer beware,Look nice but this unit stay on all day all night. Obviously the sensor do not work well will try to have it replace assp
1,Poor value for money,"The document is 9 pages long. When I pay for any publication that's $1 per page I expect the contents to be of the first order. This document though, has 1 page of contents, 1 of justification for BIA, and 2 of information that's easily obtainable in 5 seconds using a search engine on the web (I.E. names of DR journals and links).So the meat of the topic is covered in 5 pages. These 5 pages are fairly high level, and give the sort of information that easily obtained from any specialist publication (the document even uses the Disaster Recovery Journal as a source).In summary this belongs as a article in a trade magazine, and overall is poor value for money. If I could I would ask for a refund."
5,"Read from above, pours nicely","It's about time someone design a liquid measuring cup that can be read from above, looking down into the cup, instead of trying to raise it to eye level without sloshing the liquid around. Brilliant! My other concern was that it pour well without making a mess, and it succeeds here as well. You can't pour too quickly, but as long as you don't overdo it, it pours with spilling or dribbling. I am very pleased. with my purchase."
4,"Huge capacity, great for making beverages or cooking sauces","This is a very handy tool. With 8 cups, it will hold a lot! It is useful for making tea or lemonade, though the only negative (and the reason I didn't give 5 stars) is that some of the pour spouts are rather dribbly and messy. It's also great for making pudding, gravy, or cheese sauces in the microwave, and you can serve them right from the measuring cup because of the spout. Very versatile and useful."
1,A real disappointment,"After hearing Tim Green over the years on NPR, I have been impressed by his wit and intelligence. I eagerly picked up this book after hearing him discuss it on Weekend Edition. I was frustrated by the simplistic dialogue and a major character flaw in the beginning that nagged me throughout the book...any man so passionate about clearing his son's name would certainly spend at least a few minutes of mourning before meeting people in bars to pursue leads!"
3,best out of the series,"This movie was ok. It is like the rest of the series (Winners and Sinners my lucky stars, and this one) they always want a girl, but the ending fight scene with sammo, jackie and Biao was cool. The pepsi fight was cool too, you have to see Sammo with the tennis rackets, but this movie is mostly talking not action. This movie is not worth 34.95, I got it for 9.99, lucky for me."
1,Horrid,"I once saw this movie seven years ago and really liked it. Hey, I was young and naive. I recently rented this movie to see it again. I was once again robbed of my money. Cameron's Closet is 90 minutes of pure boredom. The acting is horrible, the monster is laughable, the writing is unbelieveable, I could just go on and on about how terrible this movie is. Cameron is a young boy who has telekinetic powers. He then brings a demon to life through a statue his dad gave him. Then people begin to die. A detective and a psychiatrist begin to investigate. I can't begin to comprend why I liked this movie the first time I saw it. This is just one big laughfest from the start to the end."
4,Easy to follow!,"The book uses a really easy way to follow for beginners. I am really interested in learning Japanese but didnt know anything besides Arigato and Sayonara.I would recommend this book for anyone who is looking to learn Japanese on its own. The only reason Im giving it a 4 stars is because the audio only repeats words without its translation so unless you memorized them before listening to the CD, there's no way you understand what they are saying."
3,first bed time book,"This was my child's first bed-time book. Each page has very few words and simple illustrations. Compared to some of the other Thomas books out there, the illustrations in this book seem to accurately depict the characters - which is a plus. My child loved it and always let us know that she wanted it to be read several times (maybe she figured out she could stay up longer! ). She is now 20 months and it does not hold her interst as it did just a few months ago, but it is a great first book in every way!"
2,earbud not too good,"I bought two of these combos, mainly for the headset. Unfortunately only one works well. The other one produces a lot of static-like noise for people on the other end of the line. You won't know this until they tell you... Amazon replaced that one for me, yet, unfortunately, the replacement is just as bad. I am just going to keep one. The other two things look okay, though I haven't tried the charger yet (saw from one of the earlier reviews that it is no good).All in all, you can try your luck. It is good when it works..."
1,the 5 bucks special returns!,"""video killed..."" sounds like the 15 year old tracy merop singing in the song"
5,A return to order,"I had just about given up on New Order before I bought this album. I remember when I first heard them about 15 years ago, and they instantly became my favorite band. Their sound connected with me in new way that I had not felt before. But by the time they came out with Republic, I thought their sound had become very bland. They were going through the motions of making music, but it didn't have much substance.( No pun intended, really.)This album, though, speaks to me again. There is soul, love, and good drums and bass. Of course, Bernie's lyrics are obscure, but this is nothing new and it never mattered much before. I think the third track is one of their best ever. If you have stuck with New Order since Brotherhood or earlier, this album will entertain you."
1,gets worse with every listen,"This album includes some of the worst lyric writing in recent memory. Why does every other word have to rhyme? Melodies are missing any punch and coupled with this horrific lyrical mess, this album aint worth much."
3,Wet Sock Boys Rub Off On Sumner,"if you buy this CD, be sure and run it through some kind of karaoke device so you can strip the insipid vocals clean. production is amazing, Peter Hook is still godlike, but Sumner has definitely been spending too much time with the wet sock boys."
2,sad,"I had such high hopes for New Order's reunion cd. New Order and Joy Division have been my favorite bands for years, so i rushed out to this the moment it came out. Unfortunately, none of the things I liked about their previous albums are present.Barney's bitter lyrics and sensitive voice, hooky's droning bass, stephen morris' almost tribal, swelling drums... this album has none of it.The lyrics, first of all, are so bad and just plain stupid that i wince at almost every line. Hook's bass is not too bad, but ultimately doesn't achieve anything. No melody! He just kind of plucks along aimlessly. The drum tracks are uninventive and played out.This album is aggressively upbeat, so if you are into Electronic or other semi-vacuous synthesized brit pop it may be your cup of tea. If you liked New Order for the striking melodic melancholy of previous albums, give this one a complete miss."
2,What happened????,"I give them two stars because the CD says ""New Order"" on it. After being a big fan of these guys in the 80's, I was expecting something great. This wasn't it. These guys are washed up.This is nothing compared to ""Substance"" or ""Power corruption and Lies"". This sounds like a cheap immitation of New Order. I bought this, and got rid of it. There was only or two decent songs on it, and they are not that great. The meaning and passion is gone here. Truly a dissapointment. Don't waste your money and try to pretend to like this as I did. The days of New Order are over!!!"
4,"actually i rate it 4.5 great, fresh sound","this is my first new order album. i wouldn't have checked it out except that i had heard ""turn my way"" w/ billy corgan on it. i'm so glad i bought this. this is definetely the best album i have heard in a long time. it's amazing. the songs sound so fresh which is hard to come by. the lyrics are good as well. i would recommend this album to anybody who likes sad, melodic music. it's not overly sad though. just right"
4,Great Music...,How wonderful is it when a great band from the 80's and 90's can release an album in 2001 and still keep such a distinct sound. With this album New Order has modernized a bit but still keep their authenticity.'Crystal' and 'Rock the Shack' are my favorites. But every song is very good. I definately recommend this cd.
2,Over due and under par,"After such a long wait and hearing the single, Crystal, I was eager to get hold of this album. Having queued up for each new album since 'Unknown Pleasures' was released, Crystal suggested that, yet again, they'd come up trumps. It's a blisteringly good track with all the classic elements.Sadly, Get Ready isn't a particularly good album by anyone's standards. No major change in style (no change there!) but to me it doesn't really contain anything but one single and the rest are filler tracks. It hasn't grown on me any more in the months since I bought it and now gathers dust.I'd recommend spending the cost of this disc on a few beers and putting on Regret or Brotherhood or Lowlife instead. BTW the two stars are both for Crystal."
3,Lines and boxes,"Math nerds and philosophers will probably find this more exciting than I did. That said, it's not bad, but it certainly helped me fall asleep at night."
3,Didnt like,"This would be good for an intellectual but was beyond me. I grasped some of it, but got bored with it after awhile and didnt finish it."
4,Does the Job,"Simple product which does the job of elevating the CoSleeper up to our bed. Two problems, I wasn't able to find the color-matched legs through Amazon (only white). And once you start using the extensions it is VERY difficult to remove the extensions."

4,Songs That Speak To Your Heart.,"When I sit and listen to Jason Bennett's CD, I fall in love with folk music all over again. He has a wonderful fresh songwriting talent that talks to your heart. The beautiful simplicity of the guitar and cello are almost haunting. The song ""If It's True"" talks to my soul. Thanks, Jason, for breathing a bit of new life into folk music. I look forward to hearing more from you."
2,Way Too Much Fluff,"Ordered this book hoping for a ""bible"" on essential oils. Instead, well over half the book is filled with stock photographs that only occasionally pertain to the text. Even if I ignore the ridiculous photos the actual text reads like advertising--barely any actual information surrounded by clouds and clouds of unhelpful fluff. If you took out all the photos and fluff text there might be enough actual information here to fill a ten page pamphlet. I really wanted a book that gave me encyclopedic information of the oils and the plants they come from, had a great table of contents that let me look up recipes by symptom, and gave me helpful suggestions on ways to combine the oils so that they smelled good. This book does not live up to it's title, and it only gets two stars a) it was cheap and b)there are a few grains of information buried in it that may be helpful until I can find what I really want."
4,Great Information,This book was extremely helpful on offering the different uses of several esential oils and their properties. Recommended for soapmakers and toiletry manufacturers
2,not excellent,"this translation of Qur'an is not very easy to understand. I think it is OK, but I've read much better translations."
3,Entertaining and Fun,"Just what the doctor ordered, a good little movie to entertain you. If youhate snakes, then it becomes even better. I heard from so many peoplestating me facts and things that are not right with this movie....Chill out ...its only a movie, its fun and it does not preach. Enjoy"
2,Laughable and juvenile,"If you remember the online hype for ""the Blair Witch Project"" and the subsequent lousy movie that followed (although it still has many gullible people believing it was true...), then you'll not be disappointed to find out that the same kind of hype (for merely the title) online ensued for this film.The CGI snakes are about as believable as Saturday morning cartoons. The real snakes give one pause, but they are few and far between and quite understandably non-poisonous. The rubber snakes are plentiful as is the hokum.There is the requisite sex scene for such a film - this time to gain membership in the mile high club. There's a lousy script full of woefully pitiful cliche dialogue. There's the gory and gruesome but never are there really any scares nor any suspense.My 13 year old son announced that the film was ""totally lame"" when we left the theater.I couldn't put it better myself."
4,"MF snakes, MF plane, MF great!","This flick was good. Yes it had cheesy lines and of course the action was predictable but I had fun with it. It also appears the actors didn't take it or themselves too seriously just the same. It's not the best movie I've seen, but probably one of the most entertaining movies I've watched this year. Samuel L. Jackson played a role that really reminded me of ""Deep Blue See"" & Julianna Marguiles who's just plain hot. A couple of beers might probably help the plot but as long as you don't watch it expecting too much top shelf acting or a serious movie you'll enjoy it."
2,"Scary, Bloody, Predictable","A witness to a murder boards a plane from Honolulu to Los Angeles, protected by a federal agent. Little do they know that poisonous killer snakes have been carefully planted in the bowels of the plane, ready to come out at a specific time to kill the passengers and to eat away at the wiring of the plane.Samuel L Jackson, as the federal agent, plays his usual ""I'm cool and I'm tough no matter what"" typecast character, and he works hard at trying to save his client and as many passengers as he can.As it turns out, it's up to one of the passengers to land the plane safely. Think Airport 75 and Deep Blue Sea rolled into one, and you have Snakes on a Plane.It's predictable, it's bloody, it's wince inducing, but this movie will appeal to disaster flick aficionados and people who like films with snakes and blood and gore."
1,Oh gawd how awful,"That is two hours of my life I will never get back. I actually believe that I am truly dumber for having seen this movie. Cliche`, stereotypical, predictable, and utterly terrible.Oh Samuel, what happened to you?"
2,Snakes on a plane - LAME,"What can i say? Jackson can't act for one, this movie was fantastically LAME you'll laugh, you'll cry (you'll cry from laughing so hard) always beware a film that's advertised to death like this was its a sure tip-off . if you want to see snakes in a vessel your better off looking for a copy of Fer-De-Lance a 1974 TV movie (snakes in a sub) PURE TRIPE"
1,BOOOO....Hissssss,"I wish I could come up with even ONE reason to see this film...one incident, one unwitting mistake, one camera angle...anything...but I cannot. If you HAVE to see it for some reason, slither away fast and try to erase it from your memory as soon as you can."
3,A herpetologist's wet dream,"Federal agent Neville Flynn (Samuel Jackson) must battle a planeload of venomous snakes that have been released by a powerful crime figure in order to kill a witness (Nathan Phillips). This film has a certain amount of entertainment value, even though it feels like a calculated effort to manufacture a cult hit, complete with quotable tag line that pops up as a sample in one of the forgettable tunes on the soundtrack. Jackson, of course, is always watchable, and the film doesn't stand still long enough to get boring, so you may find it to be an acceptable rental if you don't have too much of a snake phobia."
1,Fire Samuel Jackson's agent,"The most predictable, stupid film I've seen in a long time. And by the way, there are no poisonous snakes in Hawaii. Pitiful."
1,Arguably one of the worst movies ever,"Thankfully, I saw this movie on cable and didn't pay for it. I love Samuel L Jackson and I'm always up for a bad ""horror"" flick. While this movie provided some laughs (mostly groans), it was just too awful for words. I should have known when I saw that Champ from ""Anchorman"" was in it that this movie was going to be more ridiculous than even the title led me to believe."
3,"Neat idea, falls a little short","I gave these 3 stars, the headphones are comfortable, but the case they go in is a little annoying. Yes the cords stay wound up and untangled but the act of getting them wound up is not smooth. I just end up opening the case winding the cords by hand around the center portion and closing the case. As for the quality of the headphones, I would say they are average, I have had much better, I got these just for the logo, and that is about all the offer."
3,seems OK,"This product seems ok, not sure if works or not, trying it now and was easy to use and all, but not sure if really worked, a little cheaper than others I have found, but who knows? Who knows, seemed OK."
5,Excellent Scholarship,Dr. Van Sertima delivers again. I highly recommend to all -- from the serious scholar to the simply curious.
5,"Ah, the Joys of Youth!","Like several others here, I was introduced to this music as a young high schooler in the late 50's and I loved playing it. So, here I am in my late 60's listening to it for the first time in years.The band is terrific and the arrangements just as I remember them. Grainger and Holst were the premier composers for the band and much more complex and subtle than Souza, though he was no slouch!Buy with confidence!"
5,"excellent, innovative interesting ideas","After reading this book, I wanted to pack my bags and head to London to study with Richard Rogers. His observations on the importance of balancing population, resources and the environment is right on. He identifies the need for compact cities, but seeks to reinvent the dense city model to be a cleaner, greener, more integrated place. Rogers pays specific attention to positive social changes that compact cities can make, and he addresses the importance of regionalism to acheiving sustainability goals. Also, he explains how proximity allows for creative reuse of resources and efficient building design. The book is unique; Rogers makes concrete suggestions and offers actual examples of ways to acheive sustainability."
5,future,"There's probably a great truth in the fact that the last 50 years of planning have enrich few and impoverished many.Zoning is simple, clear, fast and economically definable, but it isolates the people who are destined to live there, and enslaves them to the use of car.Overlapping and dense urbanism is historically a step back, is more work for planners, more difficult to understand for the laymen and developers and will cost more, but it will ultimately favor humane contact, regenerate sense of community, diminish the slavery of people on machine and last but not least reduce pollution.We have to reconsider the word coined by the Polish American Architect Lubicz of Nycz: Urbantecture.Urbanism & architecture are very delicate matters, intimately tided they create the frame for the world we live in.This is a great book for planner, politicians and people, because everybody today is oblige to look at cities as sustainable places where life can prosper only in respect of nature."
1,Very poor design,"This product has many design flaws. 1) Its USB connector style makes sense for a thin memory stick but, as a MP3 player, it is a memory brick. It was too large to fit the front USB connector on my Dell. It only fit in one of the rear USB connectors and then it covered over one of the others. 2) The manual warns you not to use earphones other than the ones supplied because they may have the wrong impedance which may damage the device. The last time I saw that warning was on early transistor power amplifiers when the first replaced tubes. 3) The manual also warns you to always run the ""safely remove removable devices"" dialog before removing the device from your computer. I forgot to do that because I do not have to do it for any of my other USB memory devices. In this case, it apparently trashed the flash memory beyond recovery."
5,Book Review,I have now read all of the Mossy Creek books. Enjoyed these very much. I have recommended these to friends and I hope that they enjoy them as much as I did. Amazon recommended one of them to me and that hooked me.
4,More of The Same Thing Isn't Always Bad,"In the case of Richard Foster, more is a very good thing. Once again Foster gives us a glimpse of spiritual disciplines through the lenses of the greatest Christian authors of history. This time he tackles the following subjects:. INWARD DISCIPLINES. meditation, prayer, fasting, study. OUTWARD DISCIPLINES. simplicity, solitude, submission, service. CORPORATE DISCIPLINES. confession, worship, guidance, celebrationIf you liked any of Foster's other books, you will like this one."
5,On the way,"Excellent compilation of Christian works including poems and letters by some of the ""brightest lights"" in the Christian tradition.We are using it for.a Women's Bible study and there is much anticipation building among the ladies...start date is Oct. 5. The format of the book will work out well for the 12 week semester group."
3,I was disappointed,I was hoping for more in depth meditations. Instead I got a guy making a strange sound (laughing) often because he is in front of an audience.Only in the last 5-15 minutes does he try to connect everything he's been saying. That's not enough time to grasp it.
1,waste of time,As a huge fan of The Firm this book was a disappointment. There are no thrills and no suspense. Spend your time/money elsewhere.
2,Argubly the worst ending ever commited to paper,"Deus ex machina...anti-climactic...a let-down...all of the above. Although I often critize Grisham for ending his novels too similarly (riding off into the sunset, never to practise law again...), anything would have been preferable to the way this book ends. To make matters worse, the story is actually halfway decent until the ending. Now you're probably thinking, ""Why James, surely you jest! It is preferable to have a decent book with a cruddy ending than a cruddy book through and through."" I would actually have preferred the book to have been lousy through and through, because as it was it generated just enough tension for me to actually care about the answer to the question the book revolves around. Instead, Grisham picks the worst possible character, the worst possible reason, and the worst possible motives. Look elsewhere...please. 3.5/10"
1,Better ways to spend your reading time . . .,"Enjoying the book hinges on your ability to suspend belief. The reader needs to believe that a law professor would not consider putting cash into bank safe deposit boxes (better to leave it in trash bags in a trunk!); and that his brother, who never demonstrated self-control in his life, would suddenly acquire incredible self-control even when he's drunk.Oh, and then you have to like weak characters and mediocre writing."
2,Same Old Cookies,"Let's see, I need a new cookie to make a lot of money. I will make the same batter ensuring that it is thin enough to drop from a spoon. Now to make everyone think that I have come up with a wonder new treat, I will use red sprinkles (Jimmes) from my unlimited collection of beautiful colored sugar beads.Was really looking forward to something different, but... Same Grisham plot, different cover, more money. Foolish me. But I'm sure I will buy the next one hoping for a different treat."
2,Unbelievable w/ unusual twist at end...The Un-Grisham,"""The Summons"" is probably the worst book John Grisham has written. Unfortunately, noone in the editing station asked themselves if certain parts of the book were actually believable. The main character seems to always be a sitting duck but still manages to escape harm or robbery everytime. Grisham also did something in this books that he hasn't done before: use a twist at the end to reveal the real perpetrator. This part makes sence but acts like a sore thumb when placed amonth the rest of his work. Let's hope he didn't actually write this one."
2,The Summons- A real disappointment,"I have enjoyed John Grisham's other legal thrillers, but found The Summons lacking. I feel it would have made an excellent short story, but was too predictable. The characters really had no depth. Does the publisher offer a money back guarantee? I spent a small fortune on the CD audio version."
3,Not his worst - not his best,"Oh boy, some reviewers do get up tight when Grisham doesn't quite perform for them! Personally, though The Summons was certainly not Grisham's best book, I would rather shell out some hard earned cash for this one than for A Painted House Skips Christmas in a Chamber! Those three were garbage compared to Grisham's other stuff.This one was just average... an average story written in an average way. Okay, admittedly, from about halfway through, it was fairly obvious whodunit. The only questions that remained were how Pop got the money in the first place, and why hewhodunit was doin' it. But even so, it was a fairly even-paced read that didn't use up too much brain power.Maybe Grisham isn't quite performing as he might, but even minor gods can have bad book days. If you've got enough money in your pocket to buy The Summons and a couple of other books - go for it! If you're a bit short and the rent's not paid, I'd suggest you look for something more certain."
3,Lackluster ending ruined it,"I enjoyed the first 3/4 of this book, but the ending was rather unfulfilling. The plot runs somewhat along the lines of ""A Simple Plan"" by Scott Smith, but with a somewhat different angle. The characters were relatively well developed, and the plot was relatively interesting in the first 2/3 or 3/4 of the book. But then it seemed that Grisham changed gears and decided to wrap it up quickly (perhaps to meet a deadline?). The ending, while plausible, was very unfulfilling, and quite a letdown, IMO."
1,Can't I give it zero stars?,"I usually like John Grisham's works- funny, complex characters, page-turner, etc. But this book was so anti-climactic and the characters never really seemed real or interesting. At the last page, I turned to the next page not realzing that the book was over. That's bad. It's not that I felt like putting it down, but after it was over, I was like ""ok"". Read this book if you want, but it's far from great- had this been a new author, it might have gotten two stars, as the author would have had promise, but for John Grisham, it's a total let-down, especially considering he hasn't written a legal thriller in a few years. And by the way, this really isn't a legal thriller either, so to let you know."
2,Just an average book.,It seems as though Grisham is trying too hard here. The plot isn't very complete and the ending very unsatisfying. It seems as though Grisham is good every other book and this years hit for him is Skipping Christmas.
2,Real Grisham Fans only,"I have read about everything John Grisham has written and this to me was disappointing. The premise was interesting and there were some suspenseful parts. The character development was probably the best part as you did feel that you knew someone just like the characters, especially the family and close friends. The conclusion was empty for me. Didn't feel like closure. If you like narrative around locations and characters or are a Grisham fan, it will not be an empty read but certainly didn't meet expectations."
2,"ephiany for forrest, empty woods for others","a halting beginning, shallow middle and absent of ending -- disappointing, hurried project from otherwise talented writer."
1,Best Seller? Based on reputation alone,"I am so tired of great books being ignored because people spend their time reading trash like this book. So he had a some great books in the past. Does that mean every book he writes will be a good book? Obviously not! This book was boring, unrealistic, and nothing like what I picture a Legal Thriller to be. The title, and the explaination of it's meaning, was really lame. I knew I was in for it after the first chapter. ...I am off mainstream! I will never buy another book by the established writers of the world again! There are too many great works out there to expore."
2,No real story here,"John Grisham is a gifted story teller and has proven it through his great works, like A Time To Kill and The Firm, but it seems as time passes by his stories have become weaker and predictable. Not once did I feel suspense or drama in The Summons. The characters were not developed to make me love them or hate them, I felt nothing for them. Just one simple plot, no real twists or turns, no subplots, just a dull straight forward plot. If you want a good Grisham book, I suggest you go back and read his first works and skip this one all together."
3,good book but predictable,this was good but i figured it out before the end...i won't give it away here but you will like it and won't be able to put it down to find out the ending.
3,Not Bad but not Great.,"I picked up ""The Summons"" and was not expecting much. So I was surprised to be turning the pages of this book with anticipation when I began reading. This book seemed to grab hold from the beginning ad not really let go until the last couple of chapters.The story line is interesting and I was happy to see that this book did not play out in a courtroom, like many of Grisham's works. I found only one flaw and I would guess it is a fairly major one, the ending was very predictable. The story line kept you guessing for about the first half of the book, but mid way through, you could predict the end very easily.I would say that this book fit the bill if you are looking for a fun, quick read that does not really require much thought to figure out. All in all I would say a so-so work by Grisham."
2,The party is apparently over,"I have read all of Grisham's books. I think The Firm is one of the best page turners ever. I generally enjoyed most of the others, but I think The Testament was so bad that somebody should have been prosecuted. I also found the Bretheren lacking.And, we come to The Summons. Slow, plodding, takes way too long to tell the story, and when you get to the end, alas there isn't much of a story. I think Grisham has lost it. I won't bite on the next one. The Summons for me was one of those books that made me angry that I had spent time reading it."
4,Good Rainy Afternoon Read,"My husband and I are both JG fans and have all his books. I enjoyed this one, despite the opinions of many of the reviewers who have posted. It was different and I found it quite humorous. We were iced in yesterday and it was a nice way to spend the afternoon. There are times when it's not my goal to have to fill my mind with ultra plotting and mind boggling suspense and this one just fit the bill and I thought the end, though predictable, was a fine ""touche"". So, read at your own risk. Obviously many of us did not enjoy it but then again, many did. I, for one, was not disappointed."
4,quick and entertaining read,"I picked this up as airplane reading for my next trip, but ended up reading it beforehand. I thought this was one of Grisham's better recent efforts. Although one reviewer here thought the ending was poor, I thought it was well done and wrapped up nicely, though it was perhaps a bit abrupt. (Nowhere near as abrupt as, say, Neal Stephenson's endings, however.) If you liked The Partner (probably my favorite Grisham), you'll probably like this one,"
2,Grisham - The Summons,"The Summons is not an awful book but it has very few redeeming qualities. The story moves slowly - and that would be okay if it weren't for the poorly developed characters and complete lack of suspense - and I found myself expecting, at some point, something jarring to happen, for the plot to really kick in. And it never did. Even going into the final 100 pages, I hoped that something was going to happen to redeem the time I'd invested in the first 300 pages. There was no payoff. And the ending? Don't get me started. Its as if Grisham, like me, had just had enough and stopped working.I've no doubt that there are better Grisham novels out there. I just sincerely wish I hadn't wasted my time with this one."
1,Very disappointed,"I have read almost all of Grisham's books and really enjoyed them. The Summons was so slow and never really got started.I stayed with it thinking it had to get better. It didn't.The characters were weak and the plot didn't have much to offer.I ended up skipping parts because they were so boring. As I turned the last page, all I could think was what a waste of time."
2,A Waste of Time,"You know the plot. You know the characters.This is simply a poorly constructed story of sibling rivalry, with lightweight characters, and shallow plot development.The ending wasn't a disappointment; it wasn't anything but predictable and inconclusive.I am a Grisham fan, however, if this had been the first book of his that I had read, I wouldn't bother again."
3,Not the Best Grisham,Not the best Grisham book. The storyline is o.k. but in my mind I was always a page or two ahead. Usually Grisham can keep you in suspense until the very end.His courtroom books are his best. I hope he returns to it for his next installment.
4,Not my favorite Grisham,"Though I enjoyed this book, I didn't find it nearly as intriguing as some of his earlier novels. The ending was fairly predictable, and the pace of the novel seemed fairly slow.Despite that, I found the story to be origional and interesting. It's the story of a man that is summoned home by his ill father. Upon his arrival, he finds his father deceased, and a boat load of money stashed away in a cabinent. He hides the money, and immediately, someone starts to tail him. He's chasing the origion of the money, and someone is chasing him..."
1,What the ???,"One of the worst reads ever. What was Grisham thinking, or maybe he wasn't, and just needed another check. Waste of time and money."
3,"Good, but not his best","I love John Grisham...I've read all of his ""law"" books & found them all wonderful in their own fascinating way. I got The Summons as part of my Valentine's (not real romantic, but I like books) & finished it that weekend. I felt that I had to sugarcoat my reaction of the book to my boyfriend, so he'd think I loved it. It wasn't terrible, but certainly not the best. It started out really interesting & I kept reading & couldn't put it down. However, the ending disappointed me greatly. I always thought he had pretty good endings, my fav being The Partner. This one reminded me of when I'd write papers in high school & was tired of writing, so I'd just rush the ending & end it. To me, that's all this was...a rushed, bad ending. I just kind of sat & stared at it & thought, ""That can't be it."" Unfortunately, it was. I was just upset because I was so excited about this book coming out & then the ending just really let me down."
2,"Grisham again and again, the same old!","no more for me! I have read them all. Very slow. Maybe just the fact that I have read too many, but his books seem to go to ""best seller"" status before the bookstores get them. Perhaps because they publish enough numbers from the ""get go"" to make it a best seller so you buy it. I have enjoyed a lot of his earlier books but the plots get thinner and thinner."
5,Oustanding novel!!!,"This book was a quick read, about one day for anyone whom is an avid reader. This book is as great as all his others. ..Gets you into the life of the characters until, you, yourself feel like one of them. This is defintely a must read for anyone who enjoys suspense or law novels."
4,"One of his ""different"" stories and yet more lawyer junk","Different isn't always good with Grisham but here it is. Sure, it's more lawyer junk but isn't that why we read him?You really feel the story's lead character as he searches in this yarn and Grisham takes that character - and us - to a strange place to finish but that's just fine.Don't expect a bombshell ending, the story doesn't need one. Just expect a good story."
3,Typical JG Legal Thriller,I love all JG books. This one is typical of his legal thrillers. Definatley worth reading.
1,Nowhere (and back) (5 times),"This was my first Grisham novel, and I can't say I'm too impressed. In fact, I'm a bit blown away by this author's popularity. The characters are 1/2 dimensional at most. Other than that it's the same themes repeated ad nauseum - Ray moving money from place to place, a rattling door or broken window, sleep deprivation and a bit of boozing, and the occasional suspicious character, all of which were too obviously red herrings. As a result the ending was far too obvious - for me it had boiled down to whether it was Rex or the brother.The most engrossing part was his tour of a casino security center. I think that says it all."
2,"Slow moving, and uninvolving","The novel takes a look at the way money corrupts, and changes people. Ordinary men will cheat, steal, lie and turn violent at the prospect of a large sum of cash.Summoned by his dying father, Ray Atlee returns to his childhood home one last time. When he arrives, he finds Judge Atlee dead on his sofa, and three million dollars in cash in a cabinet behind him. Ray is plagued by a myriad of questions: where did the money come from? Who else knows about it? Would anyone be willing to kill for it?I love legal thrillers, so this was a nice venture back to a long forgotten comfort genre. Grisham's writing is as beautifully descriptive as I remember. Unfortunately, the story moved at a crawling pace, and failed to capture my attention. I couldn't bring myself to become interested in any of the characters, and the ending was a bitter disappointment to say the least."
3,good stuff,"My first Grisham novel. I can see why he sells a lot of books, he ropes you in right from the start with a mysterious death, a creepy old southern mansion, and before you know it you've turned 400 pages. I found this book easy to follow though I did feel that the story bogged down a few times in the middle, but good reading across the board. Solid enough to have me looking for another Grisham novel to knock off."
1,ZZZZ...,"What a disappointment! I looked forward eagerly to Grisham's latest legal thriller, but he really let me down this time. Not only did I have a difficult time staying awake while trying to read this book, but I didn't care about any of the characters. Ray Atlee, the protagonist, is uninteresting and unlikeable. Last night I put it down with about 30 pages to go, and I'll have to force myself to finish. If you must read it for yourself, get it from the library and don't waste your money."
3,Just not credible,"I have a soft spot for Grisham, but this story is just too prepsterous even for him. The plot lacks complexity and depth and, as usual, the characters are about an inch deep. It might have been better as a short story."
3,What happened?,"The only reason I didn't give this less than three stars was because I did manage to get through the whole book. Although, I think this might have been more because it was short than that it held my interest. It felt as if John had a book due to his publisher so he just threw this one together overnight. I am an avid John Grishman fan & have all his books but this one was a major bust!"
3,"Light Entertainment, About What Your Might Expect","Unlike the majority of the reviewers, it would seem, I have always expected light entertainment from Grisham, not Nobel Prize literature. Keeping those expectations in mind, I thought ""The Summons"" was a relatively engaging novel, with and interesting premise and a enough suspense to keep interest. Get it on sale, wait for the paperback, borrow if from a friend or at the library and spend a few hours with this modest mystery."
1,grisham was in a hurry,"the summons was the worst Grisham book. it seems like he had to fulfill some obligatin to his publisher and hastily wrote this meaningless, forgetful book. the story is weak. and the ending is obvious. i used to trust the 'best selling list' but after seeing that 'the summons' made number one, i will from now on draw my own opinion on what is considered a good book."
1,Diane who?,If she is an author and gives The Summons 5 stars it's no wonder I have never heard of her. I'll be sure never to read her books.
2,Disappointing,"Like previous reviewers, I found the story to be very disappointing. It had great potential, but never quite got there. I found myself wanting to finish it, only because I had already invested so much time into it. I was really hoping that the story would pick up."
1,Sloppy writing,"John Grisham grew up in the south and was educated at various schools in Mississippi. The father of the main character in this book, Judge Atlee, has a painting of Nathan Bedford Forrest in his study. One can only assume that Judge Atlee being from Mississippi and having such a picture would view the civil war from the Southern perspective. Most of the battles of the civil war have two names, the Northern name and the Southern name. When referring to these battles Grisham has the judge using the Northern names. That is just plain sloppy. No southerner would say Antietam or Bull Run, those were the battles of Sharpsburg and Manassas respectively. And that little detail is only the beginning the problems with this book."
4,As good as The Firm,"I thought this was a good as The Firm, it kept me hooked from the beginning, it was a bit predictable but if you read much of this type of book you get good at figuring out who dun-it.After his last two I am glad to see he is back to the lawyer stuff, loved The Brethren."
3,Was Elmore Leonard a ghost writer?,"This is my first review but couldn't resist. I was really looking forward to this book with the setting the same as ""A Time To Kill"" but alas Grishom is tapering off to almost nothing these days. Cute story. Read it in two evenings..."
2,Ever Hear of A Swiss Bank Account???,"That is as much as I am going to give away as far as this book goes. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen. Nothing ever did. Wait, someone threw a brick through a window. How thrilling. Huge disappointment, although very well written. The storyline had a lot of potential, but this seemed more like a first draft than a published novel."
2,The story lost steam!,"I didn't like this book much. It had a lot of potential (like The Testament), starts off with a bang (like The Testament) but loses steam about half way through and you just can't wait to get to the end so that you can at least say that you finished the book! It got very boring after a while, Grisham unsuccessfully tries to build suspense around totally uninteresting characters (The most interesting character, Judge Atlee, dies in the beginning of the book). Grisham can do much better than this. Because his books are usually so good, I haven't given up on him yet and will await the next book. I gave this one two stars simply because it kept me going until about the middle of the book."
2,Disappointment,"John Grisham really lets us down on this book. The plot has possibilities, but he fails to develop it to its potential. After The Testament and The Street Lawyer I thought Grisham would explore in more depth the moral dilemma confronted. But instead the energy went into finding the source of the money and looking for ways to hide it. The greatest curiosity about the book, however, is why Grisham misrepresents estate taxes as he does. Even when considering the modest estate of the father without the hidden cash Grisham leads his readers to believe half would be eaten up in estate taxes. Surely as an attorney he knows the first $1m of the estate is tax free. I had to wonder if he was pushing a political agenda in this book."
3,Ready for another Grisham lite?,"The Summons was not a terrible read but it wasn't a riveting one either. I didn't care much for the protagonist, a professor who couldn't make up his mind for three hundred pages about whether to keep found money or not. The characters could have been more fully developed, some relationships expounded on.(i.e. his former wife.)I guessed the ending about mid way through,hoping I was wrong. But I was right and it was disappointing. I'm waiting for the return of ""The Firm"" John Grisham."
3,SLOW,"I am a fan of Grisham's first 3 novels, and haven't had the desire to read anything of his since. I should have stuck with that. The Summons was tedious and boring. I gave it three stars mainly because although I had my suspicions about the conclusion, it was tastefully done and somewhat suprising. Otherwise, this novel was not worth reading. It lacked depth and failed to hold my interest for long stretches of time. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,Superb reading by Michael Beck,"Kudos to Michael Beck for making something out of this medicore book. Were it not for his superb reading, I would have given this book 1 star. I'm a huge Grisham fan, but I have to agree with most of the other reviewers....this book stunk. It's almost as if someone else wrote it. There was none of his trademark ""gripping suspense"", the story didn't flow very well, and the ending was just terrible (too abrupt, too many loose ends)."
3,"Good Start, Anti-Climactic Ending","Grisham's legal novels have been trending toward unsatisfactory endings. That is the case with ""The Summons."" It starts out with great characters, atmosphere and potential drama. However, the ending is hollow. While still a big fan, I'm starting to wonder if Grisham's legal thrillers need more time in the oven."
1,WEAK WEAK WEAK . . . and did I say WEAK,"OK, so the story moves along and for awhile I was pretty engrossed. Then I started to get bored. Then I started to get frustrated. We are led to believe that Ray Atlee, an Antitrust professor at one of the most prestigious law schools in the country, can't figure out how to safely hide some cash? Give me a break. The main character's idiocy alone made me want to throw the book through a window. Another small point, John: How can you assume that your readers are so stupid that they don't understand the basics of estate taxes? One of the early premises of the story is that Ray wants to hide $90,000 from the govt. so that he wouldn't have to pay 50% in estate taxes . . . and his attorney agrees with Ray's concerns. Hello, anyone with the intellectual capacity to read your books knows that there are no estate taxes on estates valued under a certain ceiling (I believe $700,000 these days). At least get the law right if you are going to print this drivel of a story."
3,Excellent Reading,"I really enjoyed this book, probably more because of the reading than the story itself. Story was much better than The Painted House but not as good as Grisham's earlier works. If you're a Grisham fan you will probably enjoy."
1,why is this book even on the bestseller's list?,"only john grisham can take advantage of his previous reputation as the best lawyer-thriller writer.....this one is SOOO BAD...I would be ashamed to even want to publish this...let's imagine for one second that some unknown writer would be the author, nobody would ever talk about this book.as a fervent reader (living now in spain, and therefor not having access to the latest, unless via amazon.com) I feel that my investment (book + forwarding costs) were not at all worth my trouble.... what a shame, no plot, no intrigue, no nothing, no intelligence, simplistic phrases....it might take me a while before I read grisham again"
1,The worst book ever written,I can't believe this book got published. This boring story is about two brothers fighting over money after their father dies. Don't waste your time or money.
2,Bad ending,The first 100 pgs got my attention and my curiosity booming. The next 241 pgs did nothing to alleviate that. The book's main question went unanswered. Definitely one of Grisham's weaker books. This warrants a 5 out of 10.
2,Don't Summons this book.,"I think Mr Grisham spent to much time writing Skipping Christmas, he forgot this book. Like the other readers, I didn't care what happen to the lead character Ray. The story line was dull from start to finish. I hope he and other authors stop rushing to put out books that don't add up to much."
2,Dissapointing....,"Instead of repeating the comments of the other reviewers, I'll simply keep it short and to the point.At the end of the book, I was left thinking...""that's it??? I could have written a much better ending myself""!Very unlike most Grisham novels. Don't waste your time."
3,Not what I thought,"I really thought this book was going to be good. Then, it became a cat and mouse story with that money for several chapters. There was no story here. I wished I hadn't wasted my time reading this."
1,Not as good as the critics claim!!,I have always loved his books but all the hype didn't match this novel at all. Very slow reading leading up to a good ending (believe it or not). I was very disappointed in this novel and would not recommend to fans of Grisham because they will be very disappointed.
1,Dumb!,Anyone calling this drivel a pleasent read should have never read anything decent in his life so that he is short of comparing. JG is not a good author; he is so mechanic-but his thrillers are occassionally good for passing time- but this is an insult to readers and the publishing industry at all. Skip it!
2,Grisham needs a vacation,"I think John needed a little extra cash when he wrote this one. Slow moving, predictable, and generally a long long bore. Gee John, has fame done you in?"
1,Misleading,"John Grisham is my favorite author and I rush to read any of his books. I enjoy 'law and order' books and his fill the bill. I expected that from this book but it was not to be. First of all, I found the title of the book to be misleading. It is not a summons to appear in court, which I thought, but rather a summons from a dying father to his sons. The next misleading thing was the cover of the book. It shows what looks like the ceiling of a court. Why was that put on the cover of this book which only briefly entered a court? The story was not up to the Grisham standard and lastly, the ending was very unsatisfying and confusing. All in all this is the worst book that Mr. Grisham has written, not worthy of even the one star I gave it."
3,Well..........,"I read The Summons in one sitting, in an afternoon. It held my attention and was a thoroughly ""easy-read."" My disappointment in the book came in the fact that it didn't evoke a strong visceral emotion from me such that books like The Chamber and Walls did. I even liked The Bretheren more because, even though it didn't evoke the strong emotion, the plot was very creative. I'd recommend The Summons but would rather see Grisham return to the prison."
3,Nice Twist but I wanted more,Great book to read flowed nicely the pages melted away with the hopes of a big confirtation between the lead character and some hired lawyer scum but all you get is betrayal between two brother torn apart because of alittle money.
3,Just OK....,"This book started a little slowly (took me many weeks to get through the first 200 pages)...but then things quickly picked up (similar to ""The Firm""). For a Grisham fan, it is a good read. If you are not into Grisham already, pick something else first."
3,Not his best but worth the read,"I'm an avid reader of Grisham works, and looked forward to a new story. This one is not as intense of his earlier legal works, but was good. I guess I was disappointed that after waiting such a while for it that it did not keep me on the edge of my seat as the earlier books had."
3,"Better than most reads, but below average for Grisham","The Summons, by most standards, is a well written book with a interesting plot line. My disappointment can only come from my high expectations from Grisham. I feel the narrative of the book is strong, though it is lacking some of his usual action. The ending was a surprise but not as thoroughly enjoying as I hoped."
5,Great Gift,I bought this movie for my dad for Christmas he loved it!!! I think he has watched it at least 20 times!!!
4,Iron Will,Great movie.....We watch it again every year or so and always enjoy it. Excellent family entertainment.
4,Two Great Stars,Stockard Channing and Julia Stiles are great together and theydo an excellent job in this film. It keeps you glued to thescreen. This is one of my favorites.
1,Worst CD Ever,A local band that is just terrible. Needless to say it is bad. Some bands can at least crank one good song out but this is a prime example of music that is just plain wrong. Rent if you can but do not under any circumstances buy.
4,if its your stile,"A very diablo like game. Although i enjoy the game, friends dont like it. I guess you have to llike the style of gameplay."
2,"Boring, in a nutshell","It is rare that I get a computer game, and don't bother to complete it, even if I do it just to say I did.Prince of Qin is one I gave up on.The game lacks direction at times. I got to a certain point, and I had zero idea where to go, even with reloading an older saved game and trying again, to make sure I didn't miss some key dialogue.Given that I felt the game would tell you to ""accomplish A, obtain B,"" but never tell you where B might be found, or even an inkling as to where A could be begun at, I quit.This game was too much money to be this disappointing."
1,scammed again,"You think I would have learned the first time. That was after I ordered Tolle's ""second"" book ""Practicing the Power of Now"", only to find out on opening it that it consisted of nothing but excerpts from the original "" Power of Now"". Now after ordering this tape set, I discover that it was previously released as ""Companion to Power of Now Vol. 1"" Nowhere in the write ups does it mention this and it is only written on the front of the package in small black letters against a dark green backround. And guess what, I already have the tape set, ""The Companion to the Power of Now"" and so I am out twenty something dollars. To top it off, [Amazon.com] still sells ""The Companion...Vol. One"" and for more money, than this tape - its' twin. All I can say is shame on Sounds True and Tolle. Awareness is the key, Tolle tells us and nowhere is that more necessary than in buying his products,"
1,Why is there a need for Tolle to continually say more,"Having read some of the reviews and ideas I am afraid I have to agree about the way Tolle is marketing himself. He says that on enlightenment 80 % of his thought processes disappeared. He is a lovely and simple and inspiring guy and I have sent copies of his book to many people, and the CD Even the Sun will Die, but I would love to know why he feels this need to keep saying the same thing over and over and use his enlightenment like so many others to make a buck or two.Is there no other way to be....do we have to earn a living by marketing our spiritual awareness...how many CD's did Gandhi publish....? Will we have Tolle key rings next with NOW written on them?Please Tolle take this to heart...you are a lovely lovely man with a wonderful and simple message....do you do this for the love or the money?"
2,Awkward and unpleasant,"I was very disappointed with both the CD and the book. For one, the Chinese songs on the CD are English songs that have been awkwardly translated into Chinese - making for numerous, numerous instances of rushed lines and syllables, as well as contracted or dropped syllables/words. Additionally, they're not exact translations, either - the last line of ""Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes"" (which, in English, is traditionally ""Head, shoulders, knees and toes!"") becomes, in Chinese, ""Eyes, ears, mouth, nose, clap hands!""I also found the vocals to be horrendous. The English vocals are fairly standard kid's music fare - annoyingly cutesy/sweet/""dreamy"". The Chinese vocals are, for the most part, a screechy mess.The only reason I gave this item 2 stars is because my son, despite what I think, likes the CD. And, to be fair, the spoken Chinese sections aren't that bad - plus, it's one of the few widely available Chinese language learning products for children."
1,Book was for class,"A quick read but only useful if professor is going to make students refer to the book throughout the semester. Book was waste of money, not because I couldn't comprehend what was in the book, but because professor based 95% of class on his lecture notes. Book served its purpose: A- for class."
1,terribly unfunny movie,"What are these other reviewers thinking??!! I bought this because so many of them said it was funny, yet there was not one laugh to be had in the whole movie. The acting is just awful, and Tara, Lea, and Norm had glorified 2 minutes each and were just along for a paycheck. A truly bad movie. One of the worst and unfunniest movies I have ever seen. If I could give 0 stars, I would have. They just do not make good teen comedies anymore. Any of the American Pie movies were 10,000 times funnier and better written and acted."
3,;0),Not bad and twist at the end but the make up could have been wayyyyyyyyyyyy better. Two couples went out sailing something happens and they come across a village and all is not what it seems in the village.
3,Now That's a Horror Movie!,Fantastic H.P. Lovecraft adaptation! I enjoyed it immensely. Not for the squeamish though.
1,WHY..,"Why, I ask. Why was this move even made? Now I am a movie fan of all genre's, but ""Dagon"" was by far the worst movie I have even seen! I did by this move after I watched it, for one reason. No movie collection is complete unless you have the worst ever made! But non the less, I wouldn't even give it a star but I had to choose a 1"
3,"The best HPL adaptation, though that's not saying much","Horror pioneer and genius H.P. Lovecraft has had an even shakier ride than Stephen King when it comes to screen adaptations. ""Dagon"", a blending of the stories ""Dagon"" and ""The Shadow over Innsmouth"" was clearly made by fans of Lovecrafts work, and is easily the best film ever adapted from it. Those unfamiliar with Lovecraft won't enjoy it as much, as you'll probably miss most of the references. I definitely advise watching the film with subtitles on, as some of the actors are not native English speakers and their lines can be very hard to understand.Overall this is a solid ""B"" horror movie, with not too much gore and some genuine frights."
