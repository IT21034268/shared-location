2,Not very good,"I bought this based on the 5 star reviews. My children (ages 4 and 2) have been learning sign language for 2 years now, and they were very un-impressed with this DVD. The characters sign too fast for educational purpose, and to be very honest, from a parents perspective, it's a super cheesy movie for a big price of $20 per video. The themes don't make sense, I was so disappointed!"
5,Delightful!,"This a fun and heartwarming book. As one of my favorite authors, she is always good at including every character in her plot, which makes it much more fun! The relationship between all of the characters is so rich and entertaining that it makes it hard to put this book down! With the dainty sense of humor and the chivalrous back ground, I would say this book is highly recommended!"
2,Limited Creativity,"I was disappointed. I guess I had higher expectations for this book because I flipped through it @ a bookstore and thought it had potential. And while, yes, the instructions are clear and detailed, I thought that it would have a lot more ideas but it basically just repeated the same boring accordion-styled book over and over."
5,Fantastic....!,"This book is absolutely excellent, it has alot of wonderful and helpful information,I am very glad I brought this book, I'm almost ready to fire my wedding coordinator."
5,Real information without silliness and confusion!,"This is a great book for parents and kids to read together and for kids to reread to answer questions on their own. I just bought this for my 8-year-old and me to read together. The short chapters, great illustrations and straightforward language with just enough humor to start conversations makes this book a must have for any parent! My son was able to ask questions and share his feelings and skip the sections he was not ready to hear about.The ""bird and bee"" comic book style and dialogue help kids to know that their curiosity or lack thereof is perfectly normal. The book's explanation of human biology before sex and family chapters leads readers through a natural progression of essential and age-appropriate information.I am looking forward to re-reading this book with my son and to getting the authors' puberty and sexuality book.I read ""Where did I come from?"" when I was a kid and I would recommend this as an alternative hands down!"
2,A little too much detail for a 10 year old,"I bought this book along with ""It's a Girl Thing"" (which is perfect for her age now). I didn't think this book was appropriate for my daughter who is almost 11 -- My husband and I read the book together and agreed that it will have to wait until she gets her period and/or is almost 12. It is a good book though, but not for now! It gets a little too detailed about sex, so we thought that a book that lightly touched upon the subject (""It's a Girl Thing"") was perfect for her age now."
4,This Book Has The Answers They Want!!,"I bought this book and a book by the same author called ""It's Not The Stork!"". Personally I think they need to be presented together because ""It's Not The Stork"" explains how boys & girls bodies work while ""It's So Amazing!"" focuses more on reproduction.My 9 year-old had very specific questions and this book helped me answer those in a mater of fact manner and made her feel comfortable hearing the answers.Good Luck!!!"
5,Perfect Presentation and Information for My 8 yo,"I could not be happier with the way this book is laid out and the information that is communicated within. My child has been asking a lot of questions lately and wanted answers! The comic strip format coupled with the diagrams and scientific explanations achieves just the right balance. I appreciate the way the book touches on sensitive matters but does not take a moral point of view, so I can complement it with our own faith teachings. Given the diversity in our own family with adoption, artificial insemination, etc., I appreciate that these topics are covered as well in a thoughtful manner. Highly recommended."
5,You won't be able to live without this planner,This wedding planner was terrific. I carried it to all my appointments and during the months that I made purchases for the ceremony and the reception. It is very useful and has many great ideas. It is also a great way to record all the memories that are involved in planning your wedding.
5,Amazing Wedding Planner!!,"My MOH and soon to be sister-in-law gave me this book. I am extremely organized and love lists. I absolutely love this book. It has so much information and good ideas including engagement party, bridesmaid luncheon, rehearsal dinner, ceremony, reception, and honeymoon.This is the best wedding book ever, and I cant wait until my perfect wedding! Its so great to do everything myself without the help of a wedding planner.I added tabs to my notebook to find things easier and some clear plastic covers to add in a few important details. This book will be great when I help other family and friends plan their wedding. They can look back at what I spent on certain items, etc.The only negative I have is that the notebook is a little flimsy. I am babying it though, so hopefully it doesnt get messed up. But, even if the notebook falls apart, the contents can easily be removed and new content added too!I would definetely recommend this book!"
2,Not enough space for additions,"I thought spiral bound meant I could add my own pages. That was important to me since I'm doing my guest list online, etc. But that's not true, and the pockets are very small, you couldn't add more than a few things. I'm going to return it and look for a three-ring binder style, or perhaps just buy a three-ring binder where I can add my own clippings."
4,Better than beware of scorpions,This is a better cd than beware of the scorpions. I think more time was put into it. It's pretty heavy throughout with the best song being Illusion but all of them are pretty good.
3,Mcauley-ie,"I've loved Schenker since ""virgin killers"", scorps, on through UFO, and espicially MSG. I have to say, ever since Mcauley-Schenker, I've been somewhat disapointed when it come's to any album he's put out with vocals in it. He's put out some kickin instramentals but comon Mikie, let's grab back hold of your root's. Go find out whats on Gary Barden's agenda and kick our a--'s once again. I will still be a lifelong fan, and fellow musician always."
3,"Not bad at all, but could have used more seasoning","Considering the revolutions in Schenker's private life over the past few years, it would have stood to reason that this album would be a total disaster. However, there are plenty of Schenker's patented rhythm figures, and singer Chris Logan adds some excellent melodies. The only problem with this outing is that it sounds as if it was recorded to quickly. The guitars never hit the razor sharp highs of Schenker's best work. There are some tricky riffs and a continued exploration of exotic harmonies as first seen on the Covenant album. Jeff Watson contributes some fine guitar solos, but it's not clear why. Schenker's own solos are pretty good here too, but there's nothing that completely rips it up like ""Hello Angel"" or ""Back To Life."" It's nice to see that he's still doing new music, though."
2,Michael's lost his TradeMark? Thanks to Mr. Varney,"I didn't expect that Michael's last release would be so nasty. Though after absolutely plain BAOS I should have expected it. Aranchophobiac is even worse and plainer - no trademark of Schenker, only MSG sign at the top points that this is Schenker's release. But this album could have been done by anyone.There something interesting in Evermore, Aranchophobiac and a bit in It's Over Now, but other songs I cannot even rememeber though I've tried listening to this album 5 times.I cannot say it is bad, it is rather midquality, though I see no inspiration in this release, just plain hardrock. Just tasteless hardrock. But Schenker as my idol #1 should sound better, at least like he did at his first cooperation with Mr. Varney - Unforgiven. Other releases - be it UFO or MSG - went worse and worse.OK, I'll try listening this release one more time, though I do not believe in success. Hope that the next release will show Flying V in its best."
1,Where are you Michael?,"How bad can it get? I love Michael Schenker from UFO, MSG, and McCauley Schenker. When ""Walk on Water"" came out, I thought hard rock was alive and well again. Then, the next UFO album came out.....and sucked. Michael is a busy guy, and puts out alot of material, which is admirable, but the quantity goes up and the quality goes down.He has spread himself too thin, putting out mostly garbage since ""W.O.W."".I should have known by the stupid album cover how bad ""Arachnaphobiac"" would be, but I bought it anyway. Maybe I'm living in the past, but I'm 40 years old, and still like hard rock/heavy metal as much as I always have.I'm scared to pay good money for a new cd these days!!!I hate to say it, but avoid this one unless you have a friend who'll let you borrow it"
3,Good Information but the Author Can be annoying,"A good, concise reference guide however, I would have liked to see more specific over 35 issues. The author has a compassionate, sensitive, emotional approach often lacking in other books on this topic, however her self-congratulatory, look at me, do as I say not as I do, alpha female overachiever stylings get tiring. We get it Dr. Shanahan youre an accomplished physician who graduated from top schools, worked obsessively throughout your pregnancy etc etc--- but lets get back to the medicine thats why I bought the book; for guidance not to read the authors C.V."
3,Not the best book to start with,"Fox's book demonstrates breadth, but lacks depth. It is perfect for people who have been bouncing around the job market for a few years; it is dangerous for those just starting out. This book's lack of depth leaves entry-level workers very ""raw"" for hiring managers.I began using Fox's guidelines in this book religiously 6 months ago. I still had no call-backs after about one month into my job search. After three months, I was a tired (he recommends waking up at 5:30 AM) and defeated Social Scientist with a Masters degree and background in advanced Statistical methods. Only after I retired this book to a shelf and picked up a more conventional approach did the job interviews start pouring in.Don't waste your money if you're fresh out of school. Use caution otherwise.I recommend HOW TO INTERVIEW LIKE A TOP MBA by Shel Leanne."
2,"Great reference book, crappy design book","Imagine buying a simple electronic device, bringing it home, and then discovering a 600-page step-by-step directional manual for setting it up. This is how the visual quickstart guide explains designing a web site. This book has a full segment on how to use a pen tool. We all know how to use the pen tool- a monkey can use the pen tool. If you can coherently read a scientific manual- have at it, if you're like me, and you need to put it in practice and have a sample project to work on (I realize I have been spoiled by the Classroom In a Book series), then you cannot use this book. All I wanted to do was to expand my graphics ability, not become a master Flash guru."
4,Great starter but a little thin,This VQS book gives a great high-level of a broad spectrum of functionality of Flash but does not go into much detail. Good starter book.
5,Linteater Dryer Vent review,"This item cleaned as it was advertsied. I thought it to be expensive, but it is well-built, and of thougthful, simple design. I paid $45 (incl. an additonal set of threaded rods and shipping. I bought this instead of the hand-turning type as I had a long run (over 24') and believed a drill to be more efficient. Instructions should be read as there are some caveats to follow. This dryer vent had not been cleaned since the house was built in 1990. I removed tightly compressed lint and hair the equivilant of a grocery bag in volume. I was shocked at how much of that stuff came out. I was skeptical as the air volume from the exterior vent opening did not increase after cleaning. However, dryer times reduced from two hours to 30 minutes. That told me a definite improvement had taken place. The savings in electricty and shortened times on the dryer heating element will pay for the price of this kit in one month."
3,Good but limited.,"Not flexible enough to go through all the right angles. We had to take the pipes down to be cleaned, but it did do a good job of cleaning them out. Then we put the pipes back up. However, the dryer is working like new again. There wasn't a lot of build-up either, which underscores the importance of keeping the lines clean. A load of whites went from 90 minutes to 60 minutes post cleaning, the same amount of time when the dryer was new."
1,Poor Product,"I was excited to purchase and use this product. I used this product, followed all of the instructions as directed and in the process it got stuck in the dryer vent and had to hire a professional. I would not recommend this product at all!! I take back any previous review because I never used the product prior giving a review. Stay away from this product and hire the professionals!"
3,LintEater System and Ext. Kit,"Well, I did read the instructions and understood everything...but, how are you suppose to attach this thing to a drill? There is no bit on the end of any extension rod...so I went with the Macgyver root, duct tape!! Well, I use the duct tape on each extension rod so they would not come apart and also around the drill tip, worked fine for the first cleaning attempt, the second attempt, the brush head became unattached inside my wall!!! Once again, I Macgyvered a pushing mechanisism to retreive the bristle. I really think there should be a better design...SUPERGLUE THE BRISTLE HEAD TO THE 1ST CONNECTING ROD and you'll have less headache. This was a stupid design. Something should lock into place so that it doesn't become un-attached."
2,Brush got stuck in the vent,"Tried it with my vent which has almost a 90 degree curve at the beginning. The brush wasn't moving forward anymore so I reversed the drill, the brush to detached and stuck in the vent where I cannot reach it anymore. This is totally defective product, if I didn't have a problem before, now I most certainly do - 'the linteater brush stuck in my vent' where I can't reach it."
3,Not impressed,"I was looking for a new sound in music. I love the song ""Crazy"" which they played on the radio first and I am amused my the Boogie Monster song. However, his voice gets a little annoying after a while and I am not quite sure what most of the sounds are actually about. This CD is for those who live outside of the box."
3,Nice but color is too light,Nice trivet but the color is faded. Not sure if this was the intended color but it looks almost white with a hint of pink. Totally functional - only disappointed with the color.
2,Merle Haggard #2,"I just keep hoping one day that Haggard will make a recording like he did in the 70's and 80's. In that nice clear voice. I gave up buying his new cd's because all of them have one thing I can't stand: Merle trying to sound and phrase like Willie Nelson. I don't like the growl or the shaking in his voice. Instead of trying to sound like what everyone thinks Merle Haggard sounds like, he needs to be himself again.I know I have made some people mad with this review, and I am sure if you like this Merle Haggard #2 that surfaced in 1994 you will love this cd. But as for me I will listen to my old records and watch my old tapes of him. And I am sure I am not the only one who feels this way."
5,painstaking book on great chess artist,tigran petrosian had a reputation as a drawing master but to become world champion you have to win games and in this book there are wins against fischer botvinnik tal spassky and most of the greats of the time. the book takes us up to the point where petrosian wins the world chess championship in 1963.every game is annotated with great care by the author who obviously had access to russian sources. i know of no other book where petrosians victories are handled with such deep explanatory comments. he was a great artist of the chess board and this book does real justice both to his results and his games.the bok is also very well produced with clear print and diagrams at the key moments. i only have one regret and that is that petrosians great win against keres from the 1959 candidates tournament does not appear in the list of chosen games.
3,"So cute, but...","These are highly cute shoes and a great price, but the fact is that they're highly uncomfortable. I wore them for about 2 and a half hours and had blisters on both feet, and the worst part is that 1.5 of those hours I was just sitting in the car on a long ride, luckily I was going to a mall and could by a new pair there. Too bad!"
2,Nothing that really stands out here,"I was disappointed after listening to the album. All of the songs are very, very similar.Practically none of them had anything to entice me to listen a 2nd time.While some beats and tracks were able to drive a few head-bobbing sessions from me, they get old too fast. Not something I'll set out to listen to again.Bare in mind, this is simply my personal opinion in music. Everyone's tastes differ(or should), so take my words with a grain of salt.However, the music is all very similar on this album."
4,Seeing the unseen,"I was amazed at all the details the author pulled out of the forest -- he truly is an expert in his field and a wonderful observer/teacher.Given how well he could explain events from a series of linked observations and how well he was able to teach it, I'm wondering if there is a analog in my profession. Given the same level of observation there is probably far more to learn in what we experience everyday.This book is a great gift for the hiker, nature lover or professional who likes to learn."
4,LOVE IT,"My grand daughter loved this Nurse's Costume. It has given her many hours of fun play activity. It isn't made of a very sturdy material, but she had outgrown it within a year so it held up well enough for what it was purchased for. B+"
5,great travel adventures in 15th century feudal france,"One of the later Waverley novels, ""Quentin Durward"" is nothing short of great. I love it. It's full of adventure, couleur locale, action (Scott's romances seem to get more bloody as the series progressed--this one was published nine years after the first), and colorful characters.I think this is one of the most engaging of all the Waverleys. The plot is not overburdening, and the romantic interest of the main character is even more impossible than in most of the others. Scott made the jump from Scotland (and later England) to the continent very successfully: I highly recommend this book.Note: this review refers to the OUP edition, which is cheap and very well done--and hopefully available."
1,Get the Bible book instead!,There is a awful lot of information missing in this book.I suggest purchasing the bible book instead of this one.apparently it was probably rushed and not written by an actual 'experienced'user of the program itself.
2,Broken center button?,The iPod works. But the center button is pushed in. I can kind of use it to select stuff. But it's broken. I'm disappointed.
4,Question,"The last reviewer bitched because of the video screen . What if you want to hook up your ipod to a tv, do the ""music only"" ipods allow for that? If they do then he's right theres no reason for a ""video"" ipod. I want the cheapest Ipod with at least 20 GB, that alows me to hook up it up to a tv. Are refurbsanygood?"
3,Apple has a racket,"I purchased this I-Pod through Amazon, new...it did not work.I went to the Apple Store who replaced it. What does Apple replaceit with? Most likely a re-furbished model. While it works and I likeit, if I wanted to purchase a re-furbished model I could have done soand saved at least $35-50."
3,Apple 30 GB iPod video (5.5 Generation),"Although the iPod is simple to use and the gadget itself rates 5 stars, as a first-time user, I'm totally unimpressed with the iTunes software which you'll need to learn if you want to load that new toy. The iTunes documentation (including its integrated help) is maddening. It is absolutely terrible at describing detailed options. For instance, what is a compilation, what's the advantage of checking it? How does one save an audiobook? Be prepared to do some web surfing if you want to learn the useful features. It's as though it's intended to be learned by someone else."
5,Perfect.,"I wanted to upgrade from the 1st generation iPod Nano for three main reasons: one - it was about time; two - the screen was smashed; and three - I needed more space. My tastes in music expanded greatly over the past 10 or so years, and 4 GB just wasn't cutting it. I ordered this sometime last year, and I absolutely love it. 30 GB is more than enough space for me, and for a little over $80 as opposed to upwards of $200, this is quite a deal. The description listed by the seller was very accurate, which is also good. Thanks so much, and I would definitely recommend this product. :)"
4,Worth the money,"I was in the market to replace my ipod shuffle, and originally picked up the Zune. The Zune however only loaded about 10% of my music, no matter how I tried, so I returned it the next day and exchanged it for the 30 gig 5G ipod w/ video. Aside from the lousy ear buds, everything else about this player is great. The sound is good, as is its ease of use. Despite the 2.5 inch screen, the picture quality was top notch. Perfect for my commute to work and home again. Best of all it loaded all of my music (which is all legally purchased, something the Zune didn't seem to care about) which is the main reason I got it in the first place. The cloth holder kept it scratch free until I bought a case to protect it in. All in all I like it quite a bit, even though I am still not fond of itunes. There are other programs to use however."
4,Good item,Good item. I have been using it for 1 month and so far its working well. Item is exactly as the description.
4,excellent product but battery is not easy to replace.,Awesome product the only flaw is the battery is not replaceable by yourself if at all.
2,so so player,"Poor sound quality, music sounds flat not rich and vibrant like it should be. It also lacks support for many file types but rockbox can fix that and help with the sound quality to. syncing is annoying it writes songs to a hidden folder and renames them with jargon names. It cant be managed like a flash drive unless you use rock box. It feel fragile and scratches. apples firm ware is pathetic rock box is better but not perfect."
2,Disk failed within a year of use,"Beware.... the hard disk failed within a year of use. Repair costs more than buying a new ipod. And I have an ipod nano 1st generation that is 3 years old and working perfectly, with the same rate of usage."
4,"Great, but has a sluggish interface","I upgraded from the previous generation iPod (4g), and expected this new iPod to be better in every way...well it is better in every way but one. The interface is comparatively very slow to respond to input. When you try to navigate through your songs, there is always a slight delay. And when you scroll through your music, it goes scroll scroll stop (for a quarter second)...scroll scroll stop.Overall this is a great player, and I am surprised they didn't put a faster processor in there."
3,3 Stars,I rate this 3 stars as far as an I Pod product the vendor on the other hand sent me a excellent condition used GB. i bought this to replace my GB classic and I knew it wouldn't handle as much but the battery life is maybe 8 hrs. I needed more so broke down and got the exact replacement for my 80GB classic. I did give this to my nephew who is using it with no complaints.
1,apple needs to stop figuring out how to break prods,i personally dont like this product. this is the 2nd ipod i've bought. they battery life if bad and unless you connect it directly to your computer vs. a usb hub it doesnt charge. apple needs to spend more time figuring out how to break their prods and more time keeping them working.
1,not working,"It worked for two weeks, then after a upgrade of Itunes everything on the Ipod disappeared and nothing will load. Very frustrating."
3,Loopy iPod 30 GB,"Amazon had it at my door in 2 days. Setup was easy and it worked perfectly...until my wife disconnected it when it said ""do not disconnect."" Restoring it online is supposed to get it back to normal, but the process takes a few minutes and loops back to where it starts. I checked Apple online forums, and many people claim the same problem occurs even whithout the accidental disconnect. I'm taking it to an apple retailer, but am worried because Amazon mixed up receipts and I wound up with someone's book receipt."
1,disappointed,I am unable to give a review. This was a birthday gift. Amazon showed it was in stock but kept changing the ship/delivery date. Then I was contacted after 3 changes and the date was well after the date of the birthday so I had to cancel and purchase the ipod from Wal-Mart. :(
4,Awesome lil thang!,"After a long time now I finally decided I wanted an Ipod. At first, I was looking at a nano but decided that the Ipod video was the best priced system. I had previously owned a creative mp3 player which turned out to be junk and the sound quality was terrible. You could only play music on that, but with the Ipod video, you could not only listen to mp3's but watch videos and view photos and play games downloaded from iTunes. If you're going to get an Ipod, I highly recommend getting this Ipod over the Ipod nano because it seems to be cheaper and you get 30GB for $250 on the Ipod video while you get 8GB for $200 on the nano. I would recommend getting a protective case for the Ipod video. A friend told me that they can be easily scratched. You can usually get one for under $20 at Walmart."
3,The First Bad... The Second Very Good,"The first Ipod was damage, and do not work, but the second is very good"
2,"So far, not so good...","Got this as a gift for Christmas from Amazon. After receiving the iPod (my second after my old iPod died), I plugged it in charged it for 6 hours. I used it for maybe 30 minutes, then turned it off for the night. Woke up in the morning to find that not only was the battery totally drained, but it had reset the clock and calendar to the year 2000. I recharged it now for 8 hours turned it off, and left it over night. Came back to in the morning and it had once again totally discharged. I am now returning it as I think it's defective. I have to wait now for Amazon to receive the broken iPod, then ship me out a new one. Ugh...This is the last time I buy something from an online retailer. The return process is too much of a pain."
1,Not What it Looks Like,"This product was described as ""very good"". The battery wouldn't stay charged for more than 15 minutes and the button that selects the songs didn't work properly. I had to return it to Apple and pay for an upgrade."
1,Apple stinks,"I do not have a 30GB, mine is an older (2 years) 20 GB. I actually only used my ipod for 7 months and then it stopped working. When I tried getting support from Apple, they told me my warranty was expired and since we didn't purchase an extended one, they couldn't help me. They said it was probably a hardware issue and they can become corrupt at any time. I paid $300.00 for an ipod and cannot believe that after using it for 7 months it just stopped working. I am so unhappy with Apple I will never buy another product from them again. They dominate the market, charge a fortune for their products and then refuse to help unless you pay another $60 for an extended warranty. Plus, I find it hard to believe they cannot explain to me how one day it works and the next day it is corrupted."
2,good but could have been much better...,"I am writing this review moments after finishing this book. THE SURROGATE was a very interesting novel and kept me guessing throughout, which is the type of book I find very entertaining. The problems I had though are with the author's insistant use of profanity and sexual scenes. The profanity was way to graphic and completly useless. It seemed as though she through them in for shock value which did nothing to help the story. Especially the scene where the lawyer described sex with his wife. What did that accomplish in moving the story forward?! Absolutely positively NOTHING! Also, the sexual scenes between Jamie and Joe weren't needed either. The author successfully painted a picture of a couple very much in love but the sex scenes just made it sound tawdry and immature. ""His [...] was amazing"". Stupid wording. Let their love have meaning. Let it mean more and leave a lot more to the reader's imagination. We will thank you for it later."
4,Not a bad read,"Okay, the ending is implausible, but the steps leading to it are entirely believable and scary in a conspiracy-theory kind of way. The evangelical preacher type who really seems to believe what she is saying (and has blinders on when it comes to the real-world evil her family is capable of), the smart, yet naive young girl and her emotional ride through a surrogacy, the evil governmental puppet-master...well his story (especially the ending) is the part where you kind of question the story. Still, it was a very entertaining story for a day home in bed and sick."
5,I just bought the Saucony Mens Grid Omni 5 Moderate,"Wonderful shoe as all of there products, only thing better would be walking/running on air with wings and I am not ready for that yet. I am a large runner (230/ 6'2) and love the shoes. THANKS FOR DOING IT AGAIN SAUCONY"
4,Valuable Study,"The doctrine of infant baptism has been a controversial one in the churches of the Reformation. Many denominations argue that the doctrine lacks Biblical foundation. To address this question Geoffrey Bromiley wrote this concise study of the question some years ago. It's good to see this book in print again. As Bromiley notes there is no question that adults who come to faith out of paganism are to be baptized. The issue is whether children of believers should be baptized. While the New Testament doesn't explicitly say ""yes,"" there are good reasons to support the practice. Most importantly, if the children of believers are members of the church, then it follows that they should be baptized. Particularly strong is Bromiley's linking of the practice of infant baptism to a Calvinist approach to predestination. This is a brief, but rewarding book on a controversial subject."
3,I really wanted to like it.,I really want to support Buddhist Nuns; they are very admirable. However their chanting was so high pitched that I couldn't enjoy it. I'm just one person though. The breadth of the chants on this cd is wonderful.
5,Spirit Music,"This audio recording is awesome!!!! We literally get to listen to Buddhist nuns chanting their various songs. It is mostly verbal with some ""instruments"" (bells & conch shell - super cool!) periodically included. I love these ladies! These chants are sung to cleanse the spirit and bring one closer to god. I use to uplift my soul when I'm down or to celebrate when I'm happy! I also use it to cleanse the NRG in my house, sometimes while I smudge. I highly recommend it."
3,"Nice, but not a ""travel"" humidor","It states its a travel humidor, however, it isnt. If youre looking for a travel humidor, do not get this one, it has no way of securing to stay shut, does make a nice desk top one though."
1,froze up on several Macs in our household,"Like the previous reviewer, we have found this software package to be disappointing as well. The help file does not work in the Mac version, and so we all found that very frustrating just trying to move along figuring how things work. Then it froze up. Thinking it was because of being on a older iBook (in OSX mode), I ran it on a fairly new MacBookPro and it froze up on that too. Huge disappointment.Broderbund (The Learning Company) offers only some web-based help (29 notes), most of which is for Windows, and none of the notes pertained to our problem. There is no phone or email help for this software. Even for the low price, it is a waste of money. My 8 yo is very disappointed."
5,Itst great to learn how to frolic after 50!!,I love this book. There are too many women who don't have fun and don't know how. This book tells you how to do it and where to go to get some fun--particularly if your idea of fun is tracking down some guys.
2,Disappointed,"Where have all the great brass and horns in soca gone? I harken back to the great soca like ""When the time comes: rebel soca"" and the 1991 band music that I picked up at carnival in Trinidad. This new stuff is mostly synthesizer. I barely find one or two cuts that catches my interest much and many that make me cringe. Unlike the earlier music where every song makes me want to dance and twitch."
3,Nice mandolins,"I liked this because I play mandolin, and I'm learning some of these Hummel compositions. Sweet and mellow."
2,Good game against your friends,"This is a must have for those people who just want to one up their friends. You both play as spies in a single building. Each building is a level, and there are only eight levels. As the spy your mission is to find the exit to the building before the other spy. Ofcourse the other spy is looking for the exit too, so you must set traps, such as spring doors, buckets of acid over the doors, bombs, and other traps to stop him. When one of you die, you start at the beginning of the building again. Its a nice game, but there is no challenge in the one player mode, so it goes by very quickly."
4,an indispensable resource book for my LA practice,"In a Landscape Architect's office, we seem to need four or five resource books to adequately prepare a plant palette. This book comes as close to being perfect for use in South Florida and other similar temperate zones"
2,Defaulty Part,Ordered this part from TKO Auto parts and the next day after installation it broke. After doing some research I learned that the company that makes the part ( Dorman) has since modified the part. I received and new model from another parts company and it is working perfectly.TKO was very helpful in the return of the damaged part and refunded my money as promised.
2,Where's that thump-thump polka rhythm?,"Four of the artists on this CD, as well as the producers of this album and its predecessor, would do well to remember that we polka listeners like good strong thump-thump rhythm and bass. Stas Golonka, Nancy Hlad, and Brian and the Mississippi Valley Dutchmen keep this in mind very well. The rest of the selections vary from pleasant and relaxing to annoying. Have you ever been exposed to that rhythmless, melodyless, shrill music in Greek restaurants? That's what some of these tracks bring to mind. It's almost an a cappella sound, except that it doesn't always have vocals either. Please, guys, add some more bass and rhythm, so you could sound more like Stas, Nancy, and the Dutchmen. I might have given you 4 or 5 stars then."
2,Not great,"I am glad I got this book on the cheap. The recipes include ingredients that are not readily accesible. What she has to say is fine, is true, I think, but not a really good book to really sink your teeth into (place pun here), and use."
2,Don't pick this one...,A very poor recording of the Yankee Doodle Dandy soundtrack. Sounds as if the person making the recording put a single microphone up against speakers while he or she was playing the video at home.
2,"Cute with capris, skirts, pants; but kind of uncomfortable","I have these in black, and while I find them to go with just about every outfit I wear to work, I wish they were just a little (read: quite a lot) less uncomfortable. Firstly, the insole provided doesn't seem to fit the inside of the shoe properly. Almost like it's too wide. My foot is neither narrow nor wide, so this isn't something I typically notice about a shoe. There is an arch, but because of the weirdly shaped insole it doesn't provide any support. The zig zap strap is a really cute feature that I love, but it just adds to the uncomfort of the shoe. You can tighten the strap to keep your foot from sliding around inside, but then it cuts off circulation and leaves painful imprints. If you leave it too loose then you leave your feet pretty unstable.All in all, a versatile mary jane with good looks but no comfort."
5,laugh n learn spanish,A gift from my youngest daughter. I love it. it makes learning fun. it challenges you and entertains you. a fun way to learn.
4,Great Tone,"Great Humbucking tone, simple installation and bam! Instant Angus. I put this in the bridge position of my 1984 SG and am very pleased. The only thing I did different was switch the polarity by putting the hot lead on the negative point and the neg lead on the hot point on the volume pot."
4,Bluegrass,These are the best ladies in bluegrass by far. If you like this kind of music you will keep this on top of your CD list.
4,Angels are singing.,Bought this CD to listen for pleasure and inspiration. The songs are well done and enjoyable. If you like Southern Gospel you'll like this.
4,His a family man,"He has a little girl that thinks she is a dancer, he is tring to squeeze football in to his busy life."
5,Mistoke Dwayne for Ben Stiller,"I own this movie on Pay-Per-View on my Tivo. Like the title says above, when I first saw this movie I thought Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson was Ben Stiller from Night at the Mueseum and Madagascar. Madison Pettis is not new to Disney's work. She played Megan on Corey in The House which is still on Disney Channel. Overall a hilarious movie. I am technically reviewing this in preperation of Super Bowl XLIII (or Super Bowl 43). This is good film also for football fans. Unlike myself, I just play at school in PE, but I don't mean to brag, but I scored quite a couple touchdowns."
5,really cute movie,this is a great movie. The little girl is darling. Good clean movie for the whole family worth getting and watching over and over.
3,Great parent movie,"The Rock is not a particularly good actor and The Gameplan is a hokey movie. But if you have children like I do, then this movie will pull on all the right heartstrings. There's a bunch of these movies where a child that someone didn't know about comes into their life at just the wrong moment. Things are hard at first, then they get things going smoothly, just to have a final big bump in the road that must be overcome. We all know the plot, but it never hurts to see a movie that reminds you that your kids are the most important thing. Not to mention, my son thought the bulldog in the tutu was hilarious."
1,The dvd was so scratched i threw it away!,"I love the movie and wanted one for myself, the one I received was soooooo scratched that you couldn't even watch it! I threw it away:( thanks for nothing."
1,Unfunny slap stick comedy,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen bar none!! It was'nt funny, it wasn't cute it was all a bunch of silly stupid nonsense. I'd rather have watched Lucy and Ricky. I'm annoyed I wasted 45 minutes of my precious life watching this movie before I just couldn't watch another second. I tried to give it a fair shake before judging it. Walt would be disappointed."
4,Entertaining Movie - The Game Was Well Planned,"This is a history of a football player who thought that had it all until he met his 8 year old daughter and then develops with her a relationship to the point where he realizes he could not live anymore without her.This movie is touchy, funny and has all elements of a typical Disney release, including a happy-ending. Recommended. Four stars."
4,decent family viewing,"has everything muscle , curves , humor , action , family , screw-up & redemption of sorts .Dean does what i think of as his ""bestest"". ""man-card"" is a great line to watch for ...."
5,Good Compilation,Russell was a sharp writer. This collection of essays co-authored and edited by Pigden is a great point to introduce ethics to an slightly more sophisticated audience.
5,scarab is deep,The ryhmes of scarab will blow your mind. His style and metaphors are second to none. You need this CD. Not only are the lyrics sick but it will bump your subs quite nicely
3,Meh,Not sure where this fits in regarding the timeline of the Blue Moon Dancers we meet during the Vampire convention in Rhodes.
2,I Can't Read It All,"There are many good thoughts and observations in this book, and I had high hopes for it initially. However, it reads like the publisher asked for 200 + pages and Dr. Weiss expanded her thoughts to fill the space allotted. Although I hate abridged books generally, this one would be a great candidate for aggressive editing. I'd love to see it boiled down to its essentials, but I'm not interested enough in the author's personal experiences to read the whole thing."
3,Great stories -- but better editions are available.,"I love Grace Livingston Hill stories, and was disappointed to learn that the books in this series have been edited! (I believe the term used is ""updated for modern audiences."") After purchasing many Grace Livinigston Hill books, I strongly prefer Tyndale House editions over these collections. Not only do they claim to retain all original text, but the Tyndale House books seem to be printed on higher quality paper."
5,For the collector,"My collector friend needed all the Simpsons games and this was the last one he needed. Bought as a gift for him...needless to say, he was happy overall and was happy with the condition of the game itself!"
1,Really miss the original April Fresh,I have happy memories associated with the original April Fresh scent. I'm saddened that it is no longer available. The new smell is terrible.
1,Phew!!!!! Not your old Downy,"I loved the old April Fresh Downy that I began to use 40 years ago. That new odor (not aroma) is overwhelming and smells like bubblegum- or cheap perfume. I wish that they would bring back the original. There are so many complaints on line. I keep looking for another comparable softener, but so far no luck. The closest I've found is the yellow bottle Suaveatel or Snuggle. Downy's dryer sheets still smell the same but don't soften as well. Sigh."
1,BYe BYe DOWNY!!!,new scent is horrible. can't believe in a million years someone at P&G thought this was a good idea. EPIC FAIL!!!
4,"Another dose of unusual, soothing music","Kimba Arem is a very talented and knowledgeable lady. Her music introduced me to some unusual ancient, indigenous instruments producing sounds that soothe, heal and transform. I am particularly thrilled about discovering the four-chambered flute and its deeply moving sound which resonates with me like I am returning to some ancient home from a previous life.I give this CD 4 stars only because for me there isn't enough of that particular instrument on it. I also recommend ""Gaearth Dreaming"" and ""Self-Healing with Sound and Music"""
5,Truly Disgusting...A Successful Gift!,"I bought this for my grandson and the following is the review I received from my son, his father:Let me say thanks for the absolutely nasty s**t I had to put my hand into. It was like a bowl of cold snot! Isaac loved every second of every experiment. Lisa will have to give you the rest of the details. Thanks again. Maybe he can do some to (for) you."
5,Fun for all,This toy keeps kids occupied for hours. What did doesn't like to learn about gross things. Depending on the age they will need a little adult supervision.
1,boring,"My 6 year old got this for his birthday. The petri dishes were ok in concept, but it took so long to a) put them together and b) get stuff to grow on them, he lost interest. The experiments do seem a little shabby and boring, not real science at all. Most of the kit is still in the bag in the closet. My son loves ""science"" and is always putting together his own little experiments (most with no purpose, but hey, he's 6! This was just kindof lame. Meh."
1,I put this book down...,"after a 100 pages or so. The ""hero"" was a misogynist who constantly called the ""heroine"" a ""little flirt"" and he had no respect for her (and all women) due to his past wife's affairs. I just could not get into this book. This was my first experience with this author."
4,Loved this book - even years later,"I came across this book while cleaning out my storage unit where, I'm sad to say, hundreds of my books languish for lack of space to put them. I remembered this being a great book but I thought well that was years ago it probably isn't as good as I remember....NOT so!! I reread it and still loved it this time around....yes Hunter is a pain in the butt, yes he misunderstands and misreads Elyssa. I saw one reviewer state that it was because his wife had been unfaithful that he bore a grudge against women, I think they're missing the big picture, the real issue was what his wife and her affairs cost him - the lives of his 2 children, the horror of losing not one but both of his kids, and taking that into consideration it's amazing he could function as well as he did. The heroine was able to see past the bitterness to the person he was underneath. I think it's an amazing story and I enjoyed it."
5,So good you must buy it!,"different types of styles which mix well on this album. Even though not well known out of Germany,a good CD and all of the tracks are worth listening to. 5/5"
5,WONDERFUL FOOD!,"This is a cookbook for people who like to cook, but aren't necessarily technically skilled. I find this book very entertaining and interesting. Jamie offers information on how to prepare and store different types of foods. I like that this book teaches you to become a more creative and less exact cook. Thumbs up!"
3,The essence doesn't last,Nice cologne but the essence vanishes quickly. I expected that it would last for at least 6 hours but it doesn't last for more than 90 minutes.
4,Good service,"The service was ok, it took more days than I expected , the box was not sealed.Overall was ok !!!!"
2,NOT Tonka Quality! Horrible!,"Don't get your hopes up for you little one for this toy! We bought it for our three year old for christmas and are very disappointed! The ladder is bound to break off within the first few uses, the sounds don't work at all, and the doors are really bad quality and are likely to break very soon if he tries to use them at all. The whole thing is a flimsy piece of crap, and is not at all the Tonka quality we have known to love. I took a chance on this toy since my little 3 year old wanted a fire truck so badly, but it wasn't worth it. This toy won't last long, and he is not a rough kid!!!!"
3,Tonka lights and sound fire engine,"I bought this for my grandson, who is 4. It was not as large as I had hoped. I was disappointed that it is plastic, as Tonka, to me, had big metal, sturdy, last forever, trucks. It says sounds and lights..those are minimal. The doors don't open. It is basically a disappointment and does not merit the ads for it."
5,Amazing Video,This video is great and can really help with running group programs. I showed this to all of my co-workers and they loved it. Learning through enjoyment is the way to go!
1,Dissapointment,"This drill was my first, and last, Milwaukee tool purchase. It is just out of warranty, 1 year, and I have used it very little (maybe 15 battery charges). When it first arrived it had one bad battery. I received a replacement which is ok, but now the other battery is bad. I keep the batteries and charger indoors so I don't believe heat/cold are to blame. Also, the drill now has a noticeable burning smell whenever it is operated.I have owned several other cordless drills and all of them performed better than this one. If you're looking to buy, I recommend you keep looking."
1,"Great idea, but that's about it.","I've tried to use my disc diver several times because my home course has several water hazards. Many of these are deep and you cannot see the disc, then obviously the disc diver cannot be used because you are just trowing blindly into the water. On a few holes, I have been able to see my disc and tossed this thing out there but it did not grab the disc, it just passed over it and I had to walk out there anyway. Great idea, but I don't recommend this to anyone."
4,"Beware, though","The games are great! I am addicted to Star Collector.However, I recommend when you install to not allow it to happen automatically. Several Hoyle products want to install another program that is not necessary to play the games. If it doesn't come up with Hoyle cancel and do a manual install from the disc. You don't need more icons installed, more TSR programs running in the background.I am not positive this was one, but I got three games at once. Two had it (Board Games, Puzzle Games, Card Games). Not sure which two had it. It will tell you that you cannot install without it. LIES."
5,A Wonderful Song!,"Another wonderful work from Jan Karon. Sweeps you into another world, upward ever higher til you see the face of heaven. So refreshing to read uplifting,wholesome works full of grace and redemption. Very reminiscent of Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin. I always look forward to the next Jan Karon novel!"
3,Disappointed!,"Karon must have hired a ghost writer, as this book is not nearly as enticing and soothing as former books. Most of the book is based on Father Tim's train-of-thought inner dialog and is full of biblical quotes, uninspired comments, and preachy advice to others. Typical Tim answers to others are such things as ""Aha,"" ""OK,"" and ""Amazing."" Karon has run out of plot and vocabulary. Especially jarring are her once-trendy slang words, all issuing from Tim's 65-year-old mouth: ""Pumped up,"" ""couple of,"" ""on their turf,"" ""out of here,"" ""schlepping,"" ""pretty good,"" and ""dadgum blasted rough."" Boring!"
2,A New Song,The Mitford series was recommended to me. I just read A New Song. It is a bit more Christianity that I want. I doubt if I will read any of the others in the series.
5,"Wonderful, of course","In this 5th book of the Mitford series, Father Tim takes a short-time interim pastor position away from his beloved Mitford. Even though he's away from the wonderful folks back home, some have a surprise visit, and there are side stories from Mitford, so don't worry that it will all be different. The story is lovely and the characters in this little town are as personable. Even the difficult ones are worth getting to know. News from these characters comes into the following Mitford books.It's a Jan Karon book, so how can you go wrong."
3,"nice music, a bit bland, but still like it","The music is well played, mostly instrumental, and by a sort of non-descript ochestra, but after many times listening to it (mosting while riding in the car) it surely is better than most radio music... and it doesn't get as boring as you might think.Weber is good, it's hard to ""not like"" it."
3,Hitchcock Shares Mayhem with Schifrin,"Let the buyer beware: six of the thirteen tracks on this disc have nothing to do with Hitchcock soundtracks. The final 20+ minutes of the disc contains the music of conductor Lalo Schifrin, which is fine if the distributor will change the disc title. If you are a big fan of Hitchcock films and their music, you may be a bit disappointed in some of these renderings, especially the tempos. The ""North by Northwest Overture,"" which opens the CD, lacks the excitement of the original due to the slow tempo. The ""Alfred Hitchcock Theme"" (Gounod's ""Funeral March of the Marionette"") is performed at a much faster tempo than fans of the television show will remember. Overall the disc is pretty good, but listening made me want to view the original films and hear the original soundtracks even more."
5,Another Brilliant Work from Anouar Brahem,"Anouar Brahem is a great artist. He manages to sound modern and archaic at the same time. His most recent previous album, Astrakan Cafe, evokes a North Africa, with his oud accompanied by clarinet and percussion. My favorite of his previous albums, Compte de l'Incroyable Amour, is a work of great spirituality and heart.This album, Le Pas Du Chat Noir, with accompaniment from a piano and clarinet, sounds like sophisticated Parisian parlor art song, but of what era? Debussy's? Piaf's? Ravel's? Brahem's!Typically perfect ECM audio engineering allows the listener to fall deeply into this music's thrall. Highly recommended."
3,Ordinary,"I love mint, and when I read that this perfume has hints of it, I bought it immediately.Unfortunately, the mint note is very subtle. In fact, the scent itself is very subtle, and wears off quickly. (Maybe because it can be used on kids?) It's either that, or my nose just adjusts to it too fast. Way too fast.Anyway, I use this everyday, but I'm looking for a stronger, mintier fragrance. Guerlain Aqua Allegorica Herba Fresca is my next target."
4,Solid Carbide...,"The picture is of the 1/2"" version.Milwaukee 48-23-6041 1/2 by 3-3/4-Inch Panel Pilot Router Bit with Drill Point, Double Flute with 1/2-Inch ShankThis bit, the 1/4"" diameter version, is made out of solid carbide, without the insert."
2,Typical smooth jazz,"There is a lot of bad smooth jazz, a little less than a lot of middle-of-the-road smooth jazz, and ahandful of really good smooth jazz. Like all of Colling's records, this one falls in the bottom of the middle. It sounds like all of her records - complete with personal platforms and the occassional vocal track that should have stayed instrumental or not showed up at all, but if you like her you'll like this. It doesn't sound any different than much of the other smooth jazz that isn't flat-out deplorable and uses the same riffs, arrangements and beats as all of the other mid-level players. It is a typical smooth jazz record. No Norman Brown, no Najee, no Bob James, et al. If you buy this genre as a rule, this one won't stand out to you as any worse than anything else you own. But if you like the good stuff, this won't stand out to you at all."
2,dashboard mount with happy feet.,If you have a curved dash this mount will constantly move. It is annoying to have to always reposition on dash.
2,Very disapointed,It does not stay on the dash as I had hoped. When I accelerate it falls on the floor.
3,Not quite what I wanted,"This wasn't quite what I expected, I like my bean bag dash mount much better. This will probably work well for some people."
3,Garmin Dashboard mount,If the unit had the no slip pads on the bottom of each leg it would be a fabulous product.It slides very easily when you make turns or corners. Have sent my Garmin to the floorboard on numerous occasions.
2,Depends on your vehicle and your driving habit,I gave this a 2 because I primarily got it to use in my '06 Mustang GT. Since the dash is somewhat tilted down and I sometimes drive this car a little aggressively it has flown off the dash on a number of occasions. I gave up using it in the Mustang but it works great in my '05 Ford F-250 which has a flat dash and is even compartmentalized to hold things in.
5,great device,"I recently had a GPS stolen in Buffalo becuase my window seal would not release, however, with the new dashboard mount it is simple to bring the GPS in when I'm not in the car. It holds the GPS securely and it is perfect for sight lines. I think it is great"
2,Garmin GPS Mount,I own an Infiniti QX4 and this mount does not have a flat place to sit on the dash. Becasue of this it slides and does not stay in one place and sometimes falls to the floor. I would not recommend this if you do not have a flat dashboard.
2,not as good as it claims,"Basically, this Dash mount expects the dashboard on my cars(BMW M3 and S2000) is as flat as my dinning table so it won't fly like a UFO if i make a turn. Therefore, i have no choice but to stick with the one which comes with the original package of my C340. Honestly, i don't recommend it to the owners of Bimmer/Honda."
3,garmin dash mount,The dash mount works great. The flexable arms allow u to fit the dash mount on flat or curved surfaces.the only thing i have is that I wish it had more grip power as it will slide if you do a lot of braking and go on rough roads.Otherwise a great product.
1,Not worth it,"The first time I used the dashboard mount, it slid right off my rounded dashboard during a normal left turn. Stick with the windshield mount that comes with the Garmin."
5,This is a great addition to the Garmin GPS!,This is a great addition to the Garmin GPS. It is so easy to use. The Garmin slips in and out with no difficulty. The mount is simple to put into place and then remove and store. It stays perfectly in place while driving.
3,garmin dashboard mount for StreetPilot GPS units,The first one I received wouldn't charge properly and the unit died on me one day. I exchanged it for a new one and I am happy with it. Much better than the suction cup on the windshield that would fall off after a while.
5,Fabulous!,"I bought this after playing with my son's Garmin and realizing that when I got my Garmin, it would be such a hassle to try to stick and unstick the silly gizmo to my Mini windshield each time I used it. This sits nicely on the dash and when I park, just slip it under the seat and no one is the wiser. No fuss no muss for me. Even on rough roads it moved ever so slightly. The best part is that my son has been the trend setter for electronic stuff and this time, Mom was the one to find something he didn't have:)"
3,Garmin Dashboard Mount for c340,"I bought this to be used with the Garmin Street Pilot C340. Since its illegal in Calif to mount the GPS on the windshield this look like a good solution. The device works fine when placed onto a flat dashboard in a vehicle that is not capable of ""sports car like"" performance. In the sports car it will fly around on the dashboard which is not a safe."
3,Friction mount,"I am extremely happy with the product, it is great not having to use the windshield mount. Very easy to use and also improves your overall driving vision."
1,Definitely Wouldn't Buy It Again,"This is definitely a waste of time. It moves all the time, and half the time is spent not making fall into my lap. I have tried it in more than one vehicle and still no success. Definitely not recommended, and you are better off replacing the window mount if it starts to wear out."
4,Great dash mount for garmin C series,The dash mount is quality and easy to adjust. You don't have to worry about a suction cup mount falling off your windshield every few hours. It provides better stability that expected. Good purchase!
5,Garmin Dash Mount,"This mount makes the unit stable on both cars that have distinctly different dashboard configurations. There is little slippage, leaves no marks anywhere and it simply does what it is designed to do."
1,Bad for 2002 Honda Accord,This product did not work as described on my 2002 Honda Accord's dashboard. The unit would move every time I hit a bump or made a sharp turn and it came very close to falling off my dash. After a few blocks I removed it before I got into an accident by trying to catch it if it fell. I assume this product works well with some cars based on all the other positive reviews but I can guarantee this mount is not the right choice for a 2002 Honda Accord.
3,It works...,"I had to buy this product because the winshield mount that came with my GPS device are illegal in California. If this weren't so, I wouldn't use the tripod mount regularly. Maybe it's just my dash, but the tripod slips around quite easily, forcing me to reach over and turn the GPS face back towards my seat so I can see it, or even to prevent the unit from slipping off the dash.It does seem that other reviewers aren't experiencing this, which leads me to believe it is, indeed, my dash (which is slanted), so it would be a good idea to take this into account before purchasing this item. In addition, the vent on my dash is positioned so that it is necessary that one of the ""feet"" of the tripod base must rest upon it in order for me to be able to see the screen, so that might also account for the slippage.If I didn't occasionally take the unit into other cars I'd affix the tripod mount to the dash to solve this problem."
3,Works great! Check first to see if map updates are free before buying.,"We love this dash mount. It stays where it's supposed to, and is easily removed for storing or using in a different vehicle. Just pick it up and take it with you! So glad we got this!I'm updating this review to inform potential buyers to double-check the inability to download updated maps from Garmin without paying an arm & a leg. As freeways and roads are constantly in a state of new construction, altered routes, etc., we attempted to update our device a few months back. Garmin required $129.00 to do this. I haven't checked back again to see if their policy has changed, but wanted to give a heads-up to those folks thinking about buying this item."
5,Good for the price!,I have been using this for several years with no problems. I think it looks good on the dash and it is very sturdy. The price was the selling point for me. It was definitely worth it!
4,Dashboard GPS Mount,Definitely worth the money. I have been able to put my GPS unit where I want it. It also solves the problem of not being allowed to mount the GPS on the windshield -- something that is illegal where I live.
1,miss represented product,"this product was advertised as compatible to the c330 street pilot, however, the power cord that they include will not connect to the c330. It is the wrong cord. I got stuck."
3,Good Idea but.......,"This is a good idea and a must have if you live in California. However, mine didn't work out of the box. One of the brass strips that makes contact with the gps unit was too far in to make a good connection. Since I had no use for the windshield mount, that came with the unit, I cannabilized it for parts and made the dashmount one work. If you get one, I recommend you buy it at a place that you can inspect it before you leave the store."
2,Review of dashboard Garmin mount,It is illegal in New Jersey to mount the GPS on the windshield. The mount enables you to secure it on the dashboard. In doing so on a bright (sunny) day there is a reflction that blurs the view of the map and makes it difficult to see the map on the screen. You will have to depend on the voice for accurate directions.
2,Garmin Dash mount for streetpilot c330,the lock switch does not secure the suction cup to the dash.Gene Roos
1,This is what I paid for?,"The overwhelming reviews make this product sound better than it really is. Depending on the design of your dash board, it either stays very well or slides around when taking corners. The three pads do offer some balance but the overall design is TOP Heavy. If I never had the suction cup before then I wouldn't be as irritated. The two reasons I went with is is due to the portability and 2008 CA state law, ""no mounting devices on the windshield"". For the cost and purpose, put it in a 99cent store."
5,An absolutely essential accessory.,"This is an absolutely essential accessory for your Garmin c-series GPS, for two reasons.First, the windshield suction cup mount supplied with the GPS isn't as reliable as you might think and hope. It will grip tightly, but at completely unpredictable times, it will suddenly release, dumping your GPS onto the floor. When that happens, you'll grab for it, and the results of doing that at highway speeds could be catastrophic. I think this might be caused by changes in the temperature of the windshield as you drive into and out of the sun, turn the heat up and down, etc.Second, in some states, it's illegal to obscure the windshield with anything, and the ticket for doing so can be significant. Even if it's not illegal, it's not a good thing, and this mount solves that problem.The mount is well-built, fits the GPS perfectly, and works exactly the way it's supposed to."
5,DASHMOUNT FOR STREETPILOT C330,I LOVE THIS ITEM. IT STAYS PUT ON THE DASH. IT ENABLES YOU TO REMOVE THE WHOLE UNIT MOUNT INCLUDED WHEN LEAVING YOUR CAR.
4,"still THE doom-album, a classic","For me, this album brings back memories. I first got this on a badly copied tape, but now in all its grand digital glory.This is THE doom-metal album, a true classic, and it hasn't lost any of its power.'A soundtrack to the apocalypse', this should be in any metalhead's collection."
4,Winnie the Pooh ABC's,"Very enchanting movie! Not a comprehensive spelling lesson as the editorial review says, but nonetheless, a great starting point for letter recognition and sound. My 2yo absolutely loves this one and also the 123 video too. Definitely favorites in our house:o)"
5,Video Game Football At Its Best,I'll keep this short and sweet--There is no other game for any other system with more testosterone/adrenaline-action than Tecmo Super Bowl (sorry madden fans).The greatest NES sports game ever made. Period.
5,My Hero Paul,"If you are looking to start a mushroom business or intensify your hobby, Stamets gives a good break down of what possible avenues you can take and what it is going to take to put out a lot of mushrooms. It is the most comprehensive and easy to follow guides to mushroom growing that i have found."
3,Has convinced me to wait on this project.,I can see that there is a lot more to growing mushrooms than I ever imagined. I guess that is a good thing to know before starting a new hobbie.
3,Not for me,"This book is maybe great if you want to start a professional operation but for those wanting to grow some mushrooms for the table it is not the right book. After some general introduction he starts how a mushroom laboratory should look like and how sterile everything must be and this laboratory must have with three doors (Putting one door in is challenging for me!). Aren't there simpler methods?We cannot easily buy spawn in Australia,so I can't really rely on bought stuff, but haven't mushrooms been grown since ages without a laboratory?Stammets is not very good in describing difficult things in a simple way and he uses a lot of scientific terms.As far as I know, there is no book on the market which covers the basic of mushroom growing for those who don't want to invest more than some dollars.Apart from that, the book is quite thorough."
3,"Great voice commands, not so great in bright sun.","Voice commands, accuracy, ease of use, touch screen are all wonderful. In bright sunshine, wearing presciption sunglasses with polarized lenses I can barely see the screen. Night time use is wonderful."
4,Garmin Lives up to their promise,"I recently moved to the Phoenix area and have to drive all over the Valley. This unit does live up to their promise out of the box. If you go to Garmin's website, you can download updated drivers, computer to c320 unit interface that allows you to customize the unit for your purposes. With the standard SD card slot, you can upload huge areas with good detail. The address or site imput is quick and easy and the detail is so good that it will even tell you on which side of the street a location is. This unit saves me so much time and trouble travelling from point to point. I cannot wait to download 3D topo maps for off-higway driving."
3,good GPS,"I had the unit for over 3 yrs and it still works fine. Although the down-side is you need to purchase a separate memory card to down load entire U.S. map from CD. If you are living in the city with tall buildings, I would not recommand ... unit tends to lose the location and keeps re-routing and get you lost. A decent unit if you are looking for a general purpose GPS need."
5,Great GPS at a great price,"This GPS has many pros like fast reroute calculations, nice touch screen, great visibility during day time, clear voice prompt, etc.I can't think of any other cons except that the software it comes with can have little more functions like finding picnic spots at a given location."
4,Awesome unit @ a great price,"This is a very nice unit for someone who just wants the basics. I bought a 1 gig card for $14 and I have all the maps installed that I'll ever need. 2 reasons for 4 stars vs. 5. The volume, to me, needs to be at least 3/4 up to hear over normal conversation or moderate radio volume and I wish it had a case. Very, very happy with it's ease of use and display."
3,Not perfect but make you feel safe,"You can not rely on this product totally for the following reasons.1. The route it gives may not be the best one.2. It only tells how far the next turn is but not telling the name of the street. It takes a while to get used to it. I still peek on the screen to see the street name before I turn.3. Since it does not give naming direction, if you are in the intersection of serveral highways, you should just count on yourself."
2,ok,Product is a great product packaging was bad it came dripping all over the place was horrible wish they would have packaged it better yuck!
1,loved it until it went racid after only a month,"I bought a bottle of Home Health Castor oil from my local health foods store about a month ago and it doesn't expire for another TWO YEARS and I was very disappointed to find a large mold cloud forming in the bottom of the bottle (which is a clear bottle so it's very easy to see). I thought because it was cold pressed and the only ingredient is ""Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil"" that it could be stored at room temperature (I haven't read anywhere that it needed to be store in the fridge, no where on the product label either). I've always kept Olive oil and jojoba oil out of the fridge and they do fine. I guess I would recommend to others to try keeping it in the fridge. I and VERY DISAPPOINTED, MONEY WASTED."
2,If you wear hard or gas permeable lenses be careful.,"This little gadget does a fair job of cleaning the protein build-up on lenses, but it also has a heating element that makes the cleansing solution extremely hot. The heat could possibly warp your (hard) lenses and change the perscription necessitating the need to buy a new pair of lenses."
4,Works great,"This product works great, but it only comes with one cleaning basket. So if the basket hinge breaks you have to throw the complete cleaner away. I've bought some cleaners with two baskets and those are the ones that I would recommend purchasing. I couldn't find any at the time of this purchase.As for the seller no issues.Rich"
3,like it,"I have had it for about 4 years now, and its still standing. Some drawers ate broke because you cannot put tons of stiff in them , but other wide that are pretty sturdy have gone through five moves and still standing. !"
3,Not Bad,"I Bought this running CD as well as the Navy Seals one. I personally found the Navy Seals more motivating. This one is good, but it is very repetative and get kind of dull."
5,*snaps* for Chet,"Even a young musician can appreciate the smooth sound of Chet Baker. ""My Funny Valentine"" is timeless. This CD is truly a dream."
3,NOT ALL THAT GREAT,"Basically, there are two things that really drag this game down. First of all, like many other NES games there is no save option OR password option. You HAVE to beat it in one sitting. Finally, you think beating it in one sitting sounds easy? Believe me, this game will challenge even the best of video-gamers. You probably CAN beat it, just expect to replay the game a million times until you can recite the level layout in your sleep. Although it didn't detract from my limited enjoyment of the game, I though that some of the graphics were downright goofy. I mean, Luke Skywalker looks like he's wearing a diaper for crying out loud! But now on to the positive. The game follows the movie closely, as it should. You can play as Leia, Luke, or Han Solo. You can also fly a variety of vehicles. But overall, this game is just not that good, for all the reasons I mentioned above. The sequel (The Empire Strikes Back for NES), however, was much better."
5,Reliable and quiet.,"After my shopvac died during a drywall sanding job, I decided to buy something better. This unit is designed for drywall sanding. Since I do a lot of woodworking, the tool triggered start function on this Vac also really comes in handy. Cheaper than the festool ct-33 and fein products, this unit still has a HEPA filter and offers similar performance. I have been especially impressed with the quiet operation. The suction is good and the filter works great.My only dislike is the hose, which is cheap plastic... but that's probably why this unit is so much more affordable than the festool (which has a heavy duty anti-static hose). Also, don't expect any sweeping attachments- you don't get any.I have always been impressed by porter cable's no-nonsense design and rugged construction, and this vacuum is no exception."
3,My First Listen to Soft Cell,"I heard two songs on a local station here in Sydney 'Tainted Love' and 'Where Did Our Love Go' that really sounded good. So I got this CD never hearing Soft Cell before these two songs and didn't know what to expect. This is a Brittish pop group from the 80's and early 90's now retired. Not entirely a bad CD but many of the songs didn't appeal to me. The last 6 songs were the best of the entire CD including the two remixes using modern DJ's. Two other songs which were interesting to listen too were 'Loving You Hating Me' and 'Soul Inside'. If all the songs on this CD sounded like these above, the album would have really been 'A very best of' compilation."
4,Entertaining for the old school,"This game is a oldie but definite goodie. It certainly isn't the greatest game ever, but back then, it was a solid title. it's fun in its simplicity, though I enjoyed the skateboarding levels more than the surf. I spent most of the time I played this game on the skateboarding part, and it's fun. There's cool tricks you can do to rack up the points, and all in all, this ain't a bad NES title at all. Forget XBox and all that fancy schmancy junk, sometimes you just can't beat the old school."
3,Not Bad,"This book was a typical biography, good for reports and whatnot, it has some of Turner's Paintings, and it has a lot of information."
4,Mr. Undesirable,"Scott Carpenter's book, Mr. Undesirable, is wonderful. His main character, Lenny Kapowski, is so well developed that I felt like I knew him. The story basically draws the reader in on pape one. Those of you who were teenagers in the 1980s will relate, in some way, to what happens to Lenny and the emotions he feels about it. There were so many sections where Scott's book had me laughing out-loud. Just remembering those parts makes me smile, they were so funny. This book is well worth the expense. I see myself reading it over and over again."
1,News Article - Not an eBook,"This is a short news article with a very general description of a business that remodeled to increase business. Not an eBook, does not include any specific information. The article contains less information than the book description most listings display. Avoid this, especially at this price point."
4,Makes excellent espresso,"I'm generally a little leery of single beans for espresso, but this makes a really good shot with a nice crema and excellent flavor. Amzon had a sale on it a couple of months ago and I tried it and was pleasantly surprised, tastes similar to southern italian espresso. I use a pretty good machine and grinder but the shots are uniformly good and low acid. there are some chocolate overtones to the flavor. One of the nicer coffee's I have tried"
4,Good coffee,"This coffee has a good taste. It is strong, but that is what dark coffee is! Large size bag. Purchased through deal of the day and am satisfied with the product."
2,giving up on Hooper,"Although I enjoyed Hooper's much earlier works, this book made me throw in the towel on this author. What is this fascination she has with psychics? I find a bit of the paranormal fascinating, but in this book, as with her Hiding in Shadows, it's easier to count the characters who *aren't* psychic. It reduces the paranormal element from the intriguing to the ludricrous. Good heavens, with that many psychics working on the investigation, it'd be a miracle if it weren't solved!I enjoy a good suspense thriller with or without romance, so the gore didn't really put me off. The sheer contrivance of the plot did. She needs to reduce her characters by half, stick to one psychic and come up with a plot that relies on creativity rather than contrivance. That would be a service to her future readers. But this is one reader she's already lost."
1,Ugh,"I read the ""Shadows"" series and thought it was okay, though the paranormal isn't really my thing. This one, however, was unbearable. It's unnecessarily gory, and too many psychics spoil the plot.Definitely not worth the money, and definitely the last one of this author's books for me."
2,Porter Cable 7814,"I agree with the other reviewers, when this thing works it's the best shop vac I have owned. The first one I purchased from Amazon lasted two days and the auto trigger went out, thanks to Amazon they shipped another the next day, thanks again Amazon your great. In less than one year the secound vac's auto trigger stopped working, and after one weeks of using it without the auto feature the vac stopped working completely. I can not recommend this vac to anyone."
1,National Equirer meets High School Newspaper,"This is by far the most poorly written, poorly edited book I have ever read. I beg for someone to take it off my shelf and destroy it! The ""facts"" are largely inaccurate, it is nothing more than a series of synopses of Mel's films, interspersed with already widely published quotes from Mel himself. There are no insights into Mr. Gibson's craft, his approach to acting, in fact, nothing that can't be found on a 3 minute Entertainment Tonight fluff piece. Truly a waste of money. This is not an author with talent to spare."
5,A Must Buy CD!!,"This Enterprise CD is the most relaxing soundtrack you'll ever find. This is the type of CD I can fall asleep to, I actually did, in a good way though. The beginning songs are very upbeat and have very interesting rhythms. For those who watch the show two versions of ""Where My Heart Will Take Me"" are on this CD. This CD only includes songs from the pilot episode (""Broken Bow"") This CD is a must buy for any true Enterprise fan!Trip is the best!"
2,Huh!?!,"The previous reviewers have got to be kidding!!! The idea of having that over-the-top, over produced, overly commercial piece of rubbish as the theme for ANY Star Trek series, movie etc is just plain offensive. While the orchestral pieces are pleasant enough and in keeping with those glorious themes of the past, I just can't get past that [cruddy] theme song. It just does not fit a Star Trek series, no way, no how!!! The album loses 2 stars for daring to include it."
2,Enterpsie Score - Warps Away,"Dennis McCathy is a talented man. Extremely creative and vibrant in his scores.ENTERPRISE - has very few of these moments that Dennis created in Star Trek:The Next Generation.His theme for Seep Space Nine is the very best.Probably, because of the Pruducers, the ENTERPRISE SOundtrack leave much to be desired. Even ""Archers Theme"" needed to be expanded and used more brilliantly.Dennis you are good, but I was hoping for more from ENTERPRISE and I certainly wish you had created an original theme. But oh well, you must have tried.His best scores at Next Gen, DS9 and even the score fro GENERATIONS (Star Trek 7)- those are the ones to buy! Maybe next time Dennis."
3,Not what I expected but still pretty good,"The guns and the animals you get to shoot were cool but the characters were really corny, I thought it was going to be open hunting like the first game but it's level based and pretty linear but I had fun playing it and thats what counts"
5,A minimalistic review on the season that started it all.,"Fun season. Very nostalgic to watch, but noticeably very experimental. Very rough; trying to find its style. Like all Jack seasons, has its A, B, C episodes. Worst episode to date, in my opinion, was Jack VS Mad Jack. Good they got a lot of crap out of the way first. Still, must have if you're a fan of the show and a fan of animation. Period."
5,Samurai JACK dvd is finally out,"Samurai Jack is one of the best animated or non animated shows on television. Simply put, with all the action and adventure, the show is able to bring comedic instances into each episode. Its not fair to judge the box set, because it has not came out yet, but the show deserves recognition. Two shows that stand out are the ""three blind archers"" where the animators creativity really shines. As Jack blindfolds himself, you witness his senses gradually determine his surrounding environment as if he was able to see (daredevil). Or the ""robot ninja"" he fights in a tall building, jack becomes all white, while he nemesis is all black. Animated action in this show just sets the standard for american animation. This show does not provide alot of dialog, since it really does not need to. I stopped watching this show because cartoon network keeps changing the schedule/ or putting it on in ridiculous times. This is a great show and the dvd should also be something to have."
3,Not Hayley's best film,"This was probably not the best choice of movies for the extremely talented Ms. Mills. She deserves far better material.Still, the material is interesting. There are enough twists and turns in this movie to keep you watching.The only mistake that I feel they made is the dubbing of her singing voice. It just didn't sound even close to Ms Mills actual voice and was rather out of place in the film. The film was worth watching."
4,I'm pleased with my purchase.,The fabric is very soft. The throw is very light weight. It is not a thick as I expected. It is a good size for a lap blanket. The color is darker than I expected more like a burnt red. I found it listed for $8.99 on amazon.
3,Max McCoy cant wright a good Indy story,Before reading this read my review on Indiana Jones and the philosophers stone. I still dont think Max McCoy has seen the movies or maybe just 15 minutes of one. This Indy story was a little better but still quite boreing. Look for my review on Max McCoy's next Indy book Indiana Jones and the hollow earth
5,Thrilling Page-Turner,"""The King of Lies"" is an exceptionally well-written crime mystery. Hart keeps the pages turning (out of the early Grisham mold) while writing with a thoughtful literary style. Certainly beats the socks off of all these cardboard cutout ghost-written novels on the shelves these days.Can't wait to read his next effort... as I'm sure this is just the beginning of a great new career."
2,Lots of potential but . . .,"This book looked like it would be another terrific read in a genre that's one of my favorites. But half-way through, I realized that I wasn't enjoying it. Here are some of the reasons this book didn't click for me: (1) cardboard characters (the passive narrator, his shrew social-climbing wife, his emotionally fragile sister, her angry lesbian lover, and a detective with a chip on her shoulder); (2) the overly-dramatic writing style (the self-absorbed narration attributes deep meaning to so many mundane acts and events that after awhile I wanted to scream ""Enough!"") (3) way too many plot-contrivances (e.g., people walking in on each other just at the right moment to witness something important). It's a pity because the author shows some real promise in certain passages, but the overall effect is too leaden and plodding. I wish him better on his next outing."
1,"Tedious, annoying - a waste of time","This novel was entirely unsatisfying. The main character is so unsympathetic that I was rooting for his demise, the female characters are dismally one-dimensional (""Stay away from my husband, you white trash whore!"" Seriously?), and the killer is evident to anyone who has read Scott Turow. I wish I'd saved my money on this one - or at least bought it in hard copy, so I could have had the satisfaction of tossing it away."
4,"""Dallas"" meets ""All in the Family""","Unlike other reviewers I don't really like to rehash the books storyline, rather I like to understand more of the subtext or my reaction to the storyline. I felt that the author may have piled on the tragedy a bit thick in this family plot as just about every one of the seven deadly sins make a showing in this story.The wounded son, our story's hero somehow personally evolves beyond his father's domination and is ultimately able to deal with many of the family secrets. The Southern small town privacy within the family unit and the abused family secrets further direct much of the characters actions in this Peyton Place.The dysfunction of this family was tragic and the impact upon the family members profound with an ending that provided redemption for the survivors. It would have been interesting to have the book explore in greater depth the process of our hero's evolution.I recommend this read."
3,Bible Purschased,Would like to be able to look at different books of the bible at different times; cannot do this with this version. Would like to find a version that you can skip to different books of the bible without so much scrolling around to find what you are looking for. More hands on friendly.....
3,Kindle Version,"This review is for the Kindle edition of this bible. I like the concept of this bible. I don't feel it is that hard to navigate, but I do see how improvements can be made. After having this bible for a while now I feel I must comment on the errors in text that are in this Kindle edition. Whoever put out this bible needs to correct, then make available to all Kindle purchasers, the corrected edition. I know with Kindle editions there tend to me some errors in text but I feel there are far too many in this bible and corrections need to be made. Luke 11 is a good example of what I am saying. I have had updated editions of other books purchased for Kindle made available and I hope at some point they will correct the mistakes in this one and make it available to those of us who purchased it. Again, the bible itself is wonderful, but it has too many errors in text!"
3,packaging could have been better,"I purchased this item as a gift. It is exactly what I expected and it was shipped/received very quickly, but it wasn't in any type of protective case so the paper back was bent and slightly damaged. I wouldn't mind so much if it wasn't going to be given as a gift :/"
1,Boring.,"I remember the original Cannoball race. I had hoped the book would contain some of the funnier moments from that one and all the subsequent ones. But instead it is mostly boring and disappointing, I think Brock Yates has lost his sense of humor. I went about a 1/3 into the book and put it down as it was getting painful to continue. I'd give it away but dont' know anyone that I dislike that much."
4,I enjoyed the book and think it was well written.,"This book affords us a look into the priveledged family life of pre-Castro Cuba, . I was very interested in the family life of Cristina, and her inter personal relationships with her friends Gloria Estefan and Don Francisco.The book is a must for anyone who admires these entertainers."
1,I wish I could give it 0 stars....,what a big piece of trash! This Book should be place among the worst Books of all time-it's completely Inane and the Author is egocentrical and arrogant as usual.
5,Super Mario Bros started a video game revolution!,"Everybody should try this game and feel a joy for jumping with Mario. There are eight different levels, which contains four stages. If you are a real power player, you won't need warps at all. Koopa turtles, man-eating flowers and lukitus which flies with clouds are your enemies. Don't jump in canyons and beware lava paths! Grow up with a magic musroom and beat koopas with fire balls. Collect 100 golden coins if you want to get one life more. Attention, Super Mario Bros is not a easy game if you are beginner because there are lot of difficult levels in castles under water and clouds. This game can be cause a little addiction to playing. It takes so long that you beat the final boss whose name is Bowser. Melodies are simple but workable. It is easy to play with Mario because you can control him totally.Play and enjoy a long trip with Mario1"
1,lets get someting straight.,"This game is so so but the thing that kills it completely is the horrible, stupid controls. Mario seems to have greese on his boots as he always slides of edges and makes crappy jumps to his death no matter what you do. The graphics were pretty good for the time and the game is some what fun for about a half hour before it gets too repeditive to the point where you never want to see it again. Mario 3 is the best one. This game only sold so many copies because it was shipped out with every NES system. Nintendo Entertainment System saved the gaming market not this crappy game."
1,Wrong CD,I am very angry because the CD inside the case does not belongs to what I bought. I have tried to contact seller to no avail. I would like either a refund or the right CD. Is there anyone to help me. I don't even know where can I return it.Fanny Litovich
2,Just one Song,"The songs are just routine, with a little bit forced melodies. Arrangements OK but a little bit cheesy. ""Ride"" is the only song that stands.It's not possible compares with Cherry Twister, Tories, Drownies, etc."
4,An good book for an overview,I've always wanted to know what I was seeing when I went to the beach - especially when I began to bring a microscope with me. This book is a good start for people who are curious about the environment around them and want to put names to what they see.
2,Horrible Shower Curtain!,"I ordered this set based on the photos, which don't show the shower curtain detail. I won't be using the shower curtain, because the dolphins on it are totally deformed!! The rest of the set is ok, but its not as good of a deal now that I still have to purchase a shower curtain."
1,We are cross-cultural BUT>>>>,"We are a cross-cultural family with a rich background in many cultures. One thing that bugs me is historical inaccuracy. This book is lunacy. Depict a mixed family, YEAH!!! Depict a mixed family that is historically wrong - very confusing. Mary was not black, any more than she was white. The story of the manger is historical fact that took place in a specific region of the world with a specific genetic heritage. Don't mess with perfection. Great idea for broadening views.... that went very awry. Sad."
1,Disappointed!,"I've been a big fan of George Romero for years & have seen the majority of his films. Unfortunately, this is one I wish I hadn't seen. Some of Romero's more recent movies (Diary of the Dead & Land of the Dead) were a little silly, but I ended up enjoying them just the same. I gave Survival of the Dead a fair shot, but I just couldn't get into it. The story seemed flimsy to me, and the characters were predictable. The acting was a bit off at times as well. Do yourself a favor and take the reviews on this movie seriously. I wish I had."
1,Worst Romero Movie - Ever.,"I am a die hard Romero fan. So, when George has something new I buy it without even thinking. Unfortunately, ""Survival of The Dead"" is so bad I won't even give it a second viewing. It's like his creative seed has dried up and blown away. Mr. Romero, I apologize for saying that. There were elements in this movie of the continuing human and zombie social evolution but it was watered away in a poor script with a weirdly composed dynamic that just didn't work. I'm going to stop writing now as all it would be is more trashing of this movie. I will buy Mr. Romero's next movie as I am a die hard Romero fan."
1,Survival of garbage,"If I watched this movie 20 years ago, I would have thought it a decent zombie flick. But after the releases of films such as ""I am Legend"" and ""ZombieLand"", I can only say that this movie is garbage. The storyline is simple enough to be gleaned from amazon's product description. The dialogue is horrible, on par with that of an after-school play. The acting is bad, the action scenes look so fake. To give an example of the stupidity of this movie, there is a scene where a zombie takes a bite from the side of a healthy, full-size adult horse. The horse proceeds to lie down for other zombies to eat it. Try biting a horse sometime and see what the horse does to you. A scared adult horse can run over or kick over lots of people before it tires and collapses.Overall, a crappy movie and a waste of your time to watch it."
3,Expected more....,"I started this book with great expectations; however,I soon realized my expectations weren't going to materialize. Akiko was the only interesting character in the book and there wasn't enough of her to make this book better.My friends call me a voracious reader and I refuse to give up on any book; however, after less than 100 pages, I found myself bored and struggling to finish."
5,Super Awesome,"Contra was such a great game in arcades. Heck, it got ported to NES. The NES version gained more popularity, however. Heck again! It has a sequel!Super C is what you expect from the Contra series. You can do everything that you can do in the original Contra. Shoot in all directions, with several different power-ups to find, and bad guys to shoot the ever-loving heck out of!It seems like a direct sequel, but who would ever want to mess with the already perfect Contra formula?The music, though, is more fantastic than the first game's music! Not only does it have really cool beats and stuff, but there's also a kind of beat that you can't hear from any other NES game!The only problem is that it's too hard. The first Contra was hard, but then there was the Contra Code. It gave you 30 lives. The Contra Code only unlocks a sound test in this game. Not bad, but not good when you're struggling through a level."
2,"Lovely illustrations, but oh the writing is terrible!","My son insisted on us reading this book to him constantly when he was younger because he liked the poetry and the pictures, but it was (and continues to be) my least favorite book of his. If it hadn't been a gift it never would have made it into our library! The illustrations are really nice and colorful, but it is way too long for what it is and the writing is just sappy and awful. Besides that, it uses some vocabulary that is way beyond the intended age group and an innuendo that might make some parents snicker, but I was just annoyed that it was in a children's book. Skip this one!"
1,Cruel Method,"This book has a lot of good qualities-- well organized, clearly written, discusses medical causes of poor eating, says not to verbally pressure to eat, and not to use bribes to eat. That's why I was all the more shocked and appalled when I realized what the author's basic recommendation is -- use hunger to force children to eat. The child gets a large portion of a favored food and small portions of other foods. The portion of the favored food should NOT be large enough to satisfy the child's hunger. They get seconds only if they eat everything on their plate. So, if the child won't eat foods that they don't want to eat, they leave the table hungry!"
4,"Very 'country' and very 'cottage' look, perfect book if this is your taste!",Beautiful pictures and lots of styles for a more traditional and conservative look for your kitchen. This book would fit your needs perfectly if you like practical & cottage-style kitchens.
4,Second best of the series.,"If you can get past the fact that Christopher Walken's character, Gabriel was killed when Lucifer removed his heart and ate it, in the first movie, but Gabriel is still doing his thing in this one, you will find this enjoyable, but not quite the equal of the first. The reason is twofold. First, the plot is neither as complex nor as interesting as the first, being simply of ""A"" has to get to a certain place to win over ""B"" or bad things will happen. and second, this movie was done on an embarrassingly low budget. Fortunately, this movie does not refer to anything that happened in the second movie, so there is no need to see that before this one."
1,mario,I ordered the mario bros game on Sept 4th and still haven't received it ! I have e-mailed theangryguitarplayer' and have not heard from him! I would not recommend purchasing anything from him!
2,I don't like this game,"This game is my least favorite mario game of them all.It has bad graphics, especially on the NES, but even on the SNES on Super Mario All Stars, this game just sucks. the music sucks. the levels suck. the only thing good that might come out of this game is the different ""forms"" or mario.P.S. If you haven't already, but Super Mario Brothers 2 for the NES because that game i a lot better, but beware, on the GBA that game has annoying voices added on it, play the NES one."
1,Don't buy for pre-teens,"Bought this for the Wii. I have played it with my 2 pre-teen kids. You have to clear some preliminary levels to get to the boss. If you then die enough times before killing the boss, you have to do the preliminary levels all over again. I watch my kids get so frustrated when they have to redo the same levels over and over and over again. It is not fun for them nor is it fun for us to watch. I have removed this game from the house. Buy a Lego Wii game. Much more fun and forgiving."
1,Perhaps the worst of the Super Mario Trilogy.,"The only reason I keep this game with my collection is because I like to show off that I have every Mario trilogy game. For one thing, the fact of going around on a 2-dimensional level screen does not entertain me. There is no real action, has clunky game play, and has almost impossible challenges. Try it from a friend or connection first, just to see your opinion."
4,i love this game,the game did have some writing on it but it didnt matter. The game plays just like i remember it
5,totally tubular!,Galahad was amazing. It kept me guessing until the end! Galahad is a ship with 251 teens on it. A comets tail passed through earth and all the adults are dying. Galahad was built to transport teens to a new planet so they could start a new race of humans. Triana will have to bring the teens together to stop a major threat aboard the ship. Galahad was and still is breathtaking!
2,Very Average to Me,considering all the Hype He has gotten thus far I had to listen to His Album&wasn't that Impressed.this Lead-Off Single is ok at best.Vocally He shows me not to much.He is a Decent Instrumentalist but His Lyrics&Singing don't really show me much yet.this song is easily the lead single here.
4,GarminC330 Great Product,"The Garmin C330 is very easy to use right ot of the box. You can update software easily online. It is accurate 99% of the time. Only downfall is when you try to find Hotels, restaurants, gas stations, etc.. Many times accuracy fails unless you have the exact address. For the money, we are extremely happy with the purchase. We purchased for our daughter attending school out of state, gives us confidence and feeling of safety as she navigates unfamiliar areas."
5,Very functional and accurate,"I bought the Garmin Street pilot c330 for my vacation. We went to Mount Rushmore, Black Hills, Beartooth Highway, Montana, Yellowstone, WY and North Dakota. I was amazed by the accuracy and ease of use. There never was a spot where it didn't work.It had pre loaded points of interests and it located all tourism places, gas stations and hotels, lodges. My first time using a GPS and I will never go on a vacation without one. Total peace of mind."
4,Blunt and basic,"This GPS is incredibly simple, and basic. Yet for you money it is an excellent option. You get the holder and the car plug in. With updated info, this device works almost exactly the same as higher end gps. Only one voice option, comes with an auto dimmer, and can track your speed. You can't play music and your indicator is perpetually an arrow. But most people don't use these to play music and for $100 less than the higher end GPS's I can live with being an arrow on the screen. O.o"
1,Maps are old,"Bought this model two weeks ago. On my first out of town trip, 30 miles of one US highway and 15 miles of another state highway opened last year were completely missing from the screen. Don't depend on this for your sole source of information and don't try to call Garmin for help. They don't answer their phone."
3,Good Buy For First Time Users,"This is my first GPS unit and found this to be a good first time user purchase. Every thing on this unit worked great - finding places was fast and easy. I like the feature where it finds local shops, parking, restuarants, gas stations...etc. The only 2 problems I had with this unit was #1 I work in a high rise building. The unit does not find a signal until you are out in the open. Usually it will take me 5-10 min of driving before the unit finds a signal. #2 the suction cup glass mount does not work. I've tried everything to keep the suction cup to stick to the glass. It drops the unit after being 'stuck' for 10 min. Try using the dash mount."
4,The only problem with is you have no one to blame for getting lost anymore!,"I have been using this since its first release and it is great. I will upgrade as soon as one with a 17"" screen comes out however."
3,It's Great! when it works. . .,"I have this unit and it performed so amazingly that I gave one as a gift. However after only 6 months the unit will not acquire the satellites. After resetting as instructed by the on-line support, it seemed to perk up but it didn't last very long. It is on its way back for repair under warranty. I am sadly disappointed, because it has become an invaluable travel aid not only for me, but for my direction-challenged wife. She wanted me to buy another GPS while this one is in the shop!"
5,Great little tool,"Garmin StreetPilot c330 Vehicle GPS NavigatorA great buy. Guided me to and from LA. Then helped thru a mze of freeways in Houston as well as San Antonio. Finally spent time going thru Alabama. I never got lost, every destination found,took some of the suggestions for restaurants.Question - any one know where I can get my unit updated so I can use it in UK & Europe ???"
2,"Everything great, but got lost on first time out","Everything everyone is saying about the unit's positives are true. Worked right out of the boc, great screen, small size. A great unit. BUT, it got me ""lost"" on the first time out. I asked it to get me to the Tangers Outlet Center in Riverhead, NY, fully knowing how to get there. It brough me to a spot in the middle of nowhere about 5 miles away, and insisted that I was in the outlet center. I could not figure out a way to have it get me to the right place. I'm lucky that it was a test run and I knew how to get where I was going. But I returned the unit as a GPS that gets you lost really fails the very function it is designed for."
5,Excellent tool,"This Garmin navigator is by far the best I have tried. Although not perfect (none is), the c330 performs very well and it is lightning fast in recalculating the route when you take a detour for whatever reason. I have learned, by trying the roads I am familiar with, that the c330 doesnt always chooses the shortest or fastest route, but rather the main roads. However, it will always take you to your destination. All I hope now is that when the time comes to update it doesn't cost an arm and a leg, because it will surely need update soon, as I already found that some recently built roads are not in the memory chip."
4,Good unit,Garmin makes great gps units. I also have the Street pilot 340...better than the 330 in that it tells you the street names. But over all the 330 is a very good unit.... recommend this company for sure.
5,Awsome GPS,"Very good combination of price vs performance. I'm still finding quicker routes to places I've beed driving to for years. It even worked in an airliner on a recent trip I took from Orlando to San Francisco. It then showed the way on a five day driving trip through the Napa and Sonoma valley region. This unit is so easy to use, I hand the unit to my friends, tell them it has a touch screen, show them how to turn it on, and I have yet to find someone that can't operate it in 15 seconds. I just love it!"
4,YEAH! LOVE IT!!!,"I can't live with out this thing. I had the Garmin 2720 prior to this and it is pretty amazing. The C330 lacks a couple things like saying out loud the street name. But, truly it's not that hard to read the screen! I recommend this product with out a doubt!"
1,No Workie,"Well, apparently I was one of the unlucky ones. Turned it on only to get the ""Can't unlock maps."" Sounds like they need to recall this thing and get it working properly."
1,very disappointing,"Garmin StreetPilot c330 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorI have had a new Garmin c330 for 6 weeks. I have found many errors and outdated maps in the system. Some restaurants and other businesses that it locates have been out of business for at least 3 years. One recent error directs me to a non-existent street over a concrete retaining wall. There has not been a street at that location in over 50 years. Another problem is that it doesn't even show streets built in the last three years in newer housing developments.The Garmin web site provides supposedly newer maps :( for a PRICE. The upgraded maps have the same errors and omissions that the original maps have. Garmin doesn't want this piece of junk back, and I can understand why! My next gps will be a Tom-Tom."
4,Great!,"I literally do not leave home without it. Better than the 'built-in' kind, can take it in any vehicle. Some problems with the Boston area because of the big dig, but most of the time there are no issues. I wish it stated upcoming streets, but again, not a huge issue. For the price, it was definitely worth it!"
4,Great system for the price,"If I had one fault, it does not say the street names. Does not bother me because it announces your distance from the turns. It does not talk excessively, great product for the money, totally love it."
5,Garmin GPS C330,"I am very satisfied with the product and use it almost on a daily basis. The navigator takes you to an exact address or city and takes the stress out of searching for streets, addresses etc. Easy to use and comes pre-loaded with the maps that we use."
1,I'm sure I would've loved it...,"But, I'm forced to give it 1 star since the c330 didn't work out of the box. When I received the c330 after 10 days of waiting, all the maps were locked (upon switching the unit on, the message ""Can't Unlock Maps"" appears) and the unit has to now be returned to the Garmin factory to make it work.This is a huge inconvenience and I won't buy Garmin products again. The unit looked and felt great and seemed easy to use, but it just didn't work for me."
5,Never leave home without it...,This product is ready to go right out of the box! I've had it for 3 months now and I love it! It's worth every penny!
4,Awesome Unit,"This little thing has been a lifesaver. It has been accurate. The only downside is when new roads open up and changes in roads happen, the unit is not accurate."
5,Florida Trip,"Amazing tool for navigation, no maps or mapquest needed ever again. Does lose satellite signal on rare occasions in Florida, but you can restore operation by moving it to an adjacent car window. I have had no trouble in other states yet tho. It will operate by internal battery power about 2 hours so you can take it in a friends car or anywhere else you go."
4,Garmin's GPS is a Great Gadget!,Super easy to use and program with addresses. You just have to be careful because sometimes the shortest route is not the fastest. It also does not account for traffic. I would recommend this item.
3,Some screen scratches and not all items received as stated in description,"The product description states the following are included ""Vehicle suction cup mount with integrated power cable, USB cable, USB drivers disk, Dashboard disk, Quick reference guide"" - however, I did not receive any of these items. Heads up - I also ordered an additional power cable for car charger because I didn't think it came with one ...well it did and so I spent money I didn't need to spend but have no suction mount or user guide, etc."
4,Very Good PS,"I own two GPS units, the NUVI and the C330. If you want a very good, out of the box product, at an affordable price, buy the C330. Sure it has minor inconveniences in some of the trips it plots; however, for $400 this is a great practical unit. I use it everyday."
4,Good product!,"The timing is very good, I never miss a turning when using this GPS, which is better than many others. The only problem I met is, the resolution is not high enough. For example, when I drive in downtown area where the streets are very close to each other, the GPS cannot find the right street name."
3,Garmin - sensible & convenient,"It is easy to install and simple to operate. If you miss directions, it recalculates directions quickly. We noticed however that it does not always show the shortest routes. Also, the vocal directions do not indicate street names. Overall, it is a great equipment at a good price."
3,Couldn't Find DHMC,"While this is an efficient, barebones GPS navigator, it's occasionally disappointing. Yesterday I went to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire. This is a huge major medical complex in the Northeast U.S. The Garmin didn't recognize the address, and there's no way to input the name of DHMC. Also, there's no way to add your present location, so I couldn't store it for future use.This navigator, however, so far works a bit better than the Tom Tom One that I returned after it led me astray once too often.There's no incentive to report errors and omissions in the mapping, since there's a steep fee to update the mapping information. You'd think they'd fix defects in their product without charging extra, when these things are expensive to begin with. Unless you have to have one (like I did for my business), I'd wait a year or two while the makers of these devices work out the bugs and fix their maps."
3,Garman GPS,The product works great but they could have erased the previous memory out of it so I didn't have all the BS that was from the previous users.
4,Love it!,"We have never used GPS in the past, and this is our first time using one. I am glad we followed advise from the reviews. Our Garmin is a hit, especially we are spending long hours on the road. Very easy to use, affordable and handy. We love it.."
4,Excellent,"Purchasing this item is A NO BRAINER. It is absolutely wonderful. It gets you where you want to go, whether via the local route or the main highway. If you dont need fancy bells and whistles, this is the only navigational system you will ever need. Some places had old addresses, but if you type in their new addresses it will take you there...which is all you need it to do anyhow! It is incredibly easy to use. Some people complained about its brightness... not an issue, it is perfect!"
5,GPS,Excellent product. I am on the road a lot visitng clients. This helps not only getting to appointments but finding places nearby such as restaurants.
5,Garmin GPS,I love it !!!! I am very happy with this GPS and use it frequently . I think it is an excellent price for what you get . It is very easy to use .
3,NEEDS UPDATED MAPS,PRETTY GOOD GPS GOT ME TO FLA AND SC SAVED ME TIME BUT MAPS NEED UPGRADE/ CALLED GARMIN AND THEY TOLD ME MODEL IS OUTDATED THATS WHY ITS SELLING FOR SUCH A LOW PRICE
4,Great 1-st Wave Ska Album,"If your in to 1-st wave ska... or just want to retrace SKA's hisroty... this is a great albu... especially my favorite song on the albumn ""skinhead girl"""
2,Mostly self-righteous and moralistic quotes.,There are about 1400 quotes in the book from dozens of moral philosophers throughout the ages. I particularly enjoyed quotes by Marcus Aurelius and Henry David Thoreau. Perhaps 50 quotes appealed to me while the rest seemed mentally arrogant and morally condescending. I'm a fan of Vernon Howard because he does have some enlightenment level quotes of his own in other books. I find him to be hit-or-miss since he hasn't let go of earlier psychological developmental levels. He can be judgmental one minute and unconditionally loving the next.
1,The real Safety-Kleen story,"This book was actually commissioned by Safety-Kleen Corporation in honor of themselves. Leather bound copies were handed out like awards to customers, directors, employees, and others. Safety-Kleen indeed experienced a remarkable growth history often admired by Wall Street and financial writers everywhere. The truth be told, Safety-Kleen never had 'recycling' as their corporate mission until they discovered they could no longer 'get rid' of the used solvents their customers were generating. Considerable ""Superfund"" liability supports the fact that SK disposed of a lot of contaminated solvents anyway they could.... including landfilling. Readers may also find of interest, ""Naked with the CEO'S Daughter: Corporate Environmental & Personal Ethics in Question"" by T.D.Herod. Available here."
4,incubus is too cool for words!!,"i am an alternative rock fan and i really enjoyed this cd. i heard the songs 'drive' and 'stellar' on the radio and LOVED them. this cd did not disappoint me. i think the battleship scralatchica is cool and the song make yourself is not bad either. the other songs are okey-dokey, not too good, not too bad. overall a very enjoyable cd and great for car rides with your friends. fully recommended though not for little kids cause it has swear words in it"
5,Incubus is weird in good way,"The first album I got by Incubus was Morning Veiw. I liked it even though there were a few songs that didn't meet my criteria in terms of Hard rocking. Half a year later, I bought Make Yourself(A GREAT ALBUM) and thought ""These songs are more hard rocking than Morning View(WHICH IS STILL A GREAT ALBUM). So if you like hard rock with (still) a soft touch, Make Yourself would be a great CD 2 buy. (the best song is ""BATTELSTAR SCRALATCHTICA"", an instrumental that foucuses completely on DJs!"
4,"Worth buying, especially if you like Primus",My son told me this album would be worth listening to and he was right. I saw it in my favorite used record store and snatched it up. I'm glad that I did. They're kind of like Primus but better (IMHO).
2,Big Disapointment,"I was turned on to ""SCIENCE"" about a year ago, and was blown away. It had an incredible sound that has yet to grow old with me. ""Make Yourself"" sounds like another band! It reminds me of early 90's grunge metal. Battlestar Scralatchtica, which is the only song reminicent in the spirit of ""SCIENCE"", is probally the best music on the CD. Boyd's singing on this CD is in a consistant state of wishy-washy emotion. Infact, the entire CD is wishy-washy. I would recomend this CD for the ladies, and guys who may have just been dumped by their girlfriends."
5,It's worth it!,"I am not a big Incubus fan. But one day I watched TRL and saw the video ""Stellar"", and it was a great rock video. A few weeks later I purchased the CD and realized all the songs were cool. And that's when I became an Incubus fan. The songs ""Privilege, ""Consequence, ""Stellar"" and a lot more are awsome. The others are also really great, but I do not want to name them all right now. Incubus proves that they have much tallent, and are a great rock band. Incubus is one of my favorite rock bands since I've seen the video Stellar and have put a lot of work into this album and do deserve some credit. The band does have a lot of tallent and made a really cool music video. Incubus is my third-favorite rock band and is also creative. If you bought this recording and you are a rock fan, is it worth it? Awsome rock CD! Great for parties also! Buy it!"
5,One of the top five albums of 1999,"I love this album! I got it right away as soon as I heard the single. The single is great and so is the rest of the album. The way they mix rap, rock, alturnative, and funk is awsome! Brandon Boyd is a great singer. I love his voice."
2,Kinda Dissapointing,I reallly thought this album would kick major a$$ but no i thought wrong this is the worst album that they have released yet. I was so dissapointed after listening to this album that i almost brought it back to the music store where i bought it don't waste your money and make a mistake by bying this album if you want a great Incubus album get SCIENCE it rules and it's wayyy heavier
4,If you dig SCIENCE then this is for you,"A great album with many creative sounds in it. With just one listen you can tell they've grown as a band. Like I said, if you like any of their other work then you must check this one out"
5,above the rest,"This is great! Only Incubus can come up with both amazing lyrics and beats. This album has some of the best lyrics i have ever heard. For example track number 5 ""When it comes"" the words are a masterpiece on explaining how he can not be sold. Back to the music part, the mixer is definately the best part of the band and proves it in track number 4 ""The Warmth"" I had to listen to that song 50 times before I was sick of hearing it. This is a great cd and the only thing that can match it is Morning View or A Crow Left of the Murder.If you dislike it I can not see how it is as creative as I have heard and as original as Rage Against the Machine's E"
2,I don't know what happened to Incubus,"To be frank, i was quite disappointed with the new Incubus. It's not as bass induced and it surely isn't as heavy. Maybe I need to give it a few more listens to feel what they're doing on the new record. It sounds like the band's sound is maturing, but thing is that the sound isn't as interesting as the last record. The vocals are stale and the music though innovative isn't very exciting at all. I hate to say it, but the new record just doesn't add up to what I'm sure fans are hoping for..."
3,Borrow it first,"This is a very long-winded album. I'd suggest you borrow it first. The majority of the songs follow a verse-chorus-verse formula in almost the same fashion. I've had this cd for a week and still have trouble telling the songs apart.IF you've heard ""Pardon Me"", you've heard the whole album"
2,Mediocre,"This cd is listenable but nothing special. I really like Pardon me but none of the other songs catch my attention. He doesn't have a bad voice but he should stop trying to rap, it doesn't sound good. I guess if you really want to buy this cd, get it used."
2,ENJOY not owning this album...,"Ughhh! I have to agree with some of the reviews below, this album is weak! For any other alternative band this would be a decent album, but for Incubus, this is simply a collection of 3 minute, radio-friendly songs that the record company pushed them into doing. Apparently, this constitutes ""maturing"" to some. There are some great moments here, but they are few and far between. There is very little diversity here compared to their previous efforts. And what's up with ""I Miss You""! Come on! If you're going to sing a song like that, try and do it in an original manner...not played out Celine Dion lyrics over an Everlast chord progression! Buy S.C.I.E.N.C.E.!"
3,I miss you,"1999 the first time I heard of incubus thanks to drive, and I miss you it such a sweet song. The more I listen to this album the more I like it!"
2,"Good, but Incubus can do (and has done) WAAAAY better","I've never understood why a group capable of great things, is willing to be satisifed by utter mediocrity. Make Yourself is a great album for some group...but not for Incubus. For Incubus, it's a weak offering, not nearly coming close to what we know they're capable of. The songs are slow, and lacking the frantic energy of SCIENCE. I've heard it called ""mature"". Frankly, I'm offended that mature apparently equals slow and repetitive. Do yourself a favor. ""Make Yourself"" buy SCIENCE. You'll thank me."
2,New album not what it should be,Being a huge fan of incubus for some time now i am not that happy with how this album sounds.S.C.I.E.N.C.E was and is was of the best albums ive ever heard. But with this album the tried to come out with a new sound and now they just sound like a horrible faith no more rip of band.I hope this was just a fluke and this doesnt show what there albums in the future will sound like.
5,"Melodic, funky, heavy, soulful, and insightful","This is one of the best albums I have heard in 1999...Incubus is not the Deftones or Korn. Rather they are truly the most creative group on the planet. From the blistering opener ""Priviledge"" to the heart wrenching ""I miss You"" this album is everything you could ever want...If you like this call your local radio station and request ""Pardon Me."" Bands like this need your help...Korn and Limp Bizkit have made it. Help out the up and comers-Incubus, Kilgore, Staind, SlipKnot, System Of A Down...these people need your help."
4,"A strong, dynamic showing from the ?best? genre-benders. . .","Incubus is back after a two year hiatus with Make Yourself - an excellent example of what this young band is capable of. While the songs aren't as playful as some of their earlier material (anything off Enjoy Incubus, for example) - they certainly show off a cohesiveness not many bands posess.Some high tracks include the first single, ""Pardon Me"" & the beautiful ""Drive"".Incubus always has provided sharp social commentary and this album is no different. A definite must-buy for anyone who appreciates a great mix of progressive/funk/trip-hop/rock/fusion . . .Four stars!"
1,Perfect for a brainless young teen girl,"Incubus was a band with lots of potential. Their first album S.C.I.E.N.C.E had enough original elements to stand out in a crowded music market. It was a good listen fun, wierd, smart, & it rocked.I was rather horrified before Make Yourself came out to see Brandon Boyd on a teenage girl magazine. I knew the band was dead from that moment. Brandon has a great voice and sure can sing and I knew they'd go pop. Incubus released this album which sounds like N'sync playing their own instruments. I understand why Brandon chose this route. His bank account is now flush with cash. But he killed the potential this band had. Now this band is another has been act that had a few top 40 hits and is waiting for their 5 minutes on VH1's Where are they Now. If you like real music don't get this album. If you are a young teen girl and want to dream of a cute boy get this album. It will fit perfectly next to N'sync or Britney in your collection."
1,terrible!,the songs are absolutely horrible! the songs are very peaceful. the old band was better! the vocals are bad...not like 'em!
4,Not Bad @all,".@ first the 4 stars will seem generous and u will think more in the region of 2.5 stars but u really need to give if a few listens through before you judge it This album is quite hard to get into, you have to really give it a chance. It is a classy album, but one thing which really cheezed my bugle about this CD is the fact that Incubus feel the need to add downright stupid sound effects in the majority of their songs.Without these and a few other minor glitches such as mediocre lyrics, this album would be overall pretty damn good......but nobody's perfect, are they?"
3,"It's Okay, glad I bought it.","If you like Incubus, you have to have this cd. I like incubus but I only really like four songs from this album."
5,One of the best cds I have heard in a long time,"This cd is incredibly brilliant and refreshing. In a world full of Brittany Spears and O-town, it is amazing to hear such powerful lyrics and music that actually say something and are trying to convey an honest message. It totally surprised me to hear music like this that has a harder edge have such amazing and poignant lyrics. Incubus is truly a revolutionary band...along the same lines as Rage Against the Machine..fighting for something they believe in and expressing themselves truly. Brandon Boyd has an incredible voice and the rest of the band are masters at what they do. They are inspiration in the truest form."
1,Am I missing something ?????,"This ad clearly shows FRONT AND REAR window guards.... I sent my 1st order back after opening up a HUGE box and getting only REAR window guards... Thinking it MUST be a mistake and looking over this ad again to see if it mentions ""Rear Windows Only"" and NOT seeing that, I Re-ordered these window guards.. Well, I just got another HUGE BOX with only REAR window guards again !!!AM I MISSING SOMETHING ???? Has anyone ordered this set, clearly showing front and rear, only to receive rear guards only ???? otherwise, the rear guards fit well!"
5,Snaps for Dorothy Corey!,"This is an amazing book for young children, to educate them about leaving. Almost every child is afraid at some point that their parents won't come back for them when they go away, and this is the perfect book to help deal with it! I especially love the wonderful illustrations and the simple words that make the book perfect for young children. It is also very good at portraying various races instead of just caucasians like many of America's picture books. An all-around good book!"
2,Not Indiana Jones Worthy Author,"The book could be alright if it wasn't an Indiana Jones Book. I have read all 12 Indy novels, and the two by Caidin were brutal. They have nothing to do with Indiana Jones' charachter or the plots from the other books. I reccomend the Indy novels by MacGregor and McCoy, but don't bother with these one's, it will ruin it for you."
2,Dangerous advice,"I just hope people are smart enough to realize that half of his advice is good, and half of it will probably kill you, and are wise enough to tell the difference."
1,Turned Me on To Rock and Metal,"I was probably 13 when I was given this book at church. It actually became a handbook, of bands to check out. I got into heavy metal and hard rock from reading this book....not probably what the author had in mind, but even back then, I knew it was a bunch of hooey. Heck I may buy it again LOL."
1,Hilarious! Fantastic bathroom literature!,I've heard about this book for years and recently inherited a copy. Can remember when it was being distributed to and by the churches where I grew up in the 70's. The author lives in a fantasy world accentuated by his own dementia! I'm only vaguely familiar with many of the groups mentioned within yet can recognize dozens of outright errors. Even sadder is that someone on Amazon is trying to sell it for over $100. Never pay more than $2 for it unless you can steal it...
4,Too Much Fluff,The fundamentals disk is great the rest of it is just junk. The pets CD is a demo with no educational value at all. The music and art CD are lack luster and devoid of value. Might as well let your kids play Nintendo. I would recommend this program just for the fundamentals CD it tricks the little darlings into practicing there skills by making it fun. Learning through play. YeaH! I would just chuck the other three disks in the trash.
1,"Oily, almost meaty taste","I've tried several other blends of Cafe Altura coffee and been very satisfied (Current fav. is breakfast blend). This order, I decided to try something different, and I regret it. The New Orleans Blend is intesely dark and oily. It almost tastes meaty. If you like really dark, nearly burnt coffes, this might be your blend. If you're just looking for a mellow easy-drinking morning cup of joe, this one probably isn't for you."
5,GREAT TOOL,"This thing is really great, it,s so accurate its mind boggling. I bought a pencil just for this, and then realized I should have read the fine print. I had gotten the wrong size and had to go back to get the right one. If anyone needs to borrow a pencil I have a few spares."
5,AN EXCELLENT TEASER- IT LEAVES YOU WANTING A NEW ALBUM,ALICE IN CHAINS HAS CLEARLY STOOD THE TEST OF TIME- THEIR SOUND HAS REMAINED THE SAME (UNLIKE PEARL JAM OR STP FOR EXAMPLE). THIS ALBUM DEFINITELY BELONGS IN ANY FANS AIC COLLECTION
5,Darkest of the era,"From the beginig Alice in Chains was unique because the were way under the radar sceen compared to Nirvanna and Pearl Jam.Layne Staley was dark and lost in the world of addiction. This cd covers the brief but amazing career of a very talented band that never really recieved all the recognition they deserved.They were heavy and the were melodic. The voice was haunting and the music was dynamic. Through it Staly sang of his fight with demons (i.e..""down in a hole"", ""would"", ""what the hell have I"").After his death we all learned the impact that Alice in chains really had on music.This cd is really good. It covers alot of awesome music. If you are a fan try this one. Its better than most greatest hits cds you will see."
5,let's hope they get born again,"Wouldn't it be great that Layne would get his health underaway and this band can pump out some more hits like man in the box, rooster, and heaven beside you?"
5,One Of The Best Hits Cds Ever,"This is a wonderful cd for an alice in chains fan. The live version of rooster is my favorite track on the album,and the new song get born again is also a great song.Every song on this album is great especially live rooster.Alice in Chains is a very good live band.Any fan has to buy this cd."
1,Columbia Records is one greedy company.,"No artists in their right minds would try to rip fans off like this. It has to be because of contract obligation. Nothing Safe merely repackages their hits, adds a couple songs available on bootleg and import, and tacks on a lacking new radio song... and all this is supposed to prelude a box-set that will apherently contain the same songs! NS merit's one star for Get Born Again (an OK song that doesn't show a lot of effort, to be completely honest) but over all, this is not an album. I doubt Alice will ever release a real album ever again. This, my dear sheep, is a corporate force-feed."
4,A fun hockey game,Wayne Gretzky hockey overall is a good game.The graphics could be better but it is still a great game.One of the best hockey games for the N64.
5,SO GOOD!,"LOVE IT! There so addictive, and well worth the price. Great characters, storylines, dialogue, illustrations...everything!"
3,Still nothing new,This master guitar player is still having difficulty creating brand new melodies. He has been reprocessing his beautiful old melodies in his recent CDs.
2,"Boring, no more originality","I love Armik's first 3-4 CD's and than he ran out of the new ideas. This CD, like the last 3, has no hook song they all sound the same to me. Great musician, let other composers to help you to write a new, exiting staff. Armik needs more variaty of songs."
1,Worst Paradise Lost CD ever!,"It was bad enough when Britain's gothic doom metal masters sold out and started doing that lame Depeche Mode like dance music but what's with this stuff? My farts make better music, dreadful. What a shame a once great band has to lower themselves to this."
2,The metal is too soft,"I bought the Woody when it first came out in 1997. It worked well, and I enjoyed the unique nail pulling feature. Unfortunately, the claw was rapidly filled with nicks from pulling nails, and the waffle face that initially looked very cool was pounded totally smooth in the first two months of use. Stainless steel is too soft for a hammer. I put this tool away when one of the claws finally broke off using it for demolition. I keep telling myself I will send it back to Hart for a refund, but don't have the time. For the money, the hammer should have lasted as long as my reliable California framer from the same company."
1,broken handle,"I'm a union carpenter I do a variety of carpentry anything from framing walls to setting concrete forms. I'm always looking for a good universal hammer so I don't have to have a tool box full of different types of hammers. I bought a Hart Woody when they first came out this stainless steel hammer was awesome, however,the head kept comming loose so I sent it back and it was replaced with this new style Woody. This new hammer is a cheaply made imitation for the some rediculious price ... I say this because I broke a claw off the first week I used it. I took it back got it replaced. Two weeks later I was pulling nails and shatered the handle because the stifback steel broke.Personally I don't think it's worth the investment."
1,why discarded this item,"I discarded this item because of the combination between the company name (dead on) and the company logo (skull and bones). It shouts ""DEATH"" all over.... may be I'd pay more attention if the company's name would be ""Live on"" :-)"
2,Not so much........,"I bought this game for my 5 year old son. We played it together the day it came, and never again since. It was a fun game, but he has zero desire to play it again. He gives no real reason why he doesn't like it. I thought it was cute & fun."
4,THIS is what music needs!,"I have not heard of Dios until I went into a record store and heard them playing it over the speakers. I bought it and i love it. It sounds like a mixture of 4 excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent bands: Flaming Lips, Radiohead, Beatles, and The Beach Boys. This CD is breath of fresh air. I'm glad good music is still coming out, instead of looking at yesteryear. Dios should be proud this is their first album, b/c it is awesome. Keep it up!!"
4,A good bass for your money,If you really like the ernie ball basses but dont have enough money the JBPs are a cheap alternative. They are good beginner and intermediate basses that sound close to the same as the real thing. Their are a few small differences but the main differance is the name brand. JBP basses are great for what you spend.
2,not a good book,"A book full of mistakes,and not at all a Chaplin biography.Just the opinion of the author about Charlie the tramp and his background.In brief,a study of the little tramp from the point of view of the author.I think he didn't see a Chaplin film,all his reviews are mistaken or invented.The best are the photos.Avoid this book."
2,Would not Buy it again,"Nothing Special, disapointed with the distance the phone reaches. You better stay in the same room as the transmitter. After two rooms over, you will get static that makes it almost impossible to use. The answering machine I would rate a 4, it's good and simple to use. The Phone a 1. My 900 HZ, $14.99 cordless phone was a lot better then this."
1,Static is terrible,"I have this same phone set along with an extra phone. I bought it in a store and not Amazon. I was on Amazon to buy a new phone and saw this one, so I wanted to post a warning. This is the worst phone ever!I have a small house and the phone has static in everyroom, even if you are beside the set. Do not buy this phone. You cannot hear over the static which comes everytime you move your head or walk at all."
1,"""How to make sure you never see your grandchild""","As the daughter-in-law of one of those entitled, obnoxious, overbearing grandparents, I encourage everyone to stay far away from this book. Following this ""advice"" will most likely alienate your children and lead to you being removed from your grandchildren's lives-with good reason."
1,Horrible,I give this book zero stars. It is more a guide on how to be a jerk and drive a wedge between a daughter/in law and mother/in law. Very disrespectful to a family unit.
1,Really?!,"This has to the most disgusting thing I have ever seen. How about you get a hobby? Grandchildren are a privilege, not a right."
1,Don't Get This Book If You Care About Your GC,"The rules in this book are a sure-fire way to never get to see your Grandchildren again. If you love your grandkids and want to spend time with them, a good rule of thumb is to be respectful of the rules and boundaries set by the parents and to establish a trustworthy relationship with them. Breaking that trust by lying to get what you want is not an action that can be taken back. It is forever broken."
4,Only 3D available before Christmas,"I am glad that the seller emphasized that this was a 3D version as other sellers did not, and I would have been disappointed if I just got the 2D. The only problem was not the fault of the seller but the postal service in delaying receipt of the movie."
2,Limited Resources,"When my daughter decided to get married in Southern Vermont, we were concerned about finding the resources we would need to plan a wedding outside our home area, but The Vermont Wedding Resource Guide promised to solve that problem. When the book arrived, it was difficult in some cases to tell where vendors were located (the town names were not always on the map provided), but eventually we figured out that most of the resources listed were for the Champlain and Burlington regions and the Manchester area (where our wedding is taking place) was sorely neglected. Also, the guide failed to provide the editorial information that would have helped us to find the vendors who fit the theme and tone of our wedding. This is not a guide, but a very limited ""yellow pages"" of resources."
1,worst penny I ever spent,"I paid 1 cent and shipping for this little thing and still got screwed! Unbelievable, This thing broke the first time I opened it! The most important thing I want to say in this review is concerning the fact that I know a lot of dads who get a tiny knife like this for their sons first pocket knife. I mean smaller is safer....right? Certainly not in this case, I flipped this knife open and-I think it must have been lose , because the screw that holds the blade in place was bent not broken-the flipped right out of the knife. If I had flipped it up instead of down it could easily have hit me in the face,eye,etc. Don't buy this knife!"
2,Pretty but flawed....,"We loved the design, the pink is very pretty & the earbuds look cute. However, we ended up replacing the earbuds immediately. Additionally, it skips ALOT. It starts itself over midsong, and eats batteries like candy. I would skip this and find a more reputable one in pink."
4,Making Leather Hanadbags and Other Stylish Accessories,This book has a lot of cool ideas. The best part is that they give an excellent discription and pictures of all the tools you will use! This has been helpful not only for the handbag styles they show you how to make but in making my own ideas come alive!
5,Excellent Tool,"Have used Inca Tools for years, this is a great bargain, buy the video too if you haven't used a inca jig before."
5,Incra UltraLite Jig,Extremely satisfied with the jig. It works just as the product description promised. The instructions are clear. This jig has brought my router work up to a new level.
4,Very Exciting!,"I just finished phase one. The first day was the hardest and I had horrible migranes but every day after my energy levels were through the roof! My skin is clearer and softer and I'm not tired! Oh, and total, I have lost 8 lbs! 4 were water weight but I lost 4 during phase 1 and an inch off my waist. I don't normally do diets because they are unhealthy, but this system isn't like most diets because you can eat a lot of food and you don't have to worry about counting calories cause you are eating all healthy foods. There really isn't much reading to this book which I like as well. It's short, simple, inexpensive and to the point."
3,more like health tips to get you started,"This book is alright, but not much of an actual diet to follow. There are a handful of recipes so you have to get creative on your own. In the first phase you can't eat cheese, but one of his recipes for phase 1 calls for cheese, so there are some definite errors. It did definitely inspire me to eat lots of healthy foods and over the past few years since I bought it I lost 50 pounds and kept it off, but it takes a lot of motivation and exercise too. This is a good book for tips and inspiration but it was written quickly and without much thought or editing."
2,Diet Book,"I have about 10 pounds I'd like to lose. When I have time the tread mill works great. I also don't eat fast food or anything fried. So, I figured I'd see that this diet was all about. You basically send your body into shock with nothing but fruits and veggies for a week and then control your portions over a three month period. If you don't have kids then it would work. The portions don't work with a family. I suggest using common sense when eating and exercise. You also won't get hit with emails everyday about diet and exercise either!!!"
5,"Updated Reports, Please!",Okay all you Fat Smashers. Let's see how you did in the LONG RUN.Can you give me some info. on Phase 1????? What are some of your tricks? Did you reach your goal???? Have you kept off the weight?Thanks!
5,Smashed Fat,"Dr. Ian,My wife and I would like to thank you for writing ""The Fat Smash Diet"" book. We followed your program and with in the first ten days my wife lost 9lbs. and I lost 10lbs. with out feeling hungry. Over the next couple of weeks I had lost an additional 12lbs. and my wife 7lbs. We were both surprised to have co-workers notice the weight loss and more than happy to tell them how we did it. My only regret was not taking the before pictures you had recommended.Thanks again for your program,Andrew"
1,The Fat Smash Diet: The Last Diet You'll Ever Need,I did not like this book at all and I would not recommend purchasing it. You are better off purchasing a cookbook that offers healthy eating recipes instead of this book.
2,Extreme Dieting,"This is good if you're looking to lose a few pounds quick, but I was hungry constantly and sleepy. Within 36 hours my clothes were getting loose, but I would not recommend this to anyone looking for long term. His methods are so extreme you can't even have a cup of coffee. Like I said though, it works for losing a few pounds at the last minute, but other than that, I am sticking with sensible eating and my work outs for now."
3,Just common sense,"If you don't mind eating only vegetables and fruits for 9 days then you may do ok with this book. No bread, no coffee, no sugar, no soda, in the initial detox period. Very hard to do. Filled with a lot of info most people already know, eat healthy and excercise."
3,The Fat Smash Diet,"If you've read one diet book, you've read them all. I was expecting something new and revolutionary. It was disappointing to say the least. No need to add this one to your collection."
5,Excellent book,"It's a very simple, easy to follow ""diet""!!! Once you decide to follow thru as listed you will see results!!! =D"
5,MY LIFE HAS CHANGED!!,I heard Dr. Smith on the radio talking about his new diet book. At first I thought it was just another book with another angle to lose weight. But it was so inexpensive and the reviews were so good that I decided to try it anyway. Boy am I glad that I did. Four weeks later I'm down 20 pounds and I haven't even felt like I've been on a diet. Other programs cause you to restrict what you eat and after a while you get tired of eating those bland foods. But Dr. Smith's program is completely different. You eat till your full and you eat tasty regular foods that you normally eat.The other thing I liked was the recipes. They are tasty and so easy to cook. I have cooked almost half of them now and they are so easy and inexpensive to make. This is not a diet at all. This is a way of living. I will eat like this forever. I am now a SMASHER!
1,Fat Smash Diet Okay,"Didn't really like this book. I browsed through and thought it needed more color and perhaps some pictures to get me through all the reading. I really like Ian Smith's advice on television, but this book made me want to yawn and not go to the gym."
1,Not the video in the picture,"The video I received wasINCRA LS Positioner Instructional DVDby Incra. I don't think it was a mistake, because the part number on the DVD case matched the part # here VDOV1.Well, you get this with the LS positioner free, no need to order this if you have the LS, and no reason to order this if you don't, so.........."
5,Zinger,"A great,honest story that rally goes behind the news media fluff an describes this Christian man's battle with cancer. And his friends that stood with him."
2,Promising start that only fills in the odd crack!,"The Race is written by James Schefter who (after reading the introduction) was one of the frontline reporters of NASA's manned spaceflight program from the mid 1960's. Given that information I assumed that I would learn a lot about what happened behind the scenes in Gemini-Apollo era, rather than the history text book story. And it certainly starts off that way. A great deal of detail goes into the pre-NASA days, the rise of Werner Von Braun, Bob Gilruth and the soviet Chief Designer. A few interesting stories such as the time Neil Armstrong slept in for the first X-15 flight and the tension between Chris Kraft and Scott Carpenter fill in some of the gaps, but I'm left feeling that given the author, a lot more could have been said. This book isn't in the same league as Andrew Chaikin's 'A Man on the Moon'. Only for the dedicated space cadet!"
1,Disappointed,Being an Electrian I have used different stud finders . This one scans to deep in regular mode and tell you there are blocks and studs where there are none.
1,Unreliable piece of...,"If you want to reliably be able to locate studs, go with another stud finder. If you want a great party game--'hey, who can get the same reading twice?'--get this stud finder.It ...."
1,DOA,"purchased at store and detector showed AC detected all the time, even when away from power lines. Perhaps DOA."
5,Don't Tread On Me,"I live in a dorm with guys from the south, so I needed something to back me up, being from the north. This flag is not only freakin sweet, but it has the tying in of the Culpeper Minute Men from Boston. New England!!"
5,Craziest book ever,"I can not recall ever having read a crazier book. I can't believe the praise on the back of the book, from what you assume are learned people. It's sad that books like these even exist. But it sure is a conversation starter."
5,A wonderful biography,"This is one of my favorite books. The details and life of the court of Henry VIII are masterfully recreated in this book. Lady Jane was the grand neice of Henry VIII, and was third in line to the throne. The heads of states illegally pronounced her queen on the death of her cousin, Edward VI, and eventually she paid with her life after ruling only 9 days. This book takes place from the time Jane is a young girl, through her life at court with Henry and his sixth wife Catherine Parr, to her execution in 1553, when she was only 17 years old. I highly reccomend this book. The reading level is not too difficult, as it is with some historical biographies. I managed to read it in grade 8 with no problems. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I have."
3,Only volume 1 deserves 5 stars,"I have this combo pack SE(=vol1+2) + vol3 and DVD. Volume 1 is want gets this book 5 stars. vol2 and vol3 don't give you this ""aha erlebnis"" that vol 1 is giving. Vol 2 and 3 are just good books (3 stars) on music and guitar. The DVD does not add much to the book, it is good to have a look at the DVD so you know in 1 hour what the book will try to teach you.In vol1 you get a realy good (super) explanation of the fretboard and this book will teach you how the learn the secrets of fretboard and not ask you to memorize 100 scales and chords. This is indeed a must read for anyone starting on guitar."
3,Not for the Beginner,"This book teaches you five basic chord shapes then instantly throws barre chords into the mix that you MUST LEARN in order to follow the rest of the lesson plan. Barre chords are something that are nearly impossible physically for some students, they are introduced into most lesson plans at the 'intermediate' level, and they are not required to get started on the guitar.These books (and the horribly produced video) are great for someone that has some guitar under their belt and wants to take it to the next level (improvised jams over chord progressions etc...) but for someone like myself that's just starting out and would like to play some recognizable music, learn a few blues licks etc..., this series just doesn't fit the bill."
1,A Truly Terrible Book,"The author of this book claims to be a Godzilla fan but spends the entire book insulting the movies and then rejoicing in how bad they are. He only seems to like the movies because they are bad. The only good information in the book is quoted from other (much better) books on Godzilla. Large sections of the book are pointless musing that wastes the reader's time. You can tell the book is bad because he constantly talks about the American hack jobs of the Godzilla movies and never talks about the subtitled, faithful versions. Avoid this book."
3,Nice Try by One of the Best Ever,"In his early years with King Crimson and ELP, up until the late 70s, and his couple solo albums in the early 80s, Greg Lake's voice was among the very best in the music business; however, of late, it seems age (and maybe his smoking habit) has caught up with him, and it shows on this live CD recorded during his 2005 tour and released in 2007.Anyone hoping for some super-inspired, awesome production will, unfortunately, find less than that from this effort by Greg Lake. The original productions of the songs selected for the CD were each better than the mixes in this collection. And, though Greg's voice sounds better than it did for the ELP Black Moon days when it was quite raspy, his voice is deeper (with a limited range) and somewhat flat, also, the songs sound like they are in a key a tad bit lower than the originals.Buy it for sentimental reasons and for the sake that Greg has not come out with any new material in many years."
4,Be sure to understand what you are getting,"Whether you find this book worth the money will depend on whether you think Ben Hogan was the God of Golf (or at least one member of the Trinity). It is a large-format book, and the quality of the photographs (all black-and white) is excellent. I believe they were all taken on the same day, when Hogan allowed Jules Alexander to accompany him. They pretty much just show Hogan at work on the course, and they do capture who he was. The accompanying comments and essays are interesting, but the photographs are the stars of the book. Just make sure you realize that you are getting a series of photographs taken on one day -- this isn't a retrospective of Hogan's career, and there are no swing sequences or anything like that. If you are a Hogan worshipper, however, this book is a must."
5,A Touchstone Recording,"This disc contains nearly 80 minutes of greatness. Two of Mozart's greatest piano concertos, a lesser known early opus, and this re-mastered material from the DG archives sounds better than yesterday! Those who know Kempff as a great interpreter of Beethoven will love his lyrical and supple playing on this recording. With so many choices in this reportoire, this would be a great place to start, and as always with DG 'Originals', the price is right. A terrific recording for Mozart lovers, seasoned and new."
3,No drawer stops? WTF!,This is the same product I bought 5 years ago...but now you are providing it without the drawer stops...so that the drawers slide all the way through. WTF? They are just cheap ass little plastic stops...but they are invaluable to the use of the product and I cant buy them anywhere. So now I am stuck with a product that still functions...but not well like it should/could. How cheap of you folks!
2,Easy but not a good fit for baby,"Although this stroller is lightweight and super easy to fold up and throw over my shoulder/in the car, etc...my son does not sit in it comfortably. The crotch strap doesn't adjust in, so he's always slumping down in the seat and his head is at a weird angle. He fusses every time he's in it unless I recline the seat all the way. He's 10 months old and in the 100th percentile for height, so he's certainly not too small for it! It's so bad that I want to buy a different lightweight stroller but can't seem to do it since I paid so much for this one!!"
5,Excellent stretch,"I have now done this workout twice and find it really good. The stretches are very effective, Karen's voice is pleasant to listen to, the music is relaxing and the vista of Montana in the background is lovely. You will need a yoga strap and block to get the most out of the workout."
1,Cracked after second use,"Got the 2.6 Qt tagine for Christmas and it cracked after the second use. It was being used on a ceramic cooktop and the setting was medium low at all times. Very very disappointed in the lack of durability, especially for an expensive item like this. Emails to the company have gone unanswered. Will never buy the Emile Henry brand again."
1,Jack the Ripper meets Agatha Christie!,"Jack the Ripper meets Agatha Christie's Then There Were None in chapters alternating with tediously written psychological treatises on Satanism and the occult. This is a yawner that I couldn't recommend to anybody. Is there anything at all that Slade didn't attempt to throw into this preposterous salad from the bar - epilepsy, child abuse, kidnapping, silly technology, rabid dogs, Mounties, guillotines, wheelchair killers? Pure silliness and only dogged determination got me through this one!Paul Weiss"
5,Don't understand the other reviews,"Maybe there was a redesign? Maybe some people never go to Ikea? Anyway, I had no problem putting it together - everything fit exactly as shown in the instructions. Ours replaced an endtable in the living room and looks fine in the corner. I too, noticed no smell. Yes, the wicker has a polyethylene (plastic) look/feel, but it still looks remarkably better than the small plastic kennel that sat in the living room before this purchase."
4,Good action film. Well-acted by good ensemble cast.,"This is a well-acted movie on the same Robin Hood theme. However, the always interesting to watch and listen to George Macready and that superb character actor, Paul Cavanaugh make it worth watching. John Derek and Diana Lynn are mediocre, but the movie never stops moving so interest is sustained. Not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, but worth seeing for its entertainment value."
2,Christmas with Houston Person and Etta Jones,"The title of the CD suggests that Houston Person and Etta Jones play Christmas music together. They do on one track. Two tracks feature neither Houston Person nor Etta Jones. Etta Jones is simply awful on both the Christmas Song and on White Christmas. Her intonations are in poor taste and they are awkward attempts of being different. If it is true that you know an artist by how he or she treats a tune we all know, well, here is proof of what Etta Jones stands for."
1,undersized and overpriced,"This was a TERRIBLE purchase on my part. It doesn't even deserve 1 star. I just wanted a small bag to wear over the shoulder for quick access to my z7590 without holding other equipment or being too bulky. The bag was too small for my z7590, and I paid $8 shipping PLUS return shipping. I only hope they don't charge me a re-stocking fee. I went to WalMart, found a cute little bag in the electronics dept. that the camera fits great in, with room for the strap AND extra memory cards or battery if necessary. They have cute ones for ladies too, with pink polka dots or stripes inside! For only $12. Next time, I'll be smarter!"
4,nice case for the Z7590,"Really like this camera case and would recommend it to others. The Kodak Z7590 is a ""chunky"" camera and I was not finding a good fit in a case that wasn't too bulky. The camera just fits in this Kodak Performance Series Case. The case is attractive and has a nice long adjustable strap, there is room in the top for a battery and spare memory. Smaller cameras will also fit nicely as there is a padded insert that I had to remove for the Z7590. Very nice product reasonably priced."
3,Kodak camera case fit,"I have the Kodak Z710 which is a bigger footprint than some of the other models they say fit this case. In order to fit the camera in the case you have to remove the padding. Therefore, it's a case but it's NOT padded for that model or ones that size.It does work and it keeps the camera dry in rainy conditions."
5,Great Case!,"I just received my case today. It fits my Z740 perfectly and holds the battery and memory cards perfectly too! Maybe the reviewer that said they didn't fit received a defective one. It's a very nice looking case. I, like one of the other reviewers, almost didn't buy this after reading the negative reviews. I'm sure glad I took the chance. If you need a case for you Z740 this is the one you want."
3,Too small,"Very nice leather case, unfortunately I couldn't get my camera in it. So I rerured it, I wish I could have gotten another one that fit my camera."
2,carrying case,"NOT A HAPPY CAMPER!!!CAMERA FITS FINE IN IT BUT WILL OPEN UP,THE LATCH NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE STRONGER.I PAID MUCH MORE FOR THE CASE THEN LISTED HERE.STRAP ON IT CANNOT BE MADE LONGER,VERY DISSAPOINTED.I HAVE MS AND DON'T LIKE TO HAVE IT ON MY SHOULDER,WHEN I DO IT CONSTANTLY FALLS OFF!!I LOVE KODAK PRODUCTS BUT NOT THIS ONE.HOPE I WAS HELPFUL,THANK YOU,SUE SIMON"
4,Protect your camera,After spending some money on my Kodak Z710 I was looking for a case to protect my investment and this was a really nice option. Is just what can be expected.
4,"Replaces the original, but could use a longer electrical cord.","I installed this power window regulator in my 1995 Dodge pickup recently. When comparing it to the factory part, the only differences I noticed were that the main lifting gear is not as thick as the factory part and the electrical cord exits the motor at a different point and is therefore just barely long enough.The gear appears to be made of substantial steel, and I don't have any doubt that it will last as long as the factory part, in spite of being somewhat narrower.The electrical cord was a stretch to reach the factory connector, and the plug, which mated with the factory wiring, did not have the original Dodge rubber seal. If the cord had not been long enough, it's easy to remove the factory wiring from its mounting point so it will reach, but that leaves the connector dangling inside the door, which would rattle, I assume.All in all, this seems to be a perfectly serviceable replacement for the power window regulator."
3,still unsatisfied.,"This book is interesting, but many questions remain unanswered. In this kind of affairs, the number of protagonists, places and sub-affairs -the whole surrounded by a thick haze of secrecy and deceit- gives a headache...and is somehow frightening...but in the same time I think we feel unsatisfied. We'd like to go farther and deeper. Is it a kind of addiction ?"
2,Not a strong fantasy novel...,"This book showed some promise in the beggining. It didn't come true.Arien Mirida thinks he's cursed. His bride was killed by beasts gathered by an ancient curse he didn't know about at the time (and later his aunt managed to tell him about). So Arien decided he'll live unhappily ever after - until he discovers hope exists.Enter Cat Sabledrake. She falls inlove with Arien and helps him destroy the curse. Then she helps him resurrect his bride, and they part, unhappy again.So what's the catch?!I liked this book until I realized it was setting the course for a whole series, with Cat Sabledrake as main character. Well, I for one, won't read the rest of them. The one I liked, Arien, won't be re-appearing, so why follow all Cat's bad choices of lovers?! If it's true love, let it be free... at least in a fantasy novel, love should be true.Not in this one, though. Not to the end."
3,for completists. you know who you are.,"If you already have all of the Chip and Carrie duets and 'Last Chance"", than this is a bargain. Grab it, it's got two good songs. Get the other ones first though; they're way better than this, which is for fans only."
3,Just the Facts and Little More,"The Korean War is a very interesting time period for the military aviation enthusiast. It was a period where propeller driven P-51's and Corsairs battled with Mig 15's and Sabre aces shot down Yak 9's. And of course, the huge jet battles that took place over the skies of Mig Alley. A technological revolution took place during the four years of the conflict.""Korean War Aces"" by Robert Dorr is a plodding account of Korean Air War. All the key phases of the war are covered. Dorr dutifully documents all of the key facts. Every ace gets his due. However, if you are interested in the human story of Korean Air War, this is not the book for you. It is a pity that such dramatic story is rendered in such lifeless manner. The only reason to purchase the book is for the photographs and the color aircraft plates."
5,Wonderful Scent and Inexpensive,"I just adore this fragrance, made with citrus and cloves instead of weird chemicals. The scent just raises your mood by its very bracing clarity. I sure hope they never raise the price because I love that it is inexpensive too."
3,Delivery hole at top of bottle wastefully too big,"Smells good, but I do resent manufacturer/bottler making the hole at the top of the bottle way too large to cause more fluid to come out than typically desired by the ordinary consumer. Obviously, it was deliberate company decision to cause product to get used quicker even as it frustrated the user, in the US commercial corporate tradition of sacrificing consumer interests in the pursuit of ever increasing profit. With some effort I was able to cut off the tip of a retractable ball point pen and glue it upside down into the large hole to solve the problem. Thankfully there's Amazon's opportunity for consumers to sound off at anti-people policies with customer reviews."
2,It wasn't that great,"This book started out okay but by the time I was half way through it I was wishing it would end. There were too many characters and the time travelling was just confusing. When I got to the end of Novel I was so thoroughly confused that the only thing I could say about this book was that I wasn't very good. I've read a whole bunch of other books by Diana Wynne JOnes and they were all alot better than this one. So instead of buying this one go look at the Dalemark Quartet, The chrestomanci series and Archers Goon."
1,Same fault on cord at 10 pin connector after two purchases.,"I have purchased two of these units now and both went faulty on the first day. The 10 pin connector was slightly loose on both units, you could actually rock them slightly, when they were attached to the camera they would work at first but stopped mid way through a shoot, pressing lightly on them to ensure the connection was inserted into the camera correctly would get me a shot off, but then it would stop working again. I replaced the unit to find exactly the same fault and on the same day.This has left me wondering if the unit had been repaired and re-sold, maybe I would have better luck purchasing direct from Nikon? It does seem strange considering my mc 30 remote release which was purchased from Nikon has only just stopped working after 4 years of use but that was because It ended up in sea water after a rogue wave caught me off guard while shooting along the coast.Anyone else suffered the same fault I described above?"
1,A poor recording.,"The high pitch, off key, of this recording, nearly made it painful to listen to it and the CDs are no longer in my collection."
5,Fledermaus Flies!,"All too often, Die Fledermaus is trivialized like many operettas and is therefore performed with less vocal mastery and devotion than it deserves. This recording is the precise opposite of that statement. From the first bars of the overture to the rousing finale, this Fledermaus sparkles brightly. Lucia Popp is the most amazing Adele that one could hope for, executing her aria about being on the stage with a dazzling coloratura. It is unusual to have a baritone cast as von Eisenstein, however, if anyone can pull it off, Hermann Prey is the man for the job. He gives a jovial air of Vienna to the entire work which is truly charming. Ivan Rebroff's Prinz Orlovsky is thoroughly silly, as is appropriate, and much more satisfying that having it played as a pants role. The chorus numbers are boisterous, and the dances (including a knockout ""Donner und Blitz"" polka) will make you get up from even your most comfortable armchair."
4,Thrilling - albeit with problems,"Yes, there are all sorts of problems with set. Kleiber is often on overdrive which pays off brilliantly at times and becomes wearying at others, Prey and Kollo not quite in top form, and Rebroff is a disaster. But listen to Lucia Popp sing the first bars of ""Mein Herr Marquis"" and all complaints are washed away. Popp and Varady and often Kleiber just make this recording indispensible for all its faults."
2,I need a recount,"Recently purchased this tool. Don't get me wrong, it a heavy, well built tool. I'm having trouble supplying enough air to operate it. My compressor is a 5 hp, 26 gallon Campbell Hausfeld ""extreme duty"" capable of delivering 6.8 scfm at 90 psi. I figured this would be enough compressor to operate any air tool sold through your local home center. Guess I was wrong."
5,Awesome Note Sheet,This is a great product for anyone who has brain freeze out in the field and you didn't bring your Canon How To Bible with you. You can go to the chart and figure most of your questions out with this cheatsheet. Well worth it.
5,Worked within 24hours!,"Effective and will recommend to others! Safe around pets, and even after using , have enough left should problem recur"
5,It works! :),"After seeing ants in my apartment (partly due to my own negligence in leaving out open foods/drinks), I bought this in an attempt to kill the colony. After laying down the traps next to the ants' trail around the perimeter of my kitchen, they quickly gathered at the newly set baits.After 48 hours, I don't see any more ants. It's been 3 weeks and still no ants, so I imagine this product works. The queen is in all likelihood dead. Yay!"
5,no ants came back for seconds,"I set just one of these packets out where I had ants coming in from under a baseboard. Within an hour, they were swarming all over it like a fat man convention at an all-you-can-eat. I had even gotten some on my hands and then rubbed it off on the wall and they were swarming all over that area too. By the next day, the flow of ants had practically stopped. I figured it was just the bait had been emptied, so I set out another one. No ants came back for seconds. Highly recommend."
1,"did not work for me. ants take it, but reappear after a day everytime.","this is the first time the ants actually line up to take the bait, ill give it that much, but thats where the success stops. the ants line up and take the bait for a couple of days at a time. i see a break for about a day, and then theyre back as if nothing ever happened. this has happened 4 times in the same spot and ive gone through about 8 of these already. its just not working. maybe the ants i have are immune to whatever this has in it.as a last resort, i think im gonna buy some chinese ant chalk on ebay. i hear that stuff is full proof. too bad its illegal..."
1,Taking too long,"I had high hopes for this product cuz of all the postive reviews but it did not work as well as i thought it would. The ants did come, a LOT of them, and they were there for two days and even on the third day there were still many of them walking around although not as many as the first two days. I began to lose impatient although i still left the trap there...so on the forth day, there were STILL ants coming. I don't understand! I thought they'd be all gone by then but there were always a few of them walking near the area, taking their sweet time... I finally decided to move the trap on the fifth day. And there were STILL some ants lingering around afterwards. Driving me nuts!!!!!!!!"
5,"Too much fun, wish they would come back","After many unrelenting battles against the ant invaders with inferior products, I finally splurged on the Terro pre-filled kits.I used to enjoy watching a few ants die here and there with the Raid products and the like, now, I get to see an ant picnic for one afternoon, followed up by a short term drunken ant party. Next day, they're all dead and gone. Short lived fun for me, the sadist in me wishes I had a satellite colony so I can continue my vendetta against these beasts!If it were prudent to do so, I would remove a star simply because they're too effective and ruin my fun."
5,It kills ants. What more do you want?,"We live in the middle of the woods so learning to share your home with all sort of critters is just part of life. However, this spring for some reason, we were practically invaded by carpenter ants. I put up with it for about three weeks before ordering a couple of these 2nd day air. The traps were like a magnet, pulling ants out of the woodwork. Four days later--not a single one in sight. Case closed."
1,two weeks later I still have ants!,"well, I rushed to the store after the reviews here and praises of terro from my friend. long story short: it didn't work for me. two weeks later, maybe three, and we still have ants. the bait is still crawling with them, they still forage all over the counters and there doesn't seem to be an end in sight. i refreshed the bait every day or two, but it seemed to just encourage them to keep coming. two queens even came to sample the bait stations, which I squashed, but the ants don't stop. it's possible they would eventually, but i'm ready to try a different product...onto combat. wish me luck!"
3,"Just put them out, will see","I put out all six pre-filled liquid ant baits in my kitchen about three hours ago, hoping to get rid of the what seems to be hundreds of small, reddish-brown sugar ants. At first, the baits I placed directly in their newest trail seemed to attract them. They were stopping and going into the plastic container. But, after about an hour and many ants getting stuck and dying on the inside, the ants seem to be walking by and ignoring the trap. But another trap that I placed in my cabinet where I kept my sugar, peanut butter, ect., seems to have a steady stream of ants coming and going. I'm really hoping this works, since I have all my food from my cabinets out on my island in my kitchen. Will update."
1,"doesn't work, just bring more ants to the room","I read the reviews and hope it will work after 2 days. But now it is the 6th days, it just attract more ants from outside into the house and then they spread all over the room and didn't take the bait."
5,Incredible,A wonderful story that defines great literature. Ms. Little has captured real life in the 1800's with the hardships and heartaches of genuine characters. Her use of period language and phrasing makes this a 'Steinbeck' type read. The two women in this novel are captivating and realistic. I can't say enough about this story. I felt like I was there with them. I am now going on my 7th reading.
3,Entertaining western,"Pregnant Aidan Blackstone is sent west by her uncaring family. They want her to live with a distant cousin to save the family's reputation.When she arrives, she finds out that her cousin, the cousin's husband, and their children died of influenza. The only survivor is Joss, their daughter, who has been raised like a son.The novel shows the hardship of farm life in the 1870s.It's a good read with likable characters, but a few of the events in the plot seemed too construed and come out of nowhere. Still, it's entertaining for a few hours of reading."
2,dumb,"one of the worst movies ever. dont waste your time. i still cant believe i made it to the end. full of bad acting, stupid dialogue, and story glitches. just dumb. need to chew a dirty sock to rid my mouth of the taste."
2,gave up in the first 10 minutes,"Film did not hold my interest for very long. I think it is a waste of time.Been done much better in other ""end of the world"" films."
3,Just OK,"This tripod is well made and convenient in terms of size and use, but I feel that it doesn't really support my camera as well as I hoped. I have a D80 with the 18-135mm lens and it takes a little adjusting to have it positioned so that it won't topple or collapse (depending on how wide the legs are). I am keeping it, because when I do have it set up properly, it works fine. Also, I am sure that it will be more that adequate whe I use this with a camcorder or a smaller digital camera."
3,Plodding,"While I enjoy Anne Lamott's writing, I found this book rather tedious and repetitive. And the descriptions of the tennis matches are interminable. I mean, point by point by point! Not Lamott's best, but Rosie remains a wonderful character"
3,Teenaged tennis goddess,"There are some good things to say about this book. Lamott is consistently skilled in her use of language, and every once in a while she writes a sentence that is truly astonishing in its beauty and insight. She constructs a plot that deals nicely with dilemmas of honesty and presents it in a way that would make a great discussion starter for a group of adolescents. But the plot is otherwise strange: the scenes involving Luther, the obsessive man in the bleachers who offers tips on how to improve her game, are particularly unconvincing. It isn't a particularly ambitious novel, especially considering the trvial consequences she chooses for her main character. But it did leave me thinking: if I am someone who cheats, does that make me a cheater? Jean-Paul Sartre might disagree with the conclusions Lamott draws."
2,Lamott's weakest work,"As much as I appreciate Lamott's vivid, character driven fiction, I cannot recommend this book. The narrative lacks focus, the motivations of the characters, especially Elizabeth's, are not convincing -- it is not up to Lamott's standards. There is a character, a girl Rosie plays against in a major match, named Atterbury. I had not forgotten that Mr. Elizabeth's name is James Atterbury. Lamott apparently has. Not paying attention? Sloppy work, Annie. You should have lived with this one a little longer before you called it finished."
3,"Good writing, characters obsessed with own navels","Some find this overly descriptive, but I enjoyed the writing. There is some fine prose here, but is this really what Marin County is all about? As a sociological study of indulgent, privileged people who don't work, this is a fine portrait. I kept wanting to shake these people and tell them to get a life. Then I felt, maybe because I'm a man, I'm not getting something. Do women want to read about helpless women obsessed with their looks and their love life? At least the girls play tennis, which provides some relief from Rosie feeling sorry for herself and smacking herself with her fist to get sympathy. It made me weap for meaning in life. These people's lives have no meaning beyond their own narrow emotions which they can't escape. I would like to see the author turn to something with more meaningful!"
3,Snap out of it!,"I read ""Crooked Little Heart"" as part of my local bookclub selection. Although I found parts of it abruptly reminding me of my own tortured adolescence - I was shocked at the teenagers being described as sexy and somehow wise beyond their years. I know that some people are born with an innate ""carnal knowledge"" - but come on!! I found myself waiting for something horrible to happen, but the only thing that did was the adults tuning into their own teenage angst. This book could have had a better editor and been a nice slice of life genre, but I found that I was growing bored with the entire family and especially Elizabeth's fixation on herself. Lamott had several nice turn of phrases, some wonderful word pictures, but for me - it was an average read."
2,Disappointed,Thought it was based on the TV show. Don't particularly like the replacement characters.
1,First case defective,"I received the ADG Sports Silverside 3 pistol case to discover that no key was included for the locking latches. A quick call to ADG Sports customer support got a set of keys on the way. Then, upon closer inspection, I noticed that one of the hinges was not aligned properly and only 3 out of the 4 rivets were properly engaged. I filled out the paperwork to return it for exchange the same day I received it. We'll see if they can get it right the second time. If it were made in the USA instead of China, this probably wouldn't have happened"
2,Hope you like blue,"The bulbs emit a very blue light, and it's quite noticeable in the video. You'll never know when you done charging, I charged all night, and the red light was still on. With no instruction sheet to refer to I'm still in the dark. By the way I got two, both with the same issues, I would have sent both back but my wife threw out the packaging. I'm here now looking for better video light, I know can do better for the money spent."
2,More like christian themed orchastrations then prog!,"I bought this CD based on Mike Portnoy's praise of it on the Dream Theater Web site. What a mistake. This should ahve beened release on a christian label instead of Metal Blade.I have listened to it at least 20 times and I just cannot get into it. Very nice orchastrations (if you like that), but this is definitively not progressive rock! The lyrics are way to personnal for prog. Neil Morse should have written a autobiography book instead of recording is soul.Disc 1's got a few good moment at the start but then MOR songs are inserted between prog tracks. Disc 2 is all MOR.Morse is a great composer and musician (check out any previous Spock's Beard or Transatlantic release). This is evident here also but not in a progressive way. This set is multi-layered orchastrations molded around the christian lyrics. The music never leads the way.If you want progressive rock, DO NOT BUY this set."
3,Solidly sacrificed,"It's not the overtly Christian lyrics that eventually renders the stuffed double disc limp, but the exhaustive hymnal balladry and prog instrumental cliches which make this obviously personal triumph less than spectacular."
5,Dr. Jiro Horikoshi's Story of the Zero Fighter,"I have had the good fortune to be involved with various models of the Zero in the Pacific for over 20 years. I didn't realize there was an actual book published by Dr. Horikoshi concerning specifically the development of the Zero until recently. This book really answers questions about design features and requirements that were ahead of the times. Discussions concerning Japanese Navy requirements, weight minimums, compromises in performance and where the compromises was made up. The Dr.'s regression toward softer elevator control at higher speeds is one example of the simple yet brilliant engineering that went into the Zero, helping to make it the scourge that it was."
2,Inductive Reasoning Isn't for Me,"While some kids enjoy the challenge of finding out things for yourself, I am currently sitting through a 1 year hell of trying to grasp the concepts in this book. If you are representing a school looking for a new Geometry book, consider teaching this as an alternate class to a more traditional book. Patty paper constructions, sketches, and other things only help you out so far. Our teacher still has to go over most things with us."

4,This looks like one of the few bits with an accurate picture,"The radius of the cut is 3/8"". Note that this is a beading bit with a smaller bearing, not a rounding over bit!"
1,never again,"The antenna is very flimsy. It is attached to the unit with a very thin, weak, sliver of metal. Yes, it broke off soon after purchase (during a power outage). Alot of cranking for 30 min or so of radio operation. Radio reception was poor, forget shortwave."
5,"Broad, Simple, Easy!","Don't underestimate Mr. Kumar he does a masterful job at explaining complex arguments in simple understandable terms. This is a great tool for evangelism. If you are not quite sure how to answer those hard-nosed intellectual snobs, this book is a great starting point. Kumar deals with some of the most relevant objections of our time. How would you answer an Atheist? Can you really trust the Bible? Kumar deals with these questions and much more. The reason I gave this book a five star rating is because it maintains simplicity yet incorporates complexity!"
4,Phys. Rehab Lab Maual review,"Good information, not as challenging with technical reading as O'Sullivan's Physical Rehabilitation book, but informative. This is a textbook for the physical therapy assistant program I am in."
4,Not her best but better than most out there.,"I have read most of Kay Hooper and Kay Robbins books and this is one of her better ones. The plots twist and turn and keep me guessing to the end.Although the love story did not take center stage, it was just enough to call it a romance novel.Her writing styles have changed a little bit in this latest book. The scenes switch back and forth that is similar to seeing a movie.I am not sure if I like this or not but it certainly keep me from putting the book down!Her best book is still Dream Man."
3,"OK, but not great","These are OK, but not great. I prefer the Taste-T-Picks.Taste-T-Picks Natural Mint Flavored Toothpicks Twin Pack"
5,Great DVD,"Yes, this does what it says. I like the instruction and would suggest it for anyone wanting to pick up some great licks."
4,Terible Ted at his best!,"It has been a great while since I have heard some new Ted Nugent. And this CD is a Great releif from what my local radoi stations have been playing.All in all, I have to say that this CD kicks [...]! The effort is a lot better than the earlier works. Possibly because you get better at things as you go along.And Ted has definatly done a superb job with this CD. Better guitar riffs and an improvement in lyric writing."
5,Quality that is home made.,"I bought this ice-cream maker because I wanted to make homemade ice-cream without additives. The ice-cream is absolutely great! It is very easy to use and real easy to clean up. What a nice finish to a meal. The recipes I use make four servings. It is perfect for us but if a person wanted to make more, they can place the first batch in a freezer tray and make another batch. You put in the ingredients and turn it on. Presto, perfect ice-cream every time."
5,A sure thing!,"6 Stars. This is one of my favorite albums ever, period. Falling squarely between jazz and blues, this entire album just rips it up. Cleanhead is at the top of his game and the sax backup provided by Cannonball is spine-tingling (and the rest of the band is right there with them). You will assume they have been playing together for years, this whole thing is so tight. I'm on a Cleanhead crusade because nobody knows this guy and you hardly ever hear him on the radio, but he will blow you away. And when you buy this and love it, check out ""Kidney stew is fine"" or ""Meat's too high"", a more recent release (well, late 80's, before we lost him). Careful on the earlier stuff, though-it's a whole different sound, and Cleanhead sings a bit like Big Joe Turner (but if you're into that, you're set). You won't regret this........"
5,Healing for everyone,"Read this book and you'll discover that the healing techniques and sources of pain uncovered by the author apply to EVERYONE! This is an amazing resource for parents with SSA children, as well as anyone whose ever experienced pain, hurt, resentment...This book is a guideline for how to heal you and your family. As Mr. Cohen points out: Change is possible! This quick read goes hand-in-hand with Mr. Cohen's life-changing book Coming Out Straight. Both books provide excellent guidelines for hope and healing."
4,he got the point,looking at the 20th century as the ambient century is right on the spot. none the less the book focuses too much on individual artists and not enough on the general development and background.
2,More like a band recommendation list,"Really isn't anything beyond a list of records the author enjoys. Extremely noticable gaps in artist's careers (Focuses entirely on the ""ambience"" in Miles Davis' ""Miles Ahead"" and completely ignores the fusion years. Listen to Summertime and then listen to Yesternow. How is Summertime even remotely close to ambient?) and even completely lacking artists (If the Residents don't qualify for ""Eskimo"" but Jimi Hendrix does for ""Electric Ladyland"" then I've been grossly misinformed).Book has almost nothing to do with Ambient music as a genre and everything to do with the records the author enjoys. All Music Guide does just as well at explaining it and that's just plain sad. Interesting only for fairly good record recommendations to new fans, and perhaps those interested in production."
5,"Timely, relevant, and concise","I thought this book did what a ""how to"" book should do. It defined a problem and set forth effective solutions and strategies for dealing with it.Also, there were new twists on old ideas as well as some completely fresh material I had never read anywhere else, nor would I have thought of it on my own.I am more than pleased with my purchase. Highly recommend."
2,gehts so,super fast shipping and delivery excelente has only one week until the game came gedaurt the game was in top condition of mice. good sound but the game hangs up without even vorwahnung. not good graphic
1,Should be named Raising Your Defiant Teenager,"Although the book claims to be about ODD and the first chapter gives a good summery of ODD the book does not go on to talk about children who suffer from ODD. Instead, he talks about defiant, rebellious teenagers. All teenagers go through a phase of rebellion, some more then others. It does not mean that they have ODD. ODD is not a phase. It is not something that develops at the age of fifteen. It is something that a child is born with and struggles with from birth. This book is written for teenagers and relates very little with children. The strategies presented are ineffective for a truly ODD child - although they probably work great on a rebellious teenager. Save your money - don't buy this book."
4,A Mother with a child with odd,I have read this and it has given me new hope. I was confused and really antsy when I found out my kids had odd. i knew that I needed to know how to deal with this and how to also help my kids. This book has helped me know what odd is about and how to handle my kids. I would recommend this book to anyone dealing with odd.
4,Pure Metal Onslaught!,"I first was able to hear this band on Xtreme Metal Radio at live365.com. I must say this is some agressive metal. I was able to hear ""Illusion Possessor"" and ""Controlled by Mind"" before finally picking up this album. Both are definite stand out tracks. Pick up this album today. You will not be disappointed."
3,"alarming story, but could be written better","Alarming story of how a noted psychiatrist (who was obviously very sick herself, read the notes she kept on the case) was able to turn her own demons lose on an already disturbed patient. The psychiatrist was obviously baby obsessed and serverly neurotic after nine miscarriages in four years. Her treatment of the patient reads like something from the journal of a madwoman, in my opinion. the only complaint i have (i took this book out of the library) is the pacing is way too slow, the author painstakingly goes over the patients childhood and his sister's conversations etc etc, and the final outcome is only dealt with in the last few chapters or so. i think the writer could have written a much more engrossing story if she had paced it better and gotten to the heart of the matter quicker, after all the doctors' notes are the basis of the treatment. anyway i think the story itself worked well, and i enjoyed reading it."
5,Great,It's a great book for older kids. My daughter tore all the pop up parts out of the book so now we pretend that it's peek-a-boo.
3,Good For Tubbie-Fanatic Toddlers,"This pop-up book asks you who's hiding behind different things, with the Teletubbies being behind the first four hiding places. Then comes Noo-noo & finally all the Teletubbies are hidden. While 1 or 2 year olds who like the show will probably get some giggles out of it, the book's art work is lacking. It's pretty stale fare, especially the sky. Couldn't they have put at least one bird, or maybe the sun with the baby's face in it up there? This seems to be a rush-job to capitalize on the popularity of the tv show. Looks like it worked - the copy we have is a 5th edition. There's many other pop-up books out there that are done much better, but if your little kiddies love the Tubbies, I'm sure they'll dig this."
4,sprinter stick,Very handy to have after a squat and prowler workout. The only thing is to get the hamstring and lower back I have to call my heavy handed baby girl for help but we enjoy it when she acts right
4,the classic that started it all,"The first Megaman game I ever played was MM3, and after that I played a couple of later MM games before I finally played the original Mega Man. I immediately noticed several differences, but for a first game, this was pretty good. It's a bit clunky and simplistic compared to its successors (much like Final Fantasy 1 or Super Mario Brothers) but is still a nice, solid game. Definitely not the best of the Mega Man series, (this lacked in a password feature, and replay value is somewhat limited) this game still does deserve a try and to be played once if you're a die-hard Megaman fan."
2,Mega Man games got off to a rocky start...,"No energy tanks, fancy gadgets, spike invulnerability when hit, and two less robot masters than most games in the series make this debut the bad kind of hard. The stages and bosses are EXTREMELY hard without the right equipment. The next one, Mega Man 2, is where greatness would first be reached."
3,not as good as their previous material,"Their first two albums - ST DEBUT and VOODOO CARAVAN were excellant vintage heavy rock albums with swirling fuzz and organ to expand and enrichen their sound. This album, Hooray! It's a Death Trip, is decent at best, in my opinion.It's stripped down with no keyboards, no guitar solos and it's very dull and not so inspiring. Yes, it sounds like alternative-grunge SOUNDGARDEN. Even though I'm into SOUNDGARDEN, I do not appreciate a SWEDISH band that I highly admired for performing some of the best music on the planet to sell out to something of lower quality. Shame on you guys. This style is not meant to be yours. Don't ever do something stupid like this again."
3,was hoping for encore CD,"I do enjoy watching the musical performances, but thought this was a Encore CD showcasing the best of music from the first 2 seasons, which would have been awesome. Maybe in the future. I do think the songs this DVD has a lot of the best!"
4,++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++,it was a great christmas present ++ ++ =+ =+ =+ + + + + + + + + +
2,Take to long for delivery,As much as i love my Sicily it took extremely too long for me to receive my product. I had to call amazon and they told me that it stopped for a couple of days in cali then she gave me a off day for arrival i dont think i received my product until 2 days after that.. i ordered about a week before christmas and received my product the end of the first week in january. shame shame
1,Wade needs a technical editor in a bad way.,"Every point made in this book takes days to develop, and then it ends up being some generality that anyone with half a brain already knew. A tedious read that easily could have been condensed to 1/4 the size. Filled with typos and grammatical errors to boot."
5,Excellent,"This album is incredible. I have vague memories of my great-grandmother speaking and singing in Italian, but I don't speak or understand it. Nonetheless, this album is amazing. A work of true historical importance and a valuable piece of Italian culture."
5,Ambient Classic,"This cd has been around for a long time and it's a great collection of classics. To this day, it is my favorite ambient-style cd to work to, and I've listened to many."
4,Good looking mirror,"The mirror is as described. Bronze and easy to install although it did not come with the two screws to attach it to the wall. ....and yes, I double check the box and packaging. Very quick shipping and box clearly marked ""Fragile - Glass"" Happy with my purchase."
4,Great game,This game is great! it's fun to crush the cars and this is the first monster truck game where when they crash the damage looks real! the only bad thing is it has to little of trucks to choose from and theres no gravedigger or goldberg??! i mean whats up wit dat????
3,Okay,"This is still a fun game just like the super nintendo version but I must warn you that this is tetris attack 0.9You lose many colors and animations that makes the original so bright and happy. The lame disappearing blocks and bland colors seem extremely retrograde compared to the super nintendo version.If you are a hardcore tetris attack fan and haven't figured out a way to take your addiction on the road without your gameboy, then I would suggest this to you but you have been warned!!"
5,"PROMISING AUTHOR, Expect the Unexpected!!","I LOVE IT! This new lesbian erotic novel brought intelligence, eroticism, and creative adventure to new heights with a hot cast of characters (that I would LOVE to meet). Make sure you have time when you sit down with it because you won't put it down!"
2,Game is not that fun,"The Oregon Trail is a really fun, easy to figure out game. My whole family plays it with the computer hooked up to the TV in the living room. Africa Trail is too complicated and not that fun."
5,sweat game better than the first one,"first of all this is a great game!kind of short but still great.awesome graphics and sound.you start the game off with a prologue mission.then you jump right to desert missions.then valley and village missions.and then missions in the snow.the missions are pretty long and involve alot of thinking.you get to drive tanks,boats,planes,and jeeps.you even get to blow peoples heads off with a flack gun!it's a really hard game to play especially when there is like 15 tanks shooting at you.deffinetly worth the money.might still want to rent it first."
3,fun... but boring,"Don't get me wrong this game is near perfect. But this game is not as good as i thought it would be. i waited for 3 weeks 4 this. this is a good game but is lacking in many ways.1. like from previous reviews,it;s tooooooooo short.2. can be repetative. On g4 they said a.i. is strong. that is not true. they are weak!! the missions can be hard but they r always the same. the freakin nazis storm out of the same areas every time.3. the missions are linear. same obl. same deaths.4. the men in ure group are invincible and the one that do died are scheduled to do so.5. missions can be boring often. its basically destroy this,kill them,get here and run. BORING!!!i like the game but cant believe i presured my mom to take me and buy it. for that i am truly sorry.this gets a three but i may have put a higher score.wait for the price to go down and you wont be very dissapionted."
5,EXCELANT GAME,Call of Duty Big Red One is the best WW2 game I ever played. The AI is much smarter and the weapons are realistic. If you want an ecciting game with a little bit of WW2 history than buy this game.
4,Better than most,"I do not give it 5 stars because it is not totally amazing - but it is good and it is simple. I did not find the peel to be so great - it gets warm and has some nice grit but actually I have found that baking soda does a really nice derm-abrasion and costs way less! If you can not afford this try a week of adding baking soda to your cleanser and then steam a bit of olive oil on your face before bed. You will also see results. I have been hunting for products that ""DO MORE"".The Philosophy Makeup Optional Set has reduced my pore size - love that! There is an odd smell to the drops but it goes away really fast. The cleanser leaves your face feeling really nice and clean. The hope in a tube is great under eye make-up!"
2,Breakout Central!,"I was very excited to try the Philosophy Makeup Optional set. A friend of mine got it a while ago, and absolutely raved about it. I was so looking forward to sharing the experience.However, it didn't work out that way. I gave the kit 3 weeks, plenty of time for my skin to adjust to the new routine. And during those 3 weeks, my face just kept breaking out. I had to stop. Now I've got $70 worth of little-used product collecting dust in my bathroom.To be fair, I've always had somewhat sensitive skin. The products in the kit are all very thick, especially the moisturizer, and I probably would have been better off with something with a lighter texture. Live and learn!My friend is still a steadfast believer in this kit, and she looks great, so clearly it does work well for some people. But just be wary if you have sensitive skin.I never tried the microderm peel, so my comments don't apply to that particular item."
3,verb conjugations,"What I like about this produce is that the verbs are in alphabetical order. What's missing to make it a good purchase is that there is no color distinction or size variation between the main verb and its conjugations. Also, the print could be larger considering the size of the book. I would have been happy to pay a bit more to have it be more user friendly.river runner girl"
2,more of the same,"this is the same recording as Red Hot and Live with one more song. Also the same recording as Respect Yourself and Live (out of print on Tomato Records). This live recording seems to be reissued way to many times, I must assume that everyone owns the rights to this recording? Well at least it is cheaper then Red Hot and Live."
3,1996 Acura Integra,"I bought this to replace a broken passenger-side mirror. The mirror comes with two short pieces of two-sided tape, so I'm hoping it is secure enough to hold it in place since the mirror doesn't fit completely within the bezel. If the mirror would have been about 1/8"" less in width, it would have been ideal."
4,Great economy protector,"Great little protector. Came with protective film on it. Snaps on and hasn't ""fallen"" off yet. A bit of a dust magnet, but not enough to complain about."
2,I really wanted to like this book.,"This one was a struggle. A friend recommended it and I wanted to like it, but I continually got bogged down. There was one chapter in particular, at el jefe's banquet, that had me enthralled. Too often, however, I had trouble continuing along through overly precious journal entries and other seemingly endless diversions from the narrative."
4,great read,Well writen book great story bought for my sixteen year to show her women's powers of achievement love it will pas it to others because its worth sharing
4,Kindle version needs editing.,"It's a good thing I bought this on sale for $1.99. If I had paid full price I would be very upset by all the typos in the Kindle version. But it still bothers me. It's distracting and cheapens the experience of reading Kindle books. Whenever this happens I make a point of not purchasing other Kindle books by the same author and instead, buy print versions instead.Hopefully publishers,authors and Amazon read reviews and will eventually do a better job of creating ebooks. It would be nice if there was a way to report errors. If it doesn't improve I will go back to just reading printed books.For now, I would not recommend the Kindle version of this book (not if you're fond of punctuation anyway)."
5,"learning history from a ""novel"" almost","I love fictionalized accounts of historical events, and this one was particularly powerful. Alvarez filled in just enough detail to make these women not just historical figures, but people I loved."
4,After the book and the film,"The story of the Mirabal sisters is alive and well today in the Dominican Republic. Still the generation that survived the Dicatorship of General Trujillo seats on elite ground in the Island of the Hispaniola.Comparing the book , the film and the history we can see gaps, hits and misses. The true story of the island is still covered under a veil of mystery, still to this date most of the characters of the book; maybe even their killers walk freely and with no remorse.The island in itself is a beautiful set, the human casualties of the Trujillo era has been uncovered ever so gently . Until just recently the horrors of the era were exposed and freely written by authors like Balaguer, in ""La isla al revez"", by Mario Vargas Llosa"" La muerte del Chivo"", and Julia Alvarez is brilliant in her descriptions.She teaches in Middlebury College,VT; I personally love her writing style and descriptive style of colors,enviornments and characters."
5,In the Time of the Butterflies,Great movie- A must have for anyone who's interested in learning more about one's culture.
2,book shipment,Book did not arrive in condition noted. The pages started falling out when I started reading it. However it was a good price.
5,A Powerful Work,"From page one, I was swept up in the world of four sisters, fighting a dictator in the Dominican Republic. Alvarez's writing is very rich and wonderful."
5,"Reasonable price, good quality.","I use this to carry my lunch, thermos and other items to work. Better than the other tote I previous use....that fell apart in less than a year."
5,"hopefully, baggallini could consider to also ship this product to places outside the US","i have several baggallini bags but unfortunately unable to buy this one as i live in Asia and this product is only available for those who live in the US. i used to beg my friends to bring baggallini bags for me when they travel to Asia. hopefully, baggallini could consider to also ship this product to places outside the US. There are lots of consumers in Asia would like to have more opportunities to buy all your well-designed and lightweight products."
5,Travel Essential,"I've used one of these bags for several years and I love it! It folds together and zips up into a small package that easily fits into a suitcase or carry-on, then unfolds to hold a ton of stuff when you need it. I've used it on the return trip as an airline carry-on bag for breakable souvenirs, and the durable fabric and zipper top are great features. I've also stuffed it full of dirty clothes and other unbreakable items and checked it so I could free up space in my regular suitcase or carry-on bag. Highly recommended and well worth the price!"
4,"Good, but not quite great","Had a friend flying into town, and so bought this in advance of our fiesta of baking. The handles on this pin are amazing -- they fit our hands well and magically stay oriented perfectly. The pin is a nice weight. And it's the only rolling pin I've seen that's dishwasher safe! The downside is that it's not non-stick, not by a longshot. Granted we were using gingerbread cookie dough which is notoriously sticky, but in order to keep the dough off the pin, we needed to use copious amounts of flour, which affected the look the taste of our cookies -- not good. Bottom line: user-friendly more than cookie-friendly. Will have to update this review once I've tried the pin on other kinds of dough -- cookie, pizza, and otherwise."
4,"""Love, Sal"" is a Laff Riot!","This is one of the funniest, most hysterical books I've read in the past few years! Buy it or...Daddy spank!"
2,Companion to Gotta Have Wa,"Aside from a few passages, this is merely an expansion upon Robert Whiting's 1980's classic You Gotta Have Wa, which chronicled the experience of American ballplayers in the NPB. Rather than interview career Japanese players, he elects to interview Americans who played in Japan. This merely expands upon themes discussed in no less than three of Whiting's books, and as a whole adds little to English language analysis of the game. It was disappointing when Whiting broke little new ground in his long-awaited book, and even more disappointing to see another derivative work. For the serious fan only."
3,"Looks good, quality not so much and BAD PACKAGING",Packaging not enough to allow for long distance shipping!! FRAGILE on the box doesn't really make a difference to someone throwing around a box weighing over 50lb. Obviously dropped on a corner. One leg bent in and weld to seat broken on one chair. I have other Strathmore chairs and the welds are much smoother and less noticeable. The welds on these chairs are bumpy. Didn't return chairs and take the risk of this happening again - have a friend who is in the process of fixing it.Overall I really like the chairs but packaging could be a lot more substantial. I probably wouldn't be bothered by the look of the welds so much if both chairs had arrived in tip top condition. I guess for the money (on sale) they are a good buy if they arrive in good condition.
2,Fluff,"I hoped this book would provide inspiration and novel approaches to inspire my design projects, but I was sadly disappointed. Most of the projects featured, although obviously expensive to produce, lacked concept and clever ideas. I would rather see projects that started with a great idea, then added the special effect to really shine. Instead, this was all about special effects for the sake of special effects."
4,Great Reference,"This is a great book for art directors and graphic designers to get some inspiration. The book definitely revolves around a modern/contemporary type look. Most clients would find design like this a little too ""cutting edge"" for their taste. However, this is a great reference for ideas and production techniques."
3,Oldschool but short and sweet !,"This has got to be one of the hardest of the ""Z"" games to ever come to NES. But heck, its one of those that started it all back in the 80's. Not the best thats for sure, but it is good !"
5,Legend of Zelda,"I use to play this game when I was kid. I never turned the game over and decided to give it another try about 20 years later. The game is just what I remembered and I love it. My kids can't imagine why I love the game so much, but it just helps me relax. As before, hours and hours can go by when playing the game. This game is for the older gamers that don't need the special features of today's games. The game is very hard to find new, however, I've found that used ones are just as good once they are cleaned and taken care of."
5,Zelda is Da Best,"I just got the game yesterday, it came fast. The quality of the game was just as the seller described, if not better. The whole package was just what I expected. I haven't tried the game out yet because I'm waiting for my NES system to come in, lol. But the game seems like it's going to play perfect. Can't wait."
5,The one that started it all...,"Yeah, this one is very old, but I'm surprised to see that only two people reviewed it and that they didn't even have it. I'm old and I have it, and you should go try to find a copy. It's very dated and doesn't hold up to today's game graphics, but man! This game was amazing when it came out. It's also pretty tough, and when you beat it, you get to play a second quest, which looks pretty much like the first one, only it's about five times harder than the first one! Get this one for a challenge. Or just get the new game boy oracle of seasons and ages. Those are the best zelda games of all time."
5,cool,"I don't even have this game because it was sold out. But I heard it was pretty cool. Plus, i'm the first reviewer of this product. I would get it if it wasn't sold out since i have ervery other Zelda game except for the new ones."
3,"Okay, but definitely NOT a hunting game","This game is okay. If you're looking for a hunting game don't buy it, you don't really hunt, you walk around and get attacked by animals and you have to kill them. It is pretty fun the first time you play it but it is not a very long game. I gave it 3 stars because it is pretty fun but I was expecting an actual hunting game."
1,Not Worth Your Time of Money,"In my 40+ years of reading true crime books, this was one of the most boring (and confusing) books I have come across - so much so that I almost didn't finish it (a rarity for me). Not only did the author spend way too much time describing people and events that were not central to storyline, but he failed to establish any foundation for the ""facts"" he did present about the ""thoughts"" and actions of the central characters. Part of my disinterest in the book was due, I am sure, to my intolerance/impatience with the immaturity of the teenagers about which this book was written - but it (my lack of interest) was also due (largely)to my impatience with the author's writing style -- the story about these boys could and should have been written much more concisely."
5,Riveting!,"Clever and thorough, I found ""Someone Has to Die Tonight"" to be the best piece of investigative journalism I have read to date. Congratulations to Mr. Greenhill on such a monumental achievement."
5,Music Never Sounded So Good,"Listening to this CD has been one of the best things I've done all year. With a great medley of keyboard chords, horns, and guitars, Full Speed Ahead has got to be the best album of all the small, independent bands out there. Pain has consistently come up with some of the catchiest, greatest sounding-songs out there and anybody who likes rock/ska would thoroughly enjoy this new album!"
3,old school fun,This is one of the games you play when you want to be entertained on a innocent junior high old school level. Grab some juice and chips and lets play. This game is lots easier and fun with the code. justin bailey. Under each letter of the name make sure you put these ------ ------.
3,"Don't get me wrong, this is a great game!!","Ok, this is a great game, but, it can be very frustrating. You die too quickly. Some enimies are very frustrating, like the purple flying robot, if he finds you, he will get to the bottom, so you can't attack him, unless you're lucky enough to have the ability toplace bombs while rolling. The first most frustrating ememy in the game is the flys that come out of the pipes. They're extremely annoying!! They're are not stupid, if you jump, they will go higher on the next attack. It is just so annoying!!! I reccommend this game, but, be aware that this game is frustrating. The other thing is that the password system is frustrating, because, it is easy to confuse different characters with others.Overall, I reccommend it, but, watch out for the flys!!!"
2,Small font and poor customer support,My install had a lot of hiccups and customer support was no help. They said they would let me know if there was an update available--never happened. I just donated it. I also didn't like the small font.
2,A christians desperate attempt to prove his God.,"I have no set beliefs, I am open to all ideas, this is why I purchased this book. But this book was a religious based opinion of a man desperately trying to disprove all alien accounts while at the same time even more desperately trying to explain his belief in his God. He fears aliens because their existance are a threat to his ""specail"" christian relationship with his God. Perhaps he should read, ""The Jesus Conspiracy"""
4,works great with @home,"returned my netgear and bought the linksys, worked on the first try, using dhcp, the 1.36 firmware, did not allow port forwarding, so i backed it down to 1.34 and it port forwards just fine, tech support was helpful as well, and did not have to wait 2 hours to get hung up on"
1,Overpriced and not very useful,"1. For the same money or less, you can get a linksys 4-port wired router, with built-in switch. The router being sold by Amazon one port, and has to be connected to an external switch if you want to connect more than one computer (a hub would work, but not nearly as well). If you're only running one computer, just run cat 5e cable from the cable or dsl modem directly to your computer's pci or usb adaptor.2. The single star rating is for value received, not for the quality of the router itself. Linksys makes good networking gear. Whoever wrote that this router can connect all your pc's, without reference to needing an external switch needs to go back to school."
4,Read the back of the manual first,It was easy enough to get this to work after I read an entry in the appendix. It would be good to read all instructions before starting rather than try to go step by step from the front. I had to remove the router and connect directly to the cable provider to get the information described in the appendix.The upgrade operation is easy enough. Be make hard copies of all your settings before you do. Everything goes back to the defaults when you upgrade the firmware
4,Works Great,Connected my existing network to the Internet. The setup was quick and painless. The price makes it very affordable!
1,Defective routers,"During the past two days I have worked with two of these routers in succession and spent approximately 3 hours on the phone with (or mostly waiting for) the company's technical support representatives. After exhausting other possibilities, the tech reps concluded that both routers are defective and I am returning them. (I bought the routers from a local retailer rather than Amazon.) Nearly as frustrating as the product defects was the company's lack of support for Macintosh. Although the router is capable of operating in a Mac Ethernet network, the setup instructions, both in the documentation and on the company's web site, have critical gaps for Mac users. To its credit, the company has 24-hour tech support. The tech reps are helpful but are not knowledgable about Macintosh. Bottom line: Might be okay for Windows users if you can find one that's defect-free."
5,AWESOME!!,"This book was so realistic!!I really felt I was on the Widow Maker,the Enchantress, and the Fox. These authors really did bring the pirate out of me and i'm glad. Life was getting pretty dull but this book livened it up in a flash. Too bad though i could only give up to 5 stars. It is worth much more.Hope this helps."
2,Mediocre monologues on the whole,"Could be a great book, for some. I, however, only found a couple monologues that interested me at all. Well formatted with scene descriptions at the beginning with age and genre."
5,Best Show on TV,"Archer is the best show on TV right now, and the 2nd season was much stronger than the first. If you're not watching this show, start right now!"
5,awsome show,super halarious cant wait for more. i hope theres several seasons and i wonder why only the first season is on netflix
5,Amazing Archer,There's something to be said about a cartoon that's got more wit and charisma than most television that's actually geared towards that...
1,Don't expect much,"For the price, I thought I'd give this data cable a try. A try was all I got. I got this for an older phone to transfer data and pictures to a newer phone, but never could get the phone recognized by the software."
1,Not as good as it looks.,"No instructions, came unusable twice, had to returned. It was more expensive because I paid for the shipment three times! (once when I first placed my order, twice, when I returned it for the first time, three times when I returned it again)It is not worth it, better go to your local phone store, you will spend less and might get a higher quality item."
1,Does not work,"I purchased this cable a while ago for my Nokia 6800 cellular phone.For the price, you can't beat it. But that's where it ends. It seldomly works with my phone, if it works at all. The connector is of low standard and I suspect that there's something wrong with the pin configuration, which doesn't exactly match Nokia cable. It also doesn't work at all with third party software like Oxygen, which gives you better control over the standard Nokia communication suite.You'll better off to buy the authentic Nokia cable for $10 more."
5,A look into the minds of Wall Street's elite money managers.,"Ken Stern's ""Secrets of Investment All-Stars"" is an incredible guide for all investors. Each investor offers clear, concise advice on how to pick stocks and manage your money. Most impressive are their personal success stories and the happiness it brought them. Their willingness to share their secrets makes this an invaluable guide to all who wish for similar financial prosperity."
3,Not that Good,"It seems to be handy when it is new,but later on... the mount wouldn't want to stick to the windsheild.The mount would fall off very frequently and might probably cause a damage the GPS which is holding on to it.The lack of suction in the tool is enabling it to fall off from the Windshield.Also it makes a rattling noise which cannot be avoided no matter what you do!!!I had problem with this several times while i am driving and When i park the car and come back only to notice it is lying on the floor of the car.But...we dont have a choice other than to live with it as the GPS is wonderful though .I think Magellan should take more interest in making this a better holder."
1,Will not stick to the Windshield,The windshield mount does not stick to the windshield.This is poor construction and design by Magellan.Having a lot of trouble with a brand new piece that I purchased.Looking at the dashboard mount now. But that dosen't seem to have much favourable reviews either.I may just return the GPS.Too much trouble to get started.
4,Great,"So far so good iv'e had this unit about one month and I'm delighted so far.Strengths: Great picture(Awesome), compared to plasma tv's, not much of a difference. Sound quality is great as well, with built in 8' speakers and integrated surround sound with a subwoofer connection as well.Weak Points: The remote control is a lil' more complicated than most but if you have a universal remote you'll be okay. It is a bit on the heavy side(about 50lbs) so wallmounting is questionable but if you have the correct brackets you should be fine.All in All a great value, a lil' cheaper that others in it's catagory. For those who download movies off of the net, it's Ideal for PC use as well as Sat and Cable."
2,To hard to follow for a beginner in her 50's,"I bought this feeling it would be easy to follow...not the case at all. It's spoken in Spanish & English, but mostly Spanish. You will need to know the dance moves prior to trying to video."
4,Quick cardio,"Wanted to try Zumba without buying the whole Zumba package. Excellent 15 minute cardio workout. Caution if you have young children. My daughter asked why the girls were wearing bras and underwear? So, if I use the tape it is when they are in school."
4,Good Instructional & Fun DVD,"The DVD arrived earlier than anticipated :-) The ease of purchase was nice and easy. The DVD is good for beginners and those that want a fun instructional DVD. Good break time inbetween dances or you have the option to fast forward to the next. So it is nice if you only have 10 minutes or 30 minutes...depending on your day. It is dissapointing that the music hardly comes through, but once you get into the DVD it's not really a big deal. Overall, good buy and would buy from this seller again."
1,Poor stereo,"I am in the process of sending my unit back for the THIRD time. For the same issues. It isn't playing ANY CD's now, says there is no disc. I have returned two others for the same issue. The sound is great, but the CD player really has issues.They are agreeing to give me a ""credit"" to use in their store, but I'm acutally a bit reluctant to purchase anything from Brookstone due to the issues I have had with the Acousticlear unit.Not worth the money for the issues and shipping charges I have incurred for shipping 3 units back for defect issues that are their issues not mine!"
1,Navipod Control,I was pretty disapointed to find out that this product did not work with either of our two iPods. Also that it does not come with a docking station so it requires you to buy more equipment to make it work. I am planning on returning it to Amazon.
3,You need to download a program to play on xp/millenium,"The gameplay is good old fashioned sonic style, but you need to make sure to go to wikipedia, search sonic cd, and download the program that lets in run on modern operating systems."
5,"Great Turtle game,","This game is a simple fighting game with the turtles as the fighters, i loved this game when i was younger and its still one of my favorites. The best part is if you fight against your friends as casey jones, or the best Shredder."
5,Solid Fighter Starring Some Ninja Turtles,"Really, this game is nothing flashy, but it's on par with Street Fighter II and is really a solid fighter for the SNES. If you're even looking at this it's because the game stars certain Ninja Turtles. And if that's what you're looking for this game more than delivers."
1,Never buy any plextor product,"This unit will never work with Vista based on the answer from their customer service. They sell you something over $200 without any insight for future with the motto that ""please stuck with our product for 20 years or till it dies without upgrading it to newer technology"". I wastedmu money because it doesn't work under vista and it never will. If they arethoughtful and kind enough they should put a recall and replace this product with something that will work with future operating software and software upgrades. I do not think so taht they will show respect to the people thay have already ripped their earnestly earned money. Such a shame taht they do not have any future incentives. Never again plextor....:-("
3,Top of bag is a little small,"I used these bags.... size 2, but I may go with size 3 next time just to get a wider top! I hope size 3 is wider!! I use these bags for ground coffee but they have no way of closing except to fold top over, I like the way they steep so I will use up all that I have until I reorder."
4,Very good,"Bags arrived promptly, were as represented and I have used many of them quite satisfactorily. A bit more pricy than desired."
5,fast delivery,the delivery was fast and Exactly what was advertised. Was very happy with my order will be ordering it again for future usage. I like the conviences of bag tea but like the healthy loose leaf tea so I bag my own.
2,Boring!,My 4 year old liked this for all of 5 minutes...the only time he showed any further interest was when friends would come over and want to try it. None of the kids seemed to stay interested once they had bowled a few times. I am sorry I bought this game.
2,A BIT LOUD!!!,"I bought this for my 3 year old last year. He has not played with it much and I doubt if he can even locate a couple of the pins! He played with it for about 2 weeks and soon grew tired of setting them up over and over again, while I grew tired of the noise they made when he would ""strike"". I guess the final straw came when he hit his couisn with one of the exremely hard pins. Well, so much for Silly Pins...."
2,Boring and dangerous,"My daughter received this last year as a birthday present. We both bore with the time it takes to reset the pins. It does not hold her attention, and I don't think we've bowled an actual game in the year she's owned it. The pins and ball are hard plastic, so make sure you are in an open area. We almost lost a window due to an enthusiastic roll."
3,This one got returned,"I was very disappointed. After about 5 minutes with new batteries the base seemed to get ""stuck."" It emitted an obnoxious buzzing noise and the off and reset buttons stopped working. We had to go get the screwdriver to take out the batteries and put them back in to reset it. After the same thing happened again this became one Christmas toy that got sent back."
5,Great for a grill,"My husband really likes this scrubber, its easy to use and when the scruber part is worn out I don't feel bad about replacing it."
1,Not a good source for mercenary work,"Forget the hype and pretentiousness presented in this book. He is obviously so underskilled that this is his only way to get work as a mercenary. As anyone who knows how mercenaries get hired and paid, the U.S. government hires hundreds of thousands of mercenaries through other corporations and especially through this time period of the war on terror. They are paid very well. The U.S. has paid hundreds of billions of dollars for mercenaries, or the new name ""Security Consultants"", through this war on terror. If you have military experience and have operation field experience (combat experience), it is quite easy to get a high paying mercenary job. You just apply online through these corporations hired by the U.S. government. 100% legal and legit and honorable working for your country."
3,Fun but frustrating.,"This games is frustrating due to the horrible controls. This becomes very evidant when fighting Soda Popinski. You hit him a few times you get tired, he hits you once your tired then your KO'd....lame."
2,Not the same Grand National,"While this band isn't terrible, this is not the same Grand National from England. Amazon acts as though it is. If you want a more raw, traditional rock album, this is okay. If you want the eclectic electronica-rock of the more popular Grand National, don't buy this album!"
1,"Run, run like the wind, as far as you can get","The battery life is extremely short. The first time around you might not notice it, but it gets progressively shorter until you can only take 3-7 pictures on batteries that read fully charge, the camera dock only seemed to make it worse. I sent it into Kodak, did everything they said and that didn't help either. It does take good enough pictures if you only want to take 3-7 pictures at a time. The Canon Powershot A60 is a much better camera. It takes great pictures and actually has as much battery life as you would need. (with rechargeable NiMh)"
4,Great Camera For EveryDay Users.......,"What I liked in this camera most, is the user-friendly functions, it's very easy to change settings and to Review your Albums while on the road, and the picture Quality is Super.As for the memory I got me the 64 Mb MMC card which is more than enough if you are thinking of Sending emails "" thats 200+ pic"" and 92 pictures for the highest resolution "" Equals 2* 36 films on the old cameras""as for the Cons: don't Repeat my mistake by not buying the Optional Easyshare Dock, because this Extra item will Help you Recharge the batteries that comes with the camera Box and they will live alot longer than the Standard AA Batteries "" which Bring us to the Last part of the Cons"": this baby Eats Batteries Like Popcorn, so make sure you got the Dock or atleast A Recharger For this Digital Camera..."
1,Junk!,"I purchased this camera and within one week I returned it. The craftsmanship and quality of this camera is awful! Most people probably see the name ""Kodak"" and assume it is a good camera. The only think Kodak is good for is film. First of all, the batteries that came with the camera died after 45 minutes of use. I thought it was a fluke and purchased and fully charged the rechargeable batteries. In around the same 45 minutes the batteries died. The screen on the back of the camera displays an awful picture and the power button is so small you almost need a sharp fingernail to turn it on. The software that comes with it takes forever to download photos onto your PC and the quality is terrible. ...Man this camera gives meaning to ""You get what you pay for"". It is pure Junk!!"
4,Review From a Future Critic,"I do agree with the person who said that this book should have had more on previous Justice Leagues, but if you just recently got in to comics and want to know more this book is a must have."
5,GREAT EXTRA FEATURES!,"This ""new"" edition DVD is well worth the money if you want extra features. The interviews and behind the scenes content is great and almost all of the cast tells stories about filming. If you are an ""extra features"" dork like I am then you will love this DVD."
2,old but sturdy,"The phone is fine in general. The problem was that a working charger was not provided, cables and headphone/mic was not provided as said as well. The back of the phone was damaged and was not verified before purchasing. I was about to return it but I didn't want to pay for the shipping and the restock fee, therefore only getting back less than half of what I bought it for."
1,Cheap Junk,"I am using the Blackberry 7250 through Nextel and need to move to a GSM service for business in Europe. I got a 7100g and immediately put it back in the box. I expected it to be different, but it's just a piece of junk compared to the 7200 series. The case is light and cheap feeling. The thumbwheel is hard to access and the menu structure is less friendly. Unlike the 7200's, the 7100 screen turns off with the backlight. No backlight - no screen. This has got to be tough on battery life. The screen has a large title bar across the top that takes-up way to much of the screen. What's left of the screen is simply too small compared to the 7200. Back in the box and back to Cingular to get the 7290 with the big screen, great thumbwheel, individual keys and quality feel."
4,All you need in a Blackberry PHONE,"After carrying around a pda and a phone, I decided to go for something that included both functions effectively. I had a ""smartphone"" before and though it was small and nice, it was very difficult to type in appointments and data with the tiny keys in it. The Windows Mobile was pretty good but not what I really wanted. I purchased this phone and immediately saw that I no longer had to bring 2 devices with me. I have a good function phone with great PDA functions included. I also set up the phone to receive my personal and my work email. Its good to have all these features in one phone. The bluetooth works flawlessly and though the phone is a bit on the bulky side, its not very heavy or uncomfortable. I recommend this phone if you are tired of carrying 2 devices to keep your schedules, tasks and emails. Really good phone with great features."
5,Great game not like the other Zelda games though.,This game is one of the better Zelda games out there a lot of people will tell you that this is a bad game don't buy it but its a very good game in the rpg style so its not at all like the other Zelda games and its very difficult if you don't play this game with a good strategy if you buy this game i would probably recommend you buy a guide or look up an online guide for your first run through the game since its difficult and theres a whole bunch of little things and secrets that you wouldn't ever know unless you had a guide or someone with you that has beat the game before but it is a good game to have and it will last you days even with a guide so overall I would recommend getting this game but buy it from a collector or one in excellent shape so you know its been took care of but as soon as you get it clean the pins so it doesn't gum up your 72 pin connector.
5,Zelda II The Adventure Of Link,Well Zelda 2 Or As A Lot Of People Spell It Zelda II The Adventure Of Link And This Was One Heck Of A Adventure The Story Well In The Last Game You Defeted The Evil Ganon And In This Game You Are Trying To Relese Zelda From A Sleeping Spell And You Have To Go Through I Think 7 Dungeouns And A Lot Later In The Game You Encounter Dark Link Who Was Also In OoT Awesome Game There Anyway Back To Zelda II This Game Also Has Monsters Trying To Kill link And Revive Ganon And If You Win Zelda Wakes Up And The Curtain Comes Down And Peoples Best Guess Is They Make Out But Any Way Get This Game If You Are A HUGE Zelda Fan
4,This Game is Great!,"This game is an old game yet it is still fun. There arecreatures and you have to use different guns,etc. Anotherthing if you like this game or any product, GIVE IT A RATING!!!If you don't, the product will get a bad rating and no onewill want it! Sheesh!"
4,A great value,"This sofa definitely looks more expensive than it was. It was well packaged and delivered in under one week. My only concern was that it sits pretty low to the ground, something that is very common to deep seating furniture. The cushions could have been a little better quality but I am still happy with them."
1,out-dated entertainment,"lets face it,new technology replaces old technology. its like a ford model-T. its good for car shows and museums, but not serious driving. the same can be said for the NES system. a reconditioned NES can sell for almost 200.00 ?? you have to be on drugs to pay that much (i dont care how many games are included ).....and a special thanx to the 18 hose-heads that disagree with me."
1,BUY THE REVOLUTION,The nintendo Revolution will be backward campatable through the nes games of the '80s so why would you waste your money on this? In with the new out with the old.
5,NES Core System,"was the 4th game system I bought in 1985. Sure you can pick up an NES at tag sales or flea markets for [price], but you don't know if it will work when you get home unless there is a way to test it out. Buying one for like [price] isn't too bad. at least you know it should work, and has been tested and cleaned. The biggest thing that wore out on the OLD NES was the connector in the cartridge slot(Which you can buy replacements for). But there are tons of games out there for the NES. Its a good starter system for the little ones of the house hold... So is the SNES or Genesis system.I still own an NES,SNES 1 & 2,N64,Genesis 1,2,& 3,Sega CD,Saturn,DreamCast,Nintendo Virtual Boy,Tiger game.com,gameboy,Gameboy color,Gameboy Advance,Atari 2600,7800,Jaguar 64 w/Jaguar CD,Colecovision w/Atari 2600 module,Nomad(Portable Genesis),GameGear,Xbox,Game Cube,PS2,PS1 w/LCD screen,. WHEW!So save those systems! They are full of history and fun still!I still play mine when I can to relax and unwind :-)"
1,Faulty equipment,"I ordered a original Nintendo NES system that never worked.I attempted to return the item several months after I'd received it but the seller wouldn't offer an exchange. He was perfectly within his rights to deny an exchange (as Amazon's policy states that you have one month to return faulty items), but I should again stress that I paid for something that never worked.Be wary about ordering anything from this seller."
1,Not worth your time or money.,"I have done numerous language courses, and this one has to be the most annoying. There are two sets of CDs...one to learn with the book and one to learn in the car or ""on the go"". Unfortunately, they are really the same thing. The ""on the go"" version is extrememly difficult to follow, it's poorly organized, and the same voices that want you to repeat the spanish keep saying ""lesson x, section n"" in spanish, then with no warning or direction start throwing actual phrases at you. It's tough to tell what you're supposed to be repeating/learning and what's just telling you what lesson you're on. I returned the program and purchased Pimsleur's Speak and Read Spanish instead. It costs a bit more, but if you order from the used section (which doesn't alway mean used), it's fairly comparable. This is the second Pimslear's course I've done and I am very happy with it."
2,Save your money,"Why are there are so many rave reviews for this book?I have been programming for around 10 years and have picked up many technologies from many books. However, I have been unable to understand Struts from this book alone. There isn't enough depth of coverage and the explanation is not at all clear.I appreciate the attempt to make it short and concise. However, it just doesn't work in this case."
2,Ugh. I read the whole thing and I STILL know nothing,"I have been developing web applications and web services on the Tomcat platform for a few years now. I know how to make web applications and how to make them well. However, after hearing all the buz about Struts I went online and read enough about it to get me interested.Unfortunately I bought the wrong book. I have read the entire thing and I am still not one step closer to deploying a Struts-based web application than I was when I first opened the book.It would help if the author built her example from the ground up and showed you each step of the process. This book is no more informative than looking at Comments in the source code."
3,laughter in safety,These clips are so funny. Especially the one with Safety Woman. I showed it at a safety meeting at work and everyone was laughing. I recommend them for entertainment value only.
4,A love meant to be.....,"In Secrets the second installment of Darrin and Kristina story, SG Cardin, treat us to the continuation of their amazing love story that builds a bridge from their past into their future in a crescendo of passion, pain, insecurities and lies, that affects all characters. The interwoven plot brings not only the Darrin's side of the family but Kristina's as well in a domino effect where every action affects all involved. Full of intrigue, mystery, and real life insecurities and misunderstandings that combine with the always present theme of eternal love keeps one glued to the story and it wont let you put it down until is complete."
2,One Song,I should have purchased two selections from this CD from iTunes. A little bit of Yo-Yo goes a long way.
2,What is this?,"This is a compilation of many different styles; look Yo-Yo can play bluegrass! Not really ""Classic"" Yo-Yo."
1,Woefully out of place in today's market,"Palm will soon discontinue this and continue to lower the price to free these from their inventory, so if you are a PDA user, or already have one, stop reading and find yourself a more worthy product.This is a ""poor man's"" PDA with all the basics and absolutely no frills. The screen is tiny by any comparison, and the chunkyness of this device hurts it most of all. The reverse backlight is devastatingly hard to look at, and strains your eyes terribly. Basic models from Sony today carry 16mb of Ram and built-in expansion, this has 8 with no expansion, and quite possibly the worst screen ever manufactured for a mass produced handheld.Stay away, I am glad I did."
4,Great for starters,"This is a great PDA for anyone starting out in the world of PDAs. The screen is a little small, but also very sharp. Including the additional software was a great step for Palm including MailSync and the Mobile Internet Kit. The only problems I find with it are the lack of accessories like modems and the OS is not upgradable. This is not a big problem for me but those of you who really care might consider the IIIxe."
4,Palm 105 - OK,"It's great! ...The great: It's got a great sturdy plastic frame. Price. Back light.The Bad: There is a few things I wish this palm had. The 160 x 160 res could step up to 320 x 320 like sony's clie. The Screen could be brighter and clearer. And the ability to upgrade memory would be nice. Eight (8) megs are ok in the palm world of yesterday. Today's palm work needs at least 16megs or more. I also own the Sony clie sl10, tho it competes with the M125, I find that owning palms require a memory upgrade after you pack them with a mapping program and a very healthy address book. So, if your looking for ONLY a address book and a few low end games. this is the palm for you. If you need something worthy of growing with you and you feel mapping or office documents are needs of yours, Get one that's upgradable."
1,Crummy,"I just bought this and after spending way too much time on entering data, the screen got stuck and I had to do a hard reset and it continued to stick at that one spot not to mention the fact that all the data I had entered was gone. Needless to say, I am not impressed and the thing is going back to the store. It has left me with such a bad impression of this type of device that I'm going back to paper calendars, lists, etc. I was really hoping it would work out. Don't waste your money."
1,Thumbs down,"I had to return two m105 units because of problems with the digitizer--text and other inputs were not being correctly read, which is a pretty serious problem. Besides that, the screen really is tiny and the unit feels more like a toy than a quality handheld computer. I wanted to love this model, and the web browser and note pad features are great, but I wouldn't recommend it. I eventually got a Palm VIIx and love it. It's a much better value for the money."
5,Just like the movies... Awesome!,"I absolutely love this book, it had me from the beginning to the end! It was pure Indiana Jones from the movies. It had the adventure, the mystery, the romance, and the Indy humor just like the movies. If they were to make a movie from one the book series it would be this one!"
1,Mediocre or even worse!!!,"Fotunately I got to listen to this cd after discovering it at a library. Otherwise - if I had bought it - I would have wasted a great deal of money. The whole recording is a emotionless dull mix of sounds and unlistenable songs. Well, of course there is an exception: ""He`s distant from me now"" is in my eyes a nearly perfect song, hummable and alive. If you want to spend money on a cd for the sake of one song: go ahead, I wouldn`t..."
4,Nice addition to my POTO collection.,Actually got this cd because of John Barrowman (Raoul). But it's really quite good and a great addition to my other versions (stage & screen) of the POTO.
1,NO COLOR SCANNING!!!,"I've ordered this product using mail order and got it yesterday.I assembled it and tried it and found out that it doesn't support COLOR SCANNING!!!!!!All you can do is Grayscale and B&W; scanning.And this unit is quite slow and generates a LOT of noise. I was planning to use this in one of my bedrooms and it does ""Self Check"" frequently and that even adds more noise occasonally.The printout quality is not so bad though....I'll just use this product as a fax machine, copier and laser printer. But who would want to have a B&W; scanner in the 21 century???"
5,gallery women's emboidered quilt jacket,I ordered the black first and then the wheat. This identical jacket is over $100 at my local mall. I ordered a small and it fits perfect. You could dress this jacket up or down especially the black one. It is well constructed - looks expensive and is a medium weight but not at all bulky. A very classy jacket. I am very happy with my purchase.
4,UCLA Professor compiles capitalist essays,"This UCLA professor's compilation of his radio essays is a welcome relief from higher education's usually pro-socialist dogma.His applications of reason and economic logic to real-world issues will probably irritate most 'modern' anti-capitalists, amuse and entertain strong minded capitalists, and invoke some serious consideration and premise checking in those who straddle the fence."
5,flag,"this subdued flag patch was exactley what I wanted except for the velcro backing which I easily removed.Looks great on chest of my jacket,I will get more for other jackets that I have."
5,Awesome patch,The patch got to my house within 2 days of being shipped. It is exactly as it looks in the picture. Looks great on the 5.11 backpacks! I'm very happy with what I got.
1,"Wrong color, no velcro","It took about 10 days to get here then when it did, it was the wrong color and had no velcro on it at all. I cant use it now."
3,Not One of My Favorites,"I bought this book because I love Nora Roberts and buy everything with her name on it. It was somewhat enjoyable, but her writing has clearly improved in depth over the years since these stories were written. I much prefer her more recent stories. &quot;In Dreams&quot; was my least favorite story. When I find myself wondering about pesky little details like travel documents and ID, the story hasn't grabbed me. I like her newer stories where the characters are facing more realistic challenges, although I do like the Three sisters series. Like I said, I'll buy ANYTHING with Nora Roberts' name on it because I'm almost always guaranteed a pleasurable read."
3,The stories never develop,"This book needs more meat. The stories are so short that the characters never get a chance to really develop. It's like reading a short story in a magazine. It can be entertaining, but it's not like reading a typical Nora Robert's novel. I was disappointed."
4,Surprisingly unique,"I'm a own a tattoo shop, and have bought so many tattoo magazines, and tattoo books.I get so many compliments on this book, from my from clients. It truely is a very unique history of the tattoo.Nice color photos, with a story as to why people got them. Would recommend this to anyone who's seriously interested in tattoos."
5,An Amazingly Weird Collection o' Tunes,"Okay, yeah, this has Fish Heads, but there is so much more to this album. First album by Mr. Mumy and Mr. Haimer, my favorite songs on here are the lesser-known ones: Linoleum, Cemetary Girls, Boogie Woogie Amputee, along with the very early rarities High School Gym and Three Drunk Newts. Clip Clop is also fun. I've taught it to some of the youngsters I know. And there are some Korean students in Pusan who know Fish Heads now...hehehe..."
3,Expensive!,I wonder how the sudden $20 increase imposed in fall 2008 is justified - considering this recording was made 10 years ago and is so old that modern Macs can't even open the extras?I notice the Herreweghe St John Passion has also just jumped twenty bucks.What's going on?
3,original?,"This is NOT an original; don't be fooled. It works fine, but it's aftermarket. Three stars for false advertising, but would still recommend otherwise."
4,Good insightful book on basic numerology,"No matter what religion, we all know numbers have significance.This book is a great read with lots of detailed information and explanation into who you are according to your own unique numbers. I completed the book in less than a day. I recommend it highly. I didn't rate it a 5 because nothing is perfect."
2,Gylnis has your number,The book is for beginners and too commercial.There are better books out there.If you are looking for a fun read this is it.
1,Save your Money,"Book was decently written but if you put faith in the content you may as well put faith in the Tooth Fairy. ""8"""
3,I tried & tried & tried,"I read the book, listened to the cd... & tried & tried & tired... but my spirit guide just wouldn't talk to me... I wonder if I pissed them off.:-("
1,must be hype,"I received this book for Christmas and was excited to explore numerology.I started figuring out my life path number and so on. It did not relate to my being or personalityat all. I thought I worked the formula wrong so I did again and got the same results.I then went onto do my husbands numbers and then my daughters numbers. Again off, maybe some slight truths to thecharacteristics but not enough to convince me. Thumbs down and i do not recommend."
2,She's great on the radio!,"I heard her and bought the book but was disappointed. It is very simple and gives you your life numbers, but the general categories aren't much help in analyzing self, friends, or family."
5,ANOTHER ONE OF CRIS LEWIS FINEST!,"If it's Chris Lewis, get it! I bought his 2 CD set, CRISIS twice because I wore it out from playing it so much. And when I saw he had another, I just had to get...and I'm not disappointed at all!!! I love this brothers ministry/music! IT IS A BLESSING!!! Please see my review for his 2 set CD called CRISIS:CHANGE IS REQUIRED! His music truly ministers!! He should have much more recognition than this. I learned of him at my church. He came there and I still talk about that service! He has a ministry and an anointing! WE WERE GREATLY FOR SURE BLESSED!!!"
1,Ismilism - A true muslim religion,"It is very sad to see people like Akbarally live in this world and have nothing but hatred about Ismailism. Ismailism is PURE muslim religion. There is a sureh called ""Sureh IKHLAS"" in Quran, recited by Ismailis three times a day. In which it is said there is only ONE GOD and HE is not born by someone and nor someone will be borned by Him. GOD is THE DEVINE LIGHT not a human body. Ismailis bow in front of THE GOD, THE DEVINE LIGHT not a human body. Ignorants look at the outside and not what is inside of this great religion.""Sureh Fatiah"", it is said as mother of all sureh, recited by ismailis atleast three times a day. This sureh means that all praise is due to Allah(THE GOD). HE is the ONE and ONLY ONE will judge the peolple what the people did in their lives.If one can't bring love to this world then atleast do all human a favor and dont bring hate either.May Allah direct all human in the right path. Amen."
5,Yoshi Nes,"I have yet to play this game, but I was very pleased with the transaction and with the condition the game was in."
3,Good Tetris like game,"This is a pretty good game, much like Tetris. There is an original concept though, because little monsters drop down like blocks. They drop down, you do not turn them, instead Yoshi is at the bottom of the screen holding up four plates (to collect the monsters), and you move him around, and pivot these plates to collect the monsters. Its not that simple though, the only way to kill these monsters is to capture them into egg halves that drop down. First get a lower half of an egg, drop a few monsters onto the half egg, then drop the top half of the egg. Then the eggs, squeeze together killing the enemies! Like a verticle Tetris!"
1,Boiler-plate collector publishing at its worst,"A great topic, ruined by horrendous art direction, amateurish writing & editing. Schiffer seems to grind out books in any and all topics as fast as they can, instead of putting out titles that are well-researched and designed. What a shame."
1,Not True,This product claims to fit a 17 inch laptop... but it doesn't. It actually looks like the picture with the laptop hanging out the end!
4,17 inch sleeve,I bought this sleeve for my 17 inch laptop for college and I really like it. It seems to protect my computer and an online purchase seems to be the only way a 17 inch can be fit for a sleeve. I get a lot of compliments on how stylish it is and it works with everything I need it for.
1,NOT for HP 12.1 tx2510.,"I read reviews all over reading good and bad and it sounded like it would fit for the most part. The laptop (hp tx2510) CAN fit... if you take the battery out but even at that it's still very tight and frustrating to get it in the sleeve, and who wants to take their battery out every time? Even when thats out its still hard to even get it to zip shut. Aside from sizing issues... I like the case. Maybe the 13.5"" sleeve will work."
2,"Too big for 13 "" laptops","Nice product , but suggetsing that this is a fit for anything less than a 14"" laptop is misleading ..as the laptop fits too loosely. I returned mine as my Sony 13.2"" floated in the sleeve,the 12-13"" model is a snug fit."
2,Not the right info to pass the test,"The book gives a great synopsis of installation and touches on config issues, but that's about it. It barely touches the surface and is certainly not enought o pass the exam. In fact the preperation that this book provides doesn't even compare in the least to the actual exam questions. Advice: Spend your money on a better book to pass the exam."
2,You will FAIL 70-87 if you use this book!,"Do not use this book as your main study guide. In fact, don't even use it as a suppliment. Practically nothing I saw on the test (55 question, non-adaptive) was covered in this book. I almost feel guilty for saying this about Exam Cram because I found that the TCP/IP 70-59 Exam Cram book was very good. Good enough to be the only reference guide you will need for that test. If only the IIS 4.0 Exam Cram could live up to the TCP/IP Cram.Where the TCP/IP test is best studied for by memorizing facts (ARP, TRACERT, PING, the protocol layer, etc.) because it is protocol-centric, IIS 4.0 is best studied with a thick book and lots of hands on because it is a program, not a protocol. This book attempts to cover way too much in a very condensed fashion."
1,Don't count on this one to get you past the IIS 4 test.,"What a dissappointment in a otherwise great series. If you want a ""First and last book you need to read before taking the test"" this is not the one. I found the book to be short on information needed to pass the test. The practice questions were weak and not even close to what you will experience on the test, and even suggests that the authors haven't even taken this particular exam. Look elsewhere for help on this one.A one star book from a five star series."
1,A black sheep!,"I am very impressed by other titles in the same series (Core and TCP/IP). But this one is way below the level! It contains some decent summary info, but the questions are just not to the point, let alone quite a few wrong ones. Bottom line is: don't count on this one."
2,"Lots of Sample Questions, Missing necessary depth","After successfully passing 4 of 6 exams, I was wondering which exam to hold for last... After purchasing this book purely by Amazon's readers recomendations it's pretty clear that IIS will be that last and final exam for me. As I will need to find additional study material for the IIS4 exam - this book has lots of sample questions but the explanations are too simple and quick.Thicker books may be the way to for further and more applicable study in conjunction with this book. Use additional material to index and explain a concept or question in depth with this cram guide. Questions are great but without much detail in explaining a particular set of questions, this will not be your only study guide to successfully pass the IIS 4 exam.At the time of my purchase of this book, it was rated above 4 stars - I hope to justify lowering that review a tad."
1,Worst of the 6 Exam Crams I've used so far...,"I recently completed my MCSE by passing IIS 4.0. Like the previous 5 exams I had taken, I passed it on the first try, after using a CBT computer-based course, Transcender practice exams, and the Exam Cram book for the test. Unlike the previous 5 however, the Exam Cram book for IIS 4.0 failed to deliver.The other Exam Crams I've used (the four core books + TCP/IP) all contained a wealth of information that made me feel fully prepared walking into the exam room. The IIS book is very shallow, glossing over or skipping important topics and providing very little in the way of ""meat"".The practice questions in the book are simplistic, with no bearing on the real test. Answers given often have incorrect explanations or incorrect answers.Bottom line: A disappointment from this excellent series. At least I passed."
2,IIS Exam Preparedness,"The book gives a very basic and too-quick review of the product. It is an acceptable starting point but does NOT give sufficient preparation for taking the IIS 4.0 Microsoft exam. It is too shallow and contains too many outright errors to be viewed as a 'bible' prior to scheduling an exam.If used in concert with an acutal class, it may be sufficient, but as itself in a standalone effort (even coupled with actual practice events) it does not provide sufficient detail to pass the exam.In addition it contains too much 'cut and paste' form to be of even medium depth technical detail."
5,Gotta have it,"Excellent collection, except I wish they could have picked another B.B. King tune than the overrated ""The Thrill Is Gone."""
1,I agree this book IS garbage,"I used this book as a text in a college heat and mass transfer and despite an overall 3.9 gpa, I managed to fail this class. The book is completely unclear and utterly impossible to decipher. Stay away from this book."
5,EXCELLENT BUY,"Starry Night Galaxy Explorer (PC & Mac)THE BEST 'STAR GAZER' I HAVE EVER HAD; EASY TO USE, FUN TO PLAY WITH; IN 3 MONTHS OFSTEADY USE I HAVE YET TO FIND A FLAW. AND THIS IS ONLY THE 10 DOLLAR VERSION OF""GALAXY EXPLORER"" I AM SAVING MY MONEY TO BUY THE BIGGER VERSIONS.GAVE A COPY TO MY GRANDSON, TRYING TO INTEREST HIM IN ASTRONOMY."
4,Cute Enough,"I was intrigued by this soundtrack. When I found out that Hillary Duff sang one of the songs and everyone was just raving about it, I had to see what all the commotion was about. It's a cute enough soundtrack. I'm sure the kids who watch the show will get a kick out of it. While Duff's song isn't the best vocally, she does a good enough job and manages to pull it off. It's amazing how a studio can make a voice sound."
4,Lizzy Mcguire,This cd is pretty good. It has a lot of good artists and i am glad to hear Hilary Duff sing.
4,pretty solid pop,"If you like upbeat alterno-pop music like No Doubt, Everclear and early Posies, you'll probably like these songs. Decent lyrics about self-indulgent teenage partying themes, along with repetitive guitars and Smiths -style minor-key crooning."
5,Great therapy technique,"I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in overcoming their own internal struggles or who wishes to help others with their struggles. ACT adds some important elements to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, adding to our knowledge and perspective in dealing with internal issues. The use of metaphors is effective. So are the sections that break down and focus on the different aspects of this therapy technique, including acceptance (willingness), mindfulness, and valued action. As a mental health worker I am excited to utilize this technique (and have some here and there already) and was able to benefit from it myself. After all for those of us that work in the mental health field, it often seems to be the case that it is our own struggles and growth that lead us in this direction."
1,It deserves less than one star.,I absolutely without doubt dislike this book. I had to purchase it for ACT therapy and hated reading every page. It is very wordy and doesn't get to the point. Nothing in this book is clear cut. It is very poorly written!
3,Complicated,"The book is complicated and very technical. The parenthetic references, theories and names are overwhelming. More than once I zoned out and had to reread pages. I can't tell you if the advice works because I finally gave up reading. If you complete it you may have earned your license."
2,Not a fan,"As a therapist who owns a practice and has for over a decade, I find this book to be very difficult for many clients to use. Most people without a history of psychology education really struggle with the book. The exercises are ok. I would not consider using this book again, after having a couple clients struggle with it. There are other workbooks and texts, if you are interested in ACT, which are much more user-friendly, I think."
2,Unfortunately disappointed. Nothing new to see here.,"Bought this book based on the recent article in Men's Health on this topic, featuring the author Steven Hayes. Having read many psychology books and other self-helpish books, I was anxious for some new paradigms. Unfortunately, I looked and looked in this book, and just saw more of the same.The premise is somewhat unique, the 'suffering is everywhere, trying to avoid it makes you crazy, i.e. neurotic' basis of the book.You can sum this book up in the famous quote, which I will ruin here, 'Life is a struggle, the sooner you realize that the better off you'll be'There is a section on goal-setting? Meditation? Very run-of-the-mill stuff for modern self-help literature.I really wanted to like this book, but it is a long walk for a brief and simple premise. You'd be better served reading up on basic Buddhist philosophy, but if you're coming to self-help for the first time, this book would seem comprehensive and interesting."
2,SOUNDS LIKE IT DIED AND WENT TO HEAVEN,"I can't for the life of me understand why this recording was made. It sounds like it died and went to heaven. The only cd to by is the origianl broadway cast album that is on Polydor and may still be available. Anthony Newly makes the recording. I saw the play and he was great. They killed the movie which is now on Video by not letting Newly reprise his role. It is also not on cd yet. If you can't get the Broadway cd, keep listing to the album. Don't by this cast album."
2,interesting but not the same,"We purchased the newest release CD of Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris, but also have the original album and there is very little comparison. At one time, we also had the original off broadway musical video but lent it to someone years ago and can't find one now. Any suggestions?"
1,Where is the original?,"After reading the reviews of this CD, I am extremely disappointed. I have the original cast on CD and was expecting to order one for a friend.I now discover that the Elly Stone, et al version is apparently not available. I'm not sure whether to go ahead and order this one or to wait and hope that the fantastic version will again be available. Please, someone out there, let me know if anyone can still obtain a copy of the first CD !"
2,FOLLOW-UP: Located a source for the original NY Cast CD,"I have available a source for the out of print CD of the original off Broadway cast recording of ""Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living In Paris."" Please feel free to write for more information.When doing so, please address your e-mail to me at oceanview5@home.com.Gary"
1,Disappointment.,"Having a clear memory of the original Off-Broadway recording, this is a major disappointment. To me, it can't compare. Some singing is even off key. Why is the original not available on CD? I thought that was what I was getting when I bought this, so I shall read labels much more carefully in the future!"
2,All the Songs Anyway,"I have to agree with the overall theme of most of the reviews. This album is pretty dreadful in its musical interpretations. The ONE thing I can say for it however is that it is actually more faithful to the ORIGINAL stage version the the much better-performed original cast version. What I mean by this is that it includes all of the music (several songs and the overture were not included on the original album)and the scoring matches the small cabaret ensemble more closely than the fully orchestrated versions of the songs on the original cast recording. So, it makes an interesting musicological ADDITION to the original cast album - but if I only had one, it would definately NOT be this one."
4,Great complementary resource.,"I bought this book together with the Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy PregnancyMayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy. Thought it is not as in depth as the Mayo book it is still quite complete and it covers family related topics, I liked the emphasis they put on fathers' involvement and how they can take part of this moment. It also covers women's care beyond the typical health problems and more into how to pamper yourself a bit too.I found one error in the whole book and it is that they cite the toxoplasmosis parasite as a bacterium and say that antibiotics would take care of it, when it is far from reality. Otherwise the information is very reliable."
2,While the book was OK,"And did provide a wealth of information, I personally now view the book as a reminder of my recent miscarriage at 10 weeks. This is not the fault of the author though."
5,Great Book!,This book is great! I love the color pictures and real-life images. It has a lot of wonderful information.
2,too general,"I wish I had bought other pregnancy books. This is too general and does not answer many questions. Okay for first book on general pregnancy, but great for reference."
3,It's ok,"I got very bored with this book very quickly. Based on previous reviews I thought it was going to be outstanding but I'm not at all as impressed as everyone else... Information inside is typical and comprehensive but no different than ""Mother of All..."" or ""What to Expect..."""
3,Ehh..,"It has some good info, but I was dissapointed. If you are a woman of color you can find most of this info on the web or from your DR. Save your money, buy it used or get it at your library."
2,So you want to own the Store :,"A general summary of how to start and run a store, almost common sense. Not very use full in terms of marketing and customer service. Based on an 'American' way of running a large size store instead of a boutique store."
2,I was not impressed,"Folks use your common sence and save the 12 bucks on this one. This book would be good for any one under 16, but for even themost sheltered adult this book will be a waste of your time. Good Luck"
2,Does not do justice to Greatness.,"Unlike the fortunate reviewer from New Jersey, I spent a fortune on obtaining my copy of this book. I liked this book in that it filled in a lot of the blanks about her early life and career, as in Australia we really only got to know this wonderful woman when she burst forth onto our screens as the magnificent Beatrice in ""Much Ado About Nothing."" However, on the whole I must agree with the other reviewers. I could have paid $2.80 for the latest Woman's Day magazine and got the same amount of depth. If you can get it from the bargain bin do it! But don't be a chump like myself and pay $45 for it. I suggest all Lady Emma fans out there should band together and persuade the magnificent lady to feed our voracious appetites and pen her autobiography. Did anyone else sense a very strong anti-Ken vibe?"
1,thats a shame,"When I saw the new CD was available and the first couple of great reviews I was just about ready to order it. But then I heard about the copy protection. Sorry, I only listen to CD via my PC. And if I really like it, I copy it over to my MP3 so I can listen to it on my commute to work.I can't spend this kind of money on a CD that I wouldn't be able to listen to."
5,Its a hit,"I have just read this wonderful new book to my 5 year old daughter, and we laughed our way through to the end. The book was very stimulating, I loved the use of rhyming and the descriptive manner in which it was written. The subject is something that our family can relate to so well, as we have always had several nicknames for each of our children, as I am sure alot of other families have. The illustrations were very engaging and I loved the finale, when Ellie takes back control. A thoroughly enjoyable first childrens book."
4,Lucky are those who pick-up this book!,"Although I must agree with Kirkus on the confusing introduction of many characters in the first chapters of The Lucky Ones, once into it I thought this was a very enjoyable book. The women characters are well developed throughout; wrapping things up at the end of the book started to chug along at what seemed like a break-neck speed. All-in-all, if you're looking for a good ""beach book"", you'll probably consider this choice one of The Lucky Ones"
1,Good only for 1 year,"Worked well for 1 year but after just 14 months, the bake control does not work. In order to work, I put it in between bake and broil but it burns the outside and does not cook the inside. For the amount of money, I expected it to last for more than a year."
2,Broke down after a year and a half!,"We received this toaster oven which we put on our wedding registry. It worked well for a year and a half and then just broke down. Previous to this toaster oven we had a cheap ($29.95) Black and Decker toaster oven which worked for 5 years and because of lack of aethetics - not malfunction, we 'traded up' (so we thought) for the Cuisinart one listed here. We have learnt our lesson! Don't judge a book by it's cover! Do not recommend this one!"
4,toaster oven/broiler,"So far we are happy with this product.It toast pretty evenly & will turn off when finished toasting.We have only used the broiler one time,will use more during winter,so no opinion on that as yet.The outside top & sides get very hot to the touch when oven is on -.I called the company about this & they advised me to use like a tea towel to cover & it will not burn it.So far so good."
1,Big Mistake,"I agree with the other reviewer that the toaster alarm goes off at all hours. It also sounded all day in my home while I was at work. Because of this, I wouldn't recommend the toaster to ANYONE. I have tried e-mail and phone calls to Cuisinart Customer Service to find out if there is a way to disconnect this alarm. THEY HAVE NOT RESPONDED. Don't waste your money on a defective product from a company with terrible customer service."
1,Didn't last.,"I liked this toaster oven very much until it broke after only 18 months of average household use. For $100 I expected better. Don't buy it. Looks pretty, but it is junk."
1,Went up in smoke,"Like reviewers on other listings for this item, mine also experienced problems with the controller in a little over 1 year of light use. It was set to oven on 350F for pre-heat and started producing blue smoke out the top vent. I took it apart to what happened. The control panel was burnt! Everything was perfectly clean inside so that wasn't what caused it. I would not recommend buying this toaster oven or even continue using it if you ualready have one."
4,Thumbs Up! Great little Toaster Oven Broiler,"I had this toaster oven broiler for over a year now and it is a great little oven. I can bake a 5lb chicken, turkey breast and bake a turkey meatloaf without any problems. The clean up on this oven is very minimal and easy. When I bake my chicken or turkey there is hardly any splatter mess in the oven. Just clean the inside oven with some spray cleaner and wipe with a paper towel and you are done! I love this oven so much I bought a second one. This is a great alternative oven to use for small meals. I do save on energy cost as well. Like I said, it's ""Thumbs Up!"" from me."
5,Best Video Game EVER!!!,"Call of Duty 2 is an excellent game. It is not an easy game but that just makes it more fun. If I were to be a critic, I would say this: ""An entertaining game that teaches the gamer about The Big Red One's history"". In a way it's educational. Teaches kids about where the WWII battles were fought, geography and history. Excellent game. Five+ stars! *****"
4,Big Red One For Christmas,"I could not find this game around here but my husband was really wanting it.A friend told me to check here (Amazon). Thank goodness I did.I found the game at a price I could afford. It arrived very quickly and is in perfect condition.My husband has had a great time playing it. Thanks Amazon.Thank you, Carolyn"
2,Bore,Hey Listen this is a stupid game and killing just germans and if u really want a good game that doesnt bite u in the rear end like it did me rite after i bought it then get Medal Of Honor Frontline!!!!!
5,Bunn Decanter black,"the design is great... easy to pour and no dripping,,, lexan top and metal bottom are non breakable and easy to clean... handle large and easy to grip... got this one to use as a primary decanter and an orange handled one for a second."
4,Great Songs - Not So Great Recording,"I have many Clannad cd's but wanted to listen to their earlier work. When I saw this 2 cd set for the price of a single disc, I bought it. I'm very glad I did. The songs are as good as the later Clannad work. The arrangements are simpler with a classic folk sound that is beautiful and is just what I was hoping would be the case. These early songs are great additions for a Clannad fan.This cd would have gotten a 5 star rating except the limitations of the source recordings are apparent with careful listening, especially through headphones. I went back to the Clannad catalog on Amazon and discovered that their first album's master tapes were lost and the only available source was a pristine vinyl lp. This probably explains the sound quality on some songs. The sound quality was why I deducted 1 star."
4,Every band starts somewhere,"Mana is the best rock and roll band out there today and have been for a long time now. One reason this is so true is because they are constantly changing their sound and improving upon their musical talents. Solo Para Fanaticos is not there best album by far, but after a few listens I was able to really delve into the music and get a better understanding of where Mana got their start. This album is a lot more pop rock then there current rock and roll sound but it is fun, energetic and has the same old Mana vibe. Give this cd a chance because it is interesting to listen to and has some really good songs."
2,Secret of the Sphinx should stay a secret,"To say that I am disappointed with the ""Secret of the Sphinx"" is an understatement. As I made my way through the book I wondered if this was indeed the same author who gave us ""Philospoher's Stone"" and ""Dinosaur Eggs"". Indy's travels to India and Egypt were quite underdeveloped (especially when compared to his action-packed stay in China) resulting in a storyline that just did not ""flow"" naturally. Don't even get me started on that completely misplaced time-travel bit at the end... The book also presented a tired, older and less-spirited Indy (who apparently had never been married before (which is false)) which was a terrible departure from the adventurous, sometimes maladroit, professor we have come to know. It's a shame that McCoy's last installment was so poor - it reminded me a little of Caidin's attempts at the IJ series a few years ago. What ever happened to MacGregor anyway?"
2,Love Lauren...If only the DVD weren't defective...twice!,"I purchased Lauren's first kettlebell DVD and love love love it! I was so excited for the 2nd one. Sadly, the killer abs section was defective and kept freezing. I sent it back for an exchange. I received the replacement and the whole DVD is frozen! I guess it wasn't meant to be, Lauren :-("
1,Kind of lackluster and boring,"After all the great reviews I read I was very excited. The workout is tough but repetitive. She as an instructor is pretty dull. And with her credentials I was hoping for more cues on alignment and safety. I get that this is vol. 2 but for me as an instructor myself, I never take for granted that people need reminders on those things. Afterall isn't that what ""instructing"" is all about. Not just showing moves like a dancer would but explaining them, pointing out muscles being used, and always safety reminders! She never once cued breathing which is crucial to kettlebells and never cued a pulled in abdominal wall for back safety. Maybe once she mentioned packing the shoulder girdle. It looked very ""made in the garage"" in quality and sound. I am thinking of returning it."
1,Bad product- bent in 1st wind storm after less than 2 weeks installed.,"Bad product- bent in 1st wind storm after less than 2 weeks installed. I had the same flag pole from this company for 7 plus years without ever taking down the flags. It finally, and understandably, broke at a pole base point (point where the pole squishes down to go into the next pole). This one best right in the middle.Obviously this is a product quality product. I am beyond disappointed and frustrated."
2,my fault,"Ordered this game set for my son and did not understand the term ""game key,"" which was not included in the item. When the error was discovered, the seller agreed that I could return the product and that the cost minus shipping would be credited to my account. All was done as promised."
5,It needed a break-in period.,"This is an update to a review I wrote telling how my Hamilton Beach #76380 can opener would not lock onto the can edge, nor would it pierce the can. Now that Hamilton Beach has replaced the cutting assembly for me, it gradually is working better and better. Today I opened a small tomato sauce can and a 16-ounce can of tomatoes with no difficulty. It pierced both cans and opened smoothly and quickly. It did, however, drop the 16-ounce can after opening, so I know now to keep my hand under it. In fairness to Hamilton Beach, I felt it was important to submit this update."
1,Died after 3 months!,I purchased this opener 12/6/06 and the motor quit 3/5/07. What really troubles me is that I probably only open five or six cans a week. Please don't waste your money.
3,Just OK,"This is not a bad recording but it has some serious problems. Although it's sung in English, some of the diction is so mushy (particularly the lead tenor's) that it's hard to tell what the language is. The vocal performances overall are missing the Viennese/Hungarian style. There's a bit too much of the English music hall stylistically, particularly in the comic numbers. Still, Kalman's music is glorious and deserves to be better-known than it is."
2,atomic ripp off,"im not sure the company that threw this boring and very odd video think people watch them. it had a lot of topics that had nothing to do with anything. save your money and keep searching around.there are alot of good ones, but hard to find."
4,Almost perfect but extremely HUGE,"I Originally wanted to purchase the Alpha omega convertible carseat but, it was sold out so I bought this one as an alternative. I love the seat My 8 month old (21 lbs) loves it too. When forward facing and while the child is in the seat it can be reclined whichis great (no other seat can do that). However this seat is extremely heavy and bulky (very wide) even in my durango. I really wish it was smaller. Im going to exchange this one for the Alpha omega I originally wanted and see how that works out. I would love to keep this seat but the size of it is forcing me to do otherwise. Other than the size of this seat I have no other complaints it very easy to adjust and buckle the straps on this seat. The foreward facing installation is pretty simple to get a tight fit it takes about five min. or less."
5,Brilliant Chill Out Bossa Nova,"I must agree to the previous speaker: WOW what a great CD.Julee Cruise, the great Chanteuse from Twin Peaks, set up an amazing Chill Out/Lounge-CD for relaxing or having eveinings with cold summerwines.Julee is one of the most interesting contempory artists worked with Hybrid, Badalamenti, Khan, David Lynch and here especially with Mocean Worker and the great musician JJ McGeehan.Beautiful decent strings are combined with smooth electronica: also the remake of FALLING, the Twin Peaks Theme Song.What a Woman, what a Girl!!!A real Classic."
4,Intriguing book reaching wrong audience...,"It's a shame that such a well-written, intriguing book is being found by the wrong audience. Namely, brain fried metal-kiddies who seem to use it as a guide to finding the most morally reprehensible new bands or as their new ""how-to"" book. Ironically most of this audience for the book seem to be American, despite the fact that the authors state that such a movement will never happen in the U.S. because of metal fans' wanton drug use and attention deficit disorder. Regardless, the book is a terrific read that I had trouble putting down. Although it does seem to lose it's focus in Varg's political ramblings late in the book, it is both fascinating and disturbing in it's portrayal of misguided youth gone to extremes. The authors also do an excellent job of reporting in an impartial, informative style rather than falling victim to sensationalism. Certainly, the right reader will appreciate the book and it's treatment of the subject of black metal."
4,Finally a book that telles the real story.,"Lords of Chaos was an excellent book. It really represented the black metal scene through the eyes of the people involved. The band that really turned me on to Black metal was EMPEROR I heard the song ""Loss and Curse of Revrence"" and I ended up with all there records, and a whole new outlook on metal. I first was in to Death and Thrash metal which I still am. I was surprised that the author represented Samoth, Varg, and Faust as being good guys, which no other thing I have read about black metal has done, most publications dont give these guys a chance. Thanks for a great book."
3,"not that good, not that bad","When reading this book i felt like i was reading something that i had already known and learing nothing new. This book may be somewhat good for an outsider not into the black metal scene as to inform about how the scene was started and the goings on of those wacky Norwegians. This book can be interesting at times and at other times is rather tedious. It seems like the authors are just trying to fill in space. But the main downfall of the book is the misleading title of the book. It seems to be less about black metal, but more focused on Heathenism,satanism and facism within the genre, no rise nor fall is indicated in the book. If you are looking for a guide to black metal and wondering what this music is about then you might want to stay away from this book. But if you are in fact interested in the occult, esoteric and violent aspects within the black metal scene, then this mught interest you. All in all this book isnt bad, but it could have been a lot better."
3,"Interesting stuff, lame treatment","Lotsa fun facts about every parent's worst nightmare. Unfortunately, the authors seem to be trying to relive their missed adolescence through the creepy kids' deplorable antics."
4,Easily relatable to every day life.,"Definatly one for those who dress in black. This book explains the actions, thoughts and motives of some of the most evil, unheard of human beings kicking around Europe.Great insight into non-Christian religions in Europe, this book could almost convert the most devout into the most demonic. Chilling. Also, does anyone whose read this see a link between some of the actions in the book and the recent London bombings?? Think about it. 666."
3,"""...the FALL of the satanic metal underground...""","Throughout this book, the author is constantly trying to make it clear how intelligent he is & how many big words he can use in a single sentence. The book is entitled ""The Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground"", but for anyone who has known about Black Metal for more than a year will surely agree that this book marks the ""Fall"" of the Satanic Metal Underground. Complete with book signing across the country & everything! Throughout a large portion of Lords of Chaos, I get the impression that the author is just trying to take up space. But, I suppose this book has decent insight on the now dead & buried Black Metal scene (to the commercialization of media whores). But still, nothing is stated which hasn't been said before in years of interviews in fanzines, etc. Still a slightly entertaining read (hence, the score of 5)"
4,Finally!,Finally a book that looks at the true nature of a barely understood sub genre of heavy metal. Heavy metal's evil stepchild blazed a bloody horrifying trail in its rise to get out of the closet. The authors delve deeply and accurately into both the social aspects of the music as well as the key events into its history. This is an important read for those who would like to either understand this form of music or are fans of social history. I enjoyed it immeasurably. It is indispensable for fans of black metal.
4,Darkness from The Land of the Midnight Sun,"'Lords of Chaos' is more a loosely strung together series of interviews than a book, yet somehow it works. The authors begin what seems to be a look at youth music in Scandinavia, but the focus changes quite quickly. The book has less to do with music than the rise of neo-Celtic belief in Europe.The music of Burzum, the main band discussed in 'Lords of Chaos', is mostly instrumental and quite haunting. I found their albums right here at amazon.com & ordered 'Daudi Baldrs' after reading the book. The music sounds like something you might hear while gazing into a fire near a snow fed lake at night while wolves' eyes sparkled at your back from beneath darkened firs."
3,This book offers many short poems suitable for blank cards.,"This book offers many short poems suitable for use in blank cards from the store, or ones made from your own computer. For example: I Love You, (No. 1) I love you - I love You - I love you; I could say it in millions of ways, And thus, my hope is that you and I, Will be (lovers/together) for millions of days.Some of the poems are a bit old fashioned, or sing-songey, but there are 60 pages of short poems, plus appendices on how to make your own personalized greeting card, examples of love letters with poem inserts (6), selected love symbols for cards and letters, and an index.by Ms. M. Carlton"
1,"""Poetry"" is hardly how I would describe this trite verse.","Rarely am I so disappointed in a selection from Amazon.com, but the verse in this collection is so trite a second grader could have written it. I wish there had been a review available before I wasted my money. If possible, I would have given this book a rating of 0.Here's a sample of the quality of poetry found within this book. It's from the ""Reconcilliation"" section:""What Can I Say?"" What can I say in my behalf - What words can I employ? To heal the hurt I've caused; To make you smile with joy.Yes, this IS a fair representation of the works in this book. Need I say more, except perhaps, ""SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! You can probably do better on your own!""Sorry, Mr. Movsesian."
1,Terrible,You might get 1 mile from this set of radios. Midland states that they have recieved no calls about the lack of range of these units. Go purchase two cell phones that have free mobile to mobile use. G.I Joe walkie talkies at an adult price.
1,Please DON'T buy a bad instrument for your kid!,"This is not a quality instrument. The metal is too soft, the body doesn't respond well, the tone holes are not up to specs--creating tuning problems between the notes on the horn as well as trying to play in tune with others. If it breaks most music stores won't carry the parts to fix it or won't be able to guarantee their repairs. For crying out loud, it's LIME GREEN! Do you really want to play an instrument that looks like and SOUNDS like SNOT? You get what you pay for! Parents, if you are looking to give your child success, get a QUALITY instrument from a reputeable music store. Otherwise you are setting your child up for failure. Instruments like these are often made in China. With the national coverage on sub-par toys with lead in them and shoddy steel coming from China do you really want to take a chance with something that your child will be putting up to his/her face every day?"
4,good coffee,"The coffee tastes great. The carafe design is strange in that there is no spout. The coffee stays hot for about 2-3 hours if removed from the coffee maker, which is slightly less than some of the glass lined carafes available. Overall good but (...). The gold filter should have been included."
3,The good points/the bad points,"I agree with some of the other reviews in regard to the negatives about this coffeemaker -- lack of spout means you have to be a bit careful when pouring, the coffee doesn't stay hot as long as thermos-type carafe coffemakers I've used and after about 6 mos. of use the handle on mine seems to be somewhat loose. Also, the brewing doesn't stop immediately if I try to pour a cup of coffee mid-brew, but that doesn't matter to me since I don't do that normally but was just testing that function. On the plus side, mine does make really good coffee; all the grounds are completely saturated after brewing;and I don't need to add more coffee than usual, as some people have found. In addition, I like the programmable function and the overall design. All things considered, I probably will look for a less expensive coffeemaker next time around since I don't think this product is worth the high cost."
2,"An Expensive, Cold Cup of Coffee","I'd eyeballed this coffeemaker for several months and finally bought it. While visually attractive, its performance is a huge disappointment. As others have stated, the coffee is not hot enough, even if you pull the carafe off immediately after brewing finishes. I wound up microwaving my coffee to make it drinkable... it was literally close to room temp after I put cream in it! I called Krups to explain that the machine is problematic, and the kind lady said they only received raves about this unit. I guess she hasn't been here or read other online reviews!"
4,Handle fix,After several years the handle of our carafe worked loose. The handle appears to have been attached by an adhesive that degraded over time. We mixed up a little J.B. Weld and applied it carefully to the handle. After reattaching to the carafe we held the handle tight with scotch tape and let it set up overnight. I hope this easy fix is helpful.
1,"Great idea, horrible Quality Control.","Calling out from the cell phone only works from the base station , not the handsets.If anyone were to call the landline and hangup before the answering machine completed the announcement, the phone locks up so the next person who calls can hear you speak but, you can't hear them.Thus, everytime I got robocalled or telemarketed, the phone was locked up until I hit the speaker button.The overseas customer support is pointless as after three rounds of ""and if that doesn't work?"" they told me to ship the unit back.Oddly, the trash can was closer.I bought this unit becasue it had a GE label on it, next time I'll know better."
1,Works great - when it works at all,"If you like repeatedly having callers unable to hear your voice, this is the phone for you. I bought this phone and it consistently drops your voice on both outgoing and incoming calls. This can be fixed, sometimes, by unplugging the phone for several minutes and plugging it back in (after losing all of your settings, etc., etc.). I returned it to GE, they sent me a new one (after FOUR months), and the new phone does the same thing.Very disappointing - especially because when it does work, the Bluetooth connectivity is great and the sound clarity is good. Nice extra features like room-to-room intercom, push-to-talk, and room monitoring. This product has potential, but it was poorly executed."
1,Lot of promise - zero satisfaction!,"I, too have purchased this phone and have had very bad experiences with it. I have had three problems. First is when I receive a call, when I answer the receiver, but have no sound. Second, is where I make a call, but get no dial tone before the phone dials out. Even though I got no dial tone the call went thru. The strangest problem is when the phone decides to call someone on its own. Being connected thru Bluetooth to my cell phone allows this model to just call someone on its own, then ring the GE handset, both parties thinking that they have been called by the other.Dealing with customer service is a total waste. They don't even know the instruction manual and you cannot get to speak to anyone who is familiar with the product itself. Don't buy this product!"
2,GE 6.0 Phone,"This phone works well; however, if you buy additional phones it won't allow you to synch or add them. So I had to buy a whole new base and restart if I wanted to use this phone."
4,No problems here,"I dont know about you guys, but after fully charging the unit, i got no problems whatsoever.I also got this on clearance from wal-mart for 30.00 and so far everythings well.Im keeping the receipt for 90 days just in case.Im replacing a vtech 2.4 ghz just to minimize interference and also mydate-confused answering machine."
4,"Forget the movie soundtrack, buy this!","I own four RHS CDs. This one is second only to the Roxy cast. Individually, the singers on this CD are excellent, possibly the best of any version. But since this cast never performed a show together, it lacked that spark that makes Roxy the best overall. The arrangements are refreshing, particularly in contrast to the movie. Aidan Bell is outstanding as Riff-Raff. O'Brien may have originated the role, but Aidan mastered it. Brian May puts a brand new twist on Meatloaf's Hot Patootie.This CD also holds the distinction of being the most complete. Every song is included and most of the Narrator's dialogue has been added in.This CD, along with the Roxy Cast recording is a must have for any Rocky Horror fan. And if you've never seen the stage show or even heard an RHS cast recording, you don't know what you're missing."
2,Feels Unfinished,"I'm not sure if Joan Bauer is planning another book about Jenna, but it seemed to me from the end of this one that she needs to write one in order to clean things up. Although I loved ""Rules of the Road,"" I didn't find this book nearly as compelling. Jenna was still her strong and determined self, but the supporting characters were a bit bland.Mrs. Gladstone didn't have as much of a presence in this book as she did in the first one. Jenna's love interest was only barely described, as was Tanner, the good-hearted theif who I kept feeling Bauer really wanted to make into Jenna's love interest.This book felt like only half a story, which would make sense if there is a sequel intended, but it is a bit weak as a stand-alone book."
4,Good but the ending,The book was really good up till the last couple of chapters. The ending of this book is dumb. Im pretty sure if Joan Bauer would have kept going on it would have been the best book i have ever read. If i were you do not buy this book. Its way to short amd it doesnt end well.
4,"Accurate, and simple","With so many fussing about how hard it is to understand the whole debate over the different bible versions, this book was a well-written, easily understood synopsis of some of the most important issues on the subject. Taken from a radio interview, this lays out some of the arguments, and is specifically written with the layman in mind. Ms. Riplinger's extensive collation is right on the money, and all those who like to refer to the ""original Greek"", need to realize none of them exist anymore! Read this book prayerfully, and follow it up with ""New Age Bible Versions"" for a complete understanding."
3,"Good content, bad models",I have found this magazine to be fairly good as far as content of the articles and helpful health tips. It does disturb me that the magazine keeps placing skinny models in bathing suits on the front that do not look like they work out consistently but are just very thin. I hope the magazine will read some of these and make a change to some healthier options.
1,Aggressive Marketing,"Wife started a one year subscription which had automatic renewal. Decided that she did not like it so she canceled the automatic renewal. They do not seem to take no for an answer. Did not receive any more issues beyond the initial one year subscription but have been continually getting nasty letters with statements such as ""your debt is now seriously delinquent."" and ""please pay your debt now."" Not sure if this is true for all magazines published Meredith Corporation but don't think we are going to subscribe to any of their magazines. These letters by the way are sent from their ""delinquents account unit."" Letter threatens that they will not resume delivery until payment is received. Can't believe this is their marketing strategy do they think we are idiots?"
4,Guilty pleasure,"This is your typical woman's magazine and it has your typical recycled articles, but it is a fun brainless read. I like the new exercise routines (although they're all basically the same thing month-to-month), and they occasionally have good recipes."
3,Poor circulation department,"Not a bad magazine (Shape is better). I have to agree with several other reviewers when they speak of customer service. It took forever to get my first issue and than I got 3 issues (different months) within 2 weeks. I thought my subscription had expired because I hadn't received April's issue which was already on the supermarket shelf. Five days later, it showed up in my mailbox. I'm going to stick with Shape."
1,Never received it,"I ordered this in February at the end of April I called to find out where it was and the first issue wasn't to arrive until June? That's absurd. I cancelled my order, if that's the kind of customer service then I doubt the other issues would arrive in a timely fashion."
1,mind body and fitness my ass!!!,"This mag is all hype. They don't give you anything other than a bunch of ads of beautiful looking people who lost weight on diet pills and a bunch of girlie advice on what to wear and how to feel and the exersize routines make you look stupid when you try them at the gym. I'm tried of magazines that make you think you won't be happy till you obtain a certain ""dress size""."
2,No Women of Color on the Magazine Covers,"Occasionally when I go to the grocery store I pick up a magazine by the check out counter. So I bought an issue of Fitness magazine and then decided to get a subscription. I don't know what the heck I was thinking. Each time I got the issue I noticed there was always some skinny blond chick on the cover wearing a bikini. There were NEVER any women of color on the cover. So when I was sent a letter, asking if I'd like to renew my subscription, I said he11 no. I'm not wasting my money on a so-called fitness magazine that doesn't feature women of color on its cover. There's just no way. I thought fitness was for everybody, not just for skinny blondes who wear bikinis. And just because your skinny doesn't make you `fit' either. Skip this if possible."
5,Not Quite Chita,"I have both the Broadway and the London cast recording of this musical. This version is excellent, although it does not quite measure up to the incredible Chita Rivera/Liza Minelli duo performance. This version makes many of the scenes clearer through the music. I recommend the Broadway cast, but as it is hard to find, this recording is a close second."
3,"Not as good as the original, but fine nevertheless.","Since the Broadway CD ""The Rink"" is not available, this is the only copy for those loyal Kander and Ebb fans. The woman who plays the mother is very good however the daughter's performance lacks a great deal. Her ""american"" accent is not very good and sounds like a whinny cockneyer. Overall the CD is fun and the male vocals are fine."
1,waste of money just awful,"This is the worst belly dance video on earth. I spent about 18 or 19 dollars or so on this video hoping to actually learn something but this video is just awful. Janine Rabbitt wears this ugly pink tight outfit, keeps her feet wide apart during the whole video, and has her grandma in the video. Ms Rabbitt looks just plain doofy in the whole video. its just AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL I don't mean to sound overly harsh but I spent a lot of money on this video hoping to learn something and I was extremely disappointed. People who can't dance shouldn't try to teach. I wish I could get my money back."
1,pot cleaner,"This product is a ripoff. Each bag of this product can only clean a one qt. pot. A 3 qt. pot requires 3 bags, which amounts to $6 bucks per cleaning. You don't find this out until you get the product and read the instructions."
2,"""The Vaccine Book"" is much better","I loved the ""Natural Pregnancy Book"" by Aviva Jill Romm, and I was excited to see that she had a book on vaccines. However, it's not a very good book. It was clear to me that she was asked to write about something that she didn't really know that well. I found the book kind of confusing, sometimes out of date (a lot of discussion on vaccines that are no longer used), and generally lacking in the details/statistics I wanted. Try ""The Vaccine Book"" by Robert Sears, instead. It's a much better choice. ""The Vaccine Book"" offers the details and actual statistics that this book lacks. The Sears book also offers a nice discussion on the use of animal tissue in making vaccines and a nice discussion on the concerns about aluminum toxicity."
2,This picture is misleading,This product doesnt come with the projector mount. It only comes with the wall mount and the swing arm. You have to order the projector mount separately. Good and sturdy construction though.
4,It ok,"I liked it, but expected more info on the temperament of the race, not just the fisique, that obvious. It has little info on the character of the breed; like it's energy level, likes dislikes, advantages abilities... hoped to read more, buts ok."
1,Sony SRF-M85V S2 - poor design and recepction,"I have been using the Sony Walkman receivers for years, and am familiar with the product. Two major problems with this model:First, setting radio stations with this model (I need the instructions) is much more difficult than in the previous model (intuitive).Second, the reception is horrible."
3,Wanted to replace my Sony Walkman,"This item works pretty well except for one major fault: the volume control is right next to the belt clip, so when you are clipping the radio while you are running, you can't help but hit the volume and blow out your ears."
4,A personal favorite,I bought one of these in 2004. As a person who commutes via public transit in all weather I put it through a lot of abuse.When it finally gave out I had to get another one.I hope this lasts as long as my first one.The TV band is great as well as the AM FM and weather band function.The only down side is the headphones don't have a long life.I highly recomend it.
1,Poor Reception,I also had the model before the M85V and got great reception. This new model gets terrible reception. I still have my old model and put the old one next to the new one and it was like night and day with the reception. Don't waste your money on this model!!
1,Don't buy this product,"I owned the predecessor to this product, the M80V. It provided fine FM reception. That unit came to a bad end and I needed a replacement, so I bought the M85V unit. The FM reception is absolutely worthless. All the other features are great, but if I can't get any reception, they are worthless."
2,Not the best,"I bought this as a replacement for my lost trustySony SRF-M37W Walkman Digital Tuning Weather/FM/AM Stereo Radio (Black), thinking, ""Hey, it's a Sony, should be good."" Hah.First thing, the volume control thumbwheel popped off the back when I unclipped it from my waistband. I only luckily retrieved it, but lost it 3x more until the last instance it was lost forever--so no more volume control except with tweezers.Second, each button push generates a very loud BEEP in the 'phones that cannot be turned down or disabled. This is absolute murder when using noise-canceling headphones, which makes the BEEP even louder.Third, the unit has all these fussy mode switches and functions that are useless for just listening. Hard to remember how set the time and change presets. Reception is okay but susceptible to being overpowered by local stations.Thank goodness I found & bought a newSony SRF-M37W Walkman Digital Tuning Weather/FM/AM Stereo Radio (Black), and I'm back in my Happy Place again."
1,Poor quality and short life,"The problem with this model like most Sony headphones is that the hole where the headphone jack goes into becomes corroded or rusted and after only a few short months sound goes in one ear. This basically means the unit is worthless. With two separate Sony models this has happened. I hoped that by upgrading to this ""sports"" model the problem would be eliminated but it wasn't. Now I am in search for a new FM headset and Sony is not an option."
1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE RECEPTION,"DO NOT BUY THIS RADIO! I had the previous model, and reception was fine, but then it broke, so I went and bought the new model, SRF-M85V, and I get serious reception problems. None of the local radio stations come in without hissing and spurting. I've tried everything: changing the battery, switching the dx feed, changing the headphones. Nothing works. I've even used a cheaper non-SONY radio at the various locations I work out at, and on the cheaper radio, guess what: Reception comes in FINE! I called Sony, and they refused to accept my feedback via email. They wrote me an email back, offering me a reconditioned radio (but I'd have to pay shipping), and refusing to forward my feedback on to the engineers responsible for the SRF-M85V. It is obvious to me that SONY does not care in the slightest about quality assurance. Trust me. DO NOT BUY THIS RADIO."
1,Facts... I'll tell you only facts....,"Ok class.... I went out and purchased this radio knowing I was going against the reviews. I work night shift and use different headsets. I've heard people at work talking about Sony and how great they are but they weren't referring any certain one. I bought this one and it's terrible. Out of all the headsets I've had, this one gets no reception but static. I can hear the station in the background but there is so much static, it's annoying. I know the difference between DX and Local so I've switched and tried so many different things and nothing works. What others say about this is accurate. This headset would be good if you take it to the gym and toon into one of the televisions while working out.... that's it. My recommendation is thumbs down on this one."
5,simply perfect,"The Perfect Cocktail has been the most helpful guide that I have used in my 5 yr. of bartending. It is a simple breakdown of the making and selling of drinks. It is perfect for a basic tavern because the ingredients are basic, while other guides consist of recipes/products that would be more likely to be called for/in stock at a more formal establishment. The best tip I've gotten from this book is not to wad up my tips, to lay them flat to save time counting ."
4,Nice wall mount,"Product was easy to mount to wall, easy to attach to tv, and simple enough to put the 2 parts together!"
4,"Tilting Wall Mount, 40"" Sony LCD","The wall mount works well and is easy to install. It supports my 40"" TV easily with the mount fastened to two wood wall studs. It was less expensive than similar alternatives, which is good, but all of the available mounts seem to be overpriced so I didn't quite ""love"" this product."
5,Great Mount,bought this wall mount from amazon which was about less than half the price at a retail store. i mounted a 32 inch lcd pretty much by myself in less than 20 mins. setup was a snap. great product.
4,good mount,"stable mount. could use a built in bubble level. Nice website that enables you to locate your tv model and then type in how high you want your tv using either the top or the bottom of the tv. Then it spits out the exact distances for the pilot holes for the screws to be mounted. This took about 30 minutes to install. I found that the snap down locking hooks didn't grip really tight but they don't need to be that tight I guess. It sure isn't sloppy loose on the mount, just a little bit loose."
4,"Jinnel, I'm With-With-With You.","If you like Robin Fox(""I See Stars""and""It's Gonna Be O.K."") or Diana Fox(""Running On Empty""), then this song is for you. It has the same heavenly vocoded-vocals and tight beats. The lyrics are also really strong, although the With-With-With You's can become kind of repetetive. You get a good bit of remixes on here for the cost. They are all great, but my favorites are the Malicious Mike, Skribble & Anthony Acid, and LD30 mixes. You can also find this hot song on Malicious Mike's own CD ""Anticipation"". If you are from my area, you can checkout DJ Mooch & DJ Crak's CD ""United Breakz of America"" that also includes this song. I would definitely give this single a listen if you are a female-vocal trance/breakbeat fan. If my review was helpful to you, then don't forget to vote. THANKS!"
3,Title is deceptive. Small employers beware.,"The book title suggests help for small organizations, but the blurb inside the front cover says that the book ""provides targeted strategies for companies with as few as 50 employees or as many as 5,000.""If you have fewer than 100 employees you may be disappointed with this book. The biggest focus is on self-funded plans, which the author says are most feasible for organizations with more than 100 employees."
5,Immortelles,"This was recommended to me by a former neighbor, John, who perhaps is the ""John"" because of whom the book was written. He was next door neighbor and good friend to ""Mimi,"" who wrote Immortelles. I purchased this book for my mother, who had time to read it. She was very happy with the story and summed it up with ""charming,"" ""fascinating,"" and ""she was an ordinary French woman who made the mistake of marrying a German during WW2"". Now my mother wants to visit the little white house in which Mimi lived."
2,Motor shot at the second use,"I bought this blower/vacuum end of last year based onthe positive comments here. I didn't used it until this fall.However, 15 minutes into my second use as a blower, I smelledburing and when I stopped it, smoke came out of the motor andthat's the end of my leave blowing season.Glad it has a two year warranty. How I have to figure outhow to get it repaired. And I own a Toro lawnmower and agas trimmer! Guess the luck caught up with me this time."
2,The Magnesium Impeller...,"The Magnesium Impeller will, by the way fit on the 51591...so if you ordered this model...upgrade early. I lost my plastic blade to a freakin acorn...couple weeks project interruption."
4,It's a nice piece of lawn-gear,"I bought one of these things and it's a great piece of equipment, but it does have a few week points.It really moves leaves,no doubt,and I love the mulching feature. The only problem I've encounterd is, the impeller is plastic. I'm afraid it'll break off a blade and get's hung up on pinecones,and we have alot of them in eastern Virginia. It also doesn't do too well on some twigs that get caught up in the intake. the bag is a little akward for me to use. But the vacume feature works great in the corners that you can never seem to get all the leaves out of and chops them up nicely.Getting the bag empty is pretty easy and I would reccomend this blower. On the cool scale, it rates a 10."
4,meets expectations,"I have not used the vacuum function yet but the blower works great. Only negative is there should be one more speed which would be lower. Sometimes the lowest speed is still too powerful. So far, I recommend this unit."
4,100' extension cord is heavy!,It works great. Downside is I need a 100' extension cord to reach to the edge of my yard. I found after a while that it is a pain to get out a 100' cord and especially to put it away again.
5,Works like a charm,I purchased this to replace the originals that came with my mower after the bag wore out after many years of use. Works like a charm.
5,Ancient Christianity,Highly recommend for people interested in knowledge about the Christian Orthodox faith and ancient Christianity. Most people in the west are not aware of the existence of Christian faith before Luther and outside Roman Catholic faith. Eastern Orthodoxy is very different from current Christianity. This.book portrays Orthodox spirituality. It also divulges some of the politics of the times.
3,FUN 2-D GAME,"If you can find it buy it(...and is an excellent 2-D side scrolling game. You assume the role of an ancient ninja that has been betryed by another klan who has taken a certain family hostage and you seek revenge. This game has got it all awesome detailed 2-d graphics,realtime digitalized backgrounds that are interactive(yes you can destroy almost any background on the screen,trees,limbs,signs,doors etc) the sound is great too,with a great fitting soundtrack to the sound ninja stars,to swords clanging. The game has 8 or 9 levels I believe and is a challenge but not immpossible,plus it has a level code if you must. GREAT SEGA SATURN GAME,A CLASSIC,DECENT STORY AND GAMEPLAY"
1,Not worth the prize,"I ordered this book based on the publishers review and have to say that I was disappointed to the degree that I returned it. The illustrations are poor in detail and quality, especially for a book supposedly centered on anatomy. There are a lot of other books that describe the anatomy of this region in greater detail, without being anatomic atlases. Sorry, but this book isn't worth the money!"
5,Terrific US Flag,"Sent as a gift, arrived way earlier than advertised. Love it. Looks great on my sisters house."
3,Nice American Flag on Crooked Chinese Pole,"The flag is sewn nicely, but of thinner nylon than expected. The tag is not a big problem as some reviewers complain. Just pull the tag off, it's paper and sewn into a seam. The pole is really sad, it's two piece and the pieces dont fit together very well. Valley Forge should be embarrassed by the pole and bracket, which were made in China. I suggest buying the flag individually (see other Valley Forge products link by item title) and getting a decent pole."
5,Very Pleased,"I am very pleased with the shipping service....free....I wasn't sure I would have it by July 4th. But, it came in plenty of time. The quality seems fine. I'll know more after it is flying for a month or so. There are only 2 positions for flag pole to fit into, not as stated. The embroidered stars are very nice. Almost gives a 3D effect."
1,the price is to high,I love star trek but buy the movies seperate from amazon and it will save a lot of money. this should be a lot cheaper.
4,"Warp speed, Mr. Sulu...","As a big fan of all things Trek, I was waiting for this item to show up. The addition of commentaries and behind the scenes featurettes is easily the best thing about DVDs. These original Treks provide great insight into not only the movie making process, but the history of Star Trek in general. I admit to being spoiled by the ""play all"" feature of the Lord of the Rings Special Editions, so I found the constant menu surfing a bit tedious. But, all in all, these are great!"
3,"OK, but not great","The color is very pretty, the seed beads are fine, but the larger beads look a bit cheap. Wearing this necklace with another one may improve the overall look. For the price, it at least adds a bit of color to an everyday, running around sort of outfit."
3,It's not a Lehane Book,"I you're searching Lehane books, this is not a Lehane book! Unclear listing by Amazon. Lehane: Good! Final Confession Fair."
5,Greatly Enjoyed It!,"This is a wonderful recording - not only from a musical standpoint (very talented voices), but I was so excited to find this sung in ENGLISH!! I know, some probably think that it takes away from the original, but I like to understand what I am listening to!"
4,Dana Delaney is Teriffic,"This series about a Philadelphia Medical Examiner solving crimes is nothing new: we've had this type of plot since ""Quincy, M.E."" What makes this show special is the beautiful, talented and charismatic Dana Delaney,who makes this show an absolute pleasure to watch. The rest of the cast is okay. Jeri Ryan is suitably sexy as her boss. Everytime I look at Ryan, I think of the inept and pathetic individual currently in the White House. Not sure what I'm talking about? Read Ann Coulter's ""Guilty,"" pages 142-148 and you will see what I mean.The look and feel of this show is similar to ABC's other entertaining crime drama ""Castle.""In conclusion, ""Body Of Proof"" would be just another average, while enjoyable, crime drama. However, the wonderful Dana Delaney moves it out of the average category to the downright entertaining. Watch it and see for yourself."
5,Just the Facts Pt. 2,"What a wonderful book. Not only will you learn more than you'd ever need to know, but you can chuckle right along with the author as he puts his 2 cents in. Wanna find out once and for all what the average size of a penis is? Do you have any idea what oculolinctus is? I dare ya to find out. Thank me later!"
1,WOW...,"i ordered the Skullcandy SC-BTi Ti Stereo Headphones - Blackand they sent me the Skullcandy Ti Stereo Headphones - Black (Fur Earpads).not only is there a price difference but the style of the headphones are completely different.the ones i wanted were black and gold, and i got the ones that are black and silver with fur.i dont like them,it wasnt what i ordered,and i am unsatisfied about how they handled it.i called them and told them about the situation.they said i could send it back in but i would have to pay a restocking fee for their mess-up. i have just recently started trying online shopping and i know for sure that i will never buy from them again for ripping me off and sending me the wrong product."
5,We'll be waiting for yoooooooooou!,"I will only tell you this, you have to like comedy that deals with uncomfortable situations! For people who don't take much serious!"
2,Adult Swim's Lean Years,I'm wondering what enticed Turner to continue to run this show. I guess people watched it? Or maybe the writers are relatives to the corporate exec's? It's laugh out loud funny never. Maybe they kept it on the air to make some of the other weak entries look funnier? It's all beyond my grasp of simple reasoning I guess. I think I kind of liked one episode with a outdoor concert by a dam that burst so I'll give it an extra star. 2 of 5.
1,Alternative comedy?,"Yes, it is indeed the alternative to comedy in that it is not at all funny. If you enjoy junior-high school play-level acting, aggressively bad and self-conscious mugging for the camera, and the deliberate, drawn-out, and belabored mispronunciation of words without context, then this is the show for you. Oh, the hilarity! The proof of this show's vacuousness is that none of its supporters will ever be able to tell you WHY any of it is supposed to be funny. If pre-meditated amateurism is your cup of tea, then this is the show for you."
5,Great buy!,This was a great buy for a great price. You couldn't possibly find a better buy. Your kids will love it. Great job!
1,Crap,"I originaly bought this item to up grade to the usb feature to the 2.0 standard. It was an easy instal but once I started hooking items up to the unit it stop functioningand it some how corrupts my files on my external hard drive. In conclusion dont buy this item, this item doesnt work, it may freeze you computer, and even the updated drivers wont make this item function properly."
3,simplicty and thought,I thought it was very interesting it was of thought and simplicity it had lots of interseting perspectives about one's own life....
3,Not bad,Okay so Uforia isn't the album of the year but I think that the Brighton fan is being a bit harsh... Uforia does lack the verve of the previous album (for whom the bell) but if nobody experimented no musical progress would ever get made. I think that this is a brave album and it has some really good elements to it such as the production for a start.
5,Tedman,"Just received DVD today and have watched twice already tonight at work. This music takes me back to a better time and a better place. Makes me happy to remember the good ole days. If only more episodes where available, all would be right. Thank you for the wonderful memories."
1,Complete Misrepresentation,"I fall into the category of ""customers with reading comprehension screwed over by this vendor"". I don't see how Amazon can't do anything about this. I received one pen light and it obviously says ""6 pk"". I think the best part is the pen light box has a sticker from the shipper on it that reads ""6 pk"". Nice touch. Don't buy this, it's a total lie and this product should be removed by Amazon."
2,Penlight,"One of them didn't work very well out of the pack of 6, but other than that the rest of them work great."
1,Stay away,"I wished I had read the reviews before I made this purchase. Item is misrepresented, you DO NOT GET A 6/PK as advertised, you only get 1 and it's not worth the each price. Buy from this vendor and you will be dissatisfied."
1,Not as Advertised,"This penlight is being advertised as a 6 pack, which is a lie. Only one pen comes in the package. There are better quality lights out there for the price. I would return if it wasn't such a pain for something so small. Do not purchase."
2,A not user friendly boxing game,"I wish I knew of other better Sega Saturn boxing games my sons and I could play, for this one hardly gets played due to its uneasy manuverability in the ring. In short, this game so far is boring. We have had it for three months now and it still is just : ""Boring"". Don't waste your time or money, buy something else. Also the graphics are not good as compared to Sega Saturns ""Wipe Out""."
4,good set,"This seat is lightweight, easy to move from car to car. I wouldn't take on a long trip, it doesn't seem near as secure as the 5 point but I guess that's why it's a booster. My 3 year old loves the cup holders!"
4,Price is right for this seat!,"You can't go wrong with this seat. I paid $39.99 (I wish more people would also post what they paid since Amazon's prices change and it doesn't help when people say ""it's worth the money"") - how much? Anyway, for $39.99, you can't go wrong. My kid loves the cup holders on each side along with a little holder for his hot wheels. The colors of this chair are neutral enough and I liked that. The only reason I give it a 4 star rating is because the plastic cup holders don't slide out very smoothly, but what do you expect from a booster seat? It's functional. It's not a Lexus Booster Seat. :)"
3,booster seat,This seemed to fit the purpose... Good for my 4 year old... The plastic seemed alittle flimsy. but it definately worked. Price was right too. No complaints.
2,Returning the seat,"I got this seat for my second child after reading the reviews and trying to save a little money over the Graco brand. I found that the seat does not compare to Graco whatsoever, the plastic seems thinner, all the parts kind of wiggle and the head-rest if useless, my little one's head pushes past it when she falls asleep and goes completely sideways. That makes me think seriously about safety. Graco does not have that issue and to make sure it was the chair and not my little one's heave head :) I made her use her big sister's booster seat and she did not have that kind of issues on it. Also, once the child seats, the side trays cannot be opened without adult help (and it is even hard for me to do it). I am returning this Evenflo and shopping for a Graco today and happily paying the difference for safety and comfort's sake."
4,Personality...and terror.,"This book was too short. I have to say that's why I'm knocking off a star from my rating, though I'm aware of how difficult the process of collecting true ghost stories can be.Regardless, this book has a lot of personality; that of the author especially, who brings out the personalities of those telling the stories and thereby even the personalities of the ghosts themselves.I give most of the credit to the more firsthand, ""contemporary"" stories in this book, rather than the more historically-based stories, simply because they are some of the most unique and the most TERRIFYING I have ever read. Previous reviewers have been more thorough in describing the range of stories in this book, but trust me, the people who relayed their experiences firsthand to the author conveyed something that history cannot... Fear. I'll leave it at that.Boston, one of Americas first metropolises, MUST have more stories than this...and I'm patiently waiting for them to come forward."
3,Cool for lyric fans,"the music is a lil' over done and loud for my taste, but this is a reaaly good lyrical album. Fans of literary songwriting and lyrics will enjoy this one. the only minus here is that the music is more agressive than it needs to be and sometimes overcomes some very interesting writing and ideas. For new stuff tho this is very well done!"
1,Oh My..,"This CD SUCKED!!! Oh my god..I love MCR, but..wow! The music, and lyrics in this was alright, but the singing, SUCKED! Don't get it! It's a waste of MONEY!! Trust me, I know, I bought it!!"
1,What has happened to music?,"So I guess every band like this gets a record deal ever since Thursday got big. We don't need another band like this!! Do something new, or if you're in My Chemical Romance, save the world from this horrible music and break up. That would make my day."
5,"Amazing, whatelse can I say?","This is an incredable cd, honestly that is simply all it is. This band lovingly puts so much energy and emotion in this that I don't think that there is a single generic or feigned part on the whole cd. A expert mix of hardcore, emo and punk the way it should be played and enjoyed. My Chemical Romance expertly balances these three genres while playing memorable songs with great lyrics. Has a sorta goth feel to it but I am fine with that in this case. I think Drowning Lessons is definatly the best song on the cd. I think these guys could be huge and it is a shame that people are so preoccupied with other flash in the pan acts and not focusing on true talent. Relentless and passioned songs, this cd kills.p.s. Man now I know what they mean when they say ""be careful what you wish for."""
3,Herd There First Album They Made!,Herd the first album they made was good but not as good as there 2nd they still rock though!Liked:1.)Vampires Will Never Hurt You2.)Early Sunsets Over Monroeville
4,these guys,"alright all you kids that think you know what youre talking about, mcr is really a great band but not as good as their hype makes them out to be. they have a very original style, taking sort of old AFI dark punk style mixing it with some modern emocore, and the results arent bad at all. yes mcr did just get signed to reprise as a result of thursday blowing up, and that will prbably ruin the integrity this band has, so enjoy this album, it will probably be their best. my favorite songs on this are Vampires will never hurt you, demolition lovers, and early sunsets over monroeville, which is really one of the best songs ive heard in a longggg time.if youre lookin for a different style on this whole emo punk thing, get this cd, if youre sick of it like alot of people are, stay away."
5,A Classic Metalcore Gem!,"I recently purchased this off of Amazon to recollect it. I actually had this CD once before, clear back around when it was released, but something happened to it along the way and I wasn't sure where it went. I finally just decided to break down and get another copy off Amazon, because it's really a pretty dang good CD. I never really much cared for their follow up album, I Lucifer, spare maybe a couple of tracks, but overall this one is pretty awesome and I love it!"
4,Pretty Good,"It isn't very original but I thought it was very well done. I normally don't write reviews but I saw that that it was only reviewed by 2 people with an average of 2 stars. I think this album is much better than just 2 stars. I think the album sounds very good. My favorite songs are ""Pallbearer"" and ""Saints"". I think you should give this album a chance if you do like metalcore and aren't an incredibly biased douche who hates anything related to metalcore. Reminds me a lot of Bullet for My Valentine for some reason."
4,Andy will live on..,"This film is a unique reexamination of Andy Warhol. It weaves the major events of the avant-garde icon's life into a fictional musical. Wildly famous as the creator of pop art, an innovative filmmaker and a flamboyant celebrity, Warhol lived his life as a giant piece of performance art. Interviews with Warhol and members of his entourage -- including Karl Lagerfeld and Warhol's brother -- shed light on the legacy of the legendary artist. Not one of the best documentaries but still a must see!"
5,My eyes feel instantly better .,"The glasses fit well over any other perscription eye wear , look nice, good eye protection ony bad thing I keep loosing them and have to buy another pair ."
3,"Good on convoys, bad on details","Woodman who is an ex-merchant seaman does very well on the story of the convoys as they plied there way to and from Malta during World War II. In this he is good and the book has real value. This includes interviews with some of the surviving sailors of these convoys.However he essentially uses no German or Italian source material and has a great number of errors of detail. Nor does he use recent academic books in English filled with new information. For example, he has the wrong Italian general capturing Addis Ababa in the war with Ethiopia, he confuses hellcat with wildcat fighters (used on British carriers), he talks about lightly armored Italian heavy cruisers when four of their seven were one of the most heavily armored heavy cruisers in 1939 (the Zara class), and he is in error on Axis losses and Axis commanders and confuses bomb sizes. The list goes on. Written so long after the war he should have gotten the details better."
2,14 dollars off a 21 dollar case? too good to be true?,I sent in the UPC's and documentation then they claimed they were invalid...only after threatening did I receive one check - but not the other (i bought two). Google it...a lot of other people have had this problem. Also check the BBB for their area - several complaints have been filed.
5,can't beat the price,"Since my CD collection has basically sat and gathered dust since i got my i-pod last year, this was great just because i knew it would store all my discs in a safe place, all in one case, for the day my computer or itunes files crash. for sitting in a dark corner of my closet, this item worked for me, and i think the sturdy outer layer makes me know my discs will be safe if the case falls off a shelf."
2,Not Recommended,"I convinced myself that it probably wouldn't make any difference whether I got a CASE LOGIC case, or just any old brand. Well, I made the mistake of getting this XTREME case and now I have a case I don't really want to use.A couople of the plastic sleeves have actually torn while I have been very gentle with this case. Every sleeve has a small plastic mini-sleeve on top to keep your discs from sliding out. But what's the point when it scratches your discs when you're trying to get them in or out? If you're using CD-Rs or DVD-Rs you probably don't want this case since those discs are very susceptible to scratches. I ended up cutting all of those tops off...and that was a pain.Other than this, the case holds a lot, has a very nice outside, and a high-quality zipper. If you keep your discs in there, and aren't always taking them in or out then this case will offer some great protection. Otherwise, I can't see the point of buying this case over a CASE LOGIC or another superior brand."
5,Great way to begin your affair with the car.,"Great book---loved the photos! Whenever you're ready to see them up close and personal you'll need1000 Historic Automobile Sites, listing all the great car museums, collections and other neat places to go to see great cars in person and learn more about them. They're listed by state and country... 1000 in all! With an active table of contents, you can use it on your phone or kindle in the car and it lists addresses, telephone numbers, hours and is live linked to their websites so it helps you get there too."
5,Great light for shops or garage,Had to replace my 2 door garage light with this lithonia and love the lighting now. It came a little beat up during shipping such as the lens and the end frame was bent. But no need to picky because it's just a light for the garage and the price was the lowest out there for an F40 2 lamp.Lighting is great and the fixture is durable. I recommend this item for anyone interested in placing it in the garage or small shop.
1,Complete JUNK!!,"I ordered a set of these from Amazon (Goodmans)last August and when I first put them in my shaver they seemed to cut well (a little better than my 15 year old blades), but their performance degraded rapidly. Upon recent closer inspection comparing these blades to the original blades that I kept, it is obvious that these are a cheap knockoff!! The whole lift & Cut blade system is missing where each blade is supposed to have a second blade that performs the lifting cut. Anyway, less then a year later these blades hardly cut anymore (SERIOUSLY, they hardly cut!!). I replaced these junk blades with the old blades that I still have that are more then 15 years old (Boy what an improvement). First and Last items that I ever buy from Goodman's!!"
5,Electric Shaver is like new!,"Works great, I replaced the old shaver heads with these and now the shaver works like when I first got it!"
5,Jolly Rancher-The best suckers in the world!,Everyone must try these! They are not just for kids! Great flavor and amazing taste...Brought them over to Germany for gifts...All ages..
5,Life-like Dalmation.,My 5 year old nephew love this as a Christmas gift and drags it around allover since it is as big as him.
4,Wordplay,"WordplayThis DVD is recommended for crossword puzzle enthusiasts. It's a documentary of the principal players in the crossworld puzzle world, with emphasis on the New York Times puzzle. It covers one of the annual crossword puzzle championships as it unfolds. There is an element of suspense as they proceed through the process to the final round. Footage of the championship is intertwined with interviews with puzzle makers, editors and those who compete in the championship. Also included are interviews with celebrities who do the New York Times crossword on a regular basis. The special features are worth watching."
1,Might work if you have large hands.,I found this tool difficult to use and wonder if it was made for larger hands? The slant seems to go the wrong way when I attempt to pull out weeds with it. Takes more effort than it's worth. This tool will probably be ignored and then finally given to the trash bin.
4,Gift type book of select passages from Conversations w/God,"This is a book of excerpts from various ""Conversations With God"" Series books. There are ten chapters of 'meditations' which includes brief passages on different topics. For example, the 'Mediations on Feelings' contains topics on the subjects of truth, love & fear, grief and anger and etc. The passages vary in length from a few lines to a couple of small paragraphs, and there are black & white pictures adjacent to the passages.This is nice for what it is, which is a gift type book. It's something you could pick up now and again and get a little dose of inspiration, or something to think on. If you have read and liked CWG books, you'll most likely enjoy this."
4,GOOD,"i bought this receiver couple of months ago & had no prombles at all.Actually, this is my best home theatre receiver to date!!"
3,Second chapter,"...BR>Five stars for the XR25, zero for the manual - result 3... Now Zero stars overall.Several months after my initial favorable review, I encountered the same burble problem as other reviewers. It's probably some sort of heat problem not accounted for by the designers, which is why the repair shops can't fix it. Deficient design is usually not fixable. Turning the Rx off and on or switching to another mode usually yields relief for a few minutes at most. This thing has a built in problem. I also have the Panasonic HE100 which is a fine machine - it will also heat your living room on cold days and nights. But it works as advertised and I have had no problems in two years of use."
1,Quality a little suspect,"I have begun having the same problems as some as the other receivers. The sound either drops out or begins ""stuttering"", requiring you to change the input and change it back for the sound to come back. I have had the SA-XR25S for about a year and have finally had it. I am replacing it today with an Onkyo receiver."
1,Cute,Ms. Libaire's writing is awful. But if you like. Po-mo stuff about hot people. Who take drugs and think in fake-Joycean internal monologue. With lots of artificially odd sentence structure. Then you'll like this. It's cute to see people convincing themselves that this book is good.
3,Well Done Little Book,"Optimal Muscle Training is a handy referance book to have around when you are training. Also to check with on various exercises on what is optimal range of those exercises. What is optimal about this book is the dvd that comes with it. Not only are the exercises demostrated, it also gives you a format on what check with and/or for if there is injury. I bought the book used with the dvd, so considering the cost it is well worth it."
4,RediFork,Accurate and easy to use--just push the button amd insert. Better for grilling than oven work.A bit bigger than I would like but not too long-maybe a foot-and it does keep your hand safely away from splattering oil. Very accurate and sturdy.The on and off label has come unglued on mine so I need to reglue it.
2,Works well but don't get it wet,"Bought mine recently and it was great for the first use -- steaks came out beautifully. Then I set it in the sink with a few other grill tools and dishes. That did it in. The sink wasn't full of water or anything, but obviously there was enough moisture exposure to damage it irreparably.Net net, it's way more delicate than it should be. That said, I will probably buy another one (or something very similar) and just care for it more diligently. It's a good investment if you are cooking expensive meat and want to increase the odds of cooking it properly.Note: It doesn't eliminate all the guesswork, as you want to take the temp when you think it's done (so as not to poke lots of holes and let the juices out), and you have to get the probe to the right depth or you could end up measuring the temp of something other than the center."
2,Temp Fork,It's great as a fork to use but the temp guage doesn't do a accurate job at all. We've used it twice and now just as a fork.Sorry I purchased it.
1,Not a good product,"I was pretty excited about this product. Good reviews and I figured I was getting a good thermometer at a reasonable price. Well, a number of BBQ's and steaks later and the thing went into the garbage tonight. I simply cannot waste good quality meat on a thermometer that cannot properly register temperatures within 2-5 degrees. Wasted 4 nice chickens during the SuperBowl. Off to find a new product tonight."
4,Great space save,"Delivery was great. It's just what I needed. Hides away inside my cabinet. Hides my curling iron, dryer and cords. No more having iton the bathroom counter. Wonderful space saver. I recommend."
3,Handy store-well,"If you dont look for really classy features, this one can hold as promised 320 DVDs/CDs. It is good for those who want to have all their stuff at a place easy to leaf through."
1,Poor quality,"I had to return this product. I was attracted to the price initially and received the order. But I decided to return the item as the quality is very poor. CD sleeves are good but the external casing, the zip are totally of low quality. Don't go for these as they are low priced. Go for caselogic and you won't be disappointed."
2,Poorly Made - defective when delivered,"This is a case that came with a jammed zipper, which clearly was known when it was packaged. It holds CD's adequately and has the full claimed capacity. Mine did not smell as others have reported. Beware of the poor quality control. It was worth the $6.99 I paid, if they ever send the rebate, which I have not yet received. The zipper partially closes and that is enough for my purposes."
1,Very Bad Shipping by Amazon.com!,I placed my order on March 3rd and it is not shipped till today(March-14th). This is very disgusting!and I dont know How long will Amazon take to post this review.Bad service Amazon!! Very Bad!!I am Disappointed!!
1,not a good buy,"first, it won't open fully, and you need to force it to keep it open. second, it had not even been a week when one of the two packs tore off. by pack im referring to things you put the cd's in."
2,Do Research First,"My Take: I bought this massive media wallet because it was one of the least expensive ones with a capacity of 320. However, after using it I have to say that there are a few reasons that it is priced significantly less. The plastic interior ""shell"" tends to come out when opened. This could possibly be attributed to the sheer size of the binder. However, my primary complaint is that the wallet zipper is subpar. For this, there is no excuse. Namely, I encounter alot of resistance when I zip and unzip. This lousy feature made the difference between a bargain and a rip off. On the upside it does have a durable plastic cover, but this less functional apsect is overshadowed by a con like a flawed zipper, which is used constantly.My Advice: Think twice before purchasing this binder and remember that money isn't the only factor."
1,This thing really is a piece of crap,"As others have pointed out the outer cover appears sturdy, however once you load the inserts with disc the thing comes apart. There is a crappy little thread line that holds the inserts in and it ripped out first thing. I agree that it is good for storing disk in the back of a closet but now for everyday use, especially with kids who abuse everything you have anyway. Guess you get what you pay for, eh?"
1,Fair,"The zipper came off track the first week. I was unable to get it back on track. Otherwise, it has lots of space. I just can't close it."
1,Real NOT working Walkie Talkies,"I, too, am sorry that I didn't read the reviews. My daughter is very disappointed with this toy. All you hear is static unless she's in the same room as the other walkie talkie. I ended up buying a motorola pair for $20 that works wonderfully! Don't waste your money!"
4,Among the Best Cop Shows Ever,"I often recommend this show to my friends as it is one of the best written shows currently on the air. It compares favorably with some of the icons of television drama including the best of NYPD Blue, and yes even the venerated Hill Street Blues. The stark backdrop of the skeleton of the once-great buildings of Detriot shocked me at first but afterall the city is but a shell of its former self. The acting is solid and the characters are interesting. Imperioli does a great job and should get the nod for an Emmy this fall, although I don't think he will win this year."
1,Poor accuracy,"I purchased this product as a gift, and unfortunately it was my worst purchase of the holiday season. The temperature is not accurate at all, and is 10-30 degrees off when tested in various types of meat.I don't know if the unit is bad, the probe is bad, or what is wrong with it but it's completely useless when it comes to preparing food."
5,Thermometer,"We received this as gift last year, we love it & use it all the time. Purchased for a gift for someone else this year! A must have!"
3,100 foot range?,"I bought this thermometer for my outdoor smoker. However, if you get the recieving unit too far away form the probe it will not funtion properly. 100' range is an over estimation if you plan on keeping the probe outside, and the reciever inside. I would say maybe a 50' range if you are indoor/outdoor. If you were grilling outdoors and were staying within the 100' range outside, you would probably be okay. Also, if you were using it inside cooking with the stove and kept the reciever indoors as well, the range is acceptable. I do like how there is a digital readout on the probe unit as well, so if you are moving around indoors/outdoors, you can see the temp at either unit(provided it is in range). Temperature accuracy is very good."
2,"Good meter, remote sucks","I bought this specifically so I could monitor the temp from inside my house. Well, as soon as I go around the corner of my house walking from the BBQ to the kitchen it loses reception. If I'm not line of sight from the transmitter, I get no signal. I don't know if the transmitter is too weak or the receiver has poor sensitivity, but the range of communication is very poor."
2,PUT CHILD IN SEAT BEFORE YOU BUY,I HAVE THE DISCOVERY HIGH CHAIR. IT DOES NOT SIT UPRIGHT ENOUGH AND THE TRAY IS UP TO HIGH. WE HARDLY USE IT FOR THESE REASONS.
4,Stamina InStride Plus Electronic Stepper,"This product is great! Very compact and easy to store, and the electronic step and calorie counter is a great help. The elastic bands take a while to get used to - I find that I just use my 5 pound weights instead. Overall, I recommend the stepper for someone who just doesn't want to get a big exercise machine."
3,"Decent workout, but no setting for resistance","I like this stepper because it is easy to move around. I placed it behind my couch, where I spend most of my time. :) It seems to be a bit on the tight side, and what I would change is having some way to set a resistance."
4,Just what it claims to be,"Set up took five minuets. I would put it next to a wall for balance. It take a couple of times to get the feel of it. After that, it is a good approximation of stair climbing."
2,Not all that heavy duty,I bought this to do some dog bowl coffee roasting. It's pretty thin ans light. Maybe 2mm? I have oxo kitchen bowls that are more heavy duty.
3,"Returned to Amazon, Bought Durapet at Walmart","I purchased two of these ""Indipet"" 2 qt. bowls from Amazon. I found the bowls to be slightly pitted (on one), fairly thin (not Extra Heavy Duty as advertised), and not completely flat on the bottom. They would have served the purpose of feeding and watering my dog, but I felt that for the price, and the advertised claims, they should have been better quality. I would also mention that there is no skid proof material on the bottom.I found 2 qt. ""Durapet"" bowls at Walmart (also available on Amazon) for the same price. They were better quality with a skid proof bottom. (No foul smell from the rubber ring on the bottom as some have mentioned) Some buyers complain that the labels on all these pet bowls are hard to get off, but there is a product called ""Goo Gone"" (available at hardware stores) that takes the stickum right off with a little rubbing. Kudos to Amazon for making it so easy to return unwanted items; that's why I keep shopping here!"
5,gaining respect from your horse.,"We are very happy with this dvd. We love learning from Clinton, we get as much out of clinton as with buck."
3,Why the omissions??,"While this is a great collection of soul oldies, there are 3 glaring omissions from the DVD soundtrack that are unfathomable, and result in my 3 star rating.First and formost--why on Earth would the classic ""Oh Happy Day"" (from Edwin Hawkins) be left off the CD? It was one of the defining sounds of the era and is a classic not otherwise available on most collections of the time.My other 2 personal favorites were the 2 tracks by the seriously underrated band headed by Robin Trower, who did not deserve to be dissed by the CD editors by leaving them out.The tracks included on the CD are readily available elsewhere and are among the most played on Oldies Radio--this CD would have been lifted from the mundane to the exceptional had those other 3 tracks from the movie been included."
4,Sturdy and functional,"No issues at all with this product - functions as a flashlight should, and made well. Our daughter really likes how it whistles as well. It's not a blasting kind of whistle, so it's bearable and still fun for her."
5,GREAT!,I purchased this flashlight for my grandson. It is his best toy ever!He loves it and carries it with him all over! Even to bed!!
3,thomas the train flashlight,The flashlight is fun for my son but it was not durable. It stopped working less than a week after we got it.
5,My kids have enjoyed this for years,"I got this for my oldest son 4-5 years ago. He, our next child, and our youngest child, now 2yrs old, all have used this for everything for play around the house to use on camping trips. That is durable in my opinion! There is whistle at one end too."
3,Stocking Stuffer,"I purchased this flashlight as a stocking stuffer for my 5 year old Thomas Lover. Be sure to pick up 2 C batteries to include. My son was rather disappointed because I forgot to purchase the batters. However, the case does not seem to be cheap. But I don't expect it to last as long as the other flashlights."
1,Dreadful,"My disgust with this book is not its gossipy nature or its interest in Grant's sexuality. I loathe this book because the authors seem incapable of getting the basic facts straight. Statements of fact -- rather obvious things like the year of Grant's first visit to America -- are contradicted within the space of a few pages. Did these guys read each other's work? The whole thing is just a stupid, stupid mess. The authors should be beaten and their editor should be shot.The only book I've ever thrown in the trash."
1,A Dissappointment,This book is a dissappointment to say the least! With very little basis in any fact the book is presented negativly by the authors. Has a good title but is weak from beginning to to end.
4,Candy Thermometer,"I wanted a digital candy thermometer and decided now was the time to do it...I have had the old style that is like a big tube that goes on the side of the pan, and found that it was difficult to read at times...I was hoping this one would be better...Well I was a little disappointed...I thought the face would be lit..guess I didn't read the ad well enough...It fits well on the pan but seems to be a little top heavy...It does clean up well and stores nicely in the drawer...I don't worry about the big glass tube getting broke with this digital thermometer...I don't know if there are any digital ones out there that beep when the temp is where you want it but that would be nice...For the price this one works pretty good...I found my best deal once again on Amazon.com...I am an avid computer shopper..."
1,"If it can't accurately read the temperature, it's not much of a thermometer","I purchased this thermometer to replace my existing analog thermometer. During the holidays, I make many different candies and was looking for a more convenient way to get an accurate reading of hard crack versus soft ball stage. Being very cautious, I decided to use both the old mercury thermometer and the new digital one on the first few batches and the readings NEVER matched up, with the digital being somewhere between 15 degrees cooler or 15 degrees hotter than the analog thermometer. Obviously, this is a HUGE problem. I'll be returning the thermometer to Amazon.My 2 cents: don't buy this thermometer."
1,Waste of Money!,"Sorry, but this one was a waste of good money for me. Used it for my candy and it never did register the proper ""soft ball"" temp. I knew I'd overcooked my candy and just gave up on it. It's sitting in a drawer now and I can't bring myself to toss it but I should.:-( Very disappointed!!!"
4,"Not fusion, but not overly smooth",This has more going for it than others indicate but I agree is in a mellow vein. As smooth jazz it would be a cut above most of what's out there. There are a couple of other nice tracks on this.
2,Gets too hot,"This unit is not great for a single cup of coffee. It will burn a normal cup of coffee in about 30 minutes. If you forget and leave it on it will quickly leave a thin film of burnt coffee on the top. It is better for a small pot of coffee than a cup of coffee. It would be better if if had three settings; one for low, medium or high."
5,If you want your coffee hot this rocks !,"Thought this was a little ""pricey"" until I tried it. Over the past 5 years have used the different coffe cup warmers with lousy results. The only difference between this and the others is this unit WORKS. You get a three year warranty and it is well built."
4,Basic book on asthma,"These days much of the information is on the computer. The one thing about buying a book is that it saves surfing time, but I found more info I needed on the netThe book is good IF you are looking to learn about asthma"
2,not very good,These are not very good at all. The Balance Bare bars are much better. I'm going to try to give away the rest of my box of these.
5,the taste definitely grows on you!,"I was hoping these would be more of a food item, as opposed to a candy item, but I found that they don't hyper me up as regular candy does, so they suit my needs well while tasting like a candy bar. If there were any variety of this foodbar that was like carrot cake, it would help my consience even more......"
3,stamina folding stepper,"I like this product but it is of a cheaper form. When I got it and opened the box, the wheel on it fell out in 6 pieces and one of the bases was bent and very hard to get the cap on it. But it works good."
4,No instructions!,"The product arrived well-packed, but minus any assembly or use instructions. While there was fairly minimal assembly required, I would like to know how to use the monitor. The price is very good, and the stepper seems solid and what I wanted. However, instructions would be nice!"
4,Stamina Spacemate/Folding Stepper,"I've found this product to be worth the money so far...I've used it at least 25 times, and it has performed well. I average 30 minutes per workout [2400 steps]and the pistons have held up, but if you go beyond 30 minutes??? I weigh 180lbs. Only time will tell if it will hold up...I've owned other brands and the pistons eventually fail. I think you should get 1 year of trouble free use to be able to call the product ""worth the money"""
3,great before it broke,"The stepper worked well for the first week. Unfortunately, the right piston broke after the first week. Other reviewers described this problem. I only needed the exercise equipment for a few months so for $100 it was worth the gamble. I am still using it, but now it is clumsy and awkward. If you need a temporary exerciser and will not be upset if it breaks, this stepper is a fair deal. Before the stepper broke, it was a good piece of equipment"
2,SCREEN AND SENSOR DO NOT WORK,"I SENT AN EMAIL LAST WEEK OR TWO STATING THAT THE SCREEN AND/OR THE SENSOR IS NOT WORKING CORRECTLY. IT DOES NOT TURN ON AUTOMATICALLY WHEN I START STEPPING, AND THE COUNTER DOES NOT GO UP. THE MACHINE ITSELF IS GREAT, I DONT WANT TO RETURN IT..I JUST WANT THE PART REPLACED THAT IS NOT WORKING CORRECTLY, AND HAVE NOT GOTTEN A RESPONSE. PROBABLY WONT DO BUSINESS WITH AGAIN IF PROBLEM IS NOT CORRECTED."
2,pay for what you get,"I had the folding stepper for four months, but it had come apart. Although it arrived sooner than I expected, I was upset that the right pedal arm detached after only a few days. Also, on the day I received the stepper, there was a component already coming apart and left in the box. Due to too much troubles with the return policy, I decide to keep it. Now it's no longer working after only four months. I wouldn't buy this product again."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bougt this machine because it had a lot of positive reviews and high rating! When i tried it out i was very dissapointed. It didn't even feel like i was working out, even on the highest resistant. It feels like you are not working out, no burn sensation, no nothing! I feel more burn walking up my stairs!"
3,On my second one,"I've purchased this product before so I know what to expect out of it. It works well for a nice cardio workout. However, you must anchor it against a wall (The front of the machine towards the wall) or else it will move as you are using it. Also, eventually the round screws at the base of the stepper that hold the step and bar to the machine(The round part towards the front)will break from wear and tear. It can not be replaced. The step itself will keep sliding off the bar making it unsafe to use. The reason I purchase another one is because I love the folding feature. It's the smallest i've ever seen. It can fit under a bed or behind a door. :)"
4,Good Product So Far,"I got my stepper in the mail about a month ago. So far, it has proven to be a pretty good product. Both me and my husband have used the product without a problem (we weigh 130 and 190 respectively). I love steppers and find that it gives me a similar workout to what I can get at the gym, without traveling. My only complaint is that the steps are on an incline, unlike gym steppers, so sometimes when i finish my workout my feet hurt in odd places. Besides this, it was well worth $120. That's about 2 months of a gym membership, so if it lasts longer than that, it will turn out to be a great value."
5,Best carafe made,"This carafe blows all the others away. As your Mom probably told you ""You get what you pay for"".You will not regret buying this quality item. There is no comparison with other carafes. Think ofthis as a mercedes and all others are volkswagens."
2,Semi Useful,Item works fine but the instructions are a little complicated and it should really have two probes.I am no longer using it because I thought it was outside and there are two probes going in.
3,Strong Bifocals Necessary,"Oh, how I wanted to keep this book. It is beautiful. However, within 10 minutes of reviewing it, I knew it would have to be returned. The font size is about 8 with insets and various other parts even tinier. Very hard on the eyes and too much work to make it worthwhile for me."
5,Best Game Ever,I still play this game all the time. Never gets old. Wish they wouldn't have switched from armies to aliens in the later games. Lots of fun.
5,zero hour,"Of all the RTS's from EA and Westwood , Zero Hour has the most re-play value.There are 3 factions ,US , China , and the GLA ;each with their own campaigns on 3 different levels of play.Now for the replay ,each faction has 3 specialized Generals which you can pit against each other on 3 different levels.Example, the US has a Super weapons general , Air force general an a Laser general . China has a Nuclear , a Tank , an a Infantry general.The GLA has a Toxin , a Camo an a Demo general.The game also has over 45 skirmish maps with 3levels each .When you complete each level you receive a medal either a Bronze ,Sliver ,Gold . You receive one for the most tanks an air crafts create in a single campaign .All in all this Game is worth getting. Word of warning: If your system is higher than XP down load the patch to run it from EA or buy the Command & Conquer ,The first decade.This also has patches."
4,Good product,Well made simple sling and a very fair price. If you want a simple strap you can't go wrong with this product.
5,mandatory !!!!!,i consider this one of the 5 best books i 've read in my life. Christensen brings your hand and take to the deep understanding of the concept of disruption in a practical manner. an outstanding jon
3,Not Free SF Reader,"After leaving, Mavin loses track of her sister, who keeps bird form fora long time. She eventually finds her on another continent, and she hasgone a bit crazy. The whole setup over there is also very different."
1,Confused by link,I was led to this productMaverick ET-8 Electronic Thermometer and Timerthrough a site that lists products Made in USA. It was after receiving the Maverick ET-8 Thermometer and Timer with its Made in China on the packaging that I re-read the general info on the Made in USA site and learned that there are still products included that are NOT made in USA. I would like to see where each product is manufactured as part of the standard listing information on all sites.
1,Works well until it breaks,"I loved this thermometer for the first four times I used it. It let me accurately cooked all the food I used it on. But after four uses, it broke. The display unit works fine, but the temperature probe is broken -- after some research, I found out that it won't resist temperatures over about 200 degrees -- and my grill will get hotter than that. Oh well, I guess you get what you pay for!"
4,good racket for the price,"I was looking for a decent racket in the $50 range. This is a pretty good paddle for the price. Compared to the Carlos Chui, this one is slightly lighter but also has a bit less control."
5,A must for Financial fiction fans,"Hanover Place was the first Michael Thomas novel that I read and it made me fan for life. Financial oriented fiction is an underappreciated subject for writers, but amongst the few Michael Thomas is without a doubt the best. Its the only novel I've found that propels the reader through the evolution of Wall Street at the turn of the 20th century to the modern era. Its the best of Thomas's works and a mainstay in my library."
5,Versatile Case!,"This case has been an essential must-have item for me. I started getting into archery a year ago, so of course I wanted to try out numerous products -- a main one being arrows. This case fits my thin A/C/G arrows all the way to my FatBoy arrows. It also provides you with the option of storing your broadheads in this case.No complaints, have had this product for over a year now and has held up great!"
2,Simple & Fun,"If you are tired of counting stitches and using a mag-glass to see your work then a printed pattern is just for you. It is also the prefect project to take on a trip. This design is lovely and practical too. You can follow the color & design pattern or create your own. It is also a great teaching tool. I will gladly suggest the Kitty Pillowcase to anyone. It is colorful,cute and simple to do."
5,Excellent Book,This book is exactly what I have been looking for. The recipes in this book were used to make dream pillows for lower income children who will give them as presents to their family and friends. The kids love the pillows and I know that the family memeber that gets these will be very happy and the kids made something from scratch and they are very proud that they made these for their family.
1,Loved it... for about a week...,"I've used this machine for a little over a month about 5 times a week. The first two smoothies I made were awesome. It went downhill from there. The spout stopped working, and trying to pour out of the top is a total mess. Then it started sounding extremely loud, making horrible noises, and smelling like it was ready to explode. Tonight the blade fell off. Upon closer inspection, the gears are stripped. I've seen this mentioned in other reviews, so I wasn't surprised. Don't waste your money."
4,Nice book,This book is pretty well written and really help you understand the materials better. This book is pretty well organized and very easy to follow
5,luke and mara make an adorable couple,"This is a great book. Luke and Mara are wonderful together, and 'Union' is a cute story about their wedding. Sometimes the pacing is a bit confusing, but overall a great comic."
4,A good recipe book,"If I were to describe this cookbook in one word it would be: good. The recipes are easy enough and tasty enough, but the ingredients the recipes call for aren't the most common household items. So what that means is I need to plan out the meals in advance and if I need to whip something together this isn't my go-to book, which is what brings it down to good and not great.This book is an excellent gift item and is perfect for someone learning how to cook or someone who doesn't have all day to cook. Although it isn't my favorite cookbook, I'm sure glad I have it. It's a lot of fun and I can't wait to try more recipes!"
5,Reliable recipes requiring little time,"Five of the six recipes I have prepared have been excellent. The one that did not work may have been because I use bleached rather than the unbleached flour called for. Five good meals out of six is a far better track record than I have ever had before. I am a novice who sees value in having home-cooked meals. This is not easy since I work full time and have to travel at times. I find this book very easy to use - can find recipes that are appealing, use a reasonable number of ingredients, and have a prep time of less than an hour - half of which is usually baking time. The one complication with the recipes is that they sometimes call for ingredients not readily available standard grocery stores, such as red lentils or garam masala. This problem can be addressed if you have ready access to a large health or specialty food store. I feel confident that my time will be well spent and that meals will be enjoyable when I use this book."
4,"Good, but maybe not great . . .","Ideally I'd give this cookbook 3.5 stars because I don't think I have made enough of the recipes to really know how good the cookbook is. I love to cook and normally average 90 minutes cooking dinner. I bought the book becuase I enjoy Cook's Illustrated and I wanted to add some quicker meals to my repertoire. I have made five dishes and only one would I not do again (the cinnamon buns that look so tasty on the cover). Another I would modify. Besides the fact that the recipes really do take 60 minutes or less from start to finish, I appreciate that the ingredients lists are basic and fairly short. You don't have to stock your pantry with all sorts of crazy items that you use only once in a while. These are fairly basic recipes--the kind you get the gist of after making once or twice and then add your own embellishments if you are in a creative mood."
4,strong first collection,"Winner of the 1999 Hollis Summers Poetry Prize and 2001 Norma Farber First Book Award, Pelizzon's first collection is one of the stronger first collections i've seen. if she can keep up this quality of work she'll seen be a force in the poetry community."
5,Hard to find Gold!,"If you've ever gotten frustrated with cheap cardboard clipboards, these are for you. And you can even feel ""green"" by the fact that they're made from ""recycled"" aluminum........:-)"
3,nickb,This is OK. I liked the compact and water proof bag but it was not able to hold weight of my laptops and its accessories. The bag was torn from the side near the area where belt hooks within 4 months.
4,Good bag for the price,"Great laptop bag for the price. It holds my ASUS 15.6"" laptop and some. The strap is a little uncomfortable and I can see it causing aches if carried for long amounts of time, but for the price, its great."
3,Where is my BAG AT?,It has been two weeks since i purchased this item and i still have not recieved this. What should i do?
1,Poor Quality Product,The edge seams near the Velcro strap inside the bag will start to tear within 2 months of normal use. DO NOT BUY. Look elsewhere for a laptop bag.
4,Not exactly what I expected... okay for the price,The bag is just okay for the price but not exactly what you have on the picture...The amazon picture is alittle over stated... what you really get is like the customers picture...(less compactment). well it will do the job for me at least. Shipping speed was very good.
1,Not as pictured,"The item I received was not the same as the one pictured. It had an advertising logo on it for insight schools -- stitched VERY prominently on the front of the flap, about 2.5"" x 4"". I returned it, and received the EXACT SAME PRODUCT -- with the logo advertising on the flap -- that was sent the FIRST time. So, TWICE, I was sent the wrong product."
4,Good Product,"The first thing I can say about this product is that shipping was great! I ordered it Friday night and Monday afternoon the product had arrived at my doorstep. The bag is great. Nice, durable material, lots of pockets, a good amount of space...and it holds my 15.4 in Dell Inspiron laptop perfectly. Great buy for the price...I would definitely recommend."
1,do not buy,If it wasnot such a pain I would send this bag back. The zipper broke on the first pull. Other reviews said it would fit a 15.6 lap top....but is does not
4,Good Laptop Bag,This is a very good laptop bag.It is durable and there is enough room for anyone who needs to put others stuff in their laptop bag.It is a good bag for a reasonable price.
2,Disappointing,"Bought 3 of these a few months ago and 2 of them are having issues already. When I first turn my computer on, 2 of the units are ridiculous loud and emit a high pitched sound for a few minutes before returning to normal speed. They seemed to work fine for a month or so and randomly started having this issue."
2,Good idea,The concept is good but the fans are poor. I ended up taking this out and using the fans for chipset coolers... It would be nice if the fans had more CFM's.
3,This is only ok. LOUD and cheap connector.,"It has made a difference in my server by keeping it cooler, measurably.But it's loud and that's the one thing i don't like. It's too loud. The connector on it also, is super cheap. One of the leads pulled out before i even go this thing going. I managed to get it back in and make the connection but still... for the price, i expected more.THe front does slip off and you can clean the piece of cotton behind it which acts as a dust filter. Doens't really do much as dust gets in from all other openings.I probably would not buy this again. Maybe at 1/2 the price. Maybe."
1,what's the point of 96 sleeves? I CAN'T CLOSE THE CASE!!,"I got in on this deal for a great price, but when i put 90 cd's in, I couldn't even come close to closing the case, now I have to transfer them all back to the other case!!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this. I sent it back to Amazon.com for a complete refund and didn't pay a dime to return it. It is defective to the max. Read the reviews. It won't close. It strongly stinks. When I bought mine, it was on sale for 10 with a rebate of 10. I paid no shipping because I have prime. I did not appreciate being insulted with such an extremely low quality defective item, so instead of going for the rebate, which would have taken weeks to get my money back (to make it a ""free item"") I immediately sent it back to Amazon to get a refund. If only Amazon would offer a zero star option.... as many of it's customers have requested for years."
3,You can get better items than this,"When all the pockets of this case are full, you can not close the zipper. Then you have to figure out what you can remove and how you fit max. no. of cds."
2,A LOT OF BORING SCENES,"The movie centers around the Malakian crime family, an Armenian heritage family living in France. Anton is the son of the crime boss. He wants out, but doesn't want to offend his family so he stays in because he is now French and sits on a fence post. The cops are after the family, but are too ineffective to make a case against them. The movie starts out with a clever car theft, but then quickly digresses in a series of boring scenes. You don't get to feel for any of the characters, and you are confused as to which side to root for. You just wish somebody would do something. The family plans a final ultimate heist which will succeed if the French cops are too stupid to use their radio to stop their get away. The music at times was more fit for a B horror movie. Brief nudity, sex, and a little violence. Keep the fast forward on the remote handy."
3,What the He_l happened at the end?,"SPOILER ALERT!!!!! This is, overall, a pretty poorly written film, and the direction is also nothing to write home (or even to Amazon) about. But the incomprehensibility of the ending is truly confounding. Has the grandfather, Reno, killed his grandson? Does anyone other than myself note that the infant stops breathing in his mother's arms just after the Reno character has slithered out the door. If so this is a real cop out. If Reno were to stay in character he would have taken out his automatic and blown his only hope of genetic survival to smithereens, not given him an overdose of heron or whatever. I am afraid we live in an age when the life of the imagination goes unfulfilled."
4,try it twice,First time watching it I didn't really get into it. Watched it the 2nd time in the original french with english subtitles and I can say I loved it!
4,Great Photos to Captivate Busy Babies!,"This book has great photos of all sorts of ""Things That Go""; from toys, automobiles, and ocean crafts, to farm machinery, construction vehicles, and a model of the new space shuttle. The pictures are crisp and colorful, the vehicles are shown in action, and the flaps make the book fun for all kids. Busy babies will love this book!"
1,Horrible,"I give it a 4 for looking pretty, but the rest of it sucks:1) Spices are terrible quality. Basil smells (barely) like dried mint and also has other spices mixed in there, Thyme is so old and dusty it is light brown2) Tops/jars are the most stupid design I've ever seen. The spice actually gathers in between the bottle and top, so if you twist the lid off a bunch of spice falls all over your counter/shirt/whatever you are cooking.I'm actually on Amazon right now trying to find another solution because I'm just going to trash this one. If you cook a lot and use your spices often don't waste your time or money with this!"
3,Medici Effect,"I brought this book in order to assist in finding training ideas for my clients, and also to assist clients in finding thier own ideas. I was hoping that the book would be more ""easy to read"". Having said that, I havent read it all so far, but there are a lot of interesting concepts that I can utilise, but it is more time consuming then I had considered."
4,Excellent insights for entrepreneurial minded folks,"I think the basic premise is solid--your best chances of true innovation come from the ""Intersection."" It's something I had known before--I often look for lessons from other industries, to see how they apply to mine. But he expanded the concept to go beyond cross-industry pollination, to include intersections between business and biology and other less obvious combinations. The first half of the book was a real page turner. Second half slowed down--a bit of re-hashing, and overly detailed explanations for some obvious ideas. Still, overall an excellent book that I will recommend to others."
4,Good for getting in an innovative and integrative mindset,"This book was really easy to get through and I came away thinking more about how to keep my mind open to ideas from lots of different disciplines. It provides good examples of cross-discipline collaboration and why you should care. The book provides a few little tricks to get you thinking in a different way, but I found the subject matter itself to be more inspiring than directly applicable."
5,Fantastic underground-ish goodness!,"For fans of Nell's work with Theatre of Tragedy, Lacuna Coil and all kinds of great bands check The Crest out. This Norwegian band's first offering is worth buying for sure. Melodic and enchanting."
4,"A little outdated, but still very usefull","If you're planning to do your own work on your bike, this is one of the books will should have. It's not the only one, since you will need your shop manual or a Clymer manual, but it's a great start for novice mechanics. It'll help you select your tools, give you excelent tips and guide you troughout some various projects. Could be longer and with better pictures and diagrams, but it's a very usefull book nevertheless."
3,Good build but strong smell which spreads the whole room it resides.,Good build but strong smell which spreads the whole room it resides.
1,You get what you pay for,"I got this product for $6.00. I thought it's a great bargain. After using for 2 weeks, the zipper broke and I can't carry around... so frustrate. I give to my trash can for free."
1,Company Never sent the Cashback...,"Please don't expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised! To date, I've been denied twice. The second time they said the U P C number was invalid. Only, it's the original U P C barcode! I was meticulous filing the paperwork, yet they state, ""All required products were not submitted."" Meanwhile, I have phoned AMAZ0N to lodge a formal complaint.The product itself is average. I've used better and worse. That said, it's definitely not worth the full asking price."
1,waste of money,I bought this as a gift for my mom for christmas. She planted them as directed and the bulbs rotted within the week.Don't bother. the only bright spot is that she liked the vase.
5,Perfect!,They are absolutely perfect for the price. I cannot justify spending more than $20 on a pair of sunglasses and I recently broke my fake Ray Bans. I love these glasses. They are exactly what I wanted and a great great great price!
4,Monkey island,This book was a required summer school reading for my daughter but it was no longer in print. I was so happy to be able to find it for her. We both read the book and enjoyed it. Although it was a used book it was in great condition.
3,"awkward and mindless, but my son loves it so that is OK","We had problems with this game, which is annoying given that we just bought a G5. Either it didn't load properly or this game harkens back to the way computers were in the mid-80s - where you had to figure out how to do things (which key to push in an utterly counter-intuitive manner) to get it to work; for example,the only way we found to exit was to hold the tab key for a time rather than press it once (yes, some of it works by pushing some buttons longer than others, not that you would guess which button does what anyway). For whatever reason, we do not have a cursor in this. Nonethless, my son is figuring it out and enjoying it greatly, to the extent that he wants to play it first thing in the morning. It is also not too violent - baddies vanish in a puff of smoke when hit - which my wife was worried about.Recommended, but it isn't easy to use."
3,unusual,"Probably would give 3-1/2 stars but can't. This is an interesting CD, a concept piece of a sort. Musically excellent. Outstanding playing, feel, and production. Lyrically challenging since the songs are a little dark with almost all having a bleak outlook, which is in contrast to the rocking generally upbeat sound. Folk rock Americana storytelling that demands a return visit.The other review on here (if it remains) is clearly from someone with a personal ax to grind..."
3,Pick it up for artwork alone!,"This is one of my favorite trades simply because Skottie Young's artwork is so outstanding. Along with artists like Humberto Ramos (Check out Spider-Man: Return of the Goblin), his pencils are just dripping with incredible style.The story in this arc is interesting, despite the space-overlord-nano-spider-bot conspiracy and all (I guess you had to be following the series to fully understand what's happening). It's just great to see Spidey and Venom going at it, especially with another symbiote and FF thrown into the mix.My only complaint is that Young's layout could stand a few rules of cinematography to smooth out the transition from panel to panel."
4,chris byrd,"i love this game, yet at the same time i hate it. For the most part you are boxing normal boxers and its amazingly fun, but sometimes you come accross people like chris byrd who runs from you the entire time and blocks all your punches untill he runs your stamina low enough to drill you in the later rounds. IT [irritates] ME NO END. if i had more patience i would just throw jabs and straights to conserve stamina but im pretty much used to just straight up fighting to see who the better boxer is, not to see who can piss the other boxer off more. over all, however the two player is really fun and so is the create a boxer. it gets four stars because of how fun it CAN be."
1,This game is whack just like crack!!!!,First of all the analog punch control is basically the opposite of punch control. It constantly pissed me off to the point where I wanted to destroy my PS2. And the selection of the fighters for each weight class is pretty sorry. So if you read this don't waste your money and buy this just steal it. Holla.
4,Agree 99% with last rating.,"1. Great game!2. Rap music is insufferable! Get rid of it.3. Big Tigger needs a different venue -- not boxing. Get a real announcer.4. Need more big-name boxers and women boxers.5. Rewards poor. Money is amassed with nothing worth spending it on. Perhaps, like EA sports football games (where special pennants can be played), rewards could add some extra points to skills depending on trunks, gloves, etc.6. Heavy bag is nearly impossible. More skill areas needed for training.7. The next verison should allow you to carry over your current boxer.8. Get rid of the rap music. I said that twice because that alone would keep me from buying a new version of this game.Love the game."
4,Good Game,"For All You boxing Fans, this is a decent game for the Boxing standards. Forget the Soundtrack and the Hip Hop, if you do not like the Hip Hop then turn down the Music. The game has a flow unlike the others in the pass....The grapics are very realistic and draw you in.....the Different levels could improve a little but all in all it is a good Game.By the way Hip Hop is mostly Bought by Kids who do not live in the Ghetto...Don't hate the music/soundtrack hate the game."
1,Poor packaging!,Box was damaged and taped up when delivered by UPS. Package material from STAMINA is of poor quality and design. I did not open the package to check the contents. The delivery from UPS was refused and returned to sender! Amazon CS credited me for the return with no problems.
2,Not so great.,This Microfiber cleaning mitt is ok but hard to keep on your hand. I believe the cloths are easier to use. Cloths are bigger and easy to hang on to.
1,DOES NOT WORK at all for me,"I think this is the first negative review I've ever written, but this mitt does absolutely nothing--on stainless steel or any softer metal. I'm not sure what I'm doing differently than the people who wrote positive reviews--the instructions are very simple--but it just doesn't work. It looks cool--like a space-age hot pad--but I can't get it to do what I bought it to do, and I'm too busy to return it otherwise I would. Tossing it in the washing machine, as they suggest, makes me nervous too--if it did work, would I want it scrubbing my clothes/towels/rags and inside my washer? Never! (but I knew that before I bought it.)"
1,not very happy,I was very disappionted with this product....I used as directed and it did a terrible job. I would not recommend to anyone.
3,"better than other things I've tried, but....","This product works fine, but is not the miracle product I was hoping for. Maybe my expectations were too high. I had to scrub pretty hard, but eventually the smudges came off. Perhaps it would make more sense to have my children where mittens each time they enter the kitchen."
5,Entertaining Supplement for Studying Japanese,"As others have noted, this is not a stand-alone book for learning Japanese--but then, alas, this fiendishly difficult language requires a variety of books anyway. However, it does provide a thorough review of basic grammar and great colloquial phrases and structures, using panels from actual manga. It's a useful resource for someone who has a bit of Japanese and needs the reinforcement--much more fun than going through a grammar with random fabricated sentences. I look forward to going on to read more extended manga,in the Mangajin series. For a future edition, it would be helpful to have all the grammar summaries as an appendix, and a good glossary giving all the words and kanji used in the book."
5,Fun... Easy... and Awesome.,First of all I have to say this book is amazing. It's not just a book. It a book the show fun pictures and an easy way to learn Japanese.
5,The best Japanese resouce I've seen.,"I own a fair number of Japanese teaching books, but Japanese the Manga Way is easily the best of the bunch. It covers pretty much all of the grammar that you need to know in a format that doesn't get overly analytical. It does not, however, cover the kana and kanji except in passing, so you'll still need to pick up other books for that. Also, thanks to its well formatted index, I can easily use for a reference guide, unlike many books where you have to remember what chapter talked about such-and-such verb ending. And unlike the Japanese in Mangaland series (which uses its own manga), this book uses actual manga series from Japan, a nice touch. Don't expect these manga to be like the fantasy manga we get imported though; these tend to deal with normal, Japanese, daily life. Highly recommended for the beginner that's had about a month's worth of practice."
3,Good until the end,"When Jonathan Blake's hot new neighbour appears at his door claiming she just saw a ghost in her bedroom mirror and that her servants have disappeared he sees no harm in going back to her place to reassure her.Soon groups of people in Halloween costumes traverse through the locked house. At first Jonathan assumes that they are just trying to scare the girl but when he stumbles upon a corpse in a cupboard and has bullets fired at his head he realises that death may come quickly for him and the girl if they cannot overcome these Halloween intruders.This short novel starts off extremely well, you just can't put it down. The plot however jumps around so much at the end that I had to read it a few times and still don't know what happened. A clearer ending would have made this book five stars."
1,A stationary seat,"As with most of the other reviews, my daughter is also too short for this. She is ove 5 months old, but a good 3-4"" from the floor still. It's all put together and the box is gone, so I can't return it."
3,My 4 1/2month old loves it!,"The first couple of times we used it, she wanted out after 5 minutes, but my daughter is not even 5 months old. She will sit in it longer now, 15-20 minutes, just enough time to get a little house work done. I heard from many, many different people that walkers don't help a baby develope walking skills as good as the exersaucer's. So while this one will keep her entertained for now, I still plan on buying a exersaucer. Not many toys on this one, but she's figured out how to push on the blue baby dinosaur to make it light up/make music and how to spin the big ball around. Plus it does adjust to 2-3 different heights. My daughter is 24 inches long and on the lowest height she can almost reach the floor. But of course she is younger then the recommended age, so that is to be expected."
2,Too big,"After spending an hour putting all the pieces together, I put my daughter in it and she was 3 inches from the ground...and she was 5 months old! I was so bummed, because the toys are really cute and she liked to play with them. I had to return it and get a cheaper one at another retailer that she could move in."
4,very enjoyable,"i bought this for my 4 month old son a couple of weeks ago and he loves getting in the walker, even though he can't touch the ground yet and move around. he is entertained with the toys and loves bending the tree towards him. the seat is easy to take out and wash, which is really convenient. it would definitely be nice if there was an infinite height adustment so he could start learning how to walk. but, overall it's a great buy for the price."
1,Be Warned!,"These Xtreme cd cases STINKs,literally! I don't know what kind of plastic material they are using and if they are toxic, but the smell is absolutely nauseous. I kept it for two weeks hoping the smell would go away. Nope. Finally I threw it away.Other than the smell, quality-wise it is ok."
4,The rebate is fine,"The case is ok. I haven't started using it, but it looks to me. I want to say something of the rebate. I just got the confirmation email from the rebate center. It is valid. And the rebate center is the one I used a lot, which is trustable.So I wanna say don't be scared away by the comments of the rebate. It should be ok if you follow the instructions."
1,Another Rebate bites the dust.... Don't buy tech b products,I just received my card today claiming invalid UPC and invalid purchase date....RUBISH!!!I am very meticlous and I check and double check EVERYTHING before I send off the rebate...RIPOFF! Somebody needs to report these people to the BBB and the Federal Trade Commission! Any lawyers out there hungry for a Class Action???
2,"Cases good, reebayte not","Like the other revyuwer, my reb req was denyied, for the same reason, in my case for both the 224 & 264 cases, even tho both were well within the purch per. Nor did Amz post my prev rev several weeks ago. Wuts goin' on hear?Btw, the cases are fine, esp for the post-reb co$t. And my spelling is usually lots better!Updayte--funy, this revyu was posted right away, unlike the prev one. Hmm...Updayte #2--I just called the 888-295-7718 # and got them to fix the reebayte prob. Both were updated to ""valid"" on their web site within minutes. I will follow up on this and post my updayte here. There is obviously a pattern here that needs further exploration."
2,Coming Apart at the Seams,"In theory an excellent product -- room for lots of disks, relatively compact and attractive HOWEVER I purchased three of these (2 for me 1 for a friend) I can't say how his is doing but both of mine have faulty zippers, making it impossible to close the binders and therefore losing much of their attractiveness and compactness. (...). All in all, a disappointment."
3,A Perfect Laugh!,This was a great light read that was not only humorous but romantic at the same time. Brooke and Alex get off to a great start (mistaken identity) and the two of them will never be the same again. Imagine being attracted to the man you think has gotten your kid sister pregnant but in reality is your boss. Oh yeah you don't know that he is your boss!This was a well plotted story with great characters that you want to read about. Brooke and Alex have great chemistry and the secondary characters are also great additions to the cast. Not a 4* story but still worth putting forth an effort to get a hold of a copy.
4,He was sick of what was wrong AND what was right,"Not a quick read, but one that you continuously think about and want to get back into anytime you can. I started this book two weeks before attending my son's graduation from the University of Virginia's School of Law. Turns out, that commencement marked the 60th anniversary of Bobby Kennedy's graduation from the school. The commencement speaker, US Attorney General Eric Holder, spoke eloquently and at length about the graduates' fellow alum, RFK, and it appeared to me he had read this very book. In any case, I highly recommend it as a biography of an American hero, and, as a history of mid 20th century America."
1,label?,the package says hook closure right on it - why does the description say velcro? i am looking for velcro so...
3,Older was better,"We have and older version of this book at our nursery school. While the content is still the same, and it cleverly emphasizes the true meaning of Christmas, I prefer the older edition. A book this well written deserves to be published in hard cover and I also found the original illustrations more charming. It is type the of book you want to read year after year. Hard cover would better serve this purpose. Also, it is preferable in giving it as a gift. I give it an ""A"" for content but a ""C"" for presentation."
2,Disappointed.,"Loved the story, disliked the film. With bad dialogue and over the top holllywood fx, a great franchise has been taken down a notch. Great concept, poorly written."
2,Underworld Awakinging.,"A bit disappointing compared to the original movie. It was very fragmented, and at times almost incoherent. There's too much reliance on computer generated special affects rather than plot and characters. Wished they focused more on the central characters, and less on the ""wow"" factor."
4,Good movie to the set,"Underworld awakening is a good movie in the Underworld set. I only gave it four stars because of the fact it's only about hour and twenty minutes long before the end credits. It does set up a 5th movie in the set and movie rumors say that scott speedman is coming back as Micheal for the 5th movie in the set but guess we will just have to wait and see if it's true. As for the movie itself I personally enjoy it, good story line and lots of action scenes. I did agree with a few reviews that said they wish the super wearwolf had more air time on sceen. But it was still a great movie and well worth waiting for it to be on DVD. So if you love to watch vampire or wearwolf movies then pick this up and enjoy some good horror on a free evening with your buddies or just by yourself while relaxing from life or work. Plus forget the bad reviews just make up your own mind after watching it."
4,Series sticking to its strengths,"The ""Underworld' series returns to form, in this the 4th installment. Getting the star Kate Beckinsale back adds the needed spark.Borrowing a plot device from older horror movies, the star returns after being on ice for a number of years. The world may have changed during Selene's slumber but she has not. The movie has a decent plot that doesn't get in the way of the frequent battles, fights, shootings, car chases and other action. Staying with its strengths, they deliver a very entertaining flick that fans of the previous 3 movies in the series will certainly enjoy. Most of all, they seem to realize that Selene IS the series and they keep her front and center where fans want her."
2,Good movie but not worth buying,This movie was very disappointing. I am a huge Underworld fan and thankfully I did not go see this movie at the theater or I would have been really upset. Its only an hour and fifteen minutes long and they could have cut out half of it. Wait until it goes on sale and then buy it. I hope the next movie is a lot better.
2,Underworld Awakening..,"Kinda of disappointing ....seem to be lacking a carry-over story from the previous movie....3D was not so great either....Overall the movie was disappointing , and not as good as I thought it should be....Everyone is different , so where we didn't care for it, .I'm sure other people loved it...."
2,"Stop while you're ahead, please","Of course i believe directers and film producers just make movies for the hell of it just to make money, however i wish they'd stopped milking some of my favourite movies in order to do so, i mean the first two underworlds brilliant the third one: although not necessary still good and i enjoyed it however this one is just lacking the excitement and joy of making the first two, they had no way of really making a fourth one without coming up with some pointless story which made it even more ludacris: well they succeed at that and by the looks of it we could have a 5th one on its way! Kate Beckinsale is on top form and im sure i speak for everyone when i say we enjoy watching her on screen however this movie shouldnt have been made they should have quit whilst they were ahead!"
5,sam's opinion,"The only real disappointment for me in the saga was #2. However, the rest have been unique with excellent supporting actors and Ms. Beckingsale is superb! The ""Awakening"" delivers and it thrills me that there are rumors of a 5th movie.""Awakening"" was intense from the opening moment and never slowed down. The daughter was amazing and brought the maternal side of Selene out and the introduction of the new coven, the son especially, added so much. The police officer was also a good supporting actor. Bad guy was also awesome. Out there, but awesome.Althouth, there was the typical good vs. bad, but they did it with finesse.I would give it a 5. Keep in mind, I am an avid follower of these movies. Best vampire and werewolf movies of the day!"
1,Underworld Awakening,"I normally dont write reviews but for this movie i thought i would make the exception. I was sorely disappointed very weak story compared to the rest of the series. felt like the movie was only half way done when it ended. i can understand if this was a bridge for the next one, but renting it would be the way to go. it felt like it could have been an extended trailer. bummer."
3,Better than Underworld 3,"Another blast into the blue tinged Underworld that we've come to know as this franchise is slowly milked to death. Shot for 3D using Red Epic cameras, this is the best looking of the four movies, and script/action wise better than 2 or 3. Kate still looks great in full leather, but don't expect any surprises outside the genre."
3,Underworld: Awakening (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy) [Blu-ray 3D],"Good price for a single disc 3D movie, when you hit ""play movie"" in your menu you will get the choice to watch it in either 3D or normal mode. My opinion - even if you don't have 3D capabilities, you should ALWAYS buy the 3D version. Who knows? One day you might and then you won't have to buy all new discs. The 3D is decent, nothing amazing and there are good special features. The movie itself is better than Underworld 2, but not as good as 1 or 3."
3,Average Movie,"I finished watching Underworld Awakening and found myself unimpressed.The story for this movie just wasn't that good, and I would consider it the worst of the series so far. Kate Beckinsale carries the movie, but only because she is very beautiful. That by itself helps to improve or cover up the other areas of the movie that are lacking. Some reviews say they finished this movie wanting more. I finished this movie saying is this it?Kate has done a good job playing her part in all the movies, and they are lucky they have someone like her to make up for the poor story that she was given. I wish she would come to my house and bite me, but the movie itself was just mediocre. Good enough to rent one and never look at it again."
1,not worth the cash,"I was really wanting to watch this and within the first 5 min i could see that it was on a downward spiral, the effects are subpar and the story is loose at best. I'm guessing they plan on another show by the way this ended but I couldn't say i would go watch it, or even rent it due to how bad this one was. Not giving details just in case you do rent it, but i will say this it is very disapointing."
1,wait for 3D,"Agin will have to wait months for the 3D, They want you to buy the Blu-ray now then around Nov/Dec the 3D will come out and you pay another $30+ for it."
2,Not worth it.,"Short, boring movie with little plot - like a really long trailer for a better movie. If you are looking for some Underworld action, I suggest you just watch one of the earlier versions."
3,Prepping for another one....,I enjoy this series....this was a little far-fetched. I think this was prep for another one; finding Michael and so on.
5,I'm addicted!,"Kate Beckinsale returns as the death dealer with a human side to her vampirism. This may be her greatest work in the Underwold series. As long as Ms. Beckinsale cranks these out, I'll be buying them."
3,A lot of action,"Non stop, action with sexy girls who are able to take on anyone in a fight. After a while to me, it got a bit too much. Boring actually as the story was not very interesting, and I do want to see more than just action.The acting was good. They all acted well.The camera work and special effects were good.I would not recommend it unless you are hooked on the series."
5,Kate Beckinsale!,Kate Beckinsale is in this movie and is in a full body skin tight vampire killing suit. That is really all that you need to know. What is going on in the movie is irrelevant.
1,?,I did not get a chance to watch this movie because it was not in my library when I went back to watch it later that day. I lost money on this one.
2,Disappointed,"I loved the first movie, great stuff. The second movie not quite as much, though they did a good job with the brothers' scariness. This third movie felt like they needed some quick money, so they punched out a quick movie. There being a child thrown in really made it seem like they were leaving the door open for more Underworld movies. When in the mood I'll have a little Underworld retrospective and watch the first 2 Underworld movies back to back. I am not even going to bother buying Awakening unless it gets to a price low enough that I can rationalize it as completing a series. Sorry Kate."
3,For diehard Underworld fams,I watched the 3D version and the effects of explosions and the like were good. Storyline was interesting but not mindboggling. Acting was to be expected of an action movie. A good yarn for a slow night but nothing to rave too much about. But it was enjoyable for what the Underworld franchise could offer and certainly better than number 3.
2,Very disapointing!,I would have to say this was the worst Underworld out of the series. The story line was terrible. To me is seemed more of a Resident Evil movie than Underworld. The flickering lights that are in most of the movie are annoying. The film and graphics also seemed to be low budget compared to the other three movies.
1,underworld awakening horrible,"This movie was so bad I will not add it to my collection. The first three were awsome and some of my all time favorites but this one was junk. plot was horrid, action was null, no scott. the whole set up was bad bad bad. not sure how anyone gave it 4 and 5."
1,Very bad picture quality,"Watching these DVDs is like watching a tiny mpeg blown up to fill the screen. The compression artifacts are annoyingly apparent and it's like watching the video through a curtain of debris.""The Kid"" isn't as bad in quality as the other three shorts are, but the picture is still a bit blurred nonetheless.I'm going to take pjmccart's advice and get the Warner/MK2 copy of ""The Kid"" ... or maybe even the 2-disc Special Edition version."
1,Ecology of Fear misnamed.,"The ""Ecology of Fear"" should really be called ""The Rhetoric of Fear"" by Mike ""Chicken Little"" Davis.A book whose facts seem dubious, at best. Where's the journalistic integrity in footnoting and quoting oneself? There are dozens of pithy quotes in this book attributed to no one. He even goes so far as to present the ever popular squelcher of opposition, the race card.Where are the hordes of lion attacked, coyote bitten, tornado victims exiting L.A?I think he's been stuck in Hollywood too long watching (or writing) all those ""B"" horror movies."
1,The literary equivalent of Jerry Springer.,"If you enjoy talk TV, manufactured ""facts,"" and hysterical arm-waving, then this book is for you. That Davis is a good writer, with a fine sense of style, doesn't make up for the book's short-comings (after all, Springer is an accomplished provocateur). Davis distorts or stretches facts, abuses statistics, and then warns of the dire consequences to us all. Unfortunately, this book cannot be trusted, and is about as useful to on-going discussions of public policy in Los Angeles as a supermarket tabloid. This is junk, masquerading as information. Other than that, a wonderful contribution to the literature of the ""Big Orange."""
3,Wasn't as new as I thought it would be,It wasn't as new as I thought it would be because I can see markings on the edges of the book.

4,Not for sissies...,"Which I am. This will kick your fanny cause it's all you-- not a motor. Cheap, easy to set up and folds up for storage. Not too heavy and moves around on wheels. I recommend it."
4,Exactly what the picture shows.,"Good buy overall. The actual ring is pretty exact to what the picture shows. The finish is a little more flat, but not much. Comfortable and affordable - no complaints here!"
5,Beautiful Ring,"Beautiful ring! AWESOME customer service!! Seller shipped EXTREMELY FAST!! The first ring I ordered was a bit too small so I had to exchange it for a size larger. Seller shipped replacement ring immediately. The rings run a little small, so you might want to order one size larger than you normally would. I normally wear a size 4, but I needed a 5. EXCELLENT! 5 stars!"
4,Purchased two silver bands,"I was very happy with the two rings and the speed at which they arrived. I bought a size 6 and a size 13. Unfortunantly, I cannot use the 13 because it was sized to the wrong finger.:( My husband needed a different size."
2,Not that useful. No insight.,"I did not find the book very useful. The explanation are not insightful. If you are a management consultant already, then the content would be too light for you. The only thing i like is that they have collected a nice list of 2x2 matrix, some of which is a relaxing and fun matrix to know."
2,"They are cute, but cheap!","They are cute, but cheap! They were bent when I received them. I would never order these again. Not at all what I expected."
1,A piece of Junk,This worked intermittently since I bought it. Now it won't even recognize media (even Sony Media). I waited too long so now I can't return it (my bad).This is the worst computer purchase I have ever made.Forget the sleek looks of Sony and buy something that actually works.
2,Best of a bad lot,"Not happy with this book. The man knows his physics, but his use of the English language needs a good make-over. Sentences too long, very few commas, and muddled grammar. Many proof-reading errors. Problems are too hard for beginners, being excerpts from Honours exams - which students are tested on at the END of the course, not while they are still learning. No examples, no solutions and no colour. Other books are worse, though. The definitive Nuclear Physics textbook is yet to be written. Surely there must be a professor somewhere who knows his stuff, is a half-decent writer and has some idea of style and composition."
3,Decent text on nuclear and particle physics,"As a physics graduate student, I used this text in a refresher course at the upper undergrad/grad level. The text contains quite a few typos, but there is a errata available. I have not seen many text that deal with both nuclear and particle physics, so that is a plus. However, I must say the text is not easy to read, and can be confusing at times. However, I do think it will be a useful reference, and is a good place to start for beginners in this field."
3,"Works OK in XP, no linux support that I can find.","This product seems to work well enough. I got it to transfer some home movies to my computer so that I can burn them to DVD. The quality seems to be as good as the low-resolution analog source, and it runs well on my 3-year-old 2-GHz Athlon 64 running XP (32-bit version).The main problem with this unit is that it does not have any sort of Linux driver that I could find. Ubuntu 7.10 does not recognize it, and I could not find anything on the internet that had any suggestions.Also, DO NOT loose the driver disk. Adaptec does not provide any downloadable drivers. Shame on you, Adaptec, for this oversight."
1,Not Usable,I have not been able to install the software from the disk on either XP or Vista. It says that it can not find the drivers even when I direct it to the Drivers folder on the disk that came with the device. For me it is a total loss.
4,"Very good tea, but....","Very good tea, yet for some reason when I purchase these in Israel, they have much more flavor and smell fantastic and strong. Still very good, but would be better if the tea was the same all over the world, not just country by country."
1,Played it once it sucks,The worst racing game I have ever played. They could have spent some time and money on this one. Dont buy
2,Not a good game,"This game is pretty bad in my view. The only saving grace to this game is probably the nitrous oxide feature used to boost. The graphics are pretty poor, especially considering it is a new generation game, but they are not terrible I guess. What annoys me mostly is the very flat appearance of the cars when in third person mode. I only noticed a couple of cars that don't look two-dimensional from the back, and that was primarily due to the fact that they had spoilers on the back. Not to mention that the intro. video to the game has really good graphics and then you end up disappointed when you see the actual game as it does not even measure up to the preview. If you're thinking of buying it, I would buy it really cheap used, and even then don't expect much out of it. Hope this helps..."
1,I wish 0 stars was an options,"Schoen claiming to be ""America's #1 expert on circumcision"" is quite laughable. I find the man to be very ignorant, arrogant, and incredibly creepy. I don't trust a man who writes poetry comparing a circumcised male appendage to the statue of Venus. If you want a REAL expert on circumcision, go with Dr Paul Fleiss."
1,A disservice to boys.,Dr.Schoen needs to admit that circumcision is now known to be unnecessary and even harmful to boys. What ever happened to the Do No Harm oath?
5,"GREAT, GREAT READ...5+ Stars",Great historical book on Florida. The characters are all very likeable. I highly recommend it. GREAT WORK! I am anticipating the next novel by this talented author.
4,"It's good, naturally good","This book, although small in size, is packed full of stunning beauties. It is fairly dated but the girls are all stunning and all but a few are natural redheads. An up to date version of this book would really put the icing on the cake, but whilst we wait for that, this book will certainly fuel a passion.The dvd to go with this series is an absolute must for any 'redophiles'. Both are recommended highly."
3,Caesar's Gallic Wars,"This is not a book for the light hearted. You will need to know your history. The difficulty in reading this book was not having a map of the cities with todays locations in them. If you love history, you may enjoy this book."
3,"Definitely the early years before the best years, however.......","......there are about six or seven tracks that will capture your attention. In my opinion, the compilations' best tracks are ""Your'e the Only Bargain I've Got"", ""Your Love Controls Me"", ""Will You Be There?"", ""Taster of the Honey (Not the Keeper of the Bee)"", ""I Need You"", ""I Turn To You"", ""The Proof is in the Pudding"" and ""Man on the Take"".Mostly, the album is comprised of songs that sound like ""session"" and studio tracks not intended for official release on an LP, but the ones I named could've easily fit any early (or later) works by the ladies.What this peak into the early years does do, however, is offer devoted fans a taste of what preceded the more polished tracks in later years. In my opinion, it's a ""must-have"" for any long-time fan of the Jones Girls."
3,''roman'',"yes this was an interesting film , but lacked at being a good film. it was'nt the acting or the plot ,there just was not enough. it was definetly a strange film and roman him self is a weirdo"
3,"Watch ""May"" then watch ""Roman"" and then don't try to act like either one of them!","This is a pretty good predictable horror movie that has a slow build. Before you see ""Roman"" watch ""May"". The two movies have nothing to do with each other in storyline (they are related in production life) but May will put you in the mood to watch a loner attempt to deal with everyday life.The character Roman, and the darkened room with the shades pulled setting he lives in, makes it so believable he's a loser that leads a boring life it makes the first part of the movie overwhelmingly dark and depressing. The poor guy doesn't even own a TV so he draws a TV on the wall!If you loved May, you will like Roman."
2,"Oh so dull, so so dull...","What's there to say about this..well quickly it's about a shy guy (Roman) who's only enjoyment in the world is the 30 seconds each day that a pretty neighbour (Kristen Bell) passes his window. He does something stupid and try's to cover his tracks.The only redeeming feature I can give about this film, is if you're a film student or are trying to make your own movie then this is something that may interest you.It's one of those movies where everyone in it was paid in beer money and did it for ""the joy of acting"", which on the plus side is very good, if only the story was a bit more entertaining.It's grey, dull and boring please don't buy this film."
1,NEVER CAME ?,"I cant review this product as its never arrived at my door, despite ordering over 5 weeks ago and I have no refund, shocking"
2,"great show, bad dvd","This show is awesome, but be warned everyone, if you are buying this because you would love to see the show to the fullest (meaning uncensored) dont buy it. its all censored. which is dumb. so dumb. im so mad. funny show, but terrible dvd. the only reason i bought it was for the uncensored episodes and deleted scenes."
2,"Show is great, DVD is not","This is an awesome show. I have so much fun watching this. The show alone is five stars, hands down. The season 2 dvd's are nothing like the first season. Menu screens are minimal, no commentary for episodes, cannot choose which deleted scene you want to watch, etc. These are on DVD-R dvd's. I am not sure about other owners of this product, but the quality of viewing is lower on this than season 1. If I didn't absolutely love this show, I would have tried to return these dvd's."
5,About time we had something fun to listen to!,Where has she been all this time! I like country again
1,Great expectation unfulfilled,"I tend to agree with a reviewer from Texas that the book provide one-sided information. Scholars, involved in the study of ethnic conflicts, should be always aware of the complexity of the issues, contradicting narratives and, therefore, try to present a balanced story. Croissant failed to do so. It should be acknowledges also that the book was written in mid-1990s when not much resources were available. However, that does not justifies the poor performance of the authors. For unbiased view of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan number one book is Tom de Waal's ""Black Garden""."
2,I wouldn't recommend purchasing this product,"Disappointed when the spice rack arrived. It looked great when pulling it out of the box, however it leans to the side and doesn't stand up straight. I tried to tighten the screw in the bottom, but it was already tight. If you prop it against the wall it will stand up straight. The lazy susan doesn't turn very easy either. I wish it looked as nice as it looks in the picture."
4,Pretty adequate,"I bought this rack because I had moved across the country and the moving company didn't allow any food products. I was going to just grab a few jars from the store, but wow! Price shock!So, I looked this up on Amazon and decided against the reviews. People who say bad about this product must have gotten a bad batch or the one out of a hundred dud carousel.I have no particular complaints, nor praise, toward this product. The herbs are standard, maybe even a little stale (then again, they're dried herbs, so who ever knows?). The carousel works great (maybe even a little fast! ha!) and the jars are all labelled nicely.The best way to describe it is adequate, but that's not necessarily a bad thing."
1,don't buy this,we purchased this mower and took it back after the battery kept dying. we couldn't even mow a fourth of the yard before we had to stop and recharge. then it died completely after about 2 months.
4,BD cordless mower cmm1200,"It's so easy a caveman can do it. LOL. Seriously, my wife and i took it out of the box, attached the handle, plugged it up to charge....and voila, it MOWs.My yard is less than 1800 SF so i can mow it twice (North/South then East/West) to make sure everything is trimmed. The one drawback is that it doesnt have the suction power of a gas mower so you have to make an extra run to cut some of the longer blades.Even though it weights over 60lbs and is not self propelled, you wouldn't even notice the weight....since it is on 4 wheels the weight is distributed evenly.1. quite2. liteweight3. clean, no gas, oil, mess...."
1,Overpriced,"The mower does not cut very well. The wheels push grass down and there is not enough vacuum to pull the grass back up. An hour or so after cutting the grass, I find lines of uncut grass that raised back up."
4,"Works so far, terrible operating manual","Juat purchased mower. I used it to cut my overgrown lawn and it worked great. I thought the tall grass would bog out the motor, but that was not the case. I noticed other reviews about reliability, so I will have to wait and see. One thing is for sure, the owners manual is poorly put together, with the pictures to the rear of the instructions. Black & Decker should at least upgrade the online manual."
4,24 volt mower,Fast exelent service; mower has more than adequet power; long charge cycle; is a little heavier than expected but still a very good choice
4,Can't wait to mow again,I just bought this mower after our gas powered one died. It was actually a pleasure to mow. It's much lighter than expected after reading other reviews. It's easier to maneuver and lighter than my old mower. I'm an average size female and pushing this around was easy for me.I love that I can tip it over to clean and not have to worry about gas & oil spills. I also love the easy starting mechanism.So far the only complaint I can think of is that the battery can't be removed so I could get a spare and keep one charged all the time.
3,Good little machine,I got this good little machine and could put it together very very easily. Very simple instructions. Really like it. Only problem is that I can't do my whole yard with a charge yet. Partly because I like the yard short. If I could learn to enjoy the longer look it would manage the whole yard. I really enjoy the easy adjustment for length of grass. I especially appreciate the easy start and stop and no gas fumes. I general I am very happy with the purchase. Everything the description said was true. I had no surprises. I would definitely purchase this good little machine again.
4,Excellent battery life/ cut good,"Came out of the box ready to go. Battery life is long enough to cut my suburban lawn at least 2 times. In mulching mode it does not seem to always cut all grass blades I go over. Overall, I am happy with the purchase and is an excellent mower to start the my older boys out with."
2,Cheap Starter Assembly and Far Distant Repair Shop,"The starter handle and its assembly snapped off after about 20 uses. I should have looked before I purchased, but was surprised to find that the nearest Black and Decker repair facility (according to their web site) was 2 round-trips of 60 miles each. (total of 60 miles to take it, and 60 miles to retrieve it after repairs.)Fortunately, I was able to find an authorized repair shop just 5 miles away, but they were not listed on the B&D; website."
2,"good performance, POOR DESIGN","Although this mower works well at cutting grass and bagging leaves, the switch is very poorly designed and has broken on both (I purchased two mowers since I have a larger yard) mowers within one year. A flimsy plastic handle pivots on a thin plastic post, held by a light-weight spring. The plastic post degrades and fatigues quickly, and eventually breaks off at both ends, resulting in a mower that will not operate. I have not subjected the mower to unusually severe treatment, and cannot fathom why an otherwise well-designed appliance should have such a poorly designed switch."
1,Dangerous Dead Man Switch Failure,"First some history - I used the older CMM1000 mower for almost 10 years and I was very happy with it. I am a strong proponent of electric cordless mowers as they have a small environmental impact compared with gas mowers, so when I read that the CMM1200 had a longer battery life I decided to replace the old mower.Initially I was satisfied with the mower - it allowed me to mow more lawn on one charge than the older model and it cut as well as the older model. However, I was concerned about the dead man switch, which seemed flimsy.Well, after using the mower for five months, the plastic pin on which the dead man switch handle pivots broke - luckily, when it broke the mower shut off. Had the switch jammed open it could have been very dangerous.This failure is a significant safety hazard and I am surprised that the design of the switch was approved by Black and Decker quality control, and that this weakness was not detected and corrected during QC testing."
2,Don't Waste Your Money!,"Okay, WHEN it works, it cuts nicely and will actually do about half the lawn. Then you need to plug it in and wait another day to do the other half. But it has been a lemon from the get go! The starter broke two days after the first month (and you get a 30 day guarantee) then the charger deteriorated at the base of the charge box within the next 4 months. No charging now!!! It would have been cheaper to purchase gas for the gas mower!!! It's WORTHLESS!!!!!!!!! We now have a lovely dead lawn ornament awaiting pickup from recycle! Not to mention is cost us $400!"
2,Mower Stopped Re-charging after Seven Uses,"This mower was great until it stopped working! It was quiet, mulched well, and the charge lasted long enough to cut our front & back yards (approx. 1/4 acre), BUT... After seven uses, it stopped recharging. I visited Amazon and noticed that others are experiencing similar problems, so Black & Decker is aware of the defect, but failed to be proactive in notifying customers who had purchased and registered their mowers. For this reason, rather than work with Black & Decker, I returned the mower to Lowes (thankfully they issued a full refund) and purchased a gas-powered mower. Wish the Black & Decker had been more reliable!"
4,"Great product, Very Happy With, Except...","The battery charger... I have had this mower for four years and it has run very well. However, I am in need of a third battery charger. I had to replace the battery charger after the second year. Now, I have to replace it again. Don't know why, but that is the ONLY problem I have had with this mower. Again, I am very satisfied with its performance, not a problem at all. The chargers seem to run a little over $50. My next mower, though, is going to be the 12amp MM875. It is 20+ pounds lighter, no batteries, have to use a cord (that's ok with me), and it is cheaper. But a great mower nonetheless. (Wish I could sell mine locally for $100 without the charger, and purchase the MM875)."
4,Nice Mower,"My only big gripe is that I wish the battery would last longer.Otherwise, this mower is easy to handle and IMHO well worth the buy."
1,Sucks,I can't get it to work cuz my computer does not recognize the drivers. I wish I hadn't bought it.
4,Sebago mens classic,I am new to buying online from Amazon I live in New ZealandI took what I thought was a risk buying shoes sight unseenI have been amazed at the speedy service from Amazon - only daysfor the shoes to arrive from the USThe shoes were a steal compared with prices here in New ZealandQuality is good ( not superb - but still good)the shoes fit well despite US sizing being different to ourswell done - a very happy shopper
5,great fit,"Good price, and the shoes fit perfectly. I have a tough size (14B), so I was really happy that I could find shoes that fit."
1,A dull book with poor focus,"I agree with Dr. Matthew Rivas-- this book is a disappointment. I bought it after reading a review in WIRED magazine, and found it to be a rambling biography that offers little real insight into its subject."
1,Disappointing and Annoying,"What with all the competently made multi-player trivia games on the market, it was inevitible that Star Trek would eventually check in with one. Unfortunately, the questions aren't all that challenging, the hosts (Q and a female counterpart) and the general game mechanics leave much to be desired. The Q's dialogue is almost instantly annoying and it takes up more time than the actual game.Once in the game, even though a Trek fan will know most of the answers, it's not that easy to give them. It's multiple choice, but you have two second after you ring in to hit the right key. The problem is, the keys aren't the numbers, as in You Don't Know Jack"", but letters, so you not only have to know the answer, you also have to hunt down the right letter before your time is up.Even if you're a fan of Trek and trivia, you might want to pass on this one."
1,"Poor game, buggy, poor execution.","The game is hard to get to run on a PC. I once had it running on my Win 3.1 system and maybe my Win98 system although I can't get it running on either 98 or ME now. When I did have it running a major problem with the game was the inclusiveness of it. I am a hard core Star Trek fan but since I never got into Voyager I get killed playing the game. There's no way to restrict the subjects to just TOS, Next Gen, DS9, and Movies. Often questions require you to SPELL the answers even though they were never spelled out when broadcast. Often you know the answer but how to respond is ambiguous."
3,Star Trek: The Game Show CD-ROM,"This game has a variety of trivia that spans all of the series and the movies. Q's comments tend to get a little old as he says the same things over and over again. Also it doesn't take long before the questions start to be repeated. Over all it is a fun game for the first little while, but you need to be a hard core Star Trek fan to put up with the repeation."
3,Misery Lives!,"This was a short thriller but it constantly kept reminding me of the book and successful movie, MISERY. The kidnap, the re-living of the story, the search---everything that MISERY had in its novel/movie. There is no originality. But I can say one thing about the author . . . she's a true Stephen King fan!"
3,Helpful,I thought this book was very helpful because it is a lot of other women sharing their feelings after their own miscarriages. It made me feel like I wasn't alone in my feelings of grief. That helps a lot.
1,dont buy !!,this game is the worst fight game ever the controls for punching sux !! a toddler could box better in real life than those guyz on the game! not a good game at all dont waste your money spend it on a slipknot or metallica cd
4,Young Cam Jansen and the Double Beach Mystery,Purchased for a six year old girl. She loves these books. They are well written and interesting for a child this age.
1,Bad Support,This company is notorious for it tech support or lack thereof. You have to submit on their site and keep checking back until they answer. Don't hold you breath as it can take weeks if ever.
3,Realistic,"I found this to be a good book, but at the same time, I found it to have weak points. It really is a miracle that these pants fit four girls of different sizes. It's also incredible how a pair of pants can travel to Greece in a matter of days from half way around the world. Ever tried it? It does take some time. I did find that it seemed like one of the girls seemed a less mature then the others. But at the same time, I found that there was something that kept me reading...something that's hard to describe. I tried to put it down for somethign else, but I kept wondering about the book, so I had to finish. Read it if you have time on your hands."
4,Great Book!,"First, I have to admit, I am not a teenager. I am 34 years old, but had to buy it!This is a great book. I couldnt put it down, and now I cant wait to read the Second Summer!This book is about 4 very best friends, and a special pair of pants that seems to help strengthen their friendship, and help them through some tough times, while being apart for the summer.The book is written well, and keeps you turning the pages to see what happens next!AFter reading this book, it just makes me treasure my friendships I still carry from school even more!My daughter is 10, and I cant wait for her to read it too. Maybe in a year or two."
3,Not what you'd expect...EVEN BETTER!!!,"I was really prepared not to like this book. I'd read some of the reviews, and although they were good, I just couldn't bring myself to read a book about travelling pants. It just sounded so out there and stupid and from what I thought so very unentertaining. Boy was I wrong. It was so good. The heroines were diverse and each had amazingly interesting plots. Its a really good read. I definitely recommend it."
3,"Cute Idea, Didn't Entierly Cut It","A cute plot, interesting charecters... but it just didn't quite add up.My favorite little subplot was Tibby and Bailey's, and Bridget's. Lena's was pretty dull, as was Carmen's.I think the book dealt with death very well. It was a little predictable, but I was still surprised.In Bridget's scenario, I think they should have gone on into more detail. We never find out exactly what happens between her and Eric.Overall, this was a cute story, though mostly fluff. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone under the age of 10 or 11, if even them."
4,True Friendship,"The name is a little goofy, and I will admit that I was a little hesitant to read it after receiving it for Christmas. But reading it definatly wasn't a let down! In fact, after finishing it I opened it up to the first page and read again, and again, and again.This story is the perfect addition to any teenager's collection. It shows that no matter how different your lives are, how dramastically different your experiences are, your friends are your friends no matter what. I can't wait for the sequel!"
4,"totally touching,totally living, totally real","I've never, ever, ever read a book so full with life. It was truly like I was really there, watching lena, tib, carma, and bee go through their life's ups and downs, feeling their anger when they were mad, crying for them in the tough times, being happy when they were. this book is written so personally, so REAL, so uniquely that it's really hard to believe these characters aren't real. Most third-person narratives I've read seem pretty dry and unreal (no offense to the authors of them), but the whole Sisterhood series has been more heartfelt then many first-person narratives I've read. THe girls lives are expressed by their real thoughts and feelings, not just thir actions.They experience their lives just like you and I experience ours."
2,Not appropriate for young girls- or older ones,"I bought this book for my 12 year old niece after reading several reviews, and decided I'd read it for myself first after reading one of the rules- never let a boy take off the pants, although you may take them off in his presence. I found this book to have too many sexual references for a girl any younger than 14, and even then I don't think I would want my daughter reading it. One of the girls decided to persue her much older soccer coach, for example. The lessons of friendship and self-esteem are great, but there were too many inappropriate references for a young girl, and by the time they were old enough, say 14 or 15, the book would no longer be interesting to them."
4,Second best book of the year.,"I enjoyed this book, even though it was a very simple minded idea. It was still interesting, and involved us in the the lives of four very different girls. My only problem with it is I'd just finished reading a sleeper, SIGHTS by Susanna Vance, that is the best thing Random House ever published for teens. That book was so honestly written and so SMART, TRAVELING PANTS didn't have a chance. I can recommend both, but TP is a lighter read."
4,A great book to read,I really like this book at first i was like okay this is really corny but as i started to read more and more i fell in love with it . It shows how strong friendship is sometimes and how a summer apart cant change anything i suggest this book to everyone .
4,"Edifying, yet not the best","I enjoyed this book. While a few scenes are not appropriate, it had good messages overall. The descriptions of the way the girls feel are right on--you can tell that Brashares has been a teenage girl! She tells it like it is."
5,awsome!!,i didnt read the book (well the whole thing) but i plan too. i just saw the movie it was soo good! it was sad it really made you think. so read it and see the movie!
3,NOT Greek to me- but cute nonetheless,"Good novel and though I'm way past the demographic age, read it in a few hours. However, was there no editor involved? Greeks refer to their grandmothers as Yia Yia and their grandfathers as Papou. Kostos should have been Kostas and Lena should have been Eleni. I'm married to a Greek-trust me, I know these things..."
1,The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"This book is not worth your time. It took me months to read the book! That may sound ridiculus, but this book was such a drag that I just carried it around to my classes, and read it when I simply had too. The author had no real plot, or expectations for her novel to begin with. Than you add in a bunch of stupid, ditzy teenagers with no lifes and you have utter crap. The problems the children, yes children in this book have are not even problems. The dialouge in this book is plain, elementary and leads to nowhere. It was confusing to read, and had terrible organazation. Please don't waste your time. The author seemed like she had to have exactly X number of pages and just rambled so she could get to that number. I hated it, it was one of the worst books i've ever read!"
4,Great book on disk for travel,My 10 yr old daughter & I had a 10 hour drive & I bought this bos enteok on disk to keep us entertained. It was a great way to pass the time! We enjoyed the voice of the reader and it was a very cute story.
5,Excelent,"Liked the price and the book. It has a soft cover, and though it's a little weak it is colorfull and shiny... I loved it. It also includes a reading book's section that is helpfull even if you are reading alone. I liked it."
4,Pretty good book!,"I really liked this book but the only thing is, the text to speech is not enabled so the kindle can not read to you."
4,Kara-- The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"This book was about four best friends who found a pair of jeans, they were amazing. The jeans fit all of the girls even though they were different sizes. The four girls had to be seperated for the summer for the first time in their lives. One of them was going to soccer camp; one was going to her grandparents; one was staying home; and one was going to her dad's housse. They decided that throughout the summer they would pass on the pants to each girl, and each of them would do something exciting in them. It would keep them together in a special way.I liked this book because it was exciting, but still realalistic. I think everyone could read it, or listen to it because the audio readers voice wasn't bad for once!!!!!"
4,The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"The Sisterhood of the Traveling PantsRanie and I really enjoyed this book because it discussed issues of young women growing up that we could relate to. It was filled with many emotions that had you laughing at one point and crying at another point. The characters are all different and that was a good aspect of the story because any girl could relate to at least one character. Bridget, Lena, Carmen and Tibby were friends from birth because their moms were in the same Lamaze class, so their adventures started from there. They discover a magical pair of pants that fits each of them perfectly, and the pants travel with each girl as they spend the summer apart. The pants help the girls stay close to eachother while they are so far apart. We highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys being a girl!!"
4,The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"I thought that The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants was interesting enough. Some parts it was slow, but I still enjoyed it. I liked how the girls had real teenage problems. There is romance, but it's definately NOT typical. I really liked this book. But, have your parents read it before. They might not want you to read it. There is some mature content in there."
