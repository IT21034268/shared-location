5,What a SURPRISE,I have a 60 GB Ipod and I have tried 4 other products in my car but this one is by far my favorite. None of the accessories that are offered for the Ipod sound 100% and never have static or interference but this one gives you the most options for changing radio stations. Increasing the volume is somewhat confusing but not impossible. Overall this product is the best on the market for those with cigarette lighter adapters in awkward places. You must be careful with adjusting the neck.I recommend handling this product with care because it is delicate. Recently my TuneBase stopped working because one of the parts broke. I called Belkin and they replaced it with a new one no questions asked. Not many companies stand behind their products like that. I am pleased with the no hassle return because I LOVE this product and would have been unhappy if forced to change to something else.
3,Watch out for iPod Classic use,"I used this for over a year with my 30GB iPod Video. Worked great, although I did get static in some areas.Now, I have the 80GB iPod Classic, and I am noticing that the way the two items work interfere with each other. The way that the Belkin ""tunes"" in to radio frequencies causes the new iPod to pause and play songs in rapid succession for several seconds. This isn't serious, but it is very annoying. It doesn't happen all the time, but it does happen enough times to notice on long car journeys. We shall see if this problem becomes annoying enough to change transmitter devices in the near future."
1,Do not buy!,My wife and I just bought this yesterday and we are going to return it tomorrow. The audio quality is descent at best. The main problem is that we cannot find a frequency to play the ipod through. The slightest signal will overpower the Belkin. Even strong radio static overpowers this worthless piece of junk. Please do not waste your money.
1,not compatible,Not compatible with the new iPod Nano(the 3rd gen with video). DO NOT BUY this if you recently purchased the iPod nano and want to use this in your car
4,Very useful in car entertainment,Good design. Works fine with my car stereo. I wonder whether it would be forward compatible with iPhone.
1,Nope.. this doesn't work well,I tried this with my 5G Video iPod in my Toyota 4Runner and was very unhappy with the results and the product was returned. I opted for the Tuneflex version from Griffin that uses the cassette attachment (included). I've been quite happy with the Griffin Tuneflex version and would recommend that for those with a cassette player. Search Amazon for 9865-TFLEX5G. Also... my wife has a Nano and it works in this also.
5,Its Good!!,This Book gives you a basic idea on what to expect performance wise from various loads through testing and real world incidents ..
5,Clearly defined markings,"My favorite thing about this square is that it has the most defined markings of any square I've used. The square has an overall feeling of ""quality"" to it. It also comes with a pretty complex user manual.Experience level in relation to this tool: low"
2,A pep talk in written form.,"I don't really recommend this book. I would say that the 1 star guy above put it pretty well. It doesn't contain insight beyond what the average person already knows (like most books in this category... written down common sense).It is encouraging, the authors are enthusiastic, that's for sure. Unfortunately their biggest success appears to be the marketing of a book on achieving success."
2,Don't rely on the reviews for the Hardback version,"All of the reviews (before mine) for this paperback book were from the Hardcover version when I bought it. When I originally purchased this paperback version, the reviews didn't have the notation that they were from the Hardback version.The Hardcover version must have been 1000x better in quality than the paperback version because the photo prints are horrible. There is no detail. The art of the photographs is good, but the print quality looks like it was printed using a 1990 HP Laserjet printer (if you ever tried to print a photo from one of those, you know what I mean).Although it was quite cheap, it wasn't worth $1. Don't bother buying it (paperback)."
4,Some great films here,First of all I'm very glad and thankful these films are finally on dvd (some were never available on vhs). I agree with another reviewer that putting more than one movie on a disc would cut down and the packaging (and therefore price). Seventy minute films on single discs? This would sell much more at $30 rather than the price they are selling.
5,another group of classics,I was impressed with the quality of the dvd's. The fact that most of the collection were originally made in the 30's the reproductions were excellent
5,What took so long?,"I grew up in Southern California. WC Fields was on the late movie a lot. I missed schoolkid sleep to stay up and watch. In those days, there was only one TV in the house, in the living room. I would awaken my parents laughing and get a good scolding. To me, any Fields movie was a riot, worth repeated viewings.For years, only the Bank Dick and It's A Gift were available on VHS. Suddenly, these collections appeared at Costco. I was shaking with excitement.My old friends Franklin Pangborn and Grady Sutton, in addition to Fields. I'll be the first to admit that some of the material is weak. I really don't care much for Poppy. But I'd still rather watch ""bad"" Fields. The one with Edgar Bergen & Charlie McCarthy tries your patience, exept when Fields is on camera. The ping-pong game!Fans of Fields will buy the collections regardless of what anyone thinks, so reviews are beside the point. Let me assure you Fields fans, your life is not complete without these."
4,Remembered Fondly,"I was asigned this play as a senior in high school (many years ago) and remember it fondly. It is a re-telling of the bibical story of Job, and takes liberities. Anyone who is uncomfortable with the Christian Old Testament in general or re-tellings that take liberities: be forewarned.Another reviewer suggested reading aloud improves the experience. I would second that suggestion. No need to re-hash the plot. I just wanted to say, in defense of the play, that I found it extremely interesting and thought-provoking. Especially the different ideas regarding what proper religion/spirituality consists of that were brought out by JB, his family and friends."
5,GREAT SERIES,"I first checked out this book from the library. I liked it so much, I went looking for the next one book. I found out there were 5 altogether, but the libray didn't have them. So I searched Amazon and downloaded them to my tablet, which was a gift from my husband."
4,Abundant Rain Review,"I had read ""Former Rain"" and accidently started reading the 3rd installment in the series before I realized that I needed to know what happened to Elizabeth and Kenneth. Abundant Rain was written in such a way, a reader can feel the emotions of the characters as they find their way back to each other. A story of hope and restoration. I look forward to more stories from Ms. Miller."
4,Useful little book,"This daily reinforcement of the Seven Habits is a good tool for your morning or evening reflection time. The book consists of excerpts from Covey's 7 Habits, and is arranged generally in the same order as the original book. The reinforcement it provides is a good way to keep yourself focused on the principles Covey espouses. Each reflection will take about 2 minutes to read, and the book itself is small enough to be a good travelling companion."
1,Simply Awful,"This is the worst book I have ever read. It's poorly written and its usefulness is little more than common sense. If you watched one infomercial on weight loss, you already know whats inside this book."
1,Not worth the money,Another author trying to capitalize on people who are obsessed with developing a body that it leaner than is necessarily healthy.Most any diet that is low enough in calories combined with proper exercise will enable one to achieve reasonable leanness.This particular diet is nothing new. It is just another variation of the cyclic low carb diet recommended by various other authors.Reports of good results following this diet are purely anecdotal and cannot be relied on.All this book does is to cater to insecure people who are obsessed with body appearance such as those with eating disorders.Not recommmended.
5,Effective Low Carb Dieting for Intelligent People,"I can't add much else to the positive reviews already posted, except to say that anyone who's looking for a systematic, scientifically based, and effective way to lose bodyfat should buy this book. No hype. No BS. Just straightfoward, realistic and readily applicable information."
2,Cheaply made and too short,"Disappointing - quality was just really poor. The fabric is barely ""fabric"" at all, and is horribly scratchy on the inside. The cut is so short that is shows your rear if you bend to pick something up, so you really have to wear this with a white mini underneath."
5,Strange but amazing!,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this book and I'm not quite sure what to think AFTER I read it. All I know is that this is ONE. GOOD. BOOK! I was caught ""off guard"" once I found WHY the man was actually in his basement but that just made it all better.The more I read by Mr. Mosley the more I find myself loving his work. Saying this man has a talent for telling a story is almost an insult. I HIGHLY recommend this book!"
4,easy listening,I have loved Michael Franks for years and especially this album. I recommend this album for anyone who likes easy listening.
4,"Great Album, Great Sound","Received this great album pretty quick. There were no skips or warps, and I'm glad to have it in my collection. Packaging has some minor wear but the vinyl is in top condition, no scratches or scuffs."
1,I'm simply amazed,"Clearly everyone and his dog has had his or her nose buried in this book for quite some time, but I didn't get to it until it was loaned to me by someone whose opinions I respect, then recommended by another friend in the same category. Oh my goodness. I'll acknowledge that I only read three chapters. The writing was so bad I just couldn't get any further. Combine that with the assertion, in the third (and my last) chapter that a spring evening in Paris was ""winding down"" prior to 1 AM (as evidenced by the main, purportedly, character's observation that he had been asleep 20 minutes prior, which time was given as 12:32). A small detail, yes, but evidence that this author has so little respect for his audience that I would not invest any more of my time when there are actually well-written, non-pandering books out there to read."
1,Mid-Life Mystery: Nancy Drew meets Encyclopedia Brown,"Did you ever wonder what happened to those young crime fighters when they grew up? Now you know. A murder brings together Sophie the 30+ cryptographer and Robert the 40+ historian forcing them to answer a series of riddles and puzzles in order to solve the caper. The puzzles have all the sophistication of writing in lemon juice and reading messages in the mirror. Can you think of a five letter word associated with Sir Isaac Newton? If not then you will be left spell bound by cryptic hints like ""we could use some fruit from the tree of knowledge to solve this one!"" Except for the occasional references to sex to remind you this is adult fiction, this is the Hardy Boys all over again."
3,The Da Vinci Code - audio CD read by Colin Stinton,"Needed more than a single reader, especially for female voice. English accents done badly."
1,biting his lower lip,"Dan Brown sits in his study, biting his lower lip. ""I think it is all true. I.. think... just... don't know anymore."" He sighs and stares out the window as the stubble on his chin catches the moonlight reflected off of The Louvre. It will be light soon. The wind whispers warnings as it passes the Eiffel tower.If you liked this you'll love the book."
4,truth or just controversial?,"Yes, this is a very controversial book. But it did open up some people's eyes (such as myself) and began asking questions about the church and Christ's personal life. This book plays with your mind as it keeps throwing facts and evidence. A good read."
1,Incredible poor research,"While its not that poorly written, this is by far the worst book I've ever seen when it comes to research. People concerned about condemning the church or setting up Mary Magdalene as a cult figure may enjoy it as a potpoiler, however if one is into somewhat real history this is a laugh.I just can't understand the fuzz about it, whether its from Christians or conspiracy believers. This book is just not worth the effort. People believing this stuff about e.g. church history or ""80 gospels"" will believe anything, without needing to check facts or alternatives. ..."
5,Great read!,This is one of the books that really got me into reading. Seemed like I couldn't put it down!
1,Bad Writing Trumped by the storyline,"In short the plot, or the idea behind the plot (the research, etc.) was of more compelling interest to the writer then the actual writing, character development, etc. This is the kind of book that one finds in the library of a rented summer house. It is ideal reading while sunbathing of on a rainy day when there is nothing else to do. If you have seen the movie, it will help with surviving the bad writing."
1,Incredibly Poorly Written,"This book is for the weak minded, easily entertained lot. I found it boring, contrived, at times cheesy/hokey, and very poorly written. Everything needs to be explained to the point where the text loses its momentum. The villains are laughable, the way the main characters figure things out is so damn contrived that I found myself laughing out loud. People who are getting mad about how it goes against the Catholic Church and all this other nonsense, I have one thing to say to them: Don't bother! It's a waste of breath! This book is so bad that it really doesn't challenge your religion at all!I honestly hated it, and find it sad to see that it is such a monster best-seller"
1,Poor translation?,"Ok, I have neither bought nor read this 'book', and never will, but I read the excerpt.If English is Dan Brown's first language, then he has major problems, unless he is a 10 year old slow learner. Ok, he has made a lot of money from this piece of rubbish, but why not take a quick course in creative writing beforehand to learn the basics of style.The Hardy Boys books are advanced literature in comparison!"
2,Cleverly misleading,"I read this book in one setting, which is a testament to this book's ability to keep one's attention. Nevertheless, anyone with a little knowledge of religious studies or art history will find Brown's blatantly erroneous accounts of Christianity's development or Da Vinci's work unsettling. He comfortably weaves such falsehoods with fascintating historical information in such a way that the average reader will be unable to distinguish the two. At best this is manipulative, however, at its worst, it is grossly deceiving and unprofessional."
2,Much ado about very little,"I have to give Dan Brown credit; he had a great idea for a book. But he has neither the skill or the ability to carry it out. I can't find anything in this book that justifies the enormous hype it has received. The quest for the Holy Grail, and what the Grail actually represents, is fascinating, but Brown tries to wrap it in the stale trappings of a pedestrian whodunit that doesn't do the material justice. The characters are one-sided and don't really engage us, and the writing is just plain sophomoric. The idea of Mary Magdalene as the wife of Jesus isn't original with Brown; it's been done much better by other writers, most notably by José Saramago in ""The Gospel According to Jesus Christ"". I came away from this book with a deep sense of disappointment. Brown had a good idea for a book, but somebody else should have written it."
3,Entertaining read but not much else,"Fiction has gotten more interested in fast and cheap thrills. While ""Code"" is a good read, it conscientiously brings the reader to turn pages through use of short one-two page chapters and outcomes that are only casually disguised by superfluous reasonings. Regardless of the facts and conspiracy truths, Dan Brown's writing is simple minded and seems to be engendered toward the reader who has only a bare minimum time for sitting down with a book. No thought required, other than remembering what you read in the previous page."
2,Just not a good story,"Ok, Dan Brown, we know you're smart; stop hitting us over the head with it! Why don't we use some of that energy that was used in all those puzzles and plot twist to make some likable characters. Heck, I'd settle for un-likable characters over these flat stereotypes. There was a very smart idea in this book. But instead of letting it shine dully through a well crafted novel, Brown lets it blind blatantly without any sort of veil. I felt like I was at a lecture at some points in this book. And when it did that, this novel lost any saving grace. I love learning new things when I read fiction, but more than anything I love a good story and the Da Vinci code was severly lacking in that department. Online customer, save yourself the hassle; I'm sure a movie is on the way, save the time and fork up the 7.50."
2,Not what I had hoped for . . .,"I read this book just from the perspective of wanting a good mystery to read - the religious 'accuracy' aspects didn't concern me. And - it simply didn't hold my interest very well. The plot seemed fairly lite, and the characters weren't well developed. I probably scanned through about 1/4 of the book's pages. I suspect that Dan Brown recognized that the religious implications of what he wrote would make the book sell - and for that he is correct!"
2,Good idea but wish Brown was a better writer,The story was interesting and it was definitely and quick beach read but Brown's style of writing detracted from the strength of the book
5,A great vacation read!,"A friend told me to read this. I noted that Nelson DeMille gave it a great review and I enjoy his books when I am reading my ""fun books"". It was an excellent vacation read which I devoured in 2 very late nights. I loved the cryptic clues and entanglement with the Catholic church and the ""true"" life of Christ. The characters were engaging and plot twists were fun. This is not a candidate for any literature prize but it is the best fiction I have read this year, beating Crichton, Lehane and DeMille. I didn't read his other books so I can't say if this is predictable if you have read him before. But if you haven't, pack this one along for a great summer read."
1,not so good,"Low grade fairy tale. I understand what people are saying about it ""just being a book"", but Brown himself claims the historical references are fact. Actually, they are not fact and the stretches of conjecture used are rather insulting propaganda. Why do people reward this? The people that like this book say it makes them think, but if it made us educate ourselves about history then Dan might deserve his money.It's easy to be condescending to readers that become angry at ""a work of fiction"" but the book is not presented as fiction and many readers are believing it.People should be saddened by this book and what it represents but instead they turn their attention and anger toward a movie that teaches love and compassion in the face of brutality. What does this book teach? All teachings require faith - which deserves it more? (Borrow a copy - it seems that everyone is buying it.)"
2,"Well, it's OK, but no more than OK","Don't believe the hype.Eveything about this book is less than you've heard: the history is deeply flawed, the art history is questionable at best, and the theology is ludicrous. But of course, the book promises to be no more than a thriller, and it doesn't even succeed at that level: anyone who can't spot the real killer has no experience with potboiler fiction.This seems to be the kind of book--I believe Michael Crichton started the trend--that is written in order to be turned into a movie. I'm sure it will be a success; and equally sure that I won't see it until it appears on Showtime.Read Eco's Foucault's Pendulum to see how a much better author treats similar material in a much more sophisticated way."
5,Excellent read,"A great read. It hooks you in from the beginning. Dan Brown weaves a great story around the the theories of the Holy Grail, Catholism and art. I really enjoyed this book."
3,"Somewhat predicable, having read Angels and Demons first","I agree that the DaVinci code is a fun thriller that is hard to put down. I was so intrigued by the review (especially a positive comparison to Katherine Neville's ""The Eight""--one of my favorite books which I am now re-reading) that I decided to read ""Angels and Demons"" first. That was probably a mistake, since many of the plot elements in DaVinci code mirror those in his earlier book. ""The DaVinci Code"" is a much better book than ""Angels and Demons"",but I was able to guess things about what was going to happen based on my reading of the previous book. This only could occur because of the very strong reliance on the same plot elements from the very first scene with the hero getting a nocturnal call to immediatly view a dead body mired in symbolism, his meeting a young women who turns out to be related to the murder victim (grandaughter, vs adopted daughter) and so on. I don't want to mention any others since they might give away the plot."
1,You've got to be kidding me!,"OK, I'm not opposed to the possibility that Jesus Christ was married and had a child, but much of this book's views on current religions are very insulting! Most of the ""evidence"" that the author relies on is flimsy at best. Some of the theories he presents on various symbolism are intriguing to contemplate, but they are very weak as presented in this story. As far as the story involving a French Cryptographer, what was the need? There is nothing more complicated in this mystery than a few grade school riddles and a simple rotational substitution cypher. If the Priory of Scion was seriously trying to protect their secret, why would they pick passwords like sofia and apple? And to use the Fibonacci series of numbers for your bank vault password is ridiculous! The only thing good about this book is it might intrigue some to do more in depth research on some of the topics highlighted in the book.Oh, and can you say double entendre again???"
5,The best book I've ever read,This is the best book I've ever read. It was both suspenseful and simultaneously educational. What a great way to convey information about art and religion that may otherwise bore the average person. I could not put this book down and I was sorry when it was over. I am looking forward to reading more Dan Brown novels.
1,Is my species really this stupid? What a boring piece of garbage!,"I decided to read this book one recent afternoon so I could legitimately comment on it and well...I'm just shaking my head in disbelief that 60 million imbeciles have not only shelled out real money for this literary Ambien but actually enjoyed it. And yet the talentless fair-haired boy, Dan Brown, just keeps smiling vapidly and watches the cash keep rolling in, to my increasing frustration. Even putting aside the blasphemy and the_monumental_bald-faced lies about historical figures, we're left with plenty to object to in the forgettable characters, the convoluted and boring plot, the laughably predictable plot ""twists"" (he employed most of them in ""Angels and Demons""), and the bland, puerile writing. I just don't get it. I just do not get it at all."
1,AN INSULT TO INTELLIGENCE,"Yeah I read ""The DaVinci Code"" Wanted to know what all the fuss was about. No question it IS a page turner. You will finish it quickly. I also read fairy tales quickly when I was a kid. The story is a fantasy. In fact the entire ""wild goose chase"" in the book takes place in France and England, through the Louvre, hyper secure Swiss banks, french countrysides, English airports, the Westminster Abbey, you name it -- all -- in less than 24 hours. Go figure. Paleese! Look I'm not shocked or insulted over the religious ""revelations"" but give me a break...make the darn story feasible! A total waste of time. Save your money."
2,"All shock, no awe","Well, I finally read it, just to see what all the hype was about. And I was VERY unimpressed. And, no, it's not just because it ""challenges"" ""traditional"" Christianity. It's because the so-called ""challenge"" was so weak. Even just a little bit of historical research blows Dan Brown's theories out of the water. Constantine collated the New Testament --- really? Who does he expect to believe this junk. The gross historical inaccuracies aside, the writing isn't very good either, honestly. There was a lot of potential for a good novel here, but he wasted chapter after chapter preaching and trying to persuade the reader. Just not a good book. I did, though, enjoy reading his ""Angels & Demons,"" which has a similar focus but a much better story and much less time using his soapbox."
4,Lives up to the hype,"I was reluctant to read this book since it seems like everyone else did and was raving. In the past I have been disappointed by books that were getting big attention. An example is ""The Lovely Bones"". Anyway, ""The DaVinci Code"" lived up to all the great things I heard about it. Fast moving and it makes you think."
2,Quick fun but...,"Sure it is well researched. Sure it is a page turner. But it really is the equivalent of chocolate cake: I can't put that down either, but the pleasure is fleeting and it leaves me fat and lethargic. This is a fine book for a 6 hour airplane ride."
2,An action movie without the special effects,This book reads like an action movie but without the benefit of any special effects to keep your attention. The concept of the plot is novel but the writing is poor and descriptions are lacking. Be sure to read this as long as you have nothing better to do.
1,Disappointing,"I am not an expert on the historical backdrop of the book. Even if one were to assume that the background the author provides is accurate, the book itself is very poorly written. The book feels like watching a really bad action movie. Each chapter in the book is approximately two pages in length. Furthermore, successive chapters are different threads in the plot. This leads to disruptions in your thought process.In my opinion, the hype surrounding this book is unwarranted and the book is certainly not worth a read."
3,Choose your own adventure,"The Da Vinci Code is an enjoyable read, complex and creative, for a page-turner.The characters do not lead normal lives (eat, sleep, experience emotional conflict etc.) The author has a police cryptographer and a symbolist pursuing a murder, chasing grail clues and being chased, by an albino, by the police and, in turn, by the murderer. They take planes, trains, armoured trucks and various automobiles, which are magically at their disposal whenever they hit a dead end.At any rate, the book is flawed and full of misinformation about Leonardo Da Vinci, Mary Magdalene, the Catholic Church and related splinter groups. I don't know how anyone could be seriously offended by such a superficial treatment of art interpretation and religious history.That aside, it was fun to try to solve the codes and clues left along the way and see which path the author chose to take for the next episode."
2,Interesting premise but poorly plotted,"I read this book because it was in the listing for our book club. I thought it started well, but petered out pretty quickly. The characters are poorly drawn. Plotting is weak. Not much happens by way of story. Mr. Brown the teacher seems to have triumphed Mr. Brown the author. Reach Foucault's Pendulum instead."
3,Not up to the hype,"I enjoyed the book and found the premise to be facinating. Good thing, because the details are tough to get through--very technical in some aspects.Unfortunately, the hype surrounding the book somewhat spoils it. Even more unfortunate, Dan Brown (author) does not draw a clear line between historical fact, his own hypothesis, and sraight out fiction. The reader, will need to read all of this with a grain of salt. The storyline has just enough elements of truth to be plausible, but not probable. Remember, IT'S FICTION!"
1,Take away the controversy...This book really sucks,"I am convinced that Dan Brown is a angry lesbian. Actually I would guess that Dan Brown's wife is a angry lesbian. Seriously if you just read this book and forget all the ""lame controversy"" that this book tries to create you will find that The Da Vinci Code is very poorly written. It reminds me of some dollar store mystery novel that should be thrown away and never be talked about. The characters are hardly interesting, the dialogue is poor, and the facts in the book were not researched at all. If you are thinking of buying this book grab a screwdriver and stab yourself in the foot. If you do buy this book take a look in the mirror and I guarantee you will see a overwieght lesbian women probably in your 30's with a bad mullet and a long upper-lip 'stache. It's your decision -make the call"
3,DAVINCI CHODE,"This one is really a page turner. It is about a man named Robert LaFollet, an ornithologist who finds a code written on the beak of a rare penguin. He takes this code to his friend Leonardo DaVinci who uses ""the davinci effect"" to descramble it. It turns out that this code reveals a secret that ""totally debunks religion"". Finally, with religion debunked once and for all, our hero runs to the helipad and flies off in his ""ornith-copter"". Overall, it was good but the sad fact about this book is that I found it overrated. Still, it presents important veiwpoins about religion and the nature of reality."
3,Controversy Sells! Let's all start a Secret Society,"I enjoyed the book, but then, again, I knew I was reading fiction.I do think the controversy this book has stirred is most fascinating. He did a great job with the ""secret, forbidden"" stuff--it made for a good story if you like a nice ""scavenger-hunt"" mystery. As I was reading it, I knew those who are a wee bit fanatical about their religion would be offended.I'm not sure if Brown was deliberately too liberal with taking ""poetic licenses"" or not. But, for those out there who think that this book is true, just a little research or even a couple of shows on A & E will clear up quite a bit of that for you.If you like fiction that is just fiction, read it."
2,Neal Stephenson For Dummies,"A great premise and fascinating historical religious esoterica are married to a pedestrian mystery and monochromatic and predictable characters. Brown is what Harlan Ellison would call an ""author"", as opposed to a ""writer"". He is capable of producing easily digestible, and therefore popular material, but his work has no literary merit. A typical MTV attention span is ideal for optimum enjoyment. This would actually be a good beach/airplane read. The reading experience would be enhanced by crying babies, people noisily noshing cheap peanuts and occasional turbulence induced nausea."
5,Leonardo would have liked it!,"The Da Vinci Code is a very good mystery/thriller, tying many historical facts and historical theories together in a modern background. Politics, religion, deceit, international intrigue, all rolled together in a compelling story. There are many unexpected twists and turns in the plot, and the reader never knows what will happen next. The book is hard to put down, and the characters are believable and likeable. A highly recommended book."
3,Good read although implausible and a bit amateurish,This book is a good read. I read it in one sitting. My main criticisms are: 1. The priory of sion is really a hoax. 2. It is too politically correct and contrived. 3. I did not really care about the secret of the Holy Grail. 4. I never cared about the characters.The positives are: 1. Dan Brown teaches the reader a few interesting facts about some fascinating works of art. 2. The first half of the book is a good murder mystery.
5,A great read!,"while so much controversy surrounds this book, the illustrated version is the one to read. I found it to be enlightening, positive and filled with interesting historical perspectives. I enjoyed being able to read and easily see what is being referenced in pictures right there without having to go look it up. you will too!!Get this book!! enjoy enriching your mind."
1,DaVinci Code? read Holy Blood & the Holy Grail instead,"Brown's ""fiction"" is based upon an earlier bestseller entitled:Holy Blood and the Holy Grail by Micheal Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln. copyright 1982. Corgi Publishers, Great Britain. ISBN: 0-552-12138-XDaVinci was only one of the leaders of the Priory of Sion and this ORIGINAL researched information lists the entire order of the leaders right up to the present day and even shows a picture of the current living descendant of Jesus."
4,Statistics,So far this book has sold over 40 million copies and has 3126 customer reviews.This means that an average of one reader every 12.795 writes a review on amazon.com about the book after buying it and reading it.Im just making statistics on best sellers and trying to understand how things work... one day I may write one :) so remember my name :|Obviously this statistic doesnt take under consideration the books that you can read for free from the libraries that have been borrowed from friends and that have been illegally photocopied or downloaded from file sharing softwares... but gives you an idea...
3,He fell asleep for last half of this one....,"What a great premise and outstanding first half. Midway through this one, however, Mr. Brown simply seemed to give up. It's unfortunate because he really stumbled on a cool concept. If at any point you're reading this one and you find yourself dozing off, you should probably put it down.... it just continues to go into a tail spin from there."
3,"It's not too bad and by the way, it's FICTION","Definitely written for the newspaper article attention span masses, the 1 to 3 page chapters will keep most readers lockedin.The rest of the audience is no doubt:* Conspiracy theorists* Feminists thinking that there's a message somewhere in the book* Religious righters searching for a reason to post another `my lord and saviour' passage on the internet* Mystery novel fans - like meCouple of good twists and an easy read. Forget all the hype and enjoy a decent book for the heck of it."
3,Conventional Quest Narrative,"This book is more a compendium of Mr. Brown's considerable research of his subject than a compelling novel of fiction. The protagonists' quest is formula, and I knew who ""the Teacher"" was very early in the book. Dialog seemed stilted, as well.Methinks not nearly as much a thriller as advertised."
3,Only if you're bored,"I've read a few reviews on this book and I think the overall average review for this book is pretty accurate. This book reads pretty fast, which is good. For those who didn't get pass the 2/3rd mark you were smart. The ending, as usual for Dan Brown, was disappointing. I just have 1 word, ""Hollywood."" After reading Angels & Demons and Da Vinci Code I have to say that's the last of Dan Brown for me...unless he kills off Robert Langdon. Of course, if the anti-matter, the Hassassin, or any of the secret frats couldn't kill the little nerd I don't think anything or anyone else could...except Mr. Brown himself. The one bright spot was this book was an improvement over Angels & Demons."
1,The Da Vinci Code,"I guess I am alone in my opinion. I thought the bookgot off to a great beginning, and that I was really goingto love it. I was learning a ton about Opus Dei, the TemplerKnights ect.Then it got ""silly"". One moment I thought,""I've had enoughof the divine feminism bit"", and the next moment after one more""escape"" excuse me they get out of the limo at the airport withthe bound albino without being seen (?) I could see the promo---and starring Harrison Ford.My daughters and I had selected the book for our annual wine andbook discussion summer visit. I hope they liked it better thanI did. If I hadn't committed myself to the evening, I wouldn'thave finished it."
1,"Stupid, Absurb, Ridiculous and Overrated","I thought that this was one of the most stupid books I ever read. The plot stunk. The history so faulty it was laughable. The characters were boring, underdeveloped and tedious. The riddles were the most ridiculous and predictable. The conclusion....ho-hum.Don't waste your time"
2,The Illustrated Da Vinci Code,"This is a magnificent book. My only complaint is its size, due to wonderful pictures. This makes it difficult for this semi-invalid to read. But is so interesting, that I will manage somehow!"
3,"3 stars for plot, but substance ...","I would recommend this book for plot, historical fact combined with a contemporary story, and puzzles contained within. The problem I have is with the liberties Mr. Brown takes on several serious religious theories. Jesus having a child, etc. There are books that approach this story utilizing more traditional religious theory on the Holy Blood, the Royal Bloodline in France, and the quest for the Holy Grail. Try a book titled THE GOAT WITHOUT HORNS."
3,what's the big deal?,"OK book, but was not an easy read for me as I am not familiar with Catholic concepts/practices. Hard to separate fact from fiction. I'm curious what his source is for the bit about Jewish priestesses."
4,What's Next? OEDIPUS?,"OPUS DEI is an anagram of OEDIPUS. I'm surprised they missed that one. Robert Graves and others claim the source of the classic Greek OEDIPUS is Akhenaten. Rosicrucian Leader Spencer Lewis identifies Akhenaten as a prior incarnation of Christ. Osman claims Akhenaten was both Moses and Oedipus. And Freud is convinced the Jews killed Moses in the desert as they killed Christ in Rome--the classic patricide or Oedipal complex as performed by a cultural group. There's plenty of psuedo-history, myth and innuendo out there for a sequel :)"
4,Alot of fun.,"I tend to be a fairly slow reader, usually I can't manage more than 30ish pages or so a day from a book, this one had me doing 100+. Regardless of all the hype and fire and brimstone around this book, I thought it was fun to read, especially as many of the puzzles were fun to play along with."
3,Great read - easy to follow,A great read that seems to go by quickly. The story is well thought out and you are entrapped from the first few pages.
4,The DaVinci Code,This is a very great book. Although it is fiction it does make you think. But on the flip side to that I didn't really care for what it ended up suggesting once revealed. Dan Brown sure has a very strong imagination and works so well for the book. Too bad hollywood destroyed a great book. The book is something that rivets you to keep on reading. I lost many hours of sleep at night because it was so riveting.
1,I fail to understand the hype...,"After all the media acclaim and recommendations from friends, I was really looking forward to reading this book. And was *sorely* disappointed. In the first place, I think Katherine Neville, Umberto Eco and others have dealt with the subject matter much more skillfully - not to mention coherently. And in the second place, I found it to be simply a poorly written novel. Yes, I admit that it's plot devices were entertaining but the book is one plot device after another with absolutely no character development. The novel's ending I found to be ridiculous and to render the entire novel pointless."
3,"Good, but not that good","I enjoyed this novel and it does qualify as a ""page turner."" The plot is certainly more intriquing and original than most mystery fiction. But the characters are straight from central casting and one does get the feeling the book was written with a definite eye towards selling the movie rights. A high-brow plot, but written for the masses. Doesn't deserve the hype, but not a bad read."
4,Completely engrossing!,"When was the last time you read a thriller that made you compulsively want to discuss it with friends, neighbors, other people in a restaurant?Using a fairly standard thriller genre, Dan Brown packs it so full of fascinating scientific, historical, and art facts that you will constantly be hitting google to look for more information.As in: I've got to see a print of The Last Supper immediately! What kind of airplane is that? I've got to find out more about the Priory of Sion right now! Where's a map of the Louvre?The reader is given a chance to solve the puzzles before the answers are revealed, and the plot line is so compressed (the whole book takes place in under 24 hours) that you never get bogged down.Great for thriller fans or art fans or religous conspirators!"
1,why all the hype?,"I was very excited to read this book, as I had heard many excellent things about it. However, everything about it after just a few chapters was disappointing. The characters were flat, the plot was highly predictable, and the writing style left much to be desired. My only guess is that this book is selling on the sensationalism of the secret society. If you're looking for worthwhile reading, this isn't it."
1,The Da Vinci Code,"No stars for this one. But would not let me submit unless I put in at least one! I understand that this book is a copy of the book called, ""Daughter of God"" which is about the BEST book I've read this year and I don't do fiction usually. I write myself (Bible research) and I don't think an author copying someone else's work is worthy of reading.Okay, so ""Daugher of God"" has some unusual things in it (me a Baptist). But if you don't stretch you're mind once in a while you will never learn. Take a chance - be brave."
4,interesting,I could not put this book down. This book was a very interesting book to read. I believe Dan Brown did an unbelievable job. the only problem I had with the book was the ending. I was enjoying it until the end. I believe he could have ended it in another way.
3,"Overrated, at best.","As suspense thrillers go, this one is ho-hum. The first half of the book really drew me into the novel. Unfortunately, I had to slog through the second half of the book to finish it. Brown's pedantic suspense devices became insufferable, and the plot fell completely apart. His religious commentary is sophomoric, and I am amazed that this novel has gotten the kind of press that it has. This book really doesn't merit a second thought, much less an episode of Dateline. So, I am bewildered by this book's popularity. It is a ""just okay"" read, so check it out from your local library. I can't imagine why anyone would want to own this one."
2,okay read if you like revisionist history,"Okay writing, mediocre thriller. I'm not a Catholic, but I am a Christian and I find the vast majority of the conclusions Brown leaps to in this book laughable. Take the Last Supper analysis for instance. That is not Mary Magdalene seated next to Jesus. It is St. John painted in the same beardless effeminate manner that Da Vinci painted him in his St. John the Baptist portrait. The hand and knife belong to St. Peter who would later use a knife to cut off the guard's ear in the garden. Peter is leaning hard on his left elbow to speak to John thus projecting is left hand out.Brown might be right about one thing ""Everybody loves a conspiracy theory."" So if that is you, buy the book."
2,A Big Mac for the mind,"This book is a roaring good read, which is reason enough to spend a couple of evenings with it. But the author's facts are skewed and some of his assertations are just plain silly. (If that's who he says it is in the center of the painting with Jesus, then why was James, brother of Jesus omitted from the gathering of apostles?) You've heard of junk science? This is junk history. Enjoyable, but not very nourishing for the mind."
5,A book that would leave you breathless with delight!!!,"An exceptional book of immense dimensions....truly a must read....a well researched , highly engrossing , intelctually stimulating , a fast paced thriller delving into forgotten history...... words cannot describe how fascinating a book this is!!!"
1,Intrigued by Da Vinci Code? Don't be. Please.,"The idea wasn't bad. But the writing is horrendous. And the dialogue - dear God.If you're looking for a real intellectual thriller, don't despair: Umberto Eco, Arturo Perez-Reverte and Sebastien Japrisot provide some of the very best, and they actually do research. Nikos Kazantzakis' ""Last Temptation of Christ"" is brilliant for those interested in alternative theories of Jesus. And Strunk and White's ""Elements of Style"" is an old classic that Dan Brown should have glanced over once or twice."
3,Da Vinci Code,"Though this book and the movie are already old now, I have just read the book and must say I was disappointed. I wasn't that crazy for the movie either. Though the concept is very interesting the book read like a lecture, and the characters were weak. I was bored by the middle of the book.I'm hoping ""The Lost Symbol"" will be an improvement. C. Lovell"
3,Fun Read,"Just finished ""The DaVinci Code."" It was fun for what it was - a romp through history. However, if you're interested in rollicking reads based on Grail lore, try Umberto Eco's ""Foucault's Pendulum."" As I read ""The DaVinci Code"" I kept in thinking that it was a dumbed-down version of Eco's book. The parallels are interesting; Paris, Knights Templer, Sofia . . .That said, Brown's book is a fun read. If you're new to Grail lore it's a pleasant introduction. If you're a humourless hyper-Christian, stay away."
2,Oh my goodness---tedious hardly covers it,"I give it 2 stars because I actually finished it. With a final sigh of relief I turned the last page and closed the book for the last time.Plot holes, cheap tricks of suspense, wooden characters. You name it--the logic is faulty and sometimes downright weird. Oh, and let's not forget the author's not so hidden agenda with which he likes to wack the audience upside the head excruciatingly about every page or so.This is a strange theological and semi-historical exploration thinly disguised as fiction. Brings to mind ""The Celestine Prophesy"" another new age book that, to the credit of ""The Da Vinci Code"" I was not actually able to stomache long enough to finish. But it was a best seller too. Go figure."
4,Illustrations Helpful and Interesting,"If you are deciding between the illustrated and normal versions of this book I would recommend the illustrated. My only complaint about the illustrations is that the ""last supper"" is spread out on two pages with the crease in a critical location.The book itself is a fun, fast, interesting read. I would highly recommend it. I did like Angels and Deamons slightly better because I felt the ""bad guy"" was better developed. I felt a lot of sympathy for the ""Bad Guys"" in this book, which is not necessarily a bad thing."
3,Too predictible,"The premise of the book is intriguing and the history presented made it a real page turner. The big disappointment for me was figuring out the final cryptex code well before the book's noted symbiologist, historian, and crytologist."
1,good and bad,books goodfiction goodsuspence thriller fiction books gooddan brown baddan brown books worsedan brown thriller novel the davinci code the worst
4,The Da Vinci Code,"I enjoyed it very much. Couldn't wait for the next disc. I know it is fiction, but all said and done, it made you question your beliefs, and what you were taught. With all that is going on with the Catholic Church today, makes you wonder if some of the fiction was actually true."
5,Fascinating!,The Da Vinci code is a fascinating fictional interpretation of the history of Catholicism and the actuality of the Holy Grail. The only way one can love this book is to not take it completely literally but to read it for what it is as a whole and allow yourself to be absorbed into its story which really is classified as fiction. It's not so much an attack on the Catholic church as simply a different perspective from a theory claiming that the lifestyle of Jesus and the actions of the Catholic church in the past may not have been as we thought. It is definitely worthy of the wave of attention it has brought about and is highly recommended.
1,P T Barnum was right,If only I had 1000 acres of Florida swamp land; I would solicit all of the folks giving this hardbound nonsense a 4 star review. This book reads like it was written by a National Enquirer staffer. Truly a side show that would have made Barnumdrool.
5,Favorite!,Read this book years ago and it is still to this day one of my favorites!! It is a definite page-turner!
4,Good Book!,"Very interesting story...even if you saw the movie and did'nt read the book, don't let the movie ruin it for you, READ THE BOOK! The movie did not do it justice.Happy Reading!"
1,Pabulum for the under-educated,"This book is awful. No, really, awful. Just put it down and go read something else. Anything else will certainly be better. And likely less insulting to your intelligence.I understand that the puzzles were supposed to be part of the charm. I suppose if you like the puzzles, you can be forgiven. For me, this book was made up entirely of predictable drivel that lead nowhere I haven't seen handled better elsewhere. I didn't need to spend time on the puzzles as their answers were as predictable as the rest of the plot."
2,Over-hyped,"I listened to this book on CD because so many friends recommended the book. I'm not a mystery reader but thought I'd give it a try. Why all the hype? The book includes one tired cliché after another (His blood ran cold. No wait! Now his blood is boiling!). And somehow at just the right time the main characters stumble across exactly what they need to advance their investigation.And the audio recording? Egad. The reader outdoes Inspector Clouseau with the phony French accent, but this isn't supposed to be funny.My advice: Skip it."
1,Say What?,"Tolstoy, Doestoevsky, Dumas, Dickens and Brown? Give me a break! This forgettable piece of pulp has nothing in common with the works of those great writers. I could hardly bring myself to form a sentence (incomplete though it is) that included those five names.For those who defend the DVC because it is fiction after all, I have to say that at least half of my book club, bought the thing hook line and sinker and they are intelligent people.Brown is a hack and worse he is dishonest. Where is this guy anyway? Why doesn't he emerge from his sanctuary and answer some of his critics regarding his declared ""facts"" and research. Better for sales to keep the mystique alive, I suppose.Next month my bookclub selection is going to be ""Crime and Punishment."" The richness of Doestoevsky should, if not clean the groups collective palate, at least smother the nasty taste left by Brown's foul effort."
1,Are you the lowest common denominator? Then this book is for you!,"I'm a fan of trashy pulp literature. I'm a fan of great books too, but trashy pulp literature certainly has it's place on my bookshelves. The Da Vinci Code however doesn't deserve the paper it was written on. Dan Brown writes like he's writing for children."
2,Weak and disappointing,"For a thriller billed as intelligent, I was disappointed in how easy many of the clues were to figure out. As supposed experts in their fields, the characters should have solved several of the puzzles much more easily. When the reader figures out the clues before the characters, it makes the story development slow and frustrating.The writing style was pedantic and plodding. There are other books on this topic written with more flair. Give this one a miss.If you'd like a similarly detailed historical over-the-top mystery, check out The Eight by Katherine Neville."
3,The Movie Could Be A Blockbuster,"THE DA VINCI CODE is a suspense thriller which at first glance seems to have all of the necessary ingredients for success. The plot includes ancient secrets, shadowy organizations, powerful people, the Holy Grail and even Mary Magdalene. The trouble is that the book is too long and padded with boring details.The story, however, does have the potential to be made into a blockbuster movie."
4,"A brief précis in reply to "" Real Junk""","Actually I haven't read the book yet ( but you can count on it now!). I am here to give a short rebuttal to the person signed as "" a reader"" from Brookline, MA ( see Real Junk, October 18). This reviewer says: ""...there is no such profession as 'symbologist'..."" - But YES there IS dear reader! And -surprise,surprise- one of the most famous of those, certainly the most visible in the public's awareness, is none other than Professor Umberto Eco. who is a specialist is SEMIOTICS, which deals with the language (and of course, the meaning) of ""symbols"" of all kinds. What Brown has done,was simply to call it (this profession, that is) another name. My point is that such profession DOES exist and is enjoying excellent health. I thought you'd like to know."
3,Seen It Before,"Maybe the plot was ruined for me by my having played the computer game Gabriel Knight 3 a couple of years ago. It contains the exact same conspiracy theory, with Mary Magdalene and the Templars and the Merovingians and subtle hints in artwork. Everything - just from a slightly different angle. Frankly, I think the game made a more complex and satisfying mystery out of the same research. The Da Vinci Code was an entertaining read but like some other people here, I found it annoying when the characters displayed extreme stupidity in order to stretch out the plot for longer. And you just know this novel is destined for Hollywood when you find product placement ads for SmartCar in it. (Have you no shame, Mr. Brown?) It's not a terrible book, but I was expecting more meat here."
3,"Used ""Sophie"" vs. last names of men","I thought this book was quite a page-turner and I enjoyed the religious conspiracy premise, but there were some annoying flaws that downgraded my rating.Cryptologist Neveu is referred to as ""Sophie"" throughout the book while all the male characters are referred to by their more professional last names only. After all the talk about revering the sacred feminine! (probably mentioned before but I can't read all 900 reviews)#2, the blindness these educated characters displayed when confronted with a simple mirror-writing clue was utterly ridiculous!I thought the writing was average quick-mystery turnout quality with more in the way of plot, but again, it was a ""fun"" book to read for those of us who weren't already up on all the conspiracy points. Go ahead and read it! It won't be the best book you ever read but you'll enjoy it and be able to get in on all the buzz."
2,Cranking up codes,"Brown does it all over again: some intriguing ideas, good writing and a not so new story. For those of you who are fans, go ahead. As for the rest, you may want to either pick up a less convoluted novel or a real religion history book.By the way: some people could find the novel straightforwardly offensive..."
1,"Oh, Please!","When I got to the fourth line of the first chapter and read ""hand-frescoed walls"" I knew I was in trouble at the hands of a very careless writer. How else would the walls be frescoed? By feet, robots?We find totally wooden characters, ludicrous cliff-hanger plot twists, lumpen exposition, red herrings not worthy of the worst of Agatha Christie, and puzzles which could be solved by an intelligent seven year old. And just when, during this long night, did anyone get the chance to go to the bathroom?Why, you might ask, did I bother going on? Well, it was at least more interesting than the in-flight shopping catalogue in the seat pocket in front of me on my 6 hour flight yesterday.The majority of raving, enthusiastic reviews that I read here leave me deeply gloomy about the intelligence of the reading public."
3,"Gripping, but poor writing,","Because of the hype and the amount of people who loved The DaVinci Code, I decided that I had to read it -- I needed to see what all the fuss was about.I would be lying if I said that this book wasn't hard to put down, because it definately was gripping. This is why I gave it 3 stars. However, his writing was far from up to par. My favorite authors are people like Tom Wolfe and other intelligent FSG writers who know how to tell a story but also manage to write really well. Brown really needs to work on this. I also felt like at times he was just pulling facts out of a hat and throwing them at the reader, maybe to show off, but who knows?This is a good book for an airplane ride, or a vacation where you want something light and enjoyable. Look for nothing else in this book."
4,Great book,"Recommend this book. Great read. If you haven""t read this book yet go ahead and pick it up. read it"
1,A waste of time,"I haven't read a book this bad in a long time. The writing was poor, the topic was sensationalistic, the characters were stilted and often unrealistic, and the ""revelations"" the author makes about the artwork were not all that revealing. I had to force myself to read it and when I was done I actually threw it away I hated it so much. I'm relieved to know other people didn't like it either. I thought I was the only one in the country who wasn't in love with it."
2,Not a new story plot,"I found myself thinking of Umberto Eco's book, ""Foucaults's Pendulum"" as I read The DaVinci Code. The plot is certainly not original, but a variation of Eco's work, at least for me. I am a fan of Da Vinci, and checked out the story for that reason, but Eco had the main idea first."
2,The Da Vinci Disaster,"Interesting for the first 100 pages. After that, the plot quickly loses steam. I expected more theory and research, much in the way Graham Hancock writes in ""Fingerprints of the Gods,"" or ""The sign and the Sea.""Here, there were absolutely no references to where Brown received his information. His theory is interesting, yet is merely an opinion. THe book contains interesting ""side-notes"" of academic worth, but even these are not sufficient to salvage the disaster that is the main plot.Though provoking, yet highly disappointing."
5,An entertaining novel or a secret truth revealed?,"From the moment I started reading this book, I found it hard to get away from it. The storyline is beyond any suspense novel I have read. The story leads off with the murder of the Louvre Museum's chief curator. His death unfolds a turn of events that leads us through a path of intrigue as the story of a private society overshadows his own death. In the end, his very own daughter must place together the clues he left as she follows the path of her father's codes to discover that this society had a rather impressive list of members throughout history to include Da Vinci and Isaac Newton amongst other historical geniuses.Now comes the twister that has engulfed the world. Is this book a fictional tale for entertainment or is there some truth to a secret society that historians have refused to acknowledge?"
2,Really - how did this become so popular,"I don't know which is worse, Brown's writing or the fact that he based the book on something that was proven to be a total hoax. It boogles the mind that Brown stands behind the material as factual when there is direct evidence that story was a hoax. If you do any real background research, you'll find out quickly that the Priory of Scion was an organization created by 3 Frenchmen in the 1950's. The individuals who pulled this prank freely admit they did this as a joke and never expected it to go so far. Enter Dan Brown, a second class writer who falls for a previously disclosed hoax. I cannot believe that so many people (mainly Americans) bought right in to an openly fabricated story. On top of the story being completely fictional, the writing style is dreadful. Do yourself a favor and read something by a legitimate writer, you'll be better entertained."
2,DaVinci Commode,"I finally succumbed to the will of friends and read this garbage. While at times quite the page-turner -- in a formulaic, manipulative way -- the superficial treatments of the ""great mysteries of the ages"" dismantle the whole premise. I'm certainly no cryptographer as the hero is renowned to be, but I was figuring out the ""clues"" long before any of the characters were. And the argument that the Bible was a matriarchial text before King James got his hands on it is an old one, so nothing learned there."
3,What Is the Big Deal?,"Yes, ""The Code"" is inventive. Yes, it is fast-paced. Yes, it goes on & on, twisting & turning with a new old twist around every corner. This is a summer read, not a read that breaks new ground."
2,Good Story Poorly Handled,"The mix of reviews here is an accurate index of what this book offers. If all you want is a fun mystery and conspiracy story based on intriguing and alleged secrets in the history of Christianity, you'll get it. Discerning readers will be disappointed. The book reads like a Marvel Comic stirred up with soap opera and B movie scripts. Believable characters, action and dialogue - in short, good writing - would make it far more worthwhile."
3,Good read,"I'm not sure why this book is number one on the bestseller list right now. It was a good, fun read, but not 'beats 'em all' caliber. If you're expecting something written in brilliant prose to knock you socks off, don't. But if you're looking for a good book to read, pick it up. It's entertaining, thought provoking and fun. If you don't read it with your expectations sky high because it's number one, then you'll probably enjoy it for the story it is."
2,The Da Vinci Code,"I remember my creative writing professor saying that the Da Vinci Code wasn't all that good, and that Dan Brown didn't have the best writing style. At the time I Just thought my professor was jealous because he is also a writer though not as well known. Once I read The Da Vinci Code, I realized he was right. Dan Brown has a very simplistic style of writing. I did like the fact that he kept his chapters fairly short, but the way he goes back and forth between characters and point of view is tiresome after a while. As for the plot, it started out alright, but towards the end it just got so predictable. I knew exactly how Brown was going to end it and who play what role in the outcome. It was an okay read but I don't think it lives up to the hype."
3,"Entertaining read, but no wows from this reader.","The pacing of the story is great. The author certainly manages to grab your interest at the end of every chapter, forcing you to continue reading to satisfy your curiosity. So I was never bored. But I was expecting brilliance and instead I found that the mystery and the puzzles were just ok. The characters were mediocre. Even though some may find the religious topic thought provoking, this book doesn't require deep thinking. I read this book very quickly. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't heard all the rave reviews. Entertaining read, but no wows from this reader."
1,The Da Vinci Code,The story was much better the first time it was written by an author named Lewis Perdue under the title of Daughter of God.Do yourself a favor and get the original.
2,High hopes ... but disappointed,"I had high hopes when I started this book. Being a scientist I was intrigued by the symbology, numbers, codes, etc. But I have to say I was sadly disappointed as the book progressed. Not only are the heroines in this book exceptionally BRILLIANT (they can solve complex puzzles in a matter of seconds which many could not solve over millenniums), they are incredibly lucky ... always getting out of impossible situations perfectly. The book was shallow, predictable and too neat. Everything fell into place within a of matter pages - where is the suspense in that? Give me some depth.One positive ... a good book for a coast to coast plane ride or a beach vacation."
1,"Inaccurate, plastic characters, & pregnant with intolerance","This book is slander, Calumny and Detraction all rolled up in one. Someone wrote a review saying this book is ""only fiction."" I want to ask them, If I wrote a fictional novel in which they were portrayed as a notorious bank robber, murderer, and sex offender would they still say ""It's only Fiction?"""
1,a real stinker,"What boring characters these are, running and jumping like little automatons through a nonstop but lame series of chases. Utterly devoid of suspense or good storytelling."
1,Don't waste your time,"Absolutely horrendous; poor writing, predictable plot twists/characters, and a tired, worn out story. If you've read this book and think otherwise, you should do humanity a favour and jump off of a tall building."
5,Excellent Service!,"Am pleased to say that the above item was posted & received in Australia within 3 weeks from date of purchase! As expected it arrived in brand new condition, still in packaging & brilliant read! Excellent Service! Would recommend product, business anyday!"
3,This didn't captivate me....,"This book didn't do it for me like it did alot of people. I feel it just didn't flow like the other books do. I found it a struggle to finish, but in direct contrast is ""Angels and Demons"". I decided to give Brown another chance, frankly, because I read the first few pages in the book store and found myself racing to get home to read it. It seriously captivated me and I usually do not go for this genre. Love it!"
1,Beyond the hype,"This is a fairly quick moving thriller up until the midpoint, and yet I kept thinking I had read this all before. A voracious reader, I rarely stop reading books until I have finished, but I was sorely tempted with this one. Even ignoring the strong anti-Christian rhetoric, the ending was so weak that I was left asking myself ""So what?"" Not a good use of your money or time"
1,The Da Vinci Hoax.,"Here in Brazil, I went to a house of one of my friends and I tried to read this trash-book.Being so bad, I never finished this trash-book.I don't know if this is a romance, a pseudo-historic, an anti-catholic bigotry.I realize that this a ridiculous, absurd and bigoted book.There's so many historical absurds, in this book, that I can't number all of then, in a single chapter of it.The real title for this book must be ""The Da Vinci Hoax""."
1,Cryptonomicon for dummies,One time I ate a Krispy Kreme(tm) doughnut; one thing lead to another and I ate the whole box. That same feeling hit me when I finished this book. You will finish the book and ask yourself why?
3,Fair thriller,"I'm still not sure why, but I read stuff on planes that I'd never pick up normally. This is a great example of that genre. A complex murder scene sets off an incredible chain of events. At every step, each revelation only deepens the mystery and widens the array of forces set up against our protagonists. The plot turns into a collision of shadowy religious cult and historians intent on establishing facts that could shock the world, under pressure from an international police chase.The book did what I wanted - it passed the time, and amused me better than the bland in-flight movie could have. The heavy mix of fact in with the fiction helped bring the story to life for me. In the end, though, it's just another thriller.//wiredweird"
1,The research is terrible - there is no truth in this book,"The research for this book is terrible - it is all based on total rubbish so far as any understanding of Christianity is concerned. No historian, whether atheist, Catholic or Protestant, or simply agnostic, would give this book the time of day so far as factual research is concerned. Yes, if you want a science fiction thriller, like Raiders of the Lost Ark, this kind of nonesense is fine, but don't believe a word of it as fact"
4,A Riddle Wrapped into an Enigma,"JFive stars to the author who develops such a magnificent imagination. He says that all references to the past are true. But, as they say in Italy: If it's not true, it surely is well invented.Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu try to do what countless savants over the centuries tried in vain: Find the Holy Grail. The Vatican gets involved and, of course, Opus Dei. Jacques Sauniere, curator of the Louvre, is murdered early on. Apparently he was the grand marshal of the Priory of Sion, and they know where the Grail is. Robert and Sophie progress from anagram to double entendre riddles, on and on for over 400 pages.The red herring going through it all is Mary Magdalene and the cult of the Sacred Feminine. But, after a while, you do get tired of fabulous and saintly Mary M. and all the feminism. And the ending of this very large book is rather silly."
2,A Pleasant Time-Waster,"The Da Vinci code is, as they say, ""a good read."" That's about the best that can be said of it. I think Dan Brown's writing is cliched, stilted, and heavy-handed, and his characters are transparent stereotypes. But there is no denying he can weave a story that holds your attention, like -- well -- Robert Ludlum or someone of that ilk. A ""good read,"" but not great literature."
1,Overrated crap,"This book could have been a fantastic read, but I was so disappointed in it, I almost didn't even finish it! The beginning was exciting, I couldn't put it down- however, by 2/3 of the way through, it was just mindless, predictable garbage. I wasn't expecting this ""historical"" novel to be factual, but it was still a disappointment."
5,"If you're very religious, don't bother, you won't get it","This book was phenomenal. Period. End of Story. I have recommended it to every person I know and they've all loved it, except 2 people. The only 2 friends I know who did not like this book, are both religious bible-beaters born and raised in the South. They can't get it through their heads that the church isn't perfect and there are actually other theories and relgions out there. So, if you can open up your mind and put your religious beliefs aside for one second, then you'll love this book. I think the movie is coming out in 2005."
1,Had high expectations,So much hype for a formula X cliffhanger novel.Silly but with just the right ingredients to feed the masses...This is Twilight for Grownups.
3,Disappointing,"If this is an intelligent mystery, intelligence is losing ground. The writing was awkward, many of the riddles were predictable, and the religious theories were heavy-handed. The book was a little too much like a rambling manifesto of conspiracy theory; its passing mention of minor symbolic points (The suits in a deck of cards are symbols of the sacred feminine!) detracted from the force of the more interesting points about religious iconography."
1,What a waste of time,"This novel is very poorly written, I could hardly stand to read it. Save you time and money."
1,Murr on 'The Da Vinci Code',"The 'historical research' on which this nonsense is based could have been done by anyone with half an hour to spare and a good internet connection. In spite of the note at the beginning making claims to historical precision, the book is full of descriptive errors and historical inaccuracy. For example, the secret society described in the novel, the Priory of Sion, was in fact a complete hoax which was invented in the late 1950s by the famous confidence trickster Pierre Plantard, and not dating from 1099 as Brown wants us to believe. Don't bother wth this. It truly is rot.[...]"
1,Shame on Doubleday,"I just read in The New York Times Magazine for July 20 that this book has been successful ""both commercially and critically"" and was giving Doubleday ""a terrific spring""; also, that Dan Brown ""could become another brand name novelist"". I must have read a different book. The ""Code"" I read was filled with interesting facts and allegations re the Catholic Church but the plotting was so weak it was embarrassing. In fact the plot was so poorly done, I couldn't help comparing it to the The Celestine Prophecy which is a truly awful book (much worse than ""Code"") that was a great commercial success. It is a sad commentary on the publishing industry that Doubleday decided that ""Code"" was the book they would make into a bestseller.Forget ""Code"" and buy anything by Alan Furst, a wonderful writer (see the July issue of Harpers)."
2,Overrated,Read it to find out what all the hoopla was about. I'm still not sure. The literary equivalent of a pet rock.
2,Waste of time!,"A suspense thriller that reminded of my pre-teen days when I read Nancy Drew! This book managed to keep me reading and wondering what would happen next (got a little boring towards the end). There are some aspects of it which made me think it may be true and kept me going back to the web for research. The know-all, do-all Sophie and the her partner Robert Langdon are our to find the Holy Grail. The book starts off well with some aspects of history that may surprise you, if you have not already watched it on the television. But in the end, its just way too predictable."
1,"Warning: Not for devout Christians, Catholic OR Protestant","I began this novel knowing only a small bit about the contents, not having visited here prior to purchase. If you are a Christian, Catholic or Protestant either one, this is not the book for you. Blasphemy disguised as intellectualism. What's so sad about it is that people who haven't studied the Bible and its history will believe the fables therein. My main question after reading the novel is, if Christ was merely a normal man, not divine, not God's Son, then why would his bloodline be of Royal Lineage? Makes no sense whatsoever. His bloodline only matters if He is God's own Son, as He claimed."
4,A Definite Must Read,"I think a true example of a talented author is one who can deliver a serious message while wrapping it inside a most entertaining story. Dan Brown has achieved exactly that. This is the best mystery novel I have read in sometime, and the revelations that Brown submits are fascinating. It has encouraged me to study Da Vinci, The Bible, The Templar Knights and everything Renaissance. This is one book that everyone, especially Christians, need to read. The story DOES NOT lag in the middle, that is where all the good stuff is. I promise you will not de disappointed."
2,A Tale Lost in the Telling,"Intriguing plot nicely complimented by interesting factual details. However, the prose peaked at mediocre and often descended into low juvenile."
1,What happened ?,"I first read the da Vinci code when published, a few years ago. I really did enjoy it.As I felt like reading it again, I bought on Kindle store and read on my device.What a disappointment: the e-version / new version (?) is quite different from the first published: many things have been either changed or deleted.What happened ?Has the novel been censored ? and why ?"
2,Entertainment value only,"Three people recommended this book to me so with anticipation I read it over the course of a few days. It is an acceptable mystery that moves along although some of the dialog is amateurish or maybe just aimed at the poorly educated reader. There is quite a bit of repetition so that at points in the novel where I would normally have read very carefully I was able to quickly breeze through because I knew the same idea would be repeated several times in the next few pages.The symbolism uses such loose associations that it is difficult to believe if not downright scary that people buy into it so thoroughly. Finally as only a wedding, funeral, and holiday churchgoer the ideas about the early days of Christianity were of little interest. When the movie is released, I will be sitting at home reading something more thought provoking."
2,Predictable,This book has a formulaic plot and poor character development - Perfect for a Hollywood B-movie. A page-turner which is basically a treasure hunt with predictable riddles flavored with religious secret society conspiracy theories.
2,Falls way too short of the mark,"I finally succumbed to the lure of the Da Vinci code, finding the premise an intriguing one and mistakenly thinking that any book that had been on the bestseller list as long as this one has deserved a look.The first half of the book kept me turning the pages, getting swept into the breakneck pace, but the psuedo-intellectual intrigues began wearing thin quickly after that. I'm afraid it just got too much of a stretch that the 'bad guys' were always just half a step behind the 'good guys' no matter how many fantastic escapes they pulled. It felt more like ""The Perils of Pauline"" written by a theological think tank.A nice try, but there are too many unlikely twists and a plot hole large enough to drive a semi through."
1,No Thrill from this supposed Thriller. : (,"The book is what I would categorize as an *easy read*. I sailed thru it in no time. So many had told me the ending was a ""shocker"". I agree, it was a shocker, only because I was shocked that I had figured the whole thing out by the middle of the book. I felt the plot sophomoric. I found the history interesting and the interpretations fun, but in the long run I would not recommend the book to anyone who likes a good mystery that is tough to figure out, cuz this ain't it! I will agree that it is an engaging book and it is difficult to put down once you begin, but in the end it was a let down."
2,"Such buildup I had to read, that will teach me.","This seems to be the book of the year and shows no signs of slowing down. I was excited to read it, but that came to a grueling end as I trudged through Brown's ""research."" My college freshman English professor would of marked down my paper with such flimsy research. It took me all of two minutes to find on the internet that the sect Opus Dei does not even have monks. One of the main characters of the book could not even exist, so much for Dan's research. I also would question that five million women were killed as witches in the Middle Ages. My research could only find that maybe 15,000 died, while sad, not close to the 5,000,000 stated in the book. As for the story of Mary Magdalene and Jesus' marriage, that has been around for years and is nothing new, as most of the reading public seems to believe. And just because Dan says it is true does not make it true. I had such hopes for this book and was sorley disappointed."
2,Interesting theories but a boring book,"The religious theories in the Da Vinci Code are fairly interesting though the amount of truth in them is only known by men long dead, and if there is some kind of successor to this knowledge they have yet to come forward.The one aspect of the book we cannot doubt is that its entire plot is nothing more than a predictable, thinly veiled premise for long-winded monolouges by the main character - a man we not only don't know, even by the end of the book, but one we don't care about. While Brown may have a lot to say about the Catholic church he has little to say about his characters.This novel seems mostly like an easy way out - Brown can get his beliefs and theories into general circulation without citing sources or offering proof by putting them into a popular novel. Brown proves to be a poor historian and novelist."
1,Unfortunate,"The Da Vinci Code was an absolute disappointment. The characters are undeveloped. The plot is predictable. The writing is uneven. The best part is the historical detail. But even that is many times inaccurate and twisted to fit the plot.Save your money and buy ""The # 1 Ladies Detective Agency"" instead."
3,A Facinating Story of Mystery from the Christian Era,"This book has had much hype, but it is an interesting read no matter what your religious beliefs. Much intrigue and wondering."
2,An absolute scream,"This book is a hoot from start to finish. Having researched Opus Dei, the Knights Templar, Holy Blood, Holy Grail, and the facts known about Mary of Magdala, I thought it proposterous from start to finish, but very clever. I bought copies for friends so they could laugh at it. That anybody would ever take it seriously never occurred to me. To write something like this, you have to take egregious liberties with historical facts, and have utter disregard for the reputations of people living and dead. A laughable story. That it would be so widely successful never occurred to me. Dan Brown, enjoy it while it lasts. Any time an author scores like this, the rest of us have to be happy for you! You have pulled off an incredible joke on everybody! Anne Rice, 1239 First Street, New Orleans Louisiana, 70130"
1,Unreadable.,Possibly the worst book I've ever come across. Normally I will try to read and finish a book however bad. I like to finish but this was really hard work and eventually I just couldn't take it any longer. Why? Unreadable.Loads of publicity and complaining from the church made this book popular. Dreadful.
3,"Captivating, yet disappointing","I picked this book up at the airport after having many friends tell me to read it.The book was very captivating and a good mystery, but I was offended by some of the references to the Catholic Church. Although Dan Brown researched parts of this book, other sections were inaccurate and led to the downfall at the end of the book. If you do some research on the internet regarding this book, and read some reviews from newspapers, you will come to find out that the book isn't as exciting as originally thought."
5,Excellent,This book was amazing!!! I finished it in 2 days. You won't want to put it down. It's an excellent book to read for book groups. You'll find so many things to discuss!! I highly recommend it!!!!!
1,Formulaic and predictable,"A quarter of the way through I realized why this book is such a page-turner. Brown uses a tried-and-true formula for keeping the readers going, even when the story lapses into incredible implausibility. Develop a series of mysteries within a bigger mystery and keep the reader interested by making every chapter a cliff-hanger. One mystery solved leads to another mystery to be solved. Etc., etc., etc. Now that seeing how it's done by a master I'm going to write a similar novel, make a million bucks, and retire. Unlike Mr. Brown, however, I won't bother writing more than one bestseller. I'm not greedy. I figure one good bilkering of America's dumbed-down readers is enough."
1,This book is TERRIBLE,Please don't waste your time with this book. It's just so lame. The characters are barely there--names on a page. The plot is lamer than lame. Embarrassing. Horrifying to see how many people like this book.Read the Name of the Rose if you want to read about Christianity in a fun way. Read anything but this book. The codes are not that hard to figure out except for one that involves another language.The book is totally pseudo-intellectual. I don't understand why people think it's good. Really baffling.
2,The Devil is in the Details?,"While The Da Vinci Code IS a page-turner and the premise seems promising, even fascinating, this book is really just a beach or airplane novel disguised as high art. The mingling of some fact with a lot of fiction will leave most with more questions than answers, or worse the belief that much of what Brown passes off as legitimate undisputed theology is actually the truth. If you're still interested in reading it, the good news is that you can do it in an evening or two and move onto something better!PS I completely agree with the reviewer who complained about the publisher's review spoiler; many reader reviewers do this as well and I, too, think Amazon should effect a policy against this practice."
4,Nice Vacation Reading,"A fun book to read and you must be careful not to get caught up in the fiction and believe what Brown is writing. This book is titled ""Fiction"" for a reason. I highly recommend reading this book just because there is some history you can take from it. I learned a little about art, paris, and the pagan religion. Some Christians may find the book offensive but you just have to realize you are reading this for the adventure. I just noticed that Amazon has lowered the price too, this is a great deal for the price they are offering. Go ahead and pick up Brown's Angels and Demons while you are at it. This one in just as interesting if not more. Angels and Demons will keep a Catholic turning pages!!! Enjoy!"
1,Catholic Bashing Lite,"I have just finished ""The Da Vinci Code"". What an utter waste of time! Dan Brown adds nothing to the murder mystery genre with this book. Furthermore, the entire premise is implausible as the key element of the mystery, the ""Priory of Sion"" and its guardianship of the Holy Grail has been proven to be a complete hoax. Mr. Brown's biblical scholarship is shoddy, his analyses of the artworks of Leonardo are facile and, of course, he provides no motive for the secret, which has been kept for so long, to be kept. I am truly amazed that this book has received as much attention as it has. I am sorry to say that I wasted my money on this book. A much better read would be Umberto Eco's ""Foucault's Pendulum"" or ""Badolino""."
5,Great Story,"This is a wonderful adventure that is often misunderstood as pure fact. It is a page turner and very difficult to put down. The illustrations are incredibly helpful if you aren't too sure what they are referring to like myself. They are also beautiful. The book itself is quite large so if you enjoy bringing books with you on your travels, this one is quite difficult to lug around. The chapters are very short which makes for an easy read for just about anyone. I love a book that can take one meaning and flip it around to have another meaning that comes out of nowhere. Some of these things may be from the research Dan Brown had done, but many are just from good writing. A thrill to read, highly recommended."
5,Page turner defined!,"This book masterfully combined all of my favorite themes - history, secret societies and ACTION! I tore through the pages more engrossed than I had ever thought possible. The obscure connections through history and geography fit together ingeniuosly. Very impressive."
1,This Code is Not Worth Deciphering!,"This is a run of the mill novel mixing old fashioned Catholic bashing and New Age nonsense - it's a wonder so many readers are willing to park their brains to find ""meaning"" in so lightweight a book. In 454 pages, this book has 105 ""chapters"" - even the author can't string enough nonsense together to write anything more than a few paragraphs at a time to make his feminist/religious points. This ""Code"" is just not worth deciphering!"
2,Conspiracy theory,"O.K. people, remember that this is a NOVEL, not a history book. It is nothing more than a conspiracy theory which an uneducated, gullible public will easily swallow as history. Don't be fooled. Other than it's poor attempt at re-writing history, it is not a bad read. It does get a little preachy at times, and the characters are flat and predictable. It is really the conspiracy theory posing as history that carries this book."
5,First rate historical thriller,"This book is topnotch, although a bit laden with schmaltz. I loved it anyways."
3,CODE,Interesting yarn! The author blended a fascinating mix of fact and fiction. I hope he continues his work in the future
2,Awkward and Uneven,"There's no arguing that books on and about Da Vinci's hidden clues and Knights Templer are not only very pertinent but very compelling as well. Dan Brown's approach to the subject is via a story line which is stilted and awkward. Sadly, The Da Vinci Code's disjointed narrative detracts from Brown's great personal wealth of knowledge on the subjects. Author Brown would have been far better served to have written a direct treatise on the facts as they exist rather than try to string them all together via a plot line which, for the most part, was trite and forced. But hey, he's a published author and I'm not."
2,"Interesting fiction, but just that - from an atheist","The Da Vinci Code is a decent book, and I've to commend anyone who questions religion (although Brown's really just criticizing religious authorities in this case). The story is slow and repeats info, but at least there is a story. I don't believe Brown's version of history, though, just as I don't believer any religion's."
2,Trite and formulaic,There's very little else to say about this book. It would have been a 2 or 3 star book - but it lost one star for the relentless (dare we say inane?) press that proclaims this book as some messianic roadmap through history. It's an easy airplane read for when you want to kill some time (and maybe a few brain cells) but aren't looking for anything of particular import.
2,Disappointing,"I read Angels&Demons which I loved. Went out 3 days later to buy this book, and was very disappointed. It was a decent read, but fell short of its potential. It was a good plot, but very underdeveloped. Angels&Demons seemed to flow and the story seemed riveting from page to page. The DaVinci Code had its good points. However there were times when the author seemed to drag the story on. Buy it at discounted price if you want to read it, but it is not worth the full price of a hardcover book."
2,Hyped to death....,"As Edgar Allan Poe said about 'Pilgrim's Progress', ""ludicrously overrated book,"" and also in the case of 'The Da Vinci Code' the film is even worse!"
1,awful!,"There is very little to be said in favour of this novel: it is a rehash job with a bad plot added to it, it is badly written, it lacks research (and provides lots of false information) and contains no characterization. Why on earth was this a bestseller? And why are all the main characters so useless at getting the clues?Anyone can point out the factual errors, but which young French Parisian woman would ever utter the following: ""You're kidding, right? We're going to visit a knight?""What a waste of money! I can only hope it kept a few ignorant Americans amused on their cruises - or that it encourages them to visit the Temple Church (based on the Church of the Sepulchre in Jerusalem, which I suppose is pagan inspired, too ...), etc., etc."
3,good for a car ride and afterwards to persue real research,"It's neither as good nor as bad as many of the reviews claim. I had great fun reading it on vacation. As a theology student, not everything mentioned by Brown is completely impossible, especially if one considers that what we have as the Bible and Christian tradition comes out of the social biases of the last 3,000 years and that they are incredibly patriarchal. One bite I have is that his characters conclude that if Jesus were married then he could not have been divine (away with the incarnation, resurrection, etc.). Maybe it's not that black and white. ...Have fun reading it and then DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH."
2,Who wrote this stuff?,"It is amazing to me that this book is a number one best seller. I guess I shouldn't be surprised, when murderers of the language like Tom Clancy and John Grisham can be at the top of the list. The writing in this book is TERRIBLE. Although the intellectual puzzles posed are interesting, it is completely implausible that characters under such stress, lack of sleep, etc. could suddenly have the solutions to these puzzles dawn on them. In addition, the plot has more deus ex machina moments than the entire history of Greek theater. Very disappointing, and not even a good read."
2,So easy a caveman could have read it...,"This book was written at a surprisingly amateur level. This book wouldve been a much better read about 15 years ago, and i am 29 now.The writing was so incredibly tame and a Geico caveman wouldve had no problem getting through this book.The characters were also so incredibly uninteresting. I did not care one bit for the two main protagonists. I didnt care if they lived or died since they had absolutely no back story in this book. The only character i enjoyed was Silas who seemed to be a poor ignorant man mislead by zealots. He would have been better served as an atheist who went to S&M; shows to get his blood running.On the plus side, this book was a fast paced read and i was very curious as to what the holy grail was going to turn out to be. However, after the whole holy grail thing was explained i found myself going, 'huh?' and 'are you kidding me?'Good read for a high schooler. Not so much for an adult."
3,"a great potboiler, but nothing more","This is a great potboiler, a page turner, as they like to say. And why not, with chapters averaging a little over four pages per chapter and thrilling writing to rival Edgar Rice Bourroughs. (How many of you are familiar with the great Tarzan series, as originally written? And would you rely on these books for information on life in Africa?). But it's nothing more. And surely anyone who reads this book to discover what the reality is is in an advanced state of idiocy."
1,Beware the False Prophet,"Disclaimer -- I haven't read the DiVinci Code. I have, however, read quite a bit about the claims it makes. The reason for the one star is that Mr. Brown CLAIMS the assertion on the first page of the book merely means that the mentioned documents exist. Except, of course, on those days when Mr. Brown CLAIMS the documents prove the outrageous assertions outlined in the book.I was reading the Bible last night and came across 2 Peter Chapter 2. It states that people are susceptible to people like Mr. Brown, someone with no credentials in theology and someone who has clearly amassed a forture through his false teaching, because they are ""unstable"". In Biblical lingo, this means they don't know the Word of God, they haven't spent time in the Word. What a shame for them, and for America. I pray for revival almost every night. To those truly looking for answers, turn to God not to the Book of the Month (or even Year) Club.God Bless You!"
1,pass,"What is all the fuss about? At best this novel is a mindless page turning thriller. I admit the preface is intriguing, but the writing was so rudimentary I found myself wishing it was in comic book form...then at least I'd have a better description of the characters.I probably wouldn't have such a problem with this book had it not been masqueraded as 'the novel of the century' or 'the best book ever'.The only thing this novel left me wanting to do was tally the amount of times Mr. Brown used the word 'aura' and compare it to the amount of times he used the word 'the'...admit it, you're curious too."
1,I tried! I really tried!!,"I had heard so much about this book and about how fantastic it was. I tried, I really tried to like the Da Vinci Code, but I could not finish it.It has a great story line, and Mr. Brown could have created great twists and turns with it--but he ran out of gas. His style included a big twist (like a murder) in the story--then for twenty pages, the characters would talk about it. Another big twist; and another twenty pages of discussion.That, and the fact he took true facts, tweaked them considerably, and then presented them to the reader as fact.I would have even liked if the book if it had been well written, but it was not. Run on sentences, changes of person and numerous other discretions of writing made for a very choppy read.I really tried to like this book, but could not."
4,Ya gotta pay attention!,"This book reaches out, grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go. The author dug deep and did his homework. He even tells you in the Prolouge what FACTS are contained in his fictional work.One reviewer on Amazon says the anti religuos people will like it. I don't now how he got there. This isn't a historical account it's a great fictional story. The details are superb and the author writes in a style that allows the reader to instantly visualize the characters and the settings.You do have to pay attention the details are many but never cumbersome. This is a great book for the beach or a quiet room where you can start and stay with it for several chapters at a time. I've never ead Dan Brown before but I will again!"
5,A new twist on the lost art of relationships,"This book as changed my life! I did not know that simple things such as being genuinely receptive, accepting, appreciative and respecting of men would transform them into the ""princes"" they were born to be. I did not know how to accomplish these simple tasks. In her book, Kissing Or No Kissing, Flechelle Morin candidly tells us how to achieve this ""tour de force"" with concepts that are easy to understand and apply. If you are looking to be married to a good man, this is the book to read. I am married, and my husband has been more than willing to love, protect and cherish the new me! I am glad I gave this book and my relationship a chance. This book will make you think. This book will make you want to be this feminine, lovable, strong and intelligent woman Morin says we can all be, with a little faith, and lots of practice. Your commitments to yourself will empower you, and in return, empower all men around you. Try it. It works!!"
2,Don't spend your money,"For starters they have the same reviews on the firm as the extra soft. But with that being said this is not let me repeat NOT memory foam, it is just apiece of foam. Worth about 2.00. Do not waste your money."
5,Great cushion,"I love this cushion and carry it with me everywhere I go. It is smaller than most coccyx cushions and the memory foam makes it very comfortable to sit on. I like that one side is vinyl and one side suede-like fabric since I sit outside on steps or stadium seats that may not be very clean, and the vinyl side is easy to wipe clean. The cushion is perfect for the car because of the wedge shape. Recently I visited my orthopedist and he even commented on the cushion and asked me where I got so he could tell his other patients. I guarantee you will love this cushion."
4,A good product,"I bought this because of my broken coccyx. Before it, I tried on a ""Tush Cush"" and an inflatable ring. The inflatable ring is totally useless for me: (i) the 16"" diameter is too small for an average adult so that you cannot stably sit in it especially when driving; (ii) when sitting in it, the inside circle of the ring is pressed down, causing the outside circle to squeeze your buttock, making my pain worse. The ""Tush Cush"" is made of soft foam, so the second problem with the ring still exists. So my experience is that you want to choose a cushion made of firm (if not hard) material. The memory foam that this product is made of is a right material: it is firm, yet slowly mold to your shape. However, sitting for a relatively long time, 30 min in my case, will make noticible pain. So my advice is to try to stand as often as you can if you have a broken coccyx like me."
1,Don't bother!,"This cushion is so small and the moment you sit on it, the entire thing goes as flat as a pancake."
4,Nice service and good product,"This product is good and service of ASTAR is also good. this comes in three varieties firm, soft and extra soft Make sure that you choose the right one."
1,Is NOT a memory foam insert,"I am returning the cushion as it is not memory foam as represented in the description. The insert is a basic 'run of the mill' foam that flattens like a pancake when sat on. If your truly looking for pressure relief, look elsewhere. If you want to soften your chair, look elsewhere. If you want to spend money friviously, your found your cushion!!!"
5,Great small bike bag,"The Bell Road Stash Bicycle Handlebar Bag is exactly what I was hoping it would be. It fits my bike well without being too bulky or getting in the way. It is roomy and can hold several small items (sunscreen, sunglasses, etc.). You can take out the plastic to make it less stiff or keep it in to give it more form. The only thing I wish is that it would come in other colors."
3,a very truncated version of Bridge Baron 17,"This version has only about 5 tournaments - many fewer than the regular Bridge Baron 17. I guess that's what ""Express Edition"" means but wish I'd known before I ordered it. It's fun but the non-express Bridge Baron 17 is much much better."
2,Not so good ...,"I watched this movie after ""Laura"" and ""Bilitis"".It is the weakest of these David Hamilton movies.I would give ""Laura"" 6 stars if I could.""Bilitis"" might get 3. This one is lucky to get a 2."
5,Sir John Fisher's Naval Revolution,"An highly professional, but fascinating book to read. To be recommanded to every fan of maritime history, interested in the great changes happening at the beginning of twentieth century.."
1,Absurd proportions,"I ordered my usual size in pants and upon trying them on I realized that the waist width to leg width is absurdly disproportionate. The waist fit was perfect for the size ordered however, the leg widths are awkwardly wide. Keep in mind I am a weight lifter and my legs are thicker than most my size. Despite that, on your person they closely resemble the disgusting look of those Jnco pants that were popular in the 90s. Even in my extra wide internal metatarsal boots they appear strangely oversized. I had no intent of buying these for appearances, but rather for work.Unfortunately I ordered these while out of the country for work, by the time I came home to try them on the return window had passed. I suppose they will make for decent rag material.*Try these on in a store before buying online. Lesson learned."
4,Good Value,I gave this pair of Carhartt's away for Christmas. They were a big hit. I saved about $7.00 by purchasing them through Amazon.
2,Sizing very unreliable,"I have been wearing these pants for many years, beginning when they were only available in the Carhart brown. However, Carhart has now outsourced production to other countries. Last year, i ordered 5 pair in various colors. Every pair - identical size 34 x 30 - were cut differently. One pair, tight in waist and too long, another too wide in waist and too short, another correct waist but wrong length, etc. The green were made in Nicaragua, the brown in Mexico, etc, and the sizes seemed to vary by country of origin. So, extremely poor quality control. I ordered 2 pair this year, and had the same issue. So, unless you can go into a store and try them on, better get something else or be prepared to send them back and try to guess what size will arrive. I see Carhart is now advertising a clothing line as ""Made In USA"" so I guess they recognize the issue. Too bad. I really like these pants. But NOT recommended for on-line purchase."
4,Still classic Deep Purple,"This album is often lightly regarded when compared with In Rock, Fireball, and Machine Head, and perhaps deservedly so. Yet it is still the classic lineup of Deep Purple and that means you can bet your life it is going to be a damn good album. ""Woman From Tokyo"", the opener and the highlight, is one of the best songs Purp ever did. And there's other songs here that will reward repeated listenings by the committed Deep Purple fan."
4,Where heavy metal started,This has always been my favorite DP album. I still have it on vinyl but thought I would get the digital version. I think it has been remastered because it sounds better then the analog version in my opinion. I hadn't played my record in years so I had forgotten about some of the gems on here like Mary Long. Kids today talk about metal but what is metal these days seems to have so much less intelligence or emotion in it. DP and Uriah Heep were what started it all out.
4,Deep Purple on a bad day is still pretty good...,"By the time 'Who Do We Think We Are' was released, Ritchie Blackmore's reputation for being, shall we say, difficult was certainly known by anyone with slightly more than a casual interest in Deep Purple. If one can imagine the stress of trying to put out an album, to say nothing of a good one, under those circumstances, it makes the success of this album all the more remarkable. Contrary to the critics, fans embraced this as another fine effort and its continued popularity speaks for itself. If it lacked the originality of their previous three studio albums (admittedly it falls short in that regard), it still rocked, and effectively disguised whatever discontent the naysayers read into it. Honestly, I play this album as often as I do any other DP Mark II album and easily enjoy it just as much. Reading so-called professional reviews, one gets the feeling that hating a band takes on a life of its own at some point. Only a critic could explain why."
4,"Tokyo rock, it's one of `73's best from DP.","Blackmore, one of the smoothest and most melodic of the pre-Van Halen metal fretters, gives another fine performance on this, the final Mark II recording. Come, taste the band! Unique; well worth a listen."
3,"The ""Lost"" DP album","Who Do We Think We Are? is the forgotten DP album. The band is quoted as saying they were not satisfied with the finished product and there was inner turmoil going on during its recording in Rome (especially between Blackmore and Gillan). But songs like ""Smooth Dancer"" and ""Rat Bat Blue"" are enough to make this a worthy addition to any DP fans music library."
4,3 1/2 stars - not as good as the ones that went before,"This album is a weird one - after the triple-punch of In Rock, Fireball, and Machine Head (all classic masterpieces of the first wave of heavy metal), this one is a little limp. Part of it seems to be that Jon Lord isn't using the heavy Hammond-through-a-Marshall sound he pioneered on the previous three, but the songs and band in general don't gell as much. The hit single ""Woman From Tokyo"" is likeable, but a bit poppy and cheesy for the band, and not nearly as classic as (say) ""Strange Kind of Woman"". There's some decent, hard-rocking songs on this album (the middle 4 songs), but none of them are really as memorable as the stuff on their 3 previous albums - which are filled beginning to end with classics. So, not a bad album, but it just doesn't compare with their best."
1,"About ""Who do we think we are""","I think this album is way to floppy and poppy and the source and force from In rocks/Fireball and Machine head has completely gone. This band was one of the first in the catagory of Heavy metal, and this last DP mark 2 line up from 1973 is not. All the problems in the band surely determains that in this album,and that's why I only give it 1 star. Sorry, but if you want the spirit back in the band with dp mark 2 line-up Buy ""Perfect stangers"" & ""House of blue light"" which is one of my favorits...these 2 albums have everything and Gillians voice is better than ever:-)"
5,The Dead Bison Theory,"Excellent book. The one major difference in this book and other business advice books written is that Mr. Carte is real life. His advice is applicable in real world experiences and can be applied in actual business mangement situations. The Dead Bison Theory shows you that good management skills are common sense. My favorite part of the book is where Mr. Carte points out that the office is not your living room, it is where you make a living!!! A must read for all Experienced and New Managers."
4,Jazz Tinged Jam Sessions,"Contrary to previous post, this was not ""Hendrix' last recording session at Ronnie Scott's club in London"". These (edited) jam sessions were recorded March thru June 1969 in New York studios & released by Reprise Records in March 1980. These jam sessions show Jimi in a ""jazz"" setting, purely instrumental improvisation. Raw, loose, loud guitar playing. Not recommended for casual Hendrix fan, but if you want to dig deeper into Jimi's style, some of these musicians can actually keep up w/him.Tracks:""Message from Nine to the Universe"" - 8:45""Jimi/Jimmy Jam"" - 8:04""Young/Hendrix"" - 10:22""Easy Blues"" - 4:30""Drone Blues"" - 6:16Personnel (varies from track to track):Jimi Hendrix - guitarBilly Cox -- bass guitarBuddy Miles -- drumsJim McCartey -- guitarRoland Robinson -- bass guitarMitch Mitchell -- drumsLarry Young -- organLarry Lee -- guitar"
2,Shipping Cost OUTRAGOUS,"The sponge themselves seem great. Soft, big and appear to be able to stay together. I have only used them once or twice, so far so good. HOWEVER, I am so disappointed in the cost in shipping. I obviously did not pay close enough attention. For two sponge (which weigh little) to be shipped from FL to NY it cost $19.99. What a joke? It was not over night or express it was flat rate shipping and they charged that much. WHAT A RIP OFF. It is my own fault but still shouldn't the seller be some what honest on just how much they are charging. I will not be buying another item from Big Deal Beauty until they readjust their shipping rates."
4,"my first, but not my last","I got my shipment much fast then I expected. I ordered 2, one was shape square and bulky, but the other was perfect for my hand and use. It became very soft when wet...I would use it on a baby. The reason I didn't give it 5stars is it does not lather up. It just get a little soapy. I use more body wash now. Maybe, it is my water. Any suggestions. I will buy it again."
2,Promising Title Proves Shaky on the Facts,"I ordered this book thankful that something was being written about Queen Victoria's daughters. However, from the moment I began reading this book, I found myself doubting the legitimacy of a lot of the author's findings. Perhaps because of my training as a historian I was disappointed in the end notes--what should have been extensive notes about where the author was getting these excerpts from letters, other facts, etc., was not there. Like other reviewers, I found the author to contradict himself frequently. It was a fun read for the summer, but has no real historical merit."
5,Great book - reading to my pregnant wife's belly,Very cute and adorable book. Can't emphasize enough the fact that God did give us and bless us with our baby girl.
5,Really Like!,Had a little spot on the book's cover that was wipeable with a baby wipe-as I could tell & I was right. It came right out. Good condition is what I ordered and the condition was good. Good purchase.
5,My FAVORITE book for baby so far!,"I absolutely love this book! I cried the first time I read it and still do! What a gift from God, indeed, a child is and it is refreshing to talk about God's role in our childrens' lives. I have looked at and purchased many books in preparation for my little one, and this one BY FAR impressed me most. I highly recommend this book if you want to talk about God and you sheer joy for your baby!"
1,Disappointed,"The story does not just talk about the child being a gift from God, it goes in to detail about the mom being pregnant. Our daughter was adopted and not appropriate for our situation."
3,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I bought this album with my eyes closed (without listening to a single track, a big mistake) after falling in love with the group's first album ""Lost souls"". Guess I was expecting too much. The second album is nowhere close to the debute one! Such a disappointment! It lacks the ""soul"", it has no striking and memorable tunes at all, very monotonous and leaves the impression that the band was just in a rush rush to put out a new recording... Lost Souls was a milestone, this album is a step down. Having said that, I would not rule out the band's capabilities. They have a potential to write much better music. Perhaps album number three will be better?.."
2,Monotonous,"I have tried to listen to this CD and develop something close to the enthusiasm for it shown by so many reviewers here. There are moments on it that interested me, but for the most part I find it monotonous and tedious. As much as I wanted to love it, I just can't. Maybe I should try listening to it again.... Then maybe it is just not to my taste."
2,"DULL, TIRED & A CHORE TO READ","Before this novel, the Necroscope books were billed as a trilogy, well, Brian Lumley should have stuck with that plan. BL goes to the well again with book four.This time, Harry Keogh has lost his ability to use the Mobius continuum. Faethor Ferenczy's other son, Janos has arisen to give Harry grief. It's the same Wamphyri story all over again. It even reads as though Lumley is tired of the formula.With so much going for the series, its difficult to understand why BL doesn't break new ground with Keogh and the E-Branch. There are so many directions he could go that have nothing to do with vampires. With everything Ferenczy, the series has become too incestuous to continue reading.Can't recommend this one. This is the low point in the series."
2,Waste of time and money,My expectations were dashed when I watched this video. The couple spends an eternity describing simple moves in English AND Spanish. It wastes precious time going over the same moves repeatedly. I would recommend Josie Neglia's videos; they have a bigger bang for the buck.
5,WHIZ KIDS,"""Toddlers love watching toddlers! The video keeps my child occupied with this positive, happy, well done show. It isn't overstimulating, which some shows seem to be, it isn't necessary, my little one watches it over and over. While I carefully pick what TV programs or videos for my children, this is one show that makes me feel it is doing good for my little girl."" (A busy Mother in the Midwest)"
2,Not for Professional at all,"I do not expect it perfect tool at [money]. The reason I bought is for only rough estimate quickly. It has to aim straight 90 degrees against flat objects to get correct distance. It is not easy to hold like that with a free hand. I have owned another kind of brand for many years that does not have laser targeting. I paid [money] at [my local home-improvement store], but I have never used it at job site because of too many mistakes. I thought after many years they had changed a lot in technology. There is no difference at all between now and many years ago. Only I paid more for I could not use. It looks excellent for vacant places at this price. I had a chance to use high tech distance measuring tool from Hilti. That is very easy to use and accurate. But expensive."
3,Good....or just Fun?,"All I have to say about this album is that I've had it for years and I probably don't know half of the songs on it. It get's sort of boring and you can't listen to it all the way through. All in all there is some great stuff on here but there is also a lot of crap on this album. They should have only put 20 songs on this thing and cut out all of the rest. Sure some of the stuff on here is catchy but the best part is the snotty vocals and the lyrics are pure genius.Don't pick this album up if you want something good, pick this album up if you want something fun."
5,BEYOND GREAT!,"I was always a huge NOFX fan but never bought any cd's. I was kinda worried to because some people told me that the one's I'd pick out weren't any good at all. So I found this, My friend said that he actually prefers the songs off of this than any others. I listened to to the two discs album and loved every minute of it. In my personal opinion, ""pimps and hookers"" is one of the greatest songs off of the cd! so is ""drugs are good"" and many many many of the really short songs too. I love this cd and it has encouraged me to go out and get more NOFX cd's even if others say that they arn't any good!"
1,"The Messerschmitt Me 262: The World's First Turbojet Fighter (Schiffer Military History, Vol 64)","Don't waste your money. I've found most of the Schiffer Publishing books of this type far inferior in quality when compared to the Squadron/Signal publications. Just a loose compilation of old photo's with not much information. There are web pages that offer more info than the Schiffer series. If you want good reference books with excellent photography then go with the Squaron/Signal ""Walk Around"" and ""In Action"" series."
2,Don't bother,"Well I was excited by the cover of this book, I like books about ships and sailing but when I read this book I was very disappointed. I thought the characters were weak and not developed enough. The hero is a mean man who doens't really get nicer as the story progresses. The heroine was just too good, maybe saintly is a better term. She has come to take care of her dying sister and her child who is the hero's dead brother's family. The story just never seemed to get my attention."
5,It's Awesome!,"The optics are superb, it's actually slightly brighter then the human eye, at least to me... I would recommend this to anybody... One thing that is bad about it is holding the lil' bugger, you have to hold it in a strange fashion, that makes you look weird :-)"
5,The Amber Chronicles,"This is the second book of the Amber Chronicles (the first one is Nine Princes in Amber). Get ready to read eight more (Sign of Unicorn, Hand of Oberon, Courts of Chaos, Trumps of Doom, Blood of Amber, Sign of Chaos, Knights of Shadows, Prince of Chaos) - you will not be able to stop!"
4,Bell 2100 Floor pump,"Pump is efficient, light weight, and economical.Gauge is positioned in a good spot.Fittings are nested well in a pump compartment.Excellent buy for the money."
4,Does the job quickly!,"The Bell Airstrike is a floor pump with a 21"" barrel that really puts out air. It has reasonably sized extensions at the bottom to set your foot on and a comfortable hand grip. The pump action is smooth. It took me about 15 pumps to inflate a mountain bike tire from 40 to 70 pounds, which seems reasonable to me. The top mounted air gauge is fairly easy to read and has a moveable marker to show your target inflation level. Construction seems solid. I use it on ""regular"" (bike or auto tire) style valves. The product guide that comes with the pump does indicate that it will inflate Presta type gauges, but as you can see other reviewers have had trouble with this.Four stars for solid construction and ease of use. Small markdowns for somewhat hard to read gauge and plastic construction of foot rest."
1,Complete waste of $$$$,"I could probably have filled my tire better if I personally tried to blow it up with my mouth. The first one I recieved didn't work. Amazon exchanged it for another, that one worked once. I recently tried to use it again, and it didn't work at all. Don't waste the $20-not worth it. I would give it 0 stars if that option was available."
2,"Pieces missing, isn't this thing new?","Ours arrived with part of the handle, the sports ball inflator, the presta adaptor, and any instructions missing. We're in process with Amazon to get it fixed. But where was the original packaging? What about a warranty or manufacturer contact info? It just came in a big Amazon box with a lot of cushioning. Odd, for an un-used product. Ours may also be leaking out the top. But it did inflate my old Huffy's tires, so on that note I'm happy."
1,Description of product is a lie,Worst purchase ever...don't believe the description of the pump having a presta/schrader head. I got this product in the mail and tried to find the presta head and found that there was just an adapter for presta/schrader valves hidden in the handle. For the life of me I could not get the adapter and the pump to attach with a tight seal on my presta valve tire. It is made out of cheap plastic and probably will never work with a presta valve.
1,Would like to rate it but can't,I would love to rate this product but unfortunatly i have not received this product yet.The order has taken over a month and still no angle finder. I cannot see using a resource such as this if you are unable to receive the product. The estimatedtime says 2-3 days but good luck.BewareAn upset buisness owner.
1,All Spare Tools Gives no Delivery Status,I have been waiting fort this tool for two weeks and Amazon told me today is still has not shipped. Amazon and All Spare Tools both are terrible when it comes to customer service. Find this somewhere else.
5,Angle of the Dangle,"Tired of missing the complementing angle to a piece of crown molding? Want to make your sliding compound miter saw sing you songs of praise? Want to go from good job, well done to PERFECT fit?Then the Bosch DWM40L Miter Finder Digital Protractor/Angle Finder is the ticket. Not only will it provide you with dead nuts accuracy, it will allow you more time for fit and finish on your trim work project because it will totally eliminate the countless hours of manually calculating the angles as well as STOP all trial cuts! Bottom line: One measurement, one cut, and your done!This little gem would be a great gift for the woodworker/carpenter who has everything. It will tickle their fancy and have them scratching their head wondering how they ever got by without it."
1,Incomprehensible,"I hate to say this, but I found this book totally incomprehensible. I don't think I am a stupid or shallow person, and I have an utmost respect for Mr. Hammarskjold, but this book just made no sense to me. Some of the phrases leave me completely mystified, others seem to make sense, but I am never sure that what I read in them is what the writer tried to say. These are his personal notes, he wrote them purely for himself. Perhaps they should stay this way."
1,Author possibly misleading readers,"My wife and I live in Apple Valley, CA and she is listening this book on CD in her car (luckily, we borrowed it from a friend).In the book the author describes his time in the Victorville, CA / Apple Valley, CA area of the United States.He goes on to say that he camped\slept under an apple tree in Apple Valley, CA.I find this account very suspect since the town hasn't had any active orchards in over 50 years!The last, small orchard was maintained on the grounds of the Apple Valley Inn, until it closed in 1986."
4,But not about running,"I enjoyed this book and read it in a few days. The author is so unassuming you really fall in love with him and want to see him succeed. But I got it because it was tagged ""running"". As a beginning runner I thought I might learn something about the philosphy of running. I didn't but I did learn something about the philosphy of life."
4,Food for thought,"The more you think about this book the more you like it and see it for what it is. Sometimes you have to do what seems like running to find the real meaning of who you are, put yourself out there and make the most of what and who you have in your life. Like Norma says, or something along the lines of what she says, if you don't get up at a regular time in the morning it gets harder and harder to get up and eventually you don't get up at all. This is exactly what this book is about, letting life go on around you, ending up in a rut and without any enthusiasm to see what is outside of that rut. It often takes life changing events for people to realise they are stuck but thank goodness Smithy does. We mightn't all bike our way through this particular journey but we should all take the journey of sorts, learn to appreciate life again and not let ourselves slip."
2,Disappointing,"I'm always seeking new writers, new voices, moving stories. I loved the idea of this story...the premise. But it didn't measure up in the end. I didn't care about any of the characters, and I was so tired of Smithy I was hoping his sister would be found alive and he'd get out of the book as soon as possible!Opinions are subjective, of course, but there are objective problems with this book. It reads more like a first draft. It has promise, just not this time around."
3,Goodbye Smithy,"I had read about ""The Memory of Running"" in a free local paper. I believe the reviewer mentioned that the main character reminded him of Forest Gump. Who could resist another Forest Gump? So with that in mind, I read the book.This book dragged until about p. 210. At that point I realized I did care about the characters enough to follow through to the end of the book.My basis synopsis for the book is very much along the lines of Homer's Odyssey:Lonely man on a quest meets many characters along the way and comes out a better person for it- ala Forest Gump, seeing that Smithy isn't the smartest person.I think it's worth a read, but I don't think I'll re-read it anytime soon."
2,All hype,"I read all the hype about this book, so I decided to read it.The writing is very choppy without much flow. The book is billed as this cross country trek where this lovable character meets all these interesting people. Not really. The people he meets are just kind of strange. There is also an ongoing story about his schizophrenic sister. Why a lot of popular authors like to portray schizophrenic sisters, I will never know.People that compared this book to The Catcher in The Rye and Forrest Gump are committing blasphemy."
1,"Man, this was so not good","I'm convinced that Stephen King praised this book and did McLarty a favor simply because they are friends and not because King really liked this book.First off, the voice of Smithy, the narrator, is so inarticulate, simple-minded, uninteresting, and boring that it sounds like a child is telling the story, which would be fine except that Smithy is in his forties. There wasn't a sentence longer than 5 words.Second, the storyline of Smithy and Norma is so contrived, manipulated, and predictable that I knew how this book was going to end the moment we met Norma. Why doesn't Smithy say 'I Love You' to Norma?Third, the fact that Smithy, who is not crazy, has constant delusions of seeing his dead sister is preposterous.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time reading this. You will be disappointed."
2,What is the deal with the breasts?,"I thought this was a cute lighthearted book. I came across it on vacation and read it on the beach. Perfect fair for the surroundings. But I noticed that every time, EVERYTIME, he described a woman character, he described her boobs. It became distracting, and then just plain annoying."
2,not sure what this means,The item broke within a week of having it. My son now has it all taped up with Duct tape but it's just not the same.:(
4,Cool automotive 'artifact',"I got this at a book swap for $2. Being a car enthusiast I thought it was quite an interesting book, and piece of history. It doesn't have much detail on the models but it gives you original cost and a few other interesting facts."
2,Disappointing,"I have PCOS, and was very excited to see that a book was finally published on the subject. While this book may be a good introduction for someone who has just been diagnosed, I felt that it was not useful for me personally. It basically tells you to lose weight, reduce stress, exercise, as well as try new-agey things like acupuncture, aromatherapy, herbal remedies, etc. I was hoping for a more traditional medical take on PCOS, which I felt was lacking. I have most of the symptoms of PCOS including obesity, acne, loss of hair, excess ""male pattern"" hair growth, high insulin, no periods, infertility, and mood swings. Taking some St. John's Wort, eating organic foods, drinking filtered water, and smelling a pretty candle (all things the author suggests) isn't going to address the severity of my problem. If your PCOS isn't severe, and if you are into homeopathic remedies, this book might be helpful to you. It was not helpful to me."
1,Disgusted,"Lisa Beamer disgusts me. She reminds me of the shallow, self-serving, sheltered, suburban women in the church I grew up in. It is so obvious that she has used the tragedy of her husband's death to gain fame for herself. It took everything in me to finish the remaining chapters after the plane crash when she is describing all of her public appearances and using Christianity as an excuse to put herself in the spotlight. Lisa Beamer was just an average person who happened to lose her husband in a very sad, but extraordinary way. Like some of the other people who have mentioned this, I too would like to know why Todd Beamer's face is not on the cover."
5,Inspirational,"I have read this book three times already. Lisa Beamer is just one of thousands of people who, on September 11, 2001, lost a loved one and had her world turned upside down. I am so grateful that she shared her story.It is inspirational to me how strong her faith is. Through her trial, she chose to cling to God. And He provided for her, as He does for those who trust and obey Him.After reading several negative reviews of this book, I think it's obvious that those who hate God cannot understand or appreciate the Beamers' faith. Regretfully, maybe this isn't a book for you.But if you love the Lord, do read Lisa's story because she and Todd are examples of those who live this life for Him, even through trials and triumph."
5,Can't Put It Down,One of the best-written books I've read in a long time. Fascinating stories and great insights into Lisa and Todd's lives and the events surrounding 9-11. When you put yourself in her shoes you can see how you can really make a difference with your life. I can see why this book is a bestseller.
2,roll over,"Anytime tragedy surrounds a country, any written material that delves on that tragedy is always touching. ""Let's Roll"" gives us a peek into what may have happened during Flight 93. But after all that is said and done, what truly happened on that flight remains a speculation. True, this book gives us a glimpse of the person Todd Beamer was (and his life with Lisa), but in the end, the book does not offer much other than what was already reported by the media. The whole book could have easily been condensed into a 5-page magazine article. How much could you write about an incident that lasted 10 minutes? And though others may gush over this book, I suppose the timing of its release (a few days before the first anniversary of Sept. 11) contributed more to people's emotion than did the actual text."
5,"testament to faith, hope, and love...","An incredible, deeply moving testament to faith, hope. and love in the face of blind hatred and unrepentent evil."
2,Too much of a religious tract,"Undoubtedly, Todd Beamer deserves all of the accolades for being such a hero on the 9-11 flight that was forced down in Pennsylvania. And, our hearts go out to Lisa Beamer and his family who did nothing to deserve such a horror at the hands of the terroists.That said, this book is a disppointment. The coverage of the horrible events themselves and the follow up activites of Ms. Beamer are quite informative and make for good reading. However, the first 160 pages, or so, going over the lives and experiences of the Beamers prior to 9-11 are kind of like filler so the book will have enough pages. But, the alienating thing for me was Ms. Beamer's turning the book into too much of a Christian tract. I wouldhave enjoyed the book more if she had refrained from so much ""witnessing"" and stayed with the story."
5,An Amazing Testimony,"This book was more than I thought it would be. Lisa's understanding of the truth of the Gospel is very clear in these pages. It is an awesome testimony to the hope that we have in Jesus Christ.I cried as she recounted the moments after learning of the plane crash, as she explained to her son that Daddy wasn't coming home and as she arrived at the hospital to give birth to her daughter. Yet through each event, she leaned on the One who can give us comfort and hope. This book is a must read for anyone who is struggling through any type of suffering, not just mourning a death.I am more impressed with her now than I had been before. God has truly used her as a messenger for His truth."
1,Returned same day received,Just awful -- I use a tea press and coffee press both by Bodum and I love them. This doesn't work for loose leaf tea or coffee -- doesn't trap them -- would not use it if someone gave it too me :(I can imagine how anyone got this to work to their satisfaction ---
3,its ok,"Chinsey but will do the job.Going to use it on a cruise, cause cruise coffee stinks.bringing my own cream too.daboss"
3,Not worth the money,"The only problem I have with this cup is the rubber gasket used to keep the grains down. It's not stiff enough, if it were the metal screen type this would defiantly be a 5star rating. The insulation works great and keeps my coffee warm. Really not worth $30 though."
2,a few design flaws,"Im an avid loose tea drinker and occasionally will have coffee so I figured this would be perfect as a travelling mug, for the most part it is nice, but its insullating properties seem to be kinda poor, in a 15 minute drive to work my drink becomes cool, ive had other travel mugs that kept my beverage hot for at least an hour. Another thing i dont like is how the plunger doesnt go down all the way, i would have like the plunger to be made in such a manner that it compresses the leaves or grinds to the bottom and not have them just trapped but able to ""swim"" freely. the filter is fine, if you push it slowly and evenly it does a good job of not letting anything get by."
3,Requires Course Ground Coffee,"Bought this and used ""drip coffee"" grind which was not caught in the screen. Otherwise works fine."
3,I wouldn't likely buy it again.,"I love this thing. The only problem I have is that I like red tea and it tends to have very small pieces which make it past the press. (the reason for 4 stars)After having this mug for a while, I am taking away another star. I just plain don't use it anymore because it is more hassle than it is worth. If I drank tea with larger leaves, it might be ok, but red tea and coffee really don't work worth a darn because the leaves and grinds constantly make it past the filter and into my mouth. Also, I like a little milk and sugar in a lot of my tea and coffee and that is difficult to accomplish with this mug."
2,I WANTED to like this book.,"Written as a first-person narration, this double monologue sets up the narrator's fall-from-grace prattling at his therapist in opposition to his narration of a tour of Jack the Ripper's London. If you think this allegorical juxtaposition has potential, then you MIGHT like the book. I suspended my feeling that the juxtaposition wouldn't work, but then I just got tired of the narrator's self-obsessed whining."
3,Interesting history - dry writing,"Obviously afte reading Rise to Rebellion I had to finish the story - but I suspect the writer felt much the same way.The history is retold, the facts are interesting, but there is little flair in the recounting of the historical events and not much to draw in the reader or even to elicit attachment to the characters.Although it is a worthy read it was not the engaging experience I hoped for."
5,A Very Fun Novel - And Lots of Fun!,"This is the first Richard Russo novel I've read, and what a treat it is. This is the funniest novel I've ever read, a story about how we fit into our family and our own life, and can we live up to our ""promise"". A finely written novel."
3,Mediocre,"I was expecting something more of wit from this book. It's cotton candy for the reader- not filling, but sweet. Straight Man just seems to be another fairly mediocre book of the grocery store book aisle type. Granted, it has its funny points, but they aren't the belly-aching laughter producing kind promised by so many reviewers of this book. It's a fun and easy read if that's all you are going for, however."
3,Slow going at first,I've had a difficult time getting into this. I am not sure yet what the point is. I keep waiting for conflict of some sort and it hasn't happened yet. Maybe it is too subtle for me. I am about 1/3rd through.
4,What a fun novel!!!,"This is the first novel I've read by Richard Russo, but it definitely won't be the last. He is an extremely talented writer. The fact that he is also tremendously funny is just an added bonus. This book was just entertaining from beginning to end. The characters were real and endearing. The relationships, both heartbreaking and frustrating. ""Lucky Hank"" is a complicated man with a lot of issues to deal with: staffing shake-ups, extramarital-temptations, budget woes, health scares... Not unlike a large percentage of the population. Russo is able to tackled them all beautifully and humorously...Definitely a reader to follow!"
4,Disappointing compared with Risk Pool and Mohawk,"If you loved Risk Pool and Mohawk, you'll probably be disappointed with Straight Man. Well written in first person but slow going. Amusing but not hilarious. We can only hope he's got this genre out of his system and returns to his earlier form"
2,Is comedy supposed to be this run-of-the-mill?,"Bought this novel after recommendation upon recommendation. A part of academe myself (English Department, no less) I was looking forward to this. However, I found the humor safe and predictable; I found the characters a little too surface. I really didn't care about any of them, they were all too humdrum.I did, however, think the very ending was excellent."
5,Amin Love w/Mr. Russo!!,Mr. Russo!You have RUINED ME!!In a 'good way'!Have TOTALLY fallen in love withyour storires & how you use ourlanguage!WHAT will I do without you?Please keep writing!Also...who are your favorite authors?
5,"Seriously, this book is funny!","For all those people interested in academia, this book is a soothing must. The plot is very creative, and the situations that Russo creates are extremely funny. Once you start the first few pages, you cannot stop until the last page. I rigoroysly recommend this book to anyone with an open-minded sense of humor (and an empathetic itch for academics...)"
4,Great Salsa/Pop Fusion CD,"The fusion of well known pop artists (ie; U2, Coldplay, etc.) and Buena Vista Social Club totally works on this great CD."
4,I had no idea Hendrix did an album of Muzak.,"There is no doubt that the guitar playing on this album smokes. Larry Carlton can string together legato lines with great hooks at blinding speed. I hate smooth jazz - like Kenny G et al. It is just another way of saying Muzak. There is plenty of that here, but, in my opinion the mind shredding guitar more than makes up for it. For some it might not. I would love to hear this guy jam with 1975 era Jeff Beck. That would have been quite a combination."

2,installation nightmare,"This is a review solely based on the experience of installing the part. I bought this unit after reading the good reviews of it. But then it took me hours to install it. To install the heatsink, you need to uninstall&reinstall your motherboard (unplug&plug your video card, sound card...). It took me 3 hours to do so, only to find that it is not working. To correct the installation would cost me another 3 hours, so I simply returned the item. It may be a good heatsink for a new system building, but not for others. May be not even for a new system building, because everytime you replace the heatsink, you have to uninstall&reinstall the motherboard. I would rather take a ZALMAN 9500A 92mm or ZALMAN CNPS9700 for socket 775."
4,Only 4 stars cuz it's not expensive.,"This hsf heatsink w/ fan has lots of good reviews, and installs sure-as-a-rock. It's lightweight and keeps my E6320 intel cpu at 39-41C and is a good bang for the buck. For a lower priced hsf, it's really an ok one. I'm gonna keep & use mine."
1,Not For Beginners,"If you are an average homeowner looking for a book so you can build a patio or a foundation for a large outside shop/building, this book is not for you. There is not enough specific detail. I agree, SAVE YOUR MONEY and LOOK ELSWHERE!"
3,The Zero Game,"Exciting political thriller!I really liked these book,it's fast paced and the author Brad Meltzer seems to know the intrigues of the Capitol!Meltzer keeps you guessing all the time and gives enough clues but you are never sure if you are right or wrong!The only thing that is not belivable it's the relationship in beetween Harris and the spunky 16 years old Viv.He is a experienced senator's staffer and she is just a kid,she is a page that leads him around by the nose!She is more mature than he is!The plot has enough power to hurry you through the book until the end,and the end explains everything about all the charaters!I guess the author really wanted to make sure you get the same conclusion he imagined ! Anyways I still enjoyed these book very much. Everything was just a game,a killer game !"
3,Not sure if I can finish reading it,"Some people might complain about me writing this review after having only read one and a half chapters of this book. I bought the book because of the reviews, but I find so far (1.5 chapters in) there is way too much description and not much happening. The author has been commended for the research he did, but if that means that every page has endless descriptions then I don't think I'll be able to read much further. Any comments on this?"
1,HORRIBLE,Absolutely one of the most boring books of the year. 460 pages of pure crap - a watse of anyone's time.
3,Roller Coaster,"I started reading this book and I was hooked. Then about the middle it got a bit stale, but definately picked up in the end. I recommend it as a good beach book and it's a fun read if you are from DC or know DC well. I won't read another of his books, but it was entertaining."
2,Broke Rules,"I won't spoil what Brad Meltzer does in this book, but holy cow, you don't break the kind of rules he does, in this really not so good book. I will give him credit for a easy to read writing style and he has a great imagination, but wow, read this and you'll be shaking your head like I was."
4,a real grabber,"This book by Meltzer was a real grabber. Right from the first page you are grabbed by the scruff of the neck and pulled through the book. He knows how to make characters live and you want to live with them. Enjoyed the book so much. Glad he has written others so now I can find them too.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the'Isms'"""
1,Terrible Book,Zero Game actually starts off pretty good. A very interesting idea for a political game being played by politicians. But after about 50 pages it gets terrible. I can honestly say this is the worst book I have ever read. Page after page of nothing. Note to author - books are so much more enjoyable when you make an attempt to get and/or keep the interest of the reader.
1,Not worth finishing,"Don't recall putting down a book after reading half before, but this one I did. The role and dialogue of a 17 year old was absurd. The whole book was so far fetched it simply wasn't enjoyable. The plot had potential for a good book but Martini let his imagination get the better of him. Needs to look at how many sentences end with ""said"". If it was better written we would have known who said what more often.My first Martini book. My last Martini book."
2,good premise...then boring,"Because I hated ""The Tenth Justice"" so much, I swore I would never read another Meltzer book again. Whoops, I bought it because the blurb seemed intriguing. My mistake. I see it's on the best-seller list...I guess a lot of us made a mistake. I liked the initial premise...a betting game played by Washingtonparticipants. Noone knows who the other players are. But as the game progresses, it just seems a hook to draw us into an ""I-don't-care-about-this-mine"" plot. OK, learned my lesson...no more Meltzer ever!"
3,Not very sturdy,"We purchased a case, and several of them had cracked plastic at the binding seams. Thought they would be in better condition, but it's not frugal to ship back and get replacements. The price was fair."
4,Great so far!,Makes my office chair bearable! I have owned this product for 2 years now and it is holding up well. The foam is still dense. I would buy it again.
3,Product useful but not a 'pretty' smell,I am not expecting the lethal force of a chemical based product but it does do the job well enough. The scent however leaves a lot to be desired and I find I have to cut in stronger pleasant smelling shampoo or follow up with a scented conditioner to cut the unpleasant smell of this product.
4,I sure do like it,"This is, for me at least, along with Elite Hotel, not quite as excellent as the other albums Ms. Harris produced between Pieces of the Sky and Roses in the Snow. Be that as it may, it is still VERY GOOD. The six albums Emmylou recorded during the second half of the ninth decade of the twentieth century are all, in a way, masterpieces of a singular country music vision. To say that I rank Blue Kentucky Girl and Elite Hotel slightly below the other four is to still say that they are VERY GOOD. Perhaps my own personal prejudices come into play here. I'll try to ignore my prejudices: if you like ANY Emmylou Harris recording, then you'll very likely love Blue Kentucky Girl."
2,Not her best,"Not worth buying the whole album, though I love her (and bought it),. For this period, get the Collected Bests (there have been several versions over the years."
5,"Honest, educating and very entertaining.",As an admirer of Greta Van Sustern I was pleased when I received her book. It is a thoroughly enjoying read. Her intelligence and wit shines through.It tells you a lot about her world and background. Even though it is very educational it is by no means stuffy or boring.As a matter of fact it's hard to put down.Makes you eager for her sequel.
3,A good read,Greta has come up with a nice little book here. Nothing too controversial for the meek reader; however i think this is also the down side of the book.
2,"A different, strange experience","Personally I rarely use this deck as it lacks scenery in the minor and the major contains so much different symbols I myself cannot feel a strong connection with. This is an art deck for me.When I use it for reading, maybe because of the different images, which reminded me with a exotic feeling I am not familiar with, I feel very strange indeed. The reading often gives a very exotic, distance feeling to me.I like tarot deck with black borders. They give me a focused concentration on the pictures, and I often notice things I havnt notice before during readings. And the atmosphere will be more serious. Osho Zen and Russian Tarot of St Petersburg are all good. This is the main reason I bought this deck.I guess I am not suitable to use this deck. I wish I could have bought the book. It would certainly help me to transfer to this totally different system. It would help a lot. This is not a bad tarot deck, I just cannot really connect to it."
4,Pretty good,"I liked Shelley Holmes way more than I liked the supposed main character, Arielle. I think it was because Shannon spent more time developing the Shelley character then she did the Arielle character. I've only read one other book by Shannon (Themaine? I believe was in the title) and that one spent much more time developing the character into a well rounded person that fought between turning evil. In this book, Arielle is petty and childish. I can't for the life of me see why two men would fight over her, much less compliment her on her strength. Another thing concerning Shelley was that Shannon gets the reader all excited only to dump us in the end. It is obvious she is leading us into the next book. Which I plan to read."
3,Interesting but dry to read,"Jenson's two-volume systematic theology is intellectually very interesting. The only problem is that the book is also very dry and academic in its language, making his great work difficult to read and follow. An academic book doesn't have to be poorly written. I would give his splendid opus five stars, but all the pain and suffering reading the book reduce the stars to three."
2,Still awaiting the earthquakes,"This book predicted earthquakes on the eastern and western coasts, and the south, and northwestern portions of the US in 1988. Of course, it could still happen...I have trouble grabbing the big picture and wrapping my mind around the notion we ""choose to return to our physical manifestations"". I see handicapped, neglected, homeless people and I wonder if an entity actually chose this?I recently listened to a recording of one of the Abraham channelings. It was interesting. What exactly does Jerry Hicks do?"
5,Practical guide to manifestation principles and techniques.,"I highly recommend this book from the channeled group of beings who call themselves ""ABRAHAM"". It gives specific techniques for focusing your life energy practical and often humorous ways. I was able to use the principle and technique called ""segmenting"" immediately. It's worth the price of the book to read their explanation on how we draw things to us with one thought and push things away with another! Worth reading over and over!"
5,Excellent Pocket Guide,"We found this book to be an excellent, small pocket guide; easy to throw in your bag for while you're out picking for jars at festivals, antique stores, etc.The diagrams of the markings are clear and easy to interpret...the only thing that would make this book better would be if it had color photographs as examples, but...it is what it is and it's great for it!"
4,Canning Jars,"This was exactly what I was looking for. I have begun to gather canning jars for my retirement and move to our farm. I plan to can a lot of my garden produce as well as fruits, jellies and juices. As I packed my jars in boxes, I noticed that they were not all the same and that some of the names I did not recognize. I love this book as it portrays all of the various enscriptions on the front of canning jars as well as gives approximate value. I have identified several that I have bought and have been surprised at where they have come from. This has made gathering my jars for the future more of an adventure."
2,Good but not great,"I bought this book thinking it would help me gain a lot of knowledge about the many jars I've accumulated, but it was not what I expected. There is very little information about jars, specifically, and the pricing doesn't seem to be up to date. I immediately ordered the ""Red Book,"" which, even though it was a lot more expensive, was much more useful to me.This is a good little reference book if you just want to know where that symbol on the bottom of your jar came from. Also, I was surprised that this was such a small ""book""-it really is a booklet (it is stapled in the middle) and should be advertised as such."
5,Essential,"Although not as consistently wonderful as ""Rumours"", it is, nonetheless, an essential recording to have by this band."
3,Far Too Much,"Had Fleetwood Mac edited this overly long follow-up to the classic ""Rumors"" album down from a double to a a single, they might have had another classic on their hands. As it is, there is far too much filler and not enough first rate material here. They may have been trying to avoid repeating themselves, but they succeeded by producing an inferior album."
5,"can you say: ""creative peak""?","_tusk_ is fleetwood mac's _white album_, and that pretty much says it all. this was lindsey buckingham's project, and his tendency for weirdness is exactly what this band needed. interestingly, the album follows a kind of alternating weird-song-easy-song format that somehow makes the easy songs weird and the weird songs even weirder. great piece of work, here. criminally overlooked."
5,who could not like tusk?,"If it wasn't for Tusk coming after Rumours Tusk could've been the greatest rock 'n' roll album ever. Christine was defeintly going through a blues phase through this album which is definetly shwon throuogh ""Over and Over"" and ""Brown Eyes"" yet still created great rock and pop songs like ""Think About Me"" and ""Never Forget"". Buckingham songs were rockish with a small hint of pop. These two types of music created quite a bit of contrast which is just one fragment of the things that make this album great. Stevie song writting skills have grown greatly and are shown greatlly in Tusk. Espicaly in ""Sisters Of The Moon"" and ""Sara"". Mick's drum skills are getting more exeleent each album and the some goes for John. My advice dont listen to people who people who say that Tusk is not good. BUY TUSK NOW!!!"
4,Worth It For Christine McVie,"Other reviewers have said it better than I could about the personal nature of this recording. This was the band left alone to get creative and bold. And they did. A number of outstanding songs are contained on Tusk, including the title track, Angel, Sara, Walk A Thin Line, among others.But the best cuts are Over and Over, Brown Eyes, and Honey Hi. These three gentle moody songs possess some of the most beautiful vocal arrangements I have ever heard. Harmonically haunting and perfectly recorded. Christine McVie's angelic voice blends magically with Buckingham's and Nicks'.If only for these three gems, Tusk is worth it."
5,Very Good,"This album rivals Rumours, in my opinion. Not sure why it didn't do so well, though. The gems are: Sara, Angel, Sisters of the Moon, Brown Eyes, Honey Hi, Walk A Thin Line, Tusk, and Beautiful Child. Every Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie song is wonderful on here -- Lindsey not so much, but he was in his ""experimental"" phase, I suppose."
1,Rhetorical Question,"This book is poorly written: it is unbalanced in its coverage of content, it is so skeletal in style that it is hard to read, most of the anecdotal ""context"" consists of the usual suspects without any value added. I'm stupefied that a man who has studied elocution, argument, and rhetoric as a whole for his entire professional life, could write such a flat, disjointed, largely mediocre book. Who would possibly consider this to be a passable introduction to the art of oratory?"
2,CINEDRAMATIC LAWN BOWLING COMEDY,"I watched this movie with my girlfriend during what I was trying to call our 'National Lampoon' phase, which was really only my 'Discovering that National Lampoon is a Salable License that Has no Connection to Pre-Existing National Lampoon Films or Media'....Whether or not you can enjoy this film depends on whether or not (1) you have seen Dodgeball and whether or not (2) you think that the premise of lawn bowling being treated as a dramatic subject is funny after having seen Dodgeball....Vince Vaughn's comic charisma almost saves the movie, but he doesn't show up until you're already a half hour in and asking your girlfriend if you shouldn't trade it for National Lampoon's Dorm Daze."
1,"Terrible, Junk!","This movie has been out for awhile. The only thing new is National Lampoons Logo. The plot was trying to make fun of dodgeball, but in the end the laughter was really Weak. Watch dodgeball instead!"
5,Al Jarreau All Fly home,"The CD arrived in perfect condition, and plays perfectly. I saw Al in person at ASU in the 70's and this really brought back memories. Kitty"
1,So Disappointed...,"This is without a doubt the most awful Grisham has ever written. Not only is it sloppy and poorly executed, it is immoral in its treatment of people of objects and an unborn that is merely an inconvenience that cost $300 to dispose of."
1,Grisham at his worst,"This is the worst book (Grisham or not) I have ever read. It has no conflict, no plot, no twist, nothing. Save your time."
2,LAME,This was an OK short story but definitely not worth the price of a hardback book. If you see it laying as a free used book on a bookshelf - go ahead and read it - but don't pay for it (unless it's cheap). Maybe men might enjoy this more - the big jock failing as an adult and missing the glory days - I don't know.
4,Good book but a a bit on the short side.,This is the first Grisham book that I have read. I was very satisfied with it overall. Despite being a quick read (less than 200 pages ) it has characters that are detailed very well and a great main plot. The only blemish is that it might have been too quick of a read. With it being written so well I really couldnt out it down and finished it in less than 3 days. I would reccomend this book to aanyone who has ever played organized football at a high school level or higher.
2,WHEN WILL COURT BE IN SESSION AGAIN?,"Frankly Bleachers left flat, tired and uninterested, kind of like watching a high school football game where the opponent is trouncing your team and the only sensation left is the hardness of the bleachers.I wonder what Grisham is up to? Where are the legal dramas that made him a keeper and a best seller? I can only hope that court will be in session again soon and that Grisham will leave these non-legal dramas to other authors more fitted to the genre.Douglas McAllister"
2,Not His Best Work,I am a women & I like football. I even played women's football in school. However I think the book spent too much time on how the game was played instead of on the characters themself. The worst part of it was the big boom that I was waiting for to explain why he got upset was wasted on me. I was waiting for something more ump then what happened. It just did not do it for me this time.I love John Grishms books but lately.....
3,Going back,Grisham takes on an interesting concept. The concept of going home after a longhiatus. It is difficult. It changes your perspectiveon how you viewed thing previously and how you willview things in the future. I can't argue with the experiencesas related in the book because I have never done it.Good story.
2,plotless,A disappointment. I kept on reading waiting for a plot that never appeared. The characters are well drawn but they don't do anything. Grisham has written many great novels. Skip this one.
2,Good concept bad execution,"Generall I love Grisham's work.But this book seemed 'rushed' to get it out i guess is the only way to put it.Way too much 'game' fillers, and you could tell the ending by the first 40 pages.The revalation, was not that thrilling, expected but not the way it happened.A football buff would enjoy this book than just the average reader, and they would only enjoy it because of the 'game' fillers."
4,A Must Read For Former Football Players,"Grisham departs away from his normal lawyer dramas and this is what makes this book so refreshing. Having been a former football player myself, this book deeply hit those old memories. Walking upon the gridiron that we labored on since we were barely able to pull our shoulder pads on. This book's plot is pretty much figured a quarter way through, yet Grisham still compels the reader to continue along. Overall anyone who enjoys the sport of American football will enjoy this book, anyone else won't understand the importance of the way football brings together boys and makes them into men, forming a long lasting brotherhood."
4,Good one!,"I really enjoyed this book and it brought back the ""Glory Days"" of my youth. Good message and easy to read. I like that John Grisham has branched out to other genres."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"Grisham's short novel about high school football in a small texas town was a disappointment. I generally enjoy Grisham's digressions from the legal arena, but this story was under-developed and not up to his usual level of writing."
2,Too long for me,"I thought Bleachers was a law book based on the cover. ???Boy was I wrong. I couldn't have been farther from the truth. What a bunch of false advertising. Plus, I thought it was a bit lengthy at 176 pages. I mean, c'mon, If I wanted to read for weeks, I'd pick up an encyclopedia - catch my drift???!!I thought it was boring until I found out he got his knew blown out by a cheap shot when playing the sport of football. Serves him right. And, oh, am I supposed to feel sorry for the dead coach or the losers who continue to live out their high school glory and can't move on??? Well, Joseph O'Brien doesn't. No sir."
4,Long time Grisham Fan,Grisham returns to producing riveting novels with this book. It wasn't a suspense driven thriller like his early novel but he establishes excellent characters that drive the entire story. A must read for any Grisham fan.
2,Not what you expect.,"I have read every novel written by this Author. I could easily believe that someone else wrote this boring book and he put his name on it for the money. What the heck was he thinking when he wrote this disappointing drivel without a plot. If you're a die-hard Grisham fan, your expectations will die-easily while reading this book. He should stick with the formula he knows, the law.I made the mistake of paying full price for this book.Check out the reviews of these books; The Da Vinci Code, Mind Catcher, Alien Rapture, and Timeline. I greatly enjoyed these books, unlike Bleachers (Bleakers)."
5,John Grisham at his best,"No murder, no lawyers, no court scenes but this is Grisham at his best. A moving story of a great coach and the affect he had on a boy, a team, and a town. I recommend this to you if you or any family member has, at some time in their lives, had a coach for a mentor."
2,Disappointed,"I wasn't expecting a legal typical Grisham tale, but I thought it would have more substance than I found in this book.The all-american quarterback comes back to the small town along with all the other football players who had all played for the loved and hated coach as he is on his deathbed. Neely Crenshaw was not a lovable character since I really did not think he was well developed.This was a story of the players all reminiscing, but it was supposed to really be a story of self discovery for Crenshaw and show how he was finally able to wrap up that era of his life and move on. But, I felt like this book came up short. It just didn't have any magic or spark.I am a sports fan, not necessarily a football fan and I found the ten or so pages devoted to play-by-play and player commentary on a game to be a complete bore. It did not add anything to the story, in my opinion.Move on and try another football or Grisham book. You can skip this one!"
1,Bleachers,I was very disapointed with this book. It did not come up to Grisham's standards which are usually 4 & 5 stars. It just did not hold my attention.
2,Disappointing,I was a little disappointed in this book. I have read all of his books but this one I just kept wondering when it was going to get better.
4,A great football story,"I am not a great football fan. However, in Bleachers, Grisham gives us the story of Coach Rake who is dying, and it's different and well, very moving.I read recently that John Grisham is to the law what Ken McClure is to the medical world, but there's no sign of lawyers hereIt's a shorter than average Grisham story at 163 pages, but if you're a Grisham fan, go and read it if you haven't already."
3,Not your usual John Grisham,"This is not your usual John Grisham novel. There is a lawyer and a judge, but they are totally insignificant characters that have no effect on the story. Girsham left his law books at home on this one and picked up a football.BLEACHERS is a trip down memory lane. It's onoe of those ""you can't go home again"" melodramas that is full of lost loves, shattered dreams and thought of what could have been.The plot centers on Coach Eddie Rake and the relationship he has with his players. Football is a way of life in this small town and Rake is at its center. The saying that there is a fine line between love and hate permeates this story.This is an extremely quick read, more akin to a short story or novella than a novel. It has its moments, particularly for those who grew up in such a football atmoshpere, but the larger than life coach of the novel really didn't seem so great to me."
3,Interesting Look At High School Sports,Bleachers is an interesting slice of American Life - High School and Football. It is a moving tale of a high school football coach and the experience that happen. I thought the story was very well told and interesting. And the characters were very believable and real. It is a book anyone who has been involved in high school football can relate to.The only negative was that I listened to the Book on Tape.And they had the Author read it. While John Grisham is a wonderful writer - he just doesn't make a good narrator. The Book on Tape would have been alot better if they had used a professional voice-over actor.
2,OK,BLEACHERS By John Grisham was not very good. So short. It talks about 4 days of a man's life. I could write a book just like it. All I would have to do is go to a football game and write down every play. People just go to a book store and read it there it will take 45 min. AIN'T WORTH NO MONEY. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND FINAL VERDICT BY SHELDON SIEGEL!!!
2,A real disappoinment,"Don't waste your money buying this book. The Grisham name conjures up suspense & court rooms battles. Instead we get a boring read of former high school football stars back in town to mourn the loss of their head coach. While there is some insight into the mentality of ""football stars"", it was not worth the price - borrow it from a friend or library."
4,Huge Grisham Fan,"Although this is unlike Mr. Grisham's prior works, I still found this book enjoyable. This book contained sporatic humor and shows the human side to the characters that Grisham is notorious for accentuating in his books."
1,"""Bleachers"" big disappointment !!","Have always loved John Grisham books BUT ""The Bleachers"" was a huge disappointment. It was boring. This is not Grisham at his best. Maybe he should stick to writing about lawyers, etc. Guess I am just used to being engrossed in his books and could not even get interested in this one."
2,Disappointed fan,"I thought this book was disappointing, at best. Have you ever seen the movie ""Varsity Blues""? This book reminded me of this movie - a rather long and blown out version of it with a slightly different ending. If you don't have a overwhelming love for football, this book is a total bore. I have loved each one of his books until this point, so I am hoping he gets back on track and gives us back what we want... or he will lose me as a fan."
1,"if you don't like football, don't bother","This book was so boring I only read the first couple of chapters and then skipped to the end. This story had no real plot and there was just too much about football - however if you like football then maybe you'll find it interesting. Overall, I was disappointed with this book. If you really want to read it, just borrow it from the library. I think John Grisham should stick with the legal thriller genre."
2,Disappointing for Grisham,"Unless you have played football, there is little to enjoy about Bleachers. Grisham's weakest work, it is nothing like his previous great novels. The book is very short, and a quick read, but without much depth. The plot remains undeveloped, the characters barely revealed. Overall a disappointment."
3,Relationalship between players and their coach,"This is a low key, but engaging story that brings back the feelings of high school Friday night football: the lights, the excitement, the cheerleaders, the football heroes, and of course your first love. Coach Eddie Rake had molded the Spartans into an unbeatable football dynasty. However, he was hard, unemotional, and demanded total perfection from his players. But now it is fifteen years later and the players have returned for the funeral of Coach Rake. As they sit in the bleachers waiting for the coach to die, they remember the games, discuss their lives, and try to decide if they hated Eddie Rake or loved him. This story has been told many times and this book may not be the best telling, but it is short and has it own charm. It focuses primarily on the love/hate relationship between players and their coach and does a good job of it. I enjoyed it."
2,"Plenty of page-turuning exposition, a bit thin on characterization","Like most people who have reviewed this book, I picked it up having read a few of Grisham's legal novels and knowing that this author can really spin a good yarn. To his credit you do want to keep turning the pages for this one, and there are plenty of secrets that this book only unlocks towards the end.The biggest let-down for me was the way that you don't get to feel like you know any of the characters. There are plenty of them running through these pages, but they are all so one-dimensional that it's hard to believe any of their motivations. The book develops a of sentimentality that gets really hard to bear towards the end.It only takes about two hours to read, but honestly now that I've read it I wish I had spent those two hours readings something else- even a Grisham legal thriller would have been more rewarding!"
4,Good book for light summer reading,"I like this book. It is not some serious work of ficiton that will be placed on future high school reading lists, but I liked it nonetheless.This is a fast read and is especially good for football fans. This is the type of book you take on a long plane flight and you could finish it on the plane."
5,I understand,"""Bleachers"" gives a wonderfull description of high school football. While in high school I hated my coach but, I respected him. This book helped me understand why he was so hard on us. This is the best book I've ever read."
3,How about a little peasant feeling?,"This is a very ""classical"" interpretation of the mazurkas. Very correct, fluid technique, all's good here. This is my personal taste, I prefer a little more joy and ""dancing"" in my mazurkas."
5,So Far So Good,This thing is holding up great after 2 months - no hiccups. It is powering:1. EVGA 775 Motherboard2.

4,the constructed past: a guide to experimental archaeology,This is a very clearly presented book covering any aspect of modern experimental archaeology that one might expect. An all round good book on all levels of academia. It is only the price that may put you off.
5,You Go George!!!,"Two classic Benson hits ""Love X Love"" and the unforgetabletitle song anchor this seamless album that also includes abeautifully jazzy cover of ""Moody's Mood"" and a stellar versionHeatwave's ""Star Of A Story"".Now Benson also contributes thegrooving instrumental ""Off Broadway"" that producer Quincy Jonessmooths over with that famous R&B/pop sheen he became famous for during this era.From beginning to end a fabulouslyentertaining album that's grooving,jazzy and funky all thesame time.Worth more then your two cents!"
5,Another magnificent performance for Miss Crawford,"Hollywood is no longer churning out excellent professional actresses such as Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Lana Turner, Dhianne Carroll (I may have spelled her name wrong) Dorthy Dandridge, and many others to say the least.I have always loved watching Joan Crawford movies. In Possessed she played the psychotic role of Louise, a woman who is obsessed with a man named David, who plays on her emotions, and then tires of her and treats her like nothing more than a fly on his shoulder. His attitude towards her causes tragic results."
5,Ravishing,"Djamileh is not Carmen, but by the same token Carmen is not Djamileh. Djamileh also is not the Pearl Fishers though it is closer to it. This one-act opera stands on its own, showing in what very different and original ways Bizet could rise to a challange. The story of the slave girl and the variety seeker may have produced a delicious frisson in the breasts of the corsetted 19th century audience, but now it is both politically incorrect and not overly interesting. Nevertheless, Bizet lavishes some splendid music, in many instances quite far in advance of its time, on this work. Lucia Popp sings with a melting sweetness that should win any heart even if you cannot make out most of her words. Franco Bonisolli in the unsympathetic tenor role matches her perfectly. Gardelli makes it all fit together, including the splashes of ""oriental colour"", bringing the best from his orchestra and choir. The booklet contains the libretto."
3,"Not one of Van's best, but","not without some truly transcendant moments that make this well worth owning for any music lover. (Hey, that could describe any lesser Van Morrison album.) ""Kingdom Hall"" is an infectious r&b tinged rocker and the title track is a Morrison classic, but ""Santa Fe/Beautiful Obsession"" is the true standout here--hypnotic and absolutely stunning. Not all of the rest works and the obvious attempts at contemporary hit-making can sound a bit dated, but all in all a fine, if not spectacular album."
2,Slick & Glossy,"The faceless, generic rock production is even more dated than a pair of Mork from Ork striped suspenders. In the late 70s, most white cats wanted a ""Springsteen lite"" sound for greater ""authenticity"". Think Lou Reed's solo albums from this period. But does our Van really need to sound as lame & cheesey as the Eagles or Jackson Browne?"
2,This Is The Worst Official Van Morrison Album I Have In My Collection,"Which is just my way of saying that it is better than INARTICULATE SPEECH OF THE HEART, cuz that's the only one I don't own anymore. Looking for some good Van you might not have heard. I could suggest 187 albums to look at first. But this one doesn't totally suck. I listen to it every leap year!"
5,"a personal testament, for better or worse","Some time ago the popularity of this tome was criticized as being fueled by ""the Oprah factor"" more than genuine literary interest. But after all, poetry is at its most powerful when the reader can identify with the speaker, and it is probably for the better that we possess the knowledge that makes it possible regarding this collection. Hughes may have been cruel towards Plath, but that is not for us to judge. What is indisputable is that Hughes has retched out every word in terrible agony. It is a heartbreaking testament."
3,"Not very good, not verse either","...This is how Ted saw Sylvia's fingers. It's a pity that the same cannot be said about Ted's fingers. The poems in ""Birthday Letters"" have a refreshing smell of honesty about them. However, it's difficult to believe that these pieces were written without the bother of an audience in mind.Almost all the poems have a storyteller's voice behind it. Consider these opening lines from ""The Lodger"": ""Potatoes were growing in the yard corner/ That September. They were the welcome wagon!""What distinguishes poetry from prose is the poet's expression of spontaneous feelings. Ted's expressions are honest, no doubt, but there's a certain ""designed to communicate"" pattern about them, which strips them of their natural aroma.This collection may provide the much awaited peep into Ted & Sylvia's married life, but please, don't call this poetry."
4,Brilliant work of poetry,"This is a brilliant work by a major 20th century poet. No doubt about it.I don't understand all of the continued antipathy toward Hughes by the Plath mob. Whatever his faults as a husband, Plath had suffered from depression for many years and had attempted suicide at least once. Regarding his destruction of some of Plath's writing, I would have burned the whole lot of it if it meant protecting my children. He made sure that Ariel was published, and for that, we should be grateful."
5,who knows,"I read the Birthday Letters like a novel rather than poetry, I couldn't put the book down. I have never subscribed to the Ted Hughes as monster views of some feminists, having read some of the work of Sylvia Plath and some biographies I found this book profoundly moving. To me the poems are full of love, passion, tenderness and regret. The book as a whole confirms that none of us really know what goes on in other peoples relationships and that it is all too easy to sit in judgement. This collection of poems offers us a little insight into the torment of living with and loving a deeply troubled human being."
2,Inferior Hughes,"I'm amazed at all the positive reviews. There are a few good poems in this volume, but so much of it is just special pleading. Hughes presents himself in a deterministic narrative in which he figures as someone caught in the overpowering ""Daddy"" myth. In other words, he is doomed from the beginning. As an excuse for his behavior, this does not convince. And why he did not see that such excuses diminished him and made him the ""little man"" Plath rejected is surprising. BIRTHDAY LETTERS does not include a poem that has come to light only recently--a poem in which Hughes acknowledges he was sleeping with another woman in the early morning hours when Plath killed herself."
4,for the lover of sylvia plath,"a deep look into the life of sylvia plath and how she affected her husband, ted hughes."
4,Book shows how personal expreriences effect poetry,"I cried when I started to read ""Birthday Letters"" by Ted Hughes. Having studied both Plath's poetry and novels such as ""The Bell Jar"" I emphasised with the life that Hughes was writing about. Through his painful and traumatic experiences expressed in his powerful and evocative language, great insight into the human mind was revealed."
3,Definitely for intermediate to advanced students,"The product moves very quickly into demonstraring what a classical Pilates workout entails. It is helpful to see the end goal, however I believe other products are more appropriate for begginer's.A thourough section on the basic elements of Pilates would have been helful"
1,What is a powerhouse?,"I've taken some pilates classes before, but looked forward to this video because it promotes the ""classical"" pilates method, and I'm interested in the philosophy of Joseph Pilates regarding exercise. While the exercises were literally ""true to form"", there is nothing in the voice-overs about the Pilates Method, description of the ""core"" or ""powerhouse"" or the reasons and science for the exercises, although the terminology is used.The music is also uninspiring, to say the least.As Pilates is touted as a mind-body exercise, the mind is an important component of the science of these exercises, but completely absent from the instruction of the Pilates Method.I could've just printed the exercises off the internet and performed them myself, saving myself both the money and the disappointment!"
1,hate it,what a waste of money. it's so 80's and not at all fun to follow. i'm sticking to denise austin from now on.
2,for pros only,"I've been taking Pilates classes for about 6 months and keep looking for a good video... careful, interesting, not overly easy or impossibly difficult. This isn't it. I think it is really designed for people who are at an expert level."
2,Not for beginners!,"I purchased this tape because of the high ratings listed on amazon, but I was sorely disappointed. Although there are beginner's and intermediate levels listed on the summary, this tape is completely insufficient for a Pilates beginner. The narrator speaks too quickly (and with a sometimes indecipherable accent) and often fails to give the breathing cues that are so importaint to pilates. There is a HUGE disparity between the intermediate and advanced levels, so it is very difficult to make the transition from one to the next. After rushing through the excercises, viewers are treated to a long-winded and pointless 'round table discussion' of Pilates, but it would be more helpful to have a thorough description of each excercise, with cautions regarding form. If you have not been practicing Pilates for some time, I would definitely not recommend starting with this tape."
3,Fine but Not Spectacular,"Though this DVD offers many levels, they are not offered alongside one another making the actual time spent performing the exercise at any given level very short. The background and scenery are uninteresting and uninspiring and the models performing the exercises are certainly quite fit but in no way friendly or encouraging. More importantly, there are no verbal cues during each exercise that relate to posturing or form, so if one were not experienced in pilates, it could be easy to injure onself. So, all in all, this dvd is fine but not spectacular."
3,Too fast for me!,"The exercises are the same that Ana Caban's video has, but she goes slower and that is good for me. I couldn't keep up with this program...one needs to be young and vigorous."
4,Great Hard Rock CD,"This cd is very good. It has many good songs, including ""Space Truckin"", ""Burn"", ""Woman from Tokyo"", ""Highway Star"", ""Smoke on the Water"", and my personal favorite, ""Hush"". Well worth the listed price."
2,two pieces,The cushion was in two pieces instead of one piece like the previous stearns cushions that I have purchased. I returned them and am waiting for my refund.
2,What to Do About Baby,My sister-in-law recommended this writer.The main femail character seemed whimpy!The male character was predictable.Almost gave it up.
5,There's No Such Thing as Throw Away People,"I don't live in the Ozarks, but I've associated with enough people living in the Rocky Mountain versions of the communities and people that Woodrell portrays in his books to know he does it spot on. It's depressing as hell because it's so real; the hopelessness, the attempts to rise above ending in disaster, usually because of a shortcut or other bad decision, all of it. Throw in his gift for prose and metaphor, and you have a writer that proves that crime writing can be as literary as anything else being published. This particular story is a dark one; my favorite character is the mother, who is also a prostitute, who knows the world and its unfairness better than anyone and seems to have found a kind of peace with it. Even so, she still feels all the pain when that peace is shattered. As for the narrator, he could be any one of a number of guys I've known. Powerful stuff. This book is a must-read. Many thanks to Busted Flush Press for reprinting it."
5,"Another ""Country Noir"" worth everyone's time","He's done it again. These sentences knock my socks off! I love Woodrell's outlandish analogies and his utterly American love of language. Great characters who love life and do anything they can to get what they know they deserve. If Woodrell could only teach 85% of fiction writers to write as densely, imaginatively and sparely (!) as he does there'd be more room on the shelves for really good books instead of the current invasion of encyclopedically thick tomes (zzzzzz...) that crowd bookstores and libraries."
5,Helpful book,This book is well written and easy to understand. It proved to be quite helpful with understanding and preparing for basic algebra.
2,Thanks Pete,"The songs are awesome. Chill, great groove. Pete Rock and other guests make it a habit to screw the songs up by giving shoutouts during each song. I'm guessing because each part they talk over has already been looped before in a hip-hop song. But that's kind of dumb to me because it's all about creativity. Could have been a fantastic album if not for it, but is ruined because of it.Don't bother."
5,THOUSANDS OF ROSES FOR EMMYLOU!,"Brave Emmylou made this album at a time when bluegrass was not fashionable at all. I never played it to friends but it's remained a firm favourite down the years. Her interpretations are just so right throughout, the selection is spot-on and the playing is superb. It's not easy to pick favourites, but the title track, Green Pastures, Darkest Hour, Jordan, Miss The Mississippi and Gold Watch & Chain are particularly appealing to me. Although I've discovered much beautiful new music now that bluegrass is in vogue again, I always return to this album as one collection exemplifying the absolute best of the genre."
3,Roses in the Snow,I have not yet received this item one month after purchase. Can only review it from sample clips.
1,not compatible with the PSP slim,"These speakers are not compatible with the PSP slim edition. Nowhere in the description is this mentioned. I ordered one, had it delivered and to my dismay, it will not fit in the docking staion or connections. WHen connecting to the AUX, the sound is barely legible. Do not get this system if you own a PSP Slim Edition"
1,What a horrible book!,"It's difficult to believe that the author of the wonderful Dorothy Martin mystery series is also the perpetrator of this terrible stinker. Stupid plot, stupid characters...yeccchhhhh!!!!!!"
1,I guess I got a lemon,"My wife used this iron for 2 days and it leaked more water than any iron I have ever owned. She lifted the ironing board to fold it up and put it away and water just poured out of the pad all over the floor. It promptly was returned and we bought another Rowenta. We had been using the same Rowenta for 7 years without any problems until it just stopped working. I was steered away from Rowenta after reading reviews of their latest models on Amazon. I should have stuck with it. The Rowenta we picked up at Kohls was half the price of this Bosch and works flawlessly. It's surprising since Bosch generally makes such quality goods. I guess mine was just a lemon, but I wasn't getting another in order to find out. An iron that cost this much should work, no if's, and's or but's."
5,Delightful and thoughtful reading,"This wonderful book by Eugene Peterson is not a detailed critical commentary about the Psalms, but a sublime introduction to their usefulness as examplary prayers. I found this book to be thoughtful, provocative, and very well-written."
3,"For an Overview, only.",I am not a historian but found this to be an interesting overview. If you are a historian -- you probably won't enjoy this one.
1,Poorly Written,"This is my first review on Amazon. Like many of the previous reviewers, I found this book poorly edited and the transitions left me circling back to understand what the author wished to convey. I have a molecular biology background and bought the book with the hope that Cantor would actually develop the life and struggles of civilization post-plague. He appears to be more interested in the world of politics and religion at the time of the plague."
1,how sad!,"I bought the book hoping to learn something new about the plague. I was influenced by the presence on the cover : New York Times Bestseller.I shall not finish this book, it is a pseudo-scientific writing intended to lure people like me.It has absolutely no charm, neither in its style, nor in its contents. All what Mr Cantor says is preposterous.It is even not worth of my criticism. How comes it could be published?"
2,May the plague take it!,"The author obviously knows his subject, and the book contains many fascinating tidbits. But the writing style and editing is so poor that much of the book's value is lost in the jumble. The first several chapters read like college course lecture notes strung together. The last several chapters include repetitions which should have been edited out. The efforts to explain family relationships and inheritances are convoluted and could have been stated more clearly with a little effort. Some of the claims Cantor makes about the results of the plague are far-fetched, and his supporting evidence does not bear them out. He also makes some very broad generalizations, such as claiming that nobility in the 14th century never thought deeply even though they read philosophical works and supported the arts. Surely there were a few thoughtful nobles! In all, a disappointment."
5,Some Original Thinking,"I picked up this text, thinking it would be informative; but certainly not interesting. Actually, it contained some very unique insights about the cause/effect relationships associated with the great plagues. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in European history.Good job, Mr. Cantor!!!"
3,Lukewarm,"On the positive side, I learned a few things. The history of property law and its connection to the Plague was interesting. The thoughts on anthrax and bubonic plague are certainly timely.On the down side, there wasn't the depth or breadth I had hoped for. It seemed that the author had a few ideas he liked to repeat frequently. Finally, the book needed a good editor to improve spelling, usage and the general flow of the book.The author helpfully includes a long bibliography. This always pleases me. Unfortunately, some of his remarks were scathing - and I thought inappropriate due to the poor editing of his own work."
1,Unfocussed and irrational,"Rather than attempting to present a well developed history of the plague in medieval Europe, Prof. Cantor chooses to discuss the evolution of the pestilence in terms of its cultural, economic and scientific ramifications. This is a worthy goal but, in Prof. Cantor's hands, one which offers no revelations. The very few interesting and valuable insights this book provides are easily obscured by irrelevant (though sometimes interesting) tangents, sloppy reasoning, unjustified conclusions, meaningless theological and cultural gibberish and, surprising for one of Prof. Cantor's scholarship, serious factual errors. None is more egregious than his casual observation that vast amounts of extraterrestial bacteria and viruses fall to the earth from outer space.Although short, this work is still far too long. Avoid it like, well, you know."
1,The world's worst-edited history book,"I bought this book from amazon.com and it was the most enormous disappointment with a history book I can recall. The book is chock-full of facts, but in no particular order or format - talk about BAD EDITING - YIPES !! A complete hodge-podge, a mish-mash -- it was quite impossible for me to even finish reading it."
1,A Plague on this Book,"Yes, the reviews are right: this book is a shocker. Wild speculation, repetition, endless miles of digression, and a pitiless, parochial morality are all there in spades. And I bet it gets even worse after Chapter 3. I am writing this only to get the average rating back down where it rightfully belongs.I weep for the trees that gave their bark for my copy."
2,In the Wake of the Plague...,"I'll grant that this book was maybe more entertaining and easier to read than many other accounts of the Black Death-- but that isn't enough to make this a great book on the Black Death. Cantor seemed so desperate to try to give readers a tiny taste of every sort of aspect surrounding the plague, he really didn't do a good job of writing about any one of these aspects. It wasn't the most academic book, and I felt he used some odd ideas and mentioned some strange other sources on the subject, rather than focusing on the more useful ones. For anyone really interested in the Black Death, I would not recommend this book to you..."
1,Leaves much to be desired,"Poorly written and superficial, this book does not deliver on the praise advertised on its cover. Interesting nuggets of information abound, but appear haphazard and disconnected from any structured argument. Trite commentaries are partnered with sobering topics which weakens the book's credibility, such as this quote about a historical account of family tensions in the peasantry: ""There was wife abuse and there was `a wicked wife who will not be corrected; her husband flees from her in fear of her tongue.' Many times growing up in Manitoba [Canada] I noticed shriveled-up, bitter women like that - and they had a lot to be bitter about."" Please."
1,Poor quality presentation,"I was surprised that Hay House thought this workshop was worthy of reproduction and resale. It's really awful! As others have commented in previous reviews, the delivery of the workshop is such that it's difficult to follow without physically being in the room. The presenter frequently speaks to audience members who are inaudible. She also often seems to be referring to slides that the listener obviously can't see. (""here, here, and this"") You get the sense that you are missing a lot of the content. But after a while you don't care. Much of the material consists of rambling personal stories that take a very long time to arrive at some sort of tedious point. Finally, her tone is surprisingly confrontational and decidedly unfriendly. She comes across as testy, judgmental, dismissive, and just plain cranky. Life is too short to spend hours of it listening to this! I think from now on I'm going to stick with Sounds True products for this genre."
3,Meh.,"I use this for my nails and my hair, it isn't as good for skin, imho. Maybe this winter has been extra brutal. I guess that's it. I'll give it another shot in the spring, maybe it will work better then. I also don't have anything remarkable to say about the scent because there isn't one. I do like the fact that I know how to pronounce Jojoba correctly though, that's nice."
5,Hair treatment,"I comb this into my hair about 2 hours before my shower, it has brought it back to life. Love knowing it's organic and a single ingredient. Honestly it's cheap and has made my hair fabulously alive. Does wonders for your skins also.Love this product!"
2,hard to manage,"Made for people with small hands, large bathroom counters, and desire to get soaked. This product does it's job, but is such a pain to use that I dred using it. The trigger is poorly placed, and the handle leaks even when you turn the waterpick off."
1,Money hungry gouger's,"This company has lost its way. I have purchase a ton of their books, have all the show DVD's, subscribe to the Cooks Illustrated at 24.95 and pay for the internet site another 29.95 . I went to find a recipe and was told I had to up grade to the ""Editors' Choice Cookbook Collection Membership Upgrade"" , this is over 29.95 annual fee for the site and the 24.95 for the subscription. Pure bull! That is gold digging and I will never renew my membership, who ever made that dumb decision needs to be toss out on there butts, That is an insult. They did not tell me that there would be an additional level fee until I went to find a simple way to prepare beans!! . I say keep it, I'll find some else that wants my business.I will do all in my power to make sure others know of this. IT IS WRONG! Don't become a sucker to these city slickers"
2,Good beginner magazine for the home cook - you can't get off their list,"This is a good magazine for the home cook that wants to branch-out from the standard Family Circle or Good Housekeeping no risk recipes.My BIG problem with this company is once they've got your contact information, you will receive more junk mail than you thought one company could generate; hawking every single publication they produce, relentlessly.I stopped subscribing and it took a year to stop receiving their snail spam; and there's no way to 'opt out' online"
2,Useful up to a point,"I have gotten Cooks for 2 years. The best thing was the no-ads policy, but now they have so much self promotional garbage that you have to tear out/off that it defeats the purpose. Some of their simple american fare recipes are really good, but they have kind of a podunk USA approach to international food. Tacos are made with hamburger. Their asian dishes are boring stir-frys or noodles. Their food reviews are really funny, chock full of nuts is the best french roast, Bullseye the best barbeque sauce and Doritos the best tortilla chip. Yeah OK maybe for people who make tacos with hamburger."
5,Cooking school magazine,"Opening this magazine is like taking a step into cooking school. The information and techniques I've learned have boosted my cooking to a whole new level.I really like the comarisons in cooking styles to achieve the best quality and report what extra steps work and which ones aren't necessary.Great magazine for those of us that like to cook, want to get better, but can't take the time or afford to go to cooking school."
3,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,I agree with D. Behrendt!! My son received several pieces for Christmas and I am extremely disappointed in all of them. The Portal of Fire is a nightmare to put together. The pieces do not snap together properly and when adding larger additions the other pieces begin to fall off. My son has not even begun to play with it and I have had to put it back together time and time again. I can only imagine the frustration and disappointment he is going to have when it falls apart during play. While the dragons are awesome and the detail is great these selections are not worth the money. The larger playsets are definately something I would keep away from younger children because the small pieces fall off easily and could pose a choking hazard. He also has the Ice Outpost and Fire Sentry which have proved to be alot of fun but both posed the same problems when putting together.
4,Good photo reference with some keying ability,"This book contains photos and descriptions of the macroalgae found on the Pacific Coast. The photos are usually of high quality, but some are not good representatives of the species. The descriptions are helpful for identification, but will not provide you with a conclusive answer in the same way that a more complicated dichotomous key would. Thus, the book is useful both for getting some idea of what algae you find, and for helping to confirm accuracy of photo-less dichotomous keys. It is especially useful for beginners, although those experienced in algae will be able to recognize most of the species without it since there are few species on the Pacific Coast.There is a very rudimentary key near the beginning of the book which can help point you in the right direction. This helps prevent thumbing through the entire book looking for a photo that is similar to algae that you have found.Overall a good algae identification companion book."
5,A great gift cookbook for men or women.,This book and its predescessor cover the full gamit of traditional home cooking for the South Plains area of Texas. Dishes are flavorful and hearty. They are the traditional fare for the hard-working cotton farmers and cattle ranchers of the area. These dishes are meant to fill up the belly and stick to the ribs. They are recipes from an area known for good food all year round from blustery winter to blistering summer.
5,A great intro to a great photographer,"Even though this is sold as a children's book, it is beautifully produced with the full approval of the Ansel Adams Trust, and it provides an excellent introduction to this fascinating man who once thought he would become a classical pianist. Ms. Gherman discusses not only the events, people, and surroundings that influenced Ansel Adams's work but also his incredible impact on the art of photography and the places he photographed. This book is perfect for budding photographers and long-time admirers of Ansel Adams, especially those who might be a bit daunted by his very dense autobiography or his complex technical manuals. An insightful and interesting read about his life and art, full of wonderful photographs of and by Ansel."
4,great gift,Bought this book as a present to give with one of AA's photographs to a friend in Europe that is not familiar with AA's work. Haven't read the book myself but chose this book because it had both text about him and his life as well as photograhps of his work and really good reviews
3,it's um...blue,"it is what it is, blue. It's definetly not as good as a normal flashlight and it gives you a headache if you use it often. I have mine in the storage unit as a spare.. pricey too"
4,A much stronger voice than Jack's.,"Joss' cover of Jack Whyte's tune is superior to the original in every way. A stronger voice, a funkier arrangement and a better (more subtle) guitarist in Little Beaver. This was one of the highlights of the Soul Sessions, a cd filled with highlights. The White Stripes' original sounds bland and predictable next to Joss.Looking forward to her upcoming disc of originals."
3,Seeking Justice,"Russell and Holmes set out seeking a kind of justice that is somewhat denied by the end of this rambling tale of constant characters and changing landscapes. King has great descriptions of all of it. The story is somewhat ragged. Holmes is shuttled off to London to rummage papers while Russell has her diversions in the country side along with a fast trip to Canada. Occasionally they get together, but not often enough. The two 'Arabs' from their previous trip to Palastine become very English along with all the trappings of a proud but disappearing family. The revealing of little discussed English history during WWI is sad, and one that most of us find hard to understand today, and the justice sought can never be found. This book is not light hearted entertainment. I want more of Russell and Holmes interaction that appeared in the previous books. Holmes is made to appear old and somewhat useless with Russell making too make quick moves with too many other people."
4,A Quality Story Requiring Patience,"This author has the courage to take chances, and warrants patience. So while the story doesn't have the entertaining repartee of earlier Russell/Holmes stories, it does have an ultimate point. The setting is the estate of the ""Landed Gentry"", which makes it hard for us of more modest means to feel much sympathy for their troubles. Yet, with patience on the part of the reader, the big-picture comes into focus when the story coalesces into an integrated whole by its powerful conclusion. Laurie R. King's depiction of the horrors of World War I puts the blood back into what Russell in a different book laments as ""death but no blood""."
5,Enjoyable entry in the series,"I think it's a wonderful book, and I also think it's great that Russell gets a chance to ""spread her wings"" and do more on her own. This is a ""Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes"" (""Mary Russell"" is the center focus here, remember, folks?) series, so I can understand the ""lack of Holmes,"" and Mary does pretty well on her own. Also, I love all of the business about the descriptions of Justice Hall itself--it has a life of its own, and becomes a character, just as the folks do.A good read, and another winner for the series!"
3,mmm...It's just OK.,"The picture shown kinda looks like the wood has a finish on it, but is completely unfinished. The finish really isn't a huge deal, but it ends up looking alot cheaper in person (like ikea pine)than it does in the picture(although it is made of a hard wood). Like alot of the other reviews stated, this thing doesn't stay together on it's own and needs to be glued. As far as functionality goes, it does what it is supposed to. I just assemled it in a flatter, longer shape and put it in a cabinet instead of on the counter because It just isn't that nice looking."
5,Genius,Extremely easy to assemble (with a mallet) and really beautiful. I ended up placing it with different configurations with a display case so now my wine looks like art. Excellent quality wood at a fantastic price. I almost bought the 9-bottle version for $25 from another website.
5,Quick solution,Very simple to assemble provided you use a rubber mallet; solved a unique storage problem quickly and with style.
5,Awesome wine rack,"I bought this wine rack as a present. It is easy to assemble, and can be assembled in different ways to fit what you need in your house. Very satisfied."
4,"Good, practical wine rack","Looks good and built well. It takes a bit of time to put it together, but it's kinda fun. Overall, very good value for money."
5,Love this wine rack!,"This rack is very well-built, and I highly recommend it. You should anticipate about an hour to assemble it correctly once it arrives. Also, you are going to need a hammer to assemble it. Anyway, great product!"
5,Great product for a budding wine collector !,"I bought this to store my growing wine collection. This is the perfect rack for my needs !!!!. Easy to assemble, great quality and scalable !."
4,"I like these modular racking systems, but they are about twice to three times more expensive that other rackings","This modular racking system lets you build custom racks where you need to fit them. I have many other racks that hold 120 bottles. Some are Redwood and some are Spruce, and they are less expensive, but are not customized to fit in tight areas. It took 2 of these to get enough spots for 80 bottles of wine. The Bonus is that these racking are big enough to accommodate Burgundy bottles and the larger Rhone bottles. Most bigger champagnes will not fit, but I had to go custom for a champagne shelf. These modular racks are quite sturdy, but don't even think about disassembling one. Once you build it and mallet the wood into place, it will break up if you try to pull it apart."
5,wine rack,"I ordered and received a stylish, compact and easily assembled wood wine rack that takes minimum room but keeps my wine very nicely."
3,adequate,"This does the job if you're looking for something simple and not perfect. It is impossible to build a large rack that is square as there are slight variations in the sizes of the pieces. So if you have OCD and require perfect geometry, this is not for you."
5,BEAUTIFUL !!!,"Journey, Well what can I say about this CD? From the melody to the words, I was made to reflect back on my own life journey. The lessons learned: past trials and tribulations, love lost and love desired, a look at things still needing to be worked out in my life, and a self review of my growth in Christ. Thanks and May Christ continue to bless you with all that life has to offer."
4,Jupiter&Saturn&Moon,"It was so nice to focus my new Galileo telescope to this star that turned to be Saturn with his rings at the end, and over a week later at early morning I could watch Jupiter with three of his moons. Amazing for the price. I hope to see mars soon."
3,Good starter telescope,"Good for starters, doesn't include good instructions so make sure you have a basic understanding how a telescope works and/or is adjusted.Also the software that comes with it, is really crappy. The interface looks like it was made for windows 95 and is not that helpful.But the telescope is very nice and has clear optics."
5,Perfect binder for a decent price,"It is so hard to find a one inch D-Ring binder and this is exactly what I wanted! Most one inch binders in stores are all the normal rings and I absolutely hate those. They ruin my pages and they eventually look terrible, but not with this! If you haven't had a D-Ring binder before I would highly recommend one and this is definitely cheaper than going to the store. Very happy with this purchase!"
5,Classic sci fi,Fantastic pirate story in science fiction setting! Hero goes from slave to ship captain. Learn about handling a sword to flying a space ship (and you still have to do your own math) There is more to the series and need help finding the rest of the books
3,Pictures worth a thousand words,"If you want a picture book - this is for you. Each page is literally covered with pictures of Riverine and Coastal craft. Most of the pictures are from the Vietnam era, but if you look closely you will find pictures of modern craft too - like the Patrol Boat, River (PBR) on the front cover. Overall the book has good pictures and captions, but only a small section of text in the beginning describing the Riverine doctrine and operations."
4,Worth Buying,"""Alias"" is no ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" or ""Angel,"" but still worth buying. Full of excellently choreographed fight scenes, great acting and well-written episodes. One of the best things about the show is Jennifer's Garner's acting, for which she won both an Emmy and a Golden Globe for. In fact, the reason alone is enough to buy this DVD set."
4,Spies rock!,"I stumbled across Alias while I was looking for a good show to watch on DVD, since there is such a low quality of television these days. I had never seen an episode before but decided to try it out with Season One. I'm so glad I did. Not only did I get hooked, but so did my two sisters. Now all three of us are obsessed. This show has cliffhangers almost every episode.However there aren't a whole lot of special features and the box designs change so much every season. Wheres the continuity!?The only reason why I gave it only 4 stars is because Season 2 is so much better!"
5,Don't miss this one!!!!,"I have been watching Alias since day one. At first it really did not do much for me, I just could not get into it, but wow how things change. Alias has become one of the main reasons my family spend quality time together. We are all hooked down to my 14 year old sister. The first season was great! Every story line ties in with one another, everything is a surprise. The best way I would describe this series would be like putting pieces to a puzzle together, except the pieces keep coming."
5,Alias Rocks,"JJ Abrams is a fantastic writer/producer. In Alias he has created a mind-bending, eye-popping series. Acting is superb. Jennifer Garner is both sweet and deadly. Co-stars, Victor Garber and Ron Rifkin could both read phone books and make them sound spellbindiing. Intelligent writing, though some suspension of disbelief is required. A real treat for those who like to follow puzzles as they unfold. Action-packed."
5,Anxiously Awaiting Alias,"Alias is the only TV show I do not miss. Great blend of plot, characterization, and dialogue, plus fun gadgetry. Action, drama, humour, angst, and UST. What more could you ask for? It's cinema-quality on the small screen. And we want the DVDs (first season and subsequent) in the US."
5,Good entertainment,"The character's physical and mental prowess is not typical of the average person, but their moral dilemmas and not always knowing whom they can trust are definitely things we can all identify with. As well, the series is well written; it is meant to entertain, not brainwash like too much of the trash that passes for entertainment these days. This series is clean, taut, and action packed. Very enjoyable."
5,Great show ! We want the DVDs...Now !!,"""Alias"" is a great show, one of the most compelling new shows from the 2001/2002 season. Although the concept of the show is far from being original, the show brillantly managed to give us the impression we were watching something new. Once you've seen an episode, you cannot help watching them all. Jennifer Garner, as Sidney Bristow, is wonderful, as is the supporting cast. The modern style, the sustained rythm, the countless cliffhangers, the catchy soundtrack : ""Alias"" already is a classic.The DVD edition can only enhance the numerous qualities and do justice to this mesmerizing show."
1,All the Excitement of Watching Jello Set,"Where does one start to explain how bad this thing is?With the idea that a college freshman coed is recruited into a super-secret arm of the CIA? And that 4 or 5 years later, she's a super-spy, fluent in a zillion languages?Or with the utter lack of chemistry among the various characters, including and especially Jennifer Garner and her metrosexual fiancee?Or with Garner's atrocious acting?Or with the plodding pace and lack of energy?Or with the cringe-making dialogue?What a mess."
3,"A Fun, Bubblegum-Pop Kind of Spy Show","This was a fun, bubble-gum pop kind of a show in its day. I was a fan when it first aired, largely because it featured some engaging performances by the principles and because the producers were able to create some fun (albeit it often wholly preposterous) storylines on a limited TV budget. Garner, Garber, and Rifkin are especially good, although the talents of Carl Lumbly, Bradley Cooper, and Kevin Weisman should not be overlooked. Good, fun entertainment, although the first two seasons are really the only two worth investing in. After Season 2, the plots get a little too stale or a little too convoluted. But if you're looking for two solid seasons of entertainment and can afford to skip the rest, this is a solid bet."
3,"Was it really new, Amazon?","I LOVED Alias when it was on television, and watched it religiously. I bought Season 1 on DVD to relive the show, and was disappointed that disc 3 seemed to be damaged somehow. The product was listed ""new"" and sold by Amazon.com, so I assumed it was legitimately new. I don't know if it is just old or what, but the end of disc 3 was choppy and impossible to watch. Good thing I know what happens. :)"
2,Why waste your tme...?,"I like JG (though not in this) and the acting is good overall, production values the same but just tired story lines and too many holes. Just feels fake and unrealistic. If you like your dialogue made for TV then you can spend your time on this but there are far better stories out there."
4,Distracted Enjoyment,"While I am enjoying the storylines thus far, admittedly there are things I am becoming incredibly distracted by. The main one is the hideous wigs she dons for just about every mission. The colors and styles are just SO atrocious. Aren't spies most effective when they are able to fly under the radar? Next? Jennifer Garners exaggerated posture. She throws her shoulders so far back when she walks, that I keep expecting her to tip over!! These things just take me completely out of the action."
1,Ughhhhhhhhhh.........................,"Someone please take this show off the air, it is so bland and so superficial, not to mention boring, boring, boring. My mother watches it and I have absolutely no idea why she likes it , it's beyond me. They always cancels the good shows and leave the stupid ones on, once again can someone tell me why?"
2,it is a very simple book,"I was quite disappointed with this book. i thought there are some trick or technique to improve memory. but in fact it is more about common sense stuff. which i already know. and you wonder where the author does his research about the knowledge he gathers.anyway. i gather if his advice is eat well, be active. then why bother reading this book ?"
1,Depressing...,"Was hoping to find a nice Christian movie to watch with my husband...I picked the wrong one. I understood there would be an abduction, but I was hoping for something with more of a ""happily ever after"". Things in the movie just went from bad to worse to worse...quite depressing."
1,Not for suitable for children.,"This movie is definitely not a family friendly movie. I watched this with my daughter thinking it would be a wholesome movie. Disturbing theme, definitely more for adults, although it was too disturbing for me. I didn't care for it."
3,This is the Psalm version used in the Liturgy of Hours,"This book contains the same translation of the Psalms that is used in the official English version of the Catholic Liturgy of Hours. It has all 150 Psalms, complete and unedited. (The Liturgy of Hours omits several imprecatory Psalms, and some imprecatory parts of Psalms that were retained. Compare Ps. 109 from this book and Ps. 110 from Sunday, Evening Prayer II for an especially bad example.) It is a useful companion to the Liturgy of Hours.This is the original Grail Psalter, and not the recently published ""inclusive-language"" edition."
4,Disco George,"The photo on the inside cover of George wearing a disco leisure suit is amusing. But what the heck--it was the late '70s and the height of disco. That's not to say this album is anything like disco, even though there's a smattering of disco beat here and there. Regardless, this album has some great tunes. Many of the best tracks follow George's formula of stating the theme or his own interpretation of a popular tune and then launching into a masterful jam solo before coming back to the main theme. Most of my favorites are the instrumentals, especially ""Livin' Inside Your Love,"" ""Nassau Day,"" ""Soulful Strut,"" ""Prelude to Fall,"" and more. On the other hand, ""Love Ballad"" and ""A Change is Gonna Come"" are great vocal performances by George. This album was a good follow up to ""Breezin',"" even if not in the same ""classic"" category as ""Breezin'"" (the disco suit ruined the chance of gaining that honor). Then again, there's a bit more material on this one."
3,"Generally decent, but might suffer from lack of focus","This book is like a textbook. It's structured with chapters on various industries, history, and the process.It's also like a historical memoir, with profiles of many people the author knows personally.Somewhere in the middle, we lose something.For example, when describing historical facts, you get the sense that the author has pulled back. Judgements aren't made, interpretations are scarce. Mixed with the profiles, there's this nagging feeling that the author would never really criticize anyone. Tactful to the extreme is how it could be described, and as a result, the book does not have a soul.Having said all that, it's kind of funny reading the bits on Drexel and the profile on Miliken. Everyone has already knocked them down, but Wasserstein doesn't kick a dead horse. That'd be too easy. He could write epitaths for villains."
3,okay book,"I'm a banker. This book is about banking deals, no stories, no filler, just cases. Good read of you want to learn about older mega deals. I think if you are a non-banker you will be bored out of your mind reading this book."
4,Xenadrine EFX,A truely remarkable product! I have been on it for less than a week and gone down a belt size already! Yes there are some slight side effects but if you make sure that you eat enough and drink plenty of water with this product then they really are minimal. The weight really does fall off so stick with it even if you do suffer slight side effects! Brilliant!
5,Winter Hair Bues...,"After only a few days, I have found Paul Mitchell Instant Moisture Daily Treatment fantastic for curing my dry winter hair blues! It's worth the extra buck folks..."
4,good product and good service.,"The DVD is a good addition to Bryan Kest's old DVD, the 3-in-1 program. I still like the old DVD better."
4,One of MF's finest,"This album has been one of my favorites, especially the first five songs, which would be side one of the original vinyl release. I think the energy sags just a bit in the second half, but there aren't any clunkers here. You know what to expect from Michael Franks in terms of smooth jazzy songs and sly wordplay. One Bad Habit is Michael near the top of his game.My biggest disappointment with the CD is that either a substandard master tape was used for remastering, or else the masters have softened up over the years, or the mastering was just careless -- the sound just doesn't have the clarity and punch of the original vinyl, mastered by Doug Sax at the Mastering Lab, if my recollection is correct.This isn't a major problem. The sound is good, but I thought it should have been more exciting. If you can find a clean vinyl copy, it might actually be a better purchase, if your turntable is good enough to retrieve the extra information from the grooves."
2,More junk from China,"This seemed to be a good deal, but it is junk like all of the other thermometers I have recently purchased. It's new home is in the junk drawer. I think it is very poorly made, it also doesn't correctly read temperatures. We all have a temperature of 84 degrees everytime I try to use it?? My advise would be not to waste your money. Oh, and did I mention it is made in China........"
1,Expensive for something that doesn't work!,This thermometer just doesn't work. We took it out of the package and it told us that my husband and I were 95 degrees and our baby 96. We tried all the attachments (minus rectal). So disappointing since we spent so much money on the darn thing. Argh. Don't buy. Our pediatrician said the more basic $8 plain old thermometers are better than these big fancy ones.
1,"Terrible customer service, bad battery","I had two terrible experiences with summer and will never buy their products again. First, they shipped me a thermometer that didn't work. I took the time to replace the battery and it will didn't work. I paid $9 for the themometer, called summer, and they wanted to wait until they received the first thermometer to replace it. They said they would pay for shipping but couldn't successfully send me a pre-paid envelope through email. Apparently they just didn't take the time to do it. I finally just bought another one, because it was only $9. Went to use it for the first time and...the battery had leaked all over the unit. This company is useless."
2,Bad quality,There's not much to like about this cap. The flames on the bill don't line up with the ones on the crown. Cheap feeling too.
3,Good for high seats,"I bought this at Walmart a year ago, I bike daily 10-15 miles at 10-22 mph on a bike path it lasted about two or three months, it holds a lot but I normaly keep a cliff bar, keys, headlamp and rear clip on light I case I get caught ridding late. There is allways extra room. But needs clearance as the rear part of the bag where the zipper is hangs lower than the part attached to the seat and hits your back tire and rubs if you don't have a high seat"
4,Not Bad at All,"I used this bag for about a year, 6,000 + miles. The velcro straps are very secure I never had a problem with them coming lose or, undone. I am switching bags because it is a bit to small for my needs, and the stitching on top of the bag that holds the strap to the bag let go. I carry 2 inner tubes, yes I have had 2 flats on one ride, a Topeak multi tool, a Leatherman multi tool, a small air pump, 2 CO2s and applicator, a couple of chain links, and a couple of paper towels. Getting all of this in the bag is a challenge I have put strain on the zipper without problem. This is a well made bag, if it was a bit larger I would buy it again. Pedal fast and stay in the drops.3days laterI ordered The Topeak Medium bag. It is considerably smaller than this one + the straps are thinner. I am returning the Topeak and and going back to this bag. At under $9.00 I am stealing"
5,Excellent quality,Bell has always an excellent quality at affordable price. It was easy to fix on the bike and keeps my small things while riding.
3,One Flaw,"As some other reviewers have pointed out, this bag does have one flaw. The two velcro straps at the top are hard to get around the little bars on the bottom of the seat, which can cause it to droop a little. Just zip tie the bag into place and there shouldn't be a problem. It has room enough for a patch kit, multi-tool, keys, cable lock, etc..."
1,Only last a dozen uses!,"I bought this at a local sports store and barely used it before the zipper started coming apart. Then after about only a dozen uses before the zipper broken off completely. The zelco also repeated came loose and left the bag dangling. Stay away from this brand. You are better off buying one, slightly higher priced bag than several cheap ones."
1,Zipper broke on first day!,"Ther size of this bag was perfect for me. Held a couple of c02 cartridges, 2 spare tires, some tools, small bottle of sunscreen, but, the zipper broke on the first day. Seller let me return with no problems but I wouldn't buy this bag."
1,Lasted about a year and fell completely apart,"I bought this bag @ Walmart about a year ago for $15. I got it to hold an extra tube, some quick patches, and some tire tools. It seemed like it did this well, but the seams started coming apart after about 6 months of use. Tried Duct taping it, and that helped it hold up for a little while longer until the entire thing came unseamed... Even along the top!! To be fair, I do most of my riding on trails with jumps, roots, and rocks. However, I would expect a bag made of a fake canvas to last longer than this. Lesson learned... You get what you pay for. I wouldn't recommend this bag to anyone, seems a waste to buy a new seatbag every year. Save your $$ and get something nicer."
3,Good and depends..,"I have always liked this bag until I bought the super flash light and tried to install it under the seat. Simply, they both won't sit together, unless you are very tall and you can raise your seat high enough.The bag could have been a little less harsh in the outside design and size so it wouldn't block too much space. The ties that rap underneath the seat to catch it are not very practical but they are ok, could have been easier to reach.Good capacity for small tools like multifunctional and tire patching tools. Price is good. I'd recommend it if you aren't planning to buy Super Flash light and install it under the seat, or if you are not going to dedicate the under-seat area to anything else. I hope this helps."
2,music for people with no taste,"I HATE DIRE STRAITS.THEY RANK AMONGST MY TOP TEN WORST BANDS OF ALL TIME AFTER GREEN DAY,NIRVANA AND GUNS N ROSES.THEY ONLY MADE TWO DECENT SONGS IN BROTHERS IN ARMS AND SULTANS OF SWING.REST OF THEIR ALBUMS AND SONGS ARE TERRIBLE.LED ZEPPELIN AND PINK FLOYD ARE MUCH BETTER.GET LED ZEPPELIN'S DEBUT CD INSTEAD."
1,OVERRATED,"I can't imagine anyone hating all the other Dire Straits albums.They are terrific, and this one you like and Brothers in Arms areOVERRATED!!!!!!!! Water of Love, In The Gallery, and Wild West End are dumb and are just for BABIES....This album only has 1 good song in Sultans of Swing, rest BORING. GET MAKING MOVIESLOVE OVER GOLD, AND ON EVERY STREET INSTED. 1 STAR.............."
5,Great Debut Album By Dire Straits,"DIRE STRAITS is a great debut album by the band of the same name. The sound is a blend of J.J. Cale, BROTHERS AND SISTERS-era Allman Brothers Band, and Eric Clapton circa 461 OCEAN BOULEVARD, with a lot of mystique added. The best songs here are ""Down To The Waterline"" and ""Sultans Of Swing"", the latter a tribute to a jazz band who know that they'll never hit the big time, but do it for the love of the music. This CD is a must-own for anyone who thinks that well-played, high-quality rock & roll died with the punk explosion."
3,Mediocre,"Hindemith, a master mind of composition, is unjustly represented in this recording. This is a recording that was never meant to be bought not only because of the lack of proper editing technology, but because of the poor playing of the orchestra. Hindemith does however manage to make some musical ideas emerge from what was then a newly formed orchestra. The Varations for Piano however, is a bit higher in quality and worth buying."
5,excellent,emmylou harris is such a wonderful artist. I really enjoy all of her musicand have for years.
2,Not A Recommended book,"I have read this book and it's waste of time and money, becuse it does not learn how to write script with kix(for example).you can read the help that come with kix and learn more.This book is more in exploring the resource kit then explening how to write scripts."
5,AWESOME BOOK!,"I've never seen a book like this! This guy must be an admin because everything here is what I do on a daily basis. Managing user/groups, inventory, imaging, messaging - you name it - its in here. And since my job is forcing Windows 2000 down my throat, its great that this book covers Windows 9x/ME/NT and 2000!!!Also whats the other cool part is that I just bought it for Windows Scripting Host and know I can learn Kixstart and shell scripting all in the same shot!Definately worth it!"
4,"The Piano Tuner, by Daniel Mason. Review by John Allen","Mason has produced a brilliant work, and since so many have outlined the story and commented on it, I won't go over old ground. Suffice to say that the only problem I find is the Americanisation of certain words and/or phrases.For instance, since Drake is English, the word Specialty (as in Erards-a-Specialty) should be Speciality (with the i). This would be in keeping not only with the country he lives in (England) but also the era.Again, the term 'tucked in back' (page 86, last para.) would be 'tucked in at the back', or 'tucked in behind'.A reprint might also correct 'facade' to 'faade', where the cedilla softens the 'c'.There are perhaps a few other instances of Americanisation, but since the book was written primarily for the US market, at least initially, the publishers probably felt these errors allowable. Overall, however, they do not detract from what is undoubtedly a wonderful book.John Allen"
5,A truly great story,"A story, a kind of poem, and a kind of allegory, all wrapped up in one neat little package.In 1886 an unassuming middle-aged British piano tuner named Edgar Drake is called to the War Office and given a rather unusual commission. He is to travel to Burma (now known as Myanmar) and travel into the wilderness to tune a piano shipped there at the request of one Anthony Carroll, a surgeon attached to a unit of Her Majesty's armed forces.From this simple and somewhat off-kilter idea emerges a wonderful tale of music, love, philosophy, and of stories within this story. Daniel Mason's first novel is an auspicious debut and one hopes that his next work will be just as good, although I don't see how he could top or even equal this.I will say that the final resolution of the story was somewhat anticlimactic, but it does not take away from the power of the rest of the book."
2,A Dense Disappointment,"I wanted to enjoy this book. The first few pages demonstrate that Mason is a more than capable writer, his sentences poetic and his tone believably 19th century. But very quickly it is apparent that this is going to be a long haul. The characterizations are flat. Dr. Carroll is a huge letdown when he finally makes his appearance (actually, he's absent most of the time even after his entrance), and Mr. Drake so quickly devotes himself to this milktoast Svengali that the reader concludes he never had a self to lose to the mysteries of Burma. The book ultimately feels like a depository for every fact about Burma that Mason was able to scrape up in his year of research there, thus he succeeds in creating a lush stage for the action but unfortunately casts his story with puppets."
5,Haunting and Fascinating,"This novel is a delightful journey through a world that has been largely lost to history. From the first chapter when we learn of Edgar's mission, to the last chapter when we learn of his fate, Mason never ceases to evoke anything but sheer wonder and awe.Amazing book. I loved it."
5,address unknown,Hard to believe that so much emotion can be loaded into such a short book. It's should be read by all but especially those of us who lived through WWII.
5,One of the best short stories written and still relevant,"An expertly written and moving short story set during the rise of 1930's Nationalism in Germany. Using the format of a series of correspondence betwen two business partners in the art trade, it traces their close relationship and how this develops when one returns to his German homeland at a time when Hitler is rising to power.Obviously it helps to have an understanding of the historical background, but I found this very moving.Even in the 21st century this still has relevance, with many countries undergoing uprisings, rebellions and the rise of theocracies and dictatorships with their sinister population control.This short story is a must read. The minor investment in time to complete reading this novella is worth it!"
1,Paige,Very frustrating I bought this game for Xbox and it won't work. I'm was extremely disappointed and felt that I got ripped off.
5,Life as cattle at a slaughterhouse is better than this.,"Be thankful you live where ever you live, and not in North Korea. This book must be read by human rights advocates everywhere. The atrocities In North Korea that go unnoticed by most of the world must be put to light. Imagine growing up in a place where your teachers beat you and are armed with pistols. Imagine being forced to work while having almost nothing to eat. The conditions at North Korean concentration camps are just as bad as Nazi concentration camps, if not worse. Many are killed for little or no reason, such as sexual relations or eating rats or insects to survive. A gut-wrenching look inside the world's last remaining Stalinist society, this book will make you feel 10 times happier about the country you live in."
4,Aquariums of Pyongyang,"Amazing story and well delivered. The last vestige of Communisim on the planet and it should not last if the truth is told. The Dear Leader and his Son (and hopefully it ENDS right THERE) have destroyed a culture and a people. They should just fade away and 'let their people go'. What is so surprising is the constant flow of 'believers' who return from progress and prosperity from overseas (namely Japan) only to be inprisoned by the Culture of Corruption. Otherwise known as the Norks. A cleptrocracy if there ever was one. The Koreans in the north deserve better. Much better.Good book, quick delivery."
3,Definitely not my favorite boots,Although super cute these boots take some getting used to. VERY slippery when walking on carpet they are a little easier on floor or concrete. There is no zipper on the sides so you have to sit down to pull them on and off. They are also a little loose on me.
4,Especially good choral movement.,"This is another instance, I think, where Rafael Kubelik's live recording outshines his studio effort with the same (Bavarian Radio Symphony) orchestra. While there are performances to like in Kubelik's unusual Beethoven project on DG, a different orchestra for each symphony, this disc and the two Audite releases (2,6 on one, 4,5on the other) sound better and have much greater drive and impact. The final movement of this Beethoven's ninth is especially well done, with superior sound and performance to the previous studio effort."
2,A fair review of the class.,"The book provides a thorough description and explanation of all the topics covered on the AP exam. However, it could use a few more additional practice tests and problems to achieve a better sense of the test."
4,Flash-a true master,"Grandmaster Flash is truly the DJ of all time and he definitely proved it by releasing this breathtaking mix.A true pioneer and creator of ""The Message"". The guy was obviously light years ahead of everyone back then as well as today. This mix starts off with Flash's cool intro changing into Nu Shooz-I cant wait.The mixmaster includes The Fatback Band-I found Lovin' which had one of the tightest beats for 1984.Flash also includes monster tracks such as D-Train's you're the one for me,Indeep's Last night a Dj saved my life as well as Afrika Bambataas' Planet Rock where he adds some of his own scratching in a phenomenal way. I also had a chance to see him live in SF a few months ago and i honestly lost my mind. If you are into old school classics and can appreciate good music you have to buy this cd. A true classic with over 70 minutes of the best mixing and scratching. Flash is undoubtedly the best Dj of all time."
1,What is this garbage?,"When I bought this Cd, i went in with an open mind. I gave it a chance but i think it (is bad)!! How big of an art nerd do I have to be to like this (...). Please buy some new Cd's and do not listen to this(...)"
3,Edifice vs Artifice,"One of the most eagerly anticipated albums of the year is also one of the most lengthy. Compared with previous offerings, this is Godspeed's magnum opus, and their ability to keep the listener focused over almost ninety minutes suffers at the hands of their ambitions. Less substantial ambient meanderings are stretched beyond their limited potential and the band's rockish crescendos have become more predictable and overtly grandiose, something at odds with their original manifesto to champion the cause of the marginalised and downtrodden. This album does have a few moments of breathtaking beauty, but they are rendered less effective by the project's bulk and inconsistency."
5,solid,"This is another great release from GYBE. Two solid CD's of deliberate music. While this release, too, includes some recorded voice overs, they aren't tiresome like the fanatical diatribes found on the first two releases. Those parts are sometimes painful to endure! But listen now and enjoy without fear of some blathering freak interupting your fun!"
1,D-d-d-don't believe the hype!,"Sorry, kids! I feel like I'm in a spaghetti factory, such grandiose _noodling_ surrounds me. Drone and dirge-like cadence a good song make not! (I'm not saying that such factors explicitly cannot exist in beautiful music: take Flying Saucer Attack and Low as examples to the contrary.)GYBE is FSA without real grit and heart; GYBE is Low without innocence and sweetness that rather seem appropriate when accompanying childlike melodies.What we have here is a half-pair of oxen, spherical![Note: Yes, I've seen GYBE live (admittedly, they were touring with songs from f#a#(sp?) and Slow Riot for Krazy Kanada or what have you) and-- while I'll be the first to say that LYSFLATH is better than the supreme display of nerdliness I witnessed then, it still failed to elicit one one-thousandth of the reaction that a Low Mimi/Alan-harmonized word can conjure.]"
2,eh,"Note how most of the folks reviewing this thing can't help but gush endlessly about it - were it not for the 1000-word limit there would be some novels posted here.That's kind of how the music is... blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I tend to go on autopilot every time I listen to it. Maybe some unknown piece of my subconscious is digging it though..."
2,I wouldn't buy this again,"The pluses for this umbrella: the size, the tilting feature, the neutral color, the comparative value, free shipping with Amazon Prime (this motivates a lot of my purchase choices). The minuses: it does not provide much shade, the crank handle is difficult to operate, AND one spoke popped through the material on the very first use! My husband was able to fix the umbrella, but he noted that it was shoddily constructed and needed substantial reinforcement. Why didn't we return it? Not worth the hassle. Were it to do all over again, I'd skip this umbrella and purchase another."
5,Just what I needed.,This product does a great job keeping the sun off of us when we are sitting at our outside table. The first one I received arrived damaged but Amazon's customer service was fantastic and I was able to replace it with a minimum of hassle. The replacement works well and seems quite sturdy. The ability to tilt the umbrella is really helpful when the sun is low in the sky (but just as hot here in Vegas).
2,Coolaroo Pebble 8' Square Market Umbrella model #339319,"This umbrella is light weight, crank easy to use, the covering allows much too much sun light and it's heat thru the fabric. Does not provide shade, the glare is soo extreme one must squint to sit under the umbrella."
2,A songwriter's songwriter,"Meir Ariel struggled for a long - time before he became a well- known singer, and this though he was known and respected by many of the most important entertainers of Israel.He has a distinctive, and somewhat gloomy and perhaps even off- putting style. When I first heard his famous song 'Terminal' I could not understand what he was getting at.He was considered by many to be one of the most gifted composers of lyrics among Israeli songwriters, with a real feeling for the Hebrew language.He unfortunately passed away young, around the age of fifty and so was in the limelight only for a short- time.Yet his musical heritage has become part of the repertoire of Israeli popular song."
1,WOULD NOT RECOMMEND - Cheaply made,"I would not recommend buying this product. After using one on 3 ears of corn, it fell apart. I thought maybe it was just that one, so I tried another cutter(I had ordered 4 of them) and that too fell apart after using on only 2 ears of corn. It was a big disappointment. This product is cheaply made."
1,Never gets even lukewarm,The film is standard for action films. It is the standard plots without a twist or turn of any type in sight. Add canned behavior and canned speeches and you have.. Boiling Point. I am still trying to figure out how they got that title. There is NOTHING boiling in this not even a time limit.Bad guys try to earn some money. Cops cause problems. Waitress who loves the guy and says goes away but has a heart of gold [make her a hooker and it will really be stereotype] and 92 minutes of sheer boredom and quick fingers on the fast foreward to the good parts which narrows the time down to about 10 minutes if you are easily entertained.I usually say if you have to see or read it rent it or go to the library and get it. In this cases skip it. It was bad when I watched it when it came out in VHS and it is still bad in DVD. Wesley must have needed a paycheck that week.
3,"Simmer Me Timbers, Lad","This film picks up more of a cult interest, due to the Viggo Mortenson factor and a couple of other interesting things going on. The scriptwriter should have waited until ""Heat"" came out before offering this up as a tension builder.The way the scenes went back and forth from crook to cop was interesting in a satirical way.Pulling Valerie Perrine out of retirement was another surprse cameo.The noir attempt did not work on anyone who knew Newark from LA. Dennis Hopper was too wrapped up in the 40's, making you think he was going ""Back to Future"" on us here. The explosion expected, the one where Viggo outwits Hopper, does not happen, or vice versa. Instead they stop the action and shut down with a lame ending to a promising caper flick.The dangerous charm of Viggo burns into your memory. A Michael Mann would take this flat script to greater heights."
2,pointless 80's homage obscures better real thing,"Kids, blow these perfectly average (except the Console) tunes off and go to the source: Lime, Telex, Visage, Ultravox. The idea that there is anything 21st century about these tunes is ridiculous... I think some of us need to unplug our headphones and smell the nano-grease.- a biotic garage sound hacker"
3,acoustic,i bought this because i own an acoustic guitar. this one keeps my guitar from cracking. it works so far.
5,Way too short,"If you love good comedy - the kind of stuff Nick At Nite used to show and we all loved, (then decided they had money now so they would show stupid stuff like Emergency! --- but thats another topic). A cameo from Bob Hope gets a laugh out loud."
2,No longer up-to-date and revisions are piecemeal.,"I've used this as a text for several years, but am switching to another text. Although it has served art history well for decades, in the past ten or fifteen years revisions appear piecemeal. In particular, women artists are poorly represented. Illustrations of art by women tend to be of their more conventional rather than innovative works, as in the case of Artemisia Gentileschi and Berthe Morisot and Mary Cassatt. Feminist challenges to entrenched approaches to art history have not been presented adequately, in my opinion."
1,Poorly organized material,"I bought this book because it was the most recently published title on JSF, even though I like Horstmann's writing style and would have bought the Geary and Horstmann book if it hadn't seemed likely to be a little out of date. After trying to work my way through disorganized discussions of individual points that were not tied to any clear examples or to other aspects of JSF, shifting forwards and backs trying to string information together into simple working examples, I read a few sample chapters of the Horstmann book online, and was reminded of what a pleasure a well-written book can be. Coming from a Struts programming background, I had expected learning JSF to be rather straightforward. I expect it to be after I replace this book."
5,Great Product,I love this product and have been using it for years. I have ordered it multiple times. I first bought it after my very energetic kittens raced across my dining room table and shattered a ceramic piece I held very dear. Now I anchor everything down with Museum Putty as soon as I get it. It has even worked on certain glass pieces for me. And my cats are free to race as they please!
4,Lovin' it,"It's hard to find a good selection of oldies, but I had plenty to choose from. I'm happy with the CD."
1,No Thanks,"Unless you have little kids to watch this movie don't waste your time or your money. It is cute, but needs little kids to enjoy it and even my grandkids are too old now. Glad I rented it first and saved the purchase price."
1,Compassion for animals,"Thank you ""Animal treatment on the set"" - My family is an animal lover and this movie WILL NOT be in our collection of ""Family Films."" I wish Disney and these powerful actors would use their power to teach people to have compassion for animals. APPARENTLY the ""film production company"" DID NOT do their best to look out for the welfare of the animals. Puppies did die. The trainers and breeders need to be more reponsible and caring. And anyone else involved in the making of this film is responsible for the puppies. People should not just to turn the other way when animals are not being cared for properly. The puppies deaths are heartbreaking."
4,Dj Krush never lets me down!,"This is another very good album from Dj Krush, this amazing japanese dj who's never made a record I didn't like! All the tracks are great, but especialy track nr 2, where krush make an exellent heavy-hiphop-influenced extacy together with Balck Thought from ""Roots"". I warmly recomand this and every record dj krush have released. You will not be dissapointed!"
5,Great for the Price!!,"The quality of this DVD player is absolutely amazing. The progressive scan technology looks great even on a normal TV! The sound quality is unmatched and along with Dolby Digital 5.1 there is two sweets that make this deal amazing. The first is Dolby Pro-Logic 2, which is great for watching TVmovies and other nice programing encoded for this format. It is also GREAT for the GameCube which uses Pro-Logic 2 for surround! The best part of this deal is the DTS support!!! DTS for under $200!!!!! When I turn this DVD player to widescreen and then use the 16:9 aspect ratio on my 32"" Flat CRT TV the quality is similar to HDTV!! Make sure when you get it and you are using a 4:3 display to change the setting on the system to tell it that you are using 4:3 otherwise it will default to wide and it will look bad on your TV!! Great buy!"
4,Great HDTV for 1st Exp.,"I got this TV yesterday, and let me say, it is perfect, i got it from circuit city for $550. Was looking at the 27'' Olevia version, but this caught my eye. The picture quality isnt great without an HD subscription, but it is still good. It has everything you need unless youre into more technical TVs.Menu is fantastic (short and sweet). So far my XBox360 looks like bliss hooked up to it. All i need is a HDMI cable (cablesforless.com) and im set!One tiny winy little thing is that when it is off the blue LED light lights up the bedroom so i turn it off from the back, but its perfect. I havent had any problems with it like the other reviews here. It comes with a 1yr warranty already so i didnt get a 3yr deal. I say if you've done a lot of research and are on the edge, buy it, if you want excellent picture quality, make sure you have a HD subcription for HD channels!"
1,On its way back,This DVD player failed to perform right out of the box and is now on its way back to amazon. I have always preferred Toshiba video products and this is my first bad experience with them. I tried this unit with three different DVDs from Netflix. All experienced long periods (i.e. minutes) without any video output and when there was a signal it was often shifted to red. All three DVDs played without a problem in my older Toshiba player. There's a reason this model is so inexpensive. My suggestion is that you look elseware.
1,It's a great player when it works,"We got this for Christmas because it had so many features for a relatively low price, and had good reviews. Unfortunately, within a couple of days--after, sadly, we'd trashed the packaging--it began locking up on us. Turn it on, load a DVD, and suddenly it won't play, won't eject the disc tray, won't do anything. Toshiba said we needed to unplug it for five minutes and it would reset itself and work. Turns out that does the trick, but it's very annoying to have to keep doing it most of the time we want to play DVDs. Perhaps it's an unusual glitch and you'll have better luck, but Toshiba had heard of the problem. Save your packaging, just in case!"
1,Fake rosicrucianism,"Max heindel started his own form of Rosicrucianism. And this book is what it became. He hasn't had any contacts with other rosicrucian groups and kinda made up his own philosophy. It may be interesting reading, but if you are a real rosicrucian, you will be thouroughly disapointed."
1,"Back of tube exploded, ruined my caulk gun","On the first use, the back of the tube exploded and covered the entire caulk gun, which is now ruined as a result of using this faulty product. Now I need to buy new sealant and a new caulk gun."
2,Disappointed,Setting the clock is nonstandard and not intuitive. Clock has repeatedly changed settings spontaneously and sometimes had to be coaxed back to showing the time.
2,Closer to being a watch size,"The clock was not very big, and I was under the impression it was at least 2"" in size. 1"" is closer to the actual size, and getting the clock set is not very easy as the buttons are not very responsive to your touch. For the price, it is what you get for that price. If I could have seen the actual size, I would not have purchased it."
1,"No game, only headset!!!!!","I pre-ordered this game like everyone else cause I was going to get a cool free headset with the game, and that was all that was delivered to my home! No game, just a ""free"" $50 headset.You know that excited feeling when you get something that you've been waiting for, for a very long time, and you see it on your doorstep? Well that was ruined for me when I could'nt find the game that I ordered in its box. It only made it worse that they made the headset box look exactly like the actual battlefield 2 box.I do remember that when I pushed the pre-order button it said ""battlefied 2 (with) pre-order bonus"", not some confusing premotional code and shopping cart thing.Amazon should act fast with this mistake, or there's going to be A LOT of angry gamers out there."
1,NO GAME ONLY A STUPID HEADSET,"I am as pissed as everyone else. I just assumed the game would be coming. Today I realized it wasn't, and I got screwed by AMAZON. NO LUBE WHAT SO EVER! Thanx for screwing AMAZON hurts real good."
1,HP Camera case,"I do not like this camera case. It is supposedly a magnetic closure, but the magnet does not hold, and I've had the camera fall out on me a couple of times. Now I prefer to carry my camera in my purse."
4,Straps don't slip if you follow the directions.,"I have owned these straps for over 5 years for dawn patrol surf trips ranging from a 5 minute drive to over 60 minutes on the freeway.This works on any car and can carry multiple 9' longboards side by side.The straps are probably the most misunderstood part of this rack.The straps have a locking D ring which can slip unless you follow the manufacturers directions.Basically, you have to cinch the straps tight (I lean back and use body weight while I stand outside the car). The critical part that most people don't understand is that you then need to loop the strap back into the D ring hole and tie off the end.When done properly, it is more secure than any other soft rack, even the ones with the metal clamps.BOTTOM LINE: Tie off the ends of the strap in the D ring and this rack is great!"
3,Quick Look,"This is not a book for beginners who want to learn MATLAB or GUI. If you already know how to run MATLAB and know some GUI, then you may find this book useful. It will improve your graph and GUI skill. If you have no knowledge on how GUI is created, this is not a book for you."
2,Way way too short for the price,This 2 disc DVD set contained only 2 short episodes of mr Rogers on them. 1 episode per disc. For $30 I think that is a rip off!! They should combine episodes or lower the price significantly. The shows are great but again there should be multiple shows per disc considering the length of the programs.
2,Eh....,Not the best ELP live disc. I prefer Live at the Royal Albert Hall or Live at Montreaux. This is cool to see them in their early days but the sound and production is just not that great.
1,Unspeakably bad,"The trailer makes this movie seem like it might have some potential. It doesn't.Absolutely nothing in this movie makes sense. Which, apparently, is the point, as spoken by the main character in the first few minutes.Watch the movie, only to be able to say you've survived the sheer stupidity of it."
3,Had potential,"I tend to be more forgiving of movies that many folks. So, I was not worried about some of the negative reviews since I've enjoyed some mindless fare in the past.This one, I'm afraid was a bit lacking, as others have said. The audience watching the tire didn't seem to add much. The explanation at the beginning that some of the best things to happen in cinema have 'no reason' was fine for explaining 'why does a tire come alive?' but not for explaining what the point of the movie was. The only point I could find was that the film makers wanted to see if a) they could make a tire seem alive, b) they could shoot any good camera angles, c) they could actually sell this piece of homework.The Good:They did a great job in making the tire seem alive and not just rolled into frame. This is why I say it could have been so much better if the story had been better or made any real sense."
2,Rubber Kills!,"For many years, I thought that rubber was supposed to be used for good. I thought that using rubber was a good way to keep from getting STD's. Now, after seeing the movie Rubber, I see that rubber can also be very bad. Rubber is an original film. However, being original doesn't always mean it's entertaining. Whenever someones head isn't exploding onscreen, Rubber is excruciatingly boring. The story and the script are both pretty bad, as are a lot of the characters. Oh, but Rubber does have gore. If 1981's Scanners was the Citizen Cane of head explosion movies, then Rubber is the Gone With The Wind of head explosion movies. There is also a fairly cool and scary aftermath scene that shows a bunch of headless corpses strewn out on the streets, in stores, and houses. If only Rubber would have had more scenes like that. If only."
2,Shocked people liked this at all...,"Possibly the dumbest movie ever. If it were made by creative people it would have an awesomely twisted ending that would have saved and justified it's absurdity... instead it just dumps you like a bad date. Did I mention that date was long, boring and confusing?"
3,progressive vitamin dispenser,"the container is too small for larger pills. my old one was 6"" tall and I didn't have to refill it so often. also the sections should be fully open at the top and the hole should be at the side of the lid."
1,worthless,Medium to large vitamins do NOT come out the holes...they're much too small. What a waste of a few bucks.
3,It Wouldn't Take Much To Make This Work - Do It Yourself,"The swiveling lid binds with time, as it picks up fine dust from the vitamins within. The dispensing hole is way too small to allow the pills to fall out. First thing you must do is enlarge the hole - double or triple size. You can't make it too large. The cap needs a flange to make it more easily removeable. You must grab and pry the lid off now when it's time to refill a column. It works, and I haven't found one better, so you're stuck with this one. Given a choice to buy it or not, I'd buy it again until a better design comes out. One good thing about this one is each section holds many pills - in contrast to most others. This is still my favorite."
2,holes not big enough for gel capsules,"too hard to get flax seed oil capsules out, also smaller than my last one. i would not recommend it"
5,Because we can all learn a lot from Bill Porter,"Whatever you think about the hand that life has dealt you, think again. Consider what the experience of someone who had so much stacked against them can teach you - about life, challenges and most of all, about yourself. Wonderful."
2,"Shelly, get off the stage...","Bill Porter's story was inspirational enough for me to visit his web site and buy from him. His life merits recognition, not just because he overcame the obstacles of his disability, but even more for his humble view of his own remarkable achievements. Bill's story is even more compelling when compared to the author's life history. The book suggests author Shelly Brady is looking for money and fame in the name of a truly great individual. She even includes letters sent to Bill from people who have seen the 20/20 segment featuring Bill which refer to Shelly as an ""angel."" ... All I wanted from the book was inspiration from Bill. ... The two great things I got from the book were Bill's web site address ... and a glimps of this great man."
3,disappointing,"I really thought this book was just okay. It started out to be very good but then got to be boring. At first the story seemed to be about Jenny and Trell. Later Trell was a very small part. Travis seemed to take over. There was a lot going on, but it just stopped being interesting. I would like to read about Cassandra or Dillon. I liked Larkspur very much and was a little disappointed with this."
5,Wonderful Book,"I love this book. It was funny, touching and heartwarming. It also has excitement and danger mixed in. This book shows that women, if they have enough determination and grit, can survive anything."
1,Really sick characters,"A view into the minds of two extremely preverted people, this is the story of a masocist and a sadist. Did I really want to know their thoughts, fantasies or actions? These were people I wouldn't have a cup of coffee with in a million years. Did I already know that these people look and for the msot part act like normal people? You bet.So, why, I kept asking myself, did the author write this book? Certainly, they weren't people you wanted hanging around your subconscious for very long, let along having to think of them intimately all the time you were writing. Maybe he was exorcising his own personal demons - I don't know.Maybe it's my own brand of voyerism that made me finish the novel, but I'll be more careful next time one of his books comes my way."
4,Here Comes The Prophet,"Anyone thinking on buying an album of Luca Turilli must hear Rhapsody first, if you like Rhapsody, there's almost a 100% chance that you will like both of the albums of Luca Turilli. This last album, ""Prophet of the Last Eclipse"", I found it superior that ""King of the Northic Twilight"". Besides the usual Rhapsody's type of symphonic metal sound, it has a little of techno involved, giving that futuristic sound that the band wanted to provide. A good album; however, some of Rhapsoy's materials (specially the first three Rhapsody albums[""Legendary Tales"", ""Symphony of the Enchanted Lands"", ""Dawn of Victory""]) are superior to both of the Luca Turilli's albums."
3,Space Prophecies,"If you like accordion mixed with gypsy-sounding power metal, this has at least one track to your liking. This is symphonic power metal. Sounds like Rhapsody but less thrashy and the strings are replaced with a lot of spacy keyboards. Its some really nice song writing and the soundscape of weird space and future notes is really fun. Olaf Hayer sings really well on this. Luca Turilli is an amazing guitarist/composer, but he sure watch too much sci-fi :)"
4,Big and Accurate clock,"Really like this big clock. After 1 month since first set,it appears to be within seconds accurate still. The back hassettings for DST with Old, New, or Off switch. This morningafter clocks went back, it's still right on.I wanted a silent clock without ticking, and thought without asecond hand (as this one is) it would be quiet. This one doestick, and if the room where the clock is located is very quiet,a light ticking sound can be heard."
1,It really seemed like a good idea at the time !!!!!,IF you like John Candy DO NOT get this movie. He was not in it much and he is a young kid at the time of this movie. IT WAS REALLY BAD!!!!
3,Good drive-in comedy,"I bought this movie as part of a 50-movies (on 13 DVD's) package they sell for 31$ at a local bookstore so I wasn't really expecting anything. As the title says this is a good drive-in comedy, but don't get fooled by the fact that there's John Candy in the credits, we see him only toward the end and he says only about 10 lines of text. Isaac Hayes have a more prominent role but it's still a Anthony Newley movie, he's somewhat funny. The movie is about a guy, Sweeney (played by Anthony Newley) who like to use practical jokes to solve everyday problems like how to keep your mistress away in a log cabin for a few days. The beginning is a bit slow but there's a funny ending."
1,Fraud,DO NOT BUY THIS. The cover of the package is fraudulent. John Candy is NOT a major character in this movie. This movie is some cheap independent made movie full of cheap bathroom humor (if you can call it humor). We turned this movie off 10-15 minutes into it and Candy had NOT made an appearance yet. His name appeared in the end of the cast credits.
1,Can't get much worse than this bomb of a movie so slow and boring,This would easily make the top 100 worst movies made of all time list even maybe the top 10 so bad and boring not one bit funny just boring crap pure garbage and they should delete the master tape and pretend this stinker never got made
1,the T got problems,"shortly after 40 days, my T started to stylus calabrition shifts when i slide the unit open.Shipped it back for repair, and a week after repair it started the same problem.Palm sent a refurb in exchange, but the replacement unit would registered a stylus press when the lower part of the unit is twisted slighly.The refurb unit is going back, and plam is sending anther refurb.A friend purchased a New T, and the unit have calabration problems right out of the box.I'm giving up on palm.I recommend looking at another manufacture."
4,Osmonds outstanding as they always are,"The Osmonds just keep getting better & better. The whole family put on an Aweaome performance. As they did when I was a teenager. But I think they even sound better then ever. It brought back a lot of old good memories. And I still remembered the words as they were singing.50 years later I consider the Osmonds still number 1. I would recommend this to anyone, who is an Osmond fan."
1,Boring!,"I like the Osmond brothers without Jimmy. In my opinion he should not be singing lead. His voice is no where as good as Merrill, Wayne, Jay or Donny. The brothers should be singing more than they do."
5,The Osmonds 50th Live in Las Vegas Reunion Concert,"I purchased two, one for myself and one for my daughter. We have enjoyed watching this DVD very much. The music is great, sound great and the entire DVD was great entertainment. I would buy it again in a heartbeat."
1,My daughter hated it,My daughter was never interested in listening to this. Played it once and its been in its case ever since.
3,Too abstract,"The book is extewemely abstract. Almost no numerical examples. Very difficult to read and understand. Positive points: Cover the subject well. While I'm study, I keep ""google"" on in my computerand I search for online examples in order to understand what the book is talking about."
1,Not for undergrads!,"I have a really difficult time with this book and often find myself having to do tons of outside research to comprehend the material. The sections are horribly short, genereally 2-3 pages which means there's no room for examples. Also, there are no answers in the back which leaves me wondering if I've screwed up somehow. This book really isn't meant for undergraduates. It's difficult to understand and too brief. It could use many more examples. If you've got a course in optimization, pray for a different book!"
1,Not For Undergraduates,"This book should not be used to teach an Introduction to Optimization at the undergraduate level. It is being done so at my school, and it is driving the undergraduate students crazy because they do not understand the book, the notation also is causing problems. If you are new to the subject area, and do not have an advanced math background(more than college) try looking elsewhere."
2,Horrible production ruins a potentially good album,"The production quality on this album is horrendous.. It's hard for me to believe it was meant to be this way.. The bass is tuned in such a way that this album is almost painful to listen to. This was an impulse buy for me. I had never heard anything but Pop! before. I hated this album, but it did get me to go check out some of the other albums.. their self-titled album, in particular, quite surprised me in how good it was. Go buy some other Erasure album, not this one."
4,This is worth a listen if you like Erasure,"I love Catch 22 and Here in My Heart the most from this album. Freedom & Alien are also a good listen but I can't relate as much to the lyrics. Few of the other songs are also worth putting on your iPod to if you call yourself an Erasure fan. I had every one of their CDs except for this one because I was discouraged by the critics when this album came out over 10 years ago. I loved Cowboy and this album is not even close to the quality of the work on that album. Other People's Songs, Nightbird and the last 2 albums have much more songs that are catchy. But I'm glad I have this album also because I like Catch 22 that much and I like hearing all of Vince & Andy's work."
1,Baffling!!,"WSS is as American as apple pie, in it's own way, so why, why, why use European opera singers for, what should be a landmark recording? Not only distracting, to have to listen to Tony with an Italian accent, but downright annoying. Why couldn't they have enlisted the thousands of American and Latino artists that would have suited this project so much better. It's not as though they even used big names for the recording,ie: the complete recording a while back with Kiri Te Kanawa and Jose Careras had their names to recommend it, and it was produced by Bernstein, but this recording has nothing to recommend.Stick to the original cast for the best recording. There is also a recording by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra that is pretty good, aside from a bit of over-acting by some ensemble members, but the leads are wonderful.And the film soundtrack has it's own merits, but this is a major mistake. Goes into the ""what were they thinking?"" file."
1,Every FRD book is great except this one!!!,"Do not buy this book for your kids, unless you live in an Amish community or somewhere where you know and trust absolutely everyone. The girls befriend an elderly single man and it's quite quaint and nice if it weren't for the horrible reality of our world today. The girls are rewarded and rejoice in befriending a strange man, alone, with no adults present. It is sweet and naive story, a dangerous lesson in our times."
1,Very disappointing,"I was extremely disappointed with this novel, especially after reading all the good reviews it received here. Although the topic was original, it lacked creativity and exploration of human feelings. The author relied heavily on the conversations, and even so, these were very brief. Unfortunately, I absorbed nothing out of this novel, and not once did I feel connected with the protagonist. Even now, I really don't believe this captured ""the essence of the thing."""
4,day at the beach,"I bought it for an office desk decoration/adult ""toy"" type thing.It makes a good addition to your space if you are in love with the beach and can't be there every day."
4,"Nice, thoughtful music","Sometimes adding the right amount of melodic, accessible material to the right amount of discordance results in something that is both interesting and music - that's the case here. Experimental, off-kilter elements, at certain moments quite discordant, with added static and little background noises throughout, never quite drown out underlying wistful melodies, adding up to a thoughtful, reflective listen. It comes across as mellow, at times almost sentimental, without becoming muzak, and at the same time disruptive without becoming noise. Reminiscent of a more laid back Tortoise in places."
2,Not that erotic at all,"This book is deemed an erotic novel right on the cover (making me slightly embarassed while purchasing) but much to my surprise, it really wasn't all that! The author does a nice job of laying out the emotional depth of Gabriel but the sex is mostly very clinical and not much of it at that. Some authors do a poor job of characterization but good eroticism (i.e., Thea Devine, the master of stupid dialogue and baffling characters) and some like Ms. Schone seem to be the opposite. I know her novels are meant to have a dark, hardcore edge but the problem is that she just doesn't do it that well, at least in this book. So not worth the $15 dollars!!"
1,Completely Lacks Taste,"This album is perhaps the most awful CD I have ever seen released in the entire history of the CD industry. The songs are BORING and they make you want to throw something hard against the radio that is playing one of his songs. His voice is extremely annoying which makes it vry hard for people to pay attention to it and listen to the lyrics. It is still obscure to me the reasons why he got a Grammy in the first place, if he got one, everyone should get one. This is why I say it deserved two enthusiastic thumbs down!"
2,Dissapointing.,"I heard ""Enamorado Por Primera Vez,"" liked the sound, and bought the album. I was dissapointed by the rest of the songs. Not the same caliber. This guy's got talent, but one-hit per album doesn't work for me..."
2,Almost Accurate,"This was my first Stabila torpedo level and got it because of the angle finder and magnetic hold. Unfortunately the center vial came out of level. Its not like it can get banged out of wack. It was made this way. You can actually see that it looks cocked by 1 degree off. It even contradicts itself not to mention my other levels. This particular level was a pretty neat idea, too bad the quality control was lacking. 2 vials ok = 2 stars."
1,Really ??,"Do not even think about purchasing this vacuum... It is very weak in power. I wanted to use it to vacuum up small pine from my pets cage, and it wouldnt even pick it up on full charge, the charge doesnt last long and it is very noisy. I would NOT recommend this for anyone. If i could give it ZERO stars. i would."
3,loud,it is loud and the opening is too small to handle life cerealpositive sidebattery lasts a long time
4,Hoover hand vac,"The vacuum was stronger than most hand held vacuums I have used. I have a bulldog who leaves cookie crumbs, so I bought it to clean up after him. Its a little noisy, but then I suppose that has to do with the fact that it seems powerful. :) I'd recommend the product."
5,housekeeping,item is very good for what i use it for and that is to remove bugs from wall lights in a large facility---the first one i purchased came with an extension piece ---i carry it from light to light---does the job---not having to plug in from plug to plug as i move.con----as with all battery items ---it usually goes bad in about 18 months---
3,Not as Great as I'd Hoped,"This hand vac does a good job of picking up debris, however it's quite loud. The high pitch really hurts my ears. The ""on"" button has to be held down with my thumb in order to keep the vacuum on. I have problems with my hands so it makes the unit very uncomfortable for me to use since I can't flip a switch and have the vac stay on until I'm finished vacuuming.."
2,lost suction,"The wet/dry vac performed great the first couple of weeks. After that it seemed to lose suction, even after being fully charged. Not enough power to warrant the extra space in my small utility room."
2,Not what I expected,"For a Hoover product this is lesser than you would expect especially, the suction is poor. Sometimes you literally have to put the dirt closer to the mouth of the vacuum to suck this in...I am certainly not too thrilled."
3,"very small opening, constantly needs unjamming","the opening is only about two inches. so if you are only vacuuming sand, dry food or kitty litter, but if you try anything else like large dustbunnies etc..you will have to keep stopping and cleaning it out."
5,Works excellent,it picks up everything! I mainly use it to pick up hairs in the bathroom and it is working very great! very satisfied with the product!
3,dust holder part is awkward,When using the vacuum it works well but when emptying it it is awkward to not dump the dirt out of the in nozzle before you get it over the garbage.
1,This is as bad as it gets,"When I first received the Hoover S1120 I thought it was a defective product because before I even tried using it I could not pull the dirt cup apart from the handle. I called the number on the booklet and they told me to return it to Amazon, as I did. I received a replacement. With great effort I managed to pull it apart just to see if I could and then tried using it. The dirt doesn't collect in the cup but goes into the filter which, at least for me, has been almost impossible to remove and clean. There is a rubber gasket that must be removed to get to the filter. Once I removed it, I couldn't get it back on. At this time,I gave up. It cost only $32. so I will charge it to Experience."
2,Barely gets anything,"Ive tried it on multiple surfaces, the only way to get any suction seems to be in putting it ona flat surface and creating a suction cup kinda deal. Otherwise and even with that its fairly useless, gets like 10% of the dirt."
3,"Works good, hard to plug into charger.","After a couple of months of use, on dry pickups only, we have found this vacuum to be quite satisfactory. It is kind of noisey, but has good suction, and is easy to use and clean. Have not used it for wet pickup. The one problem we have encountered, is that it is difficult to get it properly seated into the charging stand, for recharge. The small plug/socket combination used to charge just doesn't mate properly every time, and it is not possible to tell when it is in the stand, but not charging. This has resulted in picking up the vacuum to use, and batteries are low or dead. It either needs a charging indicator, or a better type of connection. I think this is a fairly serious problem, so only three stars. Other than this, it would have been five stars. As far as how long the batteries last, I'll have to use it longer to find this out."
2,Typical Made in China cheap look./,I have used Hoover cleaners for years and their plastic quality and durability was excellent. It is because they were truly American. This hand held version looks typical of other Made in China generic products with just a brand name on. The vacuum cleaner works fine but the fact that is rechargeable makes me believe that through various charges the battery's life and capacity will degrade.Plus to clean car seats it is not good at all.
3,"Good, while it lasted...","This thing was good, but not great. Great value, got a lot of use out of it. Worked very well when kids spilled a cup of something. Would have given it 4 stars had it lasted longer. In the end the ""Dirt Cup"" (the large blue see though plastic piece) broke at the bottom. Now the dirt cup falls off & the product cannot be used. Replacement part is $6, plus another $6 shipping. Not worth paying 50% of purchase price to fix. I will look for a different product to replace this one. This lasted us about 6 months."
5,Parts for grill,Received the burner replacement parts for my grill in a very short period of time.The price was very reasonable. Instillation was easy and the grill works great now.
1,The friendly ghost was scarier,"Sorry true haunting ghost story fans out there, this book ain'tIT! Author uses a very dumbing down writing approach, whichmakes you feel like a complete idiot for believing this stuffin the first place. The scariest thing about this book is thefact that somebody actually printed it. Save your money!"
2,Not appropriate if you're not Christian,"This is a beautiful book, well illustrated, but in spite of acknowledging at the beginning that the story of Noah & the Ark is told in many cultures, at the very end of the book, the author slips in Christian messaging and New Testament references. The book would have been entirely complete withouth this. I had bought this book for a young Jewish child and returned it because it's inappropriate in that context."
3,"Moderately Fun, Not a Game We Go Back to Often","We've had this for awhile but seem to only play it occasionally. It is moderately fun but has some issues while playing it.The goal is to move around a board collecting colored Zoob pieces to ultimately create a specific design that is only on your card. Once you collect all the pieces you'll need, you race to the middle of the board and try to build your Zoob creation before your opponent gets their pieces and builds theirs.Some of the problems are that you might often get stuck on the same color and not getting near the color that you need. Kids get frustrated with this quickly. Also, younger kids have trouble sometimes seeing the spacial relationship of the pieces and how they go together, even though the card is clearly illustrated.A pretty good game but not a favorite at our house by any means."
5,Toolbox of requirements gathering and recording techniques,"As an enterprise architect, I spend a lot of time working on the early stages of projects. Occasionally I'll nee to step into the role of a requirements analyst, particularly for more technical systems. This book is an excellent source of techniques for gathering and recording requirements. At project initiation, I'll use it to determine the set of artifacts needed for the particular system I'm working on. Great reference work."
5,Great reference!,"I find my copy of the Software Req Memory Jogger absolutely invaluable, it's effectively a complete software requirements course in a little book! I use it all the time and it has helped considerably when needing focus and/or guidance on my tasks."
2,It's really a full text in microscopic print,"Another reviewer said this:""What ""Memory Jogger"" delivered was a good basic text on the requirements process presented in a virtually unusable format.""Amen to that. This thing is not portable as the moiker 'memory jogger' implies; and because rthe print is so small, it's very difficult to use at your desk.What's more, I bought mine from Amazon, and they've cleverly (read intentionally and deceivingly) excluded themselves from receiving seller feedback. When I bought my copy, there were no dimensions provided for the book. This meant there was no way for me to determine that it wasn't a reasonably sized, pamphlet-style book.I didn't want to return it (it has useful information), but until I remembered to do this review, I had no way to complain about how misleading the portrayal of this book is."
5,super strong magnets,The magnets on this thing are pretty darn strong. The bubbles are easy to see. I've dropped this thing from up to 30 feet in the air several times and it's still level. Best torpedo level on the market.
4,ipod Armband is just that. And that's enough.,"This product works just as you would expect. It's comfortable and stylish, just what you care about for the gym or jog around the lake. Aren't you glad you have not upgraded your iPod yet?"
1,Buyer Beware,"When I purchase this book as NEW, I never knew I'd be receiving a used book 3.5 weeks after ordering and paid almost $40! Yes, foolish of me, I admit. There are more 'recipes' thank what I hought would be a lovely history of caviar. Furthermore, the appearance of the book online is deceiving. This is a very small book (7 3/4"" x 7 3/4"") and only 64 pages. Not even worthy of a coffee table book. Had I researched further, I could have heeded my own advice!"
5,Large Enough to Fit Most Electronic Components,"PROS1) This will fit almost all computer components, except the motherboard.CONS1) These bags have no seals, so you will need to use some tape if you want to keep your components inside the bag."
2,Why 1960's!!??,"OK, I get that we don't know much about Purcell, but we do know about his music; wonderful and filled with emotion. So why not just do the film in the context of Purcell's time and keep it there? The switching to the 1960's is annoying and not needed. A TV version, which I taped some time ago, had edited out all of the 1960's angst. So when I got the CD I was very disappointed with these 1960's interruptions. At the time, the description of the CD was lacking this important fact! So I still use the old TV taped version when I want to see this film. You've heard of the ""who dun it"" type of film? This could be called ""why'd they do that?"""
1,Stuck in a Time Warp,"Since not much is known about Henry Purcell's life, the DVD focuses on the rantings of a writer/actor seeking to portray the England of Purcell's time. Unfortunately, the scenes jump from the late 1960's to the 1600's and back again in a distracting manner. A lot of time is wasted on soap box monologues that have nothing to do with Purcell, or the England of his day. The DVD is a patchwork of dramatic scenes leading to the dramatist's hoped-for goal. In retrospect, this type of filming has become cliche."
1,Lazy,"As a Philadelphian, I was excited to read this book, a mystery seeped in Philadelphia's corrupt politics by a local journalist. This didn't cut it. For all its mentions of locale, this book had no sense of place. It could have taken place in Cleveland.The characters had no heart. The plot limped along thanks to a seemingly endless series of convenient coincidences, constantly painting itself into a corner and suddenly finding a secret trap door. After all that, the ending was a rushed little chapter tacked on without tying up half the loose ends. It was like author Bill Kent just got sick of writing the thing and stopped. Which is pretty much how I felt reading it.If visiting Philly by book, do yourself a favor and read all three of Steve Lopez's novels instead. Heck, read W.C Fields's tomb stone."
1,A waste of time,"Honestly, the biggest mystery with this book is how it got published. The author is a newspaper journalist, but he's thrown all his training out the window for this book as it meanders around, seemingly pointlessly, for page after page after dreary page.Maybe if I'd finished it I would have got the point. I didn't."
1,Uneven bottom after seasoning!,"I too saw the good reviews and bought one. I followed the seasoning instructions that came with the wok to the letter, boiling the water in the pan, scrubbing the whole pan, and seasoning...etc. But I notice the bottom of the pan starts to get uneven, it does not lay flat on my ceramic stove top, so it won't transfer heat evenly. I then tried scramble eggs with my seasoned pan, and because it's my first use, I really just put quite a bit of oil in it, but the scramble eggs still sticks badly, and as I tried to clean off the sticking food on the pan, the previously seasoned layer flakes off from the bottom of the pan. This pan gets uneven bottom after proper seasoning, even with oil, still sticks badly. I have to return this pan, because this is just not a quality pan I have expected with this purchased. What else I can do with the pan?!"
3,not bad,"It's sturdy, and healthy. But it's just too hard to keep the seasoning. I seasoned it in oven and on oven-top, but both are not very good. The first few days after I seasoned it, it keeps non-stick. But the seasoning easily come off even I use bamboo turner and only wash it with water. Then it becomes stick. I have seasoned it for three times, but now I don't want to any more, it's a lot of work. It also gets rusted. So now every time after use, I put a little oil on it and wipe with a tissue, so it doesn't get rusted now. But I think it's a waste of time to do all this. I guess I'll get a non-stick wok soon, if I can find some coating that's not very unhealthy."
5,The best of Bette,"I'm traditiionally not a Bette Davis fan but this film is so entertaining! Bette plays a selfish, self centered and arrogant woman who is also vain and conceited- very few admirable qualities. After contracting a very serious illness that dramatically alters her very beautiful appearance and the return of Mr. Skeffington from W.W. 11 Fanny Skeffington dramatically changes- for the better. She finally understands the true meaning of love and life."
5,Thats my Bette,"Bette Davis is wonderfully obnoxious in this movie. Bette, plays a woman obsessed with beauty and attention, it takes you through her journey lasting a lifetime, only to discover in the end that ""a woman is only beautiful when she is loved"" Highly recommended for any classic movie or Bette Davis fan. Two thumbs up!"
5,Mr. Skeffington,Mr. Skeffington is truly one of the many great movies made in the 1940s. A morality play at its best!
4,Grand entertainment,"A beautiful film with an extraordinary score by Franz Waxman, composer of ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""A Place in the Sun"" and ""Peyton Place"". The score is now available in an outstanding new digital recording via the Marco Polo label. Order it from Amazon.com!!!!"
5,A Must on Nodes!,"I am not a professional astrologer, but have had readings done by them, and have wondered how they knew things about #1) Nodes in general, as there are few books that even touch on the subject; and #2) where info on reincarnation in astrology was found. This book covers both subjects and helped me understand myself and others much, much better. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in these subjects and the fact that it is exceptionally easy to read and understand is a BIG plus!"
3,Needs Revision,"I agree with a previous reviewer: this book, published in 1975, needs serious updating. While the information in it is not ""bad"" or inaccurate per se, it often seems based on unsubstantiated evidence, or worse, on outdated assumptions or information, and for anyone who has a serious interest into the ""why"" and ""how"" of astrology, and those who are relatively well read in psychology, astronomy, or any of the relevant other exoteric sciences, this book barely makes the cut.This book is not a bad beginning, and reasonably good if you know how to extract the nuggets scattered throughout. Just don't get your expectations up too high!"
5,A Must Have!,This set is a Must Have for any Joan Crawford fan. I am beyond happy with this purchase! I highly recommend this boxed set to any Joan fan.
4,Prompt and good service,"The package arrived in good time. The box was frayed at the corners, probably because of its long voyage from the US to Hong Kong."
2,NOT for TRUE Joan Crawford fans!,"This set of four Joan Crawford movies is definitely NOT for the true Joan Crawford fan. Why? Because, if you ARE a true Joan Crawford fan, you ALREADY OWN these films on DVD! They've been available for YEARS! Where is ""Autumn Leaves""? Where is ""Harriet Craig""? Where is ""The Last of Mrs. Cheyney""? Where is a proper release of ""Sudden Fear""? There, I just named four films that would make a great Joan Crawford DVD set. Now, would someone PLEASE pass that on to whoever it is that is so desperate to get more of our money?!!"
1,an enforcement of stereotypes,"As a writer, Robert Kaplan rates five stars; as an analyst, zero. Balkan Ghosts enforces the West's belief that mass-murder in the Balkans is a tradition, and that this makes the groups there somehow unique in world history. This is a crock, and incredibly unfair to all sides. It is an increasingly common trend for writers to use the Balkans to flex hithero unseen intellectual muscle by quoting West, Reed, and the Mountain Wreath. Writers now do this to gloss over their lack of understanding of the region. Kaplan does this throughout, and he paints a picture of those in the Balkans as animals. Balkan Ghosts should not be included in any ""shopping list"" of scholarly works. Kaplan's other works are worthwhile, but this one is NOT."
4,Good journalism makes everybody mad,"I'm pleased that so many people take exception to this book. Good journalism is always biased: a writer is not an automaton, but a real person who brings his own belief system to the work at hand.Not surprisingly, this annoys a lot of people. Tough. The journalist has as much right to his opinion as the reviewer has to his. Let's face it: we're all biased. We all think 'unbiased' means 'the writer sees things exactly as I do'.We also all tend to conveniently ignore facts which don't fit in our view of things. The Serb ignores reports of Kosovar women nailed to barn walls and gang-raped to death; the Kosovar ignores reports of entire Serb villages massacred and plowed under. Extreme examples, but on a smaller scale we are *all like that*.The point is, condemning a reporter for being biased is the pot calling the kettle black. If we weren't biased, we wouldn't write reviews."
2,Not what I expected,"After reading the book, I was disapointed that it did not contain more ""how to"" flintknapping info.The author has written an excellent book on flint knapping methods.This book was very ' folksy' With too many anecdotal stories about knap-ins, and the modern flint knapping world,with almost no methods on flintknapping.Again ,not what I expected, and I wish I could have read my own review, as I would not have purchased the book.I gave the book a two star rating only for the photos of knapped peices."
4,A great childrens book,This book is brightly illustrated and is worded so that even the youngest readers can enjoy it. Overall a great kids book!
1,Killer recipes,I bought this as a present for a friend who is not a cook. She has to prepare food for her aging parents and I thought this would be perfect for her. Not! Each recipe is way overloaded with sodium Would have killed her parents and certainly not good for anyone else either.
1,fooled,"I thought I was buying the original with joe baker, but instead recieved a copy of the new one starring The Rock. I am pissed. Their description is a lie. I heard the original is awesome, but now I dont know how I'm going to find a copy of it. And now I have 2 copies of the stupid one with the Rock."
5,Angels with a Difference,"The name of this oracle deck might mislead some people: it has nothing to do with a south asian or Hindu theme. In fact, for those who like Christian Byzantine art, similar to Greek Orthodox icons, this deck will be very appealing. Each angel is assigned a name (drawn from Jewish, Christian, or Gnostic mythology) and an oracular role/meaning, and each stands alone on their respective card, in all their glory. The images have a deliberate, nearly ""two-dimensional"" quality about them, as the art style requires. Each combines pastel shades and warm golden glows, as befits these wondrous messengers from another plane of existence. This is an Angel deck that draws on an ancient tradition, and to my eye, is exceptionally beautiful! -A good bet for card readers AND collectors."
3,Learn Needle Tatting -- Step-by-Step,The presentation of pictures which accompanied the instructions are very clear. The written instructions are clear and straight forward. I would recommend this book to anyone.
4,Fantastic 1st Person Narrative!,"Quarrington's Whale Music is as decadent and sincere as its main character. A touching story doused in an absurd fondue of drug abuse, money, rock and roll, and agoraphobia. Track this one down!"
3,A little early?!,"Why the AFI choosed to give Jack Lemmon this award so early is a mystery to me, but even so: he richly deserved it. A profilic actor over the years, in comedy as well in drama, Lemmon has brought warmth and humor to the silver screen. This tape is mildly entertaining, mainly because it is to contemporary for my taste, but it does offer some fun once in a while and if you like Lemmon, it's a must."
4,A good DVD for AYAOTD fans,"A great completion to the episode collection of ""Are You Afraid of The Dark?"". Contains at least some very awesome episodes, particularly The Tale of The Silver Sight, The Last Dance, and The Many Faces. The only downfall to this product is that in The Night Nurse, the people's voices go out of sync during the last half of the episode. Other than that, this DVD is great and is a must have for any fan of the show!"
5,Their best effort yet!,"Not only great musicians, but also great guys if you ever get a chance to meet or talk to them at one of their shows! Warrel Dane continues to set the standard for metal vocalists that actually ""sing"" and Jeff Loomis further cements his status as one of the best guitarists in any genre. ""Psalm of Lydia"" is a delight for guitar fans, as Loomis and new guitarist Steve Smyth trade ferocious leads over an awesome riff, and the title track displays the incredible drumming of Van Williams. Exceptional production by Andy Sneap really helps to show the dynamics of the band in full, so grab this CD now!"
3,hrmph,"Real short and sweet, they sound like Iron Maiden. If you like Eddie, then you'll like this. They aren't an ""instant classic"" like their subjective fans like to say."
4,Talented!!!,The lyrics on this album are really good and the production is excellent. This is jazzy R&B; at it's best. As a follow up from his first album(I just wanna sing) this doesn't fall far from it and keeps up the good work.I recommend this album to people looking for some relaxing R&B...and; I recommend the rap group the Roots on a side not because if you like this album I am pretty sure you will like the new one Phrenology(something like that). Peace out folks!!!
2,Mainstream R&B dressed up with thrift shop clothes,"Everyone is ""neo-soul"" these days if they aren't in a 3 to 4 member group that dresses alike, dances in unison and doesn't play an instrument. Please, Musiq is no more ""neo-soul"" than Ja Rule is. Other artists such Maxwell, D'angelo, and Bilal who are placed under the ""neo-soul"" umbrella are much better at it than Musiq is. Don't let some beads, baggy pants and a skull cap fool you. His ""speak-singing (as another reviewer called it)"" is irritating as all get out. I hated it the first time around, but I'm a glutton and gave him another chance. Actually, the disc isn't terrible and I might have liked it more, if it had have been marketed differently, trimmed by about 5 songs and less of the ""speak-singing"" and more real singing."
1,"HE MUST BE ""HALFCRAZY""","Musiq is such a phony.Come on,dude comes out on the scene with faux-""boho"" style and tagging alongside The Roots and Erykah Badu all while his music is the same sounding R&B mush that dominates urban radio.Add to that,corny lyrics and bad singing and then you got Musiq!!! ""Juslisen"" is 'jusbad"" if you know what I mean.Musiq needs to go back to Philly and maybe get a 9 to 5 at a cleaners or maybe he can hone his musical skills 'cause it's just not working! Nobody said it and it had to be said!"
5,GOIN' HALF CRAZY OVER THIS CD!!!!!!!,"My goodness. I am really feeling this new Musiq CD. It is off of the hook. Musiq's debut can certainly not touch Justlisten.The songs have great beats that you can definitly nod your head to, and I love his lyrics. I'm sorry, I am rambling on but I am in love with Musiq and he is an excellent live performer also.All of the songs are hot and I can't get enough of them.Go out and check this album out you will not be disappointed.MUSIQ, U GO BOY!! U HAVE TRUE TALENT:)"
5,Wonderful follow-up!,"Classic. Vintage. The essence of ""Neo-Soul"": the re-emergence of the Soul music of old. I have been so pleased with Musiq. He totally lives up to what music needs to return to these days- musicianship, diversity and bold internal creativity. I bought it the day it came out and I am eagerly anticipating the release of his new one in December. He is to be commended, saluted and praised for his fine work as a true artist. Thank you Musiq and may God continue to pour out of you!!!"
3,"Impressive, but not quite my cup of tea","Brit Cult was impressive, but not quite my cup of tea. I had hoped it would be an all-around Anglophile guide covering the past 30 years of British culture and society. What it does do (and does so very well) is talk about musical and artistic trends in the U.K. during that period. Thus we hear about all the many breakout trends in music that followed punk, and even the drug scene that accompanied it (3 pages on Ecstasy alone). There are, however, no entries for ""Falklands,"" ""Margaret Thatcher,"" or ""Poll Tax.""If you already have a pretty good idea of what recent British pop music, art and literature is like, this book is a good investment. If not, it may be of limited usefulness."
4,Excellent One Disc Compilation,"For someone on a budget who is interested in the music of this legendary British Blues Band, look no further than this single disc album. The sound and track selection here are very good. Anyone interested in the blues needs to have at least one Savoy Brown album in their collection and you can't go wrong here. But, for those of you who have a few extra dollars around, I strongly suggest passing on this single disc release and opt for the 2 disc set ""The Savoy Brown Collection (Chronicles Series)"" on the Polydor label. ""The Savoy Brown Collection"" boasts 29 tracks an is more comprehensive than this release. It also contains an extensive booklet with excellent liner notes. Go zShops and you can pick up the 2 cd set for a very reasonable price. If you are on a budget, than add this release to cart, turn it up & enjoy!"
2,FALLing Asleep . . .,"As an avid horse show-er myself, I was excited to hear about this book and was told it was an accurate depiction of horse show life. While Maristed does describe the horse show world fairly accurately, I find her writing to be tedious and disjointed. It was difficult to follow her choppy descriptions and one-word sentences sometimes. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the love story aspect of the novel more than the horse scenes--Maristed simply seems unsure of herself when attempting to describe horse show life and uses awkward imagery and short verbage in a poor attempt (I think) to up the suspense factor."
2,buy the complete 2nd season instead,this makes no sense why they are reissuing this in pieces. just very disappointing because the show is so great but they're screwing up the dvd releases.
5,Great Garden Designs with Excellant Information,"This is, without a doubt, one of the finest gardening design books I have come across. It shows many different styles of gardens with distinct flair. If you want to be inspired by innovative ideas, buy it. It is one of my two favorite gardening books---and I have many."
5,WONDERFUL Book,"This book is fabulous. It combines the history of cooking, in America, with a cookbook that details many of the recipes it highlights. These are not modern recipes; these are historical recipes. They don't contain ready-made add-ins, nor have they been tinkered with, to allow them to be cooked in the microwave, but if you are interested in cooking, (for reasons other than sustenance), this book is VERY interesting and VERY rewarding. I highly recommend it. Even if you never make one of the recipes, the book is fascinating all by itself. You will learn SO many things that you never would have known, otherwise... from how common measures came about, to how a meal was ordered in an inn as travelers moved along the roads of a bygone era. Just fascinating."
1,Yawn,This book was a complete and utter bore. Nothing exciting AT ALL happened and it draaaaaags ever so much. Save your $25 -- get The Tooth Fairy!
3,"Works as advertised, just not helpful for me","These work exactly as advertised; however, they allow the door to open enough that my 9 month old can get his fingers pinched in the drawer or door. And he does pinch his fingers all the time! I switched to the magnetic style lock so that he can't get the door open at all. Would work better maybe for older children who are less likely to slam little fingers."
3,Cracked after a Few Days,"This concrete patch is decent, but I've found epoxy works much better, and is less likely to crack. I used this in my garage, and applied the concrete patch over a crack in it, and let it sit for over a day. It was applied correctly, in a clean area - no dirt. Within the next few days, it cracked back open. I've used epoxy on other cracks and have not had this issue. Plus, concrete does not expand like epoxy does. This may have more resiliency inside, but it doesn't seem to take extreme temperatures well. This cracked during a 100 degree day."
4,2nd Time User,Gr8 for small jobs outside the house. I have used this 2 times and am satisfied. Be careful to wear gloves and have some old pants and clothes on because it can be a little messy.
4,May not be best Dr Who ever... but darn close.,"As Dr Who shows go, this is one of the greats. Yes, it is sentimental and thin on story, but every Dr Who Christmas special is. This one seemed more kid friendly than past specials. This is as solid a Dr Who script as any, great acting all round, fantastic special effects.Technically, I would strongly recommend the download version. The picture is just cleaner through the fast action sequences. I have had issues streaming the 5.1 sound, so far all I can get is 2channel."
5,Great Christmas well spent!,"This episode is great for any Doctor Who fan. In classic Stephen Moffat style you learn more about the Doctor's character and the plot wraps up nicely while still leaving you with a few unsolved mysteries. Also lots of classic Dr. Who references to keep you laughing, smiling, and shouting for more."
5,Fun for all!,"Everyone in our household enjoyed this episode of Doctor Who. From 9 years to 44years old, there was something for everyone. We usually don't watch ""reruns"" but we watched this episode at least 3 times each! This episode in particular was hilarious :-)"
5,Omgeeeee!,"I'm still missing #10, but these specials are great. 2011 christmas special was so original, but 2012 was excellent also! And Clara/Oswin/Whoever she is ROCKS. Love how smart she is, she has the potential to give the Doctor a run for his money!"
4,satisfing my curiosity,"interesting premise ,started watching series ay the urging of my grandson ,will watc a few more episodes, entertaining enough to warrant further review"
5,dr. who,"what can I say, it's dr who, just wish they shows would come out faster, thanks amazon for making it were I can watch them again"
5,Love,"I love all Dr Who, awesome show but wish there was more to it. It is definately worth the watch though."
4,Very good! Liked Past ones Better!,"Hi,all fans! Can't wait for series to start this year! This Christmas Special was okay and entertaining! The ones from the past with David Tennant were much better!Let's hope Matt Smith can keep this show going into his second season as The Doctor.I like Amy Pond(Karen Gillan)as his sidekick!"
5,Fantastic Christmas Special,"Without giving away anything, this is a fantastic Christmas Special! And it has a great mystery wrapped up in the story. After watching this one, I am all stoked to see the rest of season 7!"
3,Rushed,Watching this episode I was left with the distinct impression that Moffat rushed through the story and tried to put more into the hour long episode than actually made sense. There is little to no development of the connection between the Doctor and Clara before the two seem to be on a level of depth equal to that originally shared with Amy Pond. It took years to develop that relationship to what it became and the viewers are led to believe there is an equal level of depth between the Doctor and Clara. It's a bit much.It was fun to see the new TARDIS layout and I did appreciate bringing back the characters from A Good Man Goes to War. Three stars for being another great performance by Matt Smith. It would have been five had it not been for the rushed story development.
5,Love this show,This show is great I haven't come across and episode I haven't liked yet and I've seen all 7 seasons and all specials
5,Amazing,"If you don't like sci-fi or Dr. Who, don't bother. This was one of my favorite holiday specials ever. I love how the new season is showing greater forethought in its programming and storylines than in the past."
3,"great show, but the video quality got fuzzy 3 times during the show, even though my internet connection was fine","great show, but the video quality got fuzzy 3 times during the show, even though my internet connection was fine"
1,Lametastic!,"Wow, I thought this was an actual episode and instead it is under 2 mins long! Please DO NOT make the same mistake I did when you can find this same video for FREE on youtube!"
1,Contact Amazon for your refund,"If this video was auto-purchased for you, because you had a subscription to Season 6, you should click the Help and then Contact Us buttons on Amazon, and demand a refund of this ""purchase"". I did so about an hour ago, and an Amazon.com rep responded very quickly apologizing, and informing me the purchase would be refunded. I suggest you do the same."
5,Best Dr Who Special Ever,This special aired on Christmas Day and we forgot to DVR it. If you a Dr Who Fan and I know there are many out there this is a must see and must have. We purchased this episode in HD and we were not disappointed. And now we can watch it again and again. In amazon library you save computer space as well as shelf space. Loving IT!
4,book lover,"Except of the beginning with the bear that scares my 2 years old, the movie is pretty good."
4,LOL,"I think the biggest jab and perhaps the best hidden one is the fact that someone stole from someone too big to to get away from, so he must deceive simpler subjects in order to save his butt. A ton of hilarity follows, and I think most people take another look at coexisting with wildlife."
4,Love Shreck - You'll Like this,"Very funny and entertaining. Even for the adults.It's not as good as the first Schreck, but it's one you will watch with the kids more than once."
5,My son LOVES this movie!,My son (6) saw this in the theater and couldn't wait until it was out on DVD -- it's really a cute movie and entertaining for adults too!
2,SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKS.,"It's like a CGI movie for kids made by annoying hipsters. I thought the cast sounded decent, but the point of seems to complain about suburban consumerism. I'm a pretty liberal guy, but this was really over the top and preachy. And the music sucks. My kid seems to enjoy it, but I'm not trying to brainwash him, you know?"
5,Well done movie - for kids and adults alike!,"Yeah yeah yeah, it was intended to kids...but the movie is so well made that grown-ups like yours truly will thoroughly enjoy it. The movie has thought provoking satire of modern lifestyle (SUVs, pizza delivery, urban sprawl, strip malls, and the like)that grown ups can immediately relate to.A bonus feature on the DVD shows what technology and blend of art, physics, computing and psychology a film of this caliber takes. If you are outside the intended age group for this movie (read: kids) and have no kids, I just gave you a perfect excuse to justify this DVD! Overall, highly recommended."
4,DIE HARD WITH A SQUIRREL,"This entertaining animated romp showcases the vocal talents of a lot of good actors, including Bruce Willis as the conniving racoon who enlists the aid of fellow forest mates to amass a ton of food for a bear that has threatened the coon unless he does so. Of course, the animals think the coon's out to feed them, but we all know that when the garbage clears, the raccoon is going to see the error of his ways.Excellent animation abounds with some choice funny moments and commentary on human's obsessions. Along with Willis, we get Garry Shandling as the turtle, William Shatner as the possum with Avril Lavigne as his daughter, Nick Nolte as the bear, Steve Carrell as the hyper squirrel, Wanda Sykes as the sassy skunk and Thomas Haden Church as the nutso exterminator. It's all in good fun and the whole family should enjoy it."
5,Over The Hedge,My 3 year old loves this movie. Just received it a few days ago and she sat quietly (which almost never happens) and giggled through the entire film. I thought it was cute as well and even caught myself giggling at a few parts. :)
4,Great Family Enjoyment,My family loved this movie! It was a lot of fun to sit back and relax and watch this movie on a cold winter night.
4,Excellent book (or a single chapter made into a book),Great book... a quick read but it does dribble out. Perhaps about a chapter's worth of great stuff extended into a full length book. A good book to botrrow or even browse in a bookstore... but I bought it and I'm glad I read it.
5,Innovative Traditional Designs,These designs are new spins on traditional patterns. Usually Fons and Porter use more than one color scheme so that the same design takes on different moods. I subscribe to the authors magazine. Each issue has some quilt that I must have. Enjoy!
2,Pages water damaged and matted together,"If not for the fact that I really needed this book and could salvage the pages that I needed, I would have returned it immediately! The Table of Contents are a complete loss because this book either survived a flood or the handler neglected to tell me that the pages were going to be stuck together so I could not salvage it... WTF were they thinking sending the book out like that?The book in itself is a fantastic find and I plan on recouping my loss brand new when I can afford it, but for now reading it in its present state is all I can afford."
1,Better First Printing,"I purchased this book for my daughter, who is a new quilter, and she loved it. I have the first printing and I preferred it. Overall it is a good book to start your quilting."
5,all this and two track too...,"made like his last two outings with the catholics, on a two track. Once again this doesn't deter from any of the 'frankness' you've come to expect, and will leave many sound engineers scratching their heads, and looking questioningly at their 128 track mixing desks.all of the hallmark cleverness is there, lyrics that will have you reaching for the dictionary ['cinnabar' and 'zugzwang' anyone ?] and a verse chorus structure in 'i've seen your picture' that keeps cutting itself in half until you're left with only two bars of each. definitely more 'peter, paul and mary' than the 'husker du' of the last two albums, not a shame, but afficianados will doubtless confirm that franks who rock, rock. buy it and then go and see him live."
3,Panasonic 4 handset,I like the concept of 4 handsets on one phone. What I don't like is that (1) there is no digital display of the number of messages there are (2) key pad does not light up (3) phone does not display date/time (4) phonebook does not automatically transfer to other handsets (4) recharging stations are very light and tip over easily. I am not very happy about this purchase.
5,excellent product,I read the reviews before I choze this phone system and I am not in the least unhappy. They are easy to use as promised.
4,No Audible Notification Answering Machine,"Great phones! Just wish it had audible notification option when you have a message. I knew it only had blinking light recognition when I bought it, but still wish it had it. I confirmed with Panasonic just in case - no luck :("
5,Extremely happy,"Purchased this Panasonic Telephone from Amazon recently, was very pleased with the purchase price, received this item in a very timely manner, have purchased from Amazon many times before and will continue to do so. Extremely happy with the telephone, best we have had for reception and suits our needs very well."
4,Excellent Phone,I purchase this phone a week back and very happy with it. Voice clarity is superb and manual is nicely written. Four handsets makes it vrey convinient to pick up the nearest phone. Some suggestions - Panasonic can add few more tones ( Like in cell phone ) so that they can be assigned to different incoming numbers. Also you cannot make out how many messages you have received. Overall I am very satisfied with this phone.
1,Terrible cookbook,I did'nt find anything worthwile. I develop for an enterprise wide application and this book was of no help. Everything in the book is either known by most developers or you can find it online for free without buying the book.Therefore my advice is DONT BOTHER TO GET THE BOOK.
3,The Spirit of Christmas - Book Nineteen,"I have been a crafter for many years and have used this particular series of books for quite a few of them. Many of the ideas are very good and the photography is done very well. I have found the recipes to be delicious and the directions clear although many are not for the novice cook. NOTEWORTHY; it is not always easy and sometimes impossible to find the supplies listed for some of the projects. I have often been forced to substitute with something else that was close to what was originally called for. I would like to see a ""Resources List"" with names/addresses/telephone numbers added to these books where project-specific supplies could be purchased."
5,Great Value,These work pants are a great value and quality for the price. They wash up great and little wrinkling after drying and hanging up.
3,ONLY 3 BELT LOOPS,"Good pants, I own other pairs....except this pair had only 3 BELT LOOPS!!!!! WHAT!? Thus 3 stars.kept them because I dont always wear a belt, and it did not impede the functionality of the pant."
3,Very durable,"You really cant find pants any tougher than these, they are all i wear to work. The price is very reasonable but it took 6 days before they were even shipped to me."
5,One of the best of World Music,"Like Yothu Yindi, Warumpi Band is another great World Music band from Australia. Excellent for relax after a surf session."
3,It's okay.,"It's neat that you can ""close it up"" to store it but the screw doesn't tighten like you think it should. But it works fine."
3,Game Theory Schmeary,Not as good as I was promised. It's a decent explanation but I was hoping for something a little different. If that doesn't make sense then I can't help you.
5,No-rinse fresh cleanliness,"Aloe Vesta Cleansing Foam is fantastic for no-rinse peri-care. A fresh clean scent, aloe softeners, and the easy pump bottle make caregiving a breeze. This is an excellent product for those with dementia or cognitive impairment. It doesn't feel wet, or cold, or hot. The light foam cleans well with one or two wipes."
3,Silent Greats,Delivery and all was fine. It would have been nice to have a larger photo or some description of the video. I didn't realize it only had Keaton and Chaplin. It looked like an anthology with other actors as well.
2,Errors,"I have noticed many errors in this book. If you are going to buy it, please read it carefully and try to find the errors. Afterall, wouldn't that be a good way to study for an AP test?"
4,Good book and good review of topics but many errors.,This book was helpful in reviewing for the AP test. It covers the major topics well and the sample tests are helpful. HOWEVER there are many many errors in this book in the code fragments etc. To use this book in a sense you must be smarter than it to find and not learn the errors the wrong way.
4,Good inspiration for patchwork blocks,"Although strip quilting is my favorite type of quilting, this book was inspiring enough that I did a quilt for a classroom and had each student picked out a favorite block. The instructions on how to make the block were good. Although I thought making pieced blocks would be too difficult, it was surprising to me how easy it was to make some really cute blocks. Pieced patchwork blocks may not be my favorite but I now consider them to be attractive and fun."
2,Buzz,"Buzz is big and bulky and is not easy for my son to play with. He does not stand up easily, his arms only rotate from the elbow. The sound effects are nice but other than that, the rest is not impressive."
4,Perfect Yankee,"The Perfect Yankee is a very informative book about the events and persons surrounding the only perfect, no-hitter ever played in the World Series."
4,i luv,"A very nice clock radio , nice looking, sounds really good for it's size. Only thing is volume control is hard to turn up or down,also with the ipod to go off in the morning it's VERY loud!"
2,A little misled,"For anyone considering this product it is a great idea, but if you are the owner of an iPod shuffle that is a year or more old, it doesn't work with the iLuv system. I am a little disappointed that there was no mention of this issue until I looked in the troubleshooting section of the manual. Obviously, after I bought it."
2,A couple show-stoppers,"Unit performs well as an alarm clock radio with MP3 capabilities, however, has serious shortcomings for as an MP3 player. Bought two identical units for my daughter's new iPod nano's. Both iLuv units fail to charge these iPods - two clues confirm this - there's no charging icon on the iPods while the unit is docked, and the iPods eventually lose battery power while docked. Complicating this is the fact that none of the dock adapters match the iPod nano form. The dock adapter shipping with the iPod itself is the best match. Also, the volume cannot increased greater than 50% w/o significant distortion/crackling. Again, both iLuv units display similar characteristics with either iPod.Tech support claims the latest iTunes software comes with the latest iPod firmware updates which address these problems. Unfortunately, they are wrong as we have the latest software for both. Since then, they have offered to replace both units via an ""rm"" process."
4,excellent moneys worth,"Everyone with an iPod knows about the iHome. I wanted the iHome but didn't want to pay the $90 or however much it was at the time for it. I investigated for alternatives and found the iLuv for about $30 cheaper with the same amount of good reviews. So I took a chance and bought it.I wasn't expecting an outstanding audio experience, so I wasn't at all disappointed. This is perfect to play music while I'm studying, cleaning my room, playing games, whatever.Buy it if you have an iPod (unless you're someone with an already good audio system [i.e. surround sound] that you could plug into."
5,Best bedside radio I've ever had,"I would recommend this radio/alarmclock/ipod charger/time keeper to absolutely anyone. I know they have come out with newer versions of this model, and the newer features look really awesome, but I feel like this version has more than enough features for me and works flawlessly! It's especially good if there are two or more ipods in a household, there's no ejecting anything or worrying if its compatible, trust me just plug in and play or charge or listen to the radio!"
3,not a bad product,i bought it because for the most part the reviews all said that the alarm was loud. and it is for the most part.the buzzer is more like a tornado siren and yet i am still managing to sleep through it because some how when i hit snooze its turning the alarm off. maybe when they redesign it they can fix the issue and have the snooze go until you turn the alarm buttons off like all other clocksother than that i am pleased with the product
1,Poor quality!,"I liked it at first despite the fact that the time shone, at its lowest setting so brightly, it lit up the room. I put a clear red film over it to darken it. After a few months, one of the lights went out so that I now have a choice between very dim (with no red film) ~ my fave, STROBE!, or bright-ish. All this is annoying but I can adapt. The dock fitting for my nano didn't fit so I just had to plug it in free standing. Add too that, I just got a Nano, gen 4 and this iLuv doesn't charge it! It charged my old nano but not this one.Now the ""can't live without"" feature doesn't work! I used to set the time for 15 minutes of play to put me to sleep and then it shuts off. Now that I can't do that, it has become worthless.I abhor waste and it kills me to have to chuck this after 1 1/2 years. No more iLuvs for me."
4,Great Welch Choirs,Great mens' choirs from all over Wales. Wonderful inspiring music. A unique seldom heard sound these days. Selections include choral classics and musical theater numbers. A bargain of 5 CD's.
4,Great if you have to write a lot,"I recently had to write a lot of handwritten thank-you letters for an organization, and this pen was very helpful. It significantly reduced the amount of hand strain I would have gotten. It also made writing feel a lot more ""fun.""The cons are that my writing got a little bit sloppier- but not much at all. After a little practice, it got to the point where my writing was practically normal. Also, its a little expensive, especially with shipping. However, given how much time and strain I saved, it was certainly worth it for me."
5,Book 1 of series begins with unusual twist to love story,"This story was well written and had some interesting twists to it. I felt like I knew the main characters Alex and Hannah. The love story starts out on an unusual twist but you feel compelled to keep reading to find out how the story ends. It leads in to the second book of the Texas Sheikhs series ""His Arranged Marriage"" by Tina Leonard. I highly recommend this book!"
5,Best of the Best,"I've enjoyed everything that I've read by Gemmell and consider him one of the top five writers of heroic fantasy / Sword & Sorcery ever. That list includes Robert E. Howard, Karl Edward Wagner, and Glen Cook. This book, The Swords of Night and Day, is quite simply the best of the best."
5,Wonderful Movie,Those who are fans of Dario Argento know that his films can be a little odd at times; this one has a little more substance than the others and I have to admit the ending is to die for - no pun intended.
3,Blue underground version,Decent film. The anchor bay version had italian audio on the restored scenes. It's kinda wierd because the film randomly breaks from english into italian. Did blue underground fix that on this disc?
4,"a work of superior craftsmanship, although a bit lengthy","""Deep Red"" is yet another over-stylized giallo from director Dario Argento, who gave us ""Suspiria"" and ""Tenebrae,"" among other films. It concerns a jazz pianist who falls witness to a brutal hatchet murder, and finds himself in jeopardy as the killer starts to pick off everyone around him. The movie (in its uncut 126-minute version) is a bit slow at times, and the split use of subtitles and dubbing is very awkward, but if you stick with it it'll definitely be worth your while. An unnerving score by Goblin and masterful set pieces give ""Deep Red"" the extra push to make it yet another gem in Argento's relatively flawless career."
5,Deep into yourself...,What a great movie!!Impeccable!! Thanks Dario and Thanks to the Goblins...Love the soundtrack.A must see....LA LA LA LA LALALA LALALALA....LA LA LA LA LA LA LALA LALALALAAAAA..... ENJOY IT!!
2,Better Than Fulci? No way.........,"I love Fulci's movies. In the past two years with the help of the internet and Amazon in particular, Ive pursued his work. I'd noticed though that he was completely overshadowed by some guy named Dario Argento......so I decided to check out the two films that are his so called masterpieces. Deep red offered nothing more than good shot composition and ""OK"" music. No real violence, horrible story line, but one creative death scene. ARGENTO'S NO FULCI!"
3,Not that great and some senseless animal cruelty,"Although a decent horror movie with more excellent camera-work, compared to Tenebre, this was pretty weak. Plus, there were two scenes of animal cruelty that just lowered it for NO REASON."
3,Somewhat disapointed,"Being a true lover of B-horror movies,i felt a bit let down. My friend highly recommened it. Was hard to follow. Stupit of me,not setting it on English subtiltes. Going back and forth made me crazy. It just got old afer awhile. However,loved the overacting,esp. of the psychic. That bath tub scene was horrifing. But what i really loved watching was the beautiful settings,and superb cinamatographry. Maybe i'll give it another chance."
1,Very cheesily made and not a perfect fit,"As the title says, not made very well and was not a perfect replacement part. Had to modify to get the product to work."
5,Team Secrets of the Navy Seals,"Very good book. A must for all in management positions in the military, as well Americas first responders. No real secrets, however, the lay out fo the book along with the authors twists on the topics make it very educational and easy to read. Good for all LEO supervisors."
2,Waste of time and money,"I bought this DVD for some ideas for a routine for my dance class. There were three sections of actual dance moves with instruction. Each set was short and fast. There is no way I'd want to see my girls dancing like this either!! There was more time spent on the ""Behind the Scenes and the Freestyle (which was bad too!) than on the actual instruction. Waste of money!!"
4,Cute book,"This is a funny book, with a very unusual perspective on the weather. We bought it because our family loves the writer's other book: ""Animals should Definately not wear Clothing"" which we much prefer to this one."
5,Hungry for a good read with your little one,"I remember reading this book to my baby brother. This book was my baby brother's favorite and we had to read it everynight before bedtime. Now I have introduced it to my little ones, twin 3 1/2 year old boys. They love this story. It gets them giggling and creating their own food storms. We enjoy reading it also to the boys."
2,Meatballs book,"I don't really like this book because of its ugly colors and style of artwork, it's too wordy, and it's just kind of too weird for my taste, but my 2 1/2 year old seems to like it enough to ask me to read it to him every now and then, and he's the reason I bought it."
5,Superbly absurd children's book for 4-6 year olds & parents,"When my first child was an infant, a friend told me to selectbook for her that I would enjoy reading myself, because shewould demand that they be read time and again. 19 years laterI can still read Cloudy with a Chabce of Meatballs and laugh.Imagine a place where there are no food stores, and wherethe food falls from the sky! Eggs over easy in the morningwith a drizzle of OJ... you get the idea. Great illustrations,great sense of the absurd. I can understadn how a kid couldcome up with a book like this, but you really have towonder (in the most positive sense) at an adult who does."
5,LOVE this book!,"This book is wonderful! I love the story line and it's so much fun to read to my younger classes. I was so pleased with this book!!! If you didn't read it as a child, you definately should read it as an adult. Great book!!!"
4,"An easy read, comforting at times",I think overall the book offered great guidance and different perspective. I think it is to be used more for a personal analysis. I recommended this book to others who enjoyed it as well.
4,Solving the puzzle,"Great book that sums up many of the intuitive thoughts you have with yourself every day but never made complete sense. Mira Kirshenbaum assists you, in a clear and concise manner, in putting the final pieces into your jigsaw puzzle life! Great for gifts as well......"
1,I paid for THIS?,"There are many, many better candle magick books out there. This one is the scantiest and also most egotistical I've seen. All of the so-called spells require some of her oils and incense, and none of the info is real helpful either."
3,Good reel bad hose.,"I normally don't take the time to write reviews but here I go. So I ordered this reel because it had good ratings. When it came in it was damaged in the shipping. I had read someone else had the same problem. The round part was a little bent and some paint had chipped off but otherwise it worked fine. This did not bother me plus i assume the next one would most likely come in the same way. The reel is kinda heavy seems to be built well. I have been using it for about 6 months now. The hose turns brittle and cracks. I have had to cut off 1 foot of the end. This happens around the end where it gets the most movement. I figure I will either keep cutting the hose till i run out or I will buy a coupler and add some GOODYEAR hose. So if you buy this real be warned it maybe be damaged on arrival, the hose cracks, so you might want to replace it with a better goodyear one. Otherwise it has been working great. I hope this helps someone make the right decision if they want to buy this."
5,Excellent study of Japanese culture,"I loved the book because it offered little-known insights into Japanese culture. For instance, it explained why the Japanese surrendered graciously after World War Two. Surprised American occupational soldiers found the Japanese to be friendly. The book explains the culture of obligation and the different types of obligation. I welcome email from anyone who like to share their feelings on this book or Japanese culture."
1,A thought occurs,"The book is from 1946. Not a few social anthropologists and students of the history of thought have said that the book should be understood as a result of WWII and not as independent research. Those guys are supposed to be inspired by Geertz and apply rules for analyzing fiction to studying anthropological monographies. But hey, what do I know."
2,Not really a vampie novel....,"Okay...I know that it says it's a vampie novel....it's really not. Sure there was a vampie, but it was kind of made of wax...This vampie (max) has a lot of mind control on others, and that's it. He did his wammie on others to get them to do his will. We meet an somewhat interesting cast of characters. I'd love to have know more about Emily.For me...what brought his book down...there really wasn't any vampies munching. Just a lil bit. I read a lot of vampie novels, and the one thing I like to have in my vampie books is ""vampie"" munching.This was just a slow moving read. If you want to read it, I suggest you try and find it at the used bookstore or better yet at a library."
1,for 3 yr olds only,This book was a complete waste of money and covered vague basic facts about solar. Not for any body wanting to learn do it your self installs or solar applications. I learned more in elementary school about solar power than this book had in it. A complete waste. Guess I am an idiot for buying it.
2,Executive Party,"I bought this album for the psychedelic lounge ""Executive Party"" and ""Executive Party Dance"" tracks. Everything else is classical soundtrack fodder. Two cool tracks does not a cool album make.It's almost worth having in your collection just for the sake of being odd (a classical album with spiked-gauntlet roller derby warriors in the liner notes?), if that's your thing. Just don't expect to listen to it.If somebody knows of albums that capture the sound of the two tracks I mentioned above... THAT album would be golden."
1,Boring and dumb,I thought this would be an exciting workout but it is just a bunch people that he is training and they are all doing what he does. No talking what so ever and does not keep you interested. I found it to be very boring. I was hoping for a little more than what I paid for.
1,I WANT MY MONEY BACK!,"First thing's first, if you're buying these DVDs because you're a Chuck Liddel fan, HE'S NOT IN IT!Secondly, these drills are a joke, if you've ever actaully trained in an MMA, Muay Thai, Boxing, or BJJ gym these workouts are complete nonsense.They're poorly paced, there is no discussion of technique at all and if you're used to a real fight gym the intensity level here will put you to sleep.Even if you aren't really training there are better resources, I would recommend Bas Rutten's set of CD's, they're well paced, well produced, and you can load them into an ipod or boombox anywhere you need them."
1,CST Berger Customer Service,"Terrible Customer Service. DO not expect any quick action and be prepared to make numerous phone calls including to the manager of customer service.Unfortunatly, I have not found anyone higher up to compalin to yet, but will continue to look for someone so that perhaps they can review policy and act appropiatley. Very unsatisfied."
4,Happy and not...at the same time,"The book was in excellent condition and was exactly what i was looking for. However, the original price was on the dust jacket - $29.99. I paid over a hundred dollars for it. So, while very pleased to have the book, feeling a bit ripped off."
1,Not Worth Money,"My initial reaction was positive, but when the bulb died after only a short period of use, my advice is to look elsewhere for a slide viewer."
4,Great 70's gothic horror,"This film is sadly overlooked and forgotten about, and should recieve a Renaissance. It's a really creepy little vampire film done with a certain amount of class about two bisexual bloodsuckers who lure men to their castle for orgies and blood drinking. It has a nice gothic ambience reminiscient of the classic chillers of the 70's. Not only is there a fair amount of sex(if you like that sort of thing)but also plenty of nicely colored blood, not red paint. Highly recommended for everyone."
2,Poor excuse for a vampire film,"On the dvd commentary, one of the producers admits that they made this film with 2 things in mind - sex and blood. That should serve as a warning. A poorly executed plot (if you can call it that) simply serves as an excuse to show the two stars having sex, sex and more sex. To its credit, the film does have a gothic feel to it with a castle setting and moody lighting. But, unfortunately, you need much more to make a good film. Nothing of significance happens during the first 40 minutes and the dialogue is inane. A total bore, of interest only to heterosexual men."
4,Haunting,"I saw this movie in 1974 as a double billing with ""Black Christmas"" and both films scared me in a different way. They are both excellent films. OK Vampyres ""Their lips are moist and very very red"" so the caption tells us and it is certainly correct. This remastered edition is excellent UNCUT & UNCENSORED and u won't find any fangs here which I think is why I enjoyed it all the more. Fran and Miriam kill their victims with whatever is at arms reach or mouths reach. The music is subtle the house is creepy (same house used in ""Rocky Horror picture Show"") Watch in the dark late at night."
3,"PRETTY GOOD,BUT NOT GREAT","Fairly entertaining movie.Not very scary or suspenseful,but pretty erotic.The 2 women were beautiful.The only thing I had a problem with was that they devoted too much time showing that guy walk around the castle,then walk outside,then walk here,then walk there...he did too much walking around! It really broke the flow of the movie,but besides that it was pretty good."
4,Unsettling!,"Although a lot of the reviews have focused on the sex in this movie (and yes, there are plenty of soft-core scenes), this movie was quite unsettling. The violence is truly shocking and disturbing, and by the end, I was more than a little creeped out and quite glad I'd left the lights on. The actresses really go all out and appear quite unhinged and bloodthirsty, and the director makes so much of his cast and locations that you'd hardly know this was shot on a shoe-string budget."
5,Make it Fifteen,"At the time of writing, 14 viewers have rated this 5 stars and one lone sceptic a single star. Include me in with the former. I was anxious about buying a VHS version instead of a DVD ( money is short in the post-Christmas period ) but I need not have worried. The quality of this tape is excellent: bright vivid images and lovely colour tones. The orchestra sounds a little scrawny, but the music is so predictable that it hardly matters, and I have heard worse on highly-rated DVDs. The entire cast dances with grace, panache, and remarkable technical skill. Baryshnikov's choreography as well as his personal performance bring our all the excitement that a top class ballet experience can provide. In addition to classical dancing of the highest order, there is much side play and tomfoolery that might otherwise prove irritating were it not for the infectious humour and enthusiasm of the participants. In two words, highly recommendable."
1,NOT suitable for deep pile,"On carpet & pad much less than the stated 3/4"" it will bend, cup under chair wheels, and last less than a year, at best. I've had 3 of them under the warranty. All performed the same."
3,Fuel Tank,"Amazon had the best pprice for this tank. It looks to be of quality construction and well buit. The old tank has anti-rub padding stuck on the top, the new tank does not come with it, so need to find something to replace th old stuff. the filler neck is slightly shorter than the original, I was able to get the hose on and clamp it, but just barely. The tank straps had to be reshaped. It does th job."
1,"Makes lofty claims, fails to live up to them","This is a good, if somewhat pricey regular pillow. Expect nothing else and you'll likely be fairly happy. The 'temperature regulation' claims are just that, claims. Any temp regulation experienced is placebo factor. My rating is based upon the mfgr. claims."
1,bad,It came broken. It will not allow me to put more than a few staples in as the arm is stuck. If you could send me another one I will return this one.
3,RED Light,There's a red light on the stapler and I have been charging it for a week and it won't turn green. I don't know if it's charged yet. I still have to order staples. Can't use it to see if it's charged until I get staples.
5,A Commentary that is so easy to read...,I have often found commentaries to be long & dry. James Montgomery Boice fills the pages with Bible based truth and insights that are so easy to take away with you. The truths are practical and he makes it clear how they can be applied. I have read a number of his commentaries and look forward to reading others.
1,DONT BUY IT SAVE YOUR MONEY,DONT BUY IT SAVE YOUR MONEYI did not get the software. The manual is very hard to understand. Many items are not spelt right.Amazon should be careful of what they carry.
3,"Happy that it's finally arrived, but....","This was a great series that I enjoyed in syndication, and I was very pleased to hear that season 2 was finally coming out on DVD (especially since it's been a few years since the release of season1). So far I don't have any complaints with the quality, packaging, art work, ect. However, the discs aren't labeled with the episode titles, and the episodes are out of order to boot. Not too much of an overall issue, being that the individual episodes do pretty much stand on their own, storyline-wise. But there are a few that are part of overall story arcs which can be confusing if viewed out of sequence. I hope they can iron out these problems and possibly re-release season 2, thus making it smoother to watch as a whole."
3,No subtitles,I have two episodes left to watch. Like has been already pointed out the original discs were out of broadcast order and also missing one episode.Amazon did try via several E-mails to get me to pay for the replacement discs or to return the original discs at my expense until I found the link to write a reply. They did indeed bill my credit card but after a sharply worded response from me along with the original E-mail stating that return was NOT necessary I also received a credit.The biggest problem as far as I'm concerned is the lack of closed captioning or English subtitles. The background music is at such a high level and the actors are often speaking in whispers or hushed tones to point that I miss a fair amount of the dialogue even with the volume turned up quite high. If there is ever a re-release with subtitles I will buy it.
1,Poltergeist : The Legacy s2,I WOULD NEVER BUY A DVD-R BOX SET I THINK THIS SUCKS AFTER MGM PUT OUT S1 WHY IN THE HELL WOULD THEY NOT DO THE REST OF THEM
2,"Good product, lousy company","2 stars -- 4 for the product, 0 for the seller.The stepper is working fine after 6 weeks of regular use. However, the included ""computer"" never worked out of the box. I sent the seller -- Allegro Medical -- 3 emails to their ""customer service"" address. No response. Allegro did list an 800 # in a shipping status email sent before the stepper arrived, but this sort of poor service disgusts me to the point where I haven't called. (And frankly, I never saw the computer as much of a benefit -- but that's hardly my point.)Furthermore, once Allegro had my email address, they sent me spam newsletters every day. I had to un-subscribe to stop them. If this callous disregard of their customers' welfare is another indicator of Allegro's attitude toward customer service, then they're hardly a company I can recommend doing business with.Good product (computer aside), lousy company. If you don't need the computer, buy this stepper. But buy it elsewhere."
3,needed item,"I use this item a lot. I couldn't live without it but wish it would lock a little more securly, or with some spring action. A big guy walking by it will deflect a wood floor enough to make the laser jamb loose between floor and ceiling so you have to be careful where you set it."
5,The best thing so far....,"LP is second to none in practical travel advice. This guide makes no exception. We were the first to actually use the guide book even a little before the publication date. We used it in all three countries. The only thing I might critisize is that Malawians are really not *that* friendly (Zambians are), but opinions differ about this. Prices in $ would be better."
1,I cannot rate this item,I cannot rate this item as despite my order over one month ago--the goods despite being paid for have still not yet arrived
5,Peggy Lee reviisited 2013.,"The title couldn't have been more apt,a hugely satisfying trip down memory lane. Her superb delivery combined with wonderful backing groups made this ,for me ,a stellar buying decision! I now need the c d for the car,how about it?"
5,Easily the best debut album ever,"Coming after endless years of flabby glam and mushy disco, this album reminded us of what rock and roll is supposed to be. From beginning to end, it is so relentlessly tough, edgy, and downright overpowering that it will rearrange your teeth in their sockets. As a public safety consideration, do not play this CD while driving in your car. Easily the best debut album by anybody, ever."
1,Penmanship Made Easy -- Not!,"I have trouble calling this a book. It's a bound collection of calligraphy, and not very good calligraphy at that. Many letters are unreadable. Penmanship should be to help communicate by written word. This book is not helpful unless you're experienced with calligraphy."
3,Not Terrible but not great. Acting and plot are pretty lame.,"Police in Detroit are looking for a stolen revolver used in a murder a few years ago. Rich (Jackson) and Angel (Kilmer) are crime partners involved with the distribution of arms. Overall better then I expected it to be, (50 Cent wrote it). We find out pretty early that Rich is the one with the revolver and from then on it gets pretty predictable. For the type of movie it is, I will give it a 6 out of 10, but don't let that deceive you, it's better then Streets of Blood (the last Jackson and Kilmer movie) but thats not saying a whole lot. If you are looking for a top notch, exciting action flic I'd go with A-Team over this one. I will say that this is Kilmer's best movie in awhile, which again isn't saying a whole lot. I give it a C+."
1,Useless in case of emergency,I purchased the product hoping to diagnose & hopefully fix a hard drive that had essentially crashed.The emergency disk that came with the program turned out to be useless -- no better than Microsoft's ScanDisk program.What worked? Downloading the diagnostic program made specifically for my hard drive by its manufacturer (Maxtor).I can't speak to the other utilities in the suite as I will be returning the program.
1,Don't Buy,This software is garbage. I bought this product based on magazine reviews - don't trust them. I had read that Norton's Systemworks has problems as well and that is why they only pre-install the anti-virus application on new computers. I have Windows Me on a new Dell 8100.Ontrack looked interesting but don't be fooled. The Crashproof application is supposed to stop crashes but all it did was lock up my system and take down my router - after I decided the cause of the problem and removed Systemsuite the router returned to normal. I also used the defrag - took forever and then locked up without completing its task. Also the virus scanner does slow down the system considerably. Take my advice - Don't Buy.
2,Soapy mystery,"This is a soap opera mystery, complete with sudsy acting (count the rolled eyes, smirks, ""Oh, my Gods,"" and loud exhales) and sappy writing. There is a wronged woman, a cheating husband, a black buddy (mouthing cliches),and a predictable switcheroo at the end. Surely this production was designed for at least one of the feminist television networks. The best that can be said it is that it contains some unintentional satire about contemporary movie makers....who think that we are all about fourteen."
5,Fragrant soap as gift,"Perfect small gift to add to a thank you. Even if you don't use fragrant soap, put it in a drawer or closet to add a touch of scent. You can unwrap the soap and leave in the plastic container, which has small holes to add more scent or just leave it wrapped."
4,penagain,"Nice pen - gets a lot of interesting comments, it lost a star because the ink cartridge seems to quit while writing."
5,Yummy and Nutritious,"This is the ideal product if you want something crunchy to snack on. High in protein and high in fiber, what more could you ask for. Forget the potato chips and give this bad boy a whirl."
2,Not the same quality as before,"Like ""Techie Lawyer"" I too purchased several of these a few years ago--they were wonderful!! Very reliable, long battery life, seldom jammed, etc. My only complaint would have been the loosening of the depth guide such that I had to tape it in place to keep it from sliding back. But I just purchased a new one last week, and the thing is CRAP!!! It jammed on the very first use--it will not open, no way to pry it open to get the jam cleared. It is totally useless. Obviously, there has been a dramatic decrease in quality and workmanship. I could not recommend purchase of this item to anyone--unless you can find an older model, perhaps lighlty used, on eBay or similar."
2,Hard to see,"The writing in the book is so light it hard to see, like when printed the ink was low. Kept it."
3,An interesting mixture of popular tunes in Germany.,"The wonderful thing about this CD is that you will get to hear ""cool"" tunes that are rarely, if at all heard in the US. You will, however, have plenty of the American stuff, too. The thing with those ""Various Artists CDs"" that there are plenty of songs on it that one can do without. My personal my favorites are ""Chartbreaker"" which is German hip hop with smart lyrics and ""Electric City"" which is techno with melody that goes beyond a repetitous beat, songs you don't want to miss out on. This CD was compiled by VIVA, a German Music Televsion Station (which is also watched in Switzerland and Austria) and are quite recent songs from the charts."
3,Huge disappointment!!,Don't buy this game if you are expecting it to be the same as the old playstation game. It is nowhere near as good.
5,Nickelodeon Rugrats In Paris The Movie,I just got it yesterday I got it for [..] at T.J. maxx. Though it was crushed it is still a great game. The game was originally [..] then it was on clearance for $5.00 then there was a 25% off sale so it was [...] I thought the gameplay was going to be babyish but no this game is more challenging then I thought. It has some huge box damage. If you don't like this buy ROCKET POWER EXTREME Arcade Games it is really fun but you have to unlock Twister's game. Goto T.J. maxx to buy your PC Software. They have more games then you think!!!!
4,Great wedding gift,Looks good feels good. It was very nice. The couple I gave them to enjoyed them and thought it was very sweet.
4,Good book for beginners,"This is a good book for beginners in marketing research and want to know how to conduct market research. This is a book for the undergraduate marketing program. Our instructor used it for the MBA program as it explains some of the concepts really well.If you have done surveys, collected survey data, developed survey questionnaires, used statistical tools to analyze data and interpret results , this book is a waste for you. I hardly read this book for my program."
3,Classic American Indian,"The best was the Battle of Chief Pontiac which I saw as a kid in the theater and Sitting Bull. Cry Blood, Apache we just, well how should I put this...should have been left on the cutting room floor. Over all the set was entertaining."
1,"Laplink, the Long Downward Spiral","Laplink was the first to offer travellers dos software to transfer files from laptop to desktop and make backup up disks that were clones of the main hard drive. In addition, the dos version had a batch file function which could be used to backup only selected files. It ran flawlessly. Laplink 2000 and now, Laplink Gold,unfortunately are not worthy successors to the dos version. My experience is with Win98 and Laplink 2000 and Gold seem to have problems with it. The clone folder function causes fatal errors. Attempts to get help from Laplink support have come to naught. They haven't even bothered to answer my last email."
3,It Pulls You In,"My primary reason for buying this movie was because Scottie MacGregor was in it, and I'm an avid fan. However, I must admit, the film eventually pulled me in. It actually does have a plot, and the filming is excellent for 1970.But beware of nostalgia if you are old enough to remember the 70's."
2,Disappointing,"This book is mostly composed of footnotes!!! Footnotes, not narrative. The ""meat"" of the book could have been handled in about 50 pages (as it is there are only 5 chapters) and maybe less if the duplications were removed. Great concept and this guy certainly did a lot of research...but it is hardly worth the soft cover price. Thankfully,, I didn't buy the hardcover one."
4,"comfy, low profile",Very comfy shoes and not flashy. These sneakers go with almost everything I wear so it's easy when I'm in a rush to toss them on and go.
2,Wrong Photo!,"Like some other reviewers, the mat I received was not the one pictured. It is much less sturdy than indicated and is rectangular with a lip (the photo has no lip). It said it is suitable for standard carpet, but it is far too thin and flexible to provide the carpet protection and easy chair movement that I wanted. I paid $50, but it is the same as the ones you can get at Office Depot for less. And it is not worth returning; how would I ship this thing? Bummer."
5,Great Laser Level,"Did the research - found amazon most helpful...other products had few review. PLS had many and all favorable....bought the PLS-3 (wanted the PS-5 but too much$). It has been a real time saver for my foundation/slab work...now on to framing. ""don't know how I did without a good Laser Level""...BTW it is well built and made in the USA"
3,"Imprudent continuation of the hedonism espoused in ""Bible""","For those who haven't read any material on LaVey's Church of Satan, rest assured that it has little to do with evil and lots to do with plain old hedonism. In ""The Satanic Witch"", LaVey explains how witches should behave in order to best use their powers against male subjects; instead, it comes off as LaVey's veiled attempt to get his female followers to wear lots of makeup, high heels, and sexy skirts and blouses with a few buttons popped so he can leer at them. It is an entertaining read, however, and LaVey's ideas about personality types (based on the typical ectomorph/mesomorph comparison) are fairly interesting. The only shocking thing readers will find is in the introduction by LaVey's daughter, who explains that Daddy first gave her the tome to read at the ripe old age of eleven"
2,Wrong Stapler featured on ad!!,"I purchased the electric stapler based on the picture shown on the order form. I wanted a boston stapler which that's what was showing on the page and instead, I received an X-acto stapler (the featured item could be purchased in black or white and both pictures described the same item but I ended up with a totally different stapler)!This is not what I expected and not happy. I just hope this one works!"
3,Runs 1 size large! Weird fitments,"These athletic pants run 1 size large. I'm 6'0 and am between 34-36x32 in regular pant size. I've ordered the Large size and while they functioned well, they were very baggy in the thigh area, with a very odd, low hanging inseam. The elastic waist band kept them on snugly, but still too baggy for my liking.I ordered Medium size and now they fit perfectly, but they are a touch short for my height.Extremely comfortable and well priced, but the fitment disparities are a bit extreme."
2,"comfortable, but serious fluffs off","It is a very comfortable and nice looking pant. Also it looks more expensive than it really is. However, even I wore this 1~2 times and I didn't wash this yet, there were many fluffs off this."
1,Worst fit ever.,"These track pants are nothing like the image, they are really wide and baggy and unfitting, not wearable, they are awful."
4,"Good, but long","Love to run in these nice adidas Pants.They do fit a little large, in the waist and they are a bit long. I am 6' 2"" and they are probably 3-4"" long, where as other workout pants I own are not as long."
1,Pants,I didn't like the weird way they fit and I expected better quality from a brand like Adidas! They sucked!
2,Very Long,The fabric and color was good. But I ordered a tall and they are way to long. My husband is 6'2 and still they were too long. Sending back for regular.
3,Not quite what I envisioned,"I missed the high parts of the vocals. Didn't seem like Bobby felt very well and couldn't quite do the high notes. But he was in a lot of pain towards the end from what I hear, so that's understandable. I still love these guys though. And would recommend them to all."
3,oe?,"This is factory on an 84 s-10 2.8. Its not just like the original, but it will work. These are being discontinued by every other manufacturer so better get it while you can."
2,Poorly packaged,"When I received this product, the top of the container was not secure and it seemed that all of the cleaning solution had evaporated. There was some left on the bottom of the container which I swapped up with the cleaning tool, which wasn't nearly enough to clean my guitar. Basically, I received a dry cleaning stick. Maybe it would be better to purchase this item in a store rather than having it shipped?"
2,"Good tunes, odd recording","First, don't assume you can play this back on your computer, because the copy protection will get in the way and make the sound simply awful. Think back to the old VHS copy protection where the screen and volume would go up and down wildly, and you've nailed it. I was very disappointed that an original DVD chosen for its higher audio quality would act this way. It had to be played from a cheap hardware DVD player, and then the audio sounded a bit funny since I don't have 5.1 stereo. It's probably great if you have a surround-sound setup; otherwise, pass on to the regular CDs. Also, the music has been remastered and in some cases changed more than one might think, sometimes for the better, and equally often for the worse. I never thought I'd say this, but I recommend getting the ""lower quality"" CD - it'll sound better."
5,detail and deeply.,"Most books introduce the SAX with one or two chapters, providung the basic concept and use of SAX. However if you want to learn more detail of SAX and bring SAX into play well, this book will help you reach these.I think this book is not suiatable for SAX begginers. If you want to begging SAX, you may reading the SAX chapter in the general books of XML before reading this book. And I recommend the book ""Begging XML"" (David Hunter, Wrox).Though a little hard to reading, this book provide many useful and valuable example code. And it really discuss every topic deeply and in detail, so readers should take time to understand the core meaning of the author."
1,Never worked from the start,When the product arrived we put batteries in it and only one half of the shuffler worked. Where is my options for rating the item that never worked..
1,6 deck shuffler,"Have ordered about a dozen of these shuflers, they fall apart or don't work well while shuffling 6 decks. Have no other options so I keep ordering. These need to work properly; if not, am returning the whole bunch!Dot Tittle(903) 561-4010"
1,for arthritic hands,"I don't think this is a toy but it does the job. I bought another just like it, different brand name, to compare. Exactly the same so buy the cheaper one."
2,A little to Italian for this American reader.,"I actually read this book quite some time ago but remember being ,for the most part, lost by references to details that were maybe too 'detailed'. I do believe Eco is brilliant but many of the references in the book were to ideas or concepts native to Italy and times before I was alive.My distaste could be because after _Focault's Pendulum_ I expected so much."
2,"""Faithful Renditions""","I can't tell you my disappointment to learn this was NOT Herman's Hermits, but close copies (and sometimes not so close). Guitar work is not the right sound for the times. Many songs are played faster than the originals. The quality is good; if you just like the songs you may be happy, but I am a musician and I wanted the originals- and this is not it."
4,YES it measures rain !,Easy to read scale. funnel is made from thick clear plastic. Is resistannt to freezing. Will see in the long run if the UV sunlight will affect its condition!
3,Agree with all the other reviews,"I wanted a DVD player for the road when I was away on business, and maybe on my nightstand, because my wife can't sleep with the tv on. I wanted womething with a little smaller footprint, so I bought the Sony. OK, here's the staight stuff. Let's start with 3 stars, for the average player. Nice bright picture, add one star. 16x9 add a second star. Nice charging stand and two phono jacks, give it a third. Embedded battery instead of a replaceable one subtract a star. DVD player with a flip top instead of ejectable, subtract another. No memory stick slot, subtract a third. Do the math - three stars. I can't believe that Sony passed up the chance to sell a few more proprietary products like the memory sticks that and batteries that would make this really usefull. Compared to the other portable DVD players, this one is OK, so buy it if you find one cheap. Otherwise, get the monster Archos 504 that has no DVD, but is a really, really good portable player."
1,Another bad re-issue of a bad recording,"This looks like yet another release of a very bad live recording that has been going around being issued in 9 or 10 song format. Please see Red Hot and Live, Respect Yourself, or many other titles with this same track list. This concert had the potential of being great. Etta sounds good and the songs are good, but all of the tracks fade out before the song if finshed. I highly suspect due to the various reissues of this that it may not be a legit recording. Avoid this at all cost."
2,typical star auto-bio...nothing ever her fault...,"I generally do not like to read autobiographies as you know you are only getting one person's view and one with a very vested interest and this book is typical...nothing that has ever happened in Maureen O'Hara's life has been her fault...not her bad choice in husbands, not her money disappearing due to bad choice of financial advisor, etc...in every episode she tells about, she is the heroine and attributes many glowing quotes to herself throughout the book, which may be true, but who is to say?But if you are a big fan, there is no reason not to like the book...it is perfect for fans."
2,Save Your Money,"Reserve from the library instead of buying for your personal collection. Sadly disappointed in her memoir, and it would have been better for Ms. O'Hara to keep her Hollywood secrets to herself. I find it difficult to believe a woman of her intelligence surrendered to the various aspects of her life that were oppressive ie husbands and lack of control involving her finances. Irish Blarney is utmost throughout the pages of this book."
3,'tis herself not quite what was expected,This book was in a little worse shape than I thought it might be. There was a hole in the cover and the pages aren't as tight as they should be.
4,Terrifically researched,A uniquely written book of a true crime story. Capote gathered hordes of information and used it very well. A real event that reads with the suspense of fiction.
1,I never received this product,I ordered this product on the 30th of Dec. It is now 1 Feb and I still have not received my order. I have tried writing several times to the sender and have not gotten any responce. Do yourself a favor and save your money!!!!
5,wonderful book,"It has beautiful painted rocks in it and shows just how easy it is to paint rocks. I am not a real good painter but, I do plan to give it a try. Instructions and ideas in this book are great even for a beginner like me."
1,It does not play!,I ordered this DVD for the playing in the UK but it will not play owing to what is displayed as 'area restrictions'.I am most bitterly disappointed!
2,Outdated Material,"This book is mostly general information. Many of the figures do not identify the wires e.g. hot, neutral, ground. The section on Grounding is many years out of date, and would present an electrical hazard if followed. Most modern homes nowadays use PVC piping thus rendering all this advice on this page useless and dangerous for the layman. Because plumbers use nonconductive material to make connection watertight, using pipes for electrical ground is outright dangerous. Do not use this book because some advice is good, but some is not. Not knowing what advice is the good one may put your life in danger."
5,Does the Job Well...,"If you need a book on Interpreting your mass spectra this is it. Mainly concentrates on electron impact spectra but applicable to other methods. Gets quite involved though, we really only touched the first 4 chapters in any detail in my grad class. It is reasonable easy to read but quite dense, there is more information here than the page count might indicate."
4,Great fun!,"Kids, teens and adults will have fun learning by doing some fun family projects with easy-to-follow and well-illustrated directions to produce several colonial items, including a fishnet, model windmill, candle and a pocket.Projects About Colonial Life would be great for classroom or home study, or for anyone who enjoys learning by doing."
3,"60 minutes of birds, insects, squirrels and fish","This tape has five different scenarios (birds, fish, chipmunks, squirrels and butterflies), each including lots of sound and motion to get your cat's attention. I believe each sequence is repeated once, not that your cat will notice! We have shown this to a bunch of different cats, the indoor cats generally latch on to at least one of the sequences (like butterflies). No one seems to be interested in all of them. Cats that have spent time outdoors may ignore most of it, or perk up when something familiar to their own yard pops up.There's no guarantee your cat will enjoy this, but it's a nice try."
1,NO TEXTS !! NO TRANSLATIONS !!,These are *extremely* obscure early choral pieces by Wagner for which I have just paid Orfeo's more than premium price. Neither texts nor translatios are included. There is virtually no chance of me ever discovering from another source of what the pieces are *about*.AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
3,just a clip,it's just a clip of the flick. i guess it's good as it gives you a little bit of a feel of what the movie may be like? haven't seen the whole movie so don't know.
3,My boys and husbnad LOVE it!!,"I really really hate alien movies...it was quite suspenseful, if you like this type of film!! I did not like the ending, either..."
5,awesome,this model is amazing. i have never seen so much detail put onto a Humvee. It's an amazing car. great color and texture. paint is spot on. and everything works like it should. overall perfect model.
5,Tallis Fantasia-Beautiful,The Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis is one of the most beautiful works ever for string orchestra. Anyone with an inclination towards Ralph Vaughn Williams or just English music would love this piece. The score is easy to read and the 1st and 2nd orchetras and the solo string quartet are easily distinguished.
4,great,Again Nina Bangs writes a great story. my daughter and I have read most of her books and sure enjoy them.
3,Read Other Heyers That Were More Exciting,I got bogged down in this one and the ending was kind of lame. Perhaps my days of being a Georgette Heyer fan are coming to an end.
1,Least favorite Heyer,"Instead of a reformed rake, you have a guy, after only one month's acquaintance, wanting to marry a girl who says she doesn't care if he is reformed from his old ways as long as she is included in any future ""orgies"". Not my idea of a good love story. Heyer has put out some very enjoyable reads, but this one bombed imo. I love the sweeter love stories. This one had an ick factor for me."
5,Wonderful!,"Ah! I wish I could read this anew without knowing what was coming next- and slowly savor the moments. It is a love story through and through. My, oh my- you will have to read it yourself to see what I mean!"
5,wonderful.,"Probably my favorite Georgette Heyer - well, along with The Grand Sophy, Fredrica and Toll Gate. And maybe another or two that I've forgotten.Nice presentation."
3,Love Heyer but Beware HQN Editions!!,"This is no critisicm of Heyer's writing which is just delightful and a significant influence on many current writers across genres. However the copy editing on the HQN editions is so bad that some sections are just unreadable. I was thrilled to see that these classic novels were being reprinted and tried three different titles hoping that I'd just hit a bad exception but in all three of them there were so many misspellings, transpositions, sentences missing or displaced that in places it became a real jigsaw puzzle to try to reconstruct a sensible paragraph out of the gibberish. If anyone reading this review knows someone at the publisher please, please, ask them to hire a competent copy editor for this series!!"
2,Be Careful,"If you are using them outside, all models are not waterproof. If you get them wet it is a $300-$400 repair."
3,not too exact on fit,I had to grind down the guide to fit the saw. It was sticking on part of the saw and wouldn't go all the way in.
5,Great to have when traveling in Rome,"When we travel, we consider the local food and culture a very important part of the experience. We carried the little black book with us always (it's small, so it's very convenient), and found it to be really helpful in finding great local food and dessert and wine places that made our trip that much more interesting and entertaining. The book is organized in a way that makes it easy to find everything while you're walking through the city. I'm glad we brought this book with us."
5,nice starfish studs,Good Quality silver stud earrings. Bought the pendant for my sister. She enjoyed it so much that I ended up buying her the earrings to match (bought myself a pair too!). Eve's Addiction (the seller) were really great in correcting the order when a mistake was made. Would buy from them again.
5,AMAZING!,"Just painted my entire car with this baby. Its easy to use, no need to be a pro!. At this price i didnt expected something this good!!!!The only thing that bothers me a little its the size of the cup......but if you dont mind filling it up....ITS PERFECT!"
5,Looks great,Have not tried it yet. However it is a well finished product with different knobs to adjust flow and spray. Cannister on top is better than on the side specially when you work on tight spots.
5,Best of all the Xserve books purchased!,"I had purchased an Xserve to do audio and video file sharing across our network. I found that most other books (Mac OSX server Essentials and Essential Mac OSX Server Administration) tended to be parroting the help menu in the Xserve and really didn't advance my understanding. But with the Little Black Book I had the server up and sharing files the day the book arrived. This book has everything most people need to know without being unnecessarily complex. Many of the other books constantly referred to the terminal to do functions that are easier to do in the GUI. Unix isn't that incredibly difficult but if I don't have to go there, all the better. If you want to get an Xserver up and going fast, BUY THIS BOOK!"
5,Great product!,"Would recommend. The sound of the stapling action does not bother me. Find it a reliable, high-quality stapler whether stapling 2 pages or greater."
5,Great Stapler!,"I purchased this electric stapler to use on various cardboard/mylar coin holders - and it works great! My traditional stapler just couldn't make it through both sides of the cardboard, but this stapler does it both easily and quickly - and without jamming.Just like many of the other reviewers, I found that it is quite loud when stapling - but I didn't mind, given how powerful it is."
3,Works nicely but really loud,"I bought this stapler for my home office. I often work until 1 AM here. The problem is that our bird room is next door and they're sleeping ( could be your kids too ) and this thing is pretty loud. It sounds like a hammering sound when you use it. I didn't know that these could be this loud, I'd seen someone else using an electric before and it was very quiet, so I just assumed they all were. Not true apparently. But it works fine, so if it doesn't matter, for example if you're in a regular 9-5 office, this could even help you sound busy and industrious, I suppose. I just wouldn't recommend it for a home office where you work late at night and someone may be sleeping nearby."
3,Good stapler,This is a nice and resonably priced electric stapler. I do have two complaints one it is a little louder then I was hoping and the trigger for the staple is to the right of the actual staple punch which makes it vertually imposiable to staple the corner of a sheet at 45%! Other then that I am very happy with this product.
5,GREAT DEAL,"Like this clock very much. With a quick glance not, only can you see the time, but if the alarm is set. Now, just waiting for a power outage, as this was the main reason for the purchase."
2,Defective on arrival,"As others have said, the best thing about this clock is that I was able to see the huge numbers without my glasses. It's also nice that the time is automatically set out of the box. I did find the numbers to be a bit too bright though.The real problem is that on arrival I noticed the numbers on the clock were flickering a bit. Not too badly at first, but definitely noticeable. In the middle of the night, the clock woke me up by making a high pitched whining noise. I pulled the plug and returned it the next day. At least the return was easy, and I bought a different clock that I ended up liking better."
1,Sound the alarm,"I bought two of these Chaney Instruments digital alarm clocks to replace our old ones. The new ones are pretty, have large easily visible numbers and change for daylight saving time easily. Unfortunately the clocks have a serious design flaw.The little vent for the alarm speaker is on the bottom of the clocks. With the clocks setting flat on a night stand the sound of the alarm is so weak it can hardly be heard. Really, it is so anemic I had to hold the clock up to my ear to hear it.In fact, I set my clock to go off this morning as a test. The alarm didn't wake me up. One might think the moron who designed these clocks could have guessed that putting the alarm vent in a spot where it is covered up was not a good idea.I saw some complaints about this problem with a weak alarm sound in the reviews, but thought they might be exaggerated. They weren't. This thing is a dud as an alarm clock. You would be better off buying a rooster. At least you could hear the crowing in the morning."
3,OK if you only want the approximate time. Not accurate.,"I'm a time geek. My watch is a Citizen Eco-Drive Titanium solar powered ""radio"" watch that keeps accurate time to a fraction of a second. I have two ""atomic"" wall clocks that stay synchronized via radio signal. I bought the Chaney as it has nice sized LED numbers and would be perfect for the entertainment center since our new DVR does not have its own clock display. However, it loses about 2 minutes a month and needs to be reset constantly. I emailed the manufacturer and they said that was ""normal"". The clock on my wall oven and microwave are more accurate! If you are happy with knowing ""about"" what time it is, this clock is fine. If you want to know the RIGHT time like me, you'll hate it! I'm giving it to my wife to use in her sewing room."
4,Alarm clock,I brought this clock for the large digital numbers so I can easily see it from by bed. I was also impressed by the brightness of the display.
1,Worthless,I bought this item from UAE and when I recieved the clock it did' work at all. I could return the item but the shipment charges would become more than the product price itself. I usually buy goods from Amazon but this was the first time that it was broken. I am really upset about it because it was a gift for one of my friends and I was realy embarrassed when it did'nt work. I difinitely don't recommend this product to anybody.
2,Alarm is useless to me,"Clock is as advertised and easy to use, unless you use the alarm. The volume of the alarm makes it useless to me and the on/off switch is very tight and hard to manipulate.Addition:After noticing the word (Kitchen) after the description of the clock I reviewed earlier, I looked at the clock described on the Amazon web page that I originally ordered from and realized that the clock I received was a different model than the one I ordered. The picture on Amazon's web page has the controls on the top of the clock and the alarm indicator light on the top left of the face. The clock I received has the controls on the back of the clock and the alarm indicator light on the bottom-right of the clock face. This might account for the too-soft alarm volume on the clock I received, as a kitchen clock would not need the alarm volume that a bedroom alarm would. I don't know if this is just a design change or a different model but something is different."
3,Clock runs slightly fast....,"My clock runs 1.25 seconds per day fast according to my measurements. Not bad, but I like to know what time it *really* is...so after a month, I am > 30 seconds ahead of time - over a minute fast in two months. It might not bother you, but I run a lot of conference calls in my work, and need to start/stop right on the top (or half) of the hour. I'd be satisfied with +/- 1 second per month...but more than that every day? Time for me to find another, more accurate clock."
1,AcuRite is AcuWrong.,"I plugged this clock in and waited 24 hours for it to correct the time shown, which was 4 minutes slow. It never self corrected so I set the correct time from my atomic watch. The clock lost about 1 minute per month. I set the correct time from my atomic watch. It lost about 1 minute per month (rinse and repeat). After several months I looked up the Chaney web site and described the lack of performance by e-mail with no response. I called the support phone # but never spoke to a human being (they were busy handling other's complaints. I saw where I could return the clock for service but they wanted more than 25% of the cost sent with the clock. I decided that it will be cheaper to buy a clock from another manufacturer. I suggest that you do the same."
1,"Hidden ""On-Off"" switch","Clock automatically sets to correct time. Neat. Also very bright LED.But it is difficult to turn off alarm in the morning. The large snooze button works , so if you are a person that hits the snooze button 4 times at seven minute intervals to turn off an alarm, you will like this product.The small on-off switch is on the back of the clock, in the middle of the other button to set the time. This on-off switch is also hard to move.Acurite Customer service confirmed my observations and complaint. It is hard to believe that any one who designed or engineered this product ever used it.I can't recommend this product as an alarm clock. It would be fine as a large letter, see in the dark, non-alarm clock."
2,NOT FOR THE HEAVY SLEEPER,"I bought this product because it came up when I searched for alarm clocks for heavy sleepers, this thing is so quite that it doesn't even began to wake me up. I'm going to return it as soon as possible. The one good thing is that yes you can see the display from a good distance."
1,Poor Quality,"First night worked OK. Second night it, the alram setting was not functional. Also the buttons are TOO HARD to move."
5,Surprised,"I have been a fan of Steve Goodman for years, but I knew him only as a gifted songwriter and recording artist. I now realize that the recordings I have are somewhat sterile and never captured the essence of this guy. He was a truly talented and wonderful performer with amazing energy and imagination. The DVD gets it and you should too!"
3,"Funky enough,but not heavy enough!!","Just picked up Infectious Grooves most recent album Mas Borracho and, I must say, it wasn't what I expected. The thing that made the first three albums so special was the delicate mixture of heavy rockin' riffs and clean guitars, with an explosive, funky bassline!!! Borracho has its moments, but not enough the make it a truly great CD like the others. Previous songs like, ""Do the Sinister"", ""These Freaks are Here To Party"", and ""Why?"" had this classic combination I really miss on this new album. Maybe, after a few more spins through the CD player, I might truly appreciate and love this new sound like the others. It might take some time to get used to, but I'm sure it will grow on me."
3,The good old days weren't always so good.,"Having watched a lot of MMA events, I though it would be neat to watch the early fights of Pride. There are some good matches spread across the five discs, however there are some extremely boring fights in this collection. The early events were 'win or draw' outcomes, with no scoring by judges, so managing to survive 3-5 ten minute rounds was enough to earn a draw. There are some real mismatches (e.g. middle weights against 600+ pounders) and some very technical matches that will only interest the hardcore fan. Overall, its worth the price, if only to hear Bas Rutten and Stephen Quadros complaining about some of the bouts (commentators have gotten better over the years). Buy it, but don't be afraid to fast forward through some of the fights."
3,1 step above the original UFC's,"The first half dozen Pride events are basically one step above the original UFC's... Very far from what MMA is today. Slow action, questionable athletes, freakshow matchups, archaic rules, etc. Simply from a historical perspective these events are interesting, but don't expect to be blown away, or even entertained by most of the fights.They are old and that is to be expected, so I gave them 3 stars, but if you're looking for some entertaining fights, these DVD's are more like 1 or 2 stars."
2,The start of something new...,"I have to admit that it took me a long time to become a Pride FC fan. When I heard of another MMA event outside of the UFC I was very excited... until I actually watched. These early Pride events are in almost every way boring to an extreme seldom seen outside of soccer. There are a couple (literally a couple) of good fights on this collection, but overall this really isn't worth the time or money unless you are a hardcore collector looking for a piece of MMA history. Pride really has come a very long way. If you are used to seeing current Pride events and have not been exposed to these first events, you will more than likely have little to no interest in this collection. Save your time and money for the later Pride events."
4,Not bad.,"Evan Almighty starring Steve Carell is quite touching and funny. Carell turns another impressive performance and Lauren Graham isn't too shabby as well, considering I couldn't stand her character on Gilmore Girls! Morgan Freeman reprises his role as God, this film is much better than Bruce Almighty. This film actually has a story to it rather than Bruce. Evan Almighty is an entertaining take on Noah's Ark. The computer animation is a bit of a let down but this is a great family film."
2,Evan Almight,"Pretty silly. Even the ""effects,"" with the ""flood"" and the ark's and animals' movements, anyhow, are pretty unrealistic and left me wondering ""what's going on???""Nice idea for a plot, etc., but ya gotta use your imagination pretty heftily to fill in the gaps."
4,"Not as good as Bruce Almighty, but well worth the watch","This time Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) who played a small roll in Bruce Almighty get's the chance to have Godly powers. However, he's tortured a little more than Bruce was because he's told to build an ark and his hair keeps growing to look like Moses. No matter what he does he can't stop it from coming back. Even his own family starts to think he's going crazy. Once again Morgan Freeman makes an appearance as a very believable God. This movie is great for kids to watch and you'll love it as well. Once again I want to remind you, the movie is not as good as Bruce Almighty, but you will laugh!"
5,Evan Almighty,I really enjoyed the movie Evan Almighty. I watch it over and over. I recommend this movie to everyone. I love it.
2,NOT NEARLY AS BAD AS I EXPECTED! 2 1/2 STARS!,"When I saw the trailer for this film I thought this was going to be really bad! I liked the first movie 'Bruce Almighty', but thought it wasn't as good as it should have been given the premise and the cartoonish Jim Carrey in the lead. This film is really a harmless family film and that is it's strength. When the story tries to rely on site gags it falls flat, but as a story of a busy Congressman who neglects his family, it works. The outrageous situation in itself is funny enough, without having animal ""doo doo"" joke every few minutes. It's not great by any stretch, but it kept my interest all the way through, probably because I've been too exausted lately to change the channel!:-) It's a nice little movie with some good message and special FX. Lower your expectations and you just might enjoy this."
1,I gained 10 lbs on this program,May your luck be better than mine. I followed this program carefully and put on 10 lbs.
2,"Be warned, I think I've read some of this book before.","Although I did enjoy the layout of this book, I should let you know that a LARGE portion of this book is STRIKINGLY SIMILAR to a book written in 1962 by R.E.L. Masters entitled Eros and Evil. This book does have an extensive bibliography, but somehow Eros and Evil is not mentioned."
1,Junk,I purchased this for use in a classroom. With little use and no abuse it stopped working within a few weeks. Need I say more?
5,nice inexpensive stapler,Good stapler for my employee who has joint issues. It's loud but works well for intermittent use in my small office.
5,Electric Stapler,"So happy with this purchase. I feel like I got the best price and service around, and for a quality product!"
1,Only lasted 3 months,I took a shot and purchased this stapler for work. I use it on a daily basis but never for more that about 10 sheets at a time. It's mostly for 2 sheet staples. It worked great for a while and now it makes the sound like it is stapling but it does not. I have tried only using full strips of staples and that does not help. It's soon going to find itself in the trash!Not worth the money spent!
2,If I had a hammer,"If I had a hammer I'd hammer in the morning.....oh I do have a hammer, it's called a Bostitch Electric stapler! Good grief, it's loud. Everytime I use it, and I have a home office, sounds like I'm hitting my desk with a hammer or maybe a staple gun. Can't stand it. Gave it 2 stars only because it does staple. I'm ordering another brand right now."
2,stanley electric stapler 02210,The stapler is kind of loud when stapling.It also jammed after putting the second row of staples in (not so good).
2,First man yawning......,"This movie is just plain weak. Too bad, because it's based on ""Yojimbo"", a classic that most people won't see because A) it's in black and white and B) ""it's got dem' durn' words at the bottom"". Nevertheless, Bruce was the right actor for the part it's just that Walter Hill's script and direction can't hold a candle to Kurosawa's original or Leones' great remake (Fistful of Dollars). My suggstion; rent either, or both of those movie."
1,"Total rip-off of ""For a Fistful of Dollars""","Watched it 2 days ago and could not believe how much they copied/stole from ""For a Fistful of Dollars."" Just about everything. What a letdown..."
1,"BAD, BAD, BAD","I never, and I repeat: NEVER walk out on a movie, but when this garbage came out in the theater I was out the door in 30 minutes or less, I was glad my tickets were for free. However, MY TIME WAS NOT. It was so stupid and totally off-balance that I have made it personal mission to validate how bad this movie is.If gangster movies is your thing please watch ""The Untouchables"" or something equally cool. Still have it on my list as the top 5 ""so bad that it is bad"" movies of all time. Some movies get the coveted ""So bad that is good"" title...this is not one of them. Garbage."
2,New slant,"Walter Hill is on record as wanting to remake this movie with a new slant. In that he succeeded. He made it dull. That alone is unexpected, because after two great movies you wouldn't have thought it possible. It just goes to show.."
5,Rubik's Cube,Bought them for my grands for Christmas. They love them. I was not to good with solving this puzzle. They will have hours of fun trying to solve the Rubik's cube.
4,Nice to see it still around,Used to play this when it was first introduced. I could never get passed 2 to 3 sides done at once. I'm hoping my son and his friends will play with it and have as much fun as I used to
5,rubix,Very nice. Gave them as gifts and they were awesome. The turning was a little looser then others I have bought but I liked it better.
1,Bait and Switch,"I also received the chinese knockoff '3 level puzzle' (per the box), not a true rubik's cube, quality was very low. I contacted the vendor for a return and, to their credit, an authentic rubik's cube arrived at my door less than 24 hours later! Some of the decals on the squares are misaligned, so even the authentic cube doesn't quite pass the sniff test. I appreciate the effort to make things right, but I won't trust this vendor again."
4,Queen,"The Queen and I is a real movie which is showing and saying the aspects of the queen about how revolution happened and the results.The movie is very close to reality,it showed the personality and character of Queen Farah."
4,"Not just for ""teens""","I have always loved fantasy horror.... vampires, werewolves, ghosts....the horror genre that does NOT involve chopping people up, eating them or anything that could actually happen in this crazy world! Finding new material directed at the older generation is difficult since we are supposed to outgrow these tastes, I suppose in favor of more sophisticated material (reality shows?). The odd time a truly well done adult series is picked up, it rarely lasts (The Firm, Missing, Firefly...)I almost never tried this series because of the title ""TEEN Wolf"". And the main characters ARE teenagers but with several interesting adult characters thrown in for good measure. The script is clever, the special effects are wonderful and I found the whole package very entertaining."
3,Still waiting,Have not received it yet and I knew it was not going to be out for sale for sometime. I just didn't know how long and it has been since Christmas and still no movie!
4,teen wolf,"Good show. It sometimes gets to where in the storyline you're like ""come on!, really?"" But, it's entertaining and good for people like me who are a little tired of vampire shows with no other supernatural beings but them."
5,teenwolf episodes,I love the show and all its actors and I am so looking to season 3. On a scale form 1 To 100 I would have to give 100. I wish them all the best of luck and hope they come back alot more after season 3.
5,SWAY NOT,Fantastic product. It made a big difference towing my 27 foot travel trailer. I use a GMC Sierra 1500 with the 5.3 engine. I have added air bags to the rear to help but was getting allot of sway before I added the controller bar.The price is well worth the strain it saves on my arms and nerves.
3,good movie,"i bought this movie for $4.99 and it was a good deal because its a good movie.the european accents that some of the characters have are cheesy but the humor and the action make up for that. i recomend you buy it but if u want at a cheaper price do some searching, u can find these movies in the least expected place."
4,"Easy to follow, splendid jazz training system","As a former dancer, now teacher and choreographer, I have been dancing and teaching Luigi's style for many years(without reading his book). I was taught by an amarican dancer, so when I recently read the book, I was surprised how well known the exercises and not less Luigi's philosophy was to me. The book is a perfect way to learn jazz, diff. steps (lots of small photographs) and not to forget his brilliant idea:""take the barre with you"" out on the floor. The most complete jazz system I've ever trained.The book is easy read, easy to follow even for beginners, and not to forget - a perfect way to get strong,long and smooth muscles. I can only recommend the book - a fine supplement to related books and videos."
2,So - So,"These are comfortable (3 diff sizes cover), sound great and a decent price. However, after receiving these in early June, it's the end of July and the connection to the plug is failing. The right side bud only works when the connection is in just the right spot.Over all, a comfortable bud with very good sound and poor quality."
3,Comfortable but wires to thin,I thought these were pretty comfortable but after only 2 months the wires have developed a short and don't work consistently. I think that Griffin used to small a gage wire. The wire for these headphones is much lighter gage than the Apple headphones. I'm looking for a heavier/more durable set now that is a comfortable as these.
1,Sound quality very poor.,I found the sound quality from these earphones to be worse than the earphones that came with my ipod. I'd agree with another reviewer that they sounded muffled. If I could return them I would but I have opened them so no luck.
3,"Good sound, great comfort, but bad quality (wires)","The ear phones are really good in terms of quality of sound and are really comfortable. I can use them all through the day and can just keep them on unlike the hard ones. The buds are soft enough to comfortably fit your ear, especially with the 3 sets of additional buds. The case is pretty neat to keep it safely.My only problem with the product was with the wires. They were not long enough for me to keep my player in my jean pocket. The wires on one side came off and stopped working in less than 6 months, despite me using the case to store them safely!Anyway, good buy for the price and pretty quick delivery. Hope that helps!"
2,NOT VERY USEFUL,"Allan Holdsworth is a great guitar player, but this book is a really disappointment.Someone who knows some music theory do notneed this book.A lot of chords shown in this book are also not practically used.Learning these chords are waste of time."
4,Drakness and truth,"Noir is in many ways like Evangelion. It's dramatic, has a startling plot with amazing charectors. in the end it shows you the world a whole different way and you think of things differently as well. Watch it!"
4,Unraveling slowly...,"This is the 2nd DVD of the Noir series, with four complete episodes.As expected, the story is unraveled slowly as the series progresses. We are given 4 very good episodes here, and I loved the 2 parter.This is the same Noir that you saw in the first volume, with all of the style intact. Unfortunately, the repeated flashbacks are also intact, and for that I must doc 1 star.Still, this is a great series for the spy/action crowd."
5,colt pocket '49: its evolution including the baby dragoon and wells fargo,Excellent reference book for Colt Pocket Model enthusiasts.It allows research at home.Ideal for confirming origins etc and variations of various models.i regard this as an essential works for collectors.
2,Palm heater,"This glove is just a palm heater, the problem I have in the cold are frozen fingers. The Size D battery is bulky and a health hazard if your hand goes flying near your head."
2,Wore out my Second One,"I'm on my second one of these. I do a lot of stapling at work. My first one wore out in about a year or two, and I thought well I had a lemon. So I bought another one and now it's doing the same thing. It gets jammed and has a week staple sound. I've got them unjammed, but it's like the spring has broken and it won't work anymore.I do love the way it staples -- I have no problem with that at all. It's just shouldn't it last more than a couple of years?I will look for a better quality one."
3,#2 OF THE BIG BAD WOLFE's,"The best part of this book is the cover [model probably should have represented brother, Cameron]Hey guys, where are the blue eyes? almost blonde hair?Eric Wolfe is another very good representative of the male of the species. Tina Kranas may be a decent female but the story is not strong enough.The envolvement has to be fast paced for a short story but good grief - the threat is not strong enough nor is Eric's determination to catch the drug dealers.This series is appearing to be a very light read -- not bad but nothing to recommend it except the last page of the fourth book.Ah well, onto the next one ----"
4,American Film Inst Frank Capra,I enjoyed watching this VHS and i was happy with the arrival of this item i would view other items in the series
4,Get what you pay for,"This coin holder is exactly what I expected after reading the other reviews. Taking the advice of the other buyers, I superglued the two pieces together to ensure the coin holder did not break in 2. It works great and is a good size to fit where ever you need."
2,only half good,Holds coins yes. Has no way to attach it to anything. Front and back is the same and the shape wont allow for cup holder spot. Where would you put it? Still looking for a good coin holder.
2,All the plot developments were not unexpected,"This is the first time I read a book by Dorothy Gilman's book. I was a bit disappointed, because my Japanese review book says it is a very funny spy story and Amazon.com average customer review rates it 5 stars. It was funny, but not so much. I thought the story was too old-fashioned. Unfortunately all the plot developments were not unexpected before I had finished to read it."
3,"Ok ending, a little silly but still decent","After months of waiting, I finally got to see the end of this series. I have to admit that while I liked the ending, a few things did leave me going ""oh please... that's farfetched even for THIS anime"". The jig is finally up for Hibiki in this volume & he's forced to come clean to everyone. Understandably, everyone is pretty upset about this, especially considering that the male Hibiki's already been labeled as a pervert by so many different people. Not to worry, as a suitably happy enough ending is in order. (It's not quite what you'd expect, though.)There were a few things that kind of had me shaking my head, though. The biggest thing was what caused the Principal to become such a man hater to begin with & Lulu's implied role in the matter. (spoilers in the comments section) Even so, this anime is decent enough to where most fans will be able to enjoy it. It's not a particularly deep series, but it's never really ever portrayed itself as such.3.5/4"
2,It showed up BENT!!!,I had broken one key on my laptop. The sites i found where you could order just one key cost like [...] bucks. I decided just to order a whole new keyboard. The keyboard showed up at my house very quickly. The box was bent so i opened it and the keyboard was also bent!!! a whole side of it was bent downward. I took the keyboard to a friend asking if i should return it or if it could be bent back into place. He bent the keyboard back into place and replaced it with the old one. There is a raised spot from where it was bent (which i can deal with) but i recommend that if you have this problem you should return it. The keyboard fit just fine but i was not happy with the way the package was handled during shipping. I have no idea how it would get bent!
5,Good game!,"I just got the game today even though I have been meaning to get it before. I like anti-terrorist game and this one delivers! It has beautiful graphics and fast-paced action. The only thing I don't like is music, kinda anoying but you can turn it off. I gave it 5 stars nevertheless. It's worth the money that's for sure."
5,"Accurate, Accurate, Accurate","As I said before, it is accurate. This book will inspire your faith. It will teach you a lot about the man known as Jesus Christ."
3,a video that makes one want to read the book!,"Although I'm not an Allende fan, the viewer appreciates Chilean intelligentsia from her point of view. What avenues are open to challenge a military dictatorship? Banderas does OK--but the best actors are the supporting characters!"
1,Not Worth the Money,"My son had one of these toys from his grandmother that broke within 20 minutes. He thought that it was because it was accidentally thrown on the pavement beside the pool. He enjoyed playing with it, so I bought him another one. This one broke within 5 minutes of playing with it in the pool. It was too quiet to hear and didn't work properly at all. It's definitely not worth paying any amount of money for!"
1,My Version is Defective,The clock arrived with nearly a dead battery. The alarm would not sound at all so I replaced the battery. The clock now gains more than 15 minutes every hour making it absolutely useless. The name on the clock is Acurite as shown on the photo of this object.
3,worth reading but ...,"To really enjoy these selections which are well done, one has to really enjoy the writings of Thomas Jefferson and there are others of the Founding Fathers I prefer to read, namely The Federalist Papers, of Jay, Hamilton and Madison. It is a matter of personal preference. The fault here lies with me."
3,Just OK,"Swords and sorcerers, three hotties. Weak story. Protagonist is thin. Not worth driving out of your way."
5,Two More Great Garland Shows!,"Of course I haven't seen this title yet -- as it has yet to be released -- but the manufacturer's web site indicates this DVD will include shows #11 (with Steve Allen, Mel Torme, Jayne Meadows) and #14 (with Bobby Darin, Bob Newhart). Having seen both of these shows from average quality collectors' videotapes, these will be most welcome in the outstanding picture and sound as represented by prior releases in this series.Highlights include Judy's renditions of ""Here's That Rainy Day"", ""The Party's Over"" (w/Torme), ""Through The Years"", a medley with Bobby Darin and ""More"""
4,One of the best modern Sci-Fi books I've read....,"It's very sad that this excellent book is out of print. Though the ending is a bit week, the story, and the story within the story (and even the story within the story within the story - you've got to read it to understand: it's quite complex) is not only very creative, but gripping as well. Steele has since changed his style significantly - so much so that his more recent work is all published under the pseudonym Gherbod Fleming."
1,Don't even bother with this model...,"This model (at least the one I purchased!) is a piece of junk. I've never had a stapler jam so frequently and be such a pain to fix once it is jammed. I love Swingline in general, but this particular model in my case was just not a wise purchase. Swingline Ergonomic High Capacity Desk Stapler (S7077701F)is a much better choice. That one has been fault free for me."
5,Great looking clock,Love this good looking clock until it got dropped 2 times. Time for a new one. It is a bit unusual looking.
1,God awful video,This has to be the worst instructional video I have ever seen.I don't even know where to start this video is so bad.1. The dancing in these videos are horrible.2. The man is hard to understand when he speaks.3. The females look awkward and uncomfortable when they dance.4. The casio keyboard music is really corny.These people have some nerve selling something so horrible.I recommend Juan and Diane's NY videos. Actually I recommend any video more than this one.
5,A firm and protective piece of plastic,"What can you say about a firm piece of protective plastic that you put on the floor?It's firm, it's plastic, and it very protective of our soft pine floors.I have been using this firm piece of protective plastic for over a year...it remains as firm and protective as the day I bought it.So if you're in the market for a firm piece of protective plastic that you put on the floor...well, buy this one.It came as most all products do these days well packaged and on time."
3,"Nice item, generally up to my expectations, but ...","Very nice pair of chairs, well-constructed and well-made. Definitely nicer than the majority of outdoor furniture items at the local home improvement store. But ....1) They should be shipping for 1-cent. I contacted folks at Amazon wrt to the error on the product page and received no reply. I later contacted a CSR and was told that I was checking out incorrectly (which is incorrect), but they would make a one-time exception to my error. Lovely. The item is not ringing 1-penny shipping like others in the collection. It is Amazon's error, and they are not correcting it even though I contacted them twice about the matter.2) The chairs are absolutely filthy. Not just a little, a lot. I sprayed them down with a pressure hose and that was not enough to clean them. The next step was an old-fashioned scrub brush with soap and water. That did a much better job, but if a third time does not work they will have to go back due to my allergies."
1,Not very helpful,"This book was not helpful for me when I began to learn to drive (at 30+) and was very nervous about driving. It is written mostly for old drivers, it's not very well organized, and too wordy. It teaches driving skills from beginning, but when I tried to follow instructions for such a basic skill like turning, I just drowned in details and get confused.The books which I found helpful for learning to drive wereParent-Teen Manual for Learning to DriveandCrash-Proof Your Kids.And about a fear of driving - the more you practice the less anxious you become, but begin slowly. First, practice with helper in empty parking lot. Then, try some short distance driving with helper (local library, local store with ample parking space). Then, when you feel ready try it alone. After mastering one route try another one the same way. Gradually you'll become more confident and comfortable behind the wheel and actually begin to enjoy driving. :)"
5,Excellent watch,"This watch is a great buy, with fine quality. There are fewer slim watches on the market nowadays, so this was a real find. Looks good and has Seiko's reliable mechanism."
4,It's about time Statistician speak out,"I originaly bought this for my son (in college on the mainland) based on an article I read in the sunday paper. When I saw it in the library I decided to pick it up and see if the book was any good. Well I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this was a very worthy book. After all how many people would ever consider a Statistician's opinion, well this is one time where you should. If you kind of want a good preview about this author and his subject go to TED (Technology, Entertainment, and Design), there he presents his research and findings to the yearly TED think tank."
2,"Great theme, horrible execution","The idea of an economic analysis of the quotidian bits of life is a great one; and it is easy to understand why Levitt is as highly regarded as he is. Unfortunately, this book is such a complete mismash of stylistic inconsistency, vague writing and studious avoidance of detail that it undermines itself.The book's theme seems to be that the economic toolkit is well suited to assessing (and debunking if appropriate) the conventional wisdom. But instead of actually seeing the economist's toolkit put to use, we are given a list of conclusions.The book is shallow -- and doesn't add much to the profile of Levitt that was in the NY Times Magazine a couple of years ago.Rather than reading this book, go to Levitt's U of Chicago homepage and read the papers that he has posted there."
3,over rated,This book will make you think but doesn't answer any of its own questions. Very little data or facts are used to back up conclusions. It probably should have been called poponomics
4,Fun and Interesting,This book is a FABULOUS read! It is written for the rest of us who know NOTHING about economics. This is not your fathers Econ 101 text!Steven has a great knack for putting econ stats to interesting real life scenarios. Its fun to read and certainly makes you take a different look at the people around you.You'll love it!
3,"Entertaining, thought-provoking, and lacking scientific rigor","While I wouldn't go so far as to relegate the book to one-star status, I completely agree some of the objections on here. I'm halfway through the book right now, and I've been repeatedly troubled with the authors' tendency to reach qualitative conclusions that go beyond their data.That said, it's still an entertaining book. Reading it with a critical mind, questioning the authors' methods and conclusions, helps you sharpen your own understanding of statistics, causation and correlation, etc. I'm happy to have read it (well, half so far)."
3,A Lot of Money for Not Much Content,"My second book of 2006 and it was sort of a disappointment. Everyone around me has been reading it, I asked for it for Christmas and was thrilled to get it. But it is so padded...I kept saying, OK, OK, it is so obvious that you are trying to make a few columns into a book! Still, it has some great insights and the chapter about drug dealers living with their mothers and making a mimimum wage makes it all worth it. I also loved the last chapter about baby names (finally I understand where all these ""Britneys"" and ""Ashleys"" are coming from). I'd say this is a good intro to economics for people who are interested in it. I liked it in college and I wish my teacher at the time told the kinds of stories in this book."
3,Freakview: A Amateurish Reader Explains a Different Points of View,"The insights presented from Freakonomics are novel and intriguing. Those cited facts and unique point of views are great materials for magazine articles. However, elabrated as a 400+ pages book, I feel there is a lack of profound and excited elements to captivate the readers. That may explain why I falled into sleep while reading it."
4,Still Relevant,"I am a bit late in reading this presentation of statistical daisy-chains, but I believe it is worth a read beyond being 'current' on hip business books. My principal take-away from Freakonomics is the reminder that causality of behavior or outcome is not on a one-to-one ratio with inputs. This of course means that if you have a unique understanding (or narrowly held understanding) of some dynamic in your company's market, it can be exploited in ways that are atypical and can drive disproportionate returns. Its helpful to occasionally read this sort of perspective changer, regardless of publishing date."
4,"Which is more dangerous ,reading Freakonomics or not reading it?","Which is more dangerous ,reading Freakonomics or not reading it?the book is about the power of information .Collecting data is one thing and analyizing them is another thing.not a difficult-read .I loved it"
2,Snoozorama,"A blurb on the cover of this book says ""Prepare to be dazzled"" -- so, being an ex-Boy Scout, I brushed my choppers, took a multivitamin, and hired a sitter for the cat before settling in for the night with a copy of ""Freakonomics"". After all, a book that promises to ""explore the hidden side of everything"" sounds intriguing as all get out, and I couldn't wait to dig in and ""be dazzled"". Unfortunately, after reading this slim volume (Q: Can ""the hidden side of everything"" be explored in 256 pages? A: I don't believe so.), I simply wasn't dazzled. Maybe it's just that I didn't find the fact that real estate agents, on average, tend to put more effort into selling their own homes than they do that of their clients; or that rich people are more likely to name their daughter ""Ava"" rather than ""Brittany"". I'm sorry, but that stuff just isn't dazzling."
4,Smart and off the beaten path,"Good book, especially for a minimal price. If you like an odd way to look at economics this book gives a fun portrayal of that very thing. Not a bad read, but if your looking for a story, this is not it."
4,A Great Read,"Thought provoking, entertaining and intelligently written! Lays bare the hard statistical evidence behind many common assumptions that the 'Spin Doctors' (main stream media and politicians) distort and misrepresent to support their own agendas. The book digs into some highly controversial topics, for example; What's really more dangerous to your family? Owning a gun, or a backyard swimming pool? (The answer is obvious right?) Or, what's the real reason for the decline of crime in the U.S.?Any way, a great book and I plan to read it a second time!"
3,Overrated,"This book was a quick, fairly interesting read, but I can't understand why it's been so popular. The major idea the authors propose (the one about abortion) is still under contention. Their other points are very slight or obvious: real estate agents work harder to sell their property than when they sell yours - wow, who would have thought? Popular names follow fashion, race and social class - is that why I called my youngest Joseph and not Tyrone? People who sell crack on street corners don't actually earn much money - what insight!If you want a book to occupy your mind when on a short flight, this is OK, but don't expect too much."
4,An Entertaining Read,I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It is as entertaining as it is informative. A great book to read in many sittings.
3,Pretty good,"Freakonomics' strongest asset is its blunt force mauling of conventional wisdom and the often unveering faith that journalists, experts and ordinary folks pay it, often only to serve (sadly) their own interests. When that is the authors' approach they deliver sound arguments. That, thankfully, is the core premise of the book.While it is too piecemeal, and cute, to be called boring, the breathless exploration of the economist's actual findings at times borders on the mundane. Much of his intesive number-crunching about teacher cheating, Sumo wrestling and (especially!) baby names and various parenting fallacies can only be considered redundant to the observant reader.People like me (who aren't economists and who aren't familiar with the calculus of demographics and sociology) should read this book mainly because it's fairly fresh, witty and is a good example of hunting up the truth while ignoring distracting conventions, moral or otherwise."
2,Libertarian Review,"Some information but for the most part boring and politically correct. The author skillfully avoids the correlation between IQ, race and educational results. There is enough of that in the lame stream media. I do not want to pay for a book and have reality papered over in feel good manipulation of statistics."
2,Largely Overhyped!,"Nothing new in here, people. Yes, we know everyone hopes to cut corners, lie, cheat and steal. Blah, blah, blah."
2,Don't Believe The Hype,"This is another case of a book becoming immensely popular due to good editorial reviews and word of mouth. Unfortunately, Freakonomics couldn't match the hype in my opinion. While the concept of giving economics a new platform for analysis was interesting, the book did not come through with enough examples. Would have enjoyed more concise and abundant real world examples of Freakonomics in action."
4,amusing book,I'm going to go ahead and add to the heap of praise this book has accrued. Worth reading just for the part on upper and lower class names.Ivan Rorick
2,Great for those who like to look at the outside of the box!,"If you like logical thinking, and you like to apply it to things other than math, you will really enjoy this book. It does a great job of objectively reviewing & investigating problems, from names given to low-income children to teachers' cheating on standardized tests. The author is not unsympathetic, but he is unsentimental, which is a refreshing treatment for some of the older problems for which he offers help. It was a breath of fresh air for me, as I am fast becoming a very cynical news watcher. Thanks to the author for being able to set aside prejudice of all kinds and suggest new ways to deal with stale problems!"
5,Wonderful Book,"I am an economics student and found this book to be fantastic. However, you definitely don't need to have any knowledge of economics to enjoy it. It is insightful, amusing, and creative. If you are interested in hearing explanations for why people act as they do you will love this book."
4,Interesting reading,"Interesting facts and analysis. Written in a way you can understand. Would've like to see more chapters and more ideas, book was too short!"
3,Well worth a read,"The book serves a useful function: to promote the use of economics in thinking about everyday social problems. With that in mind, the book ultimately succeeds. It is a bit scatterbrained, and a few chapters, especially the one on cheating, were not very interesting."
3,Minus for the layout,"Good cover but bad layout. It is not very accesible to just grab the book and read one chapter or a part, it was difficult to turn the pages and you were never sure if you took one page ore many.Other than that the book was higly amusing."
1,Hype-onomics,"Okay, it's interesting enough, not a bad read, some compelling ideas, but this has got to be the most self-congratulatory book ever. It's about a brilliant ""noetic butterfly"" (really, that's the smooch the author gives the economist) who shocks the establlishment, and the brilliant journalist who gains his trust and respect, and then the brilliant journalist quotes his own brilliant articles about the brilliant economist and calls that a book. It's a little insulting how we're supposed to be blown away by these mavericks. I'll give them credit for making science sexy, for making economics and statistics seem like valid tools, but please, fellas, a little humility, a little less marketing, and, if you really need to make out this much, get a room."
4,Worth it!,"Highly recommend it. Very funny, eye opening and just makes you think differently... To consider another perspective. I hope the authors work together again!"
2,Save your money,"The book encourages us to question the conventional thinking. "" All it reguires is a novel way of looking, of discerning, of measuring."" Well here goes. The book cost about $17 a copy for 204 pages. That is over 8 cents a page. The last chapter contained over 12 pages, two columns per page, of girls and boys names, certainly makes me question how it made the best seller list."
3,Bombast,"The book does a good job of using a misleading title to represent a few writeups of several research projects, the results of which could have been provided in a few pages. The author is also grandly represented, which lacks the grace of humility. All in all, too much about too little."
2,OK...,"This book contains some interesting information, but it is blandly presented with mediocre writing... I would much rather read something from Gladwell or Sowell."
2,Dumb Science?,"The fact that this book is actually in the New York Times Bestsellers top 10 gives us an insight on the quality of the readers in America. The book is at its best slightly funny and simple to read; but fails miserably to deliver a true, solid knowledge to the readers.Just another book in the long list of pseudoscience bestsellers..."
4,"It's like reading The Economist, but on steroids.","Freakonomics are basically a fun, fresh perspective in using data and economics techniques to look at our socieites.However, one word of caution: the fact is that our human societies ain't pretty. If you are saddened once in a while by reading the tough, raw, aweful facts as seen in the magazine ""Economist"", you will be choked full of these ""insights"" from Freakonomics.In short, this is dense, blunt, stuff. But oftentimes informational and entertainig if you have my word of caution! :D"
2,"Levitt is interesting, the author is not","I read this book, and the parts that had to do with the actual research and findings of Levitt are very interesting. But the author adds too much of his own gobbaldygoop.The chapter on how well children do in school and the parameters of thier parents is good. It was based on research. But so much of this book is filled with the authors inane opinions, and observations passed off as Levitts. There are many things that are not just illogical, but he contradicts himself at least three time. It really does not do credit to Levitt and his work.And what does this guy have against realitors, I mean we got your point the first time, but he just keeps going for the throat. People may disagree, but I really do think that he compares realitors to the KKK. I could be wrong."
5,Awesome Book,"This is by far one of the best books I have read. I love being challenged to think on my own, and that is what this book makes you do. There are little questions through out the book to challenge you to apply your own logic and then the authors supply their reasoning. The topics were contraversial, but I admire that the authors used that material; It made the book more interesting and suprised me to see how basic statistics can be used in the real world, even on unquantifiable properties, like culture.Really, the worst part about the book is that the ending comes too soon. I wish there were another 200 pages or another book on its way."
2,"Sorry, But I Don't Agree","All the hype by reviewers about how ""different"" and insightful this book was prompted me to buy a copy. I found it totally disappointing as a book on economics or related to economics. It was in fact interesting and amusing in places, but the book is based on a different social science altogether -- Sociology.Many other books have been written about social groups and relationships, and this is just another one. The organizational structure of the drug industry and the popularity of particular names for children are perhaps interesting but not something that need to be included under the umbrella of economics.Sorry, but I wouldn't have bought it if I had skimmed it in my local book store."
1,Interesting reading but far from a work of science,"No matter what the subject the author manages to pull a conclusion out of the data, often using his own ideas.While some of his work seems excellent, the praise went to his head and now he knows it all. Buy it used, so you won't feel like you wasted your money."
4,Freakonomics review,Very interesting interpretations of selected statistics. Frequently supporting conclusions through multiple data sources and by asking insightful questions. A very easy and thought-provoking read. The only downside was that I would have loved to have seen more topics addressed.
2,Prepare to be dazzled?????,"That's what the cover said....I say be prepared to be disappointed. The book was at best, boring, with nothing intriguing or dazzling about it. I like books about social trends, but this book didn't tell me anything new, and I doubt it will tell you anything you haven't already figured out. It is grueling going through the statistics waiting for the dazzling part, which doesn't come. Don't bother with it. I'm returning mine. (I think I've returned maybe five books in 30 + years of book buying...) Forget it."
3,Not sure what to make of this book!,"The book itself is not a bad read. However, I felt like it didn't fulfill all its promise. Well, actually the book does; the expectations set by other reviewers are too elevated.You see the book itself states that it's not about a single topic. It's true. The book is not about a single topic. It takes trivial matters and dissects them using some analysis which he never explains but; oh well it's not really a book about teaching analysis methods anyways, right? It does go to the point that finding the few important items that separate data is not a trivial matter but it's worth the time to do so.It is a light read and quite entertaining. I would've given 3 and a half stars but had to keep it to three."
3,"Fun read, not always analytically rigorous","The guy is smart. No argument about that. He also has a gift for analyzing data and turning his analysis into a good story. What I'm not sure he is good at, though, is looking to see whether the data plausibly supports more than one story. (Hint: there are usually at least two sides to a story.)"
5,Great read,"This book is one of the best I have read in a couple years. They present things in ways that I have never thought of. It's really great to read a book that makes you see things differently. Also, they have well documented citations of their statistics. Great read all around."
4,Fascinating!,"I loved this book. Some of the things politicians have taken credit for are not necessarily what they seem. If you are obsessed with ""But why?"" type of questions, you'll like this."
5,Fun Facts,"I found this book to be enjoyable and informative. Kind of a trivia by the numbers. Most importantly however, is I felt the author did a good job of indirectly illustrating the point that those with a political agenda to promote or advance will not be deterred by facts."
5,The most stimulating intro to economics,"Freakish theories that are too taboo (and lack funding) for dry academics to look at, are wittily presented with some very interesting conclusions.An excellent read for anyone that wants a more real-life exposure to economics (though be warned that the main focus is really statistics and sociology). Very entertaining!"
4,Provocative thoughts,"The two authors eloquently takes the reader through a series of arguments relating seemingly non related issues to eachother (sumo wrestlers and school teachers for example) and present a new view on those by using an economists approach.It is a great book to get a new view and argumentation on abortion, crime and parenting, although some readers should be prepared that some views are quite provocative, but nonetheless exiting."
4,"Provocative, eye opening","There are some very thought provoking ideas presented here and you don't have to agree with them to find ""Freakonomics"" valuable. Steven Levitt presents some interesting facts that will make you want to research further. Reading his take on the public school system was validating as it has been my opinion all along. Seeing first hand how standardized testing preparation has been substituted for a real education and then reading how all it really does is encourage cheating was powerfully illuminating. The abortion statistics and the ridiculous baby naming trends offered valuable insight.I see this as a primer on sociology more than economics but it does show how it is all related. I will pass this one around because I think it is an important read. Maybe not for all the information included but for how it opens your mind and makes you want to look further. I enjoyed ""Freakonomics"" and recommend it."
3,"Kinda cool, makes you curious, good for impressing your friends.","Freakonomics is filled with kinda-cool-stuff-to-know. Like I've always wanted to know why drug dealers live with their moms. And now I know.Anyway, you'll leave this book with an insatiable curiosity about the questions of life AND good conversation material to impress your friends.To be honest, though, I didn't think this book was that cool. Read it if you're really bored."
3,A bit dissapointing,"Levitt analyzes the claims of different sides in recent arguments about social phenomena. He takes a close look at proposed solutions to or purported reasons of social problems. He does not care whether these claims make sense at first blush, he tries to see if there are well-designed statistical studies backing them. Hence, he provides some real gems of information. However, if you are the type who follow the news more or less closely, a good amount of the material will not come across as new, such as the effect of legalized abortion on crime rates. At some points I thought the author has repeated himself a bit too much as well. However, it is still a well-thought-out and easy-to-read book."
1,Hugely disappointing - should be called weakonomics,"I'll caveat my review by acknowledging I couldn't make it past the 3rd chapter. Based on the reviews, I was hoping to be wowed, and I was. As in ""Wow, this book stinks"". It read like the author thought he was unveiling some kind of economic revelation by tying two totally unrelated things together, but in the end I couldn't help thinking ""Who cares?"" Reading it was like being stuck at a cocktail party cornered by some know it all drunk. After three chapters I cut my losses and chucked in the trash. I now feel guilty for playing a part in a wasted tree."
4,Surprisingly interesting,I have a new appreciation for the hidden side of economics! It read so quickly. Who knew economics could be a fun read!
1,Book had bad odor and was damaged - Seller is VERY misleading!,"The seller described the book to be in ""Very Good"" condition, but upon receiving the book, there were crayon scribbles on the book. I did not mind the writing on the book and I would kept it if not for the fact that the book was giving off a really unpleasant odor--the book smelled like stale cheese and mold! I am very dissatisfied with this product and really angry at this seller for their misleading descriptions."
5,interesting!,"Having just readPersonal Best - How Ordinary People Achieve Extraordinary Success and How You Can Too,I was keen to read this book to keep the momentum going . I have read many books on personal finance and wealth building, but this one by Stephen J. Dubneris really good. This is an excellent book about economics. Most economics book are dry and stuffy expositions of the ""dismal"" science. This book answers microeconomic questions like Why do most drug dealers live with their mothers? There is interesting stuff in here that you will not find anywhere else. I highly recommend this book."
3,freakonomics economics,"Freakonomics was a great book that shares insight into how things that you would expect to not fit together, like schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers, actually have a lot in common. The book shows different correlations between unlikely things. It is a book on economics and shows the correlations in a easy way to understand and see how the world is changing."
4,Entertaining,"Entertaining and insightful. Don't agree on his conclusions about abortion legalization lowering crime rates (he's been discredited by many on this), but a lot of interesting info here."
3,Interesting Concept but Repetitive,"This book introduces interesting concepts on economics and simple examples of how it affects the real world. The best part of this book is the fact that the author's style makes the reader think in strange ways to understand the concept presented. The main downside of this book is that too much repitition is used to simplify what the author is trying to get across. Overall, although exceptionally written, this book was not meant to have mass appeal, and it shows."
3,Reads Like Newsweek,"The book is apparently well researched, but there were no data (just summary information) provided to verify the conclusions. The writing style is more like a newspaper article than a scientific paper. Maybe this is ok, but it doesn't make me believe the conclusions."
2,Not economics,There's a reason people who don't normally care about economics like this book. It's not an economics book. It is much more sociology than economics and that is a much more interesting subject for most people. I agree with many of the reviews that describe this book as an overextended magazine article. Don't waste your time.
3,Mish-Mash,"The best parts of this book were the ones that dealt with more unusual subject matter like cheating in sumo-wrestling and the economics of dealing crack cocaine.The other parts, the ones dealing with crime and public education, were fairly pedestrian, I thought. I am a nonprofessional but diligent reader of politics and social policy and I didn't think Levitt wrote like some crazy rogue economist with stunning insight, as promised. He merely sounded educated.If he had stuck to wacky subject matter throughout the book, I probably would have given this four or five stars. Or, if he had not been marketed as some crazy man who was going to blow my mind, I might have given this book four or five stars for being a readable essay on social policy, its promoters, and its critics. Instead, I think this book is too much of a mish-mash of the exciting and the dull."
3,Recent trend would indicate the conclusion is wrong,"FBI data indicates that the US Crime Rate is up in 2006.[...]Wikipedia data entry ""the number of abortion in the US"" shows the abortion number to be steady in the US from 1981-1991 at about 1.6 million. Slight decrease from 91-93 to 1.5 million and another slight decrease from 93-97 to less than 1.4 million.[...]If the numbers are correct and the crime increase trend is not a short-term occurance, I would have to say the authors have drawn the wrong conclusion. Unless the crimes were committed by that 100,000 decrease in abortion and the criminals are between the ages of 12-14 years old.For an economic book, the book didn't seem to contain any useful and practical knowledge. However, it is an interesting and easy reading. Wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it now that I have read it."
4,Fascinating and Highly Readable,"I avoided reading Freakonomics because I thought I had little interest in math or economics. After two family members raved about it I finally decided to give it a shot and it hooked me in the first chapter. Simply put, this book amazed me. The topics are interesting and the authors wrote the book in an easy to read manner. They took economic theories and put them in layman's terms. I never knew that statistics and economics could be so exciting. Freakonomics is a must read."
3,Fresh thinking,"Levitt is an economist who thinks outside the box. In this book, he spins some oddball ideas: how legal abortion reduces crime, how swimming pools are more dangerous than guns, the effect of ""black"" names for the future of the children and so on. He applies economist thinking to various subjects, often with fairly fresh results.While he does provoke some thoughts and the New York Times journalist Dubner has written a pretty good book, somehow this doesn't entertain me quite as well as Malcolm Gladwell's books. Part of it must be the way Dubner praises Levitt in between the chapters - at least to a Finnish reader, those parts are just too egoist.Still, Freakonomics is a hit book for a reason, and while I wouldn't suggest buying it - it's very much read and forget - reading the book isn't a waste of your time (besides, it's a really quick read), but may instead provoke some actual thinking and cause you to take new looks at old things. That's always good!"
3,"Great book, but do not buy if you have already purchased the original version.","I loved the original version of Freakonomics and I highly recommend that book. This ""revised and expanded"" edition is really neither. The authors have simply added a section containing articles that were previously published in The New York Times Magazine. There is no ""new"" material. This being the case, I feel that this version has been misrepresented. If you have not yet read the original, then I recommend buying this book. The additional articles are a nice bonus. If you already have the original version of this book, as I do, then I don't think it's worth the money to purchase this edition."
1,The Da Vinci Code of the non-fiction world,"If you have any semblance of a brain, do not read this book (actually, you won't manage to get through it, in all likelihood), and certainly do not purchase it. It is an insult to anyone's intelligent, the non-fiction world's equivalent of that other vacuous nightmare, the Da Vinci Code. The chapters deliver no food for thought, and the little vignettes between the chapters reminding us how how much we are to appreciate the Emperor's New Clothes generates nauseau."
5,A Straight Dose of Truth,"In the past decade we've had several books explaining why societies are succeeding or failing. We've had FREAKONIMICS, THE WORLD IS FLAT, AND GUNS GERMS & STEEL. They all have some common themes in mind; over-use of resources, liberation of people through education, and in this case birth control.Birth control is one of the touchiest and most loaded topics in the media. At a community meeting I brought up the suggestion of free universal birth control and they cut the meeting short. Over population leads to increased competition for food/energy, and consequently leads to war."
1,Meaningless!,"This book is chalk full of meaningless information. Let me get this straight, the author actually believes people will deceive you at sometime in your life. WOW! What a revelation. I cannot see how this information is new to anybody. Sure they had a FEW things outside of the normal thought pattern. Yet this book was more on ""Hey look at how smart I AM and how DUMB everybody else is"". Not even worth it if somebody gave you the book to read and you had nothing better to do!DUMBEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!"
5,Good conversation piece,"While I don't thik Levitt goes far enough to back up his ideas, it is a great read and i'd reccomend. The chapter on abortion and crime has prompted many good pub conversations/arguments. Levitt's material is fresh and provides good fodder."
4,"Not dry or dull, it was a very interesting book!!","I thought this book might read like a textbook, with tables and dry statistics, but instead it held my attention and interest. I think it was due to the unusual correlations that the author was making (what teachers have in common with sumo wrestlers for instance), combined with the stories sprinkled through the book to make certain points. This is well worth the time to pick it up for a read."
4,Provocative. Well worth reading.,"There's actually nothing ""rogue"" about it: this is the stuff economists report on. Risks of everyday life are examined, commonly presumed ""conventional wisdom"" is refuted, plausible interpretations of statistical data are discussed, and it's interesting. (Levitt also proves that he is as human as other scientists with his terse caviling of John Lott and his work, casting aspersions with the word ""seems"" rather than providing support while omitting the most important and salient points of Lott's thesis.) What I find most fascinating are the correlations in the ECLS data pertaining to parenting. Provocative stuff!This is a pretty quick read, but be forewarned: controversy is inevitable. I think people tend to believe what they want to believe, so many will take issue with something in here. And while lots of figures are cited, there is not a single mathematical formula. Come on in. :-)"
3,Number game,"Interestingly, the book starts off very nicely with catchy questions and a unique perspective in answering them. However, you quickly realize that the author is beating around the bush and comes back to the same question and answers. The authors are prejudiced to begin with and therefore play with numbers and carefully framed sentences to win the reader's vote. In addition, the authors dismiss other works as providing 'little evidence' while providing little/no evidence to their own work.In short, the book is interesting and insightful but don't take it seriously."
4,Let the Data Speak,"A very interesting collection of microeconomic studies, covering topics as diverse as the impact of abortion on crime, the lack of ethics in Sumo wrestling, and the economics of being a drug dealer. I commend the primary author, Steven Levitt, for his courage in publishing the conclusions without adding a sugar coating of political correctness. Very refreshing. Apart from being a collection of intriguing stories, the authors teach the value of logical analysis, and the dangers of relying on superficial conclusions drawn by the media and foisted on an unsuspecting public. Is this a history changing book written by a modern day economic genius? No, but it is a worthwhile and fascinating read."
2,Hopefully it makes one think...,"...because if you take the statements in this book as truth you will be a victim of liberal bias. This book is a reporter's and professor's way of making a buck, and it should be read with a healthy level of sarcasm.While some of the correlations noted are interesting, there is no mention of the statistical predictive power of the variables being discussed, or of variables that were tossed out because they did not influence the result: was it the legalization of abortion that resulted in a decline in violent crime, as the authors assert, or was it the widespread availability of The Pill and prophylactic contraceptives?It's an interesting book, with many cocktail party tidbits, but the ""answers"" are merely uncorroborated correlations."
4,Very Interesting,"One note that a potential reader should understand is that you must delve into this book with an open mind. The author meticulously dissects normal mundane subjects in order to display the inner workings of economics. It was hard to become interested at first, but in the end it was well worth it."
4,Good read,"I enjoyed learning how an economist analyzes large amounts of data to draw meaningful conclusions where others can fail. The authors' subject matter is interesting. The book is well written in layman's language. They have touched socially sensitive issues with solid, well thought out, logical conclusions. The last section could've been shorter."
1,"Freakonomics - great title, lousy book",This book is poorly written and presents no new or interesting observations.
3,A little tedious,"Book was interesting but not as entertaining after the first coupla chapters, really plays on the abortion/crime relationship which I believe but can we move on..."
2,"Decent book, Nothing Special","This book was mediocre at best. It provided some interesting insights on a couple of things, but overall was rather bland. I viewed reading this as more of a chore than a pleasure. I started the book, so I felt obligated to finish it."
2,Don't waste your money on this!,"Abortion is largely responsible for the drop in the crime rate!Real estate agents will sell your house for less than his/her own.There it is, the only shreds of value in the entire book!This book is mostly an exercise in patience, with admittedly no central theme. This turns out being just a series of data, with little or no useful information for the layman.Listening to the the data was painfully like reading a spreadsheet aloud.The World is Flat cost far less and although I already read it, was far more interesting and revealing than this.I applaud people who keep track of miscellaneous information hoping it will amount to something someday, but this book does not.My purchase motivation was to peer into the criminal mind, but I ended up cursing at the cd player when the long list of baby names kept going on and on.Buying this was a very poor choice, I hope you don't have to experience it.Regards,Mike"
4,Mongolian cowboys on speed,"The Good, the Bad, the Weird is action packed and full of 'AH HA' moments as it takes the American Western and transplants it into Central Asia. Although the movie lifts a lot from its namesake the Good/Bad/Ugly, i.e, the three main characters mimic their counterparts Eli Wallach, Clint Eastwood, and Lee Van Cleef, the plot has enough unique twists and turns and incredible action and stunt work to make this movie stand out on its own. Any movie which has a battle including the Japanese army, Manchurian bandits, a bounty hunter, and a hitman and his gang all chasing the same thief is worth checking out! If you want to spend two hours jumping from one action/fight scene to another, GBW will hit the spot."
4,entertaining,An exciting movie and a lot of action scenes. I liked the humor that kept going through out the film. The scenery was great and the time period worked well for the picture. I enjoyed Kim's other films and this joins the unique set I own.
2,very good book. title a bit off,"This is a really good buy and I would still buy it. So why give it two stars. Because I am anal. I really like to do stuff ""in action"" and this book doesn't provide source code that you can just go and execute. They refer you to the caveatemptor application on the web which doesn't have any of the examples that demonstrate bad practices. I pretty much had to do a lot of trial and error setting up my database and then writing the app(that demonstrated a bad practice) from the text in the book to really gain that understanding of the bad practices.This book is great for people who already understand hibernate and probably don't need to try those examples, but this was my first time using any ORM. I would kill for the source code demonstrating every example in this book.Keep in mind I still got alot out of this book. Just required more effort on my part then alot of books that come with source code."
2,"Huge Disappointment, they all cheat readers","After having spent on useless Professional Hibernate, I bought this book in greater anticipation, atleast to get clear understanding on Associations, which always have been a big headache in Hibernate.I wonder what these Authors think about readers who look for books that could help them to learn new technologies. Instead of merely coping what is available in hibernate.org, (of course they did change object/class names wonderfully), they should give us WORKING examples.One has to scratch his head just to get things work.Honestly, this book discusses some of best strategies one has to follow while persisting important data. But main topic has been explained in IDIOTIC manner."
4,Very Pretty Ring.....however,"I bought this ring for myself and it is even more pretty in person then shown!However, upon closer inspection there is what looks a piece of the stone is chipped off, so sadly I had to return this item. But I'm sure that it was just a fluke, and I will try to get another one as overall I really like the ring."
5,Good book to begin.,First grade child loved this book. It is a good book to start with for practicing analogies. I would like to have another book in the next level but I could not find it
2,"Too many cities, too little information...","The descriptions of the ports were extremely limited due to the number of ports covered in this book. Since most people who cruise Europe tend to cruise one region, it would make more sense to have more detailed books devoted to specific regions. I bought this same type of book for an Alaskan cruise last year, and it was great, but there are fewer ports in Alaska. It does have some good information, but overall, I was disappointed."
3,Oh man...,"I personally loved the entire Excel Saga series. Some episodes were better than others on this DVD, but Ep 24 & 25 really stood out on this disc. Great and funny stuff, fantastic spoofs on some of the more popular anime.HOWEVER!There are times in some anime series where I wish an edited version existed. The last episode of Excel Saga is definetely one of these. NOT FOR KIDS SHOULD PROBABLY READ NOT FOR ANYBODY. I will not buy this DVD unless I can get it without Episode 26. It really threw this over all great series into the mud."
5,classic,one of the best albums i bought all year.. had trouble finding it for awhile.. all i knew were some song lyrics.. everyone should own this one
3,"A decent read, but too ""set in stone"".","I originally purchased this book to be way to help people who came to me looking for a way to learn the basics without getting drowned in too much in uncertainties or one persons personal views without room for other ideas. Honestly, I can say I am guilty of not researching out this book before clicking the order button.After finally having the time to sit down and read Basic Magick, I can say that I'm very hesitant about allowing anyone without previous experience dive head first into it. This is not due to the exercises being too difficult, but completely due to the feeling that the author believes completely that his way is the only way, and that there is no room for other ideas, which is completely unreasonable to me because magick has always been flexible to multiple methods for the same results."
2,It must be great to know it all,"Frankly I am surprised by the number of people who like this book. While the magikal techniques are certainly tried and true and the importance of positive mind sets, I was really turned off by his dogmatic and pompous statements. For example he ""Categorically states"" (his words) that 'astral' entities outside our own creation do not exist. That would include Angels, Devas, Nature spirits, what have you, along with demons and devils. While I would agree that we do indeed, for the most part create our own demons, metaphorically speaking anyway, it is arrogant to essentially say we (that of the physical world) are the only entities in existance, and that there are no other intelligences outside our dense vibration. Also, as one other noted, his dismissal of reincarnation and karma as being ""silly dogmas"" Well, they aren't even dogmas. But I guess if you treat magik as a science, you best alleviate the metaphysical, which somehow seems a contradiction, to me."
4,"19"" Carry On",I use this size of luggage for short business trips as my carry on. It will fit in all overhead compartment storage areas on any plane. It is very light and durable. I love the side and top handle options incase I want to carry it. Plus the wheels if I want to roll. This my second purchase of this size luggae from Atlantic.
5,Things have not changed in all these years,I read the book Still Unequal years ago. In fact I went to a book signing in Hillsborough NC and met the author. A local female attorney told me some members of the Orange Co. Bar advised her not to go and of course she didn't- just had me purchase a copy of Still Unequl for her. This book is just as accurate today as it was when it was first published. In all these years nothing seems to have changed. Every woman should read this book.
1,Swigline Electric Stapler,"This stapler was purchased for a busy retail store to staple receipts to order forms. It is used approximately 100 times a day. Unfortunately, it does not work half the time. Sometimes it will staple and sometimes we have to put it in 3-5 times for it to work. Sometimes it never works. It does not jam, it just won't staple. I would not recommend this stapler at all. What a waste of $140."
1,Not Recommended,"Amazon.com service was excellent, but the Swingline 69001 I received was a piece of junk, so I had to return it; one might think that such was an an anomaly, but I had ordered and received the same Swingline from another company (ordering via Amazon.com) the month before and that, too, was junk, so had returned to the seller. Swingline has had a good reputation and I've been pleased in the past - what's happening? It's very discouraging."
5,Learning is fun!,My 10 year old daughter loves this! She reads the book and puts the circuits together and has a blast playing with it while she is learning what she is building.
2,Waaay too sweet..,"IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Blackberry, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)Nice flavor but I found it so sweet it's undrinkable. I have been drinking Izzy carbonated juice drinks and find that level of sweetness just about right. Each of the tiny cans of Essn Meyer Lemon juice has the equivalent of about 11 teaspoons of sugar in it and about 170 calories. Being that the cans are only 8.4 ounces that's quite a lot. If you want something refreshing, avoid this. But if you like syrupy sweet drinks you'll like this. The lemon flavor is nice but they should cut the sugar in half if not by 2/3."
4,Makes a great lemon drop,Nice clean Meyer lemon flavor. These lemons are just a tad bitter and have more sweetness than any other lemon. Chefs LOVE using these lemons in recipes. This flavor also makes a great lemon drop!
3,3D? Not!,"The colorization is well done, but this is certainly not in 3D. Very dissapointed in that but it is classic Three Stooges. Once I took the glasses off it looked pretty good."
3,collectors beware,"I just want to give a bit of information to anyone thinking of buying this because the official product description is a bit vague.While the 3 Stooges did make a few films in 3D in the late '40s, none of them are included here. Instead, it has 4 shorts (Disorder In the Court, Brideless Groom,Sing a Song of Six Pants, Malice In the Palace) that have all been colorized and converted to 3D. The colorization is ok, but I would say that the 3D is actually very good.If you're looking to expand your 3D library and just want a fun disc for a cheap price, then I would definitely recommend this. If you're a collector hoping to get the Stooges original 3D shorts in HD, then you'll have to keep waiting."
2,"Roy Rogers - King of the cowboys boxed set, embossed tin","The best thing that can be said about this set is the colorful, fancy tin, storage case that it comes in. The quality of the movie entries is very poor, it appears they projected it on a white sheet, and then filmed it with a video camera. The television episodes, while still leaving a lot to be desired, are much better, acceptable you might say, but, as the old saying goes, You get what you pay for."
3,meh,"I wanted to be excited about this but its just not that great its got next to nothing for a finish and its so angled it was almost spoon like, I just don't like it but thats just my opinion. I am going to go with a stainless turner from an import store."
1,Waste of Money!,I put the battery in and the clock worked for a little while and then stopped. I changed the battery 2 or 3 times and it still did not work. I had to throw it in the trashcan. What a waste of money!
4,Entertaining for children and manchildren alike,"If my kid's going to watch something on the TV, I prefer to watch it with him (rather than use the TV as a surrogate parent). It's nice to find content that can entertain us both."
5,Season 1,"First off im grading this on the season not the DVD and its features. This has got to be the best spiderman cartoon to date, the episodes have great pacing and the spider-man scenes have a lot of action. Even the Peter Parker parts of the episodes are interesting to view. If they don't continue this series it would be a great loss for marvel and the fans."
3,lot of Vitamin E!,"My vet recommended 8,000 units per day! Yikes! That's a lot of Vitamin E! But, this product was available at a great price and easy to drain the gel cap to give the liquid to my mare every day. Thanks so much! She's better!"
1,Synthetic Vitamin E,This is the type of Vitamin E to stay away from and avoid. These are synthetic. DL-Alpha means synthetic. D-Alpha are Natural. And yes the human body knows the difference between synthetic and natural. There really is no nutritional value to synthetic Vitamin E. You're throwing your money away buying the synthetic formula.
4,An entertaining read,"I'm going to be honest with you. This is not as funny as either of Tim Allen's books, but it is an enjoyable read. After wondering whether or not to buy it for a good while, I finally bit the bullet and bought it. I'm glad I did, as I really enjoyed it, and you will too, especially if you like Richard Karn or his character on Home Improvement, Al Borland."
