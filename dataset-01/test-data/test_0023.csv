1,"Good materials, bad construction","I had this scoop, too, for all of a week. The handle snapped in mid-scoop at the point where the metal reinforcement ends. (The screen with two sizes was great.) Later found a scoop of all stainless construction that will outlast the cats, I'm sure."
3,Very good for removing waste in litter but should be made of Stainless Steel,"I agree with one of your readers. I have 8 Cats and i had purchased 2 of them a couple of months ago, But both of the two i had purchased Snapped, or broken in half. Should be made of Stainless Steel instead of plastic to add more strength."
4,Nice read,"Ever Since Darwin is a good book for those who already have a substantial knowledge regarding evolutionary theory. Gould does not offer any detailed explanations on the mechanisms of evolution. However, if you like to learn about the author's perspective on science and sociobiology in general, then this book is for you. He mostly discusses the history behind the theory and adds in how scientists, mostly in the past, were influenced by the society in which they lived in. Overall it is a well-written book with humour and witt."
3,Not chill bump material,"Most of the stuff I have heard Imogen do, I have wanted to hear all my life. This was not as good as I had hoped. She is so good live, and I love the ""speak for yourself"" album alot! I would just say she was playing around for the future here. And she did it.hats off to her for the success she has now for the playing around she did before!"
2,"Lots of music, little yoga","I was pretty disappointed with this video, but my daughter (age 2) seemed to like it. There is a lot of singing and a long intro, but little substance. There is little yoga, so there isn't much for kids to follow along with. As other reviews mentioned, it has a short running time."
3,Comfortable but not fashionable,"I just bought the black ones. They are very comfortable, but don't look fashionable at all. I wouldn't buy them if I see them in a store even with the same price, and I won't recommend friends to buy them. But I'm not returning them. I really need walking boots in winter. And the materials are good."
3,Beginner's Introductory Book,"I am tired of all the books that have the audacity label themselves as ""complete reference"". I have used linux for several years and this book is very much lacking in details. Security is coverly too lightly. The author focuses on the gui front ends for system administration, which may be fine for a home user toying around for the first time, but a serious administrator needs more information about what goes on behind the scenes. As a previous reviewer stated, this book covers a lot but doesn't cover anything in depth.This book is a good introduction to someone who know little about linux but I would not recommend it to anyone who plans to use a linux machine as a serious production server."
5,A Great Source,"I have purchased items from several of the stores reviewed in this book and have visited a number of them. My experience has been consistent with the author's comments. While I have owned several guides on NC furniture, this is the best that I have seen. I wouldn't shop without it. It will pay for itself many, many times over."
5,Tracks for the 1980 Sony Japanese Edition CD!,"1.The Crawl2.Sitting In The Jail House3.Like A Rolling Stone4.New York, New York5.Bon Ton Roulet6.Rollin' And Tumblin'7.Talk Is Cheap8.Wolf In Sheep's Clothing9.Don't Hide Your Love10.Mother-In-Law Blues11.Walkin' Slowly"
4,Very practical and biblical book.,"This book is very concise and offers to-the-point reasons for why a believer should avoid sin, and then gives tangible examples of how that is to be done, according to the Bible. If you love the depth of insight that the Puritans had into the Bible, then you will love this book. Written in 16th Century language, like the King James Bible. Very encouraging!"
2,once upon a texas train,"good to see all those old time cowboys in this movie, takes me back, to bad age takes thier action and advanture out of them"
5,Remember when?,"We enjoyed seeing actors from serious westerns decades ago now reuniting in all their wilted glory to show a group of smart-aleck kids what REAL men can do. Of course, these aging Texas Rangers and their arch-enemy desperado gang have a few challenges to overcome... nothing works quite so well as it did when they were younger. Perhaps we won't find it so funny once we get to that age??? It's hard to keep track of our first copy as it moves around the house, so we decided to buy a second!"
4,Red Velvet - Worth the wait,I had been waiting for this movie to come out since I met a couple of the actors at WonderCom in 2008. I had almost forgotten about it when I received an email telling me that it was out. The movie definitely met my expectations and then some. Henry Thomas is briliant in his role as the lead and has a great chemistry with the Kelli Garner who is totally hot. The plot moved around nicely and I was glued to the TV to see how it would play out. The movie is not too short and not too long and has the right amount of gore. The dialog and character development is what really makes the movie. I definitly recommend the movi!
2,Mindless fun...,"Although the sequel looks a bit better than ""A Fistful of Boomstick"" it is not as much fun to play. Spell casting is gone as are the ability to interact with the enemies etc while using Ash's trademark lines. If you like the movies it is worth a look as long as you aren't expecting Gears of War you will be fine."
1,Two bottles...two broken caps,"The caps for these fuel bottles are the worst caps I have ever seen. After 2 fills, the threads from both caps were almost completely stripped. Both of the bottles I received came with the child-proof caps that are very, very flimsy. One of the caps had the child-proof portion completely break off, rendering the stripped cap doubly useless. Now I have two bottles that cannot be used at all. MSR caps will not fit apparently. Customer service is non-existent. I tried to contact Brunton by phone and email with no success. There is no place to buy replacement caps. It is cheaper to just buy MSR bottles and extra caps than to have completely useless fuel bottles after minimal use. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!"
1,Cause hang on G4 Mac,Installed this card on my G4 with 10.2.6. It works straight away without installing any driver for USB 1.1 devices. Then I installed the latest driver downloaded from IOGear web site and restarted my system. My system hang when I connected a USB 2.0 card reader to it. It consistently hang my system and I had to restart every time the system hang. I returned the card yesterday.
1,So much potential........,"I bought this book because of the title; it sounded extremely interesting. Unfortuately though, the author doesn't seem to have an expertise on the subject he chose to write a book about. After having read about half of it, I'd realized I'd been ripped off. I could have written this book! Most of it is filler, and it feels like a grade 10 highschool students' essay that required a high word count. I will be extremely cautious next time I decide to purchase a computer book, I didn't realize non-experts were allowed to write computer books...."
1,Don't Waste Your Hard Earned Money,"Worst book I've ever paid for. If I could have rated this book zero stars I would have. I'll never pick up another book by this author ever again, let alone buy one."
1,Did not work; no support,Installed the product according to the directions on my Dell Inspiron 5100 running XP Pro. It never recognized the HP OfficeJet Printer. Uninstalled; reinstalled - no luck. Contacted customer support twice. No response.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!,"Do not waste your money on this. It's very poorly made, imported from China and gives off a strong toxic chemical smell that will give you an instant headache. I wouldn't recommend this at ALL for children, despite what the product information says. Give this one a fast pass."
1,Trash,"This is no talent chick rock at it's best. Anyone who loves the likes of Zeppelin wont subject themselves to this tripe. If you own this album you own every nicklecrap album, nuff said."
1,This is almost as bad as the Clone Temple Pilots,"Oh, boy. Look out, this record is almost as poor-sounding as the Clone Temple Pilots -- only difference is, this guy has a beard. Or a goatee. Whatever you youngsters call 'em in 2011.Chad Kroeger is an oaf beyond belief, whereas the dude from Creed actually possessed some pretty solid reps. Give him credit ... cuz it's due.The guy from the Pilots is just a waste. Anyone heard what's going on in the Halen camp?????I'll check ya later, peeps ..."
3,It's ok...,"I'm a long time fan of NB and find this album and State/Curb to be both pretty good. IMO not as great as their later albums, but still worth it for fans."
2,constipated much?,"My coworker accidentally bought this CD thinking it was new material. While not horrible enough for me to insist she not play it, it is extremely repetitive and dull. The vocals sound sluggish and overwhelmed by too much guitar. Let's just say that I dislike this CD enough to visit amazon.com especially to write this negative review."
1,QUACK,"Gould is a reactionary, who is simply trying to salvage a washed up, out-of-date, theory. His efforts are weak and unconvincing. For a better resource, try Phillip Johnson's ""Of Pandas and People"", which is well written and convincing."
4,this book was an enchanting fable...,"the story sets a scene of serenity, but later the plot thickens and complications trouble androcles and his lion friend, but old friends remain friends, and it is their friendship that saves them in the end."
1,couldn't finish the book,I don't remember hearing this version when I was growing up. Boiling a little boy and a few other graphic wording made me shut the book before finishing. Not the visions I want to put in my little girls mind. There is enough on tv for that. I will find another Hansel and Gretel book.
5,Love it!,"My granddaughters just loved this story and this particular book, with it's set of drawings. It is part of my effort to see fi my granddaughters would react positively to the old fairy tales and the answer is a resounding yes!"
1,The Long Ride Home,"As a western buff i almost bought this movie before i saw it, glad i didn't. This is a soap opera western. Eric Roberts i can't believe you said all those mushy lines with a straight face, i hope the pay was good! There are plenty of great westerns at Amazon, just don't bother with this one."
2,Superficial,"Tom Brokaw may have always been a chatterbox, too bad he didn't have much to say. This book basically skims the surface of a child of the fifties. There are not many amusing anecdotes, not much detail, and no depth of feeling, and as a result not much to relate to. A disappointment because it could have been so much better, if the author would have dug a little deeper."
2,Allison 65-0346BLK Black Hawaiian print bucket seat cover,"The seat was black and white print on a blue background, why call BLACK? Even if the back of the seat and the lower part that goes around the seat is black, the background is NOT grey as shown on the picture. At first I though I was sent a wrong seat but the label on the packaging confirmed it was the right item.I probably should've sent the whole thing back as it really does not match my black and white Jeep."
2,NOT BLACK AS INDICATED!,"The covers themselves are fine, a little thin but they will do. The COLOR is NOT black. They are BLUE !!Very disappointed."
2,Pay a little more somewhere else.,"I have purchased the same Hawaiian (from Hawaii) seat covers every summer for the last 8 years. They are for my jeep wrangler,the custom fit neoprene covers get too hot in top-down weather. The summer covers get abused so I only expect them to last the season. My usual covers were back ordered this year so I bought these. Mistake, these are really cheap and won't last more than a couple of weeks. They are short on fabric (don't fully cover the seat back) and the way they are attached is over engineered while using poor components. Pay a little more for the real deal because you are wasting your money on these."
1,"This item is great, but they sell USED item. The box is totally mess up, The package has been opened, Items inside was used.","This item is great, but they sell USED item. The box is totally mess up, The package has been opened, Items inside was unpack. A part was missing. This suppose to be a Christmas gift and now I cannot give this away I've been wait for 2 week to get it arrive. What take it so long??? by boat?"
5,Good movie - not a great movie - but a good movie,"The writing: uninspired. The acting: uneven (the main character fairly awesome, the rest so-so). The story - so interesting, it makes up for any shortcomings elsewhere."
2,Not a good script,"The script was immature - there was no wisdom in it. Some of the characters (his parents) were caricatures, and not funny. We fast forwarded through some of the movie because it was so worthless, until they got to India, where the palace and beach scenes were colorful and beautiful - but the story was stupid. I absolutely hate in movies where a character grabs a microphone and announces to the crowd how he feels - that's in here. Also I felt the acting of the American girl Theresa was not good, while the acting of the Indian fiancée was very good. Overall the Indian scenery was nice, but the story was not worth sitting through the whole movie."
4,Promises of Beautiful Things to Come,"""Milk and Honey,"" Jerry Herman's first Broadway musical shows the promise of the wealth of hummable, memorable scores he would compose, with ""Hello, Dolly!"", ""Mame,"" ""LaCage Aux Folles,"" ""Mack and Mabel,"" etc. in the future. Like all of Mr. Herman's scores, the songs remain in your head long after you have put the CD back in its jewel case. This is a mature score, always a deeply melodic score, sometimes deeply emotional, other times, wonderfully funny, but always touching.I loved the score the first time I heard it, and still love it today."
1,Almost fell asleep from this book!,"I have no idea what the author was trying to say. I spend 90 minutes reading it and I pray I havent lost more than 2 or 3 million brain cells trying to digest it. If you have insomnia, try reading this book before you go to sleep."
1,Stay Away,"This book is just terrible. No examples, unrelated problems, and poorly written text is all you will find.Example: One question asks you to refer to you 'basic vibration textbook' to find out how to do the problem (as they do not explain in the book). What is the point of questions like this?Also many times you will find yourself staring in awe at the wording in this book. There are many sentences written so poorly that they simply have no meaning."
2,this is not a good text.,"i have to say that this book is very up and down. some parts and explained really well, some not so much. the one's that aren't explained well are full of typo errors, and it just gets annoying. i do not recommend this book."
4,Box on Box,First I bought the model one radio and then I bought the cd player. Good stuff however I don't like the multiple box concept. For the same money I could have bought a Bose Wave.
5,"Fun, fun, fun...","Length:: 0:40 MinsThe Jolly Jumper is my--and my son's--favorite toy. We live in a house that would not allow for the traditional doorway jumpers, and I was not a fan of the Jumperoos (there was just too much distraction on those items). I was looking for a toy that would provide safe entertainment, and expend some energy that tummy-time just wasn't able to accomplish. The Jolly jumper has done just that. The seat takes a little practice snapping baby into, but after a few times it can be done quickly. Additionally, it does take floor space, but can be folded away quickly behind a door or into a closet.Really what it comes down to is that my son lights up when he sees this toy.**As a tip for parents and caregivers--this provides lots of jumping so put baby on some kind of mat or floor that is easily cleaned as there are often drool ""pools"" (or spit-up) when baby is done playing :)"
3,A little disappointed in change,Really like this product just disappointed. They used to send samples of their other products when you made a purchase. So I'm a little disappointed. It was greatly appreciated.
4,"Fairly interesting, and you don't need to read it all to get a good takeaway","I enjoyed this book, or what part of it I read, anyway. It is the rather un-nuanced account of the adventures had by a group of knights (of the Round Table, of course). There is no character development and very little overarching plot to tie the stories together, but there is something oddly compelling about it. There is a great deal of smiting, and rending helms asunder, and rescuing fair maidens in distress (can you imagine???? The evil giant makes ladies actually do manual labor, though they be of high birth!).You get the general idea pretty quickly, I've read half and feel like I've gotten all I will get out of this book. It's free though, so I am glad I checked it out."
3,Old Book,Its a fine story....but since I downloaded it for free I cant really complain about anything regarding this story here
4,Worthy Follow Up To Knee Deep in the Hoopla,"As far as musical integrity and importance..STARSHIP doesnt come to mind. As far as light airy 80's rock songs, STARSHIP comes in for a dead center landing right into my brain. Knee Deep In The Hoopla( 1985) had 3-4 catchy songs and so does ""No Protection"" (1987). I liked the opening track ""The Beat Patrol"". Then there's the song from Mannequin ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now."" That song could have been marketed as part of a ""BAND-AID"" project for stopping world hunger at the time.""Set the Night To Music"" is Spot-on for another solid hit. ""Let the Children Follow"" is catchy. In a nutshell, Starship followed suit from their previous album. Maybe it doesnt have quite the ultimate cheeziness of ""Sara"" and ""We Built This City"" but there's plenty of cheese whiz for you to enjoy. I know I do."
2,Average,"I liked the rollicking It's Not Over (Til It's Over), though it's surprising that it was a hit in 1987. If it was performed today, it'd be perfect background music on Dr. Phil's talk show or Anthony Robbins' motivational tapes and DVDs. It has a strong message to it about standing up for yourself. The rest of the album fails to match up to this song. It's mostly paint-by-numbers corporate '80s rock that would have sounded better on Journey's albums. The bombastic guitars, the over-the-top sounds and the unimaginative songwriting are mediocre at best. Think of this, drive while listening to this CD during 112 miles I-95 in Georgia south of Savannah, and you'd forget about most of it one hour later! That's just how average and flat it is. No matter how many jokes people make about the 80s, the clothes, the big, long hair the fashions, the neon lights, they can also comment on how lousy this Starship album sounded. It wasn't their best music either!"
3,"Stylish design, but poor quality.","I purchased the tan leather case a couple of months ago. It's a stylish looking case, but not worth the price. The color has faded and the cheap clip fell apart after a few months. I did receive a lot of compliments when i first purchased it, but it worthless once the cheap plastic clip breaks."
4,works fine but:,"I was unaware that a card was necessary for the usb 2, so therefor I wasted my money buy buying this usb2 buslink that runs only at the speed of usb1, and I had wanted to pass this from computer to computer, and I did not wish to take out my harddrive everytime I wanted to download large files rapidly"
3,Inspiring,"Not for the quick read, a detailed autobiography of this saint's journey from a life of sin to following God's plan."
4,Hard read,"I am glad I read this, have wanted to for years. I finished it, but what a hard book to read and remember."
2,Stricken with false arguments,"There are a ton of holes in this guys arguments. Pretty sad too because I agree with his stand point that no one should tell us what to or what not to eat. It's our decision and survival of the fittest. However, his arguments were terrible and obviously so. I especially love the part on Lawyer Logic.He so comfortably calls the ""lawyers"" idiots for talking about restaurants being around for hundreds of years and then injects his own...more like thousands of years idiots. He should have done his research because restaurants have been around for hundreds of years. It's a very new concept in the scheme of things. Only goes to show how little he did his research."
1,Yet another bitter far-flung right-winger,"This conservative Libertarian was us to believe it's the liberal media that's bad and the corporate capitalists burger-slingers are the poor, misunderstood victims. What a load of bunk. Guaranteed his next documentary is on the 'myth' of global warming."
2,"Lazy filming, editing and investigation make for a poor product.","This ""documentary"" tried hard to play for laughs but failed in so many ways. It was an entertaining watch for sure but the intellectual laziness of the Mr Naughton was offensive. Obviously fast food chains aren't going to ""force"" you to eat their food, no one has claimed (including Morgan Spurlock) that they do so to continue to try and play that angle on crappy SD (looked like it was shot on an old Canon Z series or something from 2003-4) with low budget, uncreative editing and a general lack of comprehension for the matter he is speaking against make this a poor watch."
1,WARNING this doc is horrible,Not sure how so many people are giving this a high rating. I suspect that someone is doing some guerrilla marketing using Amazon's review system. This movie is not scientific in ANY way. It has tried to align itself to the success of super size me much in the way that low budget shark movies popped up everywhere after Jaws.I studied Nutrition in college. FACT: fast food is NOT a good alternative to slow grown veggies out of a garden on the side of your house. PERIOD.
2,had to stop watching,"I admire tom naughton for making a movie to counterpoint supersize me, but he's not as charismatic as morgan spurlock and he comes off as an angry guy who is trolling."
2,False,Hog wash! All of the people are young so they don't have health conditions by JUNK food. Not one of the people were old.
1,Terrible,"Right from the beginning, terrible. Comic is not funny at all and the movie was poorly put together. In addition, it was a lame attempt to rip off Super Size Me."
5,Just too cool!,"I got this wireless card based on the recommendation of a friend after I lost my other card. I am VERY happy with it. The configuration is very easy and quick, and the client utility is very well laid out for finding new networks and setting up profiles to save the configuration settings. One word of advice... the version of the client utility that comes with the card is not the latest one. Go to their website and download the 2.4.2.14 version to get the very latest in software and driver. Highly recommened..."
4,Most hilarious 'Christmas Pageant Ever',"Very hilarious account of a routinized town Christmas pageant overrun by the Stedmans, a cigar-chomping, cursing group of kids who have the audacity to appear in the show and actually ask what it's all about. Their questions make the narrator, a local child, rethink the story of Jesus' birth and realize that it has significance for everyone on Earth, not just the well-to-do pageant producers. Nicely done on all counts."
4,Look out for the Herdmans!,I think the Herdmans are pretty funny.They have a cat that only has one eye.The Herdmans are the worst kids in the world.
5,Book review,"This has got to be one of the funniest books I have read in a long time. Since buying it, I have met several people who have rad it and agree."
4,A Christmas Pageant,They were having a Christmas Pageant.It takes place at the Church.The Heardmen's are in the Christmas Pageant.The Heardmens are mean people in the school.Everybody thought it was going to be the worst Christmas Pageant Ever.Well it was finally the day that they were going to have the Christmas Pageant.When it ended everybody thought it was great.They said there was soething special about it.
2,Terrible Illustrations,"My five year old was very put off by the illustrations, and so was I. At times they were so unclear that we couldn't tell what was supposed to be going on in the picture. It's a good story but needs better pictures."
4,The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,"Really Enjoyed, we are going to do this at our church this Christmas. We have sent off for the play."
2,Unless you have a very quiet place to talk...,"The problem with Bluetooth headsets in general is they are near your ear but 4-5 inches your mouth. Therefore the microphone is reaching a long way to pick up your voice and has little ability to screen your voice from everything else around you. Unless you are in a quiet room, forget the current offerings of Bluetooth headsets.This headset is no exception.On the other hand, it is comfortable and works well if you need it where it excels, a quiet room.However, I'll wait until an offering is available that works outside the quiet confines of the design lab."
1,"Static, Static, Static!","This headset has a major flaw - the connections between the headset and phone are full of static. The other parties don't hear it, but their voice is constantly zapped by the static, and I'm asking them to repeat themselves. I've compared it with a couple other headsets I've got, and they don't have this problem in the same locations. Actually, this headset has static problems ANYWHERE - office, car, out walking, you name it.Do yourself a favor and avoid this one."
2,4.5 Star rating,This headset is uncomfortable to wear but if you heat the earpiece and bend it outwards and back it will fit just fine. You can also go to an eyewear store and have them do it for you.As for the performance it is great. I drive truck and have a lot of background noise and windows are usually down partially and everyone has no problems hearing and understanding me and I can hear them just fine also. The volume is great and at times I have to turn it down in volume. Have tried the AnycomHS-890 and this outperforms it hands down. Have had it drop my phone on occasion but never during a call where the Anycom would at any time. I would definitely reccommend this headset to anyone in a noisy environment. Very satisified with the performance. Tried to change the rating and seems like can't do that once the review is written. Amazon needs to fix the edit system on this.
4,Windows 7 Alert,Kensington must think Windows 7 is a fad because they are not providing any software updates to make this trackball compatible.
1,poor upgrade,"i own the previous version of this trackball and have used and loved every day... Then, i bought another one for my second system, and it is awful... just absolutely awful.... the ball feels very GRAINY to roll.... it sticks... it has not broken-in in over two months of constant use...this new model is very stiff... the ""control ring"" around the ball is used as the wheel to move up/down the screen.... same issue... very GRAINY... stiff.. i can actually hear the parts rubbing against one another....i love my old kensington track ball... but this new one i bought from Amazon is a total piece of junk...."
3,Expected more,I tried an older model of one of these that my friend has and the ball and scroll ring are very smooth. The one that I purchased and received is not. The scroll ring is very rough the roller ball is smooth and comfortable. I was told the the scroll ring would break in but up until now it is not. I do like the extended wrist rest and use it. For the money I did expect the entire unit to work silky smooth.
2,Buyers beaware,"Any potential buyer should know that this product is not really worth the price from its quality.The hand rest gives a bad smell and the body of this device produced from low quality plastic.Overall the device is workable and working fluently on both my Mac and Windows machine. A really special feeling using this very big trackball.Note:1. This trackball is for someone with a big palm2. The quality is not as goog as expected a $80 product.3. If you never use a trackball before, it will take some time to get used to it.(I owned this product for three weeks now)"
5,Great,Works like a charm and have replaced all my other mice with Kensington products. Would recommend to anybody who wants an easier way to navigate on screen.
3,Disappointed,"Just a reminder of what has been said here before... This product does not fully support the iMacs with Intel chips. It cannot be programmed via the included software, so you're stuck with the capabilities of the pre-programmed keys."
1,No software for MAC 9.1,"Nothing on Amazon's site gave system requirements of MAC 10 or later. My older Kensington Expert Mouse Pro after many years of hard use gave up the ghost, so I got the new one, it moves the curser sluggishly but all four buttons do the same thing, the scroll ring doesn't do any thing. The ball is smaller than the older one, I can't use my ""8"" ball. I have used a Kensington Expert Mouse for almost 20 years and have never had a complaint till now. I can get use to the sluggish and smaller ball, but I wish the software were compatible."
3,Short of expectations,"As an old user of various track balls during the past 15 - 20 years I was anxious to have one to use with my I-Mac. Bought one at a great price, hooked it up, and downloaded the appropriate ( I think) software driver from Kensington. Still can't get it to work. Won't load and I can't set the functions as I would like. No response from Kensington on my query for help. Stuck with basic out-of-the-box functions. Very disappointed. Any suggestions?"
1,Don't bother,"The Wireless Turbo Mouse would seem to be a good bet, however it suffers from a very poor implementation of the scrolling ring when used on the web. The problem is it should advance the screen smoothly, but it's annoyingly jerky, and therefore continues to be annoying day after day, month after...ect. I called Kennsignton in an effort to tell them my thoughts, and was listened to patiently, but it was a waste of time. The point is, this company had a lot going for it years ago, but now seems to be coasting down hill. Also, the battery needs replacement about once a week, so if you buy this, plan on a recharger and extra set of C cells."
4,The Best (with one caveat),"This is really the best input device out there, for so many reasons. Believe the hype.There is one unavoidable flaw, however; the scroll wheel WILL stop working eventually. I've now had my third one fail in as many years. Fortunately, Kensington has replaced it each time. My fourth Expert Mouse is in the mail now. Kudos to Kensington for honoring their warranty so faithfully, but I have to wonder why they don't fix the underlying problem.Anyway, this is a great product which has taken me well off the path to carpal tunnel syndrome. I recommend switching hands regularly. I've written an AutoIt script (surprisingly easy to do) which quickly toggles the buttons between right and left handed configurations, and assigned the top two buttons (clicked together) to launch the script. This way, I can switch hands and have the buttons mirrored with a single click. Becoming ambidextrous with the Expert Mouse shouldn't take too long to master and is well worth the effort."
5,Kensington stands behind their products!,I've purchased 2 of these mice over the years and the second one always had problems (wouldn't always be recognized by the system and would lock up computers). Because they are at the upper end price wise on mice I decided to get the second one replaced. I explained the issues to Kensington support and they replaced the mouse in its final year of warranty support (5 years). I know a lot of people don't really consider a warranty on something like a mouse but this saved me $70+. Way to go Kensington.Now about the mouse. This is a nice large mouse great for use left handed by right handed people. I am a programmer and mousing on all day has left me with some RSI in my right hand. So now at work and home I only use this mouse left handed and over the years I've become sufficiently dexterous with my left hand as to not slow down my work at all. I only use a regular laser mouse with my right hand for gaming. Good company and good product.
5,Awesome product,"This Kensington Expert Mouse Optical USB Trackball is awesome. I have used trackballs for many years and this one is exceptional because it feels as though it glides under your hand. Kensington has done a great job with this new mouse. I find it much more comfortable to use than a standard mouse because of the minimal movement of the wrist. The one thing you have to be mindful of is keeping your hands free of oils, lotions, etc. so that it doesn't gum up the trackball and affect the inner workings of the mechanism."
2,Quality control is suffering; scroll ring sticks,"I had one of these two years ago that worked great and is still working. My most recent purchase is okay, except that the scroll ring mechanism is sticky and gets stuck when you try to smoothly scroll. It is annoying. I will be sending it back for repair soon."
5,The ultimate combination of great support and product,"The Kensington Expert Optical Trackball has virtually become the standard by which others are measured by. Because of the price, most users hope that less expensive trackballs will suffice, but quality comes at a price. Fortunately Kengsington has hit the mark with excellent design and functionality. My experience with Kensington was a total pleasure. The unit is exceptional, but I accidently broke the wrist rest and wrote to Kensington for a price on a replacement part. I received a very prompt and thorough response and they sent an entirely new trackball with wrist rest free of charge. That's called perfect product service, and I just wanted to share this side of product satisfaction with everyone."
3,"Great design, ball works smooth, needs easier to press buttons","Great design, ball works great, needs easier to press buttons. They often stick and at times have to press a button 4 times to get the operation to work."
3,"Great mouse, mostly","This is a great mouse, until one of the ball bearings the big ball rests on, gets lost or damaged and then it is junk. Kensington offers no support when this happens."
1,Dropped the ball.,"I had an issue with a chipped control ball, which renders the trackball useless. It took some correspondence, but eventually they decided to send me a replacement, free of charge. It has been 6 weeks and the control ball has not arrived. I think I was lied to again.I have used one of these for years, and was very satisfied with the performance. However, with no support, and their decision to weasel out of the warranty, I would not recommend any Kensington products to anyone."
1,No drivers for Windows 7 or Vista,"My mistake in assuming they would be up to date with their drivers.From their own website:Is Kensington planning to release Mouseworks software compatible with Microsoft Vista or Windows 7?AnswerThere are no plans to do so at this time. It is important to know that you should not install Mouseworks on any PC running Microsoft Windows Vista or Windows 7. Mouseworks was exclusively developed to run under Windows XP and earlier versions of Windows. The Control Panel for Vista and Windows 7 does incorporate some options for input device configuration such as pointer speed adjustment, scrolling speed, and left/right button switch, however Mouseworks functionality such as button programming, fine tuning of acceleration et cetera are not supported."
3,Lid Comes Off Too Easily,"As I think some of the other reviews have said, the lid comes off of this very easily, so my son simply takes the lid off to put the shapes inside. He likes to chew on the shapes and he like putting things in the box, but he is not getting the educational benefit of the shape sorter."
1,I've wasted 10 bucks.,I love the idea of this toy BUT how is my kid supposed to benefit from sorting if the lid comes off extremely easily?! I'm seriously considering getting my money back.
2,Strange Design or Ours Came Broken,"We received this for my son's first birthday from someone who bought it from Amazon. The lid comes off - it does not attach on, and sits very loosely on top of the pail. My son is playing with the lid seperately from the rest of the toy. I think it defeats the purpose - I'm not sure if we received a defective toy, or it was designed this way."
3,Good toy,I definitely recommend this toy. Is was just the rift gift for the holidays. The kids loved it and it really keeps them busy all te time . It was a good choice for us.
4,Great product,My family really enjoyed this toy - I'm sure yours will too - Great value for money!The plastic is strong and durable and the colours excite young children. Can't wait to buy more similar.
2,Hmmm,The lid does not stay on very well. I sit with my daughter to teach her to put the correct shape through the correct hole and she gets frustrated and takes the lid off (because she knows she can) and puts it in that way. I wish the lid would stay on better and it would be a much better toy.
1,did not receive the toy,"Amazon sent me an email saying they were refunding the money because it was not a deliverable address, which is funny because everything else I bought with it arrives without a problem. But maybe the problem was with the Post Office person that did not want to walk all the way to our door to deliver it. Anyway, my review is just to say i never got it."
5,one of our most played with!,"My daughter was given this for her first birthday. We had a few other shape sorters, so I had planned on returning it, but my husband took it out of the box and I sure am glad he did. My daughter LOVES this. We started by putting the top on the floor and doing it as a puzzel. That is still her favorite way to do it, but now she also drops the pieces in. Over Christmas my family was here and my sister thought the same thing as me, that she had other shape sorters and didn't need one like this, but after watching my daughter and her daughter she wanted one. This is a great toy to take places too because it can keep my daughter entertained for a while. One of our favorite toys!"
3,"Baby loves this toy, but not for the purpose intended!","As most reviewers have already stated, the lid on this bucket is useless. Not only does it not snap into place, it literally just rests on top of the bucket. So if my kid knocks over the bucket, the lid is gone. It just seems so useless in that respect.However, my daughter, for whatever reason, has loved this toy since I gave it to her at about 6 months. She loves throwing the blocks and putting them, along with other small toys, into the bucket. Using this toy properly is a work in progress since she just barely turned one. She's able to get some of the easier shapes in like the circle and square, but the star and cross shapes just frustrate her since those are a little more difficult.Overall, I'm still happy with the toy since it makes her happy and I do foresee her using it more properly in the future with more guidance from us (meaning having one of us adults holding the lid in place so she's forced to actually try using it properly)."
2,"Top doesn't stay on, useless as a sorter toy.","As a sorting toy, this isn't one to get. The top doesn't stay on, and my child always takes it off. She still plays with the pieces though, carrying them around, tossing them, and putting other items into the little basket. She seems to enjoy it otherwise, just wasn't made to be a good sorting toy."
3,Top comes right off,"We bought this toy for our toddler to learn to sort the blocks based on shapes cut into the top of the box. However, the top comes off too easily so all she does is take it off and dump the blocks in or out. I'm giving it three stars as she does get enjoyment out of this toy but it doesn't really work as a shape sorting toy."
4,Simple but smaller than expected,"I like the product due to it's simplicity but when I recieved it, it was a little smaller than I expected. Nothing wrong overall with the toy though."
3,Fun but not so educational,"My daughter is 9 months old, and she really loves this toy, but I have the same problems as the other reviewers. She pulls the lid right off and never bothers to actually sort the shapes."
4,Fun toy,"Honestly my son hasn't played with this in a while but when he did, he really liked it. He would get frustrated trying to fit the shapes in the holes, sohe'd remove the cover and jut throw them in! Overall, a nice toy!"
4,Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Baby's First Blocks,"This toy is educational so buy it and keep getting items so desire for my daughter. Only she is still very small and not meant for it. For now, pulls and bites."
4,Great :),Came in great condition and perfect packaging but havent used yet since its a Christmas present for my 1yr old son but I know hes gonna love it! Thank you!!!
1,Bad for baby's health!!!!!,"It's a decent toy which solves its purpose. My only complain is it's cheaply made so very light(Had this almost 10 yrs back in a round shape and was very sturdy) and also the top doesn't have any lock so my daughter continuously takes it out and tosses it. One more bad thing is there is a block of the shape '+' sign and '*', I am not sure what to tell my kid about the shape once she starts understanding. I recently discovered that this product contains 'Bromines' which can cause damage to organs such as liver, kidneys, lungs and milt and they can cause stomach and gastrointestinal malfunctioning, to read go to healthystuff.org. I am returning this stuff and I strongly think Amazon should stop selling this product.Giving it 1 star."
3,It's okay,This toy is okay. As others have said-the lid doesn't stay on. My 1 yr old just takes the lid off and dumps the blocks out. She enjoys playing with the blocks but has no interest in trying to sort them through the lid.
2,Would be great if the top was not so easy to remove,"My daughter likes playing with this toy, for a few minutes until she decides the easiest way to get the shapes into the box is to remove the top and place them in that way. I wish it was a little more difficult to remove, perhaps it could snap on and off so babies can't just lift it off and ""cheat""!"
2,Disappointing,"I bought this for my granddaughter to help teach her colors/shapes. The thing I hate about this product is the top will not stay on. There is no snap or anything to keep it on so when my granddaughter couldn't put a shape in she would just lift the top and toss it in. Also, when she toted it and it tipped over, all the pieces would fall out (because of the lousy top)."
5,My son loved it!,"My son loved playing with this toy. It is an educational toy, challenging for the younger ones but my grandson loved it and now we are passing it on to my next grandchild!"
4,FISHER PRICE FOR TODDLER,CHOOSE 4 AS A RATING FOR THIS TOY. LIKED THAT IT IS EASY TO MAINTAIN AND CLEAN. RECOMMEND AS A FIRST TOY.
5,Highly recommend,"It helps babies learn their shapes and colors. It also keeps the mess down. I also like that you can take it in to the tub. It can be given to a baby and they will still play with it as they get in to school. And when you are done with it, you can give it to someone else who has a baby."
5,"All-In-One Toy: Colors, Shapes, and Fine Motor Skills","My daughter loved this toy when she was young. It helped her learn five colors and shapes, and we also used it as a therapy toy when she was young (fine motor skills)."
2,Sorting box,I bought this for a 1 year old. The yellow lid does not stay on the box so it is difficult for the baby to experiment with putting the shapes in the different places.
3,Baby's 1st blocks,"This toy is very nice, however, my son who is 16mths walks around with the blocks and his mouth and the top of the bucket he bang on hard surface. I wish this had some form of music on it. I like it!!"
4,mother,I love the colors. My only complaint is the lid comes off super easy so there is no way to encourage the kids to use the top instead of just throwing them in the bucket.
3,ok,This toy is very well made. Durable and brightly colored. The lid does not stick on as well as would be expected. It is very loose and falls off if tipped over or baby bumps it.
2,The lid doesn't snap on,The purpose of this toy is defeated when our babies can easily remove the lid and put the shapes on the basket without the use of the lid. I would not recommended.
3,Good to learn,It is a good today. Will help the kids development on shapes. It is a toy a kid needs to have.
2,"Lid just sits on top, not for travel","We got this as a gift and I was not aware the lid is not attached- it just sits on top. I probably would not have asked for it if I would have realized. There have to be better shape sets out there!There is a website you can use to see how healthy toys are and the rating was low for toxins. I would feel better if these were BPA-free, Phthalate-free, and PVC-free and wish the larger toy companies would be concerned- but they sell- so they don't. It was not until my neice was diagnosed with cancer that I started thinking about all the things my kids put in their mouths."
3,A few thoughts...,"The Battle of Corrin is the final book in the prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert & Kevin Anderson. Overall, the book fits in well with the other books in the series. However, the book has a huge amount of ground to tie up all the plot lines introduced in the other two books. The conclusion to the various major plotlines are fairly predictable but written with sufficent detail and style to make it worth reading.The background material on folding space, Bene Gesserit (sp?) and hatred between the Atreides and the Harkonnens are interesting. I liked the way the Luddite religious extremists are done; a nice social commentary on blind faith combined with a lack of knowledge or thought. It has an interesting perspective when considered with the recent events in Iraq.The book is a fairly quick read and worth it if you enjoy the Dune Galaxy."
1,An unpleasant read,"This was a VERY difficult book for me to read. I tried many times to focus and get into the story, but the poor job of storytelling made this impossible. The plot was not cohesive at all. It jumped all over the place making the story very unpolished and uncomfortable to read. Sadly, when compared to its predecessors, this book was not a huge disappointment - it simply continues the trend of bad writing. Please do not waste your time with this one."
2,"Disappointing, but to be expected considering previous installments","Having gone through 5 prequel books I wanted to read this volume. Unfortunately, it is exceedingly difficult to get through.Plot and characterization are extremely shallow. Many things are repetitious. Not only the story and explanations, but even choice of words. For instance, if you see the word javelin, you just now that it's going to be paired with balista.As it is, apart from subject-matter, to me it has very little to do with the original series. And although it was never to be expected that it would, considering the sheer genius of the original series, it could have had such better treatment than it has got here.Viewed for and by itself as a book of science ficton, it just does not come up to par."
1,Could not stomach reading this,"I enjoyed all the first seven books written by Frank Herbert and a number of the books that followed by his son and collaborator, but this one, as well as the one that follows it -- Hunters of Dune -- are too distasteful to me to read at all. There were a couple before this that were hard to read but worse came to worse with this one and with Hunters of Dune. I simply cannot stand reading them. They are both so full of grotesque imagery, torture, etc. I am HOPING some of the following books are better because after enjoying the first ten books I purchased the entire set thinking I was going to like them all. Big disappointment. I would MUCH rather read the character studies and such I got from the previous books."
5,Yummy,"When I went to Barbados and discovered these rum cakes I never thought I'd eat them again unless I went back to Barbados.These are the best rum cakes I have ever had (and I am Caribbean.)They taste great and are a wonderful gift at Christmas for co-workers, people who drop by, and neighbors. I even gave one to the maintenance person who came to fix my oven the day before Christmas.Do yourself a favor, order a lot and keep them around. I will warn you now...it is hard not to eat them yourself."
5,Caribbean cake sooo good,"My husband was given a piece of this wonderful cake in his office and came home raving about it. He asked me to find it on the web and to order it. I found it on Amazon.Com and hoped it was the same one. Received it and found it to be so moist and tasty. We had ordered the smaller 6 pack mix,to try the different kinds so that in the future, wecan order our favorite one in a larger box.Thank you Amazon.Com for making it easier for us........Linda DiazNJ"
4,Yummy but VERY rummy,"I and my Husband go to Jamaica every 7-9 months so we love to pick up special things like this or Blue Mountain coffee each and every time. We recently ran out of all of our frozen goodies so we got these. We are normally creatures of habit but figured this would be a good way to try other flavors. Some of them (that I wasn't used to) seem extra rum infused than other and the ""flavor"" of each one wasn't as strong as I would have liked but they are still yummy. If you LOVE rum though; you will LOVE these."
1,Don't like taste,Taste like rum so if like rum you love but alo didn't like use to small to shre and too big for single serving. Like giant donut. The flavors in variety pack are gross to me
3,not as good as whole cake,"I purchased this after buying the 33oz original. Sadly it didn't live up to the large one. The rum flavor was weak, the cakes were not as moist & the flavors it came in were okay but not great."
2,painfull,"I loved the first two books in the series, could not put them down, even though they were far longer than the Blood of the Fold, I finished them in less than three days. But while reading this book, I find myself reading one or two pages at a sitting, and even then I am skipping over whole paragraphs to get through them (it is allmost painfull to read them). I have no idea what happend Terry Goodkind while writing this, but it is no where near the quality of Wizzards first rule, and Stone of tears. I am still going to get the next books in the series and read them, as I have faith that they will prove to be as good as the first two were (God I hope I am right)."
3,Better than the others,"Goodkind finally seems to be improving his writing style. This book is more of a straight-forward adventure novel, which is good. It's something Goodkind can write decently. He doesn't get burdened down with juvenile philosophy (there is a wizzard's rule, but it isn't important) or sappy emotion. This book also gives insight into Goodkind's world (neither of the first showed us anything). The ancient war is kind of cool, and the twist at the end with the mriswith was well done. This book is still not particullarly intelectual, and the characters are fairly flat, but as a purely entertaining hack-and-slash book, Blood of the Fold succeeds pretty well."
2,A waste of money....,"Except for a few spare moments in the book, this was one of the worst fantasybooks I ever read. No plot, stupid characters and an even dumber main character. How many Rules are there? I hope it will end soon."
3,OK,"My least favorite of the series, its still a good book but I feel it jumps around too much and it doesn't hold my attention as well as the first two."
1,A tale from the cuspidor...,Spit. That's what Goodkind boils down to. He's lame andboring. Steer cleer of this guy even if you have nothingbetter to do than eat asbestos.
3,KKK of the Magic World is Introduced,"Blood of the Fold is not bad, but I just didn't enjoy this one as much as the previous 2 for some reason. Maybe it is because some of the characters in this one just aren't very convincing. There was definitely more political debate, which seems to slow the story down some.I was really turned off by the Blood of the Fold group. These guys are the KKK of the magic world, and are just too stupid to be believable. Richard should have been able to brush them aside easily, but I guess you can credit their success to the allegiance to the Keeper.At least the story progresses. It is worth a read if you have made it this far."
5,"Fantastic, excellent, magnificent!!!","Terry, we want more, and more, and more.Not just this one, all of Goodkind is the very best literature I everread. Fantasy maybe even better than Tolkien's.Words can not describe my enjoyment in reading such fantasy, vivid in lifefull colors of hitherto unseen author's imagination.Story goes on and on, getting bigger and bigger with every page, making my muscles tense with action on pages, which is rare (for me, that is). Can't wait for new books."
3,Potential but disappointing,"This book had an awful lot of potential. However certain things should have been better thought out. I hated the concept he gave the Fold. They didnt seem as ruthless as first portrayed in the previous book. However, A lot of the plot twists are intriguing and leave the next book wide open. All in all, the book is interesting but really kind of a dissapointing. With Terry's idea of the Mord-Sith, we know he is capable of being ruthless. So lets see it Terry. Lets see how evil you can make the villians! This book was kind of lacking that hard edge. I hope the next book improves on it."
5,Learn current Banking Reality & What the Future Holds,"First off I am not a not an economist. Bought this book because I am very interested in how current monetary system works and what the future holds. This book fortunatly covers both topics; in great detail. The book goes over the advantages and disadvantages of the current way, how banks lend to grow the economy. It then goes over how that is being transformed and what we can expect in the future. The book is not as dry as most hard-core academic books, it is readible. My goal is to have a broad understanding of how the financial system of our world works, and this book did a great job of helping me understand. It does have a few advanced mathematical equations, I do not know how to solve them but they were very well explained...so at least I do understand what the equations are for. Great book it might be worth it to look for more books in the Raffaele Mattioli Lecture series."
5,For those of you who know and love this band..........,"My favorite album by these guys was Magnetic, a highly rocking album , by jazz standards. The only thing missing on the studio album was guitar, so to speak. Not a problem, add Mike Stern. This disc, answers THAT musical question in SPADES. This is one moving album, both tastefully and tempo-wise. You can't get ""Magnetic"" anymore, so get this. Email me if you hate it, I'll buy it from you. Guaranteed. Greg Watkins gwat@flash.net"
3,Audio dramatization way over the top,"This is a review of the BBC Radio dramatization version of this book.The story is a good one, filled with politics of religion, sympathetic characters and Dicken's inimitable prose.However, this audio version is WAY over produced, with blaring, overly-dramatic music that seemed reminiscent of the worst grade B silent films.The actors screamed, ranted, raved and wept hysterically more than they spoke. Unless someone already knows the basic plot and characters, they may have difficulty following the action (particularly, as a previous reviewer pointed out, the thick accents will be hard for Americans to decipher.).The entire production needed to be toned down quite a bit for Dicken's voice to be heard above the clamor.It might be better to read the book in this case."
4,Barnaby Rudge,"Barnaby Rudge is completely unlike all the other Dickens I've read, and that's why I think I didn't enjoy it quite as much - it somehow lacks that quintessential Dickensian quality.My chief grievance was the pacing - the first half of the book was meticulous development of the its myriad characters, and a little slow. Speaking of which, there were entirely too many villains, and they got a bit difficult to keep straight!That being said, when the book did pick up, I found it very difficult to put down. Dickens develops this terrifying, fixating painting of mob mentality. The fire, the attacks on the prison are truly gripping. I just wish we could have gotten to the interesting parts a bit sooner. :)"
2,What's another word for Thesaurus?,"Apparently Donaldson made an important discovery between the writing of his first and second Thomas Covenant trilogies: The existence of Roget's. I consider myself of at least average intelligence, but Donaldson managed to use a staggering number of obscure words whose meaning I either had to look up in the dictionary, guess at, or ignore. Far from adding to the book, his style comes across as affected - a criticism I wouldn't have applied to the first trilogy.Technique aside, the plot of this book simply couldn't hold my attention. The ingredients were there--a vastly different Land, an impossible voyage, so-called wild magic, even a love interest--but they seem to be nothing more than a re-hash of the previous trilogy. It's unusual for me to say this, but once having started this new series, I do not believe I'll read the next volume."
2,nothing special,"I went into reading SLAN perfectly aware of its age and inevitable naivete, and on that level it was fine. There's something charming about reading the past's view of the future.On the story and writing levels, however, I found this book terribly ordinary. I had just read Alfred Bester's DEMOLITION MAN prior to SLAN, and Bester's flair for writing and diction are far superior.If you have more books you'd like to read than you have hours in the day, pass this one for someting a bit more substantial."
4,Great for Price!,"I use this monitor for running and biking and I am very happy with its performance. The sensor strap fits snuggly and stays in place just under the chest. The directions recommend that you wet the sensor with some water before you put it on; I've done this every time and have had no issue with the transmission from sensor to watch. It clearly and accurately records my stats. The price plus the effectiveness of the monitor make this a winner purchase. My past Ironman watches have taken a lot of abuse and have lasted for a long long time, and so far this one's taking the same amount of abuse.NOTE: The brand name and the description for this product may lead you to believe that this heart rate monitor will work for swimming, but the instructions that come with this unit clearly state that the signal will not transmit if submerged in water."
4,Great Book at an unbeatable price,"To own one of (IMHO) the essential books on modern logic and philosophy for FREE is fantastic. It is thick going at times, but that's philosophy for you. Any easier and it would likely be the baloney which passes for logic nowadays. One curious omission is any title information beyond the name, I.e. Year of publication (1912)."
5,Bliss,"Though he may miss out and nonchalantly skip over a few subjects(which he apologizes for), Russell is excellent in explaining so much with so little."
5,the cube is fairly accurate,it is a great ice breaker to use. The storm part seems to be the one that doesn't fit.
4,Excellent but not perfect,"This is a soundtrack that was hoping to find in a store but couldn't, thanks a lot amazon.com. Shipping was fast but the music tracks were not in the same order as they are in the film. Small flaw that can be ignored. Whenever I need another soundtrack I'll certainly be coming back to amazon."
4,Dreaming With Natacha,Ovo je prava eksperimentalna poslastica koja ce vas uvesti u svet arapskog misticizma i ezoterije. Posebno obratite paznju na pesmu Yeranos.Album uz koji cete sanjati otvorenih ociju.
3,"Apparently, some confusion","I have recently bought the Village Green EP without having heard it before. I thought a band being inspired by the classic Kinks album must be a good idea and I had high hopes for a unique Kinks-sounding brand of rock & roll. They really don't sound like the Kinks to me and they definitely don't sound like ""The Village Green Preservation Society"". That isn't necessarily a bad thing, however, and the song, ""Get Up, Get Out, Get High"" is worth the cost of the EP. It is a fantastic romp that sounds like a classic, immediately. The confusion comes in with a description of the sound. They are described as sounding like Oasis and specefically Liam Gallagher. One of two things may have happened to bring about this description: 1. Either the reviewer had never heard the band Oasis or Liam Gallagher or 2. The reviewer had not really listened to the band the Village Green."
5,Love the exercise mat!,"This mat is big enough for aerobics (where you step around alot); dense foam & not too thick so you don't sink down too much, yet nice on the feet; doesn't move around hardly at all on the carpet (which I'm saving wear-n-tear on by using an exercise mat in the first place). Love it!"
2,Capable of Much More,"I've now read all of Jim Crace's work save his most recent novel (""All That Follows""). I'd have to say that ""Genesis"" falls, with a thud, to the bottom of the list. To be sure, Crace's writing skill is on display here; the guy can write. But, he decided on a cast of characters who were, by and large, neither likable nor interesting. As sometimes happens, it was possible to discern an interesting story at the heart of this novel, but the story was populated by largely shallow and vapid characters.To get a true sense of what Crace is capable of, I'd suggest ""Being Dead"", ""Signals of Distress"", and ""The Pesthouse"" as starting points."
2,A different twist on historical figures,"Entertaining, but historicaly inaccurate and sometimes silly."
1,George Will Doesn't Know......,"George Will is a pompous ass who knows even less about baseball than he does about politics. In this rag, he states something to the effect that Tony LaRussa is the perfect manager....that if you were going to construct the perfect manager you would end up with none other than Tony. What a crock. Just ask any Cardinal fan, who see his inept moves every day, what they think of LaRussa. I could name at least 50 managers that are more skilled. Go back to politics and your big words. You know nothing about baseball, George."
4,Great blackline masters,I lost this book and I am sad! There are a lot of great books to copy and send home here. They are easy to put together as long as you pay attention when you are copying and stapling them!
2,"A real disappointment, too much advertising","While I'm not necessarily sorry I bought this book, it is disappointing in many ways. It is poorly organized, carries a lot of hash from previous editions that's poorly integrated with the new material, and worst of all the tutorials require you to buy models from a third party vendor, rather than being supplied on the CD as the promotional copy leads one to believe. By the time I finished it, I felt like model supplier Zygote should have subsidized the healthy price tag, given the books total reliance on their expensive models. To make matters even worse, the included CD is poorly matched with the book, and doesn't contain what the books says it does. There aren't many alternatives to this book for the poser student, but ... I expected better."
3,Not enough Mars,"The DVD had a lot of interesting information about the development of the probes, but I had expected a lot more of the footage from Mars. But most of the scenes of Mars were studio recreations. So I was disappointed in the product, although the background information was interesting."
2,Not very exciting,There is less information in this presentation than the average Nova program. Even the Nasa Youtube videos can give a better science than this whole dvd. I expected a lot more from the people of JPL and Nasa.
2,connections between languages makes them easier to learn,"This book contains a lot of information on the ways european languages are connected, and how to use this to your advantage when learning other languages. The prejudices of the author show through fairly strongly, however, and the book contains a lot of outdated judgements of one language over another. The book contains some outdated information, and his reviews of Esperanto contain some easily verifiable errors of fact. The word lists in the back of the book are helpful."
4,Clever stories but not really detective fiction,"Intriguing short stories featuring a man who advertises for unhappy people and fixes their lives - for a fee. Contains Case of the Middle-Aged Wife, Case of the Discontented Soldier, Case of the Distressed Lady, Case of the Discontented Husband, Case of the City Clerk, Case of the Rich Woman, Have You Got Everything You Want?, Gate of Baghdad, House at Shiraz, Pearl of Price, Death on the Nile, and Oracle at Delphi. Apparently Christie really liked the title ""Death on the Nile,"" as this story is different from the Hercule Poirot book of the same title!Most of these tales aren't detective stories in the true sense of the word, but they are close enough - almost the other side of the coin - to appeal to people who enjoy detective stories, as Pyne plans to remove his clients' unhappiness almost as a criminal plans a heist. Very clever stories showing a remarkable understanding of human nature."
4,Nocturne_CVS@yahoo.com,"The title is a misnomer. Parker Pyne isn't a detective, he's more of a 'Mission: Impossible' guru. People come to him when they're unhappy, he gives them adventures. Unlike the previous reviewer, I liked the first 6 stories better than the last, when he does become a mere detective!"
3,Uncle not-so-wonderful,"I can't believe I've rated a Janis Ian recording at a 3 star! This album, however, is very different. I've played it over and over and gotten comfortable with some of the songs, but overall it just doesn't fit Janis' usual style. ""Uncle Wonderful' is a preview of two tracks regarding abuse on her more recent album 'Breaking Silence': ""His Hands"" and ""Breaking Silence"". The year it came out was 1985,when Janis' career, personal life and health were in dire straits. She even looks different. ""This Night"" is a teen angst song, other than that I can't bring myself to really enjoy the songs. They are technically fine, just not the Ian I'm used to."
1,Poor,"I found this over-argued and altogether recherche. There are clear indications, evident to any truly educated person, that Queen Elizabeth the First wrote the plays of the so-called William Shakespeare. This is true no matter what Brame, Popova and Mark Twain may say."
2,Eh,"Waste of money. Very large, no texture, and it's hardly cheaper than the real brand. Shipping wasn't as discreet as I would've liked, fortunately I got to the mail before the others in my family. The cock rings are VERY uncomfortable, and do nothing for me. Overall, I would not recommend buying this product."
2,Two by Johnny Mercer,"TEXAS LI'L DARLIN' with music by Robert Emmett Dolan and lyrics by Johnny Mercer was what we call a lucky hit. It opened on Broadway to mixed reviews but lasted 6 months due to the fact that only one other hit musical appeared that season (GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES.) Decca's 10-inch LP covered eight key songs from the mostly forgettable score. The record soon went out of print and by the 1970s was commanding $200 a copy or more. So this might be worth picking up as an ""investment.""The CD is paired with the short selection of songs Johnny Mercer and Gene DePaul wrote for a 1956 movie musical YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM IT. This was a musical remake of the 1934 oscar winner IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT with Junbe Allyson as the runaway heiress and Jack Lemmon as the reporter. The film wa not a success and the score yielded not hits but it's a pleasant listen. Stubby Kaye leads the singing in ""Howdy Friends and Neighbours"" while The Four Aces sing the title song."
3,nice shampoo,"I bought this to try to remove yellow build up on my hair due to well water and copper pipes. I don't think it has really worked to remove the yellow, but the discoloring is not getting worse, so maybe the shampoo is helping. The shampoo cleans my hair nicely and has a fresh citrus smell. Overall it's a decent shampoo, but I don't think it's removing the yellow from my hair."
2,Better than UltraSwim but I still smell like the pool.,"I swim five times per week. Even after using Malibu, I notice that my body (especially my hair) continues to smell like chlorine. In particular, even if I use Malibu, I notice a chemical ""chlorine"" smell when I sweat or get wet afterwards. The only thing that I have ever found that works for this problem is something called SwimSpray, which uses vitamin C. They have a website at [...]."
5,I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS WORK HIGHLY ENOUGH,"As anther reviewer stated, this is by far the best biography of R.E. Lee. Still, after all these years, no one has been able to top it. The four volumes cover the life and career of Robert E. Lee and do it in a manner that you simply do not want to stop. I enjoyed each and ever page of each volume. Freeman's research is almost beyond question and of course he had the advantage of being much closer to Lee (time wise) that other, more recent biographers. Freeman's style is extremely readable, particularly when you consider the era in which it was written. Yes, the four volumes are a bit intimidating when you look at them on the shelf, but is is quiet surprising how fast they read and how much important, interesting and useful information the author has packed into them. Strange as it may sound, these volumes are real page turners. Anyone interested in the Civil War and R.E. Lee in particular should indeed read this work. I highly recommend."
2,Flunk - For Sleepyheads Only,"Oh dear. Usually the Norwegian label Beatservice has good bands, but Flunk and their debut American release on Guidance, For Sleepyheads Only, don't quite make the cut. Their cover of New Order's ""Blue Monday"" feels lackluster, the female vocals wavy and weak. The male vocals on ""Miss World"" don't offer much of an improvement. Although ""See Through You"" matches the vocals to the music better, the instrumentals, like ""Sunday People (Don't Bang the Drum)"" are stronger -- but not by much. The album as a whole suffers from watered-down trip-hop syndrome. It might be pleasant to listen to overall, it really doesn't make any impression whatsoever."
4,squeeze at their best - great lyrics and melodies,Domino is a fine album that will never be as popular as it deserves to be. The Title song is incredibly catchy and addicting. Glen Tilbook's vocals across the album are spirited. It is an upbeat album that will please old-time and new squeeze listeners alike.
4,Squeeze Closes The 90s In Style,"While never attaining the commercial status they deserved, Squeeze can still put together a great album. Most bands can trace their creative high point to their early days, however, ""Domino"" proves that older, well-established groups can still be creative. ""Domino"" is perhaps their strongest album of the decade. ""Some Fantastic Place"" could be a contender. However, I found the band's most recent rhythm section to be their strongest in many years. The drumming was excellent. The percussion and bass lines melded well. Chris Holland added nice keyboards. In terms of songs, I most enjoyed the following songs: ""Play On"" ""What's Wrong With This Picture?"" ""Donkey Talk"" ""Sleeping With A Friend"" and ""Short Break."" Personally, I found Chris Difford's vocals on ""Short Break"" menacing, while the band's instrumentation helped to create the eerie atmosphere of the song. If you enjoy strong pop music...this is it."
2,What to do with this book?,"I may be hopelessly low-brow, but I really don't know what to make of this book. At the end of Chapter 1, the author writes:""But caveat lector, those in the know view the process as irreversible. What come out of the hole, the hole of this book that you must crawl into, will not be the same as what went in"". I have read all the way to Chapter 9, and I still don't get it. I may be dense, but aside from some interesting ideas, I see no hermetic initiation or anything justifying the self-serving paragraph I quoted above. In any case, I certainly was expecting at least an intellectual experience worth remembering. I feel I have been deceived and that the book is nothing more than an example of a kind of intellectuality that attempts to be esoteric and mysterious. Rather snobish, if you ask me."
4,Great subject!,"Nice way to connect wide range of topics. It has a typographical error or two, but it's a very good read."
2,my mistake,"ordered and opened, upen listening realized it was not what I wanted. I guess it's too late to do anything about it!"
5,Teen Age Music International,"I just saw most of this on PBS last night, and I think I'll pick it up - I bought some sort of a bootleg copy from Amazon a few years ago, but the picture quality is pretty bad. Just a couple of additional comments - the James Brown / Famous Flames and the Stones performances are worth the price of the DVD - amazing to see the the Stones' energy, Keith and Brian jumping around like some 70's punk band - plus they do my personal favorite Stones tune (although they didn't write it - it's by Bobby Womack), ""It's All Over Now"" - I'm pretty sure that's Darlene Love as one of Marvin Gaye's backup singers - twice, with Lesley Gore's ""It's My Party"" and the finale, the Stones' ""It's Alright"", all the performers come out and dance it up together - Jagger dancing next to Diana Ross! Chuck Berry dancing with Lesley! James Brown dancing with everybody! Amazing!"
5,Fabulous,"As soon as I watched my TAMI Show DVD, I ordered three more as gifts.The James Brown performance alone is worth the price. Or Marvin Gaye. Or Smokey Robinson.Love it, love it, love it."
4,Amazing but distracting...........,"After hearing Sting mention 'The TAMI Show' on 'When The World Is Running Down', I always wondered what must be on that tape to merit a mention in a pop song.The visual/musical content does not disappoint at all, and all the groups are at the top of their game. However the crowd noise/screaming is so overwhelming at times that I found myself hitting the mute button often.Still worth buying, though!HE"
3,BEWARE! NO RAY CHARLES!!! NO IKE AND TINA TURNER!!!,"WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE RE-ISSUERS?! (BUFFOONS). THIS IS NOT COMPLETE! RAY CHARLES' AND IKE & TINA TURNER'S PERFORMANCES ARE VERY CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT FROM THIS DVD!!! THEY ARE BOTH, TOGETHER WITH JAMES BROWN'S PERFORMANCE, THE ONLY GOOD SEGMENTS AT THIS CONCERT. SHAME! SHAME! SHAME! I'M SURE IT'S SOMETHING TO DO WITH COPYRIGHTS (GREED,GREED,GREED...!) ALL PARTIES INVOLVED WITH THIS RE-ISSUE ARE VERY STUPID TO FOIST THIS UPON US!"
1,Rip Off,"I saw the original TAMI show when it first came out and this version is not even close. The original version had many more shots of the dancers and performers that are not included on this version. The video quality is good, but the sound is terrible. If you are looking for the original version, this is not it. Don't waste your money."
1,"Way Overrated, Don't Do It!!!","Legendary is a word that gets thrown around like confetti at a wedding. On paper, the lineup for this show sounds incredible. But the actual goods are not delivered. Marvin Gaye sounds ok, the Beach Boys are very good, but James Brown got a lot better as the 60's moved on(see YouTube for the proof), and the Stones are out of tune and frankly, not very good. They got better as the decade progressed too. And the less said about the other acts, the better. This will appeal to aging boomers who rail about the bad music of today and want to relive their childhoods. Sadly, sometimes concert films should stay in the can, as is the case with this. The hype from the industry is of course impressive. At least the acts are live, so I will give it a star......."
5,"Great purchase, great price","I ordered this DVD on Amazon's pre-order option. It was a great price to begin with and with Amazon's price guarantee it went on sale for a few dollars less before I received my copy. Amazon automatically credited my account the difference, nice!The DVD itself is a very good quality restoration, almost HD like even though only on DVD. According to the nice enclosed booklet the original was shot in a HD like format, and it shows. No 5.1 audio, but then I guess 5.1 wasn't even a thought when this video was made, good quality stereo though.I'd highly recommend this DVD if you're into early to mid 60s music."
4,At last on DVD!,I can express my feelings about the release of this classic rock and roll concert in one word: Wohoo!
1,Its good for first year undergrad but not much after that,Has basic information and definitions about psych terms but once you get past the basics the book looses its value. Hasn't a clue about neuropsychology and info on theory is sparse.
1,Makes you smell really bad,"I have Candida and was taking this with other probiotics. It says to take 6 caps a day!!! I was taking 2 or three and after a month and a half my boyfriend couldn't stand to kiss me. I smelled like horrible garlic, and we love to eat garlic. Anoher friend said ""I smell garlic"" when I was two feet away from her! It may work but you won't have any friends afterward."
3,The Jury is Still Out on This One!,I've had Candida symptoms for almost a year now. I tried the product for 10 days along with a strict diet & nothing improved. I'm going to try it again for another 10 days to see if my symptoms improve.
1,Works until you try to boot without it. SUCKS,I am shocked that Netgear is providing an old driver (2004) NOT CERTIFIED WITH XP. Bought this Jan 2006. The crashing drove me crazy since nothing identified the driver as the problem until a day later through process of elimination.Wow. Netgear really blew it on this one.
4,Very Good Product,"I loved it, It worked very well, I didn't have any problems with the driver, It's very suitable for home & business use"
1,Not as pictured,"Read all of the reviews posted in hopes of getting this for my daughter who is an Elmo freak!! After reading the reviews I called the company to ask about the picture. Customer Service rep was nice but informed me that you did not get the Elmo pictured. She stated her supervisor told her they ""shipped what ever they had and she could not guarantee the one with the sweatshirt, pants, shoes etc."" In other words, count on getting the less dressed one that comes only with a t-shirt and a tacky dog---not at all how it is pictured! I will not order and risk $30 of Christmas money on a tacky gift."
2,Not as pictured...,"We recieved our Elmo today in the mail. What we recieved was not as it is pictured on the site. He just comes dressed in a t-shirt not the jacket ans shoes as it illistrates. He also says some funny things- like jump like a cat and a jump like a horse. I have read that it sometimes takes times for him to start speaking correctly, we'll see.Overall this toy is not worth the $40.00 I spent (including s&h;). Think twice before you buy."
2,Get the better one.,I bought this thinking it was the same as ones seen in the store. http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00080VMLS/qid=1133218239/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-5336909-7544609?v=glance&s;=toys&n;=507846This one only says her name. The other one does so much more for only $9 more. If you don't have a computer then buy this one. If you do don't waste your money. Now I have to buy that one too.
1,Buyer Beware !!!!,I ordered this item on 12/15 and was assured delivery before Christmas. It is now 12/27 and I still don't have it. This was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my son. When I contacted Babies R Us they told me I might not have it for several more days. So much for good customer service.
4,"The first one broke, but the replacement is great","The first one broke right after Christmas, but Toysrus.com was really nice, and sent me a new one. That made my son very happy."
1,Great Film Noir - Dissapointing Release,"The movie itself is a wonderful film noir and Laurence Tierney was born to play this part. Image Entertainment's release, on the other hand, is a disgrace. They are consistently using very poor images of great movies and sell them at overblown prices. 'Too Late for Tears', is another example to prove this point. I highly recommend Dark Crimes 50 Movie Pack. It contains 50 public domain movies on 12 DVDs (Hoodlum included) for about $16-$17. You get decent quality recordings at an unbeatable price. Image DVDs are not worth spending money on."
4,Pretty good,This book was pretty good. I felt in some parts it dragged on to long. Over all a excellent book.
5,Really good!!!,"I loved this book! I liked the futuristic aspect of it: my favourite part was when Tally and Shay were looking at some 300 year old magazines and saying stuff like ""But they're all ugly!"" and ""Since they didn't have the operation back then, they weren't ashamed of being ugly"".A real must-read (i suggest it for girls, although some boy might like it i guess)!"
4,beyond cool,this book was stellar! i loved the whole series really-except the ending to the specials was... nothing special really. it was more depressing.. but this and the pretties was awesome and anyone who is patient will lovvvvveeeeee it! i mean like srsly- u cant judge the book until its over!
2,Not really a teen book,"It took me quite a while to get around to reading this book, because it wasn't of great interest to me and when I did finally read it, I'm sorry to say, it didn't blow me away. In fact, I couldn't wait for it to be over. Things people said were ridiculously old and there is a poor attempt at romance. I liked the Midnighter's trilogy, but I gotta say, this wasn't good. I could see younger kids reading this (preteens) but I definatley don't consider it a teenaged book."
2,Ummmmmmmmmmmmm,"Ok, I am an avid book reader, but I have to admit, I was not impressed with this book. I read it while in a book club with some people at my school and I felt my interest fade within three days of starting it. I mean, it was a good enough plot, but I just felt my enthusiasm fade."
5,Kid's; This is the First Hunger Games. Sci-Fi at it's Best,"This right here, was an epic read.The writing was flawless. The plot spoke to me; about the way we must look after our planet and to accept ourselves as who we are and what we look like.Tally - I think - is a great Heroin. She is a determent girl that tries her best; even when things don't go well for her. But I honestly didn't like the way she betrayed her friends."
4,Uglies,"Scott Westerfeld's novel, Uglies, is a vision of the future. It's a young adult science fiction book and I found it entirely enjoyable. Tally is an almost 16 year old girl, who lives in a world of extreme beauty. Normal people are considered ugly. When they turn 16, they leave their old self behind, being an ugly, while they undergo surgery to become a Pretty. They get wider eyes, healthier skin, and fuller lips. It's all according to the formula of becoming very attractive. Even all their faults are being erased. Peris, her friend already turned pretty a month ago and she is dying to join him on the other side of the river, in Pretty town. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventures and is ready to learn more and more on each page. I am now determined to read other novels by Scott Westerfeld as well."
5,Kept me interested,This book grabbed me and didn't let me go. I'm onto the second one which I'm told is even better.
5,Great!!,I thought the book was very very good and entertaining. Kept me wanting to read more to fond out what was going to happen.
5,crazy good!,i fell in love wth this book by page 10. its fast paced and action packed. it also is probably going to be made into a movie this year :) very happy making
3,I have read better,I purchased the entire series just based on the reviews on Amazon. That was a huge mistake. The series is ok. This book is pretty detailed and I couldn't even get into it until about halfway through. I usually don't continue to read something that takes that long to keep my interest but since I purchased it I sort of had to read it. I won't read it again.
5,I loved it!!!,"I wasn't too sure about this book at first because I don't real a lot of dystopian books and things like that, mostly fantasy like Eragon and things. Joey Graceffa was the one who got me interested in them! I had a gift card from Easter and decided, why not buy it?When I started reading it, it was actually really interesting and I could hardly put it down! I just wanted to read all day in school! I would definitely recommend!"
1,I'd rather spend time in jail than read this book.,"Clumsily written, condescending to its target audience. This isn't a book; it's a product.No doubt The Uglies raises issues that are important for adolescents to talk about, but they don't need to read a badly written book to talk about these issues. Why did I, an adult, read it (or try to)? Because my son and his friends were complaining bitterly about being assigned this work. Fortunately these kids like to read, but being assigned this book struck a blow against that precious enjoyment.With hundreds of well-written books in print--some of which raise similar issues--why would schools assign this artless and punishingly long production?"
1,I'd be more inlclined to take this Amazon rec...,"...if it weren't completely apparent that this book rips off its premise from two classic ""Twilight Zone"" episodes: ""Eye Of The Beholder"" and ""Number 12 Looks Just Like You."" I think Rod Serling's 40+ year-old versions of this little morality tale will probably have far more resonance for me (being that they were first). Did the authors really think no one would notice?"
5,Uglies,I loved this book. I read it in three days so it's an accomplishment for me. I don't read books very fast as all my friends will tell you. This is one of the best books I've read and it was great. I can't wait to buy the sequal.
4,Uglies,"I thought this book was good. It had a great premise. I had a problem with how the author named things, though. It felt like he always just added -ies to the end of every group of people. Rusties. Smokies. Uglies. Pretties. Even Littlies? Its a good book, maybe a little predictable, once you get past the names."
5,"Uglies, anything but","I bought this book on the recommendations I found online and I'm really glad I did. The synopsis has already been well described here. I just want to add my ""thumbs WAAAY up"" to all the other glowing reviews. As I read this book, I kept thinking of how the concept of beauty changes so much over time. I wonder what will be considered beautiful in 300 years (about the time this series is set). I was also wondering who got to decide what was beautiful when the operations started, and had it evolved over time. Interesting things to ponder as you read...but making you think is what really good fiction should do."
2,flat and dull characters ruins the premise,"The premise was interesting, but none of the characters have any personality! Everyone in this novel is 2-dimensional, making them utterly boring. I can't take any more of this, I won't continue with the rest of the series"
3,Uglies are... Normal???,"We read this book in school. I , like always, read ahead. I finished the book on the second night. The first thing someone in my class said was ,""I don't wanna read this!!! It's a girl book!!!!!"" Never, ever , ever judge anything by its cover!!!!!!!!!"
2,Disappointing,"Predictable story lines, simple characters. For far better young adult dystopian reads try The Giver, The hunger games and The divergent series."
1,Do not buy!,"Thea used to be one of my favorite authors, but after this last book, I'm changing my mind. This book should have been classified as a mystery, not erotic fiction. Her older stuff used to make me blush. Now I wish I'd spent my $14 on something else. Don't waste your money!!"
4,Non squeeker but loved by my doggie,I own a whippet who loves chasing after things -- especially playing with a ball. I've found she's much more fond of going for the Air Kong football than a normal ball partly because of the size and partly because of how the football bounces on the turf and really makes her chase it. She (and her owner) enjoy the workout she gets from playing with this thing.
5,A GREAT READ!!,"This book is a page turner! It's filled with murder, action, humor and steamy sex. Lynn and Jess are a fantastic couple who along with Lynn's teenage daughter, Rory, try to escape a group of murdering religious fanatics and stop them from killing others. What a story! You'll love it. Trust me!"
2,Ick,"I read this book because the author.was.recommended for Karen Rose fans. I was not impressed. Lynn was entirely unlikeable, from her snotty attitude to her unkindness to people and animals, as was her daughter. The whole adventure was unbelievable and poorly researched. Just overall not a great book. Am I supposed to cheer when a totally snotty cow gets a great guy at the end even though she treated him like dirt until he kissed her? Really?"
5,"Once again, the best song the DMB has ever produced!","This is undesputedly the best song the Dave Matthews Band has ever produced. It combines lively lyrics with upbeat music. The first song ever put on a recording with 27 snare beats, a pivotal song in the music industry and now available to you in both the live and the album versions!"
5,TOTALLY AWESOME,"I read Girl only because I was supposed to have coffee with Blake Nelson and I wanted to see if he was a total wack job or not(he's not). I just loved it. I loved Andrea, I loved every thought that passed through her head, I loved every situation she got herself into. I only wish I hadn't read it so fast. I wish Blake would write ten thousand more books in Andrea's voice, I really do, I would read every single one."
1,Don't be fooled by the reviews,"I was psyched about ordering this book when I saw that amazon compares it to The Perks of Being A Wallflower. I am horribly disappointed. This book is completely inaccurate. I don't know why people keep saying it is a ""very realistic point of view"" etc. etc. If anyone accepts that teenage girls are this shallow, trite, and just plain asinine they are sadly mistaken. Not to mention that is this book is horribly written. It's one long, boring, pointless run-on sentence. I hate this book. I recommend The Perks of Being a Wallflower of this novel any day."
5,Girl,This is by far the best book I have ever read. When I was through with it I passed it around to all of my friends and they agreed. I don't see how anyone could have not liked it.
4,hmmmm... written by a man,"How on earth can a man get inside the head of a teenage girl? Well, he attempts & pretty much succeeds. I was impressed. But he doesn't quite hit the mark on several topics, mainly sex. I was brought back to my teenage years (15 years ago) & the ""scene"" was pretty much the same. I really loved the book but I'm embarrased to because it seems ""frivolous"" & ""teenage"" reading, but I don't care. Bravo Blake Nelson. Now can we have it from a ""real"" female's perspective"
5,Excellent read for all ages,"I received ""Girl"" as a chance encounter and could not put it down from the moment I first picked it up. I found the characters to be as real and interesting as any I have read about. Andrea is a very believeable character and the whole book has a very somber feel to it. I truly hope that the author will give us a part two to the novel so we can continue to enjoy the adventrues of Andrea as she enters college. By the way using a Krokus song in the novel really took me back as they were one of my favorite bands in high school."
3,actually not bad!,"basically a guy who gets friends together and makes some pretty cool videos. looks like they tried to do stuff that hasnt already been done on the web, which is quite hard!"
1,"I love Ray, but this is a terrible cd.","I'm a big fan of Ray, so when I saw this used at a local store, I grabbed it. I only paid about $4 for it, but if I had paid any more, I might have demanded a refund. This is the worst-sounding cd I own. Ray is there with all his genius, but the problem is that both his voice and his piano sound like they're at the end of a long tunnel, while the ""overdubs"" sound perfectly clear. The cd says on the back that ""additional overdubs"" were added, but it doesn't warn you that they're performed by a man with mediocre (at BEST) talent and that the cd sounds like it was mixed at random by someone who was almost completely deaf."
1,Just a sequence of random code,"I downloaded a sample of this book on my Kindle for PC. It is really awful. I just saw a sequence of random. No math nor readable text. If I didn't see a picture in the middle of page, I wouldn't know this was a sample book!!"
5,I hope this is the first book of many by Z Gartenberg,"Doesn't every family who encounters autism come at it differently?I went to high school with Zachary & Mori's uncle. I knew about the book, but had never seen it for sale. I was so thrilled when their grandmother pointed out where I could get ""their"" book. It's a loving book about a loving family. My own daughter is autistic. In part, I bought the book for a classroom school library -- I am also a special educator-- to share with other parents of disabled kids.I will eagerly read anything else Zachary writes about his brother and family."
5,Quirky book about living,"A novel about the tangled lives of small town folks both young and old and the relationships that evolve among them. A story that brings together people from various places and stages in their lives - Amelia, an older woman who recently lost her sister; Agate her young, pregnant housekeeper; Cole Amelia's grandnephew; Dina, the used furniture dealer; and Rosemary, the town social worker to name a few. Throw in some humourous misunderstandings, and this makes for some interesting reading."
3,Review,"Remembering Babylon, which is written by David Malouf and is the winner of the 1996 International Impac Dublin Literacy Award, is the story of a white british boy, called Gemmy Fairley, who lands someday on the Australian coast and then is raised by a group of Aborigines. The story takes place in the mid 1840's and contains many lyrical passages ,which make it difficult for the reader to understand the plot, especially a German school class. All in all it's a very poetic novel,which visualizes on the one hand the civilised world and on the other hand the primitive world impressively."
1,May need to return a couple,Calculator is great if it works. I've had to return 2 so far. The third one is working nicely.
5,Wonderful Wonderland,Loved the movie. Kept me intersted since it is not the old Alice story which I am familiar with. And when has Johnny ever let me down! A bit gruesome in parts for the very young but no where as bad as some of today's video games.
4,Alice In Wonderland BLURAY,"This might be a little difficult for a younger child due to the content. Overall, the acting is good."
1,If you are going to mess up a story mess up a story.,The movie was beautiful but the story sucked. Grown up Alice a was completely different person from child Alice. I read both Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass. This movie was highly disappointing. I thought that it would follow the book since the original Disney movie varied from the book so much. I prefer completely retelling a story than twisting a story around. I like the Alice by SyFy channel far better because it did not mislead you into thinking that it was in anyway related to the book.
2,... it was just boring,"1. Although I tend to like most Johnny Depp films (esp Charlie Chocolate Factory etc...) and this film was visually amazing, in the end a good film is based on solid writing and solid acting... which this film sorely lacked in. Bottomline, the movie seemed that it had everything going for it (special effects, the classic story, famous actors)... but it was just plain boring, I'm mean really boring. Out of the three family members who started to watch this film, no one finished it. Even my kid who waches almost anything, was so completely bored with this film that he just went on to do other mundane things. Bottomline, if you value your time, skip this dud."
2,Alice in Regularland,"I expected a little more from Tim Burton. Great visuals, but a not so fun plot."
2,Burtons ego gets in the way.,"I hated this film.Alice upgraded to angsty teen to be more commercially appealing, allowing her to have some kind of flirty relationship with the Hatter. Hatter turned into a pseudo heroic figure to accomodate Depp's image. Ending with a battle between good and evil. Ho hum.Burton had a chance here to make the greatest ever version of the greatest ever children's story. Instead it's a rampant tribute to his own ego.He seems to be under the illusion that his imagination and inventiveness are equal to Carrolls. It ain't.if the film had been called Tim Burton's Alice, I might have worn it. As it is, it is a huge disappointment that it is not the original story.A golden opportunity thrown away by the arrogance of a grossly over rated director."
3,Not up to Burton/Depps usual standard,"As usual a very wonderful visual feast from Burton, but where this fell down so very badly was the story. It was a pedestrian coming of age/becoming a hero story which has been done a thousand times before, missing the crazy nonsense of the Carroll original. The actors were all good, especially Mia, but without the lunacy they seemed to have little to do. The closest film I can think of in recent times which was like Alice, but not an straight adaptation (like this film was attempting to be) was Labyrinth, with its illogical puzzles/wordplay and endearing characters.Not one I feel the urge to buy straight away. Get one of the straight Alice adaptations which have graced the TV instead."
3,Not happy,We have tried watching this movie over and over. It will just stop and turn green and you have to stop the movie and just wait till another day to see if it will decide to want to play. We use Blue-ray player and the reguler dvd player.
1,"HORRIBLE, SAVE YOUR $$$","It's no wonder the studios decided to convert this ""movie"" into 3D - with no plot, weak acting, and pitiful directing, if it had been released in 2D, audiences might have noticed how crappy this thing is instead of being distracted by colorful 3D images. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
5,Amazing Visuals!,"The 3D visuals for this movie was amazing. It was better than any 3D movie I had seen in theaters. The story was edited and somewhat different from the original book, but still entertaining."
2,Tweedle dumb...,"I usually like Tim Burton's films, not really because of the stunning dialogue - but because they are visually surreal and have an unusual beauty.This movie was not a Lewis Carol adaptation... why? because his 'Alice' is a sweet, little, and very innocent girl of 7-13 years old...When did an ADULT Joan of Ark get cast as part of this Children's Tale?... HUH?!Horrifying to be named ""Alice in Wonderland"" ... it should be named ""Mythical Place of Insecure Older Woman's Fantastical Redemption"" ...Yikes..."
1,Not even worth the free shipping!,I wont waste my time writing too much about this movie.. Johnny Depp should be embarrassed by this performance... I admit I'm not a big fan of TIm Burton but this has to be his worst to date...
1,Alice is wasting time,"a movie with excess imaginationjust cant swallow it , fake story , and lack of action ,horror , fun or any of these must bein a movie"
4,Another decent Tim Burton remake,I saw this at the iMax with some friends with very low expectations. The movie itself was good escapist entertainment and predictable. The blu-ray itself was a good transfer and has some good extras. I'd rent before buying but if you're not expecting a Pixar quality film you probably won't be too disappointed with this film.
3,Ok 3D movie,"Ok 3D movie.Not alot of off screen jump outs,but it's way better to watch in 3D then it is in 2D...makes the movie more fun..The 3D starts to get your attention when Alice enters wonderland..I give the movie 4 stars and the 3D 3 stars."
5,Great bizarre movie,This dvd is a very bizarre but very good movie to watch certainly a bit dark for children of a younger age groupl For them I would hope parents use the Disney version of Alice in Wonderland. This one is definitely a dark one. Yes this one is Disney too but not the animated one. I would strongly suggest that very young viewers watch the animated version of Alice in Wonderland then grow into this one.
2,Anne Hathaway casually out-quirks Johnny Depp and Crispin Glover,"Comme Ci, Comme Ca.Anne Hathaway casually out-quirkied Johnny Depp, who was mostly retreading and reusing old mannerisms, and Crispin Glover, who was handicapped by his costume. Mia Wasikowska held her own as Alice against the heavyweight stars. Visually; the movie looked good but didn't break any new ground. I was actually most impressed by the slowly growing mushrooms and vines framing the end credits. Lovely."
1,Unhappy customer!,"I'm sure the movie is great, but I am not able to view it from this purchase because the seller did NOT include the DVD!! and that was what I had hoped to view!!!"
1,Mystery Oil - It is anything but olive oil,My wife says that it does not taste like olive oil. She is Italian. She knows what real olive oil tastes like. We put a small amount in the fridge. It would not freeze or thicken for anything. Real olive oil is supposed to thicken when cold. The company even lied to me by telling me that the olive oil tests on the internet which labeled Colavita as fake were because they used old batches of Colavita. I was stupid enough to believe them. Colavita is owned by the mafia. Do not believe anything they tell you.
4,Christian fascism takes over U.S. ...sound familiar?,"I love Octavia Butler's daring,caring and strong people who transform her bleak scenarios into hopeful tales of human potential. The theme of the unresolved oppression that continues to breed slavery is never far from her mind or pen. This book is striking to read because although Butler published it in the late 1990s, the danger of future of a U.S. run by Christian fascists led from the White House seems more more real than ever.For a factual recent history of Christian theocrats in the U.S. read Esther Kaplan's recent book With God on Their Side, and for a trenchant analysis of the philosophy and social base behind this madness read Avakian's Preaching From a Pulpit of Bones, another prescient work from the 1990s."
3,"Pretty good, but not what I expected...","As a fan of northern New Mexico as well as our nation's atomic history, I was expecting a bit more than this superficial look at the life of Edith Warner and her impact on the Los Alamas/San Ildefanso areas. While it's pretty good at conjuring up mental imagery, the writing is not terribly smooth. This is probably because Ms. Warner didn't appear to leave a very large diary, so the rest is filled in by the personal commentary of Ms. Pond Church who was a sporadic visitor to the ""house"" at best during the period and writes in a very different style than Ms. Warner. All in all, I just didn't feel it ever got to the heart of Ms. Warner's story, but it was a nice ""read"" nevertheless."
3,Class textbook?,I bought this book because I would like to learn to cut basic haircut at home without going to beauty school. I figured maybe this book has a step by step techniques from comb and scissor to clippers... Not really. It's actually a textbook that explained general terminology of hair cutting process..not what I was looking for..I was looking for book that would show me what type of haircuts and it's step by step process and techniques to accomplish such haircut. But other than that this book is okay for general lesson of barbering.
4,"Great for MJ fans, not bad for non-fan either","A book filled with comments from MJ's peers and celebrity admirers. Would've liked more, but a good one to add to your collection."
3,anam cara,overall the book isnt bad but it needs a good edit. the first half of the story moves way too slowly and the characters are unrealistic... both women arent just attractive they are the most beautiful anyone has ever seen with the most glamourous jobs etc... but once the plot starts advancing it becomes a much better read. the characters dont grow and develop enough but the story is engaging and you do end up rooting 4 them. with a cracker jack editor and one more draft it would be good book. i enjoyed it... just wanted a bit more meat.
4,Keratolux shampoo review: similar results to Malaseb shampoo.,"We purchased this brand as a replacement for DVM's Malaseb shampoo on recommendation from our vet. We use the shampoo for our pet dog and are satisfied with the results. Additionally, our dog's coat no longer has a post-bath medicinal scent.Malaseb is a difficult product to replace. While Keratolux is not made of same chemicals, the results with our pet have been similar, which is what I would hope to find in a review.This review is written before testing against our dog's worst allergy season, July-December/first frost.hope this helps."
3,post-punk? pleasures,"listened to this album quite a bit as a teenager.never got much out of it content wise but p.i.ls music/arrangements to me was interesting and motivating - this album included.mr. lydon should be lauded to the extent he arranged and composed the music. like i said, it was good music that pleasantly went beyond the sex pistols material.especially fond of the manic-y rhythm in annalisa. excellent song."
3,Green Asante Samuels Jersey,"Though this is a nice Jersey, Sewn on letters apposed to decal/iron on numbers found on a replica jersey.The green is not the green on the Philadelphia Eagles. It is a bright green, not their teal."
2,New Ideas for Read a louds,"This book would be helpful for teachers who still have time in school to celebrate the holidays or for curriculum that studies various cultures and this could be built into part of that unit. It just didn't fit my needs and I felt is was not as user-friendly. Visuals of the various book, graphics to break up the text would have made it easier for a busy teacher to skim and find what they need."
4,"Excellent book, no maps","This is a very good one-volume history of World War II in the Pacific. It is fast-paced, easy reading, and balanced. The author covers all aspects of the war with roughly the emphasis they deserve, shifting back and forth from the high councils of strategy to homely events on the front lines of this brutal, bitter conflict.""Eagle against the Sun"" won't get my highest rating, however, because of its lack of maps. The inside cover has a general map of the Pacific -- and that's all folks. How can a publisher put out a book that contains hundreds of obscure place names and descriptions of complex military maneuvers without at least a dozen detailed maps to illustrate the text? The lack of maps diminishes what would otherwise be an outstanding book."
4,Strategic Decisions,"If you're looking for a book about battles and fighting, this isn't the book for you. If you want a look at generals and statesmen struggling to find a way to victory, you'll enjoy this book. It tells the tale of how victory in the Pacific was found and fashioned. The disagreements between the services, the personal chemistry, the problems with logistics, the balancing of needs versus the fight with Germany, all these important issues are explicated in 'Eagle against the Sun'. It's not exhaustive in its treament of the war and not exhausting in the reading.It's a very good book to start analyzing World War II in the Pacific theater."
5,Excellent One Volume History of Pacific War,"A very readable, interesting history of the Pacific theater in World War II. Despite being a single volume Spector does a masterful job of covering all the key aspects of the Pacific war and does so in a very complete manner. The earlier reviewers comments about the lack of maps is true; you might want to have an atlas handy while reading this book. Definitely worth your investment several times over in both time and money."
4,Great book...but where are the maps?,"For those who are interested in the WW II Pacific campaign, and want it in a concise volume, this book is it. Spector does an outstanding job of pulling together a plethora of sources, and boiling them down to explain otherwise-complex battles and strategies. If he had included maps in his book it would've rated a 10, but because he didn't (probably to reduce the overall number of pages) the book is a little incomplete."
4,Vivid descriptions,"This glossy book has some of the ambience of a computer magazine and a Sharper Image catalog. Very visually appealing. There has been careful attention to make what might often be bland subjects like optimising your file view or removing unnecessary DLLs into something that grabs your attention.While I compared it to a magazine or catalog, I should add that there is a lot of solid material here, that is technically accurate. Plus the choice of topics is clearly contemporary. You are shown how to overclock, which helps gamers, amongst others. Or, you can see how to use your PC for digital photography or digital video. These are now burgeoning fields, as photography and film both make the transition to digital formats. The authors are hitting all the prominent market segments for a consumer PC.Though, after reading the book, you might yearn for the quiet of a plain black and white printed page."
4,A classic,"I'll never have enough of Bill Cosby. I was worried that my dvd couldn't be played in my country (it was a region 1 dvd), but it's fine. And the best part is that it was delivered all the way to my place (outside US)"
5,A classic,"Should be seen by all parents to be. It also pays back for empty nesters. Fun without 4 letter words, what a joy."
5,outrageously funny,"I saw this video at a friend's house. We were laughing so hard, we were in tears. I had to buy it for myself and show other friends. My best part was the one on alcohol and the dentist. Last week I was getting a root canal at the dentist and when I saw smoke coming out of my mouth I started to gigle because I remembered the video. Needless to say my dentist was concerned if I was alright. After all, who laughs at the dentist's chair!!"
5,"Critical, suppressed information",Biological TransmutationsThis vintage book clearly demonstrated that Modern Chemistry is being taught while missing a major link. That a chicken who is starved of calcium can consistently make calcium for new eggs shows that ALCHEMY occurs in biological systems. There are many other examples.Unlocking the minds of our thinkers could have impact on other issues like nuclear waste remediation through transformation.
4,INCREDIBLE,What are you waiting for? rent or buy this todayit is too badass to put into words.. and I would not want to spoil anything..
3,pretty good but not really great,"I watched this movie on Netflix. I don't think I'll buy the DVD because I don't think I'd ever watch it again. This movie is long. It has some gore but a fair amount of off camera violence, that I didn't like. I hate it when they pull the punch. So if your looking for a gore fest this is kinda a let down. Also the ending was stolen from another film. Check out my YouTube channel veryfinecrapvideos."
2,Moderate. Not the high mark of Will Durant,"The book is a collection of interviews and articles in interaction with the great writer, but the subject depth is lacking and there is little cohesion."
1,verbal diarrhoea,"the content was fascinating and definately worth reading in hard copy form, but the audio c/d was a nightmare. The narrator must have been hiring the recording studio by the minute because he read at a breakneck pace. At first it was acceptable , but soon became difficult to follow then tedious and annoying. The speed of the reading allowed for no digestion or comprehension of points , and soon was down right frustrating. As a consequence the second and third c/d's were almost a waste of time, I doubt if i could force myself to listen to it again, unless there was a way of play back at half speed."
3,thick as glue,"This title is misleading. There are moments of wit strewn throughout but getting to them is like slogging through glue. A few funny lines exist but the humor is lifeless. There are dozens of names with no more than a mention, and many notable names are obvious by their omission. A fair read but laborious. It seems that the writer is more interested in self entertainment than the experience of the reader."
3,"Interesting, but not particularly well written.","The subject matter and content are good, but the writing style is a bit exhausting. A better editor and more thought to organization would have made this an excellent book."
5,beautiful music,"loved the entire album. unusual music, but very addictive and intriguing. ""sama guent guii"" - by Youssou N' Dour is my favorite and makes me cry. its beautiful."
5,Music to last Generations,"Nothing--absolutely nothing--brings me back to the wonder and delight of my childhood Christmases like ""A Christmas Together."" We listened to this record over and over as kids while decorating the Christmas tree. And now, I have a one year old son and just this morning, we listened and danced to this incredible collaboration. The soothing sounds of John Denver and the tender zanyness of the Muppets strikes the purest chord within me. Though I love the traditionals, the songs which make this CD so special to me are ""When the River Meets the Sea,"" ""The Peace Carol,"" and ""It's In Everyone of Us."" The warmth and message of these songs still bring tears to my eyes. There is no question--my generation (I'm 24) holds this incredible team dear to our hearts. I hope we can pass this love onto our children."
2,Where are my favorite songs?!?,"I bought this CD specifically for my father who loves ""Where the River Meets the Sea"". I guess I didn't read far enough down on the reviews to find that is NOT on this CD. There should be something to let people know that this is NOT the same as the LP version - there are 3 songs missing! I'm highly disappointed."
2,Wasted my money on a whole album for one song.,"I bought this album for the ""twelve days of Christmas."" The rest of the songs are annoying so I wish I just downloaded the one song I liked."
3,Love this kind of Christmas music,"I grew up listening to the ""John Denver and the Muppets Christmas Together"" CD and have always loved it. This year I couldn't find mine so I decided to order a new one. While I was at it I ordered a few extras for my daughter to give them to her little friends as Christmas presents. Well, they arrived quickly, the price was great, but I was somewhat disappointed when I realized this CD is missing some of the original songs-some of my favorites. I'm not sure why they aren't on this disc, it was a really short cd without them. So, the songs that are on it are great-I would give them 5 stars, but the length of the CD and the missing songs are what make me give it only 3 stars."
5,Joni's Favorite,"This is probably my favorite Christmas album of all time!I couldn't believe it when the album came out,John Denver and the Muppets, two of my favorites together!I am glad to get the collectors edition."
5,PERFECT,I LOVE THIS DVD! IT IS MY FAVORITE CHRISTMAS DVD. I HAD TROUBLE FINDING IT IN ANY STORES. I WAS SHOCKED THAT I FOUND IT ON AMAZON AND AT A VERY REASONABLE PRICE. I WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE. THANKS AMAZON.
4,always been a Muppets fan,I'm 53 years old and always been a Muppet fan. I will have to say that Mannhiem Steamroller is my favorite for Christmas music. There are some really good songs on here and the rest are good. I'm not typically a John Denver fan but I do like this album.
5,Step by step archaeology,"Nice walk through of what was done in the the greatest archaeological find of last century.I plan to read the next two volumes (of 1927 & 1933) as well. The tomb entrance was discovered Nov. 4, 1922. By mid-Feb. the Antechamber was cleared and the door to the Sepulchral Hall was penetrated. (Vols. 2 & 3 address the clearing of the Annexe, S.H., and store chamber.)"
1,Not enough detail in discoveries.,"I did now wish for this book at all. Even though it was written by the man who discovered the tomb, I don't believe it. There must be another Howard Carter out there who wrote the book. It seemed like a kindergarten schoolboy could write this book. The pictures (which aren't even good) take up most of the book because the author probably didn't know what to right. Take my advice and put this book back on the shelf where you got it. It doesn't even deserve a ""1"" rating, if there were negative ratings, then I would give it a -13. Horrible is the only word to describe it."
5,A gift for a WWII vet,...bought this for a WWII vet that flew the L-5 Sentinel in Okinawa. He thoroughly enjoyed it -- even the impossible flying scenes like where the L-5 was flying upside down which is a neat trick for a plane with a gravity feed fuel system. If you're an L-bird fan you'll enjoy this movie.
3,Relax for an Hour During the Holidays,"A straightforward rendering of Christmas classics. Performed by the Simbah Chamber Collagium, the songs are neither half-baked or overwraught. As such, there is no real wow factor to the selections, but there is nothing to discredit in the preformances. The songs are well-produced with a consistent quality throughout, and the album length is a full hour. If you're sick of the 72 hours of Christmas they play on the holiday airwaves, Acoustic Christmas Reflections is an easy-listening choice for background play. Relax and take a break during your Christmas Break while you listen to acoustic reflections."
3,Expected More,"Overall this was a great CD. One thing that really bugged me was the last cut that continues to be re-done, it seems endlessly. It took some of the joy I had for this CD. I realize that this was added, but they should have left it out altogether."
5,The Evolution of House,"Every so often, house takes an evolutionary step. Sometimes it hearkens to the past, like Daft Punk's lo-fi funk. At other times, it points to the future, like Basement Jaxx' 'Remedy.''Night Works' IS the future. The basslines are direct, the percussion loose yet exact, the melodies moving. They do a great job of combining a live-band's flair with sequenced, thoughtful musings. The whole album resides in the realm of groove, both uptempo and downtempo. 'All Night Long' is the big club hit off the album, and deservedly so, but the true high point is ...I can't say - you'll have to find out for yourself."
1,wow did I get sucked in: total waste...,"This book is applicable to anyone with tons of cash to spare on a party hosted in 1954. As a caterer, I was looking for inspiration, but sadly, only found jello and marshmallow themes pervasive throughout the entire book. Not worth the paper it is printed on!"
5,Wonderful!,I loved this book! Mariel opens her heart to her readers and lays it all on the line. I identified with her and was able to learn some new methods for handling some areas of my life that parallel hers. This is a wonderful and sincere book!I hope that in the future she writes a book on yoga and that she writes another book where this one left off.
4,Yoga in real life,"I am not sure what I expected, but I was pleasantly pleased by A Memoir with Yoga. It was interesting to read about her life - but even more interesting was how well she described the asanas. I have a new approach to some of them (remembering her giggles at the cat and dog poses - and that some yoga is FUN), and will concentrate on moving into a pose with her words in my mind. I learned more about yoga from the book than expected, and it was a joy to read."
1,not recommended,"Do not waste your money - I've had one for over 6 months. Every week or so, my hubby has to tighten bolts spray silicone everywhere. It's VERY noisy, squeaking, grinding, wobbling. A real piece of crap."
1,lousy,"I was very disappointed. The book read as if the author was speaking---which apparently wasn't at much higher than a high school level. To me it was offensive to african americans--just because one is of color, it doesn't mean they use the cliche black slang that this author chose to use."
3,The ending let me down alittle,"As far as the topic, it seemed very familiar however, that wasn't the problem. The problem was the ending and the child's reaction to the events taking place. I know we sometimes want a snappy ending, cool dialog after a climatic scene--TV does that to us, however, in this case the child's reaction was not realistic and hit me wrong. I won't remember much else about the book except the vision of a child speaking as if her heart was as cold as steal. Perhaps if this was Mr. Baisden's point, I'd be okay...I saw the BAD SEED, that child was evil to the BONE! However, I didn't think that was the point being made in this story, however, in the end, the child turns out to be no less a maniac than the femme-fatale."
4,Watch out for that one night stand,"WOW!! Is all I could say after I finished this book. Are there really woman out there that crazy. This book starts with the end and then takes over the last year of Julian's life in Houston. He has a one night stand with a friend of a friend who turns out to be the craziest chick on the planet but I have to admit she went to all extremes to get her man. Even though the ground rules of the ""relationship"" are set out from the beginning Olivia has no plans on letting Julian get away and will do ANYTHING she has to to keep him. She believes in the old saying, If I can't have you, no one can. It's definetly any interesting turn of events. I love the way he drops little clues on you that make you want to go back and read the book again to see how you missed the little clues of what would come next. Once again Michael Baisden has found a way to keep my interst throughout the whole book."
5,Michael Baisden is a wonderful writer,I believe he's writing from experience and was able to put his words on paper and follow his dreams. GREAT READ!!!
3,"I knew it was going to be off-da-hook, but when..........","It took forever to get to the point I enjoyed Michael Baisden's books. I knew it was a matter of time, the story seemed to go very slow and then quickly and dramatically climaxed at the end. The ending of the book was off-da-hook. I just felt nothing until it got to that point. I still give him 2 thumbs up for the effort and an outstanding ending! Will read more of his other books."
5,The Makings of a great movie,God's Gift to Women was a very good read.While I was reading it I thought this would make a great movie.I rate this book with 4.5 *It kept me wanting to know what would happen next. This book is definitely movie making material.
2,Wham! Bam! No Thanks for the QUICKIE Mr. Baisden!!!,Been there! Read this before...Mr. Baisden has such great potential; I have followed him from book one. This book has all the makings to be a great story but it is just too quick! I keep visualizing Angela Bassett and Martin Lawrence in a movie similar to this story...This story was just too predictable. I am praying that Mr. Baisden's 'broadening' does NOT affect his writing skills so that he becomes another commercialized-money-generating writer that we already have too many of! Want some intrigue? try BLACKFUNK!
2,Predictable,"I have read all of Baisden books but this one was too predictable. It may be a great read for some people, but this book should have had some kind of suspense. As soon as he met Olivia it was obvious what was going to happen. I read the book in a day, but only because I am a fast reader. This would have been better as a short story for teenagers without such explicit parts."
3,Julius Caesar,"I loved ""Romeo and Juliet"", ""Hamlet"" and other Shakespeare novels, so I thought that I might try a history Shakespeare had written for my advanced English class. However, I wasn't very impressed. I had thought that Shakespeare's beautiful poetry would add much needed excitement to the book, but, alas, it prevailed. However, if one does not try to interpret what Shakespeare is saying and just reads the words aloud in rhythm, it sounds so eloquent and put together. Thus, I give it three stars."
3,broken book,The contents of the book my 5 year old loves. But the book is completely tore up. The binding is bent and broken.
2,"Thin plot, not very interesting, always expecting more!","The other review subject lines hit it on the head: Thin plot, a bar where everyone knows your name.This movie does not have a very good subject. Is just about a rich man in post WWII era hanging out in a bar and throwing around small amounts of money. Not much of a climax either."
3,Description,"""It can't be true,"" Beth said to herself. ""How can I love a man I met only a week ago?""In a way, however, she had known him much longer--ever since she'd first arrived at Powys months before. Every family portrait she studied, every page of family history she read, contained something of Yorke Powys.But hiss life was disastrously marked by the bye he'd harbored for the ""unknown"" Anne. Suddenly, Beth was angry at Yorke for wasting all he had to offer.She might be a fool, but he was a bigger one!"
3,Nice pendant but the chain is not gold,I bought this item for my wife thinking that the pendant and chain was gold. It turns out that the chain is not real gold.
5,Why isn't one Region 1 DVD???,"WESTWORLD was -- and remains -- a classic. FUTUREWORLD is one of the few sequels that does the original proud. Terrific performances by Peter Fonda (was any actor as underappreciated as this guy?) and a spunky Blythe Danner. Full of twists and turns, and a single finger salute finale. I wish I could add this to my collection."
3,The king in memphis,"Jerry the king Lawler is a great artist. You will see his artwork and it's great. He starts off as a country DJ although he likes rock music and later becomes a professional wrestler to meet women. Creatively, Jerry Lawler has created some of the greatest gimmicks and characters that true wrestling fans will know when reading the book."
3,Not Given Chance to Grow,Show was never given the chance to grow and get better. Lasted less than two seasons and never developed itself.
4,So Helpful!,"This book was an easy read and it was even easier to apply Mr. Greene's philosophies to my routine. Unlike so many of the other books on diet and nutrition, Greene takes into account how difficult it can be to eat healthy and still live in the REAL world.I have taken his advice and changed my diet and (with exercise)already lost 15 lbs. (in a month)The only problem I had was with the receipes in the back. Only one or two were even remotely appetizing to me. Give it a try...maybe you're into those foods."
3,It was good but....,"Overall this is a pretty good album, although I have a bone to pick with some of the albums overtly conservative, and decidedly quite unfunky, political viewpoints.For example on track one Mr.Clinton goes so far as to almost suggest that Richard Nixon was some sort of martyr to the initial cause of kenfunky fried chicken funk.That is quite untrue , in fact nixon was perhaps one of the most pale winged turkeys out there , no sense of funk at all. Other than that there is funk to be found on this album, and let me tell you holmes bisquat your gonna get it."
5,Loneliness never sounded so good!,"Mr.Mckuen's music is what you need if you are the sad romantic-type!I AM<I AM!Beautifully captured tales of woe.I wish his more recent music was available,but hey.Poetic and poignant."
4,Will knock the FDA flat on it's ear!!!,"Fran McCullough has for the past few years been an advocate of low carbohydrate eating and has produced a number of superb low carb cookbooks. This time she takes on fats and has written a splendidly researched, extremely thorough and highly-readable book on the virtues of good fats and the evils of hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated fats.This book is sure to ruffle a lot of feathers because is turns the so called ""Food Pyramid"" into rubble. This book is a top notch overview of the history of fat and how it got such a bum rap.I highly recommend this book to readers who are interested in the science of nutrition. I do wish though that there were more recipes in the book but the information presented in it more than makes up for that!"
3,Not really a cookbook,"I received this book as a gift - thank goodness. It is not really a cookbook - it is more of a fact book. The recipes do not include any nutritional information - something I consider a must for anyone on a low-carb diet. The serious dieter needs to know the amount of carbs, fiber, fat, etc., for a low-carb diet to be effective. I wanted to buy her Low-Carb Cookbook, but I am hesitant to do so after reading this book."
1,Horrible knee support,"These supports run very large and actually fell off my leg when I attempted to put one on. I ordered two. I would not recommend this product to anyone, and ended up throwing them away. Seller represented that they were working with me, but as it turns out, they did not."
3,Not much help,"This is one of those items that you cannot buy online, at least without 1st trying it on in person. The one I bought was too small and would only have been useful for a specific set of circumstances. This may be a case of self-medication that is wrong; the knee is our most fragile joint, given the stresses it is under; to put so much force onto it, such as these bandages, without doctor supervision, may be a mistake."
5,Martin Luther King Book,This book was an excellent resource for my elementary class when studying Martin Luther King Jr. It was also written by his sister which gives kids a first hand account of what he was like. The illustrations in this book are fabulous as well!
5,Arrive at work Relaxed!,The first note of Iz's singing took my breath away. I listen to this tape over and over while commuting. I arrive at my destination relaxed in spite of the traffic.
5,Sandy Bull,"Back in 1964 as a high school sophomore I walked into a little head shop in the West Village just off Washington Square. Incense filled the air and Sandy Bull's album, Inventions, was on the turntable. Those were the best of times. Now nearly a half century later I'm still lovin it. Five stars all the way!!!"
3,Kindle edition has problems,"This is a very informative book, and it is well written. But, the Kindle edition has format problems. The end marks don't link, it is missing chuncks of words on some locations (one page has about 10% of the words are missing) several letters per word are missing so the page reads like having to solve a puzzle. On a different page the text is overwritten by other text. This is not in the part you get as the sample. I don't know how they will let anyone know the issue has been fixed, but I just wanted to apply an FYI."
2,"Traditional music, but too much singing and not enough drum","The songs are in a traditional Egyptian rythmn which makes them easy to dance to and play zills, but I found the emphasis on singing not very appealing. There are few drum solos since most of the tracks are songs, and there is not much variety. As a dancer, I am less interested in this CD than in others that have less emphasis on singing and more emphasis on varied rythms and drums."
3,"Too big for a woman 5'7""","Another reviewer of this product is right. This bag is for a BIG GUY. If you want to carry 2 gallons of water, along with a 17"" screen laptop, this would do the job. But for me, this was not what I was looking for. I'm 5'7"", not petite as a woman. But still, when I carry this, I feel like a 3 year-old kid is hanging down on my back.Another complaint is the design is very simple so that the compartments are not many enough. If you're looking for a day use with many pockets and compartments, you won't be satisfied.However, I must admit that the craftsmanship is superior. Extremely sturdy, well-made, better quality than any other backpacks I've ever owned. If you're a big guy and want to carry a lot at once, go for it."
5,Freaky.,I would recommend you to watch this. It does make you wonder on people that are gone and the construction of buildings.
2,Ho-hum boring snooze fest,"Ho-hum boring snooze fest. Neat building is scheduled for demolition, the story of who lives in said building and it's past. The Demo expert Sam (Mischa Barton) who is brought in to take down the behemoth, becomes stroke fodder for teen boy who lives in the building with his nut job mother (deborah kara unger). The teen boy ends up falling in love with the pretty demo girl and it's all down hill from here. Good acting and a cool setting can not save this slow and tired story, as nothing really happens other then you are the one who feels walled in. I just kept checking the clock to see if time really had come to a complete stand still or maybe I had just slipped into a coma from boredom. Do not waist your time on this one."
3,Expecting More,"When purchasing Ancient Tones I was expecting to hear Ricky move to the next step in bluegrass. I was hoping for a record of all new material, not more cover tunes that we've heard time and time again. With Bluegrass Rules homage was paid to the early bluegrass pickers that shaped the music into what it has become. Now it's time for Ricky to move on. His place in bluegrass history is already intact. With a stellar band like Kentucky Thunder it's time for Ricky to move forward and take bluegrass to the next level. If his intent is to help bluegrass he needs to keep it fresh and provide new material, not dwell too much on the older stuff. Everyone likes to hear a classic once in a while but let's not get stagnant with the ideas that are infused in this great music. Still, Ancient Tones is an album that will round out any good bluegrass collection. But I would not consider it a staple of a good collection."
3,Size runs quite small,"This appears to be a well made boot. It is good looking and light weight too. However, it was strangely small/narrow sized.My left foot is larger and wider than my right. I ordered to fit the left, and in a wide size. When the boots arrived, I found they were not even comfortable on my (smaller) right foot. Not even close. Had to send them back for refund."
1,Fraud too,"The International Library of Photography has misleading contests just to get a hold of non copyrighted pictures. Then, they offer to sell you a book containing your picture at a presale discount rate of 69.95. However, that is apparently what it goes for any way. I wouldn't encourage them by purchasing this book."
1,Weak Effort,"This DVD is pretty bad. The sound is not good and the visual really lacks in all aspects. I think watching the video was the same as the dvd. The only plus is that you get the trailer, but that does not help enough. Kubrick is dead, take his work and make it look as it once did and as great as it could be."
3,I'm not so sure,"I really am not sure what I think of this movie. It's incalculably more subtle than the far more famous Dr Strangelove, but it still is over the edge in some ways. It's portrayal of the military is more than a bit jaded. Dax is the only man shown as a reasonable, unstereotyped man. All the others are various categories of caricature: drunks, errant cowards, sycophantic yes men, 'careerists', connivers and back stabbers.On the flip side the movies cinematography and directing our truly outstanding. It's amazing that Kubrick was only about 28 when he made this movie with more deft directorial strokes than most directors manage when they are twice that age and have done a hundred films. The casting really is another high point on the film.If it weren't so over the top as far as criticizing the military it would get another star, but here it is."
4,if you haven't seen this movie make it a point to.,If you haven't seen this movie you need to. This movie is a classic war/courtroom drama. That if it was not the first it has really defined this type of movie format.
3,Enjoyable Read,"This is a pleasant, feel-good story reminiscent of ""The Help."" The author's familiarity with the language and phrasing of the South adds credibility."
4,"Good read, great story",I love it when a plan comes together - just about sums up this book. It was a good read and they all live happily ever after but you'll love the characters in the process.
2,Instant Excitement then Dissapointment,"Unlike the other posters that were unhappy with the novel, I am actually a mild fan of Sen. Boxer. I appreciate her work fighting for the values I share with her. I'm a weaking for anything to do with the U.S. Senate- when I saw this novel I was so excited! I couldnt wait to read it.But alas-- My excitment dwindled. I'm not a literary critic, but I know what I enjoy in a book. I agree whole-heartedly Sen. Boxer is a hobby writer.The book started off well I thought, I was hooked in the story line. I felt the transition from present to the characters past was done poorly and was premature. While I'm reading about the characters in the past all I'm thinking about is the present plot line- and how poorly the past is written. I'm on page 220- hope it gets better."
1,It's just Vanity Press,"In ""A Time To Run"", Barbara Boxer is obviously grinding a political ax in novella form. Boxer's hackneyed, xenophobic depiction of the characters will make liberals squeal with pleasure and conservatives groan.Considering the mediocre writing talent of Boxer and/or her ghost writer, it's doubtful this book would have been published without Boxer's ""name""."
4,"I remember..We were flying low, and hit something in the air....","Bloodrock were one of the beginning bands into the goth-death rock genre that sprouted ten years after their demise. They were just ahead of their time.I used to own this album on vinyl. I liked every song on it. Yet the song that drove me to purchase this album so long ago was the classic D.O.A! It is gory, brutally honest and graphic in it's depiction of two victims of an airplane crash dying on their way to the hospital! This song even had ambulance sirens blaring off after every gory stanza. And at the end the siren loses it's pitch and fades out as if the drivers know their passengers are dead and the siren is no longer needed!I look forward to Amazon.com offering that song in mp3 format, as I will purchase it!"
3,Dazed and Confused; part 4,"These guys ROCK HARD. This band is just CHEEZY enough to be FANTASTIC. D.O.A. is just amazing; what a song ! The rest of the record isn't remotely that brilliant but musically it's still one mule-kicking song after another, sometimes even mixing in gospel elements with a few bars of Bolero (Sable and Pearl), & it's only the awful lyrics that ruin everything (""Woman, Please Believe Me, I Wouldn't Cheat on You.""; yeah, right! The Rock star as saint.)."
4,Not As Bad As Alot Complain It To Be,"While most people agree that Fight For The Rock is NOT Savatage's most well recieved album and is only for die-hard fans, I myself am not a die-hard fan but do like their music as well as this album. Fight For The Rock DOES have some great moments with song's such as Fight For The Rock, their version of the Badfinger Classic Day After Day, as well as Free's Wishing Well, Hyde and She's Only Rock 'N Roll. I remember buying this on Cassette (way way) back in 1986 at the ripe 'ol age of 19 (now 39). Ahhh those were the day's."
1,FIGHT FOR THE GLAM AND COMMERCIAL SUCCESS,"THis is the first (and only, thanks !!) time SAVATAGE tried hard to go mainstream, producing an awful glam album full of boring music and without any merits. It's a shame to the band discography, but they proved to be better than this and changed into one of the best American metal bands."
1,Low power,"It works but the output power isn't high enough to really useful especially if you live in an area where there are lots of radio stations.If you move more than 10-15 ft away from the FM receiver, you will start to get static along with the signal. Alternate solutions to consider are the 900Mhz devices that include a transmitter and receiver. But of course those devices generally cost more."
4,Depends Where You Live,"The concept here is phenomenal. I have an Ipod, but since my car has only a CD player, and no tape deck, those cassette adapters were never any help. When I heard about the iRock, I bought it asap.I live in Brooklyn NY, where the iRock gets a lot of interference. I drive often to Manhatten, where the interference is even worse. But then again, I also drive a lot out to New Jersey, where it works perfect. So my advice is this - If you have a cassette player, your much better off buying the cassette adapters. If not, I still reccomend this product (i havent returned mine) but just be warned that you may exerience interference in some areas. Another side point - uses up batteries VERY fast."
2,Not good in St. Louis,"Since all the stations this thing works on are covered here, this is really a useless device unless I'm travelling. Another buyer from St. Louis said that could be solved by opening up the device and doing some sodering and attaching cable and electrical tape to your antenae, but I have no idea how to soder anything..."
2,Great... if you live in Saturn.,"In this world, many people (including myself) live in cities. Big ones. The like where there's a radio station on 88.1, 88.5 and 88.7. I researched if the mighty 300W iRock was worth it and finally bought it for nineteen bucks at a Radio Shack. Guess what? It doesn't work! First I thought it was the battery, but oh no... it was the iRock. I couldn't come to terms with the idea that an item recomended by Apple for it's iPod would be such a cheap contraption.I shall rate this... mmmhhh... thing... two stars, because if you're far enough from a city (like driving around Hawaii's Big Island) or have a really expensive digital tuner it does work.For us citizens of the great cities, there should be a better alternative"
3,A fair solution for wireless audio,"The iRock works pretty well in transmitting audio from a mobile device (like a mp3 player or portable CD player) to a ""dead"" radio station which any nearby FM radio will pick up. The flaws of this device, however, stem from the fact that when the batteries are not very fresh, the transmitted audio becomes very poor. In addition, it's really easy to accidentally turn on the iRock. Since the on/off button is located on the front of the device, it often turns itself on when being transported. A switch of some sort would have been a much better design."
1,no good in Boston,"Maybe this thing works in parts of the country with only a few radio stations. Around Boston you're always competing with a stronger signal.There's really no point in buying this product. I tried several similar ones, and ended up putting my tape deck back into the car so I could use a tape converter input instead. That actually worked."
4,Very handy and sleek,I liked this device at first sight. A very nice design which goes very well with my Rio MP3 player. The reception is cranky at times and I think it could be better. But overall I am satisfied with this unit.
3,Bad in crowded areas,"The FM band in Southern California is crowded, so this product cannot work well ... there are stations already on the four selectable frequencies.In less crowded areas (meaning number of stations, not people), it works great. Just make sure you don't already have stations on the 88.1, 88.3, 88.5 or 88.7 FM frequencies."
2,Good Idea Poorly Executed,"The iRock might work well in perfect circumstances, but in the real world, it's design really limits its usefulness...first, you need a place in your car for the Irock to sit. Its cable is a few inches long, so on our iPod, it hangs down the side of our center 'hump' and is hard to reach and adjust...there doesn't seem to be a good place to put it. Second, our antenna is on the back of our car, not the front, so there's a long distance between our iPod/iRock and antenna. Lots of static breaks through. On one four hour trip, I had to constantly readjust the station on which the iRock was transmitting because, as we travelled, adjacent stations that would come and go would overwhelm it. Finally, and most problematic, is that the button has no protection or 'smarts'. If you carry it in a bag or pocket, the button WILL get pushed accidentally and you WILL drain your battery. Very, very annoying."
5,This thing rocks!,"I've had the irock! for a week, and it works great. Even though I live only 10 miles out of Boston, I had no problem finding two empty frequencies that the irock! could use. The sound quality is as good as any radio station on the dial, and the signal strength meter on my home stereo reads 4 out of 5. I think I must have a different model than others have described - mine has no external antenna. The range is outstanding. Playing songs on my laptop, I was able to walk anywhere in my house and maintain good, stereo sound. It's especially convenient in our old car, which has no cassette player. The sound quality was perfect, and did not drift with antenna placement. I am very pleased with this device."
2,Reception Limited,"The iRock 300W Wireless Music Adaptor offers four frequencies, but they are too close together for good reception if there is a strong local broadcast station. Interference from the local station kills the reception. Also, it goes through batteries in about 5 - 6 hours and strong batteries are needed even when there are no interfering local stations."
2,poor reception,poor transmission quality and difficult to swap around to different channels while trying to drive at the same time.
1,Amazed anyone enjoyed this!,"This book has no business calling itself a psychological thriller. There was nothing thrilling about it. It was boring, and seemed like it was written by an eighth-grader. The number of typos was astounding. This was definitely a waste of time and money."
4,Lee's review,"Lee's wooden corn cutter was purchased as a gift for someone else, I was told that it saves time and works very well"
3,USEFULL BUT NOT ESSENTIAL,"This is an interesting little book but I didnt find that it provided the answers to some of the technical questions that I had. Although the author had owned a Com-Pac 16 Trailer Sailer and he used this to illustrate much of the text I still didnt learn anything that common sense would not otherwise have provided.If you have the money, then by all means buy it, but I think there must be some more technically usefull books out there.For example, I wanted to know how to rig the genoa on my Com-Pac 16- it wasnt their in sufficient detail to solve my problem. In the end I got the information from the on-line forum.I also wanted to know how the drop keel worked: again it wasnt their in any detail.Perhaps I am being a little too hard: it was quite an interesting read for a trailer sailing enthusiast."
3,Littlest Pet Shop Just OK,"My daughter played with her neighbor's Littlest Pet Shop a lot, so her sister bought it for her for Christmas. However, the product has been a little disappointing - my daughter says the buttons don't always respond to pressure and acts like the battery is low, even though it's brand-new. She also received a Tamagotchi pet the month before for her birthday and is still playing with it everyday and going to Tama World on the Internet; it seems to be the better choice."
1,Girls ONLY,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. Unfortunately, it is clearly for girls only. The description did not indicate this and, if it did, it was not clear enough for this working Mom to notice. He actually got this from Santa and now thinks that Santa's elves screwed up and gave him a girl's thing by mistake and a girl has his boy present."
3,Playing the Fool,"While the recording is great, it is not the type of music I will listen to all of the time."
3,You fink! You stink!,"This collection features all three albums by Mr. Gasser & the Weirdos. ""Mr. Gasser"" was famed hot rod cartoonist Ed ""Big Daddy"" Roth. I'm not sure how much involvement ""Big Daddy"" actually had on these albums, other than drawing the covers. He is supposedly the singer here, but I have some doubts about that. As for the music, it consists of hot rod and surf songs. The songs are all played for laughs, and are not meant to be taken seriously. This is by no means ""important"" music, but if you are a fan of hot rod music, you will probably dig it."
4,VINTAGE THEATRE TELEVISION,"Startling and ambitious vintage network TV production from 1966 is a heart-breaking and unrelentlessly tragic drama with Lee J. Cobb in such a supoerb performance, you want to reach out and console the troubled sympathetic character. So downbeat as to be almost dismal, the play succeeds in it's grip on the realities of grief and doom and the undying hope of a better tomorrow. The rest of the cast is equally superb and I loved the fake realism of the CBS cameras taping a obviously theatrical set."
2,Vectorman Sega Tunes,"This is NOT the orginal game score for Vectorman. If you want the original, this will not satisfy. It is an interesting remix."
1,The worse movie I have seen in a decade!,"I went in looking for a nice light comedy. From the previews it looked like it was a remake of Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. I was not expecting a great movie, just an entertaining one. Instead I get one of the worst films I have seen in almost a decade. This is the first movie I have walked out on since Ishtar and is a lot worse because at least Ishtar did not go into the base humor that this movie goes for. And this is saying a lot because I fealt Ishtar was one of the worse movies I have ever seen!."
1,WOW!,Wow. I don't think they're enough adjectives in the English language to describe how wretchedly awful this picture is. Why was this movie made? I wasted an hour and a half of my life on this tripe.
5,WARNING: Extremely Funny,Rat Race is the best movie I have seen in a long time. I wish more movies could be like that.-Brian
4,"Pretty good remake of ""It`s a Mad, Mad World""","This movie is a decent updated remake of ""It`s a Mad, Mad World"".Not as good as the original, but then few remakes ever come close to matching the original. Given that, it`s still a pretty goodcomedy. Even if it does lack the pure raw starpower of the original, most of the actors are in this one are pretty good and turnin solid performances.The plot of a good fast paced comedy is always fairly simple and this one is no exception. It`s a race. There is $2 million dollarswaiting to be claimed by the winner. The only rule is get there first any way you can."
4,Rat Race,"I dragged my wife and teenage daughter to this flick without telling them anything about it. They walked in not knowing what to expect and they both loved the movie. It is a fast-paced, funny movie with lots of surprises. There is one outrageous scene after another. As soon as you finish one, you are whisked off to another. The name for the movie is unfortunate. Who wants to see a movie about a rat race. Isn't that what we do all day? Besides, there was another movie called The Rat Race years ago. The ads on TV generally aren't very good either, but the movie is a great Summer escape and a good hoot."
4,very funny movie,"this movie hilarious the first time you see it. however, the second and third times you watch the movie, a lot of the jokes aren't as funny anymore. also, ending wasn't great. all-in-all, a good movie."
5,jenns race to stop laughing,Hi my name is jenn and i saw this movie in theaters and i could not stop laughing.i have only seen it once but it is now my favorite movie ever.it has one naked part but only for a couple of seconds.i recamend this movie for ages 10 and up if you are mature even though its rated pg13.so please just see it and remember see it in a place where theres room to fall over laghing histaricly!!!!!!!
4,.............,"I watched this movie around when it was just released on DVD and video, and until I saw Rat Race at my local BJ's, I had completely forgotten this movie had existed.It's not one of those movies that you 'have to have', persay, but it's worthy of buying. I bought it, but mainly just because it was like 8.88 or something and for some apparent reason I just was inclined to buy it. But like I said, until then, I had forgotten it had existed.WARNING!!!!!!!Side effects that may take place after or during the course of this movie may include drowsiness. Do not attempt to watch if you are expecting a 'side-splitting laughter' type of comedy.It's one of those movies where you may lose your audience. That's a good way to put it in a nutshell. But the middle to the end of the movie is where all of the 'good' parts take place in.In addition to this movie, I would also recommend The Italian Job, which I would give 5+ stars. That movie was just awesome!"
1,Uninspired.,"There were a few laughs, but in general this movie could be relegated to sophomoric humour. I suppose this could have been discerned from the previews alone, but the movie definitely makes good on being tiresome. By the end, you don't care who the people are, what they're doing...or if anyone wins."
3,ok,funny and lots of action going on with all the many characters involved. Not bad at all. Give it a try
1,Sickening,This is a a discusting vulgar movie. I cannot beleive a talented actor like John Cleese would lower himself to such a low life role. Pure trash!! A sad rip off of Mad Mad Mad world. The fact that so many Americans like it shows what low lifes Americans are.
3,Funny!,"This movie was funnier than I had expected. I thought that all of the ""good"" parts would be given away in the trailers, but only a few of them were. This movie was fun and high energy with a great cast. John Cleese and Whoopie Goldberg were naturally wonderful and there is a hilarious cameo by Kathy Bates!"
5,Best Comedy of the Summer,I was lucky enough to catch a sneek Saturday night. Totally hilarious!! I could not stop laughing during some of the scenes. I can't recommend this comedy enough if you are in the mood for laughing.
3,"Another take of It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World (1963)","Terrible name for a film. Yet another take on the filmIt's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World(1963). Just a different story and different wacky actors. You know the original story. A few lucky people travel hundreds of miles just to get to a fortune. Who ever reaches the money first...well you know. Also done as SCAVENGER HUNT (1979) andMillion Dollar Mystery(1987). Best part of film is Jon Lovitz and cameo appearances of real-life attorney Gloria Allred. I wonder if this is where they got the idea for the Amazing Race tv series? In Special Features, ""Jerry & Andy Call The Actors"", when they call impromptu Jon Lovitz. It is so funny. Paul Rodriguez is a delight!"
5,"An unusual, fascinating story","A young girl is discovered swimming in the waters between Florida and Cuba, and when researchers bring her in, they learn that she has been living with dolphins, basically raised by them and taught to communicate and survive in their world. In the laboratory, where they attempt to teach her human speech and behavior, this girl they've named Mila makes slow progress, and eventually she must choose between living in their world and living in the one she has known for most of her life. This unusual, fascinating story is made even more so by the fact that it is told by Mila, and like Flowers for Algernon, we see her speech and behavior slowly improve as the story is told, and then decline as she realizes that she would rather live among the dolphins than with humans. An intriguing book that will appeal to anyone interested in psychology, especially the psychology of language acquisition and the stories of historical figures such as the Wild Boy of Averon and Genie."
3,A speechless dolphin,I am writing this because I am doing it for a reading assignment. I rated it 2 stars because it was catchy but the point of the story was given away in the middle of the story.I would recommend this book to kids from the ages of 9-12 because it is easy at the beginning and it gets harder towards the middle.
3,"Good, but Easy","This book had an excellent plot and I found it easy. altogether a good read. The plot tied longing for the sea, imprisonment, and love together for a good book."
5,Read this book!,"We give this book 5 stars because it shows how all people are different. It shows us that people can be raised differently than others. Mila was a very quiet girl, although she was very smart. Her character is very likeable. She was a fast learner and was always persistent. The ending will surprise you! This book rocks!"
1,A Fairly Pointless Book,"I read this book for a bookd report, and I'm sorry to say that I wasted my time on it. The book explores the improbability of a girl living with a family of dolphins into her early teens. I give Ms. Hesse a one for her effort, but she could have done a lot better, and I'm suprised they even published the book."
2,The Music of Dolphins,"In my opinion, this is a great book for someone who loves dolphins. Other then that, it's not a very good book. One of the only things I really liked about this book was the part when Mila became humanized, and had to adapt to the human ways after living as a dolphin for about ten years. That was pretty interesting."
2,a no no,Have no idea what it talk about .I was seeking for some handjob sence .that's all but it was make me boring
3,Hung?,"Of teen twins far distant from a physical attractiveness, a sporty 40+ dad supports living by hustling after coaching a rugby team daily, helped by two female pimps cheating him and profiting on his manhood without his prior knowledge with dare consequences.Also male skills echoCalifornication's tunes somehow, an emphasis prevails on morals and a social impact these business-in-demand providers experience."
5,Great! Great! Great!,"Stiff Little Fingers is one of my favorite bands, and this CD puts together some of their very best stuff. If you like punk rock, even a little bit, I guarantee that you'll like this album. God! How does he sing like that?"
4,missing some songs,"Where are ""White Noise"" and ""Here We Are Nowhere""??..you cannot complete a SLF comp without those two tracks...grrrrr record people make me angry..anyway SLF is great and so is this collection with the exception they didn't include TWO OF MY FAVORITE SONGS BY SLF EVER!!!!...GRRR..buy it anyway..pfft record executives"
5,Lincoln Biography in One Volume,This book is fifty seven (57) years old but it is still living and breathing today. The writing is concise and to the point. The writer masterfully follows the thread of Lincoln's life. He skillfully crafts a picture of Lincoln's character in the context of the difficulties he had to deal with and overcome.
4,Very Well Done...,"...this ""Gunfighters"" DVD, unlike others, is very well done, and factually correct. Excellent production qualities. This three disc package is definitely worth the money."
2,tiny book,My kids loved it. I hated it way to small to read. perfect fit for children's small hands.
1,"IT's the Great Pumpkin,Charlie Brown",It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown by Charles M. SchulzPublished by Little SimonCharlie Brown and his friends were going trick or treating and Linus and Sally were not going with her friends because she wanted to see the Great Pumpkin. Charlie Brown and Snoopy are similar to me because i like to go off and do things by my self like they seem to do. Lucy is always in her own snobby worldThis book is not a page turner but it does skip back and fourth through the scenes. I always wanted to keep reading. Yes this book is funny and the best chartered is Snoopy because he was driving the Red Baron and he is winning the war. I also liked it when they were at the party and they were bobbing for apples. I really liked this book because it is Charlie Brown and he is the bomb.[cool] I really recommend this book because it is really funny and you should read it.
5,Nice Read,Great book about the way it used to be in baseball when it was still just a game. A must read.
2,DISAPPOINTED!.,"I WAS VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED AS THEY SEND ME ''SAND'' UGLY, COLOR, WHEN I HAD ORDERED WHICH DI ''NOT'' MATCH WITH MY BOAT. UNFORTUNATELY, I HAD TO GO IN A LONG SAILING TRIP THE NEXT DAY AND HAD NO TIME TO RETURN THEM... BUT TRULY, I WILL HAVE TO GIVE THEM AWAY, BECAUSE I HAD TO ''RUN'' AND GET NEW ONES ''BLUE'' OR ''WHITE''(COLOR THAT I HAD ORDERED FROM YOU) SO SORRY TO TELL YOU ALL THESE, BUT BETTER TO BE HONEST IN LIFE!!!! SINCERELY, FERNANDO"
1,I never did understand this book.,"This is the most confusing book I have ever tried to read. It started out good then it jumped to other things and I was lost. I never could understand if the characters were living or dead, old or young, or male or female. And the oven???? This book was too much for me, there are too many good books to waste my time with one I don't understand."
1,A cure for insomnia!,"Once I pick up a book, I feel I have to plow through the whole thing, but with this one I only made it halfway through. I stopped pushing myself to finish this novel because there are too many other good books out there waiting to be read! This was a waste of my time and I will never read a book based on Oprah's recommendation again if this is the kind of literature that is on the list! It was extremely slow-moving and the characters were dark and mysterious to a point of confusion for this reader. Friends have mentioned that they thought they would read this book based on the fact that it was a prize winner and I have flat out told them not to bother."
2,a two day project,"I read this for a book club. I went away for a weekend and read it in 24 hours. Paradise is about isolation. Are you interested in isolation? I was. I have never read anything else by Morrison, but I may after this."
1,God help me!,I promised someone I love I would read this book. It was horribly written. Only after doing some independent research and talking again and again with said loved one did I get ANYTHING out of this book. I won't be reading any of Morrison's other books.This is why many people criticize academics--sometimes they get too big for their britches.
4,Haunting and compelling,"I wish I weren't so uncomfortable with ambiguity, as there is much of it in this book. I love Morrison's writing, though it humbles me, too. It was a very challenging book to read in the snippets I get riding the train to/from work. I feel like I need to (and want to) flip back to the beginning right away and read it all over again. Nevertheless, like her other books (of which Song of Solomon is one of my all-time favorites), her prose is beautiful and haunting. It's a compelling exploration of race, gender and belonging."
1,One of the only books I never finished,after struggling through 90 pages of this book I finally gave up . I had no desire to try and figure out what it was about. Usually after a lesser number of pages of any book I can get attached to it but this one was impossible. One of the worst books I have ever read.
1,Difficult Read even to college educated individuals.,"Got lost many times and had to back track in order to get on base again. Enjoyed the reading when Tony took time to allow conversations and actions by her characters, but that wasn't very often. Do not recommend this book to even serious readers."
1,"Disjointed,philosophical & thought provoking in spots",The overall theme and many of the issues addressed are very thought provoking and well worth being put in print. The problem is the story it self does not flow. At times it is not clear who is the subject of the chapter and where you are in time and place. I would not recommend.
2,???,"I am a fairly sophisticated reader. I read a book a week, and was an English major and have read many of the great classics. But for the life of me I don't have a clue as to what Ms. Morrison is trying to say here. There is no doubt that she is a talented and skilled writer. Her descriptions and some scenes are striking. However, she is all over the map here. There are so many unnecessary characters in this book that the average reader will be completely lost. Who is who and how are they related to one another? After awhile, a reader will just give up. I have read two other of the author's books, but after this one I will not attempt any future ones. I think Toni Morrison is one of our most overrated American authors and has been given literary prizes simply because no one knows what the heck she is saying."
1,Not Paradise but Purgatory!,My irritation overflows at Oprah for promoting a book with such inthusiasm that is so painful to slog through. Had it been a movie I would have walked out. Because I had faith in her selection powers I finished the book. I couldn't regret it more.
1,a confusing deliberately contrived book,"The reviewers of this book have not been honest .There is nothing to praise.A struggling prose,contrived ideas and perhaps a feeling that as the Nobel Prize winner the writer had to come up with something different.Thoroughly confusing and poorly written.Very weak characters not worth writing about.Losers like Mavis.Perhaps they should have given two Nobels to Arundhaty Roy for her God Of Small Things."
2,Very Disappointing,"The plot is confussing and weakly held together by the detailed personal stories. I found little that was morally redeeming or outstanding in this book. Having grown-up in Oklahoma, I found the book unauthentic. I cannot recommend this book."
2,This was not a pleasurable reading experience.,I had anticipated that this would be a tough read. Toni has an extraordinary gift of the written word but this novel was a disappointment. The characters were too complex. I could not determine where the story was headed. I tried hard not to put it down before the end but frustration won out. Maybe I will try to read it again later.
3,"I found '' Paradise'', hard to follow after only about half","of the book because I found it hard to follow. But, after reading the above reviews, I am willing to give it another try.I also found ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" by John Berendt, hard to follow but I re-read that and found that an excellent book. So, maybe there's hope for ""Paradise""."
3,Flashes of brilliance but chaotic organization,"Toni Morrison is generally worth reading for her lush prose but in this particular book, the organization leaves the reader confused as to what happened to whom and when. I kept looking for the reason behind the obscure structure of the book. There are some powerful moments, especially toward the end, when describing the violence that men have felt towards unfettered women, but overall I was left disatisfied. This could have been a much more powerful book if the reader hadn't had to struggle so hard to figure out the histories of the characters."
2,Rather difficult read..,"After reading all the good reviews and the fact that this book was on some cool people's list mania lists - I really wanted to read it and to like it. But after having bought it, I found it rather difficult to follow and understand.The charachters keep coming in and it's hard to keep track of who's who. You know they are all going to come together in the convent somehow but it's still hard to follow and make a connection. I consider myself to be an avid reader and reasonably intellectual but unfortunately I could not bring myself to finish this book. Maybe in a few years time I'll come back to it and understand it better!"
2,very dissapointing,"I was sorely dissapointed with Paradise.The first page was great, but went down hill from there.I patiently waited for it to get better and expected the last chapters to make it all worthwhile,this novel was my first read of Toni Morrison, will read her again to see if this was just one of her great flops."
1,Why bother?,I made it through half of this book and said forget it. I had to force myself to get that far. Toni Morrison can't seem to say what needs to be said for the reader to halfway comprehend what is going on in Ruby or at the convent. This makes for a selfish author who has let success go to her head.
1,"Horrible, Slow - Moving, and Difficult To Follow","This novel moves rediculously slow, with benign details and decoy storylines. I found it very difficult to folow which for me is a first. I would give it no stars if that was possible, but I will give it one star for its title that lures you in and makes you read this very boring book."
2,To the lady on the Train: It Wasn't Worth It!,"I was sitting on the train home from work, determined to ""get through"" the last 40 pages of my new book when the woman sitting next to me glanced over and asked if I was enjoying the book. I paused for a moment, turned to her and said, ""I don't know!"". She then explained that she got through the first 2 chapters of ""Paradise"" and could not go on. Being someone that feels I would be insulting a book (books are people too!)if I did not finish, I thought everything would work out in the end. It didn't. People had told me this was a brilliant book - I almost felt stupid not feeling the euphoria at the end. That was ""almost""... yeah, it was a hard read - big deal! But gosh, to actually recommend people to read it AGAIN?!?! If I was that disappointed after struggling through the first read - lord knows what would happen if I read it again! I'm just relieved it's over!"
3,the men of the Ruby attack to woman of the Convent,I think that is so crazy with the men to attack to woman in the Convent as they don't allow their wife to let them out alone as their wife often go to find woman in the Convent. they feel that the reasons with the wife left is woman taught them so man don't like them so much and attack to them and raped or killed them.
3,High gain monster,"This is a very good, very high gain distortion. Perfect for extreme metal. Heavy, solid casing, Sound astounding!It's sound tends towards the high end and goes very ""Treble-ly"" and ""Screechy"" at higher settings, due to the Amazing amount of gain it produces...But it's great for an extreme metal tone, that being said I personally prefer the digitech Grunge distortion pedal...Nothing against this one, the grunge just fills my tonal needs a little better at the moment..."
4,"Nice Design, Seems Durable Enough","The mailbox was easy to assemble, but was a little tricky to install because we re-used our old 4x4 post and it was a very tight fit. The quality control could have been a bit better: The Step2 emblem fell off, which would have been okay except it covered a 3/4 inch hole from the blow molding process. I'll need to cover it before spring to keep the wasps out. The second issue was the tight fit on the curb side mail door. I tried switching doors but the imperfection was in the box rather than the door. I also agree with other reviewers about the exposed lag bolts. It would have been nice to cover them up with something. I also wish the numbers provided with the mailbox were reflective.Overall the final result is pleasing and sturdy. The price was reasoable and Amazon made it easy. Other than the issues above I would recommend this mailbox."
2,Disappointed in Depth and Direction of this Book,"I was disappointed in the ""new-age"", self-indulgent perspective this book presented. I was looking for a practical, healing, common-sense approach to building self-esteem, particularly from the feminine perspective. The approach of promoting that we are each the center of the universe and that being self-centered and self-indulgent is the answer to developing our self-esteem does not set well with me."
3,Great Entertainment But...,"Great entertainment, but there is something about the film that has always bothered me, although most reviewers would accuse me of nit-picking (and probably they are right). Liza Minnelli is at her musical peak - and that is the problem. Sally Bowles is a third-rate talent performing in a third-rate club. This is something that the Broadway versions have always understood, in that they have always casted Sally with an actress who could sing rather than a singer who could act (especially the most recent version with Natasha Richardson). Minnelli's Sally is way too talented - she would have been ""discovered"" a long time ago and whisked away from the Kit Kat Club. That being said, however, sit back and enjoy Bob Fosse's dazzling direction, Joel Grey's chilling, award-winning MC, and Minnelli belting out her songs in the inimitable Minnelli style."
2,"Should have a title other than ""Cabaret""...","Cabaret, the on-stage musical, is one of the most enthralling and moving musicals to be ever found on Broadway. It's message and theme are both important and beautiful. The only problem is that when they attempted to adapt it to the screen, the took a beautiful show, and ripped it apart. The plot, characters, and a few songs (Mein Herr, Money) are completely distorted and absolutely different than the original show. This movie should have had a different title other than ""Cabaret"" because this is not the same as the magnificent show. I gave it two stars only because the movie itself is not all terrible. This movie and the show should be viewed as two completely different entities, they truly have nothing in common."
3,Still shines bright,"Despite the mediocrity of picture and sound of this DVD edition, Cabaret still shines bright after forty years, both as musical entertainment and social commentary. It depicts as accurately as any other document the contradictions and conflicts of German (and European) society during the rise of Nazism, the hedonistic atmosphere and decadence of the early thirties, an attitude of life that helped mask the menace of Hitler that was about to engulf Europe and the world. Thoroughly entertaining, enjoyable, and frightening."
5,Excellent,"This is a great story based in Berlin at the rise of the Nazis to power. it has some wonderful songs, some of which will be familiar to many. it also has some wonderful acting, especially by Joel Grey as the MC of the KitKatKlub. While the Supporting Actor category that year was deep with wonderful performances by the trio from The Godfather, i do think Mr. Grey deserved it for his role as the MC. just wonderful."
1,Beware False DVD Packaging,"While this is probably not a bone of contention with most viewers, I think it's worth noting for those that do pay attention to these things, especially if you base your purchases on them, as I did in this case. The packaging on this newer DVD edition of ""Cabaret"" states that it is an anamorphic transfer (i.e. ""Enhanced for Widescreen TVs""). It is NOT. This is the SAME disc as before, with new a label on it.They merely changed the packaging, I guess, so that they could mention ""Chicago"" in the description on the back cover and tie it into the heat for that film. Shame on you, Warner Bros. We all work hard for our money and deserve better than to believe we're buying a new anamorphic transfer, when you are really marketing the exact same discs as before."
5,I'm going like Elsie!!!,This movie shows Berlin at it's finest/Darkest hour. Even with a war going on people still managed to have a great time and forget about the dark cloud above their heads. Liza as Sally Bowles was pure genius. Whenever you have self doubt watch this movie and u will have a whole new look on how u live ur life....
4,Don't pass on this,"I almost passed over this DVD because a couple of Amazon reviewers forcefully complained about the presentation. I'm glad I bought it. The widescreen was just as I expected, and picture and sound quality were fine. Anyone who's seen the movie knows how good it is. If you haven't seen it, you're in for a treat; and this DVD serves it well. (A five-star review is for the absolutely superlative.)"
5,Classic and wonderful performance from Liza,"Loved this musical, one of my favorites since Grease. Liza was wonderful, as usual. Should be in every musical lovers library."
2,"Overrated, Unfocused and Dull","If there ever was a film most undeserving of its' iconic status, ""Cabaret"" is it. It is overrated, dull, tedious with zero chemistry between stars Liza Minnelli and Michael York. The ""plot"" itself is very weak and uninteresting. Take my advice--skip this and watch Liza's 1991 misfire ""Steppin' Out"" instead. It's ten times more fun and entertaining than this mess."
2,Sad Tamagotchi Knock Off,"While the Littlest Pet Shop toys are cute, this electronic version is just a knock off of the Tamagotchi."
3,great music - but...,I had this years ago as an LP. Recently got the CD - the music is still gorgeous but the recording (on CD) sounds like it was recorded in a tunnel (which is why I'm rating it as 3 stars instead of 5)
1,what a waste of time,"This movie was C R A P!! All filler and 10 minutes of ""something"". I give it NO stars if I could!"
1,"High School Goth Tween Film,Not a Vampire worthy anything!!!",Okay so I watched the series of movies to figure what the hype was all about. My answer is..... Really? Your joking right? There are far better Vamipre themed Books/Movies With romance than this horrid dis-respect to Vampire and Lycan Culture.Do yourself a favor watch a good Vampire or even Goth themed romance movie.
5,AMAZING!!!!!!!,"I saw Twilight Saga Eclipse this past weekend and I wasn't surprised at how fabulous it was. Each character was developed a little more to where you can start to truly see the characters grow. I am Team Edward, but after watching Eclipse I don't know who's side I am rooting for now. Jacob was awesome, you can truly see his devotion to Bella and how much he would give up for her. I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THE DVD COMES OUT!!!!!!!"
1,where's the bonus features??,"I love this movie and the whole saga, but first, I pre order it and I never got it, second, my friend did get it but it's missing the bonus features! WTH! the 6 part of the making of and the deleted scenes are missing. This is a crappy movie version. DON'T BUY IT AND IF YOU DO BUY IT AT TARGET OR WALMART!"
3,"forget the chick and run off, together","i agree with thomas m. de feo, there is just NO chemistry between stewart and pattinson: edward and jacob should run off and get married in toronto and create a totally NEW tribe (family) of two-spirit vamp-wolves; now, that would be a major, chemical reaction. call the series, the 'two-spirit saga' and really torch the screen with some immortal vampire-werewolf action."
3,;0),Good movie but all the talking that really wasn't needed could have been taken away. This isn't a bad series it is addictive but the thing is it's suppose to be a movie with vampires and wolves but the vampires where are their fangs they just gave the vampire different eye color and made them pale and call it a day even when they are angry I saw no fangs. Other than that nice movie love the action towards the end.
5,Twilight Cougar,"Unlike a lot of the reviews I have read on the Twilight series I have to say that I loved Eclipse! As an older individual I refused to read the series, but finally my friend talked me into buying the first book (Twilight). From the first book until the fourth I was definitely hooked. I have read every book and have watched the first two DVD's at least four times. Each time I read the books or watch the DVD's I see something new. I love the series, I just wish she would write the last book from Edward's perspective?"
4,LOVE THIS,"VERY WELL WRAPPED, I LOVE THE TWILIGHT SERIES. PLAYED WELL, CAME QUICKLY, ONE OF THE DVD THAT I NEEDED TO COMPLETE MY COLLECTION, THANKS JENN"
4,2 dvds would have been nice,"The movie is fantastic and by far my favorite in the series with a job well done with staying as faithful as possible to the book. Regarding the blu-ray plus dvd release, I would have prefered two separate discs-one blu-ray and one-standard rather than a double-sided ""two discs in one"" option. I may be being overly picky, but it is difficult to keep fingerprints off of the dvd when popping it back into place in the case."
5,Eclipse,Love the book and love the movie. This video is the closest yet to the book from the series.
2,Oh God...,"Many classic films have had sequels that were more successful than the original: Godfather II, Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Lord of the Rings Return of the King. However, the makers of Twilight: Eclipse decided to do away with such comparisons and made the exact same film a third time. Yippee. 3 down, 2 more 'films' left. Keep strong everybody."
3,Just okay; not all that interesting,"This time, Bella's pals, dad, and Esme get very little screen time, while the focus shifts more to the conflict between Edward and Jacob over Bella and her future. There is also a group of newborn vampires as well as some older ones, wolves vs. vamps, and plenty of misery and angst to go around among the three leads. Ho hum. Whatever.This is the weakest of the books and the weakest of the movies as well.There is some great scenery, as well as some decent makeup and music, though I still think they could have done a much better job on the wolves."
3,Be aware!,"Be aware, this version only includes the movie itself, no special features. I purchased this version because I don't need a BluRay and a DVD of the same movie (in the dual disc version), but I didn't realize that little detail. It's not made very clear on the product page. I'm sure you can find a higher priced version somewhere that includes special features if you look."
2,Sub-par acting,still waiting for them to get more acting experience. hoping it improves by the time the last one is premiered.
1,It came in the French Version!!!!,No where in the description did it say it was the French version!!!!! Very disappointed. What am I supposed to with this?
2,not subtitled in spanish,"i bought this for my wife, but she like to see the movies in Spanish. it says that it is subtitled but its not. all the other twilight movies i have bought her are spoken in Spanish. so i gotta get her another one now to make up for this.im sure the quality is good just never watched it"
2,It didnt do justice for the book,The book was so much better. And for a movie that made so much money you would think that it would have better animations.
1,wife,I dont know what to say. I really think the movie is bad. everything about it is bad. wow sorry I know my wife is all dreamy eyes over it but this nothing more then a teenage vampire drama and that is all. shiny vampire.... wow do not buy this. read a book or watch paint dry it be better then this
2,Still a very slow moving film,I was smart to rent this in stead of buying. I keep hearing about how each movie is getting better than the next. Not in my experience. I'm sticking to reading the books on this series as the movies are a great waste of time. This one didn't hold my attention at all. I just rented it because I couldn't find anything else on tv to watch. Needless to say that didn't help as I didn't even finish watching this one due to how boring it was.I highly recommend people rent these Twilight movies before buying (unless you can buy them for the price of a rental fee)
5,Best of the Series.,I went to see Eclipse in the movies and just couldnt wait until it came out on dvd. This is defently my favorite Movie of the series!! A must have for any Twilight fan.
3,Twilight so far...,I bought this for my teenager who loved these books. She has lost alot of interest along the way if that says anything.
5,Good Movie,"Bluray disk at a great price for a popular movie. If you like twilight movies, you cannot go wrong at this price."
2,Can't believe people actually like this garbage.,"The acting is stilted, over the top. The story is lame and over dramatic. Bella is just dumb, and makes bad decisions, everyone is selfcentered and selfish (todays culter at least is reflected here). Cheesey when it is not trying to be. WAY,WAY, WAY, over hyped. Lameness at a major level. I would not have even checked it out if it was not for someone making me watch it with them."
5,"If you like the Twilight Saga earlier movies, you will love this one","There was so much more action and suspense in this 3rd installment plus all the characteristics that i loved from the earlier features - that I had to give it 5 stars. When you keep getting surprised in a positive way, that is a big accomplishment particular in these ""sagas"" of multiple movies that are part of the same storyline. What makes this so compeling to me is that the characters were well developed and interesting and there were no lose ends. Given that there were two more parts to the saga to come, I felt this one ended without a frustrating cliff hanger that would lend itself to an agonizing wait for the next installment a year later."
1,Eclipse blu-ray,The blu-ray disk would NOT play and since I put it in my player my other blu-rays that played before won't play now! (except for a couple of older ones)..... even one of the new DVD's I bought won't play!
1,"the movie itself is not that great, and the price ridiculous!!!","While the two disc special edition is a good idea, the price is ridiculous and the movie it's not that good. First of all, they edited a lot of stuff from even altered some things, like for example the story of the origins of the wolves, actually in the book it's more longer and exciting."
1,Amateur Level Acting,The acting in this moving was amateurish. The plot is boring and the storyline is very predictable. I do not recommend wasting time on this movie.
3,Good,"The film is good, but I wish there was more action, although the plot is like the previous films, fun, with a little suspense, there is a good mix."
5,great movie,"Blu-ray is the way to go with all the Twilight movies.I watch these movies at least once a day,the picture and sound make it seem like you could just reach and touch the actors."
2,Spanish cover is confusing. Doesn't match main product picture.,"Being a huge Twihard fan, I was excited about the low price of the 2-disc special. After receiving it in the mail, I was shocked to see the cover in English and in Spanish. I haven't opened it due to wanting to research it first and possibly return it before opening. Luckily, someone had written a review on the same subject and said it's all in English with a Spanish option. Puts me at ease so now I can finally watch my movie! It should be written in the item description not to freak out if you receive the bilingual cover, since it's confusing that the main picture on the page to order from, is all in english."
3,A decent Cliff Note version of the book,"After New Moon, I am not really expecting too much from the Twilight series anymore, however after saying that, I must admit that Eclipse was a decent film. It took me a long time to watch it due to the fact that Eclipse is my favorite book in the series and I didn't want to watch it get murdered on screen. But like the title depicts, they did a very rushed job of highlighting the main points while still staying true to the main point of the story. It seemed very rushed, but I appreciated that they kept some things in even if it was a side note. As far as Breaking Dawn goes, I think the movies will only make the book look better. I was not a fan, so thanks to Eclipse, I will be giving Breaking Dawn a chance now. :)"
4,Maybe it's just a phase...,I don't even remember when the Twilight series became important to me (or vampires for that matter). I was delighted when I found out there was a two-disc version available for Eclipse and that feeling grew after I purchased it and watched it. I wish all of the Twilight series had behind the scenes footage available. The two disc version of Eclipse was worth every penny.
3,Pretties was pretty good,"I have to say, I'd choose being ugly but with personality over being pretty and shallow any day, after reading this sequel. While Pretties carried on where Uglies left off, the protagonist, Tally, seemed like a completely different person. The plot was decent, and I have to say I loved the ending, but I missed the old spark the first book seemed to have. I also missed seeing Tally so close to David, and I was disappointed by the character of Zane. While I still plan to read Specials, the last book in the trilogy, I was nowhere near satisfyed with the continuation of such a promising story."
3,Bogus,I read Uglies and could not wait for the sequel and after buying the book i am completly let down. The plot was not as well put together as the first book and the new characters did not add depth. Totally bogus no bubbly here...What really let me down was the ending a Special?? Not what i was expecting not in the least. But i won't say anymore to spoil it. If you read the first book then read the second but if you have not read the first then skip this series.
4,A great continue,"Uglies had me hanging on to every word, and I also enjoyed reading this one. Tally is a sixteen-year-old girl who was turned pretty in this book, and therefore, as said in the first book, parts of her brain are blocked out. I was disappointed by how she could just move on past her normal life and all the friends that she left behind so easily, but I guess that's just from my point of view. Overall, Scott Westerfeld wrote a great follow-up to Uglies and I look forward to reading the third book."
5,Amazing,"I loved this book so much! It was an excellent sequel to uglies. I absolutely can't wait to read the next book in the series, Specials. This is an excellent choice for children and adults alike. It has a very easy to read style with great twists and turns. Not to mention an amazing cliffhanger! Read this book!!!"
2,Hate the Ending,"Grrrowl I was so mad when I got to the end of this book. It ends exactly like the first one, I really loved Uglies but the fact that the author couldn't think of anything creative that wasn't a ""pretty-headed"" version of the first book really annoys me. I will not be purchasing or reading the final book in this series."
4,Pretties: the second book in the trilogy,"This was a good book. After the cliff-hanger ending in Uglies, I especially wanted to see what would happen. However, I was somewhat disappointed.The plot is not quite as tight and well-planned, and I thought it was somewhat less creative than Uglies. It became just a little predictable, and I quickly tired of the romantic relationship between Tally and Zane. It just seemed like they rushed into the relationship, and seemed like an unlikely match anyway.That said, I am still a fan of this trilogy, and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes teen fiction and the culture-obsessed-with beauty thing. I am very happy that we still have Specials to look forward too."
1,Very slow,"The book uglies was pretty good. Now I am almost done with pretties and it is very very boring. I have gotten very annoyed by the use of the word ""bubbly"" and ""bogus"". They are used much too often. The book is very slow. I have not liked this book at all."
5,The Hardest-Core LA Punk EVER!!! (and I knew them well),"I remember the first Germs gig at the Whiskey A Go Go. Darby Crash (then known as Bobby Pin) and Teri were friends of mine and they completely blew the cover off the proverbial pot... LA was never the same. I still get a little sad listening to them, as We lost Darby some years back... but kids, PLEASE don't even CONSIDER calling yerselves Punk if you don't listen to these guys."
5,Must Have Luxury,"This book is so nice. It's inspiring, and I've given it as a gift many times. The nice leather binding makes it an instant treasure."
5,Great book - prompt service,The Valley of Vision is a powerful devotional tool as well as a great asset in worship leading tool. I would highly recommend it!
3,They Valley of Vision,The only problem I have with the book is that you ought to sell a dictionary along with it. think the working is a bit too much for the average person.
4,Exactly as I expected.,"This product is exactly as I expected. It is meant to be installed in a 90-degree corner so if your tub and wall don't meet at a right-angle, don't expect this MOLDED product to fit. Also meant to be installed by a person with more than half a brain and a tube of caulk. Perfect for my application but if you don't read the description before you buy, don't blame the product or Amazon because it doesn't work."
1,You call this a remaster?,"Well I pretty much agree that this is an underrated album by one of the better prog rock bands ever, what I want to discuss here is the sound quality of this so-called remaster. What was the remastering done on a Commadore 64? I have been dubbing alot of my vinyl onto cd when I pulled out my very used ""The Missing Piece"", and noticed a few scratches so I went to Amazon and bought the ""remastered"" edition. I have never been so disappointed with a cd until now. The highs are harsh and the bass response is almost none existent. DRT Entertainment should be ashamed of themselves to put out a ""remastered"" cd of this poor quality."
2,Don't bother,"I'm only a late commer to GG and respect their music for its complexity and musicianship.This is one of their last albums and is a sell out to the recording companies who wanted 'pop' tunes.If you like their previous albums, don't waste your time on this one. Lots of simple 4/4 tunes and little to recommend it."
4,FIVE stars...and you can DANCE to it!!,"The more I get old and years go by, and the more this album sinks into me as quintessential Gentle Giant! They are flirting here on a few tracks with power FM rock, and I hate power FM rock, but they do it with such finesse, humor and vigor, they still manage to sound like no one else but the Shulman brothers and their incredibly odd yet strongly creative, tight cohort of faithful musical partners...I know this is not Octopus. But Octopus is (supreme) progrock... While The Missing Piece is ...supreme God-knows-what, and I love it just for that!Was this ""Prog's done and over, long live the Giant""?... It didn't turn out exactly that way in the end, but I am sure ""For Nobody"" will live on forever anyway!"
3,Great Software - Poor Documentation,"As in all the versions of P/S, this one requires going to outside sources to learn its many hidden details and features. It is impossible to look up even the simplest of operational details in the manual provided. Someday someone will beat them out with a product that is inferior but well documented enough to prevent the learning curve frustration."
2,I didnt like it,Mario Moreno didnt get to really act in this movie. This one wasnt a true reflection of how great of an actor he was. There were some funny moments but not that many due to the story. The story never really came together although tried to. Cantinflas was an orphan with two of his friends and ends up in the show buisness. His father has been trying to find him and only remembers him by the mark on his stomach. The story tries to unfold from there. Its not worth buying unless you want to own every single Mario Moreno movie. If thats not you then skip on ahead to much better movies he has made.
2,Poor Quality,I know that it's an old movie so it's not going to be perfect quality but with the restoration technology around today this kind of quality is unexcusable. It seems like they just took the old film and played it on a projector and video taped that with a digital camera. My point is that it looks pirated. Also there are no subtitles- niether in english or spanish so deffinately DO NOT PURCHASE if you need subtitles for any reason.
5,One of the best kid movies ever,I like this movie even better than the original animated movie. It's a favorite for kids and adults in our house.
5,Memories--charolettes web,"This is a great movie. When my oldest daughter was a young girl (now 47) she loved the story--would read it over and over.-So I bought this for her and we watched it together--get the tissues out and ready.Again, amazon great to deal with in all facets."
5,Best Movie Ever,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies, even though I am no longer a child. I saw this movie in the theater and then bought the DVD. The movie holds true to the story in the book, and is child-safe. Lots of funny moments, as well as some sad times, and some great lessons taught. A great wholesome movie."
3,"Great performances, not the best mix","The orchestra in this recording just sparkles in performance and in the clarity of the recording. The organ was apparently picked up by room microphones and lacks presence. The organ's level does not balance with the orchestra either. I've heard better vinyl LP recordings of some of this work, sound-wise and, in the case of the organist, performance-wise."
5,Highly unusual and appropriately notable,"Loved the mix of archival footage with re-enactments and interviews to paint a colorful portrait of a ground-zero in the world of Bohemian artists and rebels. My only complaint is the absence of identifying captions on some interviewees (ie., who they are and what is their claim-to-fame?). Otherwise, it's a documentary adventure that's enlightening and very entertaining."
1,Avoid,"I have purchased some products that were real garbage in my day, but this one is the worst. The locking mechanism did not work, and it could not be inserted into the plastic mailbox hole that it was supposed to go through. The entire thing was made out of the cheapest plastic. They probably ran off thousands of these things for about five cents each. After two hours of trying to insert the locking mechanism into the plastic using a sledgehammer, I tried to screw the latch onto the key cylinder. The key cylinder was too short to fit all the way through the housing, so the latch that would go up and down when you turned the key could not be attached. And in fact, once the mechanism was assembled as good as it could be, the key cylinder fell out since the holding screw could not be tightened. Tighten too much and the key could not be turned; tighten too little and the lock fell out. Save yourself real misery; don't buy this product. My rating of this product is: ""really sucks."""
4,MailMaster Mailbox,"All in all this is a good product. My only concern is that the lock could easily be removed from the front mailbox opening with a simple screwdriver thus negating any security. I screwed a block of wood in front of the lock on mine to eliminate that possibility. It is nice to have several days of mail accumulate without having to contact the post office and put on a ""hold""."
1,fit is very poor of assembled parts.,Both top doors will not shut all the way and stay shut. If you snap the top floor into place it pushes the rear door out and cannot be closed. The lock hole is too small for the lock.
1,nike presto digital,"Very dissapointed, do not purchase this watch. Blacked out and reset itself the first week I wore it. Not worth the money. If it comes into contact with water it becomes useless. I have several of them and all have done the same thing."
4,bookcase,Great looking book case a little smaller than I expected but fits perfectly with my bedroom decor.The assembly was really easy.
4,Solid Product - Best Value,"I bought this for $70. The solid wood is strong and the honey finish is wonderful. Assembling the furniture is easy and, after assembly, the construction is sturdy. I have deducted one star, because one of the front legs was cut a little vertically and the result is a little wobbling."
5,excellent autobiography,"This is a fascinating look from a different perspective at some of the major FBI incidents spanning a twenty-five year career that ended in retirement in 1995. Clint Van Zandt provides a little background material about his growing up and makes no apologies for being a family man who loves his country and his agency. However, the autobiography takes off with the specific incidents including some overseas especially the more famous ones like the 1985 siege of the Covenant, the 1993 Waco confrontation with the Branch Davidians, the Unabomber, and his paradigm suggestion that Oklahoma City was tied to Waco not the Middle East. This is an excellent autobiography of a dedicated law enforcement official who spent a career FACING DOWN EVIL as it is the behind the scenes look at these cases and more that will grip the audience.Harriet Klausner"
1,this is trash,"If you're hoping for tuff dubplate remixes, this is not the place to turn. ""A who sey mi dun"" is given a weak treatment; mad lion's track is nothing new; the dancehall classic ""If i was a rich girl"" gets re-licked on a pop beat. Jigsy and tony curtis have the only halfway-strong remix on this.The rest is a joke; weak foundation remixes of minor hits. There's a million other remixes to get, besides the hot ones you can cop on the street. why waste your time with this one?"
1,Boring,The main idea is good but the action is really slow. People waiting for things to happen! The cover looks like it was taken from a totaly different book.
1,Mission : Seek and Destroy,"Hey guys, I've got a new idea for a book..... it revolves around a group of operatives whose single-minded quest is to seek out and destroy the incriminating pictures and other damning evidence that Larry Bond must hold over the head of a poor publisher out there somewhere - that publisher being the one that has allowed such complete and utter drivel as ""Larry Bond's First Team"" (and - can you believe it - several sequels!!) to be printed and put out into the public domain for the unsuspecting public to waste their time on.Team assembled includes: (Name)""Codename""[Surname](Cardboard) ""Cutout"" [Characters](Absolutely) ""Inane"" [Plot](Embarrassing) ""Sexist"" [Dialogue](Hogan's) ""Heroes"" [Villains](Please) ""No"" [More]"
5,The warmest there is!,"I use these for both the bike and the boat, and I have never been cold. All I ware underneath is long underwear, and I am roasting. I am 5'11""; and 180bls. I got size 44 and there is plenty of room for layering. Very mobile also."
3,Has redeeming qualities,"This is the only Gentle Giant I've ever heard. I bought the LP on a lark, not too long after it came out I think (we're talking 1978), and while I wouldn't say it's a very favorite I've always had a fondness for it. Now, 32 years later, I finally get around to exploring the rest of their work and discover that this is considered their worst album, ""the laughingstock of their discography""! While I'm prepared to believe that their other work is even better, and will definitely give it a listen, I don't think fans should be embarrassed about this one. Okay, there are a couple of duds, but several of the songs definitely have something to say. ""Little Brown Bag"" is timeless, and ""No Stranger"" only gets more relevant by the year. I'm also fond of ""It's Only Goodbye"" and ""Words From The Wise"".Really, I would give it 3.5 stars if I could."
1,This is the worst movie ever,"This is the worst movie I've seen this year. The acting is horrible (Shannon Elizabeth should just stand there without saying anything) and the script tries to cram 100's of good ideas into 90 minutes. Granted, there is lots of potential with the idea of 12 evil ghosts being used to fuel an evil clockwork house, but 90 minutes is not enough time to set everything up for a fulfilling, blood splattering end. Basically, at the end of the flick, I was sitting there wondering how on earth these actors got cast, why the concept of ""undying, selfless love"" was written into a horror script and how chemistry goggles can allow one to see ghosts. If for no other reason, see it for the special effects and be sure to watch the DVD special features first so you know what the hell is going on while you watch the movie."
4,Interesting movie..,Wow! There is a large amount of action in this movie! It is a good movie but it can make you look behind you while in a room alone after you watch it..That's for sure. Whew!
3,OK,"This movie was not great. I either have seen too many scary movies and my senses have been dulled down, or this movie was not scary at all. The movie jumped from scene to scene with no plot explanation. The acting was good, but the story [was not good]. There is... nudity and terrible lack of needed blood. Not Great!!!!"
2,Predictable,"Thirteen Ghosts is about a machine. This machine was designed by a Man who was at the time possessed my Satan. Yes, Satan. If the plot doesn't seem stupid enough, it needs Ghosts to power it. Ghostbusters anyone? At the start we watch a ghost hunting scene with a ghost that looks it belongs in a Michael J Fox movie. As time progresses you find out that the 'demonic machine' needs to be powered by ghosts. If done right, it opens the 'Eye to Hell'.Save yourself a few bucks and don't rent this. It's awful"
3,"Could be better, could be worse.","When I rented this movie, I was afraid to watch it because my friends all said it was the scariest movie they'd seen in a while. So I watched the extra features on the ghosts first. That part was pretty cool; it was nice knowing about the ghosts before watching the movie. The effects were absolutely laudable, and the idea of using an all-glass house instead of a creepy, broken-down, piece of crap was great. But can we have a little bit of back-story, please? Why were these ghosts picked? What do they have anything to do with the dark Zodiac? What's that book thing they keep refering to? If the director and writer had put some explanation into the plot, this would have been an amazing movie."
1,13 Snores,"I'm no critic, and I still dislike this movie.. The acting was poor.. it's as if they're reading from scripts they've only just been handed an hour prior to filming. The plot was terribly predictable.. even without all of the overblown foreshadowing. The set was amazing and the effects skillfully done, but all wasted by an anti-climactic, snore of a story line. If you're hoping to get that frightening little rush that we sometimes enjoy so much from watching a horror flik, save your money.. this one has absolutely nothing to offer."
5,OOOH,This movie has some jump factor in it. The special effects are good and I think the story line is good.
2,Nothing New!,"In my opinion, this film its no scary. Dark Castle Enterainment produce this film, and also produce The House on Haunted Hill, so both films are allmost the same. This one, is more boring, because it doesnt make you belive that the things that happen are ""true"". The music its not good, and maybe the sounds are scary. I think the story is good, but they dont make a good film."
2,DVD's extras are putting perfume on a...,"...well, you know (if you've seen John Carpenter's They Live that is). 13 Ghosts takes the quaint little haunted house comedy by William Castle and tosses it into a blender with A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 and 4 (where it lifts its autoyard sequence) and Dark Castle's high octane remake of The House on Haunted Hill (where it takes everything else) and mixes up a rancid milkshake of a movie. Plotless (I've read the they started shooting the movie with an incomplete script, boy does THAT show) and pointless (having seen the exact same scenario played out in a far better manner in The House on Haunted Hill), 13 Ghosts is an utter waste of time. Stay with the House on the Hill, you'll be glad you did."
2,Not Very Good,"What can I say besides this movie is average AT BEST. Yes, the ghosts look cool but its all downhill from there. The acting is horrendous, except for Tony Shalhoub who gives a typically strong performance. The scares are virtually non-existant save for a few jolts only caused by sudden loud bangs following silence. The story is a corny haunted house-inhabited by ghosts one, upgraded technologically. If you're looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a scary movie, also look elsewhere. If you have you're heart set on a haunted house movie, go with the original (1963) The Haunting or The Changeling (1980). But if you must have a recent one, 1999's House on Haunted Hill is superior to Thirteen Ghosts."
3,'Thirteen Ghosts' Not As Good - But OK,"This is definatly a hard movie to review, especially its like one of those 1/2 good movies. The opening scene in the movie was definatly hard to follow, and I feel like we needed to get deeper into the characters and know whats going on. We just jump into an action scene we have no idea what is going on, until pretty much the middle of the movie. The acting was somewhat good, but Shannon Elizabeth's acting was terrible in this movie, and I think she needs to stick to being Nadia on American Pie - she speaks a different language. The Ghosts in the movie are somewhat frightning at first, but you only get sudden glimpses of them and it kind of gets annoying. All in all, the movie has a good story, but I think the movie could have gotten even deeper, considering its a story about ghosts with lost souls..."
3,Did they change directors midway?,"I especially liked the bathroom scene with the ghost and the daughter. If all the ghosts had scenes interacting with the people, then the movie would have kept me chilled. The ghosts needed a background or more depth. I loved the make-up and design of the movie but the screenplay lacked information. The first half of the movie was creepy, the second half was dull. If you like special effects, this movie is entertaining enough."
5,Thirteen Ghosts,DVD arrived in time for us to watch it for Halloween. Was in good condition. Everything went smoothly.
1,WOW!,"Amazing! Spectacular! Stupendous! Superb! SIMPLY PHENOMENAL!It's extraordinary! ..that this movie was ever even contemplated by a human being with more than 4 brain cells to spare. I mean c'mon; how low are they going to sink with these idiotic new age piles of dung? Think about this..Was there a single character in there that was even remotely creative? Were any of them *actually* scary? Does Shannon Elizabeth have any similarity to Tony Shalhoub? They didn't go overboard with this movie - more like they went under the desk (you know what I mean) to get any producer to accept the title as worthy of being viewed by people that aren't blind and deaf.""That's all I have to say about that."" -Forrest Gump"
1,What a Joke,I am an avid horror movie fan but this movie was a total joke. The only thing it did have going for it were the acting and special effects but other than that it was horrible. It falls into the remake of The Haunting.....TOTAL OVERKILL!!!
2,"Not THAT bad, but...","But it reminded me how much the late 90's/early 00's sucked for horror movies! Most of the ""big"" horror movies from back then (including this one) have dumb plots, dumb characters, clichés, stupid and/or predictable twists, endings that don't make much sense, an abundance of cheap jump scares, ... It's as if those who made them thought that having a lot of special effects was more important than having a good plot, good characters, good scares, etc... This movie, The Haunting, Ghost Ship, House on Haunted Hill (I liked it a bit though), Fear Dot Com, Phantoms, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, Jason X, The Rage: Carrie 2, Blair Witch 2, etc... are all very lame. Many of them were made with big budgets, but they all feel cheap. Seriously, the horror genre is much better today! and of course, it was much better before the 90's.Don't get me wrong though, I know that some horror movies from the late 90's/early 00's are great."
2,A book of questionable value,"Fonoroff's book has a special place in the library of Hong Kong film studies, since his is the only one written so far (at least in English) by a critic actually living and working in Hong Kong; but his reviews are so consistently negative that the book has little value as either entertainment or useful guide. It doesn't help that the only film I could find that he gave a four-star review to (ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA II) was one that he happened to have a strong supporting role as an actor in. While there are some interesting items in the book in regards to the Hong Kong film industry, there simply aren't enough to make it worth wading through Fonoroff's continuous seeming hatred of his subject."
5,D-Generation X!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"A must buy. Put it in the CD player in the locker room before a game, and you'll be ready to lay the smack down. A couple chokeslams & elbow drops in the locker room on some of your jabronie teammates will pump you up big time. As you exit the locker room & enter the gym, with dX starting to be played over the loudspeakers, the crowd is going nuts, you'll be in the zone for whatever you're doing."
5,Kick @$$,"The Best. My only complaint it needed the most recent music for example the Rock, Mankind and Bossman's and Test's as well."
2,Its ok,"I just purchased a glass top stove and bought this because of the protective bottom. However, after using it several times, I would choose a different grill because of the following reasons:#1 The spatter mess - there is virutally no way to prevent splatter when using this pan creating an unneccessary amount of post-cooking clean-up.#2 There is no option of purchasing a lid#3 The pan itself has an odd rectangular shape that does not fit on one burner or two for that matter. Thus, somewhere while cooking you have a cool spot."
2,Good for general psych but not for shelf exam,I went through this book twice before taking the shelf exam. The questions in this book is too simple and straight forward. The questions on the shelf exam is very difficult and complex (i.e. a patient with a manic episode 20 years ago now shows up with depressed symptoms. what is the diagnosis?). I would recommend studying First Aid or any other resources and memorizing the DSM4 criteria for all of the major psych diseases for the shelf exam.
3,Good for the first game of the series,"This game is only good if you have never played a guitar hero game in your life. The song selection is great, but if you've experienced the hammer-on improvements of GH2 and GH3, you will hate this game. DO NOT BUY if you've played the other GH games, you won't like it, even if you're buying for the song list. However, new people to GH will love this game!"
4,Great party game,"This is a very fun game. Personnally I think it has better songs than GHs 2 or 3, but it doesn't have the practice mode, that is the only downside. Overall a great game, especially for parties."
4,Guitar Hero Vs. Guitar Hero 2,"This game is alright. The hammer-ons and pulls offs are kind of a joke. Guitar Hero 2 is much better... it has more diversity. I can't help but get the game because it has Cowboys From Hell, Symphony of Destruction... and some other great riffy songs. Gotta have both games to jam the good stuff."
5,Superman ROCKS,I had never seen the first four movies and I had been badly wanting this for years but now I regret having got it because apparently there will be another movie but its ok cus superman is #1 packaging arrived a bit dented but its ok its happens when you order stuff through the mail
4,Supermom picks super Christmas gift.,"I ordered this item as a gift for my husband for Christmas, and it arrived in excellent condition. Just one caveat - I didn't know that this collection was included in the group that had the wrong DVDs shipped inside it. Although my husband was able to send away for the correct ones, it sort of takes away from the whole ""giving a great gift"" experience."
1,Possibly Worst DVD Set Production EVER!,"And not because of the content of the DVDs. The movies themselves are fine; although deep down inside everyone was a little disappointed in Superman Returns. I have purchased and exchanged this set 3 TIMES! First time, not all of the DVDs were functional. Second time, DVDs' special features fiasco. Third time, the DVDs' case was broken and the discs were loose and got scratched. Tired of this, I finally kept the set that I had on hand. However, it's worth noting that the DVDs were out of order in the case, which makes some peoples' complaints about receiving duplicate discs and missing others more plausible.How could Warner Bros. mess this up so badly? It's Superman for crying out loud!! He is one of their flagship franchises! I have hundreds of DVDs and have never experienced this much difficulty in finding a quality copy of a boxed set. I will think long and hard before buying any more DVD sets from Warner Bros."
1,I was not happy with the movies,I watch two of the movies. they both would stop playing. I was not happy so I sent them back.
1,Problems with Warner Brothers Production.....,"This is more of a review on Warner Brothers than Amazon. The set has the problem that people have been talking about. Discs 1 and 8 are defective and missing features. Then on top of that problem disc 2 of Superman Returns and The Look Up in the Sky Doc are completely missing from the set. Instead I received multiple duplicates of other discs. Warner Brothers serious mishandled this problem. I called the 800 number and was told that they could send out replacement discs for 1 and 8 but that the others were my problem and I should take this up with Amazon. Seeing as it was Warner Bros production problem, I don't see the logic in that. Warner Brothers dropped the ball on this release and in it's customer service."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SET!,"Statement from Warner Home Video, November 27, 2006Bonus content was omitted from the ""Superman III Deluxe Edition"" in the 14-disc ""Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition."" Furthermore, disc one of ""Superman: The Movie Four Disc Special Edition"" did not include the Dolby Digital 2.0 mix. Neither disc is known to be physically defective in any way.Warner Home Video wants to extend apologies to all of our loyal Superman fans who've waited so patiently for these great collections and has taken immediate steps to correct these errors with the intention of standing behind our product 100%.Replacement discs can be obtained by calling: 800-553-6937. The exchange program applies only to purchases of the ""Superman III Deluxe Edition"" in the ""Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition"" and to disc one of ""Superman: The Movie Four Disc Special Edition,"" available as a single title, as well as in ""The Christopher Reeve Superman Collection"" and in the ""Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition."""
2,David Sklansky is a better player than he is a teacher...,"I have read two of Slansky's poker books now, and I feel they helped me only modestly. I know he's supposed to be the best poker author, but I feel in this book he gives very few examples of his concepts, and sometimes he spends too little time on a topic that deserves more thorough explanation. Some key topics are covered in less than one page, that's just not enough detail! Maybe it's just my personal preference, but other Poker books I read were more helpful."
2,Not that useful.. save your money,"Bought this book and the tournament poker book by McEvoy/Cloutier at the same time.. and the other book is much, much, much better... If you have basic knowledge of poker, and any common sense at all, the information in this book is stuff you already know. I highly reccomend the other book, though.."
5,Great War Movie,"When I bought the pre-quel to this movie I didn't realize it was a triology. The movie is wonderfully done and if you have any civil war or history buffs in your family, this movie is a must. It is done in a way so that you feel as though you know a lot more about the ""men"" that fought and died not just the facts and gruesomeness of it all."
4,"Great Movie, came better than expected","The movie was in mint condition and even arrived earlier than expected. Granted my company's mailroom slowed it down getting it to me, it still came early.Thanks."
2,TOO LONG!,The movie was ok. But for one thing it was tooooooooooo long. I fell asleep during it. It would not have seemed so long if they had made the battles longer and the talking alot shorter.
2,Gettysburg,I was totally disappointed that I received a DVD from out of the country that was not compatible with my DVD player. I did not expect to receive a DVD from out of the country. I had to pay almost as much in postage as what the DVD cost me. I would appreciate a refund for my postage. Thank you for your consideration.
4,"Good Theater, Fictional, but Good","Look, there is so little out there for Civil War buffs that this one rates high just on its production alone. But don't be confused about its historical accuracy. The Killer Angels, the book on which this movie is based, is a fictional recounting of the battle. Sure, it weaves in enough fact that it keeps it interesting, but I fear people will watch this film then think they have a clear understanding of the battle. It's great entertainment, but if you're interested in having a knowledge of the battle that goes beyond the elementary, this movie is not the place to gather your facts. Gettysburg is definitely worth the time and money. Just keep it in perspective."
4,Excellent,This movies was excellent. I enjoyed ecery minute of the movie and I hope that everyone sees this wonderful made movie. The cast was great. I couldn't get out of my seat.
5,To die for!,"I have seen this movie 156 times and have memorized it in English, French, and partly in German.An unhealthy obsession exists between me and this movie and it won't die. It's that good. Also, not only is it a great movie but the soundtrack is memorable as well. Unfortunaly there are 126 historical errors with this movie but the average viewer won't be able to catch them, only seriously obsessed history students like me would.Buy this movie!-""The trees, head for the trees!""-L. Armistead (NOT Accurate. Actual quote: ""Move twords those trees!"")"
2,"Gettysburg, Ride with the Devil & Field of dreams","All the above movies are great films. The reason for the 2-star is Amazon's terrible instant video feed. For ages, I didn't have any problem with your feed then you tried to fix something that wasn't broken. As I stated in my Numerous emails to support the problem has to be on your end, as I get tremendous feeds from other online providers. I can stop an Amazon poor feed and then go to Hulu and get a great feed. I am not upgrading to Prime Membership because of your poor instant video"
5,A classic,"I adore this movie. I saw it in the theater back when I was a teenager, and it inspired 2 years of spring break tours of Civil War sites with my family. At 4 hours, it's long, but it never feels overlong. The editing is tight, the acting is fantastic, the score is gorgeous, and the subject matter is compelling. It's based on Michael Shaara's The Killer Angels, but transfers the moving story without the sometimes ponderous prose. A perfect choice for American history classes or anyone interested in the Civil War or American history in general."
4,Excellent movie despite the beards,"I really enjoy this movie. The depiction of how the battle evolved, and how Lee's overconfidence doomed his invasion was quite an accomplishment. Pickett's charge was especially moving. I thought Berenger did a great job of playing the role of General Longstreet and many of the other parts were performed admirably.One gripe I have is the beards. Some of them were so phoney looking I couldn't help myself from laughing. If they were to do it over again, they would need either a new make-up artist or make the actors grow a beard for the movie.Another thing I really like about the movie is the score. Truly moving music to accompany a military drama that shaped the course of events in our country."
5,A True Classic,"For me, a good movie is not one that only entertains, but also educates. This movie really started to pique my interest in the Civil War and I don't think I can ever get tired of watching it. I really believe Jeff Daniels should've been nominated for an oscar for his portrayal as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain."
5,Authentic and Accurate! A Must See for all Americans,"Not being a Civil War buff I was a little apprehensive when I purchased this movie. I figured that it would be a documentary with actors. I had also heard that it was the longest movie ever made. When I got it I planned to watch it in two sittings due to the length of the movie. I was so engrossed in the film that I had to watch it all in one sitting. The movie was very well done and four plus hours seemed to pass like a couple of hours. I highly recommend this movie to all viewers. It will make you proud to be an American. The movie does not display the South as evil and North as good which is typical in most Hollywood Civil War movies. Instead it gives you a real insight to the folks who fought this war not justifying one side or the other but basically presenting it as an American tragedy, which it undeniably was."
5,My All-Time Favorite Movie,"OUTSTANDING! Although ""Gettysburg"" does not follow every aspect of the battle, the depiction of the personal struggles in the midst of fierce battle make this a video everyone should own. Perfect with one exception. Martin Sheen displays none of the qualities that so endeared the confederate soldiers to Lee. His faith in the Bible looked cultish, and Sheen (as Lee) appeared to be mentally unbalanced. In regards to Lee, a poor performance and poor casting. The casting and performances of others more than made up for Sheen; especially Jeff Daniels as J.L Chamberlain. BUY THIS VIDEO!"
5,Gettysburg - Learn History while being entertained,Very well done. Historically accurate. Acting is very professional and holds your attention for the duration of the film. I love it.
4,Gettysburg,"Historically accurate, good characterization. Portrays the actual battlefield and three day event of the turning point of the Civil War."
1,Fix Bayonets!,"Until the action sequences and battle simulations, this thing plods. The script is very poor. Martin Sheen turns in another wooden portrayal. It had to be long to cover the three days of battle, but basically the only worthwhile aspect is the action, beginning with the struggle on Little Round Top. Using reenactors and authentic locations was about the only good idea at work in this thing. Despite all that, probably worth seeing, just for the action, and here and there some of the performances."
4,Long but very well done....,This movie is very acurate but does drag in certain places. The director does a very fine job of re-creating the battles. I am a Civil War enthusiat but not all consumed by the war and found this movie to be worth my while. I recomend you play the directors comments at the end of the movie...very interesting.
5,Excellent edition of the complete works,"If you want the complete works on a budget, this is the best choice. It's the full Arden text, with a good glossary at the end of the book. Each play begins with a brief introductory note. You don't get the extensive footnotes of the individual Arden plays, but for many readers, that's a bonus."
3,Unfulfilled desire,"""Nothing short of violent rape would do"" is Tod's line when he becomes frustrated with a whore's refusal to sleep with him. Violence is what this novel is abount. West is trying to warn us all about a society that is becoming so violent that the only entertainment is watching planes crash in a blazing heap from the sky. He dosen't take full of his oppurtunity, in my opinion this novel falls just a little bit short. West is a good writer but not a great writer."
3,Loony Tunes In Tinseltown,Short and easy to read novel depicting the fringes of society. The characters are all misfits and hanger-on's seeking miraculous cures from their failings by basking in the sunshine and glitz of Hollywood.The most beleivable character is an untalented actress and part time prostitute who drives men insane.The story seemed a bit unreal to me but then so is Hollywood.
3,strange,"The Day of the Locust was required reading for me so that may be one of the reasons that I did read it. I did however find it easy to read and almost enjoyable. The story flows nicely, but the end of the book left me asking, ""Why did I just waste my time reading that?"""
3,Characters on the fringe of 30's Hollywood,The movie industry is the draw and an incredibly odd collection of characters find themselves living marginalized lives in the shadow of early Hollywood. Their lives interact in a series of bizarre scenes fueled primarily by lust for the one female character who is completely self-absorbed and has somehow transformed the attention from men she encounters into her own fanasy version of celebrity.There is a dark undertone of violence that finally erupts in a random and surprising way that sems to be a rebellion against the perversion of reality that Hollywood represents.Not a great book..but a memorable one.
4,Very Cute Journal,"This is a very cute journal to capture special memories of your children. I am not using it to write letters to my children though, I am using it to record things they do or say that I want to always remember. My only complaint is that it is spiral bound and I'm afraid it won't last as long. But all in all, I like it and would recommend it to other mommys. =)"
5,Love this mommy journal!,"I love this Mommy journal. It's so easy to write precious moments in this book, the organization is great. What a treasure to have!"
3,"Nice boot, but not the one pictured","I like this boot, however, the one I received is not the one pictured. The boot I received has no straps and the upper shaft of the boot is different. It's still nice, but be warned that you might not be buying the one pictured."
3,Declines greatly in the second half of the season,"""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles: Season 2"" declines greatly in story quality and action in the second half of the season. The first half of season 2 is much like season 1, with similarly good stories, action, and characters, and there are even some improvements over season 1. But about half way through, everything stops dead, and the characters get very depressed. It's rather like many episodes of ""Battlestar Galactica"" where the characters just sit around, get drunk, and feel miserable. I had high hopes for this show, and I'm amazed that the writers couldn't have done a better job. If they were out of ideas, they should have quit and let others have a go. Reviewed 4/10/2009 after watching the entire season during its original broadcast."
1,Awful in every way,"I cannot believe the customer reviews of this series. I can only assume they're being sarcastic, because Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles is a huge pile of crap, all the way from the script to the cast and production. Utter, complete nonsense. It's an incredibly lousy storyline carried out by cheap dialogue by cheap actors (Brian Austin Green, are you kidding me?) all working together to smear an intelligent and exciting mythology; it's an insult to anyone claiming to be a Terminator fan. When this series is canceled it won't be a surprise to anyone."
3,"Started awesome, ended not-so-awesome","Something clearly changed between the first and second season. The first season contained delightful sub plots (a terminator being asked to prom; the mystery of the suicide of the high school girl) as well as some traditional franchise action with terminators chasing down John Connor. It was great fun. Then came the second season. The fun sub plots were simply dropped, John became a overly emotional, whining teenager. He also got a *really* annoying girlfriend (but good actress), and the plot line with the early development of SkyNet was... well boring and strung out.I was a big fan of this show in the first season. It's rare to find such a great set of actors and, for the first season, great writing. Too bad the ball got dropped here."
2,Second season very poor.,It wandered. Full of emotional turmoils instead of cyborgs. And I'm ashamed to say the liquid metal's terminator's acting was awful (despite being a fellow Scot). I would not recommend this season even to hardened fans of the series so far.
1,crap episode,don't wast you time watching this crap episode .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ...
5,Better than Season 1,"Ok, maybe not five star but four and a half rounded up. Some of the great suspense of the movies with a little annoying character development. People make some dumb choices in life or death situations. Wish there was a season 3."
4,"First Firefly, Now This",It seems to me that all great sci-fi shows get canceled way to soon with the exception of Battlestar Galactica of course. I never watched The Sarah Connor Chronicles until recently on Netflix and I love it. I can't believe it wouldn't run for another few seasons but I guess there are too many choices on tv and not enough sci-fi fans.
1,Error,I reviewed this erroneously & an figure out how to delete it. There doesn't seem to be a delete button. I also need 20 words so I guess I'll just jabber away.
5,One of the best most intelligent TV shows,"This is awesome, the TV budget allowed them to get away from the mindless cat-mouse dynamic of the movies (definitely more 3 than the others) into smart scripts full of great characters and human exploration. And seriously the action can sustain a 2 hour movie but it was not going to cut it for a whole series, and the respect the creator has shows, like he said in Bluray season 1, he had been waiting to tell the deeper story of Sarah Connor. There is still good action for a tv budget. It definitely has it missteps and flaws but few shows are as well written as this. Buy season one then buy season 2. Fox don't give us another creapility show, keep this. If not I hope FX picks it up."
2,Horrible Ending.,"I watched this series it wan't great but it was fun - until the final episode. The ending made this whole series quite disappointing and unworthy of the Terminator Franchise.In the final episode John time travels, and ends up in a future where no one knows him. He doesn't exist in that future. The series ended with Skynet getting exactly what it wanted, a world without John Connor.That was intolerable!"
5,Blue-Ray all the way,"I just put myself on notification as to when the Blue Ray will be ready. I will be purchasing season 2, it was a very enjoyable season. Looking forward to Season 3....."
5,Was very please to learn about that forgotten world tour,"To tell you the truth, I've found ""The tout to end all tours"" more interesting that ""Spalding's World Tour"". Maybe because it features more interesting people such as Germany Schaefer, Jim Thorpe, Charly Comiskey, John McGraw and Christy Mathewson (who abandoned the tour before taking the Empress of Japan to the Orient and spared himself the horror of the trip).It was both a fun and informative read."
1,Lots in common with vacuum cleaners . . .,"Oh, it's authentic all right - an authentic pick-up band (hopefully) sight-reading isolated parts from marching band arrangements. Poor voicings, arrangements and technically sloppy - at best! I believe this is the worst recording I have ever heard of a more-or-less professional recording group. Buy it if you must, in quantity even, and make a beeline for the nearest skeet range so this recording will not have been made in vain. I do believe I smell horses . . ."
4,A GREAT CD!,This was a great CD. I loved it!I really enjoed the Snoopy and Red Barren songs. This is a must buy for any snoopy fan. The other songs on the CD are cool too.
3,lukewarm nostalgia fix,"I had been waiting for this band to come out on CD, however it would have been better to have rereleased their original ""Snoopy Versus The Red Baron"" recording. On it they did some great covers of songs such as ""Alley Oop"" ""Little Red Riding Hood"" and ""Peanut Butter"". I had enjoyed every song on it. It was one of the few albums I wore out the grooves in every cut. Until they put that original on CD I guess this anthology can keep me hoping. It's fun music even though some of the production sounds a little less than perfect."
4,Kottke shines in live recording,"Kottke is at his flowing best in this live recording. Having seen him live on several occasions, his studio albums occasionally seem lacking spirit, but live brings the true character of his music. He is a true performer - engaging the audience particularly in the rollicking tunes that are sprinkled throughout. A fine listening album - be careful palying it in a car as you can find yourslf galloping away..."
4,Pristine print of early Kubrick classic,"Kubrick's first major film gets a first-rate Blu-Ray release from Criterion ... PLUS an upgrade on DVD of his earlier ""Killer's Kiss."" Excellent supplements as well."
5,A great guide to getting back that youthful energy!,"I read this book about a month ago and began putting into action Ms. Monson's sugestions. I must say, they really work. If you are tired, run down and in need of vim and vigor - this guide is for you."
5,"Ground-breaking, extraordinary book.","Pat Donegan is a serious American poet who has taught with Allen Ginsberg and others at Naropa Institute and studied haiku in Japan with the then-leading Japanese master, Seishi Yamaguchi. Her co-translator, Yoshie Ishibashi, is descended from an old line of poets and artists and served as Seishi's and Donegan's translator, absorbing a deep appreciation for haiku in the process.Ishibashi's research and Donegan's excellent sense of the English needed for the translations, plus the many rich extras in this carefully designed and organized book (full kasen by Chiyo-ni and colleagues, excellent intro, etc.) all combine to make this a must-have for any serious student of haiku. Goes a long way toward redressing the unwarranted bad rap laid on Japanese women haiku poets.Notes by William J. Higginson (The Haiku Handbook, The Haiku Seasons, Haiku World, etc.)"
4,Belly Dancing Greats,This CD was originally published in LP form in 1973. I danced to it as a little girl and found it thrilling to dance to. I recently broke out my old album and it was still just as exciting to dance to as it was 30 years ago. It is definately a must have for Belly Dancers.
5,FUTURAMA WAS REALLY A HYSTERICALLY FUNNY SHOW.,"At age 57, I can tell you folks that Futurama was really a funny show. I loved it. FOX drove me nuts -- by pre-empting it & various other weird stuff they did -- I missed a lot of episodes. (Because it was on so early, I often was in the kitchen -- but if they actually decided to show it, I usually had it on tape.) Anyhoo, I'm glad they didn't waste a lot of time putting it out on DVD."
2,"Sometimes base and vulgar, yet funny","This set of cartoons are mostly sarcastic, sometimes base and vulgar, revealing, for what cartoons can reveal, and yet even funny, that is if one can get past the afronting style of the writers. I would not recommend this for children."
4,"a typical, well written and exciting slammers story","David Drake comes through again with another excellent slammers story. The action is very realistic as are the characters response to war. Any war story fan should pick up this book (and all the slammers stories). These stories were written by a veteran of the Vietnam war and it shows. This book depicts a slammers infantry unit which is a bit unusual for the series. There are no supertanks demolishing things with their main guns. The action is more personal and on a smaller scale, but no less exciting or involving"
2,"Review the music not the politics (to Järvenpää, Finland)","I am frankly appalled at this review. How can you call this the ""democratic Allende period in Chile""? It was an oppressive communist regime where people where regularly disappeared, tortured and expelled from there homes. As a member of a family that suffered loss of property and life under this ""democratic Allende period in Chile"" I am insulted and disgusted at the reviewers lack of knowledge about this critical period in Chile's history. If you are going to write about it at least have the decency to read up on the subject before making a fool of yourself. Or just simply review the music don't attempt to review the politics, you obviously do not have an adequate grasp of the subject."
5,A Classic,This is a great piece of history & a greater love story set against the background of the Spanish Civil War.
4,not as good as the book AND still a wonderful flick,"The book is one of the finest novels ever written, imho. And basically, it is a love story.I've not seen a handful of movies that live up to a great book. This one does not.This one is a fine movie. The spark between Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman on camera ""makes"" this movie so good.As good as the book? That would be possible.A wonderful flick worth watching? You bet.It helps to have read the novel first.BTW, the novel is NOT boring. It is a work of art. Buy it and start it and you'll soon see why it is called a ""classic""--because it really is."
2,Hard to Pinpoint,"The most annoying part of the mvie is the casting. Robert Jordan is supposed to be a young blonde man, in his late 20's about, and Maria is supposed to be a 19 year old Spanish girl. Obviously, the movie missed that. The other actors fit farely well, but a lot of the accents were horrible.Also, the book always seemed to somehow use the love between Maria and Robert as a subplot. Robert's conflict with Pablo was just as important. The movie, however, is purely a love story. Overall I thought the book was decent, but slow moving. The movie was worse. Almost 3 hours of nothing.On a final note, to the person who said Jordan should be showing some signs of pain, and that it's ridiculous that he's so calm, read the book. His nerve is severed from the break. Can't feel a thing."
1,hard of hearing,This movie moved me to turn it off after an excruciatingly boring 20 minutes -- a complete waste of time and money.
1,not happy with,"When I received this ring, I put it aside because I was very ill at the timewhen I did look at it, it was past the time to return it. In the picture it looksround, but when i received it, it is more square than round. it justlooks odd and now I have a ring that is ugly and no one wants it."
3,"bang! big start, schlock finish....","Very good movie, chilling psychopath detective, Denzel Washington shepherds Ethan Hawke through a ""typical"" training day in LA, on the young officer's first day in a top narcotics squad.Last 25 min damage the movie quite a bit, lost opportinity for the director to make a real LA epic. worth a watch though! I was hoping for the promised showdown in Macarthur park. What the movie degenerated into was worthy of early 80's network junk."
3,TRAINING DAY,"I LIKED THE MOVIE. THOUGHT THAT DENZEL REALLY DID DESERVE AN OSCAR FOR THIS ROLE. HE PLAYED A RUTHLESS , AND VIOLENT COP THAT WAS ON THE DRUG FORCE,NO DOUBT THAT HE WAS BROUGHT DOWN NOT ONLY FROM BEING SUBJECTED TO THE STREETS FOR MANY YEARS , BUT ALSO A BIG CASE OF GREED. THE THINGS HE DID TO HIS NEW PARTNER REALLY UPSET ME,, AND I KEPT HOPING THROUOUT THE MOVIE THAT BENEATH IT ALL HE DID HAVE A HEART.WELL, THAT NEVER DID HAPPEN, AND IN THE END HE GOT WHAT HE DESERVED. BUT WHAT A MOVIE. MOVIE SEEMED PRETTY REALISTIC TO ME, LOT OF VIOLENCE."
3,Denzel makes this one great...,The strength of this movie is Denzel Washington and his ability to keep you wondering if he's a bad guy or a good guy. The first time I saw it I was a bit disappointed by the lack of principles and guts of the Ethan Hawk character... but the second time I watched it I realized how difficult it was for him to know whether he was being tested or corrupted. He was in over his head and he knew it.Very well written and really great acting!!!!
2,training day,"what a stupid movie. Hawke can't act, Denzel does his best A-hole, and all with a plot that any rookie cop could shoot holes though.I meen COME ON if hawke didn't know know that he was being set up in the first five minutes he deserves to get busted.it sure show's the poor taste of the oscars that they gave Denzel an award for his worst preformance yet."
4,This movie was hot!,I really liked Denzel role in this movie. I think his role in Malcolm X was way better. But atleast he finally got the credit his acting deserves.
1,Mindless,"This is perhaps one of the worst and most mindless movies i've ever seen. Their is no semblence of plot and the movie has a feel of aimlessness. It doesn't feel like its going anywhere. Its filled with tons of meaningless violence and macho garbage that are the staple of movies aimed at younger males but it lacks a compelling story to go along with it. The ending where the rookie cop leaves the crooked cop to die and somehow he is let free (though we don't see how) before being shot by russians that are mentioned twice in the movie but not brought into the plot is terrible. On the plus Denzel shows his acting talent, but even he cannot save a film that lacks both plot and meaning."
4,Denzel shines in this cop thriller,"Earning Denzel Washington an Oscar for his bad guy persona, Training Day is an engaging film examining the events of one day in the life of a crooked cop and his innocent protégé.At the center of the film are the on-the-spot performances of Washington and Ethan Hawke. Clearly the change in role for Denzel energized him profoundly in bringing his bad cop character to life. Though not as celebrated, Hawke is also excellent, portraying an eager Narc in training. These two grab you right in and hold you for the duration of the film.The powerful story, though, is just as absorbing. Without spoiling too much, the corruption that Hawke's character witnesses through the course of the day is shocking and lands him into a situation he may not get out of alive.Though the film at times falls back on some standard movie devices, overall it's fully entertaining and hard to stop watching. It's definitely a character movie to see more then once."
5,one of the best,"This movie ranks up there, along with 'seven', 'fight club' and 'the shawhank redemption', as one of the best i have seen in a long time. Denzel washington plays a startling role as the 'bad guy' and plays it extremely well, very deserving of an oscar. The thought of him having a bad guy role intrigued me so much that i saw it in the theater and then bought it the first day it was on sale. Ethan Hawke also gives a strong performance in what i feel was a title character role stolen by the awesome presence of Washington. This dvd spends the most time in my player than any of my other movies. I strongly recomend this movie to any person whether you like cop drama movies or not."
5,Disappointed for the wrong reason...,"Don't get me wrong. I loved this movie. Probably one of my favorites and definately one of the best in summer cinema. If you're planning to buy it, stop planning and just do it.But I have only one complaint. Is it just me, or did Ethan Hawke not get enough recognition for his role? Not even a ""Best Supporting Actor""? This man spent 80% of the movie getting the snot beat out of him. The least he could get was a seat wtih Oprah. Not that I don't think that Denzel did an amazingly outstanding job; I just think that Hawke played his role wonderfully, and got next to no recognition for it. That made me sad.Okay, so I laughed a little. But I did feel bad."
1,FAR TOO VIOLENT FOR MY TASTE,"Not a typical role for Denzel, but being that I love his acting abiity I thought I would watch the movie. Suffice it to say that the movie was far more violent for my taste, and the ending wasn't to my liking....I thought it would have been far more satisfying to have denzels character caught and punished for his crimes rather than to see him go down like that....I felt like it was the same o' same o' sterotype of the african-american male who is either a drug-dealer, rapist, murderer etc. I left the theater feeling disgusted, utterly disatisfied and that the movie had been a total waste of my time and money..."
1,Worst movie that Denzel Washington has ever made.,I repeat the Worst Movie that Denzel Washington has ever made. And He has been in some of the best I have ever seen. As a former police officer I was insulted and repulsed by his portrail of this so called dectective. Enough said.
3,Subpar,"Denzel got an oscar for this, but I can't figure out why.The movie was average and the acting too, it was merely Denzel being himself. So why'd I give it a 3 instead of a 2?Well kids, there is a scene in this movie that is one of the most tense I have ever witnessed. Remember the scene in Boogie Nights where Sister Christian is playing in the background? Remember how tense that was? There is a scene in this movie that is twice as tense as that. It is incredible and makes the MOVIE WORTH WATCHING. No kidding."
4,enforcement wears no clothes,Morally bankrupt narc officer sabotages unsuspecting trainee before finally meeting his own commeupance. Inarguably Denzel Washington's greatest performance on screen.
1,Did not work when I received it.,the HDDVD that I received didn't work for me when I pop it into the player it said wrong format or something like that..
4,Good movie worth the buy,"I saw training day in the theaters the week of release, and loved it.It had s decent amount of action and denzel played a very good part, your never really sure if hes good or bad until the end.Im glad i saw it BEFORE he won his award, because if i did what almost all the people badmouthing this movie did and expect WONDERFUL acting and look and pry at the movie for plot holes i would never have enjoyed it.sure theres things that where not needed or things that didnt quite make sense but who cares, the story was good the movie was fun thats all that matters.Falling prey to any kind of hype can kill a movie experiance.Look at episode I, everyone expected THE BEST and when it wasnt the greatest thing they had ever seen...well the were dissapointed.Leave expectations of a Brilliant performance at the door and expect a courrupt police movie with good acting,action,and story and you will enjoy this movie."
2,I don't get it,There are several movies that I don't understand how in the world people can dislike them. Training Day falls into my second category of Why do so many people love this film. Sure Denzel did a great job (I'm still not sure it deserved an Oscar Nomination...never mind the award). Ethan was a tremendous supporting actor...but the movie was just a series of yelling matches. What was the point of this film? Why was Denzel's character the way he was? There was just something totally missing here.
1,A horrible movie,"I'm sorry to say that this movie was horrible. It is an insult to the policemen and women who serve our streets. While Denzel Washington's performance is good, as it normally is, it is not superb. The script was poor and shoddy. I have to say that Ethan Hawke's performance as the fresh new blood for Denzel Washington's elite Narcotics squad out did that of Denzel's perfomance. Overall this movie made me sick and sorry for even watching it."
1,The most mundane cliched junk I've seen in a long time.,Training Day is mildly interesting in its previews and sets you up expecting a clever and scintillating day with a crooked cop. The only thing it truly succeeds at is pulling every cliche out of bad cop film history and throwing it out without even a scintilla of wit. The film is formulaic and very woman-hating from start to finish. Something more interesting to see would be Mamet's Heist.
2,One of the dumbest books I've ever read.....,"I don't like rating books with a 1 rating but it was a close decision with this one. This book was a waste of money and time and I only hope I can be convinced to read more VLT's books since this was my first.I hated all the euphemisms and how she made the female characters into such hicks. My family is originally from the south and even back in those days they didn't act or talk like these two women.I didn't like Gen or Jackson but did like the mother and Matt. One thing that bothered me about Annabelle though, was that she was 41 yrs. old but had thoughts like she was 80."
2,Predictable,"I thought I'd like this book because it sounded sexy, funny, imaginative. It was....in some parts of the book, but as a whole, it was predictable. The story line was cute, but the whole ""mom and boss"" romance was a let down. I gave this book two stars because some of it took me by surprise, but not much."
5,"Sexy, fun read!","""Nerd in Shining Armor"" by Vicki Lewis Thompson is a great book. This book has every thing:Great Characters, local to die for. This is the story of two people who would never think of hooking, but after crash landing on a desert island, they are forced to a second look at each other. A decide that they like what they see.Besides great main characters, Ms. Lewis-Thompson, gives the reader well developed secondary characters that work well in the story. Overall, this is a summer book that you don't want to miss!"
2,Let Down,"I found myself discouraged several times with character development and found Gen's character rude/unlikable. Why would the sweet/honorable Jack (at times too weak) have such strong feelings for some rude woman? Additionally, I expected follow through in the love scenes. It is part of their foundation and discussed numerous times, but left the reader 'outside' the magic. I am a fan of Mrs. Thompson's work and will continue to buy her books; I just hope this is not an example of future works."
4,pretty good guide,Considering the price this is a decent guide for tales of the sword coast. Good amount of maps and decent navigation I would recommend this book.
5,European sized wallet,"I expected a narrower wallet (for US sized bills), but was pleasantly surprised that I liked the larger format. It allows for another row of credit card pockets. I don't like the similar wallets that have an ID window on the outside, and this is perfect."
4,Comfortable and Stylish,"This wallet is great. I replaced an old, bulky leather wallet with a flip id flap. This wallet, fully stocked, is half the size and lets me sit down without half falling over from the size. It has 6 slots for cards as well as two openings for more on each side of its exterior. All together I am carrying 9 cards in it with ease. The interior money clip slides right into an opening on the back of the wallet allowing you to swap whether it clips your cash from the top or the bottom. My only gripe is actually a positive and that is that I cant' tell if it's in my pocket or not when I am walking around. If you need something simple and stylish I would definitely recommend this wallet."
2,It's not that great,I thought this would be a great movie because Jennifer Aniston was in it. I also loved the title but the movie turned about to be weird. The character's character changed abruptly and it was difficult to tell if they were being sarcastic or if they really changed (for a few minutes).
2,Not impressed,I was hoping it was going to be a funny movie. A lot of people from The State were in it so I knew it was going to be funny. Not so much. It had moments. I love Paul Rudd and thought he could be the reason the movie would be great...he wasn't. I enjoyed watching the movie but probably won't watch it again.
2,Disappointment,"Not worth the time. Good actors but that's about it - I expected more, especially after watching the funny preview. I stopped watching after a while...."
2,Must have been made by a bunch of teen boys.,"Horrible movie, it appears to be made by a bunch of teen boys that have never been with a girl. It really sucks and would never show this movie to anyone that is under age. Would have expected more from this cast.Not good."
1,"Really, really bad.",I'll watch a silly movie every now and then.... this was unbearably bad. I just don't understand what Jennifer Anniston and Paul Rudd were thinking!
1,"BAD, BAD, BAD",Worst movie I've seen in 5 years! The police department should use this movie as an interrogation tool. After 5 minutes I would confess.
3,very silly,this movie was completely over the top and silly. It did have some funny moments and was a comedy worth renting. It is very light and silly funny but not the best comedy.
4,Silly But Fun,"Crazy comedy about two city folks struggling in their relationship and environment, having to drive to Atlanta to ask Paul Rudd's obnoxious brother for a job. They stop for the night on the way down and end up in a hippie commune where folks like to live off the land and run around naked a lot. Place is a little too strange for Paul and Jennifer Aniston, so they pack up and go to Atlanta. Job sucks, brother makes life miserable, so they go back to Elysian Fields, and get caught up in the very funny lifestyle. A struggle over the property(owned by Alan Alda and several co-founders of the place)ensues, the couple gets back together and they help save the day. You will enjoy if you like broad humor, slapstick, and Jennifer going topless on the news to gain attention for the property battle. I might be a little bias in liking this film, because I appear in a cameo as one of the co-founders, Jerry Beaver."
5,Wunderlust,"Amazon instant videos always delivers the best picture and sound quality! Enjoy having Prime also! The movie selection in both instant video and Prime videos are amazing, and free shipping on most Amazon products make my Prime membership well worth having! Wunderlust with Jennifer Aniston was a great choice for comedy! Thank u Amazon! Mrs. Sheri Denato"
2,Not that impressed,"Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but this storyline struck me more as cognizant infidelity than curious exploration. Aniston's character abandons her inhibitions in record time and is suddenly deaf, dumb, and blind to her husband's feelings. The story felt forced and as a result, lost much in the way of humor."
2,Disappointing and cynical,"I had high hopes for this movie. The trailer looked pretty funny. I'm a big Paul Rudd fan. He was actually really great in this movie, but the story line SUCKED. It had a bazar cadence, with disheveled emotions. The end is especially stupid. What turned me off the most, is how this movie played on the stereo type that all earth friendly, hippy types who live an alternat life style, are in a cult. The leader of the commune in this movie is an egotistical jerk - right from the beginning. This is just such a main stream, cynical view of free thinking, spiritual, alternative, vegan, type of people. This movie just leaves a bad taste in you're mouth. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star, was that Paul Rudd and Jenifer Aniston were really good."
3,"kinda funny, but fell asleep",It's one of those movies that most of the funny parts you've already seen in the previews. My husband and I both ended up falling asleep and didn't finish the movie.
2,Nope,This movie went from worst to just plain bad. Even with named actors they could not carry this movie as it needed to be.
2,Dissappointed,I must say not one Jennifer Anistons best and I consider Myself a great fan.The Teaser Trailer was much Funnier than the movie as a whole..
1,"Plain, unpure, awful.....","I took a chance watching this movie starring Jennifer and Justin who appear to have an admirable off screen relationship. What a disappointment. I agree with all the 1-star ratings. These reviewers hit the nail on the head. The first thing that came to mind was ""B"" movie with a scholastic grade of D- for rotten storyline mixed with trashy dialogue. The best thing that came out of this movie must have been real life proposal. Maybe Justin will write a quality script and he and Jennifer can produce another movie to make up for this awful one as in: it only gets better from here."
4,Worth watching for the chilling end scene,"I sat through this movie simply because it was a Kubrick film. For the first fifty or so minutes, I was a bit bored, even though I saw some early Kubrick shots that would later make him the famous director he turned out to be. However, the ending scene is an early example of Kubrick's way of ""creeping"" the audience out, and was done quite well."
4,Brilliant,"The movie was incredible. Pure genius. The only problem I had with it was that the story moved too quickly (the movie's only 67 minutes long), but I guess that probably had to do with the budget."
4,"DESPITE ITS NON-KUBRICK ENDING, A BRILLIANT FILM","I doubt most self-confessed Kubrick fans have seen this movie.It's just over an hour long and even so we have the trademark Kubrick opening, where he takes his own sweet time in letting us know what the film is about but somehow draws us in all the same. The denouement is famously infamous for being a tad hollow, but this doesn't prevent it from being involving while it lasts.Kubrick once again demonstrated the he could point a camera at anything at all and make it interesting - the images are amazing, yet entirely functional. The movie is B&W, which I am not usually a fan of, but you'll love this on DVD. It's also a masterpiece of violence-without-violence, if you know what I mean.Give it a try, it's a brilliant piece of cinema. Kubrick in his element even in 1955."
3,Okay product for price,"I bought 2 of these covers and tried them out during a mixed ice/rain/snow storm. The covers functioned very well. The car was iced over and snowed over, but the winshield remained dry, clean and ice free. The only drawback is the quality of the material. The suction cups that are supposed to hold the cover in place while you close the doors do not work. The material used to make this cover is very thin and seems very fragile. However, it works well for a $5 product. I might invest in a more expensive set later."
5,winter windshield cover,for the price i thought i'd givve it a try and bought each of my kids one since they aren't able to park in the garage and i'm surprised that they actually go out there every night and make sure its on. They say it works great and saves alot of time in the morning before going to work. and it so simple to put on and the snow just falls right off it and its light weight and easy to fold up and put away
5,Good Shit,Very good stuff ... its amazing that the guitar player is only 18 and doing stuff at this quality not to mention that he's also in Wintersun....Imperanon has there own sound that sets them apart but still stays close to the usual finnish melodic death metal sound....very good CD
4,Great live versions of tunes from my favorite solo album,I really feel like 'The Old Kit Bag' is perhaps RT strongest solo album in the last 10 years. Most of the tracks on Ducknapped are live versions of songs from that album and they are excellent. I really like the tune 'Bank Vault in Heaven' it has some tremendous guitar solos that are worth the price of the album.
5,Outstanding,"I bought this for the Audio DVD to demonstrate a 5.1 car audio system.Its a re-master of Beatles classics and its perfect. Its familiar material, but it still brings a smile to your face as the re-mix is like hearing the Beatles for the first time. The regular remixed CD is a treat but the 5.1 experience blows it away. Highly recommended."
4,The Beatles 5.1,"Love was created by Beatles producer George Martin and his son Nigel in collaboration with Cirque du Soleil for a Las Vegas stage show. It is being called a Beatles mash-up album, but it is a little different from your usual mash-ups. Unlike the infamous Grey Album which mixed Beatles music with Jay-Z vocals, everything here is from the Beatles themselves. Also, many of the songs are true mash-ups, but rather they have snippets of other songs tacked on near the end of the track. None of the song combinations are truly startling or revolutionary. That being said, the DVD audio version's sound is simply amazing. The songs leap out of the speakers with a new clarity that makes for a new listening experience to songs you've probably heard a hundred times each. This makes one hope that they will release the complete Beatles catalog in 5.1 surround sound."
3,Pointless Without The Show.,"Without the visual show to accompany this, I find it to be pretty pointless. The sound isn't all that ""improved"", the collages not that interesting, (to me anyway...)It just makes me want to listen to the original recordings and wait to see the performances that accompany this project. I'm certain that the spectacle taken as a whole will be far more rewarding than this hash."
3,Interesting but....,"This is interesting to listen to but I am still in confusion of why some of the songs are considered for a ""Love"" recording."
4,"Very creative, yet respects the Beatles original songs","This is good music! The new mixes of the songs do take some getting used to because a Beatles fan expects to hear certain things in certain places. Kindof fun to pick out the pieces from different songs and play ""name that tune."""
1,Fraud,"This sells looks like DVD movie and CD music, but the reality is that both are the same, the DVD is not the movie nor even have fotos , just the picture of the cover and the same music that already have the CD. They should put an advice that the DVD is just the same music and have no images."
1,Love/refund,I returned this item weeks ago and still have not received a refund. I am really not happy with your service right now.
1,DESERVES NO STARS WHATSOEVER,"It seems in the state of California [and perhaps nationwide] you can not return a CD, due to copyright laws, even when it's deceptively packaged.In the retail store [I knew I should have previewed it on Amazon] you have absolutely no indication that this is not really a Beatle's recording. It was not until I opened it and listened to it and had access to the INSIDE of the jewel case, and voila, the true nature of this CD's origins are made clear - it is a horrible mishmash of sounds and lyrics and junk. I explained my dilemma to the Target customer service rep, but I had no recourse. I hate this CD and no one should waste this kind of $ to purchase it - I could have spent my $15 on Magical Mystery Tour. Lesson learned: Always check with Amazon before buying a product you're unfamiliar with."
5,Love It,"An excellent compilation and remixing of the Beatle's canon. Fresh takes on still-fresh compositions. No group has ever approached the consistently high standards of The Boys, except for perhaps George Martin himself, who's input and taste underpin this collection. A must-have for the Beatles fan of any age or degree of devotion. It's, uh, Fab!"
4,"A 45 Year ""LOVE"" Affair","Having been there when Beatlemania hit, and having followed every note since then from the Beatles and then individually, my hopes where as high as Lucy. In fact, I gave 25 copies as gifts to my colleagues over the Christmas season.I love every note, every bit of the production done by long time ""Beatle"" George Martin and his son, and every transition and inter weave of songs. I have listened several times and will do so again today in my hobby room.I am giving it only 4 stars instead of 5 though. I have heard ""mixes"" and ""blends"" of too many songs to think this is novel or unique. The quality is 1st rate and one can't go wrong with the material. My preference of all time Beatle music though is a toss up between the BBC recordings and the 3 part set that included studio outakes and variations.With this said I do suggest a copy for the car and one for the home."
3,"Fresh and entertaining, not worth the money","The transitions and the combination of the different songs provides a fresh take on classic tracks. I enjoyed it, but would not buy it again. There is a special quality to the Beatles original albums that this compilation can not reach."
1,"Reinventing the ""Wheel and Deal""","The chief question this misguided CD raises is -- why in the world do you try to remix songs that were perfect to begin with? The answer, of course, is that there is a new generation of money-spending boys and girls who can plunk down $25 to hear someone's garbled retake on that perfection. That the ""someone"" in this case was once affiliated with The Beatles does not excuse this money-grubbing, but seems to make it all the more egregious. For God's sake, kids, just get the real thing. This watered down semblance gives you the the wrong idea."
1,Unecessary and pointless,"This album is a complete waste of space and does not deserve to have been made. I am not going to fight and try and prove just how much I love the Beatles... Too many of us have made such statements to show to our fellow readers that our review is objective and all that jazz... Let's just say that this album is the final nail in the Beatles' coffin... Making sounds with prerecorded music, so that the masses can watch a bunch of talented - but incredibly uninspired - acrobats do pirouettes to this sterile and pathetic muzak, may convince some of us that there is a transcended value to all of this... Don't be fooled!!! There isn't!!! This album is total crap and bringing life to dead matter just doesn't make it any better... Frankenstein failed and so do these people... Free as a Bird wasn't bad enough... What's next, a production of the Rolling Stones Satan's Request? Oops, I've just given them an idea..."
3,Doesn't have all songs from the show.,"I mainly bought this album because I saw the live show and loved the version of the Blackbird song they played in FULL during the show. However, the CD only contains a few brief seconds of this song. All the other songs are great (different from the originals), but I really bought the album for the Blackbird song and felt a bit cheated."
2,oh yoko...,"oh yoko you did it again. I love The Beatles, but what has been done in this CD is unremarkable."
3,"The surround mix is great, the audio mix is not.","It's wonderful to hear the Beatles in DVD-Audio quality and superbly mixed surround. It's hard listening to the Beatles remixed to pop beats and other fluffery. There are many points on this DVD-Audio that I love and keep going back to over and over again. Then there are other parts that repulse me. Eleanor Rigby starts with such well mixed harmony, I listen to it regularly and use it show off the full potential of DVD-Audio. Strawberry Fields suddenly morphs midway into modern beat and it ruins the song entirely.The music deserves no more than 2 stars but the surround mix and audio quality deserve 5. Oh so torn. But I do hope this spawns some more DVD-Audios from the Beatles original works, in stereo or surround."
1,poo on a shiny plastic disc!!!,"Man this is bad - so bad i would rather listen to the Backstreet Boys or Brtiney Spears. But it's the Beatles i hear you cry!!!! You wanna know why i think it's crap - because it adds nothing to their legacy and gives EMI or whoever a chance to make more money of their back catalogue. These mix-ups are not inventive or even vaguely interesting, just a few sound effects here or there. Save some money and buy say a Wings album like London Town or Red Rose Speedway if you need a new Beatles fix."
5,Love is all you need,"besides all the others Cds from the Beatles. Love is a masterpiece. The Dvd should have something else besides the songs. Anyway, I LOVEd it."
1,If I could give it 0 stars...,"The truth is I am very unhappy with the cd release. I can understand the reasons why they produced the album, and why many would like it. But I was expecting a much different album where they mixed and sampled the different tracks in order to create brand new songs. A few added riffs or segues doesn't necessarily improve a song, and in general I felt that the ""new"" songs sounded too close to the originals (in some cases, identical). If you expect a revolutionary change to the classic Beatles songs, then it'd be better to look for something else."
1,i need help,"even I do not receive the product, I need its aid to locate it, or send me an I number of guides or reference"
4,LOVEd It,"It seems as if the Grey Album may have been the inspiration for this- but what the heck! What makes this album nice is that with a little creative editing, you can have a preview of what the remastered versions of a few songs will sound like, most notably ""Revolution"" and ""Yesterday.""My favorite mash-ups are ""Tomorrow Never Knows/Within You Without You"" and ""Octopus's Garden"" (with its inventive use of ""Goodnight"" and Yellow Submarine"" snippets).It also makes sense to get the CD plus the Audio DVD if you're ever going to have a surround sound system. It didn't get five stars because it should have been more out there than it was, dig?"
3,How could this be??,"I can't think of a reason why you take 2 years of your life remixing an album and making rookie mistakes like the intro of ""Lady Madonna""... totally out of rythm when the piano comes in.""Here comes the sun"" and ""While my guitar gently weeps"" are the best of the album... There are several tracks that can have my total admiration for the work done over them, but there are a few that have some mistakes that could be prevented with simple plug-ins... If you are going to add a Guitar Solo from one song into another song,... you could modify a bit the notes that just don't go with the harmony. The solos everywhere were copied and pasted with no detailed attention...Overall it's a great job,... but it could have been better."
5,Outstanding!!!,"I've been a Beatles since I was 12 years old. I am now 54. There isn't a track that I don't like. Favorite being ""Drive My Car, The Word and What You're doing""I've been waiting to hear The Beatles in 5.1 surround sound. It's better than I expected. A Day in the Life in 5.1 is worth the price of the CD.I can only hope that George and Giles mix more from The Beatles catalog and that there is more coming in 5.1"
2,Anthology,"I bought the CD as a reaction to the movie ""Across the Universe"" and because I had heard a few cuts at a friend's house. After the novelty wore off, I realized i had heard it all before. Many of the cuts used tracks from the previously released ""Anthologies"", so there was really nothing new. It is interesting to listen to another person's opinion on how the wealth of the Beatle's catalogue could be remixed, but it may only make real artistic sense if you also see the Cirque de Solier performance."
3,If you're buying this for the surround sound...,"Jump straight to track 5 and use that to adjust your settings. Keep the treble low (you'll see why when you reach track 15). When you're ready to sit back and listen, start with track 9, and you will enjoy a wonderful experience. Believe me, if you let track 2 play on your first run-through, it may ruin the entire thing for you. Giles Martin is no Elliot Scheiner/Brian May/Mickey Hart when it comes to surround audio. His peaks are too high and many songs near the beginning have WAY too much treble.Enjoy"
2,Yawn,"It's a big yawner. Anybody with a reasonably respectable Beatles MP3 collection and a $40 computer program (Goldwave) could have created this album. There is frankly nothing new or imaginative. Not only that, the remixes detract from the originals. This music would likely work well in the context of the show, but fails to stand on its own as an album. All the hype is nothing more than yet another McCartney/Ono Christmas money grab."
4,A Lot of Fun,"This isn't something I'll pull out and listen to on a regular basis, but I must say that it was quite fun and very interesting to listen to the first time, and I'm sure it'll get played occasionally in the future. Unlike some of the reviewers here, I didn't have ANY expectations before buying it. I knew it could be uninspired and boring or it could be imaginative, fresh, and captivating. I must say I believe that most of the CD falls into the latter category. Some parts come off as brilliant, others uninspired. The first 5 songs were worth the money I spent. The rest is gravy.The real news here is the sound; I hope this is a preview of what we can look forward to when the entire Beatles catalog is remastered, and this also gives support to the argument that every album should be remixed, faithfully duplicating the original. This disc demonstrates that the original multi-tracks were recorded exceptionally well, and the finished product benefits greatly from modern mixing."
2,Music OK But Second Disc is Blank,The first CD set I received had a blank 2nd disc. I sent it back for replacement and the 2nd disc on the replacement is also blank. Obviously a bad batch. Amazon isn't going to replace this one for me but will issue a credit.
3,Interesting concept...,"... but this work is more of a reflection of the Martin's abilities to rework Beatles music than it is of the Beatles themselves.The artists on this release should be Sir George and Giles Martin, not the Beatles.This is akin to the Let It Be album, which (sadly)is more reflective of Phil Spector's producing abilities than of the Beatles' music. Thank the powers-that-be that the ""naked"" version was released a few years ago so it could be heard how it was meant to be heard."
1,WARNING! Beatles' purists do not buy this CD.,"I had to give this CD 1 star because the Amazon rating system would not accept a zero star rating. By looking at the album cover I thought I was buying a new release of Beatles music like the ""One"" CD. This CD is some pretentious idiots' idea of art, to mess up the Beatle's music. In fact the insert contains boastings of these self proclaimed artists. Don't waste your money."
5,Beatle's brilliance lives,"""Love"", the newly released Beatles' album is a metamorphosis of the Beatles' treasured and familiar sounds into an exciting living experience. A Beatles enthusiast listens on tender hooks, constantly anticipating being swept in a different direction or being immersed in new but strangely recognizable layers. Sir George and Giles Martin, George's son, blend and mix original Beatles' recording material with meticulous care. The project has been executed with the brilliance one would expect from this talented family."
5,Can't Stop Listening,Any Beatle fan will LOVE this. George Martin is a genius. I have been listening to it over and over again. The way he combines some of the songs is awesome.
3,frustrating,"I would like to give this toy five stars. It's a nicely made toy and my 2-year-old loves that she has a Woody that can talk. The lack of stars is for the *$#@ hat. This thing will NOT stay on Woody's head. I have found one angle where it will kind of stay on for about a minute, but every time my kid tries to play with this doll we spend 2/3 of our time going ""uh oh Mommy! Woody's hat! FIX IT!"" I am about ready to chuck the freakin hat in the garbage and tell my kid we lost it. If they had made some way for it to snap on, or even just given it some kind of chin strap thing, it would be so much better.Also - and this is not a huge issue, just vaguely disappointing - this Woody doesn't have all the same phrases as movie Woody."
5,Durable,Only beef is of course the weird voice and the hat that almost never stays on and his bandana is pink instead of red.But those pale to the fact that this toy survived a bubble bath unscathed. The electronic music box was very simple to dismantle for it to dry properly and the fabric dried just fine after a night of hanging. So I'm not going to sweat it if my toddler spills a drink on it or gets it dirty since it will survive cleaning.
1,Defective toy,"This was the WORST of all the amazon Christmas gifts that we had chosen!With an autistic NON-VERBAL son;...""TALKING WOODY"" has been his FAVORITE ever sine he saw the movie!!!(*WHICH HE HAS NOW SEEN HUNDREDS OF TIMES SINCE!!*)When he opened it;...his facial expression was absolutely PRICELESS with excitement!!!!......and when he pulled the string to hear him talk;.....IT WAS ASTONISHING!!!!....(to say the least!!!)HOWEVER;....less than 24 HOURS.......THE STRING CAME OUT......WOODY DIED!!!!:(----He was heart-broken!!!I DO WANT TO FIND HIM ANOTHER ONE....BUT HAVE NOT AS OF YET!I MUST SAY, THOUGH, THAT ***AMAZON***~~MADE GOOD ON THEIR PRODUCT POLICIES AND GAVE A FULL REFUND FOR THE DEFECTIVE TOY!!!....HOORAY FOR A QUALITY-ASSURED COMPANY!!NO DOUBT AT ALL THAT **AMAZON**~~WILL BE IN BUSINESS FOR A VERRY VERY LONG TIME AS LONG AS THEIR CUSTOMER'S SATISFACTION REMAINS #1 PRIORITY AS I HAVE PERSONALLY WITNESSED!Thanks to all and HAVE A SUPER-prosperous New year!!Ms. T. Lance"
2,Not worth the money paid,This is a cute toy however I wish I would have listened to the other reviews because a day after we had him he stoped talking. He now just spits a word or two out. The string does not work right and if you pick him up sometimes he will say a word or two. NOT worth your money at all.
1,worst toy ever,"i ordered this toy as a Christmas gift for my 2 year old son, the description on the web site stated that it was a ""pull string woody doll"" that talked.I paid $ 38 for it and when this item arrived in the mail it was a cheap,plush stuffed woody with NO pull string.I now have to refund this toy and wait 4 weeks for my money back.what a rip off!!!!!!"
4,Made a little girl happy,Woody was purchased for my granddaughter. She loved it. We had alot of trouble getting it out of the box and the box looked like it had been around the moon and back however the doll was ok.
5,Genial,Es como ver al propio woody de la pelicula. Muy bien hecho y duradero!! A mi bebe de 3 años le gusto mucho!
3,Woody has been decapitated :(,"We received both Woody and Buzz as a hand-me-down during a play date. They were both in great condition but within weeks, if not days, Woody's head snapped off and parts were exposed. I looked at having it repaired but no one feels like the plastic could be adequately glued back together. I am glad I did not purchase these. I am not sure if the issue is that perhaps 2 is too young for this type of toy; Buzz has lost part of his clear helmet cover and the wing cover is easily popped off. I replaced both with a plush version that came with a blanket at Wal-Mart over Christmas. May be OK for an older child."
4,Woody,"My little one loves ""buzz woody""... he cant get enough of the movie. This toy was a surprise for him amd he loves it. Woody is so sweet and the pull string is so retro! Note that woodys toy voice is not tom hanks' voice so dont be disappointed when woody starts talking...little ones dont know the difference anyway! ;)"
3,Not Durable!,"My son loves Toy Story. He wants all of these characters but since they are so expensive we had to buy them one at a time, slowly. Woody first, then we got Jesse... Both heads have fallen off, my son was pretty upset. We thought woody was just a fluke but only had Jesse for one month before her head came loose. Woody's pull string stopped working pretty quickly, im guessing jesse's will stop soon too. These toys are WAY too expensive to fall apart like this! My son want Buzz but i do not see that happening, Not wasting that much money for a toy that will break in a month...."
5,grandson loved it,"bought this for my grandson over a year or so ago & he loved it. It has also help up to his rough treatment of it, so product is made very well."
4,"Very good book, but not my favorite","The Blue Door was a very good book, with great characters, but it was my least favorite of the trilogy. It seemed to me to be slower and I thought the characters were a little better developed in A Stitch in time and broken days. Still if you read the other ones this book is well worth your time! It does wrap up the trilogy very nicely."
1,The worst book I have ever read in my entire life,"I hated this book. It had no plot, what passed for a plot was totally unbelievable. There was no way that the girl would be in that kind of situation. It made no sense at all and was very badly written. If you want to read a book, read something by a good author, like Chrichton. I wouldn't even give this book a star if I didn't have to."
2,Boring business book,This book was relatively boring compared to many other business books. To much detail was given to mundane topics. Not a mentally stimulating book by any means.
4,Very good,"If you watched the first season and enjoyed it, you will enjoy this album. If you loved the first season you will love this album. I was brought to tears by some of these tracks on first listen when I was reminded of the scenes from the series.That said many tracks on the album work mostly as filler. The score on the series is meant to fade into the background in parts, which works well for television but not as well for an album. While this soundtrack isn't as bad for fading into the background as the miniseries soundtrack, that is still true in parts. However, there are enough good tracks to justify purchasing this album, especially if you want to support the continuation of the series."
5,the first review/kagemusha,"well, this is the first time for a review, and i was recomended to this review. so here it goes.First of all wow!!! i mean wooowwhat a score, Bear McCreary did a hell of a job on this project.Its like a mix of all kinds of composers , like Harry Gregson Williams( from Man on Fire), Halo lot of cue`s, i could go on, and ofcause a danish group called Safri Duo.If anyone of your guys and girls like this kind of sumption , then buy it now."
5,Some VERY good music here,"""Passacaglia"" is one of the finest songs I think I have every heard. Ranks up there with Moonlight Sonata and Pachelbel's Canon in D.The UK version of the main title has got to be one of the finest bits of human vocals ever recorded.""The Shape of Things to Come"" is also a very nice song.Worth every penny."
3,good for the price,definitely not the best intro to newton mechanics but if you already know it and need the info in a new prespective this book will do you.NOT A SELF STUDY GUIDE.Is best when used as a review.
3,terry?,"i'm not sure how good or bad the music is,i only know that the great terry reid has nothing to do with it."
2,Pretty to look at but not much else.,"A romance set in 17th century England should be irresistable to me; especially one with such gorgeous costumes and scenery as this. However, this movie not only suffers from an insipid, silly storyline but from bad dialog as well. All you have to do is watch the very first scene of the movie for a shining example of truly awful dialog. I read Barbara Cartland novels when I was in my early to mid-teens and the story reminds me of some of the romantic tales my gal pal and I would cook up just for fun. Even so, I will give the movie two stars for its beautiful and mostly accurate costumes, especially the women's. It is also nice but rather surprising to see revered veteran actors like John Mills, Robert Morley and Gordon Jackson playing smaller roles in the movie.Unfortunately the video tape quality is awful and was almost unwatchable in the beginning. Luckily the tape was a gift and I didn't spend a dime on it!"
5,only one design flaw,"This scrabble board is great. Be warned, however, that there are so many extra squares and tiles that if you only play with two people, your game will take hours. The only problem I have with the board is trying to clear it at the end of the game. Normally you can just fold the board and pour the letters into the bag but this board has a split in the middle and the grid to keep the letters from sliding. With a little creativity, we were able to figure out a clean-up method without losing too many tiles to the floor. Also, there is no timer included with this edition which would have been a nice addition."
1,not the real scrabble,"This was a mistake. I thought I was buying regular scrabble with the rotating board, which my daughter has always wanted. I have a set like this and she always comments about how nice it is when we play. When she opened it to play, she found it was some other version of the game and was very disappointed. Now she must go through the hassle of returning it by January 31 to get the delux real scrabble. I will never make a purchase like this online again.Claire Quaglieri"
2,Disappointed,"I am very disappointed in this product for the money! I thought by the info that I was getting a scrabble board on a lazy suzanne type turn table ( like my friend's). Instead, the board is thin, folds in half and comes apart every time it is folded, and is difficult to turn! I would have taken it back if I had not purchased it on Amazon.com! Help!Very Disappointed"
1,Returning this today!,"I was very disappointed with the Super Scrabble. I had hoped to find a Deluxe version that I had several years but this was the closest I could find. The description states it can be rotated around which I thought would be like the old deluxe version on a lazy susan. Not so. We had to slide this around on little ""ball baring"" feet which wasn't very helpful. Also, we began a game and wanted to continue it later. I went to pick up the board and it came apart at the middle seem where it was assembled. The only part that was okay are the plastic separators to help keep the tiles organized on the board. This was a gift for an elderly parent and it was frustrating for me! I am returning it today."
1,Jipped! Did not get what I ordered!,"Ordering this was a waste of my time, got my hopes up, and nearly ruined Christmas. I did not receive the product that was advertised. Would give the review zero stars if it was possible."
2,not quality expected,Looked around for nice scrabble games with the interlocking tiles. Thought this one looked good and appeared to be high quality but when received it was cheap plastic tiles. Very disappointed.
2,not so good,This game is not very good board was connected in middle with hinges and was not even. the middle row of letters tilted. Would rather have a board in one piece.
5,WOW What a Great Book!!!!!!!!,"This is a great book. If you are looking for a great book for healers or just a book that is not only easy and fun to read, But that will teach you a few trick to working on your self and other. It is amazing all the things you can get out of such a small book. Its like people always say great things come in small packages. ... It was easy to read and follow. I have use the technique and I have found them to work well in my every day life. . I have recommended it to all of my friends and they too have loved it."
3,nature film,if your into nature films it is not a bad movie lots of pretty scenery and animals to see how they live
5,Very good job!,This dvd shows the wildlife in Africa's Rift Valley. I found it very informative and entertaining. The videography is fantastic. This dvd is a nice one to watch over and over again.
3,Not bad for the price...,"I expected better than I got, but the bench isn't all bad. Assembly was less intuitive than it should have been. The bench is not as sturdy as it might look."
3,Easy to humidity,I use this product about 2 years. The product is good but the lastest I bought they change lid packaging it is easy to get humidity I don't like it.
5,Best of them All,"Mya is a very inspiring artist.She's a wonderful singer,she's very beautiful,and seems like a woman with good attitude.The lyrics to her new album ""Fear of Flying""just had my whole mind because it seems I've been through simular things.I'm feeling it a lot.Mya's new album,I think should hit the top of the charts because honestly,this is the first cd I've ever listend to the whole way through.The whole cd is bomb.It's so good to me and my friends we all went out and bought like 10 cd's all together.It deserves 5 stars."
3,Mya : the singles seem to be her only strong moments,"Nice and solid work. ""Case of the ex"" is the only song that's a real hit though. Ireally like that song. The rhytm and everything just fits. The other tracksare rather mellow. Mya doesn't have a strong soul voice, but it's ok tolisten to her. Her songs feature Jadakiss and Lisa Lopes."
3,"Good, but with too many ballads get Moodring",All the slow ballad songs should have been replaced with uptempo songs this would have made a huge difference. the upbeat songs are:FreeLie Detector/Beenie ManRide@ShakeThats why i wanna fight youCase of the exMOODRING IS SO MUCH BETTER TRUST METhe best of meTakin me over is a good song too
3,Bland.,"Mya is a mediocre vocalist. We all know that. This CD is okay, which is all we can expect from her. Even Swizz Beats couldn't save her (though he did make some good beats).I got a second edition of this CD that included Free & this song called Again & Again, which in my opinion, along with Ride & Shake and Lie Detector, are the only good songs on the CD.so i would only reccommend this CD if you got the version i have with the extra songs on it. Otherwise, save your money."
1,Is This A Joke?!?!?!,It has to be. Everyone laugh. hahahahahahahahahaha. Laughable. What is This? A weak attempt to crossover to the mainstream even though she was already there. This is what you call a sell out album. Temptation of Fame made her sellout her substance for style. Nothing Much else To Say.........I dont know what to tell ya. Best Of Me with Jadakiss is pretty hot though. Besides that it's kinda eh blase' Nothing else even worth mentioning on this cd. Oh yeah the production really brings out the weakness in her voice. It Was weak before but now it is really noticeable and it sounds horrible. Please dont buy this and dont even dub it. Warning Has Been Issued!
3,Highs and Lows,"This is a pretty good R&B/pop CD. Mya's voice is kind of flat, but the catchy hip-hop beats and fun lyrics keep the songs alive. The top 3 songs are ""Case Of The Ex"", ""How You Gonna Tell Me"" and ""Pussycats."" The ballad ""Fear Of Flying"" is also a nice slow jam. Overall a worthy purchase, but beware there are flat out stinkers on here, namely ""Ride & Shake"" and ""No More Tears On My Pillow."" I also recommend Pink's amazing ""Can't Take Me Home"" for great R&B/pop/hip-hop."
3,Love Mya's Voice...,"I have a ton of R/B CD's from the 90's in my collection and although all of the artists can sing, I think they do sound alike. However, Mya's voice stands out with it's extra sweet and sticky sound...I love it! Not all the songs on this CD are gems, but the stand outs are ""The Case of the Ex,"" ""Pussycats,"" and ""Takin' Me Over."""
5,Great Album,Perhaps Jethro Tull's best work ever. Thick As A Brick is the full package. The polyphonic musical textures create a canvas on which the poetic lyrics unfold. This album is great to listen to again and again... and is a must have for anyone who enjoyes well written music. This cd provides a thematic journey into the realm of Jethro Tull.
3,Good but not grate,"I brought this CD because a friend recommended it. This is a good example of progressive rock, but actually the style is repetitive. If this is your first CD on Jethro I would recommend it, but if you already have aqualang, stay there."
5,A prog-rock masterpiece.,"I had my doubts about TAAB initially, but I still wanted to hear it. Now that I have, I realized that nobody does stuff like this anymore, and that needs to change.For those who've never heard of it, Thick As a Brick is an entire album devoted to one song, entitled Thick As a Brick. It's a long, rambling piece with some impossibly dense lyrics, the first side being by far the best, especially those first three minutes or so. The lyrics are great, rivalling Bob Dylan in delivery and crypticness (is that a word?) And the musicianship is, as we'd expect from the group, top-notch.The second side is a bit weaker than the first, but still strong. You should own this record."
4,Access complex,This focused blue collar epic is the rare progressive rock offering which is always tautly arranged without being overly cerebral.
2,OK RECORD but inferior to earlier works,"I dunno. I can't believe that people give THIS LP five stars and ""This Was"" - Tulls much superior first LP 4 and even more dreadful 3 stars. There is no accounting for bad taste. Tulls' first LP and then the following two - Stand Up and Benefit are BOTH better than Thick As a Brick which was overblown and muddled.I can only guess that most of the latter fans came along... well LATER and never heard This Was until they because accustomed to stuff like YES Tales of Topographic Oceans and who knows - Innagadda Da Vida? Mindnumbing. . Anyway Brick is OK... But 5 stars?? NUTS. But THIS WAS instead. And then pick up Stand Up and Benefit. Hell even Aqualung is better than Thick as a Brick."
5,Tull's best just got better,"Tull's best album and the interviews at the end are very interesting, espesially when Jeffery Hammond-Hammond says a lot of these recordings were first rehearsed then recorded in 1 take!

5,Music That Will Enrich Your Soul,"What to call Morrie Louden? Artist/Master Bassist/Master Composer? MONSTER/Musician? All of it, and more. You won't use Time Piece for background music; you can bet on that. You'll sit down to listen... and feel... with your eyes closed---and you'll go on a most fantastic musical journey. There are no ""throw-away tunes"" on this CD. Each one takes you to a different part of your self---your core---that you didn't know existed. Yes---speed--incredible ACCURATE speed... You want unbridled musical playfulness? You want poignancy? You got it! {:+} Yes; Morrie Louden is a gifted artist. This music won't remind you of any other music you've heard. I guess I'll call it ""potato chip music""; there's no way in the world to listen to this CD just once, at the first sitting. You'll listen again... and again, to all of it---and come away so much richer for the incredible experience. Morrie Louden---your music and your playing are gifts to the universe. Many thanks.Kharyn Leigh"
5,Land of Cockayne,"The Last Album they made but by no means the least, this remastered version certainly does it justice, buy this one if you love saxaphones."
1,Even Elevators Might Avoid This,"I am second to none in my admiration for the Soft Machine, but THIS CD is not the Soft Machine. To be sure, it bears the name of that group, but absolutely none of the original members appears on it. And few if any of the secondary or tertiary members appear on it. Was this recording made to fulfill a contract? Or did someone think (as they often do) that the world needs more bland, mediocre music -- and market it under a respected name? Even the presence of the estimable Jack Bruce fails to save this. And (if memory serves; the CD has long since gone into the discards in the cellar) even the ever-tedious Karl Jenkins took a pass on this one."
2,A bit dissappointed,"When I purchased the item, it stated that the arrival date would be on or around Dec 24th. I had to send a email for the product to be shipped or else cancel the order. I received it within a week (but no tracking number was provided) & the bottles were well packaged. After removing the contents I noticed that one of the applicators was missing. I sent an email explaining the situation & also provided a picture. I received an email stating that it was ""noted"" and nothing more. I sent two additional emails asking when the replacement item will be sent & I received no response. I will never purchase from this company again!"
5,perfume bottles,These are very beautiful. They are the right size. The set is very good. Thank you very much. Hope you enjoy it to.
2,Case knife,"Knife was not sharpened properly, 2 blades were over ground and not honed properly. Not the quality Case is known for. No problems with Amazon whatsoever."
4,"5 star for the price, 4 all in all.","This card does what i want it to do which is power a small pc and it does it very well (win xp, intel 4 2.8ghz, 2 gig mem)."
2,An academic critique - with all the academic faults,"Tylor Monroe (below) is a little harsh - but not very. This book is an academic critique of Wolfe's masterpiece, and like a lot of contemporary academic literary criticism, cannot get out of its own way. Lots of theory, lots of jargon, little illumination of the work for the average reader. This is the sort of book which gets on the author's resume, counts toward his publication list for tenure - and is immediately forgotten!I do not want to say that that all of his ideas are worthless; just that they are very hard to extract from the jargon, and may not be worth the effort."
2,DELTA-NA ABLATE-IS,"DELTA/LASERLIGHT sinks to new lows with this odd SANTANA album.The later-career version of ""Persuasion"" here is lame-- it doesn't have the fire of that first COLUMBIA LP's track. The title cut, ""Evil Ways"" is bootleg-quality live material. The rest on this one is forgettable.NOT recommended. (1 jingos)"
4,Not perfect but acceptable,This was purchased as a gift for my 29 year old son. I am not a musician so I can't comment on how the guitar plays. It arrived with some of the finish marred on the neck. The tuner was unusable. Something about not being able to open it to put the batteries in. Other than that he is very happy. Sound is good. He says he dosen't need the tuner and the bad finish is small and not worth sending back.
4,Worthwhile,Better than I expected. Anthropology of a rare slice of humanity. The main subjects are presented in fascinating complexity and nuance.
2,Boring film about stupid people,"Why waste your time watching two hours of candid camera in the lives of shallow, clueless people who can't figure out that their massive fortune is gone and they need to adjust to their new reality."
4,Revealing chronicle of life in the 1%,"The expression ""All that glitters is not gold"", could not be more appropriate for the life that the Seagals lived. It's intriguing that among the host of characters we meet in this documentary, the 14-year-old adopted daughter is the one that emerges as having the most balanced perspective."
2,"Oh, the poor, poor rich people","These are about the most pathetic human beings I have ever come across and watching this was an agony of entitlement, self congratulations, arrogance and greed. It is agonizing. If you enjoy watching the scum of the earth, you will not be disappointed. If your taste in entertainment rises a little above that, do yourself and watch something else. Anything else. Or go clean the litter box. You'll be dealing with the same thing as this movie."
4,Good Movie,"It is a funny, good acting, well written and produced but true story of Riches to Rags story of a Las Vegas builder."
2,Two Hours with People I Didn't Like,"Once I was subjected to a time-share sales presentation. I suffered through the hard sell and manipulative sales tactics to get a gift, which was a paid hotel stay in San Francisco. The only problem was that the hotel stay had so many restrictions that I never used it. So after watching this movie and seeing David Siegal, the architect of my suffering, lose his money, I had no sympathy for him. I feel some sympathy for his wife and children. I think they are simply unprepared for life in the real world.I didn't enjoy the movie because I didn't like the people who are its subjects and didn't like spending two hours with them. This has nothing to do with the talent of the film maker."
2,Warning: G4 owners read this!,"Hello,I bought this and tried to use it on a Powerbook G4 with 512 ram. The eyetv200 did work, but not well. The video is choppy and grainy. Other problems include that it locks up often, and you have to unplug the unit from the computer and restart it. It wouldn't wake the computer from sleep to record a tv show, like it is supposed to. The other problem is that the tv listing the software uses, is not accurate. It had incorrect times for shows. I reported this and they admited it, and said they contracted the listing with another company. Most importantly there is NO phone contact provided with Elgato. They refuse to provide it. You have to email them with problems, and they email you back.....Days later. They say it will work on anything G3 500 or higher. I strongly disagree! This company needs to provide phone contact and improve their product before anyone should buy it. Great idea, Poor product."
4,A really good live acoustic performance from Donovan,"Found in a second-hand CD store, this is an extremely well made album that contains some nice folk songs. Especially, ""Jennifer Juniper"", ""Atlantis"", ""Catch the wind"" and Buffy Sainte-Marie's ""Universal Soldier"" are great. We can really consider Donovan the British invasion's answer to the uncatchable Bob Dylan."
2,"Very disappointing, and dangerous","The book not only provides scant and outdated information, some of it is erroneous, and quite a part of it harmful. I am quoting the ones I can remember: amazons, like all parrots, do NOT need to be fed grit; not only cherry, but a lot of other types of fruit tree wood are poisonous to parrots, including apple and apricot; acorns and celery are both harmful to parrots, and should not be fed to them. All in all, this is a guide to quickly and painfully disposing of your pet, and ought to be avoided. I don't give it one star mainly because it has some pretty pictures."
4,DiAnno keeps it going,Well Paul DiAnno is one of the greatest singers in the world. He has a pure golden metal voice and these tracks are good with a never stopping going... Allthough the reason for missing one star is that Dennis Stratton sings too much... Hes good too but he is in too good company for him. But this album is still worth to buy. Its a very good album with very good songs.
4,Predictable Coming of Age Tale,"Life for Kyreol has always been simple and easy on the River, which begins at the Face and ends in the rainbows of Fourteen Falls. Her people lead a simple harmonious life of fishing and swimming. Kyreol, with her inquisitive nature and her missing mother, is thought very eccentric by her tribe.During the annual Moon-Flash ceremony which marks Kyreol's betrothal, she sees a stranger in the crowd. Insatiable curiosity and feelings of being trapped by her future husband's family lead Kyreol to steal away in a boat with her childhood friend Terje to find out what, if anything, lies beyond Fourteen Falls.McKillip's writing is as excellent as ever, and while this is a fine coming of age tale, I found it more than a bit predictable and felt unsatisfied when I turned the last page. Perhaps reading the sequel would help."
4,Fun & Easy!,"My daughter used these crowns as part of her halloween costume. She enjoyed decorating the crowns, but the crown kept slipping off of her head while trick-or-treating. But maybe we just tied it on incorrectly. I'd buy again if the occasion arose."
5,"Still influential, still one of the best","There's little else I can add to the already many 5-star comments here. It is a great, and at times nostalgic look at the life and times of this great artist. Enjoyed it from start to finish.Only a few criticisms (things that could be easily fixed in a future edition, I hope): (1) The video quality might've been better, especially in this age of HD screens; (2) a single, over-arching narrator to tie everything in would've been a nice touch; and (3) Frazetta's biographer should've delivered his lines more organically instead of sounding so dramatically over the top... but none is a deal breaker to me. The good overweighs the bad by a lot. It is a vignette: a work of love by fans, artists, friends, and family, pure and simple, not an aseptic History channel ""documentary,"" and as such it works very well."
4,"Gentle People, The - Mix Gently","Mix Gently is the Japanese companion album for the The Gentle People's Soundtracks for Living. Though it features remixes from Rephlex stablemates DMX Krew and Global Goon (who turns ""Laurie's Theme"" into some weirdo IDM), the majority of mixes on here are unique to this release. DJ Force, for instance, jettisons the lazy afternoon vibe, and makes ""The Soundtrack of Life"" a slightly darker tech-step track. The Karminsky Experience take ""Travel Bug"" to a completely different place, while Yoshinori Sunahara keeps his version of ""Emotion Heater"" very close to the original. Kindred spirit Fantastic Plastic Machine makes ""The Soundtrack of Life"" into a soundtrack for the disco life. An good collection that complements the original nicely."
2,support is not good.,Just ordered the Cendyne as referred by cnet.com. Speed seems good but customer support is bad. Product was missing software and for some strange reason it had a MS Small Business Edition cd already loaded in the drive? So either I was sent a return or this cd was in there from the manufacturer. Submitted a trouble ticket with their support inquiring about the missing software and the only reply i got so far was 'please register your product' which i did immediatley but so far 2 weeks have gone by without any reply.
3,Junie b jones and a monkey problem,I like this book because it is cool. It made me think about a lot of things like when I first had a baby brother or sister. I say like wow Iam going to have a little baby brother you say how can Iam going to help that baby. All he does is cry they are people or kids that dont want to have a baby brother because your mother told you to baby sit him and you dont want to do it. And the thing that I didnt like this book is that you say bad things to your baby brother and you heart the feelings of your little brother.
5,Very Funny Book!,"I think this book is very funny. Cause' Junie B. Jones uses weird words. I think this book deserves 5 stars, for a well writen and funny book. I recomend this book to kids from 6 to 10."
1,Obvious Grammatical Errors,"I just finished reading this to my first-grader. In addition to a lot of fragmented sentences (which I can almost understand). Why are words spelled like runned and spended (instead of ran and spent)? Have they no editors that review these at all. Also, Junie B seems to be more foul-mothed than most first graders that I've seen."
4,little monkey business,When junie B. found out that her mom is having a baby she gets mad and starts making people mad.The only time she was is she gets to go to the store and pick out wall papper for the baby. If my mom was having a baby I would be pretty mad to because she would spend all the time with the baby.I like this book because it was funny.I think this is a good book for kids who are mad about their mom who are having a baby and making jokes about it.
5,Monkey Business Mix-up,"Monkey Business is another great children's book written by Barbara Park. Junie B is going to be getting a new baby brother. She isn't so sure it will be fun until her grandma tells her that her baby brother was born and that he's a cute little monkey. That's when all of Junie B.'s troubles began. She went into school telling everyone that her baby brother was a real live monkey. Kindergarteners, being the literal people that they are, don't always understand we don't mean an actual monkey. This causes mayhem for her and her classmates.Junie B. Jones is a must read for all beginning readers. Junie B. Jones and a Little Monkey Business is one that should be top on your list to read. It will make you and your child laugh out loud.By Kerri J. BusteedAuthor of Will's First HuntWill's First Hunt"
2,hh,"Vendor was prompt and professional.Item was clean and good value.Stultifying, slow moving, could not finish this tome.Not the Faulks that I know and love."
5,Relative of a victim,"I have read this book several times since it was first released. It is very hard for me to read or watch anything about Ted Bundy since my cousin was his last victim. I would recommend this book to anyone that has ever heard of Ted Bundy. It is scary to think that this kind of thing can happen anywhere, anytime. Ann Rule shows you how you think you know someone but really not know them at all. Even though Bundy finally met his match, it's sad to think we will never know how many victims there really were and what kind of pain and horror they might have suffered. Too bad Bundy's life ended so quickly!"
5,Couldn't put it down.,"This is the first book I have read by Ann Rule. While I was not alive during the Bundy murders, his case has always fascinated me. This book is very well written and Ms. Rule does a great job of taking the reader back in time. I will certainly be reading more of Ann Rule's books."
1,Ann Rule Got Lucky,"Ann Rule got lucky with this one in that she just happened to be associated with Ted Bundy when they worked together at a crisis clinic. If not for Bundy, Ann Rule would have gone nowhere as a writer. She has no sense of imagination or pace, and her books are always BORING! If you want to read a really great true crime author, read anything by Jack Olsen, may he rest in peace."
5,There are actually monsters out there like this!,"I found the book to get a little slow at times because of the legal storyline, but still a strong five star read. This book really kept me going. If your reading this review and have an interest in people who do terrible acts of violence to other human beings, then I recomend this book. There are actually people out there like Ted Bundy - a true human monster. Scary!"
4,Scary!,"Bundy was an intelligent, good-looking, yet COLD-HEARTED, VICIOUS M U R D E R E R. I think that Bundy was a very evil and sick man - I don't believe at all that the fact that he was a ""bastard"" made him go out and kill young, beautiful women. Not that the author implied that, but I got the feeling that some people would use that as a ""motive"". And to the girls who wrote love letters to him while he was in jail, ""You're stupid."" Whoever believes in Bundy's innocence after reading this book (or knowing the facts and having seen the evidence) has got to be living in a different world. Too sad, though, that the disappearance of that little girl who lived on his street when he was a young boy has never been solved. Frankly, Bundy deserved to be executed - it's just too bad that so much money was spent on his defense and appeals before he was actually put to death."
2,The next book might be more interesting.......,I felt as if this book was going in several directions and didn't know where to wind up. The tragedies were very forced and almost predictable. However the story plot for the next book Girl in the Shadows seems promising.
3,Suitable for most purposes,"I was a mac user from years back, and was surprised when I found out my new Mac mini didn't have an sudio in... I was planning on turning some casette tapes into MP3 files.While it was usable for this purpose, it has a small noticable mid-range hum. This was not from my casette deck, as the hum is consistent no matter what kind of input I use, from casette to a small powered microphone from Radio Shack. It might be suitable for some podcasting, audio blogging, etc., it would NOT be usable for audio input into something like Garage Band... there are higher end products for that."
5,Plug-and-Play Mic Input,"I originally picked up the iMic so that I could use a microphone headset with my G5. It has worked perfectly since. It was simply plug-and-play for me, no fuss, no muss. It looks like it's more expensive now than when I purchased it, but at the time, it was a fairly inexpensive way to get decent mic functionality on a Mac.It does also work on a PC, though I haven't really done much experimentation with it. I'd definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a way to get a mic to work with a computer that doesn't have a built-in mic port."
1,False advertisement,"The box said this product works with PCs, but it didn't. I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you have a Mac."
4,Griffin Technology iMic USB External Sound Card,Great for mac users that have a quicksilver mac. Works great.
4,Watch the price on this item,"Amazon ran this item for $3.60, including super saver shipping, about two weeks ago, and it is so worth it. I already have the Lenox cardinal Winter greetings mug, and this saucer goes very well with it. The workmanship on this china is impeccable. Put this in your Save for Later section of your cart and watch for it to go on sale again."
3,Call it Courage,If you like hard and adventures stories then you should read this book but I rate it at a 3 because this book is a little to hard and it has Eaters-of-men and I think that it is a little strange.
1,Call it Courage,"I had the hardest time getting through this book. Even though it was a very short book it was way hard to read and it was WAY BORING!!! I absolutly hated it!!!! It was about a young boy named Mafatu who lives on a island that worships courage. But Mafatu doesn't fit in, on this island because he has no courage. He is especially afarid of the sea because when he was very young his Mother was ""swallowed up by the Sea God."" Then one day he decides to prove himself to the island and goes off with his pet dog and pet bird to another island to show he can be brave and courageous."
4,Mafatu is a boy who proves he's not a wimp.,"Mafatu is a boy whose mom dies at sea and ever since he was scared.So he gets a canoe and goes into the Indian Ocean. He lands on a island and faces danger like killing a boar, killing a shark, and is chased by CANNIBALS!That's what I call courage."
3,if you like short books that are adventure READ THIS(>'.')>,Call it Courage is an adventures book about how a 12 year polynesian boy that through out the book conquers his fear of the sea wich swallowed his mother at a young age.
4,At My Son's Request,"This was a gift for his son. He's not much of a reader, but a very deep thinker. He likes facts and history. He's 12 going on 16 and I hope this will encourage his reading habit."
3,Enjoyed by 8 yr old,"The biggest shortcoming of this book is that it is too short. It glosses over long periods of time and so many of the things that Mafatu did that it leaves questions and holes in the story.The author does use the word ""blacks"" in a negative way, but ""eaters-of-men"" is not derogatory - there truly are/were cannibals on some Pacific islands.The ending is well done, leaving the reader unsure of Mafatu and Uri's survival."
4,One of the Most Exciting Books I've Ever Read,"Call it Courage by Armstrong Sperry is the story of a boy named Mafatu who was afraid of the sea. To prove his courage, he went on a journey to a foreign island (likely Tahiti), battling sharks and octopus to prove his worth. If you like suspense, this is the book for you. I only wish it could have been longer."
2,Potentially fascinating film ruined by a dull script,"SHOT IN THE HEART is based on the true story of murderer Gary Gilmore (well played buy Elias Koteas) who was the first prisoner to be sentenced to death in a decade. Set in the year 1977, the film revolves around the efforts of his younger brother Mikal (Giovanni Ribisi) to stop the execution, even against his brothers wishes; because Gilmore sees himself gaining permanent notoriety, he even has t-shirts with GILMORE printed on them. While well acted, the film's pace is rather stodgy and interesting only occasionally. That same year a punk song by The Adverts called GARY GILMORE'S EYES was released. The song is only a couple of minutes long. This movie is over 90 minutes. Download the song and try and find it in your heart to forgive screenwriter Frank Pugliese for making such a snoozer out of potentially interesting material. The film is based on the book by Mikal Gilmore."
5,Feeling Great!,"I but this just for what was said about it, and I have to admit, because a lot of MLB players use it, I figured, if they use it then it has to work, since I bought it and started wearing it I have not taken it off and my head, shoulders and neck feel great."
3,Pretty but no special effect,"This was a present for my sister-in-law, who specifically requested it, hoping that it would somehow give her energy. It hasn't, but she still thinks it's pretty."
5,Satisfied customer,The product was exactly as we expected and was shipped in a timely manner. No complaints.
3,This didn't make any difference,I thought this product was going to make a visible and evident difference in my performance (I play tennis). It did nothing for me.
1,Pseudoscience voodoo. Check wikipedia,"I can't believe there are so many gullible people out there. These necklaces don't actually do anything. Look up phiten and pseudoscience.Like David Hannum said, ""There's a sucker born every minute."""
3,the book has too many loose ends,"well this book was ok but it did not explain what happened to some of the characters like adelaide, jude miller, it just leaves you wondering about them.Some parts of the book does not seem to make sense at all and is hard to understand for an average reader.I have to write on one of the charaters so i chose sita tappe, i would like the help to know how i should go about it.it is an essay i am doing."
3,Disturbing book of a 40 year obsession.,"I have mixed feelings about this book. It probably arises from the fact that I had to read and do a report on it for a college course.It is not my kind of novel, but I give it a slightly passing mark anyway."
3,moderately amusing,Judy Tenuta's humor is like chocolate fudge. It's delightful in small quantities but nauseating if you binge on it. Ms. Tenuta is a one-act comedian whose one act cannot carry an entire book.
4,Good for 4th Year,"I found this book helpful during vet school, but it doesn't have enough detail to be that helpful after graduation."
4,Funny in an intellectual way,"I enjoyed this book. It's a quick read, it's funny, and it made me pause and think about life-the-universe-and-everything.This is not Dave Barry funny or Three Stooges funny. But it is funny."
4,Comfortable Fretless Bass Sound!,"I like fretless bass sound, Jaco, Mark Egan, Steve Bailey... I listened first to his bass-play at the Paco De Lucia's album. Then, I wanted to listening to his play more. I get it today and this album excited me! He plays bass like a Steve Bailey, and his spanish phrases are comfortable. I was surprised that he plays other stringed instruments very very well.If you like fretless bass sound, I advise you to listen to this album."
5,An all time classic folk music album,"Thank heavens this classic album by The Watersons is still in print in a decent quality CD. This is historically a key album in the 1960s British folk revival, and, historical considerations aside, is one of the finest, most joyous, and most listenable set of folk recordings ever made. Persons with a serious interest in the 1960s folk revival will certainly want this CD, as in fact will anyone who likes wonderful songs and wonderful singing."
4,A disappointment,"This is my eighth ""Body"" book. I've not been reading them in order, but until this book it hadn't mattered. My favorite so far is ""The Body in the Ivy"".I was disappointed in this book because I felt that the relationship between Faith and her husband wasn't that interesting. They didn't seem to communicate very well, but it didn't really have much to do with the mystery I expected.What attracted me to this author is that I also live in a small New England town and what goes on in one is just like she writes about Aleford. I've been in Boston a few times and love it there.I just couldn't get interested in this book and skipped to the end long before I sometimes do. The recipes look good, but that really isn't the reason one buys a mystery book.I haven't given up and will continue reading her."
2,Disappointing,"When I read her first book, _The Body in the Belfry_, I was delighted to believe I had found another mystery author I could enjoy. This was the next one I read (out of sequence, I know), and in the wake of her debut... so disappointing. The title is misleading, the pace is slow, the ending fails to satisfy. So much of the story seems like filler for an uninspired plot.Moreover, Faith evolves in this installment into a shallow character even as Page tries to make her dynamic. As a mother of 2 myself I was hoping to find a food snob who could juggle it all, but instead I met a mother whose primary objective seems to be to find other places for her children to be so that she can better indulge in reading a diary she finds and shares with the reader (more filler).I thought this was a strategy similar to moving Jessica Fletcher to teach on a city campus in NY, but Page departs from more than the village of Aleford."
3,Fascinating Story! Jerky writing!,"You must read this book for the excellent story as long as you discount some of the jerky writing which disrupts the flow of the story. The characters are described wonderfully but the descriptions of the ""statistical"" betting techniques are a bit overdone."
4,Great!,"This was a great book- I sped through its 240 pages in just 3 days. I didn't know anything about gambling, Vegas, or card counting before I picked up the book, but I couldn't put it down. Though other reviewers have complained that Mezrich didn't explicitly state that he changed the names and certain facts, come on. OBVIOUSLY, anyone would, and that's not a real criticism. And, alas, on the copyright page, he states that names and details were changed.And of course he makes ""embellishments""- if he told the story word for word as relayed to him, no one would be able to read it.It is a great read. Recommended for anyone!"
3,True identity of Kevin Lewis,The author changed all the names to protect the characters' true identities. Kevin Lewis was a name he used in the casinos. His real name is Jeffrey Ma born in 1972.
3,"Interesting, but......","I dont think Mr. Mezrich is a very good writer, but he has toldan interesting story. (Mr. Mezrich is without doubt a better writerthan me, just not terribly good among writers whose booksI've read, imho). I like playing blackjack, and I have an idea howhard it is to count cards in a casino setting. No, I can't do iteffectively, but I don't believe it changes the odds as dramaticallyin the player's favor as the book describes. Still, I enjoyed""Bringing Down the House"" as""partial fiction""."
4,A page-turner that doesn't teach you card tricks,"It's a Robin Hood-story of a group of math students from the MIT-ivory tower using their brains to get rich at Las Vegas giants' expenses. I must say it is truly a page turner and if you weren't interested in Blackjack before, you increase your chances of becoming. Looking back, the story is almost too cliché, but if you immerse yourself without skepticism, you'll will love it!Just a comment: the book does not make you better at Blackjack, I understand that Knock-Out Blackjack by Vancura & Fuchs is the one to turn to."
3,I get it,"This is an interesting story, but it would have been better as a feature article in a magazine, not a 257 page book. It was a ballsy thing for these geeks to do, but we didn't need to hear about every trip, and every close call. And where were the serious consequences besides getting banned from casinos, and audited by the IRS? I kept waiting for some real trouble for Kevin."
4,DOUBLE DOWN ON THIS BOOK!,Be prepared to lose some sleep after you open this book. It's the engrossing story of how a small band of MIT students managed to work as a team playing Blackjack and win $3 million plus from Casino's in Vegas. While the students did nothing illegal it becomes very obvious that the Casinos were less than amused with the student's success. The stories of what the Casinos did to try and stop the students ring true and may discourage a reader from learning how to count cards. Congrats to the students for using their smarts in an innovative way. Would have given the book five stars but the authors need to ingratiate himself into the story was annoying.
2,not the best on the subject,"This book was mostly fiction. The MIT students did succeed in counting cards successfully but the author embellished the story to the point of fiction in many cases. Nevertheless, it is fairly interesting as a light read although not very well-written. For a much more interesting look at card counting read another book called ""Striking It Rich: Golf in the Kingdom with Generals, Patients amd Pros"". I enjoyed this book immensely. It was written by an MIT grad who actually did the card counting and it shows. It is also about MIT and medicine (the guy is now a plastic surgeon) and golf (he is a pro golfer also) but the chapter on his former life as a card counter is fascinating and much more informative that BDTH."
4,"A good yarn, delivery could use some work.","Good story, made more compelling because it's true. The author is a tad melodramatic, though this false sense of tension isn't what kept me reading. The flaps and the intro tell you more or less how things are going to turn out."
2,This needed to have more umph to it,"Rhis book needed to have more umph, more dynamite suspense. more of a sense of 'will we get away with it' to it. No pictures also makes this book lacking. I wanted to see the people who pulled all these card counting routines off. Pictures of the eye in the sky cameras. Pictures of casino bosses."
5,Hit Me!,"This is a great story and the writing stands up to the quality of the story itself. It leads the reader through the rise and ultimate fall of a team that approaches Blackjack as if it were a sport that can be trained for and mastered rather than a game of chance. Absolutely great. Could have given greater perspective on those who developed the card counting methods that the MIT team built upon, but that's just a nit pick. Read this book if you have any affinity to playing games!"
5,Super good book and author,"Amazing story. The story is really cool; you may find yourself with a deck of cards counting Highs and Lows. Its been a while since I've picked up a book and had difficulties putting it down. The documentary on the Discovery Channel doesn't do the story any justice (an obviously a copy of the sucess of this book). If you know anything about Black Jack, you should really read this.Mezrich is really an amazing writer. Also read Merzrich's ""Ugly Americans"" (released after this book), especially if your interested in finance."
3,Decent Book,"It was a decent read but very much overhyped by a lot of people; this book was even recommended to me as amazing by someone I later discovered hadn't even read it! There's not nearly as much extravagance, action, or suspense one might expect considering the reviews. Of course real life isn't like Hollywood, but then to be fair it shouldn't be billed as such. In the end this book was mediocre in that I didn't feel affected in any way by it."
5,Great True Story!,I couldn't put this book down! Great story about a college kids smart enough to beat a system that's desiged to beat you. Highly recommend.Only downside is that it makes for quick reading.
3,Just a retread of Uston's book,"I wanted to like this book, but part way through it, I came to the conclusion that it was pure fiction. I think Mezerich took Ken Uston's ""Million Dollar Blackjack"" and just put another story behind that book. I sense slight plagiarism here. He even uses the same nicknames as Uston did, such as ""Big Player"" and ""Gorilla"".I thought that the writing was very jumbled. There were also many problems with facts. There is not a ""Plymouth PI agency"", it is the Griffin book that has all the pictures of the big counters and undesirables. More untruths was the ease of grabbing a drink off of the cocktail waitress's tray. That won't happen.I seriously don't think that any part of this book is true. A group of MIT students can certainly improve on Ken Uston's techniques, but they don't. They don't even use his more advanced counting techniques. Certainly a bunch of brainiacs can adeptly use them. That in itself is suspicious."
1,genius?,"As has already been pointed out by other reviewers,the numbers here just don't add up. A win rate anythingclose to what they boast should give a far greateroverall return. ""Boast"" being the operative word bythe way. The number of times we are told how smartthese people are is laughable. Let's examine the evidencefor this genius. They counted cards. So what? Anyonecan learn to do this in a few hours. This was inventedover thirty years ago. They played in teams. Again,a lot of people have done this. I believe this was alsodone in the seventies. They got caught. Not evidenceof great skill there. In fact, if they were not MITkids there would be absolutely zero evidence of any intelligenceabove average.seems like a case of a few college kids who happenedto know the author."
3,It's all true,"A previous review suggested that only 60% of the story is true. I chime in only to tell you unequivocally that the story is 100% true, although some things have been left out. How do I know? I was on the team a long time ago.I was surprised that they gave away as much information as they did, because I would think that some are still employing the system in a slightly altered form. If you're curious, because the list in the book stops at 18, the words for 20 and 21 were cigarettes (20 in a pack) and beer (the legal drinking age). I think it may have been a better read to embellish a little or to include some relevant non-blackjack stories involving the members, but as written it is all true."
5,Mesmerizing!,"This book is mesmerizing, I couldn't put it down. It reads like a spy novel. I hope they make it into a movie."
4,Great Behind-the-Scenes Look at Card Counting,"This book came to my attention after hearing a radio interview with one of the MIT Card Counters. I immediately searched out this book, and it didn't disappoint. Ben Mezrich does a great job of boiling down a sophisticated card-counting system, following the rise and fall of one of the team's key members. And for those interested in the details, an essay on card counting mechanics by the main subject, ""Kevin Lewis,"" is presented at the end of the book.This was Mezrich's first forray into non-fiction and it shows at times with some cheesy and tedious metaphors and heavy-handed attemps at injecting prose into the action. Nonetheless, the book is short enough and the action quick enough that I wouldn't describe this as a major distraction.If you liked ""Rounders"" or the casino scene in ""Rain Man,"" then this book is probably for you."
5,Set of 4 Tropical Art Prints Palm Trees Sailboats 8x10 Posters,These are the best posters I've ever bought. The pictures have ahigh quality. The posters really does worth to buy especially forsuch little price. I contacted the sealer with some other issueand they treat me very well.I love their work.Highly recommended!
1,"Love This Movie, but arrived damaged.","This is an excellent movie and shows a different side of Kareena Kapoor who usually plays a love struck bimbo. It is worth watching as it shows everyone has a background and maybe we should't judge each other the way we do.I was very excited to add this movie to my collection but, unfortunately the DVD arrived with the DVD lose, which I understand does occur with shipping. When I opened it the DVD had what appeared to be remnants of adhesive. I tried to clean, but it would not come off. Hoping the DVD would play I tried it and it skipped. Extremely disappointed."
5,Mega Faith Booster,"I can't say enough good things about Beth Moore.Great work, it brings your faith to a new level."
5,Lovin' it!,I just started reading the book and have already found myself being lead to a new place in Christ. The book is written in a format that will challenge any seasoned Christian while energizing and building up a new believer. Built on solid biblical truths it is the kind of work that accurately divides the word and encourages your spirit. I love it!
3,Listen I love these but,"are u kidding me, I have been begging my mom for my cchildhood back, cause I threw mine out carelessly when i was 7, now im 11 and want it back, but guess what Im not gonna get it cause I am defidently not gonna be allowed to buy 100 dollars on a diggit pet! PLEASE LOWER THE PRICE"
2,"Tastes great, but read the ingredients...","I picked up a box of this GoodEarth Caffeine Free Original tea at a discount store lately. I drank several cups. I was really impressed by the intensity of the flavor. How could it be so sweet with no sugar? If you look at the packaging it ""looks"" natural and healthy, but then read the ingredients - number three is ""ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR."" Considering that the order of the ingredient listing indicates relative percentage of contents, a significant portion of this tea is ""Artifical Flavor."" Which means what? What the heck is it made of? Who knows - this stuff is getting tossed in the trash and I'll never trust GoodEarth again. By the way, this is manufactured by Tata Enterprises out of India - you might want to do some research about them."
1,Not the same anymore,"I purchased six boxes of what showed as ""Good Earth Original Sweet & Spicy Caffeine Free Tea"". It was a good thing that I still had my old box of tea, so that I could compare. Not only did they change the look of the box, but they went to the dark side and changed the recipe as well. Did anyone notice that they didn't have lemongrass in it anymore? Did anyone notice that they took off the ""Gluten-free"" stamp? And last but not least, they added artificial flavoring to it. Are you kidding? So, they took a winner and turned it into a lousy product. Does that make sense to anyone else out there? I sent them all back!"
4,Good Earth Original Tea,"My favorite Herbal Tea. It tastes kinda like Big Red chewing gum, but in a delicious way. About a dollar cheaper a box then if I buy it locally since only the heath food stores carry it around here."
3,Good Earth Original Formula Change?,"Has anyone else noticed that the flavor seems to have changed in recent batches of Good Earth Original? I find it much ""twiggier"" for lack of a better descriptor, and not NEARLY as sweet and good as it was before. I'm going to buy another box to make sure that this isn't totally random, but this was the case with two boxes I bought, one of Original and one of Original Decaf. Other friends of mine have noticed this as well; I really hope they didn't change the formula because it is/was my favorite tea and I don't like what I'm tasting now!"
1,Disgusting,Ugh they changed the formula/ blend of their tea! It tastes dusty. Oh so sad - the box which is new to me says new look same taste but this is not true.I bought 6 boxes and it's all getting tossed- so disappointed with this purchase and amazon for not taking it back
1,AWFUL. A disaster; what happened to the tea I used to love?,"I have enjoyed Good Earth tea (in the old yellow box) for years and years; it was by far my favorite bagged tea. But the last time I bought a box, in the ugly new purple packaging, I was horribly disappointed -- it tastes NOTHING like the original version. It is bitter, not sweet, with an almost metallic quality. I drank cup after cup, hoping it was just my imagination, but now I'm throwing the rest of it out. I wish I could give it zero stars, but apparently that's not an option on Amazon. I will sadly never again buy this tea unless they return it to its original, perfect flavor."
5,Yummy!,I have been drinking this tea on and off for years. It has such a wonderful flavor with the spices and sweetness.
1,Contains Artificial Flavors!,"After trying this tea at a friend's house I was smitten, so I immediately went home and ordered from Amazon. The written description clearly states that there are no artificial flavors in it, so imagine my disappointment when I received the tea which does indeed have artificial flavors in it!! To Amazon's credit they refunded my money immediately (there are no returns in the grocery department). However, I would have rather saved myself the hassle of placing the order at all had I know that it contained artificial flavors."
2,Way too sweet and concentrated!,I tried Madagascar vanilla red by Celestial which also contains Rooibos. So I thought I'd give this a try due to the great reviews. First impression tea is way too sweet and can't wrap my mind around what ingredient causes this sweet taste. If you like your tea very sweet and concentrated then this is the one for you. After trying both teas hands down Madagascar Vanilla Red is way tastier!
5,Yum,This tea is perfect for cold winter days. I don't let it steep for very long because the flavor gets a little too intense for me.
1,Good Earth Tea Goes Down the Drain,"Good Earth Tea (Original Sweet and Spicy)~ whether caffeinated or decaffeinated has been my favorite tea for many years. I am sick with disappointment over degraded and truly unrecognizable taste of this formerly perfect cup of tea. I will be telling all the friends I have introduced to the ""good old recipe"" over the years that our Good Earth Tea is no longer the same and that they should not waste their money on the newrecipe. I'll be taking the last four boxes I bought back to the grocery store for a refund. I called the TATA company this morning to find out the scoop on the change of the taste of the tea and to register my disappointment. If anyone from the new Good Earth Company reads Amazon reviews, please take note of all the complaints and plead with your company to go back to the ""good old recipe"" once again!"
1,"Oh, how the mighty have fallen","This has been my favorite tea for at least fifteen years. It was the best tea I'd ever had - naturally sweet, pungent with gingery spice, unbelievably fragrant and satisfying. I recommended it to anyone and everyone.I am currently drinking my first cup of tea from the last box of Good Earth ""Original"" Sweet & Spicy Tea I currently plan to buy. The badge says ""New look! same great taste!"" but only the first claim is true. Once all-natural (see above description), the second ingredient is now ""artificial flavor,"" and it shows. This tea is bland, only a hint of its previous sweetness, virtually no spicy ginger punch. Whatever you have done, Good Earth, it was a mistake. I cannot recommend this new tea to anyone."
3,"I would have liked it more, but...","...I was reading it for school. While this book is a compelling tale about the atrocities committed against the Indians by the white Americans, it is very difficult to retain the information contained in it for testing or quizzing.My enjoyment (or horror) in reading this, however, was severely hindered by my goal: To read for the information. This is just not that kind of a book. I am writing this mainly for the benefit of teachers who are considering using this book for a curriculum tool. Perhaps it should be used for recommended outside reading to give students a feel for the treatment that the American Indians endured at the hands of the intrusive white government, but not as a textbook.All in all, I did enjoy the book. I only wish I had been reading for pleasure, and not work."
2,Fiction as History,"It is sad that this work has become the most popular, certainly on college campuses, of the many histories of the conflicts between the settlers and the indians. Dee Brown was a very talented writer and he wrote some valuable histories. This volume, although well written, is not an accurate historical account. Like many ""histories"" that appeared in the seventies it is a polemic disguised as a work of scholarship. The book may be summarized as ""red man good, white man bad"". Such a simplistic morality fable does not do justice to either the settlers or the indians who were engaged in a great struggle that deserves an accurate retelling."
2,*Yawn* ZZZZzzzzzz,"I was only able to get five chapters into this book- honestly the theme was tedious- treaties were broken, Natives forced to relocate, and/or they were murdered. Also, I thought this book lacking in providing detail about Indian Chiefs and/or village life, etc. Certainly there must be better Native American history books out there."
1,zZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZz,"This book lacked any kind of compelling literature required to spark the interest of any person who reads from the ""young adult"" catagory. It is boring. It tries to spark deep emotion with short descriptions that seem brutal and horrific. And yes they are if you are searching for facts, but if you wish to read a book that keeps you interested WHILE at the same time states facts, I suggest you look somewhere else."
5,American History Told by Those Who Were Here First,"In ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"", Dee Brown offers a compelling and honest view of Native American history told by the natives themselves. It is a heartwrenching and depressing account of one of the greatest atrocities comitted by one race of people against another - the drive of Native Americans from their homeland, the destruction of their culture and the lack of respect and due justice they recieved from the United States Government. This is a central piece of American history that is often brushed under the carpet. ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"" is written in compelling, striking language. Your skin will crawl when you read about the Sand Creek Massacre. A must read for all Americans.""I will fight no more, forever."" - Chief Sitting Bull."
5,Enlightening,This book was extremely enlightening. I did not know that it was that bad. I can admit I was ignorant to what Native Americans have gone through. I recommend this book to any and everyone. It puts a whole new perspective on things.
3,Great while it lasts,"As was the case for many other reviewers, mine started off working great. However, after 6 months of use, where I open an average of 2 cans per day, mine is completely worn out. It will no longer open a can. For a product that claims to be of high quality, I expected more. I'm now looking for a similar design can opener that will last. I expect a manual can opener to last many years."
5,safety first,"My sister suggested I purchase this can opener. I was shopping online to get a new can opener. I have 3 in the house, all old and they just dont do the job anymore. My sister said this one opens from the side. Did you ever think when opening cans, the metal shavings were actually falling in your food? I didnt. Now I do. I feel confident this can opener will do the job without letting metal shavings fall into the food, but I havent used it yet. Still a better can opener than the old fashion kind. Good price. I saw can openers that opened from the top which lets the shavings drop into the food, at a higher price than what Amazon sold this one for. Also, didnt pay for shipping. Bought it along with a 10 inch non stick pan and a spider (lifts food from water or oil while cooking.) Free shipping is what I consider a bonus and usually the turning point for making a purchase."
3,Not the usual opener,"It can go into the dishwasher,no sharp edges,but it takes more than 1 revolution to open can sometimes 3 times around.Not good for hands that are weak or impatient.I would look for around for a better one"
5,Works great,"Works nicely, although I don't use the tiny plier feature to remove the lid once it has been cut."
2,Outdated,This movie was a waste of time. I thought it would tell me more about the person was that had made Superman so famous. But it really just was a poor excuse for trying to prove he hadn't committed suicide afterall.
1,DISSERVICE TO GEORGE REEVES,This movie is not very good and it is a disservice to the memory of the Late Great George ReevesNoel SerranoGeorge Reeves Group-2007Hi.5 Network
2,Fails to deliver.,"Hollywoodland starring Ben Affleck is a boring biopic of Superman television star the late George Reeves. This film is slow and irritating to say the least. Diane Lane is good as always while Affleck is just ok as Reeves, he has never been given a role that does anything for him I think. The film shows both point of views, did George Reeves kill himself or was he brutually murdered? To this day, no one knows for sure and Hollywoodland does little to make a decisive point. Skip this one!"
2,"Up, Down and Away!",I enjoyed the bonus materials and the feature film delivered more than an hour of decent entertainment. I enjoyed the care the designers had taken to re-create Old Hollywood and I enjoyed the acting and the characters. And then the story collapsed and the film got weak--very weak. It was as though Superman just gave up fighting crime and became a Kryptonite junkie. Huh. Worth a rental.
5,Hollywood Murder George Reeves SUPERMAN,"This is simply a women scorned had him knocked off..If they unfold the facts he was almost knocked off earlier with car crash .Everybody connected with him wanted him dead..The truth will come out..The studio heads bought out his mother's investigation..Suicide no way,no powder burns on body..Gun wipped clean..His mother made sure he died a hero...He was known as honest George with integrityWhat is the answer he was knocked off..You be the judge and jury and clean the slate..."
2,Dull,"Given the interesting subject matter, Hollywoodland is a real snoozer. The movie's biggest flaw, aside from its glacier-like pace, is a woefully miscast Adrien Brody. He spends the whole movie moping around with a hangdog expression. He mumbles his dialog and comes across more like a B-movie mobster than a film noir detective.Ben Affleck was quite good and he's the reason this film gets 2 stars instead of zero. They could have eliminated the Brody detective subplot entirely, and it would have been a much better film."
1,Drama class schmaltz,"Tom, leave the schmaltz to ""The Great White Way"". Absolutely ,without a doubt, Tom's worst effort to date. It simply is what it is, ""Broadway"". To me, trying to listen to this album is completely impossible. Sorry Tom,you're an artist of the highest order and I love all of your other work, but some times even the golden goose lays a rotten egg."
3,Overdramatic Dynamics,"In a misguided attempt at drama, Pommer starts these pieces with such soft pianissimos that I could not hear a thing even with my volume turned up to the max. Having the volume at a max soon turned out to be a bad idea as the recording became extremely loud. However, if you don't mind twenty seconds or so of silence replacing the beginning of each track, it is possible to listen to the CD without resorting to constantly changing the volume.Indeed, beyond this complaint, I found the recording to be a fairly good interpretation of the pieces. As Debussy did write in fairly extreme dynamics, I find it hard to place to much blame on the orchestra. Their performance would have been great in a concert hall, but I would still have expected a Radio Symphony Orchestra to have a better feeling for what is possible on modern stereo equipment."
2,Not durable enough for class 2/3 work,"I purchased this hitch to move gooseneck trailers around on my farm. The 3 point hitch onthe back of my tractor is rated to lift either 4,000 or 6,000lbs -- two tractors. Less than a week after I recieved this hitch I was able to bend the two arm-mounts to the point where I felt it was unsafe to continue to use it.What bent was not the pin itself, but the metal that the pin is mounted on. The bottom crossbar is not built heavily enough to allow the unit to lift moderately heavy trailers. Since the 3 point arms cannot lift more than their rated weights, weights under 6,000lbs tongue weight were too much for this unit, and I suspect that weights of 2,000lbs were probably too much, as most of the trailers were empty or partially full when being moved.I would expect a class 2/3 attachment to be able to handle typical 2/3 loads. this particular one is only suitable for light duty.We ended up cutting off the bottom bar and welding on a stronger support for the pins."
3,Much larger and cumbersome then pictured,"Scraper works decently. As others have said, you can't flip the item and use the opposite side of the scraper due to the screw and angle design. The end-cap that holds the spare blades is a definite positive, but the cap itself is made by a poor-molding process which causes the cap to be very difficult to remove. Overall, the tool offers no advantage over using a razor blade by hand that I have found yet. I've used higher-quality razor scrapers that do offer the advantage of lessened hand fatigue, so my advice is to look at a pricier product.PROS- Handle holds additional blades- Comes with extra razor blades and a single plastic scraperCONS- Cap for handle is very difficult to remove- Adjustment screw makes it difficult to use both sides of blade- No reduction in hand fatiqueOVERALLProfessionals should look at higher-quality scrapers. The garage mechanic should just invest in cut-resistant gloves and use a blade by hand."
1,junk chinese knockoff,"Light weight, warps blade when screw is tightened, used (tried to use) for 2 hours, threw in trash. ONLY BUY THE REAL THING."
4,Flight Across the Mekong,"I found this book very interesting and captivating - I am65years old and even though the clientele aimed at is between 9 and15, the author has kept me wanting to read more, it was difficult to put the book down. Congratulations to Jennifer Cook, keep up the good work."
3,Not Quite White,"I specifically purchased these because I thought that they were ""white"", as the description lists, they are not.There are the classic zip-tie color, somewhat transparent, somewhere between white and very light yellow.I was expecting a solid white color."
5,It will help you see how the church should be run,"I am very impressed with Barna's book, as he hits the nail on the head on a number of issues. Based on his research, this Christian pollster shows how the church should relate to the world around it. I am going to go through this again--I highlighted throughout--and write down the main points. I also want to give this book to my pastors, as there are a number of areas my local church could improve. If we want to see God work in our churches, then we need to be smart and use biblical principles and practices. Barna definitely provides us with a solid work here."
4,spinna spinna suger,the mixed cd was off the hindges (mr. spinna proves he's got the goods in his crates and on the wheels).. the unmixed cd's hold those same tracks in their entirety and are excellent for you to mix at your next party (if you dare).
1,Pathetic,This group is pathetic. They are out of tune on several songs & not even close to the originals. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.
3,Fair live album,"Hagar live,released about 3 years after it was recorded.At the time of its release he was a big star on Geffen records.This album is rather skimpy,most songs are fairly weak,but ok."
5,An Uplifting Inspiration,"I read this book when it was first published in the late 80's. I enjoyed it so much that I gave the book away to friends and asked them to also pass it on to others. I found this book to be very inspirational and courageous. If you have ever read any of Kurt Vonnegut's books, you will know that his sister had died of cancer. What you learn from this book is that her husband died on the very same day and the children from that family went to Kurt Vonnegut and his wife who already had three children of their own. Sounds too much to be true? Well, sometimes that's the way life is.This book is about this woman's efforts to come to terms with what happened during those times of getting their ""new"" children."
1,Movie could not even begin to compare with the show,"I have been a fan of the Mr. Bean BBC series for some time now. His antics are hilarious! But this movie really disgraced the show. I found it almost totally unwatchable. There was a lack of good comedy throughout the entire movie. The jokes and dialogue was like that of a awfully directed NBC sitcom [are there any good ones]. It was a waste of time, money and the comedy was not equal to the worst episodes of the of the Mr. Bean show. Don't waste the time or money, i would give it .5 stars but the lowest they have is a 1."
4,Stick to the British way of humour.,I have seen Bean on TV and he is extremly funny when it is done by the Brits. Sure the moive was funny but they Americanised it to much.
2,Bad choice.,"I thought this was a show I could watch with my 6 year-old. I stopped the movie soon after it started because of the crude humor, and it wasn't all that funny. You can only act stupid for so long."
5,GET READY TO LAUGH,"If you are a Bean fan, you are just going to love this! If you are not a Bean fan, you will be! He wears raw foul on his head better than anyone!"
5,Hilarious,"If you are already a fan of Mr. Bean and haven't yet seen this movie, run to the store!! Watch the disaster-man come to America...A famous American painting is bought from the Brits and goes back to the US; the British art museum is asked to send a renown art scholar who will deliver a speech during the celebration of the masterpiece return. They decide to send Bean. He is no scholar, of course, he's just a watchman they wish they could fire; but they can't, so they are happy to get rid of him at least for a couple of months by sending him to the States.Some of the antics are taken from the TV series, but there are many new ones you will enjoy. The episode of Mr. Bean's arrival to the airport is priceless, as well as his ""performance"" in front of the mirror-wall at the police station.Highly recommended to any Bean lover."
4,You'll ache from laughing,"This is a fantastic movie for when you want to relax and laugh. Mr. Bean is so predictable and outrageous, but it usually turns out right for him. He's truly a gifted actor to be able to portray a feeling without using words (or few words). The story line is predictable but has twists to it that keep you guessing. Mr. Bean is a great movie, and it would take a real stick-in-the-mud person to not enjoy laughing with Mr. Bean."
3,"Funny at moments but not as good as the original, sequel, and animated series","""Comical, corny, unserious, and offbeat- this is what Bean is best at doing. However, Mr. Bean's Holiday was more of a solidified than this one. Rowan Atkinson acting like a plum is what makes the Mr. Bean character stand out, period! It is a little bored of out itself and kind of veers the course of being its own film and skimming the origin story, which for many British audiences, might be confusing. Still, it is fun to watch something of an homage to Laurel & Hardy, French miming, and The Three Stooges."""
1,just too weird to be funny,"I love the johnny english movies, so when I saw that rowan atkinson was the main character in this movie and I saw all the good reviews, I got it... and was so disappointed. it was just WEIRD. I did not like it at all. I thought it might be funny.I was so totally wrong. I really DO NOT recommend this movie to anyone."
2,Items missing,"Haven't tried it on her yet, but at least the pants will fit and the sunhat fits, the hoodie will fit her nicely too so it's all OK. The shoes are size 6 (EUR size 22) and are way too big for my daughter (she uses EUR size 19 and that's just beginning to fit her).Both bags were missing and also the changing mat. Those items I could have used, but i guess I'll have to do without them.Oh, and also, the bikini isn't made from the spandex type swimsuit material as most swimsuits, and therefor doesn't really streatch and could be more oncomfortable because of it."
3,Not quite there,"I believe that the author accomplished all she said she did with her gift. However, being a mere mortal, I was unable to make much progress using her technique. Perhaps the fault lies with me, but I was not really able to connect with this technique. To each her own."
3,Rockihn...,"It's truly a shame that so many of Greg Kihn's releases are out of print in CD and that people are asking such ridiculous amounts of money for them.Kihnspiracy sports the minor hit ""Jeopardy"", which spawned the Weird Al ""(I Lost On) Jeopardy"" version. Imitation is a great form of flattery, and Greg Kihn definitely penned a number of great tunes over the years. I'd recommend picking this up on vinyl, which should be readily available for a few bucks.Although I do enjoy Kihnspiracy, if you're looking for a good introduction to Kihn's work (other than a ""Best of""), I'd suggest RocKihnRoll. However, there are still some great tunes to be enjoyed here including Jeopardy, Tear That City Down, and How Long. Don't let the 3-star rating discourage you from picking this up if you find a copy. I would have easily given it another half star if I could.I look forward to picking up more of Greg Kihn's work on vinyl, saving myself a bunch of cash, and enjoying some great under-appreciated music."
5,Pat's best!,"This is my favorite Benetar cd. I particularly like her cover of Alan Parsons' ""Don't Let It Show."""
1,Lasted 1 year and 4 days-Buyers beware,"We liked the picture quality while it lasted-Broken after 1 year-4 days of moderate use. Hyundai warranty is only for 1 year from purchase date. Bought this online and the warranty started when I paid for it, not when we received and started using it (was used less than a year). Warranty was denied. We have rarely had cause to write a review of anything but felt this was necessary to prevent others from buying a bad product. We are going next to buy a major brand LCD TV with a better history, customer service and a local service center!"
1,Didn't Last,"It worked OK in the beginning, but after a few months, it no longer worked. It didn't get a lot of use, only when I needed to add air to the tires. I think it must have gotten stretched and a wire separated in one of the end plugs."
5,Finally!,"Finally this great film is coming to DVD. The Canadian import just did not do the film justice, hopefully, this ""real"" version does. I can finally add this great film to my collection! If you like David Lynch's work, especially perhaps his film Mulholland Drive, definitely check this one out."
5,Crazy dark stuff,This is a great movie the second time will only be better...... Dont pay attention to the people who say dont buy it because its such bad quality who cares its fine... JUST WATCH THE MOVIE AND ENJOY THE CRAZYNESS AND DARKNESS
1,Wow...this is a bad movie!,"If you are sane,please do yourself a favor and do not see this movie.This is the most god awful movie I have ever seen in my whole life.It is very long,and seems like two different movies in the same ""story"".Sounds good,wow two storys,what a value! To bad neither of them make any sense.David Lynch is calling this art!?! Someone needs to beat him with a yellow plastic bat."
1,Uninspired.,"This is David Lynch's most uninspired film, and his worst, second only to Dune, and that's saying a lot. Bill Pullman and Patricia arquette are the worst casting choices, especially coming from a man who I think has assembled some of the most interesting casts ever. I'm convinced that Bill Pullman was cast in Independance Day just to make the aliens look real, next to his wooden and superficial performance. Fire Walk with me was brilliant, emotional, terrifying, heartbreaking. Lost Highway looks to me like the wet dream of a disinterested, but dirty old man. I really lost faith in a great director as a result of watching this film. He has misfired before, sure enough (Wild at Heart, Dune), but at least those disasters showed glimpses of pure genius. Lost highway looks like a REALLLY long Marillyn Manson clip, without even the substance Manson has. Soundtrack is great though."
1,Blah... Blah...Blah...,"Went to see this movie and was expecting a good Lynch-fest like Peaks and Velvet - got junk instead. No story... no character development... no plot... no introduction... no resolution.. no conclusion.. no nothing. Just alot of blah..blah..blah. Like what are you supposed to come away with here. I came away with no interest in this guys films anymore. I like his other stuff, even Eraserhead had a story. This thing? Sorry bud - no ceegar."
2,Pan and Scan,"Just thought I'd warn all the connoisseurs that, yes, this is in fact the pan and scan version. My advice: wait for the new U.S. release. As for the movie itself: standard David Lynch fare: entertaining and incomprehensible--good stuff."
4,Great Movie,"""The Lost Highway"" is by far one of the best movies I have seen. Bill Pullman is cool in this movie, and Patricia Arquette well she is self explanatory. I haven't quite understood why nobody likes this movie because me and my friend thinks it is one of the best movies we've seen in a long time. I find this movie very hillarious, especially the tailgating seen, me and my friend was rolling on the floor after that. Not only is Bill Pullman and Patricia Arquette great in this movie, but there are other actors such as Henry Rollins, and Richard Pryor that make this movie even better. In my opinion David Lynch did a great job in directing this video, his best work yet! I recommend this video for anyone who likes sick humor and a great suspense."
1,By far the worst film I have ever seen.....,"While Lynch fans (who are these people???) will lap this film up, I was alternately bored, humiliated, riled, and depressed. Nothing, and I mean nothing, makes sense and before some pretentious wiseguy tries to tell me about postmodern nihilism or anti-narrative otherness, let me say that while film can be an instructive tool, it must also be entertaining and I can't imagine who would want to curl up with this waste of time at any point in their day. I would describe plot elements, but they would be irrelevant. Proceed at your own risk."
3,....................,"This movie was okay. I can see people comparing it to ""art"". But, c'mon, people, why can't anyone fess up to the fact that Lynch is basically just tooling around with all of us? Perhaps the goal of the movie was to get us thinking about the meaning of which there is none? Perhaps he just wanted us to have our own interpretation? Perhaps there is no real answer? It's just a notion of mine. Why is it, for something to be truly artsy it has to have a red balloon that pops causing the sun to eclipse or a man dying and becoming someone else? I've seen plenty of reality shattering movies that don't take it to the extreme Lynch did. Look at Dark City, Devil's Advocate, City of Lost Children, Closetland, The Matrix, etc. These are all movies that didn't go over our head but didn't underestimate us either. In LH's case, I think it underestimated us AND went over our heads. Sad really. I'm a huge Twin Peaks fan. I just don't see what all the fuss is about with this project. Theo"
2,Best movie! Worst DVD!,"As an ultimate fan of Lynch's work, I am really shocked by this dismal Canadian edition of the truly magnificent Lost Highway - Lynch's truly ""grande oeuvre"". It's a shame, to say the least, that such a piece of art could be demeaned in such a way by the horrid quality of this recording. And I certainly can't believe Lynch himself would have approved of this outrage. Get the film by all means, but please don't buy this DVD!"
1,Worst DVD ever,"I had been waiting so long for this movie - probably my favourite David Lynch - to come out on DVD that I grabbed the Canadian import the moment I saw it... unfortunately it is by far the worst quality commercial DVD I have ever seen.The format is pan-and-scan (i.e. 4:3 ratio) only and the image quality is appalling. The sound (Dolby, supposedly) is little better. It is basically unwatchable. Another user review says that the DVD is somewhat better than VHS - I would say the image quality is on par with VHS, and certainly not worth the four stars that reviewer gave it; I cannot imagine how any DVD could be worse than this one.I am sure that David Lynch had nothing to do with this hastily cobbled together sham. He fine tunes his DVDs (even to the extent of removing chapters from ""The Straight Story"") and I am sure he would be furious to see his movie butchered in this way.This DVD is of the quality I would expect if I bought the damn thing from a street vendor in Shanghai; ..."
1,Lost Highway,"This movie SUCKS!!! It was made with a $15 million budget, Obviously someone walked off with $14,999,900.00 in thier pocket. After watching the first ten minutes of this movie, I shoved a very sharp pencil through my eye. May only regret was that I only had one pencil. I now know why Robert Blake shot his wife!!! The only reason I am giving this movie one star, is because that is the lowest rating that can be given. Once again, THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"I was dreaming to see this movie for a long time, since 1997. And finally I bought it in Europe for 10 Euro. So what did I find there? Nothing, there is lack of everything. Anyone can shoot something like this, adding clowns in movie does not make it masterpiece. It is not that I do not like David Lynch's movies but here Mr. Lynch and some other people simply wanted to make money. One of the worsest movies ever seen."
5,Lost Highway,"Here is how the story goes. My friend is a big David Lynch fan. He gave me some ideas for his birthday and this and Eraserhead is mostly what he wanted.I was disappointed. I knew these movies were rare and I was told I would have to pay a pretty penny for both. Little did they know!I went online here and couldn't believe it. I actually found them! Such reasonable prices for 2 great movies! I was so excited that I ordered this and Eraserhead right away. They were delivered fast and both movies play wonderfully.I, too, am a big David Lynch fan now and am tempted to buy these movies for myself. My friend was thrilled. Everyone was satisfied.This company is amazing. I won't order online from anywhere else. Thank you Amazon!"
4,good product,"I've gotten other over the counter night guards before and this is by far the most comfortable. I seem to bite through them in about six months or so, but it beats paying the $300+ to have a guard made at the dentist"
2,Uncomfortable,"This guard didn't fit right - uncomfortable, and I found it very difficult to sleep that I had to take it out. Unfortunately, I will have to keep looking but thinking the ones you boil and mold to your teeth would be better for me."
1,"Harry Livingstone, Professional Disinfo Agent","Skip ANY and EVERYTHING written by this jive hummer. He is a sham and veteran disinformation agent... I have been investigating, writing and editing JFK assassination (and so forth) material since the early 70s, and this comes from personal experience."
1,Not Worth Buying,"I first read this book because I was told that Jack Rogers was an inspiring writer who broke from his conservative background to forward progressive causes for alternative communities. What I found was that he didn't have much to say. Reading the book of Confessions is intersting enough (or not, depending on who you ask), and it can't and doesn't really need to be made more clear."
3,"Fun truck, but broke quickly","Got this for my five year old son, and he loved it! The boom and claw move well to pick up and stack the logs. However, a small piece piece on the trailer broke and it was a critical piece-- attached the truck to the trailer. Super glue did the trick, so it is back in action, but this toy is not super sturdy."
4,Trucks,"Brought this for my son who loves big trucks. He dad is a log truck driver, so this was a great gift."
2,bad soundtrack,"lovely picture quality but bad soundtrack transfer. the cute 'come out' song is particularly bad - the orchestra sounds 'wobbly'. my old vhs copy is way better.a pity, because this early sinatra movie has some musical gems."
1,Woman's SS Eternity Band,The stones turned black after a short period of time. The silver finish remained shiny but was very disappointed in the stones.
3,Ring.......,"I was disappointed in the ring. It looked so nice on the internet that is why I thought I had to have it, I thought it was very elegant and the width of the band was just what I was looking for. But two days after I received it two stones fell out. However I emailed the company right away and they are replacing it for me, I will be mailing it 8-17-07. I only hope that the replacement will last me a longer time that I can enjoy it. I am giving three stars because the Customer Service that I received was very good.Sept 4, 2007. I got my replacement ring in the mail, it was beautiful. However 2 days after I had it two stones feel out of it again. It is not like I was digging in a garden while wearing it. I am very dissapointed with the product. The ring is very beautiful when you first get it, but the way the stones are placed in it make it not even worth buying."
2,"Like Dr. Evil said, one calorie just ain't enough","This album has one of the most gorgeous pop songs of the 1990's in ""I'm So Lonely,"" but sadly, the rest of the album fails to live up to its shimmering heights. A couple of the other songs are pleasant (""Free Me,"" ""Guiding Star""), but save your money, especially at this price. Definitely not worth it. Go buy the La's album instead."
4,great beginner glockenspiel,"Great beginner glockenspiel but with the rubber mallets the volume is not as great. Plastic mallets work better. I have the acclaimed Angel AX-25 glockenspiel which works as great and has plastic mallets. The CB has the size of a more adult instrument (but more for teens than adults) but for sound you can't beat the Angel, but it is not better than the CB when plastic mallets are used. These 2 glockenspiels are conveniently small and light, and great for any age. The bars for the CB are white and black and aluminum, those for the Angel are steel and all silvery. This instrument is wrongly called bells or orchestra bells--it is a glockenspiel and the German name means ""bells play"" but not because they are bells, but because bells were used before the bars. It is also wrongly called a xylophone, xylophone bars are made of wood."
5,A Story Worth Watching,"This is a beautiful movie. There is tension, drama, sadness, and humor--the fundamentals to keep one interested. But it is much more than that. Without being cloying or predictable, this movie is about being a good and decent person, despite our all too common imperfections and desires. Highly recommended!"
5,Please except the ending,"Everyone I know who saw The Game hated the ending (as I'm sure many of you did), but it does make sense, just don't let it get to you. If you haven't seen it and you like David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club) you'll love this."
4,An intelligent thriller.,"Michael Douglas true to type cast and obviously enjoying the part, turns an average night table thriller into a memorable movie with a dash of steel. Sean Penn plays the degenerate brother, with all his charasmatic subtlety. A movie for intelligent adults who have little patience for mediocrity. DVD compliments the excellent photography, outstanding score and unique settings."
3,horrible HD-DVD transfer,"I gave this flick a 7 out of 10 over at IMDB, but I would give it a 1 out of 10 for it's HD transfer. The movie in HD looks absolutely dull. Save yourself a few bucks and buy the standard DVD title. You'll end up with the same video quality."
3,GREAT MOVIE BUT ? HAPPENDED TO THE PICTURE,"THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF DAVID FINCHERS BEST YET IT HAS NO BONUS MATERIAL AND THE PICTURE IS HORRIBLE, ONLY BUY FOR THE PURPOSE OF OWNING A GREAT FILM NOT FOR THE TRANSFER! (3 STARS FOR THE MOVIE ITSELF NOT THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS HD DVD)"
3,Entertaining yet too overrated,"This movie is surely entertaining, from beginning to end. However this does not deserve a five-star rating for several reasons. I expected to see more explaining at the end of the movies. The character Christine said to Van Orton (Michael Douglas) that there is a ""safety net"" on every plot and scene in the game. But how the safety net was done is never known. It was as if the game has proceeded in a very precise path, without unexpected twists on Van Orton's part.My conclusion, however lacking of explanation this movie is at the ending, still this is an entertaining movie worth watching."
1,dangerous philosophy,"The philosophy of this film is a very dangerous one: This ist faschism in it's most modern way, blasphemy, man's arrogance in it's most concentrated way. There is no man on earth to whom anyone has the right to play games like that. This is no game - this is brainwashing, breaking the rules, hurting human dignity. No man on earth has the right to do things like these to another - no matter how evil the man should be: God has meant men to be free to decide wether to be good or to be bad. This freedom cannot and MUST not been taken away by man. Or we will find us somewhere in a somewhat ""brave new world""!Summary: How a pity that Nicholas revolver didn't really shoot - all who where taking part in this game should have been killed! They must be supposed to be members of a dangerous sect."
5,Great Movie!,I thought this movie was great! Its one of those movies you just can't stop watching until the very last minute. It has parts that the audience wouldn't expect at all! But the one part that I just loved was the ending. A wonderful to watch I recommend this movie to people who like action-thrillers and like movies that make you think.
1,One of the worst endings I've seen,"Fincher has this thing with endings. ""Seven"" was awful until the final 30 minutes, which contained his best work. ""The Fight Club"" was wittier than I expected, but the ending was abysmal. And ""The Game"" has the worst ending of any movie I can think of right now. If you thought it was a good ending, do yourself a favor -- replay the movie, for real or in your head, and look at how close Douglas's character comes to being killed. Then replay the ending and his reaction when he discovers it's all a ""game."" ""The Twilight Zone,"" was more in tune to human nature than this is."
1,A Hollywood Insult,"Put your imagination on hold, place your intellect on the shelf, and maybe, just maybe, you might enjoy this movie. lt is perhaps the most contrived shlock film with the most ludicrous plot and the most impossible events and occurrences of any film l've ever seen in the past 60 years. lf you don't shake your head in despair by the middle of this muddle, you are probably not a film buff. And if you don't burst out laughing at the incredulous conclusion, you qualify for the ""Edd Wood Award For Puerility"". Shame on the writer, producer, director & studio!"
4,One of best psycological thrillers ever made,"The Game is by far one of the single best psycological thrillers ever made movie wise. Of course it is from the director of Seven, the movie is a slow pace here and there but you have to watch the whole movie to fully understand the big picture. I personally love suspense trillers and try to guess the plotline as the movie progresses along the timeline of the movie. When I first saw this movie I never expected the outcome that occured in the movie but it is one of few movies I can watch from start to finish and keep my intrest all the way threw to the end. So if you enjoy some good suspense triller movies, and trying to guess the outcome of the movie as the movie goes along then this is the movie for you to enjoy and watch on a day off from work or with some pals."
5,On of thebest movies I've ever seen.,"This is one of the greatest movies I've even seen. It has many plot twists, lots of suspence and an ending that fits perfectly with the rest of the movie. If you want to see a movie that you will honestly remember for a long time, watch The Game"
3,A movie about facing inner fears.,"I wasn't able to maintain my suspension of disbelief for this conspiracy-minded movie. However, I liked the way Douglas' character was forced to confront his personal demons and reconsider what he valued. But compared to thrillers like Kurt Russell's ""Breakdown,"" the movie was less suspenseful than I expected."
5,Works great,"The double 110 is a nice thing to have when punching multiple pairs down, it makes it so much faster"
2,not too useful,"while this book had some interesting ideas for basic techniques, I really felt wanting from the descriptions of how to do the work. The author's descriptions were too general and stopped way short of something I could really put into action in the field."
4,A Good Light-Hearted Story,"Nothing exciting ever happened to Henry Huggins. That is, until the day he met a stray dog and decided that he HAD to keep him. Predictably, he and ""Ribsy"" have many humorous adventures together, and these stories are what make up ""Henry Huggins"". From that first ride home that starts on a city bus and ended in a police car, to a dog show that sees Ribsy sporting pink fur, to the final test of loyalty that will make all readers breathless with anticipation, the story is well told. Everything in this book is carried out in a pleasant and easy-to-read manner, so children should have no trouble staying with the story, even if there are few pictures. Even though it was published over 50 years ago, ""Henry Huggins"" is still a valuable book to have in your collection."
4,Works Good,"Love This Product it works well and it ships early all the time, ad comes as they say in the picture"
2,They will give you blisters-oh the pain!,"I bought these red fins from the sports shop last month and took them back....the size was perfect, but they are very stiff and gave me the most PAINFUL blisters ever. Plus, certain parts of the rubber just jab right into the bone of my feet, making the swimming experience extremely painful.I even bought fin socks...didn't help...I used to swim competitively, and bought these because it was the model recommended for speed and racing purposes, but I used them more for straight lap swimming and fast kicking....maybe the blue ones are more comfortable, but I know that for me, these red ones just killed my feet.I guess the're just meant to be worn for 5 minutes (or 1 lap) in the water, or something..."
2,Interesting as a reflection of it's time,"File on the Tsar is interesting as a compilation of escape theories popular in the 1970's, most of which have since been proven to be false, particularly in Radzinsky's The Last Tsar (which would be a good book to read after this one). Still, the writing style is engaging and the photos are well chosen. Take it's theories with a grain of salt and it is a fun read."
2,Strange taste,"This tea lists green tea, jasmine, and ""natural flavor"" as the ingredients. This tea taste nothing like other jasmine teas I have had - it is much sweeter. My first taste impression was of pez (yes, the little sugar candy pellets that come from pez dispensers). I guess some may like it but it is not my cup of tea."
4,great flavor,I need to stay away from caffeine so this is a great alternate. I can have green tea without the extra caffeine and Good Earth teas are always very flavorful.
5,This is really good tea...,"I've always bought the Good Earth Lemongrass Green Tea, but I wanted to try something new so I bought this Super Green Tea. The Lemongrass tea is probably the best green tea I've ever had, so naturally I didn't have high expectations going into this tea. After opening the teabag of this Super Green Tea, I knew immediately that I was going to love this tea. You can smell all the aromas of the tea and none of them are overwhelming on the nose. Once brewed, I couldn't stop drinking this tea. Like the Lemongrass tea, each of this tea's flavors are brought out and none of them are overbearing. The orange oil is perfect; not too much nor too little is in the tea. After drinking two cups of this tea, I'm ready to say that this tea has replaced the Good Earth Lemongrass tea as my go to green tea."
1,toilet safety rail,"The product looked great, but after 3 hours of taking off commode bolts, this apparatus would not fit on our toilet--which was to be used by my elderly father. Since it involves a commode, I assumed that nothing can be sent back, and we were out money. It says it fits all toilets, but not true, and difficult to attach--which was not mentioned."
2,WEB Griffin police series,"Griffin is a good writer, but he tends to repeat information from his earlier novels in a series WAY more than to my liking. I skip over a great deal of each subsequent novel because of this. If you are a regular reader, why do you need to rehash all that's happened before? No other series author I know (and read) does this to the extent Griffin does. Ruins an otherwise nice series."
4,"Scrumptious recipes, numerically challenged","The recipes look wonderful. We haven't tried any yet since we only got the book yesterday. But I can't help but notice, p. 18, that Ms. Werlin really does believe ""regular sandwich bread"" is only 1/4"" thick. Our current loaf of ordinary sliced bread has slices almost exactly 1/2"" thick. Maybe her ""regular"" bread is diet fodder. That would help to explain her trim appearance commented on by an earlier reviewer. At any rate, we look forward to many happy grilled cheese sandwiches, most with (for us) exotic ingredients.John Lowry"
5,Vitec Vit E Cream is a life saver!,"Some times I feel I have some of the most sensitive skin in the world and discovering Vitec Vitamin E Cream has been the answer to a long and expensive search for a moisturizer my skin could tolerate. As a light, soothing moisturizer, I use it mornings before I put on my makeup and at night after I shower. I use it when ever I feel the effects winter heat or outdoor sun and wind. I highly recommend Vitec Vitamin E Cream to others with sensitive skin."
3,Japanese art overview,"This volume is a good overview of the arts of Japan from a historical perspective. The perspective is decidedly Western, however, and tends to overstate the relevance of ""fine arts"" as opposed to the so-called ""minor arts"" and crafts. Thus, woodblock prints are given less space than their cultural impact would imply. More importantly, ceramics are accorded very little space - a major shortcoming to any art history of Japan."
2,puhhhh-thetic,"Nothing special at all about this book. Just a lot of vodka, weeping and a poor stab at ghosts and or demons. I read the countless instances where he was weeping, and couldn't feel an ounce of his sorrow. I read about the demon toy doll and just fought to get through those pages. The terby ripped apart a horse, the toy scratched up a door and then a mound of hair attacked him. Almost like a bad R rated episode of scooby doo.BEE's previous novel, Glamaroma, a masterpiece, makes this book read even worse than it really does. If writing Glamorama almost killed him, then writing this book was just a stroll to the bank in comparison. It's only fitting that in Lunar Park, his dog, properly named Victor, despises him and eventually almost kills him. I'd give this 1 star, but at least the author writes that his desire to create characters like Patrick Bateman has come to an end, which warns that this book won't have any special characters. Which it doesn't."
2,groupe therapy,"Bret Easton Ellis (BEE) Astounded me with his use of symbolism, and skill at parallelism. These things made me appreciate the writing and story line, but i just couldn't connect with the charicters, I could see the drama but couldnt feel it.I felt that i was looking in on somebodys deep and personal problems who had written them down to help them work out thier problems. I felt that B E E was using me ( or the audiance) to help him out and i just diddnt want to get drawn in. I felt like i diddnt belong. I could see his problem from the begging, and the book kept saying it over and over again in many differnt ways. I guess Props to B E E for lacking Brievity but maby I just represent America in its rejection of anything thats not short and to the point."
2,couldn't get into it,"I'm a big fan of his earlier work, American Psycho--a very good novel and movie is fairly good with an awesome portrayal of Patrick Bateman by the new Batman Christian Bale. This book had a lot to live up to...I mean it's not even a second rate Less than Zero.Read about one third of it before I put it away."
4,a quick read ... a long afterthought,"Clearly his best book yet. A metafictional horror story or a suburban gothic memoir written by a deranged heir of Schopenhauer and John Rechy. His technique is impressive as he sustains a Klein Bottle of a novel that reads like William Burroughs and John Irving channeled by Vladimir Nabokov. The last twenty pages not only provide a sublime lyrical coda, they exemplify suberb contemporary prose."
3,Ellis' Best Days Are Gone,"I'm somewhat divided after reading this book. Part of me can understand that the author is clearly ageing and dealing with certain issues that pertain to his troubled existence - so I could see this is being some kind of carthartic experience for Bret.But although the book starts off quite well, it morphs into a boring and kind of pointless series of ""shocking"" ghost stories.I've read all of Ellis' books, this to me is easily his weakest story. If you want to read a great scary book, written the way Ellis used to write when he was in his prime, check out ""Lullaby"" or ""Invisible Monsters"" by Chuck Palahniuk.I found ""Lunar Park"" to be very disappointing, especially after a seven year wait."
2,okay but not the greatest,"this book started off great - ellis writes in an entertaining fashion as in his other novels (and takes it back to the basics as he claims to do in the opening chapter). as i got into it, it got a bit too fantastical for my liking. if you are looking for a quick 1-2 day read, you can grab this book. my main problem with the book is that i expected to be moved and feel for the characters, but just when i was about to, uncanny freak coincidences take over and ulitmately those take away from the character development."
5,Saw,"Its awesome, still works no problems. Its tough and the battery lasts a long time.Its Dewalt, so you could drop it from a ladder and it will still work. Just make sure your over grass when you do drop it."
1,"samsung 30"" slimfit tv",delivery was prompt but it does not tell you its NOT a flat screen even though the picture looks like one the tv is hevy as hell and has a back on the lower half of the tv .
2,Battery fizzles,"This is my very first trimmer, so I didn't have anything to compare it to. But I did notice right away that (a) it doesn't hold a charge very long and (b) takes a while to do the job, with a lot of passes. The short charge life means one more charger I have to take on vacation. It needs so many passes to do the job it takes longer than it used to take to shave, and the battery starts to wind down before I'm done. My now-retired Panasonic shaver would go a week and a half of daily use on a single charge, and I'll be looking for something that good after I get a few months out of this thing. I won't buy another Norelco."
5,Natalie at her best - Please try to get this CD.,"This is a hard to find CD. I remember buying this double album when it came out, I think in 1978. It was recorded in 1977 at the Universal Ampitheater, Los Angeles. This is my favorite album by Natalie, I've been a fan ever since. You even get to hear her chat with the audience between the songs. My favorite is when she says ""Just for you, because you're so wonderful, and because we're having so much fun. You know this is my last performance for a little while. I have some business to take care of"" Here she's talking about being pregnant and having a baby soon. Then she goes on to say, ""From here on in we're gonna let our hair down"" And boy does she. Natalie rocks on this CD - Please find it and buy it now. It's great."
1,Not the brilliant Brightman I expected. Not music for me.,"Listened to ""Time to Say Goodbye"" and ""Dive"" and had to have more. I am sorry to say that this cd is not to my taste at all. It was like listening to someone other than Brightman. I will continue to search for similar works as the above mentioned because she still has a golden voice that touches the soul."
4,There is an ending but it is omitted......,"This really is a great novelization of a George Lucas story but only the first edition printing has the ending to it! For some reason the subsequent editions cut the final two or three pages of the story. Good luck finding a copy of the 1st edition paperback, I haven't seen it since I was in high school 25 years ago!"
4,Wallet without coin pocket,The leather case is excellent if you are looking for a case that can also function as a wallet. The only thing it's lacking is a pocket for coins. It only has room for three credit cards two SD/MMC cards and some bills.
2,Not good for Z22,"Despite what you may read about this, this is NOT a good case for the Z22. Mine keeps falling out because the case is too big. I guess the Z22 is smaller than other models. I wish I could return this. I've only used it once and that was when I got it 3 months ago."
1,Worthless For Palm Z 22,"Okay I guess for Tungsten and Zire model of Palm devices it's a decent enough looking case, I'm not happy about the fact thst Amazon steered me there when I bought my Palm Z-22, even going so far as to suggest it as a bundle. I never owned one of these things, for all I knew ""Z"" as in Z-22 could have stood for Zire, and that's with my clicking for more info. Now I have to go around asking my friends whether they own a Zire or Tungsten, so I can gift it back, unless one of you readers has one of these machines and would like a bargain. I have to warn you though, the plastic is sliced open and retaped, just the way it arrived even though I thought I was buying new, when I made the purchase. In fact the retape job was so poor, I was able to easilly slip the little white elephant right out and right back in again without so much as stretching the tape. Just kidding, I'll find someone who needs one I guess. Tiz the Season after, all."
2,No good with TX,"This case was recommended with the purchase of a T/X. DO NOT BUY IT FOR A T/X. The unit does not properly fit. The T/X sticks out the top about half an inch and the top elastic band on the case covers the top 1/4 inch of the touch screen.My wife has a Tungsten E and the case is a perfect fit for that, but again, it should not be recommended for the T/X!!"
4,Good but perhaps a change in future models,"I really liked the case for my palm. It has little pockets for memory cards and other things like credit cards. I would never tote my credit cards in with my Palm since if I lost that thing I'd really be in trouble. I do keep business cards in it and it's very convenient since I need a business card handy for each time that I use the Palm for business.The future change that I suggest is a different closure that doesn't require looking at the case, a lot of dexterity to get the little tab into the loop, or if your hands are full it's a little hard. I know a magnet wouldn't work because of the Palm. Hmmm...just thinking out loud I guess."
3,Palm Z22 Leather Case,"The case is ok but the Palm wants to slide out of the top. It fits to loosely I guess. Maybe it should have some way to seal off the top of the case that would be removeable when you wanted to take the Palm out, so it wouldn't slide out accidently. I am afraid I will loose it out of the top of the case."
3,It depends on what you need,"This is a beautiful and elegant leather case. It has four compartments on the left leaf to store Wi-Fi cards or SD cards, even business cards. I think it offers a good level of protection against scratches or damage for any fall, but the overall size of the equipment increases a lot; to a point that handheld can not be place on a shirt pocket, or jacket or pants pocket. So functionality of carrying is reduced if you do not have a bigger bag to place it. In my case, I always use a Laptop, so I store my palm on laptop's bag. Other complain I have is the lake of a way to hold the case in a strap or belt. That is way I am rating this neutral with 3."
3,Needs improvement,"I bought this leather case for my palm. It looks very nice but my palm is always slipping from above, because there is no way to keep it attached. It will be much better to have an elastic band in every direction, not only below. I will need to attach it myself and then it will be perfect."
2,Not great for the Palm TX,"This case is nice and of good quality, but it doesn'r really fit the Palm TX very well. The TX has an angled top and bottom, and it's a little too long for the case--as a result, the whole screen is not in the window inside the case (the handheld sticks out the top about 3/8"") , and you really need to take the TX out to use it. I don't know how this fits other Palm devices, but pass on it if you have a TX."
1,not made for the TX,"I bought the Palm Slim Leather Case along with the TX. The case itself is very well made, nicely stitched leather. But it was not designed for the TX. I could not see or touch anything on the top of my screen which meant I had to take it out of the case each time I used it. Not cool. So I cut off the top strip of leather which made it possible to see, but now it does not sit securely in the case. They shouldn't sell it as a case for the TX because it is misleading...doesn't work."
2,"Looks good, non functional","This is one of the only supposedly multi-functional cases I could find for the Palm Z22. However, it's a poor fit all the way around. The palm does not fit snugly in the case and falls out one end despite elastic on 3 sides. There are slots on the left side but not sure what for. They are too small and tight for business cards, and you can't fit a small tablet in there for notes. About the best that can be done is to cram notes and cards in the space underneath. For me this was a waste of money. I would do better to put the Palm in a ziplock baggie."
2,Not a good choice for a Tungsten E,"Like many other users have commented, this case is nicely made, but it doesn't fit the PDA well at all. The leather is too thick and inflexible to provide a secure fit. The cover closes with an awkward tab and loop. The inner 'frame' that is supposed to retain the PDA is a little too deep and angles inward.It just doesn't work well - take a pass, even at this bargain price."
1,Not for the Palm TX,"I bought this case with my TX and only when I opened it I noticed the Palm TX not fit well, the case it's too small."
3,"not bad, lens quality isn't great","I use them in my work shop and outside for landscaping. They're light, comfortable, decent looking. The only problem is the lens quality. It's not all that great, they warp your vision, especially when working around the yard and walking back and forth when your eyes are constanty adjusting your focal length. They're not good for heavy-duty sawing/sanding...they obviously don't seal tightly to your face so sawdust and debris can get around them pretty freely.Overall not bad, inexpensive."
1,Not a Tim Burton Movie,"We Purchased this movie for are dental office as something to show kids in the office or when we go to the local schools. We will start with the fact that we where under the impression it was going to be a animated movie well it wasn't. The movie was just tacky very, very tacky. When the lady started talking about brushing there's this creepy guy popping in and out brushing his hair with a tooth brush. The villain of the whole thing was just scary where showing this to 1st and 2nd graders. I won't even start on the music video at the end. This video was very bad and the Assistants in the office who dared show it to their kids didn't get the best feedback on it either .I Forgot to mention that it took us almost 3 weeks to get it when we asked for it within a week. In closing if you're looking for a movie to scare or just hear kids complain this is the movie for you."
2,What happened here?...,"I must agree with doomsdayer520 & ""David Smith""...Their reviews basically say it all...Sparta need to quit redefining and find their soul within...This is a band that has the capability to say something,but they haven't said it yet...Until next time..."
3,Porcelain is still my favorite,"I liked wiretap scars enough. it is definitely jolting and energetic, but it's nowhere near as deep as porcelain. Although the lyrics on porcelain were awkward sometimes, I still believe it is the stronger of te first 2 releases. This release will hopefully grow on me. I like the first 5 or 6 songs and from there it has a few interesting moments. It really saddens me to say that I purchased the new My Chemical Romance the same day and like it more. I thought that would be an occasional casual listen, but it exceeds this album in creative changes. (I'm not emo by any means, but I think MCR's energy and lead guitar makes them stand out) I hope this is astepping stone for Sparta to a better place."
4,I liked where they were and I really like where they are now.,"Sparta was always my favorite part of the split between At the Drive-In, personally I could barely listen to Mars Volta past their first album. Sparta on Wiretap Scars sounded similar to At the Drive-in, but drifted further away as albums progressed. I always liked Denali and Engine Down and Keeley Davis's presence can really be heard on songs like ""unstich your mouth"" which is my favorite on the album. Honestly, though the album is far slower than anything done before, and there are quite obvious comparisons to bands such as U2, so it seems this band has progressed far beyond their years in At the drive-in, which to many people might not be a good thing, but I for one enjoy it!"
2,Thoroughly Disappointing,"I don't typically write reviews for items, but I feel very strongly about this album. I first experienced Sparta live when they opened for Weezer in 2002, and after picking up Wiretap Scars I was hooked. The layering of songs as well as the aggressive vocals and guitars gave Sparta a unique sound that was full of energy.Although I felt that Porecelain was below the par of Wiretap Scars, I still enjoyed it as an album. All the elements that made Sparta such a great and unique band have been wiped away for Threes. Like others before me have said, this record feels extremely disorganized. Maybe Sparta is attempting to take a new direction, but it seems as if they've completely lost their voice. If you enjoyed Wiretap Scars and Porcelain, Threes will leave you with a sour taste, and wondering where Sparta went"
4,"Natalie At Her Vocal Best--Peabo's OK, too.","For me, Natalie Cole is one of the most under rated song writers ever. On ""We're the Best of Friends"" Miss Cole proves her vocal prowess and songwriting skills on tracks such as ""Gimme Some Time"" and the outstanding ""Your Lonely Heart"". She even yodels on ""Your Lonely Heart"" combining country, pop, and R&B in a seamless duet with Mr. Bryson. Natalie displays her top-notch vocal chops on the R&B classic ""What You Won't Do For Love"", the stand-out track on this album. Her voice swoops and swerves over a jazz influenced track, making her performance comparable with Barbra Streisand or jazz greats Sarah Vaughn or Ella Fitzgerald. All in all, ""We're the Best of Friends"" is a classic, mellow album with fine production and excellent vocal performances from Natalie Cole. Peabo's OK, too. I forgot to mention the excellent ""Let's Fall in Love/ You Send Me."""
3,Trap Works Well but ...,"The trap works well but the odor is overwhelming. I used to drive a truck for FedEx Ground in the Northeast, and each autumn the sporting goods stores would get shipments of fox urine and deer urine. Even though the urine was in sealed plastic containers, the odor was revolting and it always stunk up the truck really bad for days. These traps smell just like the urine shipments; no wonder the flies love them. You will need a big backyard for this one, and you'll want to put it as far away from your house as possible. When I finally took the trap down for disposal, I was gagging so violently from the smell that I almost lost it. By this time, though, the smell had mutated into something unspeakable. Be forewarned."
4,Works As Advertised But Stinks and Is Unsightly,"Product does its job very well...attracts hordes of flies for 1 a one-way trip to their final resting place. Depending on conditions this thing can fill very fast. You mix the included fly bait with water in the plastic recepticle and then hang it somewhere and marvel over the course of days as this thing fills up with flies and other flying critters. The bait smells foul, but that's how it attracts flies, so don't place it too close to where you would eat outside or have company because a bag full of dead flies is not something you want to look at...and before actually going inside the trap the flies may circle the trap for a long time, so placement is key to where it is not too intrusive"
3,Fly trapper,I purchased 2 flies be gone one is working great in my yard the other broke when I added the water.
5,"akukla, Brooklyn, MI","This is the best fly trap I have ever seen. ACO used to carry it but stopped. Don't know why when it works so well! We have to change it every week it gets so full of flies. Once you hang it up, wait a couple of days and you will be amazed at how many flys are in this trap!"
3,Just OK,"They are comfortable, made acceptably well for the price. The sound quality is just OK - far from audiophile, even if they have a 20-20000 rating. Do not drive the bass or they distort terribly around 125hz; the highs are acceptable, but also distort if you drive hard at 8000 hz. In all fairness, they are easy to listen to at normal levels."
1,Crap,"This item fell apart the week after I got it. I'm using the regular cheap one you can buy anywhere, and I've had no problems. Could have been a fluke."
2,Comfortable grip on very low quality hole punch,"Incredibly unimpressed with the quality of this hole punch. Admittedly, I was looking to punch holes in an Altoids mint tin, but these things didn't hold up at all. They deformed from hand strength alone. I'd return the item but it's nearly unrecognizable after I vented my frustration."
4,Hurray for Remix,"Placebo has always been great at mixing up their music. they play hard, soft but never have i ever heard a dance song by them. well it has arrived. passive agressive has been made over from a sweet song to a dance song. this transformation is truly amazing and a must here for all placebo fans. as for slave to the wage remix...ehhh frankly i've heard better. but all around this single is great and a must have for any placebo fan."
2,Gospel Music,I was a little disappointed in the WOW 2009. It used some of the same artist as shown in WOW 2008.
1,Wont hold a charge long,I have purchased multiple sets of these batteries - they're Duracell - what could go wrong - right? WRONG. I have tried recharging these batteries in multiple chargers and they wont hold a charge for a quarter of the time any other brand of batteries I have do - including batteries I have had for over 5 years and have been recharged hundreds of times. I would not recommend.
5,Long Lasting. They hold charge when stored.,I am adding to my supply of these batteries. I currently use the Duracell 15 minute charger. I use these for my wireless keyboard and mouse with great success. I also use them in my Fuji digital camera that has a micro drive. They offer great life and they hold a charge when stored.I also use them in remotes and other items. My experience with these have been nothing but positive. Great price and great product.UPDATE: 12/12/2012.Still using the batteries.
1,what a waste of money,This product has tarnished the Duracell's reputation for sure. Bought a pack and they don't hold any charge. Now I got to throw them out which creates more pollution which defeat the purpose of buying these batteries in the first place.
1,First set to die,I purchased an eight pack of batteries for two Canon flashes. This product is always the first to lose the power. I have other rechargeable brands that last days longer. I don't know if I got a bad batch of these batteries or not. As it is I would never purchase this brand of rechargeable batteries again.
3,good for the price,"the were cheaper than my eneloops, but they start to fail after about twenty chargesthats all folkswho invented minimum words anyway"
2,Lasted for Maybe 15 charges,"PROs:- They worked for a while.CONs:- My charger declared these unusable after about 15 charges. (Duracell claims ""up to 1000 charges."")- The amazon listing also claims they ""last nearly 1 1/2 hours"" in a camera, which is a senseless claim.- You can get quality ""Low Self-discharge"" batteries for less cost than these self-draining batteries.- - - Alternatives - - -A much better deal would beSANYO NEW 1500 eneloop 8 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable BatteriesorAmazonBasics AA NiMH Precharged Rechargeable Batteries (8-Pack, 2000 mAh)."
2,Great music poor video production.,"You might as well buy their live CD's. Although the sound is great, the video is hazy and poor compared to The Deepest End DVD. Seems like The Deepest End is out of print but BUY IT if you can. Of course, most Mule fans are work horse fans (stubborn as Mules) if you are one of those then you'll still like this package."
4,Brazilian rhythms with delicate Italian dressing,"What do you get when you mix Brazilian samba with the arrangements of modern film music's greatest composer and innovator? The answer: extremely original, enjoyable and technically brilliant music with Latin samba rhythms. Anyone who knows the talent of Ennio Morricone and his regular crew of Roman studio musicians knows what's in store when the Italian Maestro and his Brazilian fellow musician de Hollanda join forces on this fine record. The arrangements for samba music seldom have church organs, clavicords or choirs as background accompaniment. Here they have, and the end result is just great! Morricone's musical background in classical music can be heard here, too, as he blends with popular music some of his modern classical music techniques from his seemingly bottomless arrangement trickbag. As words cannot tell what I mean, you better try to get this CD and hear for yourself."
3,Easy reading...but character worn out,"I have also read all of the Reacher novels, and the credibility is getting stretched thin. With Reacher's(Captain Shrug)ease of winning enemies he would have had his brains blown out about 3 books ago in the real world, despite his understated toughness and the authors attempts at verisimilitude. But if you totally buy into the adolescent fantasy of a totally cool and totally invulnerable tough guy (nothing wrong with that as it is FICTION) you will not be disappointed. I am pretty much burned out on the character for now."
4,Said nothing,"Great story, but I think the author used""said nothing"" to much. That phrase got a little anointing and he could have used he/she stayed silent or he/she paused. Still a great story though."
5,Child is Back,The one before this got a little boring towards the end. I'm only half way through this one but like it already.
4,"A good book,","I think Lee Child is changing Reacher to be a better fit with ""what's his name"" that is Reacher in the movie."
2,Reacher,"The writing style was choppy and more descriptive than natural story-telling. One of the few times, where I can truly say that the movie is better than the book! Watch the movie!"
4,My first book by Lee Child,Was interested to read this book before seeing the movie. The book was an entertaining page-turner and I would probably read another Lee Child book.
5,Jack Reacher Was Great!,Was a real page turner. I don't get too many of those anymore because I have too many other things on my plate. Mary
1,Save Jack Reacher!,Write your Hollywood pals. Do not let Tom Cruise play reacher in One Shot. Might as well resurrect Don Knotts.
3,A Review by Thirds,"The first-third of the novel was fairly ordinary, set-up plot. I found the second-third quite riveting though. The author has a certain cadence and style that a reader can become accustomed to...like an old episode of Dragnet. The final-third however reads like a made-for-TV movie: heroic journalist; gritty lawyer; dependale buddy; easy-to-kill bad guys, etc.I don't know. If you're heading for the beach, this may entertain you but you'll be hard-pressed to remember a word of this book two days later. I agree with the previous reviewer though...the endlessly repeated phrase ""Reacher said nothing"" becomes maddening."
4,A brilliant dose of testosterone,"This is my second Jack Reacher novel and again it delivered what I wanted. Just as Jack loves his coffee, so reading about him is like a caffeine high. I'm so impressed with how the author manages to go into such descriptive detail and yet lose none of the pace. Good stuff."
4,Good book,I almost did not read this. Tom cruise will never BE Reacher. The cover picture was a real turnoff. The book is excellent if you can get past the picture.
4,Better than the Movie,"This was my first intro to Jack Reacher. I read it out of order in order to have a little knowledge before seeing it in Theaters. While the move was OK, the book was better and had me interested enough to go back and start reading the series from the beginning. Good pace and action and a was really well written."
4,Enjoyable fast action,I really liked my first Lee Child book and will definitely buy more. Well written without pauses in the action.
4,Kill Shot,"Five average citizens are mowed down on a sidewalk by a shooter, and the investigation leads to the quick arrest of a retired Army sniper. It appears to be a slam dunk until the suspect asks for Jack Reacher.ONE SHOT has everything that fans of this terrific series have come to expect: a sensational premise, techni-colorful characters, specific settings, a complicated storyline and a strong and bloody climax.There are some bumps in the road here. A female Brigadier General shows up just long enough for a gratuitous sex scene, for instance. And crime/action junkies will get way out in front of plot to easily identify the ""Mr. Big"" who's pulling the levers.Nonetheless, the bad guys are utterly terrifying here and Reacher continues to fascinate. It's easy to recommend this book based on the unique premise alone."
5,SAW THE MOVIE PRE RELEASE LAST NITE!!,"I SAW THE PREVIE LAST NIGHT, GREAT MOVIE, the shooouts etc. are top notch, but tom cruise is NO JACK REACHER, the movie loosley follows the book of course, the audio is many times as long as the movie, so there are some consolodations, and there are many camera trix to make TC look taller than his midget self, the wisecracks are GREAT, LOL , Great car chases, and DuVall is his usual experienced self, thank god he's in it!"
3,Repeat,"Same as otherReacher novels but different story. Still good page turner mindless entertainment, and an easy read. I'll go to the movie, but Tom Cruise is not a credible Reacher."
4,Cunning,"As always, the book is exciting, cunning and well thought through and keeps your interest going. You just want to keep on reading - it keeps you on your toes."
2,love Reacher but...,"this was a little slow. All talk talk talk. No action until the end. It wasn't Mr. Child's best effort, in my opinion. that in no way implies that I won't read the next one, because I'll always by a Reacher book, but I'd get this one from the library."
4,Another great read by Lee Child on Jack Reacher,This story begins when a sniper methodically kills five office workers with six quick shots and then disappears. An old acquaintance of Reachers ask for him to be brought into the investigation. Really strange when Reacher is an old enemy of the accused. Hard action and plenty of suspense. A great read.
4,Always Dependable,"Lee Child may be the most dependable writer working the mystery/suspense scene. While ONE SHOT may not be his best, it is very, very good, and remember--Lee Child's next best is way ahead of the rest of the pack. I am always impressed by this native of Cumbria's ability to nail the American landscape. He can do the desert southwest or coastal Maine. This time out Jack is in Indiana.The 'mystery' is not deep or convoluted and the plot is not complex and deeply imagined, but the story is crisp, the characters are interesting, and there are no wasted words. As always, one simply cannot stop reading once one has started. Lee Child owes his entire readership a good night's sleep and we all owe him our thanks for delivering so dependably."
4,Very entertaining read,"Not what I expected, but a very good read. I will try other Lee Child books.More thinking and intrigue than action."
3,Adequate,This was rather slow and predictable. There are so many wonderful mystery/thrillers that this would not be one of my recommendations.
5,Reacher alone and deadly,"I am now a true believer of one man's justice. Never truly alone, just thinking that way. Amazing series. I'm ready to start the next book."
4,"lee Reacher, One Shot","Typical Jack Reacher story, a lot of action. Not one of his best but definitely worth a read. I would recommend it."
4,One shot is all it takes,"Great story, fast paced with a charachter like Jack Reacher, who follows a code of conduct which sets him apart. I was looking for a fictional mystery/thriller when I ran across this book and enjoyed the fast action, storyline and especially the charachter. I highly recommend this book."
4,"Way Over the Top, But Still Addictive","Don't know why I enjoy the Reacher books so much. They're almost a parody of the genre...a maverick who wanders and buys new clothes in each town he visits...Plot turns that are way too outrageous...Amateurs willingly risking their lives to do things that in real life only Delta Force operators would attempt...a hero who does things even Superman wouldn't attempt... STILL,I can't put the books down. I shake my head at the audacity of Child and the outrageous plots and characters and just keep reading. Am I just a sucker for shallow thrillers or is Child a much better writer than he seems? Probably both. Anyhow, call me crazy, but he gets four stars from me."
4,LET'S SHOOT SOME MORE BAD GUYS,I HAVE READ ALL 14 or 15 Jack Reacher books. This is my second time through them ... Steinbeck they are not but good stories they are. Everyday life is full of injustice and power plays at all levels of life. The whole premise of good and evil is sharp and clear cut in Teacher's world ... true escapism. Child writing is crisp and clean - fast moving. Worth the time I invest.
5,By far the Best!,"I started out with the first Jack Reacher book by Lee Child intending to work my way through all of them. When I got to ""One Shot"", I thought, ""Wow! This is the best one yet!"" I can see why they made a movie out of it! And I haven't seen the movie yet! Now I can't wait to see it!"
3,Why Tom Cruise!,This would have been a better novel if Tom Cruise hadn't played Jack Reacher in the movie. Now I just see him and he just isn't Jack Reacher. The book didn't seem to be as good as some of the other JR novels by Lee Child.
3,Short - One Shot,"Typical Reacher adventure but over before it began. No dull down time but I couldn'tbelieve how quick I was done. There should be a warning that it was a ""Short"" story."
4,Very solid,Thought it was one of the better Reacher novels I've read. Well worth reading for reacher fans out there. Boom.
3,FormZ Modeling-forces you to learn.,A new user to FormZ I was stuggling to find a way to alleviate the stress of such a high learning curve. This book helps in more of an indirect way then I had expected. The tutorials are relativly well written but are difficult to reproduce. I found myself banging my head against the wall trying to figure out what I had done wrong. When I did figure it out I did learn but only after hours of frustration. If you are a new user be prepared for some long hours.
4,The chemistry works,"I don't understand why the critics slammed this movie so hard. Granted, the framing plot with the two evil angels is really, really stupid. But I can ignore that because the give-and-take between Ewan McGregor and Cameron Diaz is so funny, so charming, so perfectly acted. They work so well together, with Diaz as the spoiled-brat rich girl and McGregor is a sweet guy so bumbling he doesn't even know how to commit a crime properly and Diaz has to teach him. And check out the song-and-dance number where McGregor turns into a Broadway showman! The soundtrack music is great, too, especially R.E.M.'s ""Leave."" When I rented this movie last summer, I loved it so much I watched it four times in three days. I finally got my own copy for Christmas, and now I can watch it as much as I want. I suggest you add it to your video collection, too, so you can pull it off the shelf whenever you want to watch a fun, romantic comedy."
2,Strange...,"What a weird weird movie. The chemistry between Ewan McGregor and Cameron Diaz really works, but the movie's plot line is just horrid. It's pointless and I couldn't keep myself glued to the t.v. for however long this movie is. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, unless they don't have something better to do."
2,Cool unit for voice recording but the sound is sub-par,I bought this based on reviews here and elsewhere. I can justify the cost because the unit accepts an external micorphone-- something I need since I do a lot of interviewing. The voice recording quality is excellent. Not quite as good as my Sony MD recorder but then I don't have to up load my files in real time. But for music... this is a very weak player. I tested with four different kinds of head phones including the supplied ear buds. No matter how I adjusted the sound controls the tone is either flat or excessively tinny to the point that it hurts. For $195 with tax this is probably going to go back to the store. I'll try the iRiver next.
4,Another great book from Zoe Sharp,"Hard Knocks is the third book in the Charlie Fox series. Charlie (Charlene) is ex-special forces...British. She is smart and tough. This book has great action, a believable plot, and a bit of romance.Because the first three books are out of print, they are somewhat hard to acquire. But don't give up. You can find them! The price range is pretty wide, so shop around.Here are the books: Killer Instinct, Riot Act, Hard Knocks, Road Kill, First Drop, Second Shot."
5,"great read, good lead character","main characters are good, and the lead female, is strong and takes care of herself, she is not wimpy! she infiltrates a supposed german personal bodyguard training school to find out why a friend was murdered....its very interesting and a fast read. Good action and adventure. Even my husband liked it."
1,Did somebody run out of rejection form letters?,"This book has no real content to speak of, but I'd rate it only one star were its contents comparable to that of Einstein's general and special relativity papers. Why? Because the quality of its writing is simply abysmal. This is a book that can't even summarize a Star Trek episode without tripping over its own prose (I'm talking about a simple, non-tech episode from the original sixties series) and wants to explain to you quantum mechanics. My recommendation? Read a comic book instead--any comic book."
2,"Poor writing, structure obscures cool ideas","Wolf's problem, demonstrated again and again in ""Parallel Universes"" and his other books, is that he is a mediocre writer. Provocative, often fascinating ideas fizzle and die in the midst of Wolf's rambling, often barely coherent sentences. He offers speculation as fact -- for example, repeatedly claiming, in no uncertain terms, that quantum physics and relativity both ""prove"" that parallel universes really exist; most of us know that the idea of parallel universes is a theory, and a controversial one at that, popular strictly among the minority of physicists. And, in presenting difficult geometrical concepts (right triangles plastered onto a sphere, geodesics on a sphere, etc.), he doesn't offer A SINGLE ILLUSTRATION to make his points. The reader is left to grapple with geometry solely through the printed word -- and in poorly chosen words, to boot. Where is Stephen Hawking when you need him?"
4,Good read,Good read if you enjoy history and African hunting adventure stories. I would recommend this book to friends. Check it out . If you like this book read Samuel White Baker.
3,Cool,"This one is a cool item, and the sound is stuning... Maybe the cover is not the best... the picture seems stretched, but stiil a good item for a collector"
1,SCARIEST METAL EVER,This band is a horror srceaming acting like there going to die GET ME A BREAK THOSE GUYS ARE SCARIEST!!!!!
1,Not what you expect,"I saw the movie first and loved it, then went out bought the book and read it. Hated the book!!!! It was nothing like the movie, relationships that you thought would be described better in the book did not even exist! If you have seen the movie and love it don't read the book it will ruin your experience. However, if you have not yet seen the movie then you will probablly enjoy the book."
4,Selfishness vs Selflessness,"Maugham created a marked contrast between the self-centeredness of the main character Kitty and the self sacrifice of both her husband and a group of French nuns working in a cholera ravaged city in China. The story revolves around Kitty and her moral dilemmas as she engages in an affair with a shallow self absorbed man that brings her own short comings into full relief. Her husband Walter Fane while initially seeming dry and uninteresting through her eyes, becomes the true hero of this novel as he tirelessly sacrifices on behalf of the local community.Maugham is always interesting and in The Painted Veil he provides a morality tale that is deeply effecting and well worth reading."
4,Perfect small shaker,This is a good size to shake yourself a drink. The top has a rubber lining that seals well so there isn't any leaking. The shape is appealing and the quality appears to be good. You can't go wrong.
3,Another dup,"This DVD is of the same quality as I have found on the other Second Chorus DVDs I have purchased....fair. I have 3 different DVDs of this movie. All the versions of this film I have seen are dupes of a poor quality original. All are a little dark, have faded quality and on one DVD the sound was poor. If there is a restored version of this movie out there somewhere, it is a secret."
3,"Not Bad, but defineatly not his best","This movie was an interesting one. I've always liked Fred Astaire in anything he did, but this one was not so good. Paulette Goddard co-stars as a business manager for Artie Shaw (Artie Shaw is in most of the movie)and Fred is trying to get to play his trumpet in with Artie's band or he just wants to play anywhere. Burgess Meredith, who I also like plays Fred's room mate, and he too is trying to play and be discovered by somebody important. Even though this movie has some great stars, and even though this movie has some very funny scenes the whole movie is pretty bad in general."
5,She proved she was no fluke with this release,"I became a Natalie Cole fan due to this album. This album had everything, but the song that sold me on Natalie's talents was 'No Plans For the Future'. Her range impressed me. Her power and phrasing went straight to the heart. This women could really sing. ""God Bless The Child"" is another great tune. 'Keep Smiling"" takes you to church and leaves you there for a while. Another must have for the true Natalie fan."
3,A little boring for adults,There is not as much strategy as I thought there would be. A lot of rules to learn before playing. Once you've got that all under your belt the play is fairly easy. There is more luck than strategy involved.
3,Just okay...hard to get into,"This book was just okay and the beginning was hard for me to get into. I'm wondering if it was a translated book? I found it to be similar to ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" in terms of hard to connect. Once I got through the beginning it was easier to stay focused but I had a couple of chapters where I was forced to reread."
4,Henning Markell,"If you love mystery books, then you should grab this one. I am a big Henning markell fan -- especially his Kurt Wallander series. This one of his finest and I highly recommend it. Good summer reading."
5,One step behind,Henning Mankell really nails you to your reading chair from page one with his subtle and quiet horror stories where there is a minimum of the graphical violence you so often see in American thrillers these days. Mankell has an ingenius way of building up his stories which will keep you mystified till the end. He is also weaving into the fabric a honest description of Sweden on the social level and of how police work is developing in the Scandinavian countries. You get to like this Wallander and his Swedish colleagues so much that you are sad when the last page is turned.
2,Atticus and his team are lousy bodyguards,"I must agree with the reader from Carpinteria, CA. I would not want these people protecting me. Why would a professional team take a job when the principal's father won't give them any info about the nature of the danger? Since one set of killers already know where he lives, why move Erika there? The list of implausibilities goes on and on."
4,An Intimate Illustration of Terry Fox,"This book gives a close look at Terry Fox, his life, and his humanity. It shows his accomplishments as a wheelchair basketball athlete and gives a peek at two pages of his diary. It shows what it was like to be with Terry during his Marathon of Hope, right down to the sunburn on the left side of his freckled face. It is a treasure of intimacy, the best thing next to have known Terry in this life. I was very pleased with this look at life with the Foxes and how really down-to-earth they are."
1,LONG BORING NOVEL = SHORT MOVIE THAT BOMBED,"Chris O'Donnell, Gene Hackman, Faye Dunaway star in this terrible boring movie based on John Grisham's novel.O'Donnell stars as idealistic young attorney Adam Hall who takes on the death row clemency case of his onetime klansman grandfather, Sam Cayhall (Hackman). With just 28 days before the execution, Adam sets out to retrace the events leading to the crime for which Sam was convicted. As the impending death sentence looms closer, Adam works quickly to uncover the family's history for any - hidden clues.There is a serious problem with the book and movie, the book is long and so boring and it's sad to say a bestseller. The movie is short and a obvious bomb. Usually John Grisham books are great, thrilling suspensful fun. While John Grisham's movies are long and good, there at least 150 minutes this one was 1 hour and 53 minutes. What happend here? I'll tell you a lousy novel equals a lousy movie."
3,not the best,This movie is about a young lawer trying to get his gramd father out of prison. The grandfather is on death row. In the end ol' grandfather gets gassed. Groos this movie was mot to great but the acting and bachgrounds were great. The plot was the worst ever.
2,Read it? Don't watch it...,"While John Grisham writes extremely good books in which The Chamber is one of...this movie was just pathetic. The storyline of the book was chopped up and murdered. You dont see the changes that Gene Hackman goes through in the movie...one minute he's a KKK advocate and the next he's loving minorities. I have heard from people that haven't read the book that it was a good movie, but this movie is not worth it if you have read it. With the big names in this film...the story line should have been written to FOLLOW THE BOOK!"
5,Illinois & Kentucky & Arizona & New Mexico& Oklahoma,This series has been a great read for me. I am a history buff and this is history that makes you read all night.
2,PalmM500,It was confusing and there were no instructions to be found. I usw it but wish I had eturned it for a full refund.
1,"Same Experience as Electronics fan from Chandler, AZ","Buyer Beware!!!! My unit no longer hot syncs either! After getting 3 Refurbished units, one new 500, one new cradle and HOURS on the phone to Palm, I found out there is an electrical static problem with this unit (and most of the other Palm products, except the new one)!!!! There is a ""patch"" that was just written but it is NOT a FIX. I FINALLY got a great technician (at the corporate office) that explained that the only way to fix it was to get a serial port cradle....."
1,The Palm....,"So much for this item - my original pda was a Palm m500. I loved it! But, after using it for several years, it crashed. I then went to a Tungsten E2 - nice machine, but that is no longer working. I decided to buy another Palm m500 as I din't need all of the bells and whistles the the E2 had. Little did I know that I had to buy extras so that the 500 would sync to my computer. I purchased the recommended equipment and contacted the seller for further instructions. I was e-mailed the instructions for the 'newest software' that would be compatible with my computer. I have followed the instructions to the letter. My pc appreciates the infrared da, accepts the palm software, but will not sync. I am frustrated and angry not only for the waste of money, but also my time."
