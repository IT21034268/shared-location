1,Very disappointing,"I was sold on this machine because of the apparent ease of use and the decorative stitches. While it is easy to use, that matters very little as the tension is constantly messed up. The adjusting dial doesn't work. The tension stays the same no matter what the setting, and the top thread easily pulls out. Unfortunatly, I am just past the window of return. I am back to my 25 year old Kenmore."
4,You'll be begging for another ride!,"From the opening jam of Superstation, this cd snagged me. Honestly, it didn't even need that. Years ago, I recieved a cd in the mail from Coke when they launched their Surge soda.The cd was better than the soda by far. One of the tracks it included was from Stir. I picked up their cd, and subsequently, got Holy Dogs when it came out. One track, New Beginning, got some actual airplay here in Oregon. I don't know about the rest of the country. This is one of those bands that i just don't understand how they did not catch on.The cd holds on solidly from start to end. This is a cd for people who like modern rock music. If you like Goo Goo Dolls and the like, you will dig this."
1,I wish they would quit playing there single.,This music is produced so well that you might not notice the lack of music creativity and awful lyrics that are behind it. Dont be fooled. Obviously a mastermind of the industry to feed the masses.
4,"Decent price, does the job",These work much better than the ni-cad batteries I replaced. They hold a charge for almost a week if I keep the phone off the cradle (just wanted to find out!). Day to day use and replacing on the cradle and you forget about these. Hats off to a battery that works so well you can take it for granted.
4,Wonderful!,"What a wonderful piece of literature. Very thought provoking and in it's short form, it's very, very good and well written."
1,More of a Prose of the Intellect of the Writer,"The author Thomas Carlyle presents the history of the French Revolution as a prophetic poetry of his intellect, and rightfully burned on his presentation for review. As reading this book realize the great store of words and meanings that suited his direction rather than the true nature of the French Revolution of the peoples. What an awful book!"
1,JAMES JOYCE STYLE WORD SALAD.,"I know where James Joyce stole his schizophrenic word-salad style of writing. I know why John Stuart Mill burned it. Its a mess, and on its way to the Saint Pia Zadora Thrift Shoppe."
4,The best Footy game ever!,"This game will be the best soccer game ever. It will be even better than Winning Eleven 7. It has over 51 national teams and a variety of game modes example Situation,Euro,Fantasy,Training etc. It has newer and better skill mover then ever before eg. chip shots,nutmengs,bicycle kicks and a lot more. EA SPORTS have made an excellent show after the very disappointing FIFA 2004. This is a must have for any Soccer fan.I will buy it on the very first day of its release and probably you will too.You can get more details on its official site ""www.euro2004game.ea.com""."
5,Eye-opening history,"History can be more dramatic and more exciting than fiction and this is an excellent example. I couldn't put this down and I came away with a deeper understanding of the end of the Third Reich, Stalin's role, and a sense of the experience of civilians in Germany and Poland in those crucial and horrible weeks."
4,Berlin - the Downfall,"Graphic, I could only read this book insmall doses. Most of these atrocities happened in my year of birth and it has taken me 68 years to discover the truth of this sad series of events in Human History. We express shock and horror on current day atrocities but these pale into insignificance on what was absolute horror for non- combatants of all ages, women in particular and innocent childen. Human beings are supposed to be superior animals but not even animals would behave like this."
5,Perfect,"If you want Debussey's piano preludes, and you want them played perfectly, then this is for you. It's a terrific after dinner album, of durring a nice bath.This disk won: The Grammophone Award in the UK The Diapason d'Or in France The Prix de l'Academie de disque francais, also in France.To quote Gramophone magazine, ""The difinitive version and an outstanding issue. Neither the playing nor the recording can be faulted."" I couldn't agree more."
3,Awesome Show on bluray not in hd,"well i got mines today on release date. i was so excited to get home and watch it, now i seen this anime over and over again about a good 100 times, clearly i'm a fan but when I popped this in my ps3 and saw 2 black bars on the sides and the quality still the same as the dvd or television version, i was a little let down. It's nice that it's been re-released and for and affordable price, but it is in no way hd, i mean it doesn't have 5.1 channel audio support and it only looks a tad better, mean meaning extremely small difference, now if you haven't seen the anime then this would be a great thing for you, but if you watched it as much as i did you can just get the dvd"
3,"True to Source Material, Anyway","The original FLCL was 'shot' on 16mm film in a fixed 4:3 aspect ratio. What this means is: this Blu-ray is not widescreen, and it is not really in HD. Can't really get HD from 16mm film.The transfer and colors are all fine, but, technically, you can't do better than DVD-quality. Sucks, but that's just how FLCL was made."
5,best anime ever,"i only watch subbed anime - except for FLCL. trying to follow the action & read subtitles would be hopeless. and unlike 99% of anime dubs, the actors in FLCL seem to have a clue about how anime works. i love this show."
1,Just Not Funny,"This show seemed to make me want to laugh but nothing came out. Watch Magical Shopping Arcade if you want to laugh, and watch FLCL if you want to see an anime that proves the stereotype correct, people watch anime just because it is anime."
5,WOOHOO!,"if one has never seen this anime, do it. this is an order. this anime is probably the best ever. i am watching you. also it looks really good on blu-ray"
5,FLCL is simply amazing!,"From the first time I saw FLCL on Adult Swim almost 8 or 9 years ago I knew I had to own it. I waited and saw the Blu-Ray a few months back and ordered it. Everything looks crisp and clean compared to the DVD set I borrowed from a friend a few years back.Amazon lists the Blu-Ray as widescreen, it is not widescreen. I looked over the menu trying to see if there was an option to change it but there wasn't one. Although the Pillows video is in widescreen, odd.FLCL totally changed the way I looked at anime with it's wacky story and animation style. Do yourself a favor and pick this up."
5,great come back,"this record was a great come back or reunionfor ufo,the songs rock,like self made man,youcan't get any better than that,the records afterward,by ufo were good,but walk on water was the best withthe original line up,like the first montrose album,thisone rates as the best one in the 90s and 2000s."
4,Phil,"""Walk on Water"" is a great comeback album for what I believe to be one of the greatest rock bands in the world. I rate it a 4 because it doesn't come close to ""Force It"", ""Obsession"" or ""Lights Out""--albums where Michael Schenker shows his incredible prowess on guitar, alternating between aggressive and subtle notes and chords. Schenker sounds good on this album as it harkens back to the great days of UFO. Buy it!"
5,UFO Rocks on this one!,"One of the hardest rocking bands of the 70's proves they can still rock well into the late 90's. Re-uniting the classic lineup of the 70's, including the legendary Michael Schenker, UFO has one of their best efforts in 'Walk On Water.' From the opening chords, Schenker sets the tone of what is to be a hard-rocking album from start to finish.Highlights of the album are the tracks 'Venus' and 'Running on Empty', which features a beautiful acoustic solo, and numerous electric solos. Great album, highly recommend!!"
4,the boys are back and better than ever!!!!!!,"when this album came out i was scared to death to play it. i've been a ufo fan forever and did'nt want this to be bad. i was very very happy when i finally got the courage to play it. it is the best rock&roll album of the 90's. if you're young or just don't know about ufo buy this, turn it up and have a blast. p.s. michael schenker never played with the scorpions ( that was his brother )"
4,"Great ""comeback""","This is Ufo's ""comeback album"" -95 (their best/famous members, M.Schenker etc.).Good purchase.(this release contains 3 bonus track)Tracks are very good, bears comparison with their best works.Booklet is as poor as possible."
5,Best of Reunion Albums,"This is by far the best of the reunion albums. Sounds Great!. Mogg and Schenker are at the top of their games here. Only problem is it's to short on original material. Later releases ""Convenent"" and ""Sharks"" start going downhill along with Schenker's attitude."
3,Decent tone bar,"A good tone bar for the price. The finish is OK and the tone is bright and brassy on my Fender Deluxe 6 steel guitar. My main objection is the weight, a little too heavy for my style of playing. I currently use a ceramic tonebar from Jay Seibert and recommend it highly."
1,Get an old 1980s Atari before buying this sorry game,I hope J McGrath enjoys the money he got for this hunk of junk. This is truely one of the worst games I have ever seen. The graphics are horrible. The music and effects are horrible. I will never buy another Acclaim game. Oy VAY what a load this game is.
1,McGrath vs. Carmichael,"McGrath should be utterly embarrassed to have his name associated with this lame offering. Even with the advantage of knowing its competition (RC MX2002), Acclaim has produced a major dud. The bikes aren't real, the sounds aren't real, the graphics are horrible. Stick with the RC MX2002 for an awesome MX game. Shame on you Jeremy..."
1,"beware disc one needs to be replaced, bad transfer.","i love the show dont get me wrong with one star, its not the show that gets the one star rating but the product itself. BCI has done it again with the bad transfering. disc one episode three around the mid of the 15 minute mark the episode skips and freezes. its nothing on the disc itself no residue or scratches. just bad data transfering. i would believe all of the dvd sets are like this. now i have to find a way of getting it replaced."
3,Where to start on this inept film???,"Do you like bad,but fun movies?? How about bad editing?? Big rubber snakes?? An Octopus in the swamp??? Care to see a Bela Lugosi double wearing platform shoes??...Well,this is the movie to get if you like to watch on a rainy night(or however)and don't have anything else better to do.Maybe make a drinking game out of it for every mistake you see...Ed Wood is NOT the worst director(Coleman Francis is!),but at least he could do with what he could afford(or not),if you look at it that way......If you'd care to see MST3K do this,then find out on their website(tape trading section)---it's a hoot!! Very funny indeed!!....."
5,BELA LIVES!,"Irresistible Monogram film. At the top of the list of movies that qualify for genre So-bad-that's-it's-good. Poverty Row films were filmed in 2-5 days with cardboard sets, wierd music (if any), preposterous plots, bad acting by actors required to wear their own clothes instead of being supplied with costumes, etc..Bela is known for appearing in about 10 of these amusingly ghastly films. However--Lugosi always gave it his All, no matter how dreadful the script or working conditions. He never dissapoints; he never ""walked through"" a role. One of the true Immortals..."
4,Very nice,I like the tale a lot; is a simple story but with a lot of wisdom. Also this edition has very nice ilustrations and references that makes the book more entertaining
5,Darling movie with some good lessons to learn.,"If you like horses/ponies you may enjoy Ride A Wild Pony. Cute movie made in Australia, during a little different era. Good lessons learned for kids AND adults. Could easily provoke discussion on several different levels with children about personalities, being handicapped, civility, ownership and friendship. Beautiful ponies! I love the fact that the pony is ridden and DRIVEN! All ponies should be so versatile! This movie may not be 'professionally polished' (with the main pony character changing). But I still enjoyed this movie as a youngster and again now that I have bought it to own."
4,Good CD,arrived in relatively prompt deliverythey ship from south america like its coming from chicago
5,The Great Sinatra,This is the good stuff. Great orchestrations and Sinatra responds with enthusiasm; he's into it!
2,Not fun to read,"I'm largely a ""philosophy beginner"". I stopped reading after having labored thru approximately 1/2 the book. I don't know if it's the nature of the subject matter, or, the book/writing/organization itself. Also, the somewhat fuzzy, thick font style wasn't pleasant either. Basically, each chapter---as far as I got---consists of naming a philosopher, a paragraph or so explanation of what he thought about that area of philosophy, followed by the same type of exposition for each successive philosopher, one after another, until the end of that chapter. It wasn't very interesting or enjoyable, and I enjoy reading this type of stuff. Much of the explanation (perhaps in part due to the subject matter) was vague, unmemorable, dry, and uninteresting. I felt that, if I were to finish the entire book, a month later I would be unable to answer almost any questioin one might ask about what I read. Maybe it's just me, but I was disappointed with this particular purchase."
5,the BEST philo. overview (nutshell),"i've used this book throughout my philosophy education, and it is the best nutshell you can get on virtually every major western Philosopher. not a replacement for org. writings, but a great ""basics"" to give understanding to what you are studying."
5,Thanks Lori!!!!!!!!!,I purchased this book when I found out I was going to be moving to the West Seattle area. I wanted to get acquainted with my new neighborhood and after reading it I can hardly wait. Lori's West Seattle sounds like a great place to call home.
4,Good start to wonderful music to come,"Structures is Kotebel's first and least interesting CD. He adds more instrumentation and additional musicians with each of the following two CD's. This CD reminds me of Rick Wakeman's recent output or some of Tomas Bodin - nice but I need more. Lyrical ideas are developed within the totally instrumental framework, but there is a sameness to the orchestrations. Kotebel's ""Fragments of Light"" (2004) is not to be missed."
4,Great Game,"This Game is Great i think its got good graphics and really cool guns and best of all,you have Voodo Power. The Grigori (which are what the bosses are called) are really hard to beat, but all other enimeis are really weak.Anyway, i think this game is alot like Devil May Cry but not as good."
3,A rare look inside an elite military intelligence unit,"Rob Lewis is the pseudonym of a case officer who served in an ultra secret military intelligence unit, known as the Force Research Unit, in northern Ireland. He describes the selection, training of this unit as well as the methodology that it employed in Ulster to spot, recruit and run agents inside the IRA. Due to the secrecy restrictions imposed on him the chapters about his time in the north are a collection of bland anecdotes. If one wishes to read a book by an insider that blows the lid off of the FRU read, Stakeknife, by Martin Ingram."
3,Typical Early Tarkington,"This short novelette held much promise. I actually read the introduction and was told that this was one of the great ""love"" stories in American literature.What I got was a muddled story that was hard to follow and unfeeling. A lowly Frenchman comes to England and notices a lady in the upper class. She has noble blood. He worms his way into an introduction with her under the guise of French nobility and a made up title. She is impressed with him until he is revealed to her as a mere ""barber"".Yet he is not all that he seems to be -- as the story reveals much to the woman's regret ( after she learns the truth ).I am glad this book was short, otherwise I probably would've ditched it after page 50... but I figured I was already almost half way through and stuck with it... It started to make sense near the end but there seemed to be about 35 pages of confusion occurring."
5,Grim and Beautiful,"I first heard Dick Gaughan in an upper room in a tiny North London pub in 1985. It was hot and dark in that little room, packed full of a hushed crowd. All those people were in on a secret: Dick Gaughan. I've never forgotten the spare beauty of that night. Worker's songs, like colliary bands, are an acquired taste for Americans. I can't think of a better introduction not only to traditional agit-prop music, but to the astonishing beauty of the celtic music sensibility than Dick Gaughan, and this album in particular. He can do things with a guitar that stretch the instrument immensely. In his hands, it's a fiddle, sometimes a pipe, but always sparklingly clear. His voice is stern and honest. This is beautiful work, his Now Westlin Winds and Workers Song in particular. A good introduction to the often difficult celtic ear."
4,The title says it all,"I was quite pleasantly surprised at this gem of an album. It is a testament to the talent these great artists. I love this album, and I'm sure you will too."
1,"Tedious, just like Norah Vincent's other writing","She deploys many of the tactics written about in her poorly-written articles. In short, the book is neither witty nor particularly well-written. It might impress the pseudo-educated, but anyone with a half-decent BS-ometer will eventually embarrass the person deploying its ""tricks."""
5,"A wonderful Pandora's Box, plot-twisiting, free-for-all!!!","Another wonderful book from the mind of William Sleator. Again, his writing is clear and understandable, but his plot twists are wonderfully unexpected. For every child who has been told not to open a door, or look in a box, this book will keep you imagination reaming with posibilties long after you put the book down. A true classic in the sense that you find something new everytime you read it. So go ahead and read it."
2,Too lemony,"It has more of a lemony scent than sandalwood. The consistency is nice though, light and not greasy."
5,A Wonderful sounding CD.,"It's truly a pity that those who criticize the sound of this recording can't hear it on a high end system. It is far and away one of the best if not the best sounding Mahler 2nd in the catalogue. Definition is amazing, as is the tonal palette. And, of course the performance is wonderful. I own twelve Mahler 2nds. In every way this is the best!"
2,Avoid this recording,"The first movement is really spectacular, the middle movements are good, but unfortuanately, the final movement is incoherent and uninvolving. What should be the gem of the performance comes off as a dud."
5,"Fascinating, informative, spectacular nature video.","There are more than 165,000 different species of butterflies, each one showcasing grace and beauty. Butterfly World: Jewels Of The Sky is a 35 minute, full color video filmed on location around the globe and presents some of the most spectacular butterflies in nature. Butterflies are show laying, molting, emerging or flying. Their ingenious ways of defense, the great migration of the Monarchs, and much, much more are revealed through spectacular wildlife photography that will delight, fascinate, and inform young viewers. Butterfly World is a highly recommended addition to all school and community library video collections."
1,Don't buy this,The paint does not stick at all. Waste of money and time and very disappointing for a 5 and 7 year old and their mom who should have donated this money to WWF. We did however use the opportunity as a consumer reporting teaching lesson writing this review.
4,Just like the real event!,This game is simply awesome! It's fully realistic in every aspect of the actual rally and well worth the buy.
1,The Worst,This has to be one of the worst games ever for PS2. The controls are so sloppy it's almost impossible to control the car. After a race go have dinner the game may have reloaded by then. The clowns at Acclaim should be ashamed. What a waste...
4,why would he do this,why would chris benoit do this to his family.if he was having trouble pepole would have helped him out.iam very disappointed he murdered his wife and son.what kind of human being would kill a 7 year old kid.this is very sad.hopefully his wife and child are in a better place.my condolences.as far as benoit is concerned he now belongs to the devil himself.shame on chris shame.very disappointed.i thought he had class just like all the other canadians.he now gives them a bad name.all because he decided to be very selfish empty and a coward.rip benoit he asked for it and now he got it.overall the dvd is excellent despite what happened.
2,Benoit Legacy Destroyed,"Unfortunately you can't pick and choose what you want included in your life story, it's pretty much written by the significant actions you take. Benoit made the horrible decision to commit murder, yet people still want to glorify him as a ""wrestling hero"". It's unfortunate people will cheer his wrestling legacy..did you not see that the 2 people he murdered (wife and son) were in the very wrestling ring with him celebrating his title win at Wrestlemania?http://wwecharacters.blogspot.com"
5,An Extensive Survey of Yeats' Career,"I have yet to read through the entire book, but then again this is not the kind of book you sit down with and read page after page in order. You can, but don't have to. I have best enjoyed this book by pulling it off the shelf from time to time and reading a poem or two, mulling them over, then returning the book to the shelf. Collected works of poetry can start to bleed together when I read too many individual poems in one sitting, and the beauty of a work like this is that I can keep coming back to it and find new poetry. It's a thick, beautiful book that should be on the shelf of anyone who enjoys poetry or even for someone starting to get interested in Yeats (such as myself when I bought it). This volume will last you a long time and keep you coming back for more every time you open it up."
2,Remarkably... mediocre,"William Butler Yeats is about as bad a poet one can be and still be considered ""great"". All of his poems are earnest and sincere, but they are totally appalling in Yeats's lack of control of language. The ideas of his poems are instructive, prophetic, and occasionally moving, particularly as he grew older, but as a technical writer he was, 98% of the time, an incompetent bumbler."
1,mulberry jam,Did not realize that the jam they sent was not what i ordered. I ordered mulberry and they sent me crab apple that is why i didnt like it. too late to send back because i opened it
4,A Great resource for any climber,This book is a great book to start with. It briefly adresses most all skills in the world of rock climbing. It is well illustrated.
4,One of the best introductory climbing books around.,"John Long combines his climbing experience with his specialwriting style to give you an introduction to rock climbingthat is both useful and entertaining. The chapter on ""The Workoutfrom Hell"" is a classic."
4,What are ya'll talking about? This is a good CD!,"To the person who said he wishes he could have given this cd a ""zero"", you forgot to take your medication again Pal. Brighter Day will forever be a classic, and New Delhi, Mambo Inn, Mackin are all good too. The only weak spot is around tracks 5-8. But as a person who rarely listens to smooth jazz,and prefers the old school, I liked this album. It was my 1st Jordan one and made me appreciate jazz guitarists even more. also see Norman Brown-Celebration"
5,Brilliant! Funny! Brilliant! Funny!,"Cuppy was brilliant! He died, the poor dear, before the world realized his brilliance. ARGH! This book is hilarious! American! Satirical. Oh, you have to read it to understand! In this book he selected famous persons throughout history (Lady Godiva, Attila the Hun, Henry VII, Lucrezia Borgias, Louis 14th, Cleopatra etc) and did an amazing amount of research about their lives, and wrote about the quirky parts of their lives, I love it! Read it! Read it!"
2,A Decent Read Based on Some Historic Oddities,"Not the most well-written work but an interesting read for the novice historian. This book is organized into miniature stories of the demise of individuals commonly found in history textbooks and popluar lore. At times, Cuppy expands on the story we already know with some interesting anecdotes but he also exposes some real shockers and wonderful stories you cannot easily find elsewhere. It would have been nice to see all of the references as this book could have been a great research tool, but it ends up serving as a neat, quick read that is honestly more entertainment than scholarly. This is not necessarily to say I didn't like the book (I did), but it is obvious it was made for a specific niche market. For the average reader it may be less than engaging but for a history buff ""Decline"" is worth checking out."
4,simple enough to use,"Easy enough to use. The fact that this product comes with NO user manual whatsoever is a testament to that.Although there ARE cheaper backup solutions to your Palm, the only one I can think of at the top of my head being using a normal expansion card and specific software like BackupMan or BackupBuddyVFS ($10 to $15 compared to this product for $40 - $50), this product still has >some< practicality.Many people consider a backup card for Palm PDAs for the case that BOTH their PC AND Palm dies on them. Here are some things to consider:-If you have only one expansion card and you lose it with your PDA, you just lost all info on your handheld and card. In the rare case that you lose info backed to your PC, you're out of luck-hearing as how software only backup solutions work well, it may be worth your while to pursue a better deal if u can on this."
4,Super chesse,"This is one of those low buget movies you see on USA-up all night. I saw it on a fluk years back when I was in college. I loved it. Very cheap, but a lot of fun. Bacisly you have guys on death row givin one last chance to live if they play on a TV game show. If they win, they get to live, if not...death, but hey they get some money for there family. ""Sorry your dads dead, but here are some great parting gifts."" There are some cute bits.If you like Korny movies you'll like this one."
1,This Rack Sucks,This rack is bike specific..... You can't have a variety of diferent bicycles. Found out After the Purchase and it would have been to costly to return and the MFG offered no help..... Simple and neat in design. Would I recommend. NO WAY .... Set up for a old style 10 speed or English Racer...
3,First of all...,"How can anyone say that there were no black people on ""Friends""? Ross's girlfriend, played by Aisha Tyler, is BLACK! That means that those people clearly haven't watched the show. Also, this show is great but ""Friends"" went downhill at around season 7 (I still watched it, though). Especially in this season, the characters were too old to be acting the way they were. One episode that does stand out as funny was ""The One Where the Stripper Cries"" (with Danny DeVito as the stripper). I only bought this set to complete my ""Friends"" collection."
1,They'll always be therre for you...,"...thank god they went away. 10 seasons of proof that somne people will watch anything. Never funny, never original, never interesting. A show about people who no one in New York would want as neighbors...a show about a bunch of boring idiots for a bunch of boring idiots.(Now it's over..and the way their careers are going, we may never have to see any of them again..as soon as NBC cancels Joey..and People realizes that most of the world doesn't give a crap about a no-talent like Aniston!"
2,item condition,"I purchased used seasons of Friends from here and got them quickly after ordering them. But the packaging was flimsy and damaged. One of the sets had broken pieces in the bag. All of the sets were labeled as VERY GOOD condition. I'm not sure they all play but some have water marks on them, so does the outer box. Some of the dvd's had scratches. One of the sets had something on the box that looked like puke. YUK! VERY GOOD?? I think not. I hope they all play ok. I will never buy from Hastings again."
3,What about the Final Episode?,Remember the Series Finale DVD? It claimed to be the only place to get the broadcast version of the final episode. How will this be different?
4,Poison 'n Roll,"Man was I suprised when I got this CD. It rocks, and yes it may be their best album ever, sorry Cece. If you ever liked this band, get this now! I can not listen to it enough, the best songs on the cd (as if there were any bad ones) are ' Best Thing You Ever Had' ' Baby Gets Around A Bit' ' Sexual Thing' ' That's The Way I Like It' 'Tragically Unhip'........get this now and CRANK IT!"
4,GOOD CD,"THIS IS A VERY GOOD CD.GOOD GUITAR WORK AND OF COURSE THE SINGING OF BRET MICHAELS IS GREAT.I WAS REALY SUPRISED HOW GOOD THEY SOUNDED WITH BLUES SARACENO ON GUITAR.I GOT TO SEE THESE GUYS IN CONCERT LAST YEAR WITH RATT,AND IT WAS A GREAT SHOW,SO I`M GLAD THEY FINALLY MADE THIS CD AVALIBLE.I`M JUST HOPING THEY PUT SOMETHING NEW OUT SOON.POISON STILL ROCKIN HARD."
4,Fun music is back!,"It's about time this cd was released! Glad to hear some good ole sex tunes! No one can do it like Poison! Crank it up and enjoy!Stand outs include Sexual Thing(fast paced, in your face sex song), Lay Your Body Down(awesome ballad) and Best Thing You Ever Had(the kick off track)."
3,Finally Released!!,"After being shelved for four years, Capital Records finally releases ""Crack A Smile"". This will be Poison's final work with Capital. Certainly not Poison's best but still Poison. This edition featuring Blues Saraceno on guitar shows a more 90's oriented Poison. Still packed with some good Poison music, I don't believe this to be their best work...~Shadow~"
2,disappointed,Excited to see one of my favorite movies come out in Blue-Ray 3D. Watched it in 3D and found the 3D effects were okay but the video to be very grainy. My husband says I'm always too critical but this time he agreed with me. Didn't watch the 2D version that was included.
2,"2D blu ray great, 3D blu ray a joke","The 3D not that good and I could even live with that but the picture has the look of a Horrible DVD or worse VHS tape, color off, over saturated, too grainy, If I did not like the 7.1 DTS and picture quality of the 2D blu ray would have returned it, dont buy it, if your just wanting it for the 3D only"
1,How low can you go?,"No lower than this as far as I can see. This film is a very very sad state of affairs, aimed at those too stupid to realise they are watching a gay love story. So bad."
1,A stunning bore,"Maybe I shouldn't even be posting a review, because I started watching it, then stopped after 45 minutes because I was so bored. I just don't find anything interesting about supposedly grown men acting like 14 year olds, with stupid nicknames and aren't-we-cool-jargon."
5,top gun dvd,"arrived and in good time(not opened yet, though)I would use this co. again. Newbrite is the name of the supplier"
3,Not Worth It,"I really love this movie. I used to watch it when I was a kid. When i bought it on DVD, I expected it to be really great - high quality picture, explosive sound - but it really wasn't all that better than the original. The picture is similar to a VH Scan and the dialog was horrible. For the first half of the movie, none of the dialog matches the actors' lips. It seems like this imperfection could have been ameliorated in the editing room fairly easily. The sound effects and musical score redeem the movie to some extent, but the mismatched dialog is dificult to ignore. Maybee I'm just nitpicking here, but when I buy a DVD over cassette format, I expect a higher quality movie. I didn't get that with this DVD. My suggestion is to buy the cassette version and maybee save a couple of bucks."
3,For viewers who likes MACHOS!!!,"Tom Cruise plays maverick, the cooliest guy in the world and at the end of the movie, he kills all the vilains. Non-realistic movie, but some scenes are enjoyables. Val Kilmer is absolutelly poor!!!"
4,Real slick.....,"This is a movie one can see over and over again...and is up, up and away better on DVD. Absolutely stunning aerial photography, great lines, good acting all around, real exciting scenes, though aerial combat sequences are not as realistic as one expects it to be, but then, it is a movie. The objective is to entertain and to help pump up the adrenaline while just sitting down...and in this the movie succeeds, helped on by some good themely athmospheric soundtrack."
3,On dvd at last for a good old waltz down 80's Boulevard,"Nice to see it on DVD, but surley no one needs a review of this film? Just a thought though...... you all remember the bit when Maverick races off on his bike UP the hill towards the beach to reclaim his love interest? Well, if he was tearing up that hill the next bit of beach he would come to would be in Florida. As I said just a thought."
3,Navy Pilot,"This product was describedand delivered here in timely fashion,dramawith actionthis makes for a seriously good movie."
5,"""I feel the need, the need for speed!""","Top Gun is the story of elite U.S. Navy Fighter Pilots and their quest to be the most distinguished graduates from the Top Gun special training school. I first saw this movie when I was eight years old, and a career as a Fighter Pilot became an instant desire. This film is filled with edge of the set exhilaration, and contains some of the best camera work of supersonic jet action for a motion picture. There are several valuable undertones to this movie which includes camaraderie, competitiveness, and professional pride towards military duty. Top Gun is an action packed film that will forever remain exciting.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
3,"Great Movie, Terrible DVD!","While this movie is one of my all time favorites and a must for everybody's DVD library, there are NO special features! No 'Making of the movie', no 'deleted scenes', no commentary. How can such a great movie be put on a DVD without any special features? I'm hoping there will be a re-release of the DVD that will be much better!"
5,TOP GUN BABY!!!!,Classic comedy. Val Kilmer and Tom Cruise are so hilarious in this movie. Every cinema-phile should own this movie as part of his collection.
1,Horrible transfer to 3D,"As others have already pointed out, the transfer to 3D is horrible. I was convinced at first I must have received a defective copy but after reading the other reviews clearly that is not the case. One of my favorite action movies ever...ruined to the point of who cares about the 3D, the graininess is so bad in many scenes that it is un-watchable IMO. Much better off just watching the 2D blu-ray disk, which I already owned so now I have two. Sigh, lesson learned - never pre-order a new release.Also note that almost every review SINCE THE 3D BLU-RAY RELEASE has been 1 or 2 stars. The high ratings for this disc were written BEFORE it was even released (I hate it when people do that). If you look at the actual post-release ratings, it gets about a 1-1/2 star rating, which should tell you something.Shame on Paramount Studios for releasing a garbage 3D transfer of a great movie."
3,"Script/dialouge-2 stars, acting-3 stars, Cinemaph- 4 stars","The best of the best? Well, not the script. THe acting isn't that bad. Tom Cruise and Anthony Edwards could never be bested by any other duo for Mav and Goose. Same for Val and Rick Rossovich as Iceman and Slider. Great chemistry for the two teams as they verbally abuse each other while trying to vie for the honours at Top Gun. Special FX for flights and airfights are great. Kelly Mcgillis is somewhat misplaced as the roamantic interest for Tom Cruise. The rest of the cast is well placed, and so are the other bits.Highlight: Iceman / Slider engaged against 5 (or was it 6?) Mig 28's and barely keeping away from becoming cannon fodder. Really tense.Lowpoint: Mav trying to lure Charlie (McGillis) into lustly ventures. Bad lines."
1,Top Gun Widescreen special collectors edition,It's not widescreen. I hate watching movies and tv shows when it is cutoff at the top and bottom. Too me its a bait and switch I should have read the reviews from other buyers.
2,full of themselves,wow this is one of the most homoerotic films ever......The boys play volleyball all in their short shorts with the dog tags flying high....macho macho.....mav goose...iceman come on gay gay gay
2,TOP GUN: THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Having been a Naval Corpsman with the vile task of assisting Flight Surgeons in thier evaluation of the physical and mental attributes of pilots and pilot-wanna-bes, I can only assume this ""film"" to be a recruitment video...nothing more, nothing less. While I concur with SEAL/TEAM below that the video montages are thrilling, viewers should keep in mind that Navy pilots are by definition pricks who do not sing in bars, walk into womens bathrooms, buzz towers, or care about...things. They are barely distiguishable from psychopaths. One should dread thier very presence, and forgoe the worship stuff in favor of Satan. THIS IS NO SUCH THING AS A LUKE SKYWALKER. A DARTH VADER MAYBE."
1,Blu Ray Review,"I know alot of people are upgrading their dvd collection to blu ray. However, that being said, most people only upgrade if the upgrade is worthy. Well this is one of those that are NOT worthy. My DVD version upgraded to HD looks the same. Come on Paramount, get in gear and give us a totally new remastered version for Blu Ray.The picture looks the same as it did when I used to watch this on a 19"" inch TV in the late 80's on a rented VHS tape. Paramount should be ashamed, this is not even close to 720 let alone 1080. I have old DVD's that offer a better picture in the bluray player then this. Yes it does have a cool menu but the picture is NOT high-Def and the sound is only acceptable when you put the setting on 6.1 DTS Master (only reason I gave 1-star). If you do not have a good external speaker system do not waste your money because the picture and the sound won't be worth it."
4,Top BluRay Gun,"Some years ago, I was sitting in an A/V store. To demonstrate Surround Sound as a NEW audio enhancement, the salesman slipped Top Gun into the DVD player. The sound reproduction as the fighters took off and landed on the air craft carrier deck BLEW US AWAY.So, I purchased the BluRay version of Top Gun which I played on my Sony BDP-S350 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player, Sony HT-SS2300 Component Home Theater System and Sony Bravia XBR-Series KDL-37XBR6 37-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV. WOOOOOOOOOOOW! It's better than I thought was ever possible!"
3,MST3K Fans Rejoice -- Rifftrax is Here!,"Iceman, Maverick and Slider: while they make great names for members of a tracksuit wearing boy band, they make even better names for shirtless, pretty boy pilots! And Tom Cruise is the prettiest and shirtless-liest of them all as Maverick, a bad boy aviator who lock horns with the large-toothed Iceman (Val ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" Kilmer) and locks other things with the saucy MIT-educated Naval consultant Charlie (Kelly ""Supergator"" McGillis). And if you're a fan of music that is likely to be heard in an aerobics class, you'll love the pulse-pounding soundtrack by disco top gun Giorgio Moroder! For this RiffTrax, Mike flies high with his Mystery Science wingman, Bill Corbett. It will literally ""take your breath away""!**No breath will actually be taken away. When we say ""literally"" we don't literally mean it."
3,"Not bad, not great","It is rather ridiculous but it works well enough as entertainment. The movie doesn't add up to much, but it works okay as no-brainer entertainment (unlike Armageddon, which was just plain terrible.)"
4,"An oldie, but...","I originally saw this in the theater, and when this movie first came out on VHS, I saw it on a neighbor's in-home theater system, and the sensation was beyond words (for the time).Fast forward to DVD and today's theater technology, and this is still a great movie. But the addition of the second disk really makes this a great deal. The background of the film and the commentary from those Naval aviators who did the flying made this something I could not pass up.I was lucky enough to get a ride in an F-4 and land on the USS Eisenhower in the '70s, and the term ""postage stamp in the middle of the ocean"" doesn't begin to describe what you see.This is a great deal, and I recommend it to all.."
5,The Best of the BEST!,"Take a ride on the wild side! I can still remember the day I got my first car. The only tape I had was the TOP GUN soundtrack! Put thing that thing in and drive like Maverick. The first CD I've ever bought was the TOP GUN sountrack, and now following tradition the first DVD I bought was TOP GUN too! If you guys ever come to Toronto, we have TOP GUN the ride at the Paramount Park.. AWESOME!"
5,Top Gunnin,Greatfuly i didn't have to wait for weeks before delevery of the dvd. It came in great condition in original packaging. Proble one of the fastest delevery times i have seen from any seller on Amazon.
2,the jets have more personality than the characters,"Ok, I like this movie and watch it often (at least, I watch the flying scenes a lot, a nice benefit of DVD) but the script is weak and the characters laughable. Tom Cruise would have been busted out of the Navy in the first 10 minutes, and the dialogue is painful. But the cinematography is terrific, and they have lots of real shots of carrier operations and F-14s (even if the film-makers have little comprehension of modern air combat). Watch it straight through only if you're nostalgic for the 80's. Great supporting cast with little to do. Watch for Tim Robbins as Merlin -- you only see him without his oxygen mask on the carrier deck near the end!"
2,"Good cover, bad, very bad insides","Don't judge a book by its cover, .... This is just plain awful. Blood & guts with no story. The writing is amatueristic dribble, like all thos 80's horror cheese books. Buy it only if you like gratuitous splatter with nothing more. ... I couldn't even finish it. It's in the recycle bin in the garage right now. Two stars, because of a cool cover."
4,A movie for rat lovers,"This movie is not about rats randomly attacking people because of some crazed science experiment. Instead, this movie is best described as a psychological thriller where Willard battles against his inner demons and his mean boss at his job.It is a very well developed story, in a psycho kind of way. A grown man living with his elderly sick mother. Trying to cope with his confinement and his loneliness. Because of circumstances beyond his control, he himself becomes like a mouse, trapped in a steel cage.At the end of the movie (VHS version) there is a strange, but entertaining music video staring Willard and his rats. I recommend that you buy this movie."
3,Not Worth it,I saw this movie and it is not scary its about a psyhco who likesrats. its weird but in the best possible way. If you really wantto see it run to blockbuster and get the original its alot better.
1,How Could You Like This Piece of Crap,"Man, this is a pile of [...], only rivaled by Halloween 3. If you own both of these movies then you should either throw them away now or kill yourself. The guy who played Willard did alright for such a bad part and the girl he liked looked good, but that's a given. It's against the law not to have the best looking people in movies. I really don't see how this has averaged 4 stars when everyone I know that's seen it hated it. Really, this is pure [...], piled ontop of more [...], then shoved in the toilet that's already clogged by [...]."
3,It's Ok!,This is not a toy that my daughter really responds well to. When I first bought it (2mos) she couldn't even really hold on to it. It was too thick. Now at 6 mos she can hold on to the ring but it isn't one of the toys that holds her attention very long.
3,"Great product, but slight disappointment.","While this is a great product for any Gundam fan, I was slightly dissappointed. The first time I had watched Gundam Seed, I watched it on an anime site. For three days I watched nothing but Seed and Seed: Destiny, liking it so well I deicided to try and order the series. How ever when I ordered this collection. I was dissapointed to find that, instead of it being broken up into episodes, it was broken up into three diffrent movies. Which really isnt a bad thing save for the fact that a lot of scenes has been cut from them. Many scenes which are needed to get a clear idea of whats going on. How ever if you are new to Seed, then this is the perfect thing for you."
5,Microfinance at its finest,Microfinance is one of the newest strategies for development and Princeton economist Morduch takes a look at how it impacts societies. While he only looks briefly at the social issues he makes several compelling economic arguments for why we should consider microfinance as a viable option. The book is very well written although I think it does leave out some of the long term structural and institutional changes that need to be addressed. This is a field where new research comes out every day but Morduch's book is likely to be a staple for a very long time. This is a must have for anyone studying microfinance and will be for a long time to come.
4,Ah! Tanith Lee short stories!,"A couple stories didn't move me. But the rest DID. The short stories range from quirky to chilling to poignantly beautiful, with scenes set in our world & others.Even my little brother got all dewy-eyed & reverent when I made him read one of the stories. That says a lot."
4,Great for car,"My son loves trains and really enjoys playing with this when he is sitting in his car seat. The magnetic pieces just stick to the board to store it and you can slide it in the backseat pocket of your car. It is a bit tall (it's more like the legal size instead of letter size,) to take on a plane but keeps him very busy in the car."
1,"Book should be called ""What Makes Mr. Groome A Catholic""","This book should not be considered an authoritative guide into ""what makes us Catholic"". Rather, this seemed to be one man's personal, watered- down Catholic opinions. He does not echo or boldly state the Church's teachings, which is invaluable toward the end his book's title suggests. I wanted a book that would help me delve deeper into the beauty of being Catholic. I was sorely disappointed."
4,What DOES Make Us Catholic???,"I just finished Thomas Groome's ""What Makes Us Catholic"" and found it to be worthwhile reading. Groome describes a good priest as one who 'companions people like a soul friend and serves the community's spiritual hunger through Word and Sacrament... enabling the gifts of all to work well together--with ""holy order"".'Primarily, though, the book is about each person's call to holiness, regardless of station in life, and how our Catholic faith assists us in that life long journey.I've added to my ""to do"" list Groome's suggestion of writing a personal foundation prayer or morning offering as described on p. 202.A soundbite for this book would be ""choose for life for all""."
1,Sceptical,"I think it is good to read about religion but I'm not so sure about this book's author's intentions. Da n patrick has always been prety arragant and now we hear him shamelessly self promote his book day after day after day after day on his radio. It just seems like he is out to make money, not converts."
1,WWE product therefor fabricated.,"WCW was the greatest wrestling ever. This package does not show the WCW beatings of WWF at all and is way to self absorbed in the WWE side. The fact that Vicne has WCW rights is BS.....Ted Turner killed WCW not Bishoff, Bishoff came up with the greatest wrestling story angle in history that has still never been bested. This is a WWE product so this wont reflect WCW very much or their accomplishments. HAIL WCW 95-98 the greatest wrestling ever filmed."
4,"So far, so good.","I've used the 15lb braid (4lb mono equivalent) three times now, and thus far, it's done well. VERY smooth (and silent) coming off the reel. No noticeable stretching in the line so far. My only concern is that, the first time I used it, I got a nick in the line when I hung up between some rocks. I'm continuing to use it with the nick in it, just to see how it holds up. I don't know if the hang-up I had was severe enough to cause a nick in braid this thick (I didn't think it was), but I'm still using it, catching mostly bluegills, and it hasn't caused me any problems yet. Thus far, I can easily recommend it."
1,Very poor installation instructions,I have a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and a Masters in Computer Science and still had significant challenges in getting the software configured. Not for the faint of heart! Seriously recommend looking at Panasonic cameras before purchasing one of these. You have been warned!
1,BEWARE!!!,They can't support this properly - beware. A simple question on how to connect this wirelessly they can't provide help. They then actually had the nerve to tell me to seek support from the retailer!!Beware.
1,Don't Bother with Wireless,"Using a wired connection, I got all of the features working. However, the color quality was very poor, with a magenta cast. The pan/tilt motors whirred loudly - so much for unobtrusiveness.The real troubles started when I went wireless. If I just viewed the video stream, it worked, but as soon as I tried to pan/tilt/zoom, the camera would lock up. It required a power-cycle to regain response.I returned it."
2,Underwhelmed,"I did a fair amount of research before buying this camera, reading reviews, comparing specs, etc. I was fairly confident this was the best internet camera in my price range. I don't know whether or not that's true or if this camera is representative of security cams in general, but I do know I was not impressed by this camera on any level.Video quality is terrible. Awful in low light. Setup and configuration procedures are draconian. The motor is LOUD when you pan or tilt.It's entirely possible I'm being unfair. There are challenges for compressing and delivering video over wireless or ethernet. Sacrifices in image quality must be made to limit bandwidth. The only other 'security' cameras I've had experience with are the 20 dollar x10 types which gave me exactly what I expected for 20 dollars.I didn't expect to get the same image quality from a three hundred dollar camera."
5,Perfect,"This CD finds the composer, conductor and both artists in inspirational forms. This awesome song cycle enables both singers to demonstrate their art. If you are not acquainted yet with Fischer Dieskau's lied performances you can start here as in this period he was at his very peak. Fischer Dieskau is the most important lied singer of all times and he is well matched by Elizabeth Schwartskopf, another lied expert. Szell is also at his very best and this performance easily surpasses all competitors."
5,THE STANDARD IN TEJANO MUSIC,"THIS CD SETS THE STANDARD IN TEJANO MUSIC.. EVERY TRACK IS A HIT... DAVID LEE COULDN'T FIND A BETTER PERSON THAN ""THE VOICE"" JAY PEREZ TO BE LEAD SINGER ON THIS CD.."
1,Get the imported version with SACD,"This CD was listed as a CD/SACD + DVD on the depechemode.com website. The CD layer on the SACD was also DSD remastered and was an improvement over the regular CD release.I think they should be presenting a CD/SACD + DVD (as originally designed) on this 'remaster' series, not just a plain CD with an additional DVD. Get the imported version with SACD."
5,still the best,"I have to say that this is still my favorite DM CD. It is one of the shortest and it has prominent guitars, but it also has some of the best song writing that the band has ever done. Every piece of music on this CD is perfection (the sweetest perfection).I highly recommend this CD for people who think they wouldn't like DM. I know a lot of metal/punk people (myself included) who really see how great this CD is once they let go of their DM preconceptions.Everyone should have this music!"
3,Come on this is no sweetest perfection! - 3.3 stars,"This is a good album but the reviews here i think are from mostly die-hard fans who can get a little carried away. I like depeche mode don't get me wrong but the casual lyrics lack a passion and the accompanying slow systematic techno-pop arrangements just don't inspire me. Best songs i think are ""Halo"", ""Clean"" and ""Policy of truth"". Still I rate none of these songs over 7/10 and i have listened to the album 5-6 times. If you're new to DM buy anyone of the Singles collections or 101. I just bought this because i was curious, but really it isn't a must if you're a casual DM fan like myself."
3,Definitely NOT their best album,"I'll buck the trend here. I am a big fan of DM, but this album (with the exception of Halo) leaves me disappointed whenever I listen to it. There's only about 3 songs I won't skip through. At best, it's average. Maybe it's because it was played to death. Doesn't come near Music for the Masses or Black Celebration. I'd say this album marks the start of DM's slide. Plus Violator has one of DM's most annoying songs - Personal Jesus. It's almost as annoying as Master and Servant."
3,hmm!,"To my suprise. I did not know wey too manny people actualy love this cd. Wich makes senss that a few people made fun of me for doing a piss poor review on it. I hardly ever lissen to it. I am much more into the industrial stuff like ""Gravity Kills""!"
5,Their Best,"Simply put, DMode hit gold in 1990. This album is so gorgeously crafted, from beginning to end. Crafted with perfect precision, Violator switches things up to avoid repetition of songs, opened by an ever-growing somber ""World Through My Eyes"", followed by the Gore lead ""Sweatiest Perfection"". Of course, the song after, Personal Jesus, REALLY switches it up; it's guitar lead! With a beautiful ballad in ""Waiting for the Night"" and equal beauty in the restlessness pulse of the smash hit ""Enjoy the Silence"", the album only flattens a bit with the Gore-lead ""Blue Dress"". But it's followed by more innovative genius, closing with ""Clean"". Complete with live drums, it sets the the stage for the album that would follow, Songs of Faith and Devotion. Brilliant.For the best DMode ever had to offer in one studio album, Violator packs a punch."
5,Unparalleled sound design and arrangements,I can't say how many times I listened to this since it came out. My first exposure to the album was back when Enjoy the Silence came out... I absolutely loved the king-in-the-mountains video. It was actually one of my first cd's. I recommend this album to anyone interested in listening to poppy electronic music. The sound design and arrangements are absolutely unparalleled among synthpop albums. A studio masterpiece.
3,Lost Treasure,"Long before Jennifer Lopez and Hilary Duff attempted (and succeeded, at least commercially) to make transitions from acting to singing, ""A Different World"" star Jasmine Guy released her self-titled debut. Some may remember the ballad ""Just Want to Hold You"" (featuring James Ingram), but most people don't remember Jasmine's short-lived stint as a recording artist. The songs are of the R&B/pop/dance variety, most comparable to Pebbles, Paula Abdul, Taylor Dayne, Jody Watley, etc. It's a shame that other than on-stage appearances in ""Chicago"" Jasmine's voice has not been heard."
5,a cool collection,a couple of masterpieces here by a master filmmaker - peckinpah changed the way the western was made. and the way it was seen by audiences.
3,okay movie....featurette is missing from DVD..,Hi folks...this is sure a non-typical Peckinpah movie and sort of fun in its own way and heck....Stella Stevens makes it worth paying close attention to...My biggest dissapointment is the outside cover says a VINTAGE FEATURETTE: Sam Peckinpah's West: A study of the Filmaker is included..and its NOT..only a very LAME and horribly filmed recent and rambling discourse by Stella Stevens who should SUE the students who filmed her for the horrible way she is photographed....a really amateurish production that WB should be ashamed of...Peckinpah would kick somebodys BUTT if he were alive to see it..enjoy the movie...its fun
3,Wild Bunch & Pat Garrett & Billy The Kid,"While both of these titles play OK on my DVD player, neither will playon my pc properly. They both arer stuck on the voice over commentary track.and I don't know why. It is perplexing. I have three copiesof ""Pat Garrett..."" and all three have the same problem, on both discs,the Directors Cut and the 1988 release version. I would like to know why and how to correct it.HELP!"
5,Lightning In a Bottle,"Sam Peckinpah, departing from his usual offering of slow-motion displays of violence, caught lightning in a bottle with this little-known gem of a movie. It shouldn't work; really, it shouldn't. The cast of characters includes a prostitute with a heart of gold, a fraudulent preacher, two stagecoach drivers, and a prospector who is severely down on his luck. Yet out of these cliches, Peckinpah produces a beautiful, lyrical love story. Jason Robards, as always, is superb as the title character, and Stella Stevens gives the performance of her life as Hildy, the prostitute who falls in love with him.Don't miss this one."
5,Interesting Required Reading,"This is not a book I would have picked up if I was just browsing; however, I can honestly say it is a diversified collection of essays and information designed to open our eyes to ""Race, Class, and Gender in the United States."" I like it and have found out many things that are never talked about in history or business law. If you need this book, be prepared to have your thoughts probed and ideas enlightened."
3,Bought this book to see about building my own pole barn,"Bought this book to see about building my own pole barn since I had built my own house. But upon reflection, I had someone else build it."
1,Ask Homer at Home Depot,"I would have returned this book but by the time I paid shipping it wasn't worth it. There is very little in this book of use, almost all of it is outdated, tools and equipment, etc. There are much better books on the market. This one might have been better if it wasn't so old. I have been an architect for 25 years and there just isn't anything in this that is useful. Very disappointing."
3,"Accurate? Don't know, but Bridges is great.","Unlike the other reviewers, I can't vouch for the historical accuracy of this film. What I can say, however, is that I thoroughly enjoyed Bridges' portrayal of the rough and tumble Wild Bill. I lost the sense that I was watching an actor at work behind the moustache, twin pistols and gruff mannerisms that Bridges brings to the character. I found the central conflict of a very tough and manly man coming to terms with his own legacy poignant and interesting. I recommend giving it a look-see, and I plan on buying it when it comes out on DVD."
3,Don't you dare touch my hat,"This movie has it's moments, which unfortunately do not come too often. Eileen Barken isn't too convincing as Calamity Jane. I would rate this movie as, if you want to see it then do so, otherwise watch something else."
4,they filmed the legend and not the facts...and I enjoyed it!,Yup they took tons of legends and myths about Wild Bill and shoe-horned em all into this flick featuring wonderful performances by the entire cast. Bridges performance as Wild Bill doesnt completely white-wash the character and so you may or may not like that. I enjoyed it and as a student of the life and legend of James Butler Hickok I had a good time spotting the myths and legends used to make this film. It sure seems to me that director Hill had to make a lot of cuts to decrease the running time of this film and I bet the director's cut would be much better. Still this is what it is and it's not bad and in fact it's damn fun. Just remember that this isn't a documentary. Fans of the legends and myhts of Wild Bill may enjoy it more than others. I did.
1,No Jimi In Here,"This is a documentary showing other musicians recording a tribute to Jimi Hendrix album at the end of the nineties. You get the feeling most of the musicians aren't really even that familiar with Hendix' music. I did like the Five Blind Boys From Alabama; they were working out a gospel sounding acappela version of Driftin' which sounded like it was going to be great. But none of the tracks are played as a finished product, and there is definitely no Jimi Hendrix appearing in this film. I guess they couldn't find him."
3,"For your information, Michael Mello is deceased -- see University of Vermont website for details.","For your information, Michael Mello is deceased.Please see the University of Vermont website for further details."
3,Condition of product,The case for the CD was cracked and it looked as if it had already been opened. I would think there would be a better way to ship these products.
3,"What song is in the ""flying to rio"" scene?",The best song in the entire movie is when Carrie is flying to Rio...its beautiful...it would make this album amazing.
5,Agatha Christie Fooled Me Again!,"A young man and his sister from London rent a house in a country town so he can recover from his injuries. Shortly after arriving, they receive an anonymous letter accusing them of not really being siblings. They soon find out that people all over town have been receiving such letters. This leads to two deaths.The detectives, this man and his sister do most of the sleuthing. Toward the very end of the book, the vicar's wife calls in Miss Marple who is able to put the final pieces together.Agatha Christie usally ""gets me"" about half the time (as far as guessing, ""who done it,""), and she got me on this one! A pleasant read."
2,Be Careful with BBC.Radio Drama Audio Crime,Some of the Audio BBC are quite good. However Moving Finger was just ok. It lacked the mood of the unabridged original. I was never quite sure of the extent of damage done to Jerry's legs.It failed to capture the atmoshpere of the original. Also the ending differed from the original to a certain extent. Some of these dramas are fairly well done. Moving Finger just was not in that category. Go for the unabridged audio or the novel.
5,great product,I have these on all my scopes they work great but every year or after used i put a small amount of vasaline on the seal parts so they don't crack or break work better after application
1,wrong stuff,you sent the wrong paper by the picture...they were suppose to be 4x6 not the productthat was sent
3,Eclectic,"If you know what you're looking for and willing to turn the pages, you'll find some great history of the SF Opera productions."
2,Great Expectations Fall Short,"Hip-noir set in Manchester (England, not New-Hampshire) doesn't really live up to expectations. The premise of a transexual hit (wo)man coming back home to off a club owner amongst all the club kids and nutters sounds lively and promising. The devil is in the writing though, and although quick-reading, the prose doesn't quite deliver."
5,Roll down the window........,"I admit i was ify about buying it, but when i was in a store, they was playing a song and i was like this is hot and didn't think much of it. Then they played another song and i was like whoa and went and ask who was singing, and the guy said SAMMIE, i said holy Sh!t. Yo, this little boy can sang his ass off. So i bought it on impulse of those 2 songs, but when i got home and listened to it i was like ""good investment"". Yo go and buy this album, don't sleep on him cause he is a kid, he has some very hot tracks. ou already know what to do when you buy it. Do yourself a favor and buy it."
3,Sammie,"Sammie...great voice, great talent, TO YOUNG. He sings great but he is too young. I bet his voice hasent even changed yet"
2,Thia was okay,This CD is not the best I have ever heard. i guess it just depends on your style of music.
3,disjointed,"Nick Nolte is Jack Cates, a worn-out cop who gets Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) out of prison for 48 hours to try to catch Reggie's old partner.It's the classic misfit partners action/adventure story with a good dose of humor thrown in (it is Eddie Murphy, after all).And actually, both actors do really well, and are very convincing in the roles. I completely buy Nolte's character as a cop who's seen it all and isn't very happy about it. And Murphy is classic Eddie Murphy--the Eddie Murphy from SNL, not the sanitized Eddie Murphy who makes children's movies. You know, the one whose standup routine broke records for the most frequent use of the word ""f***.""It's just that they seemed to be in two different movies--Nick Nolte in a serious action/adventure, and Eddie Murphy in a comedy. There wasn't any chemistry between them. And that might be just me, because I just read a bunch of reviews on the IMDB that said otherwise. I know I liked it enough back in 1982 to buy the video."
1,Tedious and Dull Like an Unsharpened Pencil.,"Viewed: 7/05Rate: 27/05: 48 Hours is full of crap. The too much profanity in 48 Hours kills my mood. When a sex-starved convict and a hard-nosed cop are looking for two killers that killed many cops, I wonder why Nick Nolte is the only one looking for those guys. What was the point of using a convict? The killers look stupid to me. Why would a guy trade half a million for a girl? With that kind of money, he can get many women as he wants. 48 Hours is just a stupid movie that falls flat on jokes. There isn't much of an action, only a boring chase."
5,I Love This Book!,"I really wish that everyone in the entire world will read this book, because it is everything y'all need to know!"
4,Usual WWE Spin and 1 Question,"One question: why is Jim Ross providing some commentary as if he was with the WWF at the time of the Ultimate Warrior? Ross was with the NWA at the time.Other than that, what the DVD says about the Ultimate Warrior may be true. However, notice everyone on it giving commentary is still in good graces with the WWE. Just something to think about. I'm not trying to imply the DVD is full of lies - just spin."
4,fair depiction of the warrior,"I'll say that I was a huge Warrior fan back in the early 90's, but after watching this I found out that he is a crazy sob. The reason that people found this so one sided and didn't get the Warriors own words was that the WWE went to him to get his side, but hes so insane there was gonna be no way that he would do it. I've read a article by the Ultimate Warrior( and yes that is his legal name now) that he would never bow down and help make money for Vince. He also said that he was going to make a dvd of his own to tell his side. I have been looking for it but haven't been able to find it even on his own website. Until we can hear from him, we must go with this side of the story( even though its basically a bury job)"
3,Good for the memories!!,This dvd is pretty good. By far not the best wwe dvd out but it is good. I think the comments and interviews were as fair as can be without the warrior giving his side of things. You have to remember warrior made a CHOICE not to participate in any of this. you will learn some things you might have not known and christian does a good impression of the warrior. I gave it 3 stars becuase the lack of matches. only a few matches and there all the matches we have seen before. Also for the fact that again warrior decided to not want anything to do with the dvd. unlike lets say bret hart who decided to bury the hacthet and help out in his upcoming dvd set. this dvd is good and i recomend this to anyone that grew up in the era.
2,Not awful but be careful!,"Interested in the Tamil language I bought this CD even though there were no reviews, but it is disappointing. Shalini must be about ten, and her music is like young Debbie Gibson, even dabbling in rap with an older male singer. It's too bad the rich cultural/musical tradition of India's Tamil ethnicity has so little representation."
3,Not his best,"I love Sam Kinison but this CD is really disappointing. His ""Phone Call From Hell"" is the only brilliant bit on the album, and he pads it out with songs that he plays straight. Any other Kinison CD is a 5 star CD, get one of those!"
5,Gombrich's Story of Art,"After both my daughters had read Gombrich's A Little History of the World, I bought The Story of Art for my 14 year old daughter, who is now half way through it only two weeks later. The Little History is written for the younger reader but it provides an informative and entertaining overview for adult readers as well. The art book is actually a college-level text, but because Gombrich is a natural educator who relates directly to his reader, the overview is both fascinating and easy to follow."
5,A Steal,An excellent book in an easy to read formatt. My professor used it for my art history class. Beautirul illistrations. Highly recommended. Great reference book as well.
3,Didnt work to bake with,"I tried to make cinnamon rolls with it, but it didnt seem to rise , maybe I used the wrong amount anybody knows?"
1,"Boring, Bland and Repetitive","This game is boring, visuals are bland and it's very repetitive. this game is 2 stars as best. avoid at all costs."
1,cd,This must have been really early stuff. She's a wonderful singer and this CD doesn't do her justice.
1,Complete Garbage!,"This book was complete and utter rubish, I have never read ANYTHING that so insults women. I mean, I know this book is from either the 60s or 70s but that is still no excuse for the complete disregard for females. In this book ""J"" claims that women should think and fantasize about their men all day, but not be disapointed when they don't treat them in the same way. This is a horrible book, and I am appaled to know that it is still in print."
3,This story fails to tell the story of the real mountain man.,"It is clear that this is a tall tale as Mike runs away from home at age two days. The illustrations are very well done. BUT Mike Fink was a real person, and I would prefer a real story about the real character instead of this yarn. Kellogg could have made up a character and told the same story. It has nothing to do with the real Mike Fink."
4,Thoughtful and brilliant.,"Few songwriters have the scope to submerge themselves in music that -in a certain way- is foreign and explore it with such deepness as Paul Simon. Like Peter Gabriel, Simon has succesfully and humbly listened carefully before contributing in a note of his own. The result is compelling: he neither fades out the great rythm or melodies of Olodum or the great Milton Nascimento in a stab of egotism, nor loses his usual brightness and melodic creativity in the process. One of my favorite records, doubtlessly."
2,The well has run dry,"After the incredible success of GRACELAND, Simon returns to his investigation of cross cultural pop with this look at the music of Brazil. The problem is it is far less satisfying in its execution. The music does not have the bite that was found on GRACELAND it tends to meander and lacks the strength of rhythm found on GRACELAND. Lyrically there are no real standouts; one song seems to drift into another without leaving anything more than a faint trace on your memory. It really works wells as new age background music, but that's really not what I want when I get a Paul Simon recording."
5,Excellent,"This is my favorite of Paul Simon's studio albums. I know the critics prefer others, and most people I know say ""Rhythm of the ... what? ...I only like Simon and Garfunkel ..."" But in my opinion the songs, musicians, production ... everything about this album is perfect. And ""Cool River"" is by far the coolest 9/8 I've ever heard."
5,Capturing the Friedmans,"This harrowing film blends the Friedman's early light-hearted home movies with footage of the unfolding scandal, juxtaposing a seemingly idyllic family life with a domestic situation rife with anger, resentment and pain. Viewers may differ on Arnold and Jesse's degree of guilt, but few will maintain there wasn't something weird going on in that house. A bold, unsparing piece of work."
5,Great Service!!!,I purchased Tom and Jerry-Shiver Me Whiskers for my daughter and she absolutely loved it. It arrived earlier than I thought I was going to get it. Thank you so much.
1,100% NO GOOD!,"The purpose of this product is to send small bubbles into the water in a fish tank, you connect an airhose to one end and bubbles should come out the entire length of the product, bubbles came out of the first few inches nearest the air tubing only. Clearly the product was never made correctly."
3,It is Cool,"I posted 2 photos of how the 10"" long one looks inside of a 10 Gal tank. Way too big. I didn't really think about how large it would be. It doesn't really bubble the whole thing for me, just the top part. It won't stay flat, it keeps flipping backwards like you see in the photos. I don't have any fish at the moment, but I plan on getting a small bubbler. Maybe a cool ornament one. Probably would look great in a much larger tank."
3,not that bad...,"sure it was exactly like the reviews said it was. it only bubbled out of about half of the stone, which i was worried about before buying it... then i hit it a bunch of times on the side that was not bubbling with a pointy object hoping that would create some cracks to let some bubbles through,. so i hooked it back up and sure enough about 1 minute later i had some bubbles coming out of the other end, not as much as the first few inches but it will due... tank still looks great"
2,"Unequal bubble distribution, much larger bubbles than expected","Mine seems to have the air coming out of a two rows of pinholes long the stone and mostly around the edges, as if there are gaps in the stone-plastic base mount. Do not recommend, unless you want moderate quantities of larger bubbles. Smaller bubbles are better in terms of surface area to speed gas exchange. The gaps on the edges might be just a fluke, but the similarly sized pin hole like air bubbles along the stone seem to be the same size, so I suspect its a design issue, not a one-off bad one. I didn't have this issue with the hydrofarm style ones I got on amazon."
2,Not thorough with air bubbles,The air streams mostly out of one end and doesn't make it all the way to the other end. Manufacturing defect it looks like. I was disappointed when i opened the package and saw the defect right away.
3,Sistema de aireacion,"Las burbujas no logran difuminarse a lo largo de toda la pedra aireadora, no obstante le proporciona al acuario un aspecto interesante y relajante"
4,<ROCKET>,"I saw Erasure on the Wild! tour and it was one of the best concerts ever with a great stage show! This is one of thier top 5 CD's too. Vince and Andy throw down some wicked dance grooves and some memorable slower tracks as well. The surreal dreamy lyrics are ever present of course.My favorites are: ""Blue Savannah""/ ""Drama!""/ ""La Gloria""/ ""You Surround Me""/ ""Brother and Sister""/ and the brilliant ""Piano Song.""This is smooooth!"
4,Allyour favories and an annoying extra,"This is my number one pick for SNL holiday skits. The Church Lady's Rockin' Drum Solo, Sveddy Balls, D*ck in a Box, and the Santa Liners, because you never know who has been sitting on Santa's lap before you. I'd give it fives tars but Kristen Wiig's annoying title character pops up just a little too often for my tastes. Put this video in on Christmas Eve along with Scrooged, and you will have a very merry Christmas.Get this disc instead of ""SNL Christmas"" as it has many more skits, and is just a few pennies more."
2,"Middle Atlantic Name, without the Quality.","I purchases these rails based on the good name of Middle Atlantic, however despite their quality brand I found the rails to be quite lack luster. They appear to have painted the rails black, which is fine, but the paint has found its way into the threads making these rails very difficult to use."
1,Almost as bad as Big Rigs Racing.,"I purchased this piece of junk that is claimed to be a game thinking that I was lucky to find a PlayStation one game in 2005. I soon realized why the plastic wrapping was still intact since the game arrived at the preowned games dealer. Obviously, the previous owner heard how bad RC Helicopter was before even opening it. The story is extremely anticlimactict! As the game would say, ""I be have more fun to vacuum of glass than for to play RC Helicopter."" The translator knew as much English as I know Plutonian."
4,I was delighted with this cream. It claims ...,"I was delighted with this cream. It claims to be nongreasy, takes off dead skin, and smoothes the skin. It lives up to those claims and, in addition, has a very refreshing scent. I would recommend it highly. Oh, the tube also stores with the cap down, so the cream comes out easily"
1,It's hardly even a mask,"Overlong and showcasing the most banal production I've ever heard, ""Behind the Mask"" is an album without flavour or purpose. It isn't because Lindsay Buckingham left, either--they're just plain uninspired. Nicks' ""Freedom,"" co-written with Heartbreaker Mike Campbell, is passable, but the other eleven tracks make a pit of gravel look galvanized. On ""Hard Feelings,"" Buckingham replacement is even insensate enough to sing: ""Still you want to be friends/But I don't want to be just friends."" The most interesting part of the record is the spellbinding cover image, commissioned by Fleetwood to depict the band's spiritual essence, which shows a girl clearly representing Nicks leaving the band behind her--which Nicks actually did three years later."
2,Nothing Behind The Mask,"After Tango In The Night, Lindsey Buckingham, to the surprise of no one, left the band. The remaining members took three years, but released another album, Behind The Mask. They replaced Mr. Buckingham with not one, but two guitarists, Billy Burnette & Rick Vito. While they are competent musicians, the two of them together do not even come close to equaling Lindsey Buckingham. Behind The Mask is not without good tracks, but without Mr. Buckingham around, the Stevie Nicks & Christine McVie songs may as well been solo recordings. It is in fact Stevie Nicks' songs that save this album from totally ruin. ""Love Is Dangerous"" and ""Affairs Of The Heart"" are strong songs as is ""Freedom"". ""Save Me"" is a decent track, but there isn't much else to this album."
2,Just another sequel,The movie is a very dissapointing sequel to the 2001 smash hit that creeped its way on the big screen and scared audiences all over the world. The sequel is nothing like the original. The movie doesn't go into depth and explain the origins of the monster. The plot is rather simple and just has a group of high school football players trapped on their bus with the creeper lurking in the sky hoovering over its prey. The acting in the film is not all that great. The film starts off good but out stays its welcome very quickly as it loses all suspense after the first 35 minutes. The film actually relizes on action to make the film good instead of the horror. The movie deliveres the gore but gore is not the only thing you need to make a film like Jeepers Creepers 2 good.
3,Better than the first!,"I feel this movie is enjoyable. It has good suspense and a good creepy feeling. Not jump out of your seat scary...But, good effects and decent ending. Only thing is...I don't see why the couldn't chop the creeper up into little bits when he had the chance."
1,"Jeepers Creepers 3, ya think? I hope not","""There are two classes of people now,"" one guy says. ""What the will be eaten and the wont be eaten?"" another guy with glasses replies. Just an example of what you're in for in the movie. It's more funny than it is scary, but when it tries to be funny, it's not."
4,Nice sequel.,"This movie is filled with lots of suspense and more footage of 'The Creeper' than the last Jeepers Creepers. It kept me interested all the way through. At the end, it left me wanting a third. This is definately worth a watch. If you don't buy movies, at least rent it. It wasn't scary to me, but very entertaining."
1,Save your money,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. The movie is a pure kill fest. There is no story, no suspense, nothing. The first movie had a lot of suspense and it built up nicely. Granted, that one was a bit campy at the end, but this one can't even find the campground. I love horror movies, even the bad ones...this one doesn't qualify. If you want a crazy suspenseful kill fest get Final Destination 2. FD2 at least keeps you on the edge of your seat, and uses some of the best shock horror sequences. Please SAVE YOUR MONEY. I was duped by some of the reviews I read. I bought it and now I am sorry I did."
1,DONT BE FOOLED INTO BUYING THIS CRAP!!!,This was a very horrible and boring movie which made no sense whatsoever.The movie is not even a continuation of the last one.Most of the movie is spent in a bus with a bunch of annoying teens and theres alot of things which make no sense.Probably the worst horror flick of 2003.
1,Posessed by demons,"I ordered this clock less than three months ago, and within the last several weeks, it has become possessed. The alarm fails to go off occasionally for no explicable reason, and the CD player runs amok, requiring that I unplug the radio from the wall socket. Not only will the demonic thing not play my CD's, it refuses to respond to any of the control buttons once the CD player takes over.It was disappointing to discover that the display has no brightness control, but that information is not always given online. My old GE clock radio, god rest its soul, did have brightness control. I bought this GE based on my high level of satisfaction from my older model that functioned as expected for 16 years before I gave it away.I've already ordered a replacement for this little monster."
1,What A Let Down,"This Hostel is just plain bad. Does not have to Eli Roth touch, and Mr. Kelly said it very clearly without elaborating. He really got to the point. This movie is simply a waste of time without any good qualities. Not suspenseful and a mish mash of a story does not add up. Finally the end to the franchise. At least it should be."
1,0 stars,"I have not seen this movie, and I do not intend to see it. Sorry, but people should know that Sony's Direct To DVD movies are all crap. I can't think of one that was worthwhile. Heck, even the ones that are mainstream are pretty much poo on the bottom of my show. Sony sucks and the Hostel series is nothing without Eli Roth or even Quentin Tarantino, sorry, but Hostel has gone from Graphic Torture Porn to the likes of an episode of The Walking Dead, lame and watered down."
2,Hostel Closes: Spoiler Alert,"For all you big fans ofHostel (Unrated Widescreen Edition)andHostel: Part II (Unrated Widescreen Edition), including myself, you shall be very disappointed in this film.The betting on how people are killed is ludicrous and ruins any chance this film may have had.If the face peeling killing isn't enough for you to turn it off then sit and see how this franchise is put to death.I bet you'll be glad it's now dead."
3,Hostel lll,"The movie it self was just okay, because I guess I was expecting more blood and mayhem from part III."
3,The Weakest In THe Series. But Still Good.,"Pretty weak, the films go in order from 1-3. First being the best, then second a lil less, then 3 the weakest. Still good tho. Nice ideas, just short on violence. I added it to my collection and if your a fan you should too.Plus-+Hostil Style Story+New Place+Naked FemalesCon-Less Gore-Kinda Boring in some parts (felt the need to fast forward but didnt)All in All, watch it. You will enjoy it if your a fan of the series."
1,Horrible,"This movie was just down right horrible, it has nothing to do with the first two movies; I do not know how anyone could rate this a B movie. It is not. The story line sucked, there was no nudity and hardly any gore. It was like a bad teen movie, ya know like the ones you see in every other movie. Dont waste your time with this movie. I would give it no stars if possible!"
3,Torn between 2 or 3 stars...,"Not a bad film but certainly could pass without the ""Hostel"" association as it really just doesn't feel like a continuation of the franchise. A little let down as I was expecting alot more, but overall not a bad film as I've mentioned beforehand. A good, locked in a warm house as it snows outside type of movie, and that's not a bad thing..."
2,Can't even use it.,"It's great other than the fact that the top of it is cut too high. It comes up over my daughter's face covering her mouth and nose. An obvious bad thing. The material is too hot and heavy too. It would be great if we were sleeping outdoors and it was very cold. However, we have heat in our house and it's too hot for our 71 degree house."
3,Mediocre Album from a talented MC,"First off, the cheesy R&B wannabe cover is in no way representative of what Shan was in the past nor of what this album holds. Still, this CD is a far cry from the Juice Crew / BDP feud of old. There appears no hint of the street feel of repping his Queensbridge home against the Boogie Down Bronx. Leaving super producer Marley Marl behind, this album - Shan's third - has more of a club-friendly vibe to it. As he says in one of his songs, ""It ain't a Hip Hop record, it's House."" Shan's quasi-whiny voice and smooth delivery are still present though. Highlights include ""It Ain't a Hip Hop Record"", ""Death was Quite a Surprise"", and ""Time for Us to Defend Ourselves."""
4,Addicted to ritual,Still a classic whirl of early alternative's best- a rousing mix of emotional balladry and thrusting rock aging like special projects do..with grace.
3,"GREAT album, but bad vinyl mix...","I love all of the J.A. albums, but the sound from this ""remastered"" vinyl stinks. Tons of noise and a so-so mix just killed the experience for me, save your money and stick with the CD copy!"
5,"Lots of ""short and sweet""s","Each selection is two to three pages, thus lends itself well to situations where you have less than ten minutes. Found myself reading these to my newborn to get her to go to sleep. Sure beats reading nursery rhymes and fairy tales. Half the time I find my wife listening in. The historical trivia are interesting and written in a humorous way that will keep you coming back for more."
2,not so great,"There is alot of information. It is a good review for anatomy but, the diagrams are very confusing. I read other consumer reviews before I had to purchase for a class and thought "" oh, it cant be that bad."" Well, it is. If you have any say in what books to choose from, try to find something else."
4,Sidney Lumet's legacy,"Making Movies is a concise, conversational and insightful account of a masterful director's own technique. It is mercifully free of gossip, but instead focuses on Lumet's approach to many of his most important films. It's pitched at a general reader who may have little experience of the film industry, but even an experienced director can gain a lot by reading about how he approaches a script creatively, runs his rehearsal room, designs his coverage and deals with his cast and crew. If you're a director yourself it's one to keep handy."
1,dangerous!,tried out this paricon snowboard today with my 8 year old. it is horrible and impossible to stay on more than a few feet. probably due to the fact that it is flimsy and the foot bindings stick out on the bottom somwhat. trying to return. DO NOT BUY!!
3,Hey Not Too Bad!,"this is overall a good product, its cheap meaning its great for beginners or anyone who wants to snowboard. There is only one problem, the foot braces are not set in, they can come off easily and if this happens during your ride down a hill.. well you know."
1,Awful,"If I could give this board less than 1, I would. It's the day after Christmas. My daughter used it once yesterday for 20 minutes. In the first 10 minutes of using it today, it broke. The plastic around the straps cracked. The hassle of trying to figure out how to return it or who to return it to or finding a receipt for a present I bought 3 months ago just doesn't seem worth the hassle. The worst part is the disappointment on her face to have a Christmas present break the day after getting it. I'm so very upset about this poor product."
4,its good,"this is a good start to get you to look at Kav Maga, and start looking for a school near you"
2,Bratz totally stink!,I mean come on! The clothes were out of style years ago and yah parents are going to want to buy their kids a doll thats called &quot;Bratz&quot;! Their line of clothing stinks! Oh yah people really want to walk around wearing shirts and pants that have girls on them with no noses! I give them a 2.
2,Not worth it,"I was dissapointed when i bought this doll, it is twice the price of the other bratz dolls and thiese outfits make the doll look like she is going to a funeral. her shoes are just plain awful and her style is way out of line and she doesnt even come with anything good, she comes with plastic mini makeup that was lost in the toybox the first week. when my 8 year old recieved this toy from santa, i was udderly dissapointed, all of the other bratz dolls were great i wish this one was as good as the others so unless your rolling in money, dont get this doll"
5,Cool Fun,this toy is very popular against us kids but.......... its only if you are really into the doll kinds of toys. I used to be a huge fan of bratz now i just think they are cool but not for my age i still collesct them though becuase maybe one time there won't be any and they will be worth a lot of money to those doll collectors out there. It's very worth your money buy it
5,Bratz Fan,Hi I love bratz and I have almost 30bratz for Christmas I got wintertime wonderland yasmin slumber party jade and chloe and funk'n'glow chloe and formal funk chloePeople on the reviews say that she looks like a witch but she does not she it beautiful. I went to walmart because I had 3 chloe's and I did not know if I wanted her but I went to see the bratz and they had Dana and her id number was 547000 out of 560000 thats a bad id number and guess what they did not have chloe there and my chloe's id number is 200545 out 560000 so I decided to keep her because her things were more pretter that dana's. So if your looking for a great brat buy her because she is so pretty
5,Very helpful,"I am interested in Thomistic metaphysics and having read several books I must say that I found this book extremely helpful. Fr Clarke explains the principles of Thomas' thought in an easy to understand fashion and then convincingly applies them to modern thought. What is especially important in this work is Clarkes development of St Thomas' idea of being as a ""substance in relation"" which be defintion has a communicative value. This theme is stressed often in the book and is useful in having a response to skeptics of knowledge about the material world. Fr Clarke also gives compelling modern versions of Thomas' 5 Ways of arguing for the existence of God. Well done."
4,An Entertaining Game!,"This game was an enjoyable ""night out"" for my husband and I. The game is very subjective and a point system is given to the images you see in the blotches on the page. Your answers are judged by your opponent(s) and a lot of convincing is needed sometimes to let the other person ""see"" what you do. The object is to be the first move a peg down the board and back by the amount of objects named and accepted. Creativity is a must. We feared that the game would only be good as long as there was a new page to play, but we found that rolling the dice for categories (creatures,people,food,wearables) caused one to see ""new"" images on even the pages we had already used. This game would be entertaining at a get-together and with families, but it is highly enjoyable for two also! A great buy for the price!"
2,You get what you pay for,"The old maxim applies very well to this noticeably low end product. My supervisor bought several of these monitors to replace the tired old 17"" CRTs we had around the office and, upon installing them, instantly regretted it. While the dead pixels that plauged most of the screens were irriating enough, the 'pixel jitter' that afflicted every one of the monitors was murder on the eyes. The latter effect was a result of the poor design of the monitors and the low quality electronics used in the monitors' analog to digital converters. There is a reason why Envision can undersell every other manufacturer (...) -- corners were cut in design and manufacture of this product"
5,1700s,"Easy right out of the box with XP home, instantly recognized as a PNP montitor. Driver was recognized well when XP was told to update the driver from the floppy."
5,Flat Out Best For the Price,I bought this flat panel based on user recommendations and reviews and I wasn't disappointed one pixel.It's a beauty and easily [priced]less than anything its equal on the market.Most monitors at this price have far worse resolution and pitch.Mine worked perfectly and with zero configuration right out of the box and I'm ready to buy a couple more to replace my other old CRT monitors.
5,A Recipe for Mending,"Simply stated, one of the best books for healing and growth (and humor) I've ever read...well, to be specific, I've ever read 5 times! It's a simple read, yet keeps your eyes glued to its pages; its voice strikes you right to your core and makes you wonder if it wasn't written solely for you! I've loaned it to friends a million times over, and it's never been received with anything less than pure excitement, relief, pleasure, and appreciation. Great writing, great book, great lessons. It's both practical and spiritual, humorous and poignant, insightful and memorable. It's a book you won't soon forget."
3,"Verne REPENTS... re:pointless upgrade, 6 was better","Ok, so I was wrong. Not the first time. After 3 months using 7 it has grown on me and now I like it. It is still ""just Photoshop"" so what's the big deal? But maybe the following review, written the first week I had the upgrade, was unwarrented. I'm sorry.PREVIOUS REVIEW: I make my living with Photoshop and this 7.0 upgrade is a joke. On some machines I went back to 6.0 by uninstalling 7. This has become like 1950's car styling--only difference year to year was different fins...Adobe did this for one reason; to bring in cash--not to make a work horse product any better."
5,more than just an upgrade,"This is more than just an upgrade. P7 is a serious improvement and will help spur marketkplace acceptance of digital cameras, because now you will be able to do edits faster.Adobe continues to release products to market that solve real problems, faster. The integration with the other products is also nice. P7 is by far the most useful. You can do so many things with it; you won't reget getting this product."
3,Cheap construction,"It hasn't broke yet but I'm sure it will. The axle flexes badly just rolling on concrete, one good lump in the grass should finish it off. Good idea, lousy design."
2,Not too sturdy,"Serves the purpose, but tends to slip. Our frame is heavy in relation to the wheels, so it still isn't smooth sailing to move the frame around, but it definitely beats not having any wheels. Seems there ought to be a way to connect them more securely to the frame."
3,works but wobbly,Was kind of disappointed by how cheap and wobbly these were. So far OK but seems like they could break with just a bit of pressure when turning. They do perform the intended operation of allowing one person to move the hammock stand around. Just thought they would be a little bit more sturdy for the price that was paid.
2,Rope Hammock,"We purchased hammock in March after 4 months the rope on the ends and which connects to the steel frame, shredded, unwound, whatever, we have to return the item and that is not easy since it is a defect and there is no form for returning after such a late date.Looks great."
3,NO STAND,Hammock is fine just be aware that it does not include a stand. For some reason the pictures and the vague description led me to believe it did.
2,Not a double like the double I bought 5 years ago.,"I've been buying (for me and for gifts) pawley's island hammocks for over 30 years. This current double (or large) pawley's island rope hammock is not really a double. It's closer to the size of a single. I bought a double pawley's island rope hammock about 5 years ago and the older one is much wider and longer. I guess that is why they now have the larger hammocks(i.e., presidential)...they are probably the size of the old double. I can live with this for a few years, since the cottom hammocks only last about that long. The poly or duracord last longer, but truthfully, they feel hard when laying on them. The cotton is really much more comfortable. Although the size has reduced, I don't think the quality has. We shall see. I just put it up."
2,Substandard at Best,"Far and away the weakest Pretenders album. Most of the songs come across as little more than Chrissie Hynde with a bunch of studio musicians and while a few songs such as the glorious ""Sense of Purpose"" manage to shine through the otherwise mundane proceedings there is a good reason why this remains the sole Pretenders album out of print."
3,It's good poprockmusic.,"The first song i heard by S.Mullins was ""Lullaby"", and that's a good song, both instrumental and the lyrics. One of the best songs of him is, ""Shimmer"", that's really a great song. It has a great video, and the music and the lyrics is also very good. The new album is also good, he's doing great poprockmusic, he's a storyteller, and has some things in common whith other artists like, M.Knopfler, Chris Rea, Tom petty, and similar artists, there're all good storytellers, whith interesting music to, but they're NOT boring, like willie nelson and johnny cash, these two guys is boring, thats my opinion. Nice title, and frontpicture to. Well, this album is not the best record of the year, but it's good enough to buy. This album is the right way to making real music, it's pure Music. /Thanks. Bye."
3,Great for Giveaways!,"I bought several of these to use when I make my cheesecakes for others (I get requests for them a lot). They are perfect! They also last about 4 cakes, before they start rusting and leaking...so that was a bonus. Highly recommend for give away pans."
1,Don't get mixed up with it!,"...In just about 3 months after that its zooming lence after a crackling sound jammed, I had it replaced and... guess what!... after about a month I had the very same crackling sound and jam. I changed out it to a less expensive Canon PowerShot A200 camera. It may look ugly, but it works and pictures are great what really counts. Doesn't it?If you don't want to have trouble with cameras, stay away of HP PhotoSmart 812. Thanks"
1,Stay away from this camera!,"I bought this camera about four months ago after reading some good reviews, boy were they wrong! For the price, the resolution is good, but I expected better. The macrofocus does not work well at all, and I have a hard time getting a picture off indoors. The ""no red-eye"" feature just makes you have ""green-eye"" instead. I would not recommend this camera to anyone. Go buy a Canon instead, stick to those companies that know something about photography."
4,loving care lotion,"This is the only hair color that I can use. It works for me since I have no other option because I am allergic to other hair color. Unfortunately, Clairol has opted to discontinue this product because I was told it had a small market share. Shame on them, because there are other people like me that are allergic to hair color, and once the supply runs out -we are out of luck. I am very angry that the bottom line has once again become a priority and I hope they will reconsider taking the product off the market.I was able to purchase 6 packages on Amazon but many internet stores are either out of stock or much higher priced since it was discontinued by Clairol."
4,Good product,This does work really well to cover grey hairs if you have only a few greys. I use medium brown the most. If you leave it on too long it does tend to leave a coppery bluish tint to your hair but it's only noticeable in the sun. I wash my hair everyday and this lasts me about 2 weeks (using a mild shampoo for colored hair).
4,The book for Dream interputations,"I like the detailed descriptions, easy to use and fun to research my dreams with."
1,Too light weight,"The four pound weight is too light. When the weight is lowered below 20 feet and you troll at 2 knots, the weight does not go straight down but at a 20 to 30 degree angle. You will not know how deep you really are. I am replacing it with an 8 pound weight."
1,Mike and the Bike,"I was very excited to get this book for my son. The story is good, the CD is good. The binding of the book was out of whack and went right throught the pages at a 45 degree angle. The pages were immediately ripped. It was very dissapointing."
3,Read the manual? Good luck!,"The VCR is fine, but figuring out how to program the beast is a nightmare. Essentially the manual says one thing, the on-screen instructions say something else, and what actually works is still something else."
4,Excellent rendition of Carnatic Music,"Trichur V Ramacahndran excels in rendering swaras. In this CD, a carefully selected mixture of songs brings out the best features of this vocalist. Devaranamas of Sri Purandara Dasa (Sakala Graha and Dharma ShravaNa-raaga Durga), Bhajare Maanasa of Vaasudevachar, Naraada Muni of Sri Thyaagaraja, and Kurunilai Tharuvaay (Tamil devotional) are the five songs in this CD spanning around 60 minutes."
2,Mostly Harmless,"Did you ever wonder what Anthony Ruivivar's singing voice is like? Did you ever want to listen to Sean Hayes caress a Mel Torme tune? The answers to these and other unasked questions can be found on this NBC-themed Christmas CD.(It was a charity production for the Children's Miracle Network, so I feel like I'm kicking out some poor kid's crutches. Please consider donating directly to the worthy charity of your choice. That takes care of my guilt; back to the review.)The CD-ROM enhancements may be the best part, with interesting video tidbits from Martin Sheen, Katey Segal and others. About the music, to be positive, some tracks sound like they weren't recorded by amateur singers.If you can pick and choose the bits you enjoy, this CD is worth maybe two stars. If you just pop it in the CD player for your holiday party, it could clear the room."
2,Save your cash,"It's for a good cause, but it won't be good for your ears. These kindly folks whould just stick to their day jobs. However, if you need an ego boost, when you sing along, you will actually sound better than those on the CD."
2,The Official Myth,"Come on. This is John Lennon as the myth-makers want him remembered. Lots of good, interesting information in here, but it is obvious it's a whitewash. My advice...read the good, bad and ugly books on John, (you can skip Goldman's), shake well, pour, and you might get a somewhat accurate portrait of the artist.I liked the book by the guy who stole the diaries, but liking it doesn't mean I believed it totally. Disliking this book doesn't mean I think it's all B.S. It's just that this book was written by his friend with input from Yoko's publicist. I had a hard time finishing it, I really got tired of the gloss."
4,Refreshing,"I am a big Mark Knopfler fan. This has great complex compusure and you can feel his unique riffs intertwined into music. A mixture of rock and traditional folk, different but familiar."
2,Be Careful,"I thought I read the material very carefully before I purchased this DVD. I thought the format was DVD-Audio because that's the specific search I conducted, but the format is actually DVD-Video. Also, I read in one of the reviews that the disc was Dolby Digital compatible but it's not (it's DTS). As such, I couldn't appreciate the 5.1 surround sound, which was the whole point of my purchase (as well as to serve as an introduction to the great Hector Berlioz). Couldn't return it because I opened the package. Oh well."
1,"Ug, stupid and not worth the money!","This book says nothing useful, and not much that isn't an anecdotal stereotype. Save your money!!"
3,"If you can slog through the first third of the book, it's worth it","It's hard to know what rating to give this book because the first third of the book was awful. The writing was so immature. It sounded like a totally unconnected adult trying to write like a teenager and failing at it. I really didn't know whether I would get through the book. But I usually like Printz award books. And, after 100 pages, the wannabe-a-cool-teenager speak ended and it got really exciting. I really enjoyed the last two-thirds of the book and it made toiling through the beginning worth it. I'm not sure how connected the author really is with teenagers. I'm a decade shy of my teen years myself, but as a teacher in both middle and high school, the inauthentic language was really a turn-off (as was her lack of computer knowledge)."
2,Aquiring Signal issue is a reciever quality problem,"My Starmate is increasingly displaying the ""aquiring signal"" statement. This is not a signal problem but is some kind of internal electronic quality issue. Problem for Sirius owners who sign up for life time membership, is that you are only allowed three changes in equipment. So poor quality equipment like my Starmate becomes a major issue."
2,EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED,"I'm already sick and tired of getting an ""ACQUIRING SIGNAL"" on the screen of my Starmate. I was already dissapointed that I had no choice but to take the antenna out of my window, but even still when I let my antenna hanging outside I still get that annoying ""ACQUIRING SIGNAL"", and I have no choice but to move the antenna around until I catch the signal again.The programming is great, but I think that SIRIUS better get SERIOUS about improving the quality of their signals. It is definitely not fair that people pay over $100 dollars for a receiver, plus the $15 of activation fee, and $13 a month for weak service."
4,A sister is not always a Sistah....no loyalty....,"This novel was interesting and will keep your attention. Some parts were predictable, but the twist was there also. I really thought that BJ was going to turn out to be different. Ezola was terrible and the twist with her was good. Phoebe was a trip calling all those in her mothers journal. It was interesting and I really enjoyed it, I do think that it could have been expounded on a little more, but it was a page turner and just watching everything unfold was good. I also thought that Sam's secretary was going to be the one to tip everything off, but finding out how it unfolded was good. I think that Pearl Cleage did a good job on this story and I enjoyed it."
5,Respecting the narrative of women's lives!,"Thank you Pearl Cleage for allowing me to celebrate my womanhood and the men who recognize and respect US. The line ""Respect the Narrative of Women's Lives!"" speaks volumes to those of us who cherish our womanhood, our specialness, our place in this world as the protagonist and her circle of friends in ""Babylon Sisters"" do. You and Catherine challenge those who want to destroy all that is vital to us and our daughters to do the right thing for ourselves and our daughters. I believe that my daughter is finally ready for your books so I am going to give her all of them and have her read them in order. Continue to encourage us to challenge all that is wrong with our world through your narratives about proud women who do the same."
4,A Pleasant Novel,Ms. Cleage wrote another excellent novel. It started a little slow but as you read you start to really get to know the characters and what they are really like. The heroine was a strong woman who many can relate to. My book club enjoyed it as well...kudos Ms. Cleage!!Founder - Rennaisance BookClub
4,FATHER BROWN......THIS MOVIE GROWS ON YOU!,This is a very funny movie that seems to get better the more you watch it. DeNero and Penn are great as two escaped convicts posing as priest to get accross the border into Canada. Try it you'll like it! Very funny with an excellent cast.
1,Zero for Three,"So far I've purchased three of these keyboards. One for a personal laptop and two for work. All three came in broken. The first had a key pad missing and a broken part that supported the key. I was able to take a key from my old keyboard and replace it. The second had key pads that were separated in the package. After clicking that key pad back into place I found that the space bar did not seat correctly resulting in the space bar working only partially. The last keyboard came out of the box in three parts, the keyboard, the cable connector and what appears to be a retaining clip. It also appears to be used."
5,Works!,It was easy to install and had no problems using it. Look for installation video on YouTube. Package arrived a little bent but keyboard was ok.
1,Don't bother!,"While the style and colors of this stroller are really cute for a little girl, it is a real piece of junk!! Not sturdy at all, very flimsy and too lightweight. Bought this for my 18-month old and I should have listened to the other reviews. The dolls DO NOT stay in the seat and the seat belt is too difficult for young children to manipulate that they get frustrated with it, as do I. Why Fisher Price didn't make a more hammock-type cloth seat on this is beyond be. Also, no basket on the bottom either. Put your money to something a little nicer."
3,My Daughter Loves It!,"My daughter got her 1st little mommy doll for her 1st birthday. She couldn't walk yet and I hated walkers. But I went and bought this stroller and it helped her to learn to walk in less than a week. She loves it! However....the wheels don't roll to well on the hardwood and one continues to fall off. But for the price and it is adorable. The whole reason I bought it though was because my husband and I called her ""little mommy"" from the time she was an infant and I saw the doll that said little mommy and then found the stroller too. Had to have it! Past that not too thrilled."
2,Not so great,"It seemed like a good stroller in the store, we have had a few cheap fabric umbrella doll strollers that ripped (my kids' are hard on stuff!!) so I figured with an all plastic seat we would be good here. Not so, the wheels constantly fall off, we have lost one of them so now the stroller is no good. The seat belt comes out and is a frustration to me to keep putting it back in.And it doesn't fit any other dolls well, if you have a lot of small dolls it's ok but only one of my daughter's dolls fits in here. It's fine for a short child as a first stroller, maybe in the 1-2 year old range as long as they have help putting the doll in it. Otherwise save a few bucks and just get one of those $7.99 umbrella strollers Toys R us sells!"
2,It was great while it lasted,"My daughter got this when she turned 2 and she loved it... however, it only lasted about a week before it started to fall apart and I think I threw it out after a month because it was in unrepairable pieces."
2,Try a different stroller,"Our 18 month old puts her doll in the stroller, but because the seat doesn't recline at all, the doll quickly slides out. There is a velcro strap to hold a doll in, but she can't always manipulate that very well. A cheapo umbrella stroller works much better and holds several dolls at a time."
4,Love the Little Mommy line of toys,"Our daughter, whom just turned 6, still plays with ALL of her Little Mommy toys. She has 3 dolls and all of the strollers, beds, carriers etc that are in the Little Mommy line. I would recommend this line to anyone with a little girl that loves to play mommy!"
5,My little mommy loves to stroll her baby in this stroller!,"My 20 month old recently received a Little Mommy doll and the Little Mommy stroller. She loves both of them!!! Wherever she goes her baby has to go with her (in the stroller). She feeds, her in the stroller, she brushes her teeth in the stroller, she does EVERYTHING with her doll in this stroller. The stroller seems to be pretty durable, my daughter has actually sat in it and then threw a fit because she got stuck and nothing happened to it. The Little Mommy doll is also the perfect size for her. So glad we got this for her; well worth the price and is providing lots of entertainment."
3,falling apart within minutes,I bought this because in all the advertisement it looked rather average sized. It is very tiny good for the very young 2 and 3 years old. The wheels pop off with one push. And the seat belts come out. Only the small dolls will fit.Very disappointed in the fact the wheels won't stay on. Instead of playing we are always putting them back on.
2,Fun but flimsy,"My two year old daughter absolutely loves this toy, but the velcro doesn't stay closed and the frame is always popping apart. I am very disappointed in the quality and have rethought buying any more of the ""little mommy"" pieces."
4,Very Cheap!!!,"I bought this stroller before my daughter's second birthday, hoping that it would hold her over for a little while. It didn't take ten minutes for the front wheels to fall off, and the seat to come apart from the stroller. It tips VERY easily, and even a small toddler has to bend over to push this stroller. I wish the photos represented the strollers true size better, it will only fit a 9-14"" doll. Not worth the money, even for the price. The Graco umbrella stroller is a much better buy for less money!"
3,Servicable biography of this great American composer,"Being a fan of (some of) Barber's music, I was interested in finding out more about him. I suspect an academic will find this book satisfying - it goes through his works in scholarly detail - but I found it uncompelling. I think the main problem is that Barber was not a particularly interesting guy - you will find no juicy tidbits here. Where this could have been interesting is delving into his personal life - but it doesn't venture there. I was disappointed. By the way my favourite Barber works are adagio for strings (of course), violin concerto, and the school for scandal overture."
2,Old-fashioned and not recommended these days. Be wary!,"While I did use one of these for my first two children at the recommendation of my mother for getting the babies to ""sleep through the night"" at two weeks, they are not recommended these days because a newborn's digestive tract is too immature even for cereal at that age. My third and youngest did not taste solid food until he was 4 mos old (the recommended age) and was breastfed exclusively till that point, but still managed to sleep through the night at only 1 month old.I would advise caution in using these as a ""sleep aid."" They do work for that, but my second child was very colicky, and it could have been feeding her cereal in one of these, trying to get her to sleep through the night, that contributed to her colic, or at least it's duration."
2,The pieces just don't stay on the board.,"I bought this for my 2-year-old granddaughter, thinking she would enjoy playing with it during a flight layover while travelling, and it's very ""packable"". The little animals are cute, and she enjoyed naming the animals and putting the ""babies"" and ""mommies"" together, and making the animal sounds. Only problem was, the pieces just didn't stick very well at all on the so-called magnetic board. We left a trail of pieces all over the gate at the airport. We've had other magnetic board toys of similar type & size that held the pieces far better than this one but still allowed the pieces to be moved around. There are much better versions out there..."
4,"An important book, and worth the wait!","I believe this is the first comprehensive English language guide to Croatia and has been well worth the wait. The author has put a lot of effort into the book, and I especially enjoyed the short special features in boxed text throughout the text. The history is a great guide to a complicated country. I have always been fascinated by this part of the world and I certainly am even more inspired to get out of my armchair and see it now."
4,Great album,"This CD is totally different from their first four albums. The album has more melodic sounds. 'Hey Angel"", ""Lock Up The Wolves"", gave me more interests. Dio vocals are not shout anymore, but it seems that he don,t want to scream anymore. I guess!"
3,Dio - 'Lock Up The Wolves' (Reprise),"Decent follow-up to their 'Dream Evil' effort(see my review).Dio's fifth record.As I recall,'Lock Up...' was the last Dio album in which they were playing medium to larger size venues.Some fans might remember this piece as when Dio reportedly went through about 5,000 audition tapes to find the RIGHT guitarist for this lp,a 17 year-old Rowan Robertson.Too bad he wasn't on any other Dio albums.Plain and simple,a good old school heavy metal reissue.Key tracks include the upbeat ""Wild One"",""Hey Angel""(nice guitar solo),the should've been a hit ""Night Music"",title cut ""Lock Up The Wolves"" and ""Walk On Water"".Line-up:Ronnie James-vocals,Rowan Robertson-guitar,Teddy Cook-bass,Jens Johanssen-keyboards and Simon Wright(AC/DC)-drums.Check it out."
2,Better Than Dream Evil but Not Quite Right,"So at this point Dio was just re-shuffling his lineup from album to album which most of the time isn't a good thing. He found some 18 year old kid to play guitar on this one and added a former AC/DC drummer as well. While there are some very good songs on here like ""Wild One"", ""Lock Up the Wolves"", ""Walk on Water"" and ""My Eyes"" for the most part it's a pretty boring album. Most of the songs are the same mid-tempo rockers that Dio loves to do and they don't really contain anything memorable as far as riffs or melodies. I'd recommend this one over Dream Evil but just barely."
2,One more case of the missing guitar player,"As Ronnie got further and further away from the COMPLETE guitar players of Ritchie Blackmore and Tony Iommi, the more his solo albums suffered. The series of Viv Cambell speed/thrash/shred/look a likes began to make every track on the album sound like the next. You end up hoping for a decent ballad to justify your money. But unfortunately on Wolves, its just another guitar PLAYER. Blackmore and Iommi were PLAYERS and COMPOSERS. RJD just needs to find himself the right axe man (Hey Ronnie - Tony isn't doing much these days) and with his pipes and lyrics, we could still get some more 'magic' out of Dio."
4,A surprise!,"This album really surprised me. I had almost considered not getting it. It seemed with every album after Vivian Campbell, he had another new guitarist. But it's Dio! So I got it anyways and man, it wasn't a mistake. Sure, there aren't any awesome solo's and songs that just plain rock, but it's a well put together album and very worthy effort. This album didn't seem to get much attention, but that was a mistake. It is a very good, but not great album (there will never be a Dio album that compares Holy Diver and Last In Line unless the original lineup gets back together). A must for Dio fans."
3,It was okay,"I expected more from a PBS video. I have had a hard time finding a good documentary of the Greeks and was not satisfied with this one. It was okay, but I am still looking for one that covers Socrates more thoroughly."
3,All the details without the Big Picture,"This is an engaging story of the Greeks told in a continuous timeline, but from a strictly modern point of view. It presents a superficial history of battles and personalities without ever animating the Greek spirit. This program will tell you what happened, but not *why* it happened. The most important thing about the Greeks is their view of the world, which is only lightly touched on - mostly focusing on Socrates, who is not a typical exemplary of Greek thought (but he is an exemplary of *modern* thought). Plato and Aristotle are only mentioned. It is fine as a battle history, but turn to something else like Edith Hamilton if you want an idea of what the Greeks were about, or in what sense they truly are the ""Crucible of Civilization""."
3,What about The Spartans????,"The series is entitled ""The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization"". The Spartans were totally neglected in the second episode with regards to the wars with Persia. If I'm not mistaken, the Spartans were Greek as well. Perhaps the miniseries should have been titled ""Athens: Crucible of Civilization"".Philip Neidlinger"
3,METTLACH STEINS,BOOK IS OK AND PROVIDED INFO I WAS LOOKING FOR GAVE PRICES FROM THE 1970'S WHICH COVERED JUST ABOUT ALL MY STEINS
1,Disappointing. Save your Money!,"I bought this book to add to my collection of Cold Fusion material (Ben Forta books, Mastering Cold Fusion etc.) but I was most disappointed. The author hardly touches upon any real principles and the examples are shown as miniature screenshots which you need a magnifying glass to read! Why not use the standard ""fixed width font"" code listings everyone else does.This major failing of the book makes it hard to gain anything from it and I sent it back for a refund.Buy Mastering Cold Fusion 4.5 by Arman Danesh instead : he's vastly improved on the earlier version and corrected most of the negative areas commented on by reviewers of that book to deliver a superb reference work which demonstrates real-world CF examples that you can learn from.The only people who MIGHT benefit from this book are: a) people with Bionic vision or b) people who want a vague overview of Cold Fusion's capability.A much better Beginner level book is Cold Fusion 4 for Dummies."
3,Worth a look zombie fans! Thanks Media Blasters!,"You already know if you're interested in another Italian zombie flick ... you don't need me to discuss the merits of this gut munching festival of fear. Be aware that it is one of the final entries in the boot's obsession with zombie adventure, and therefore a minor entry. Media Blasters has been so kind as to release a slew of these gems to DVD, and for that they have my undying thanks. The extras alone are worth the price of admission and I urge all fans of the genre to take a look. For so many years we have been forced to watch third and fourth generation copies of these films. It is a relief to have pristine prints of these anti-classics available at long last!Note: Jeff Stryker, the famous gay porn star, is the male lead in this production. Just a little trivia for you fans out there!"
2,Generic Early 90s White R&B,"Tommy Page...known to many of us in the late-80s and early-90s as ""THE SIXTH NEW KID"" for his frequent hob-nobbing with New Kids On The Block.His music is pretty bland r&b; and pop. Not offensive by any means, but not very noteworthy, either.Tommy guest starred in several NKOTB videos, appeared at many of their concerts, and had New Kids show up in his videos and do background vocals on some of his album tracks."
4,"Good use of unpublished diaries, other material","This book was quite useful for my research. It has a lot of detailed anecdotes, taken from material in the IWM = Imperial War Museum. It has one chapter each year, but also has chapters on training, zeppelins, naval aviation, Gothas (the attacks on London, I assume), etc."
3,Classic Design but too thin,"I like Mundi's design, I've bought them before. This version is very thin kid leather like vinyl. I woudn't have bought it if I had seen it first."
4,Overall it's nice,The wallet does not have the clear picture holders so I took mine from my previous wallet. Overall it's a nice wallet; however I did find it for less online so I was disappointed about that.
5,Excellent,"My wife love this one, real leather, big in but small out, cute, really a great buy for the last Christmas."
4,"Tidy, Pretty","Love the material, the color is less minty and more sage than the photo may show, and it is tidy inside, just what I looked for for a long long time."
5,Lots of organization space,I love the fact I have lots of spaces for all my grocery store cards! I can organize all of my reciepts and still have a place for my check book! Definately what I was looking for.
3,"Looked nice, but arrived damaged","This looked like a nice wallet, but mine arrived with a big scratch on it. I don't know if others have had a problem with quality control on this item. I went through the hassle to send it back and order a replacement -- am hoping it will be in new condition."
3,Slightly disappointed,Have to say that I carry a large wallet now that holds everything I need. It is starting to fall apart so I was hoping this wallet would satisfy my needs. This particular wallet only has a zipper compartment in the side that zips while the wallet I have has side pockets inside the zipped area so I am not going to be able to use this new wallet as well as I used my previous wallet. It's not a bad wallet just wish it had more options inside it. For its size it doesn't utilize the space well.
1,This is NOT Leather,"I purchased this item based on the website description that it is leather. When it arrived, it was abundantly clear that it is plastic. It had a horrible odor and a tag on the inside indicated that it was made of PVC in China. I believe that this description will soon be corrected by Amazon so that other customers are not similarly misled. It should be noted that this item is sold and shipped by a marketplace seller and not by Amazon."
3,it's ok,"this wallet is ok, a little expensive, but I am not too disappointed it. I which the wallet was all leather, but is only on the outside and the material inside isn't soft. the inside is rough and hard the credit card pockets are a little small and takes a while to get them inside the pockets, but the wallet has lots of space and I can have pictures in it....but i which was a little cheaper because of the quality isn't super good. I purchased black color"
2,Not as advertised,"I ordered the Mundi Big Fat Flap Wallet and got the Mundi Big Fat Wallet. The difference is the Mundi Big Fat Flap Wallet has a place for bills in the top zipper compartment, the Big Fat Wallet does not. I have had a couple of the Big Fat Flap Wallets and have really liked them, but didn't like this one. I really think someone in shipping picked up the wrong wallet or they don't know the difference."
5,Really great harmony,I can't say enough about this group! The harmonies and arrangments are so unique. I love them. I think if you like celtic music you will be impressed.
3,Confusion of phenomenology and existentialism.......,"I wouldn't reccomend this Introduction to beginners. While it does offer an interesting comic book style history lesson into the arguments of/between existential phenomenology and phenomenology, it moves so quickly that the subtle differences between them seem blurred as the subject changes from page to page. If this book is used, I'd reccomend supplementing it with some other introductions into both existentialism and phenomenology. I'd reccomend Existentialism: From Dostoevsky to Sartre for an Existentialism only introduction. I'd then reccomend further reading into phenomenology, the main difference being that phenomenology tends to believe that all concepts, not only objects, can be proved indefinately. Although, Husserl differed from this, leading into existential thought. (bah!!! confusing)......."
2,Breaks very easily,"The device has two major drawbacks, the first is that the earpiece hangs off a thin bit of plastic that quickly breaks off. They clearly realise this is an issue as they give you a spare, but that is no good when they only last about a week each.The other big problem is that they both have multi-function on/off buttons instead of a switch. This means that getting the thing turned on is about 30-45 seconds since you have to push and-hold-the-stupid-thing-down for a very-very long time. The sender is worst of all, that has three modes, off, standby and in use. In practice the standby mode is completely pointless, you might as well turn the thing off completely since it will take ten seconds at least for the thing to make a connection to the earpiece - often much longer.There have to be better designs out there that this turkey. Once the gadget feature is worn off you will be back to using the phone alone."
4,GREAT PRODUCT FOR SERIOUS EDITING,"I am not a realy serious photo editor, but so many people have said that this is such a great editor so I went ahead and coughed out the 600 dollars. It is a little pricey , but to the serious editor, the usefulness outweighs the price. 7.0 is probably the best version yet. However if you have 6.0, I would recommend saving your money for either the next version or waiting a little while for the price of this to go down. The only complaint about the product is the price. I know that it is really good, but for 600 bucks it is a little much. I suggest that they make one for home editing with features that are somewhat scaled down, since the average home user does not need this much power. Overall I recommend this if you are serious into image editing. And don't be expecting to know how to work the software in the first hour. It could take days of time sitting in front of your computer to figure out how this works. But it is worth it in the end."
1,A monster!,"For those of you who had version 4.0 or 5.0, it took a little time to get the hang of it, but, it is a good photo/video tool. This version 7.0 is so huge and so technical, and soooooo different from the earlier versions that unless you want to become a professional, or have tons of time on your hands to relearn everything you figured out already, but without additional benefits (that i could discern)i advise you to stay away from this monstrousity. In a way, it's like the new MS Office, you don't get any expanded functionality, but must re-learn a different way to do what you have already been doing for years. My Photoshop 7.0 is in the trash. It belongs there."
1,Cheaply made and over priced,"The gloves are giant and do not fit my hands. The coating on the right glove is double the thickness of the left glove and since I am right handed this makes them to bulky and impossible to grip anything. I will be returning them. I did not test their chemical resistance so I can't rate them on that, but they are covered in neoprene. I paid extra for the brand name and am dissapointed in the quality control eventhough they are made in the USA. I hope you have different results."
3,Spotty but some songs really good,"I enjoy about half the cd very much. The rest I can take or leave, a bit non-folky or repetitive."
5,If you like golf and love to laugh buy this book!!,"Bought this book for a cross country flight and found myself laughing outloud in the airport!! My wife was truely embarressed!! An intriguing look at golf from the view of the municiple golfer just dying to get to the other side - ""the private club"". Trust me, you will not be able to put it down!"
1,This One's Shanked,"I bought this expecting something much wittier, and less like rejected lines from Jay leno's monologue. There are about 3 jokes per page, and each one is telegraphed by Western Union - meaning they're all at least 90 years old. Reilly seems to have potential - it would be nice if he didn't fall back on faux folksiness all the time."
3,Does what it's supposed to,"Lube-N-Walk does what it says it will; lubricate your treadmill. I use it on my treadclimber per the recommendation in the manual. It's fairly easy to use, but just a touch sloppy."
2,terrible product,I have a very nice treadmill and I have to keep it lubed - I got a lube the belt message and went to dicks - they suggested this product -- first it is very messy half spilled all over the place -- My 16 year old and I coudldn't get the tread mill to get rid of message I have a horizon t 500 ---- my husband played with it and had the message go away and it seemed like it was ok everything seemed ok it worked for a couple of weeks and now treadmill is not working -- I am ordering horizons kt much cheaper --- this thing seemed like it got oil every where but where you wanted it --
3,Maintenance kit seems incomplete,"Yes the kit has everything described and the material and items do accomplish the job to do. For someone who does not use this regulary, I did not realize that I needed to purchase precleaning fluid. Also the bottle with the lubricant is not marked as it show in the directions which makes it harder to guesstimate the actual amount you are using. Read the description to make sure it meets all of your needs."
3,Its okay.,"I used it and it worked. My treadmill needed a little more work than just a lube job, so its hard fo rme to know if this product did any good or not. It certainly didnt hurt."
3,CHARITY 101,"Are you constantly receiving requests for donations? Are you in a quandry about giving? How does one know which causes are worth supporting? Do you find it difficult to decide who is and is not deserving? ""The Ethics of Giving and Receiving"", is somewhat like a crash course in charity and benevolence 101, in that it explores how to do good wisely. You may or may not agree with the stated assertions, but you will find them interesting. For example, - philanthropy should be linked with justice which creates standards for wise giving; those responsible for their own misfortune should be sent to the end of the receiving donations line. On the other hand, empathy and compassion is needed to guard against being too strict and too judgemental. Join the debate, read the book. It was written for an audience of intelligent inquirers. That's you!"
2,Very 80's,"It's a fine album if you are a fan of 80's music. It is reminicent of Bryan Adams and other 80's groups. I did not like it due to the fact that it didn't seem so original in sound or feel. But, if you are an 80's rock fan, this album would be a good purchase for you."
2,It's Typical 1980s,"There's not a lot here unfortunately. And it's hard to decide which direction Jude Cole is going here. There's a hit of a Mellencamp-esque roots approach (could have something to do with co-writer George Green) but that is glossed over by a late-80s production of keyboards and slick guitars that would later be known as ""adult contemporary rock"". It's a bit of a corporate piece that's hard to pinpoint vibe-wise."
2,"Got this a while ago, and let me warn you.","The artists rock, but there are just remixes of nice songs on here. The songs are bad remixes, adn if u want a real taste of these artists, buy their own cds, with the orignial songs, which are better. I don't know what these songs have to do w/ Dance With Me, except they are in Spanish. I like some of the songs on it, but I have most of them already. Don't waste ur money!"
2,When it works sounds/ looks great,"In shop many times, takes long time to read disc sometimes won't read at all says "" no disc"" finally told me board was bad after warranty was up. Yamaha service sucks"
2,Too big,"This is much bigger than what I wanted for myOlympus C-4000. It would be OK if I had a lotof accessories to carry, but for just a camera,extra batteries and a smart card, it's too bigand bulky. The case does appear to be verywell made and should provide more protection than astandard leather case, so if you have a lot tocarry, you may want to consider it."
4,Thanks from Germany,"Thanks for sending us this book to Germany. It takes a few days time, but it was OK - like the discribtion. THANKS."
4,A good book for information but needs to be updated,This is a good book to add to your collection but it is in need of an update!
2,Bless This Mess,"Most of this album is just not that great! Vogue is the sole bright spot, but i'll admit that Hanky Panky, More, Something To Remember and What can you Lose are O.K. If you have not been exposed to any of Madonna's albums before, don't let this be your first! Go buy Music, Like A Prayer, or Erotica (my personal favorite) instead!"
1,Musical Excrement...,...would have been a better title for this video. There is nothing funny about this man! He's not clever and tries to grossly overcompensate for it.
5,Silver Belles!,"Silvery harmonies and traditonal arrangements have earned The Christmas Travelers a permanent spot in my holiday play list. Christmas in Carrick is probably the best Celtic Christmas song I've ever heard (and the best version of that song--Eric Rigler's mini-reel is brilliant).Some of the selections are Celtic (Carol for an Irish Cabin, Christmas in Killarney, etc.) but most of them are just good old fashioned Christmas favorites. This is definitely not one of the group's more sophisticated efforts, but it's got a homey, friendly feel to it. You can hear the smiles in the voices. Hearing CT come on my CD player is like seeing a good friend at the door."
3,Don't expect a happy ending.,"Well acted, engaging characters and a storyline where you want to see the lovers attain reparation for all of the suffering they had to endure. If you have compassion for all of the characters, there will be appropriate closure; but don't expect a happy ending or you will be disappointed."
4,Perfect,"I saw this movie here in my country, Brazil and fell in love with, so i wanted this dvd so much.It's a great(and tragic) love story, that everyone should take a look."
2,Incredibly Unromantic Romance,"2.5 Stars. This is a real mixed bag. It is beautifully filmed and acted, but at the same time it hops around so much in POVs and time sequences that you lose your way - and interest. What's really going on and what is purely imagined? Even though this is integral to the story itself, the final payoff -- which you may find yourself tapping your toe awaiting -- is more, ""Are you kidding me?"" than ""Wow!"" American audiences may also find these emotionally straightjacketed Brits so intolerable that you'll want to scream, ""Jesus Christ -- just tell her you love her already and kiss her!"" Then there's the assortment of accents, some of which are so thick and mumbled I had to turn on the closed captions in order to understand them.'The English Patient' this ain't. More like, 'Better Be Patient, 'Cause it's English'."
4,They should kept the original ending,"After a lifetime spent in hobnobbing with the high and mighty, complete with a queen audience, Briony has atoned for nothing.The conclusion was contribed. In the original version the book is never to be revealed in the lifetimes of the people involved, and I am sure her grand nephews and nieces would have quietly deleted the book from Briony's computer to save the family reputation.Either way, they are the winners, who will feel no remorse and no atonement while gladly spending the money gained from the proceeds of Briony's final book, while the line of Robbie has died out for ever."
1,Is it over yet?,This movie was so slow moving I had to struggle to stay awake. The movie is just one big disappointment.
3,"Tragedy of the year, is more like it...","I'd heard over & over again that this movie was the most romantic movie of the year... Even that it was the next The Notebook... WELL, I am here to tell you that it is a very, very tragic tale, & I was SO disappointed going into it, thinking I was going to see a beautiful romance... It was very sad, & although it was a good movie, it left me quite depressed. There are no happy scenes between this couple, & although they may have loved each other deeply, their romantic relationship consisted of about 15 minutes, & the rest of their live's were riddled with tragedy & hopeless despair! Their dreams never come true! I spent the entire movie waiting for the 'part that would make it all worth-while,' & alas, the end brought nothing more than disappointment (that these two people's lives were totally ruined). If you want a hopeful romance... This is not it, but if you want drama & tragedy, you've come to the right place!"
2,No bueno,"They could have told this story in 20 minutes, the Dunkirk scene was way too long, the fact that his true love threw him under the bus cannot be overlooked. NBD"
1,THE GO BETWEEN???,"OK, anyone remember that one - Julie Christie - Alan Bates??Originality ....originality .... everything seems to be recycled upon an unsuspecting YOUNG public today.Performances? Certainly they are great in this motion picture .... but DO stay calm and reflect upon originality?Poor Redgrave .... someone soon must get her a proper script - something befitting her superior talent.Keep on trying ....."
1,Much too long,"This might have been a better movie if it were much shorter. There's a story in there somewhere, but its buried in scenes that look beautiful, but do nothing. I could barely understand the actors, especially Knightley who spoke too fast and mumbled. The exception was Vanessa Redgrave, who almost rescued the movie in the final scene."
2,hard to believe it got 7 Academy Award nominations!,I'm a sucker for a romantic movie but Atonement was long and boring. Actors speaking cryptically with foreign accents does not make a movie intruiging it just makes it hard to understand. And beauty does not replace good acting (Kiera Knightley).
3,"Looks beautiful, but lacks any spark","The first part of this film is gorgeous. Its a great opening to an intriguing story. The characters really appeal to you, the acting is incredible, the imagery, lush and realistic. But then, it all falls apart. The middle and especially the end parts all feel disjointed, almost as if they were an entirely different film. Now, I love romantic, tragic dramas and was really excited to see it. But I must say, I left feeling dissapointed. I am not saying I was looking for a happy ending, or a grand conclusion, however, I was looking for a solid gut-wrenching, awful-in-a-good-way type of ending. And after it ended, I just didn't feel anything. I truly felt nothing for any of the characters after everything was said and done. I am giving this film 3 stars however, because I really loved the first part of the film, and the musical score is actually outstanding. Its one of the most beautiful scores in any film. Too bad the movie didn't really match it."
4,great movie,"I got this movie to share with my parents, sadly the sound was a bit low and they couldnt hear the most of it. The movie is a good one. The ending was unexpected. Glad I bought it."
5,Atonement DVD,I ordered this DVD at a great price. It was delivered immediately and in excellent condition. I would definetly order again.
4,Safe Period Fare,"An infuriatingly safe period drama, this film is a textbook adaptation of a novel, complete with a stunning array of costumes, landscapes, and music. If it falls short in any department, it's performance, for there's little risk involved in the production, yet Knightley and McAvoy manage to carry their share of the load on the way to the Oscars. (8/10)"
5,"Excellent story. Well-written, funny, poignant","I am so sorry this book is over. It was a pleasure to read. Thad Ziolkowski is such a wonderful writer. His story is witty, eloquent, and moving. I have never had much interest in surfing, but that didn't change my enjoyment of the story. I particularly relished the parent-child dialogues and the amusing, self-deprecating recollections of childhood cognitions."
2,A dead fish gains the power of observation,"2.5 stars - I am a big Joy Electric fan so naturally I was interested in this Ronnie Martin side project. No blips and bleeps, this album is mostly acoustic with some analogue synth to spice up the tracks. The unfortunate thing is that it sounds like a bunch of Joy Electric toss offs stripped down or late 90's Starflyer 59 songs that were pulled from the trash. Ronnie's voice is better suited to Joy Electric's sound. The usually fantastic Frank Lenz adds little to the mix to help.At nine songs and 25 minutes, you kind of feel cheated if you paid full price. But the that's the Martin brothers philosophy. Too much music gets boring. If you've ever been to a Joy Electric or Starflyer 59 show, you know what I am talking about. They rarely play more than 30 minute sets.If you loved ""Unelectric"", this album is for you. If you are a rabid Joy Electric fan, you will probably be disappointed."
5,The Flute of God,"I have read The Flute of God about ten times over the past twenty years and with each read get more and more from these writings.Paul Twitchel brought Eckankar, The Ancient Science of Soul Travel, into physical reality in the 60's. Eckankar, the study of what Is, was taught underground for several thousand years prior to now.All religions sping out of What Is, or Truth, and this book will help one understand what Truth Is. An amazing work for an amazing time."
1,pablum,"sad,sad, sad. sure, the band is tight, but these tunes have no soul, grit, humor or anything close to innovation. any one of them could be something they did better before, with the possible exception of the title track. blech!"
5,Excellent phone,"1. Awesome speakers... best of breed.2. Awesome mike... while using loudspeaker.. my friend on the other side prefers that I use the loudspeaker mode. Way too good.3. Excellent GPS. The extra resolution on the inside screen helps when you're viewing maps. Plus, the keyboard is exactly what you want when typing source and destination addresses.4. Little too thick, but since its packed with features, its a good trade off.6. Good reception. Voice clarity could be a shade better, but its not a show stopper."
3,Backpacker--Great. But lacking details.,"If you're backpacking through AU you'll probably love this book. But you'll love Lonely Planet even more. Its a decent guide to AU and brushes on the best parts of AU while doing a great job on the ""touristy"" parts. Lonely Planet is much better.If you are looking for ""decent"" eats and stays look elsewhere.If you want SCUBA reccomendations, don't go here. But for a cheap stay in Cairnes, try the ""Great Northern"" hotel."
5,From cartoon to national symbol,"This is the season when The Simpsons really came into its own as a show. The character development really began, as we were introduced to so many of the most important ones. The animation was much cleaner, and the storylines were more developed. One of my all-time favorite episodes is here, Lisa's Substitute (guest starring Dustin Hoffman). I think this is really the point in the show when people realized the Simpsons were no no flash in the pan, and its the reason they are still around today. The commentary on the episodes is great as well, and the extras in general are very creative. If you're a diehard Simpsons fan, you have probably already bought this. If you're only a casual fan, buying this will turn you into a hardcore one."
4,Good but not great,"These episodes are entertaining, but the extras are nonexistant. Next time I would be happy with episodes, commentary, tracy ulman skits, and possibly video of the actors doing the voices in the sound booth. I also read that there are Barbra Bush letters somewhere on the dvd but does anyone know where?"
5,A Simpsons Fan's Delight,"Season 2 of the Simpsons is where the show settled into its winning form. Having the whole season of shows available full length (the shows in syndication are shortened somewhat) in DVD format was enough to sell me on this set. The video is crisp and vibrant. The audio is fine as these are the pre-stereo shows. The audio commentary ranges from okay to hilarious and includes much insight into the creation of the show. Finally, adding in the little details, from the packaging and the extras to the animated bits in the menus, makes this DVD set a 5-star recommendation for me."
5,Homer's Version of the Life Cycle,"I purchased this at the last minute when I realized I had forgotten the video of this episode I show to my class on models of the life cycle in the world's religions. Now I never have to remember a physical object: I just log onto the classroom computer and show this to the students. Perfect! It's not HD, but that's really not necessary when viewing a 25 year old animated TV show.Regarding this particular episode, I think this is one of the greatest ""Simpsons"" ever, containing some really hilarious lines (e.g., Dr. Hibberts saying ""You have 24 hours to live--well, 22. I'm sorry I kept you waiting so long."" then Homer launching into a riff on Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's five stages of grief) and also a surprisingly profound exploration of what matters in life. Well, in Homer's life, anyway. If it's good enough to show upper division college students, it's good enough for you, no matter who you are."
4,If you haven't seen these...didn't miss much in this season.,"I thought that this season wasn't all around that hilarious. True, the show was at its early stages. If you're looking to collect program's entire collection of seasons, then by all means buy this one. But please don't buy this one just to see theses episodes. They weren't all that fun to watch with kids, as were the other later seasons."
3,Arbatov's The System,"A peculiar book from one standpont, a serious lack of modesty in the author. There are many photos in the book, and EVERY SINGLE ONE is there to show Arbatov in the company of one or another famous personage. The captions each call attention to Arbatov and only incidentally mention the world leaders who are in some of the photos."
2,CD Inside Label - Missing CD,"I was disappointed when the book arrived with a big ""CD Included"" sticker on the front cover and an empty CD pocket on the inside cover. The product description didn't mention a CD, so I wasn't expecting one...however, I didn't expect a big, non-removable sticker on the front cover with an empty pocket on the inside. (I ended up burning my own CD to include, as this was a gift.)"
2,Beware of battery cover -- too much plastic,"While this camera may indeed produce good pictures, I was disappointed from the moment I tried to start it up. It took me 15 minutes (and I know my way around cameras) to put the lithium batteries in without breaking the very difficult to use, very plastic, very breakable battery cover with a plastic hinge! I did not break it on the first day but I was certain that it would break at very short point in the future and that I would be stuck with a high end, expensive camera that would have to repaired (4-6 week wait usually). Not worth it. Plus I was certain that a better camera would be developed in very short order at a cheaper price."
1,I would give it ZERO stars if I could,"This camera may have the HP label, but it certainly does not adhere to their usual quality consumer device. The camera is very slow with a poor quality LCD screen. The user interface is not intuitive and can be quite confusing. Button placement is questionable, with the capture video button directly next to the shutter button. Too easily the shot or video can be missed. Image quality is a joke. The images produce far too much noise and color representation looks to 'cartoonlike' and unnatural. This camera produce images that may be able to compete with a sub-par VGA camera. The sensor in the camera is the problem. I would search hard to find out what company's sensor is in the camera and make sure I NEVER buy a camera with their sensor inside.My recommendation is to save your money and buy another brand of camera. Do your homework."
1,You'll regret every moment you waste watching this movie,"I am a huge Highlander fan, especially of Adrian Paul and the television series. I watched this movie for free when it debuted on the SciFi channel and forced myself to suffer through it. I had to believe that they would have some real payoff for making another movie, but I was wrong. The story is beyond horrible. You'll find yourself questioning every plot point and director's choice while wondering if a room of drunken monkeys could have made a better movie. Read the Wikipedia entry for the movie to see the troubled history of bringing it to market and satisfy your curiosity of the plot. All the performances were mailed in and the director must have been on peyote during the whole shoot. I was wondering if anyone in the production company had ever seen or remembered any of the good Highlander product that was produced. Stay far away from this movie."
3,"Highlander 5 - not the best one, an OK movie","I am a Highlander Series fan, got all the seasons, love the saga. I like the movies, 1 & 4 the most. In Europe the movie is already available for several months. I also heard a lot of bad things about this release so when I bought it, I did not have very high expectations and maybe that's why I feel Highlander 5, which was certainly not a great movie, was an enjoyable movie. Good to see Macleod, Methos & Joe again"
1,Where Have They Been?,Has the writers and Director ever watch any of the Movies or the show?One of the magic of the show was the flash back. In this movie the flash back was all black. WHAT UP? FANS deserve better!!!!!
1,perfect,"in michael jackson terms......some decent concepts, but a terrible execution.next please........."
3,Just okay,Big fan of the Highlander series and Andrian Paul in general; but sorry to say this movie was that great. Fight scenes were sped up and there really wasn't much of a story. Really enjoyed the Series but the only good movie was the first one. Sorry. Really wanted to love it.
1,"Hey look, a new version of Highlander 2!","This movie reminds me so much of Highlander 2 it is not even funny. I have always said that I like Adrian Paul as the Highlander better than Christopher Lambert. Christopher Lambert's movies are a complete hit or miss (you either love them or you hate them). Adrian Paul's TV show was the pinnacle of the Highlander franchise in my opinion. Then, Adrian Paul made this, his very own version of Highlander 2. The movie is about as good as rock is able to float. It is not as good as the TV show (neither the story or the FX's), or any of the other movies (except maybe Highlander 2). Most of the back story is missing and the ""Source"", well I don't spoil movies, but you will be left thinking, ""What? Is that it?"" I am not going to say don't buy this, but you better have seen the first 4 movies and the TV show, or this really isn't going to make any sense."
2,Faulkner?? Not quite,How anyone who has read Faulkner can compare this book to his works is beyond comprehension to me. This book was average at best--certainly nothing approaching a classic. The protagonist is a cold-blooded murderer--yet this fact doesn't seem to bother anyone--least of all the author. The worst part of this novel was the amateurish gimmick of having Therese's mother tell her whole life story to her daughter over hot chocolate one night. Much easier than trying to weave those facts into an actual plot I guess. This book was a waste of my time.
5,splenda book purchase,excellent transaction; very satisfied. great book of dessert recipes which I can use for my diabetic husband who has a sweet tooth.
4,Perfect airplane read,"Corporate Attorney A. Scott Finney has it all; he was a college football star, now a highly successful lawyer with the beautiful wife, smart daughter, living in a huge home with three high-end cars making lots of money. After giving a bar association speech, Scott is asked by a federal court judge to take on a criminal case of a young heroin-addicted prostitute accused of murdering the son of a Senator with White House ambitions. What Scott first believes will be a simple plea-bargain for his client becomes much more complicated and live altering when the accused insists she is innocent.Mark Gimenez debut is a definite page turner. The characters were interesting although, for the most part, stereotypes of the worst types, but that doesn't mean such people aren't real. The plot is implausible. Not being a lawyer, I can't speak to the legal aspects. It was, however, a thoroughly engrossing, entertaining read. This is the perfect Sunday afternoon or airplane book."
4,Very Entertaining!!!,"It's not a deep and philosophical commentary on life, lawyers or race ralations and I don't think that it was intended to be. It is simply a fast-paced and very entertaining fiction novel. Color of Law would be a great book for your next flight, cruise,etc."
5,Mekhaye!,A particularly delicious story! My reading group and I enjoyed every moment! What a joy to have such a wonderful new author to look for in the bookstores. Congratulations on a splendid book.
5,Honest and Enjoyable,"Mr. Lankford does a wonderful job explaining what Wicca is and what Wicca is not. He understand the ins and outs of this religion and is able to clearly explain it for anyone to understand. If you are Wiccan and have family who want to know more about what you do, this is the book to get them! This author comes across as a person who knows how scary it can be for someone to hear that a loved one is Wiccan or a Witch. He does a fantastic job of helping them through that fear by providing them with the information for a better understanding of something they've only heard scary stories about. Ignorance breeds fear and this book will definitely put an end to anyone's ignorance about Wicca/Witchcraft!"
2,NOT IMPRESSED,READ THIS BOOK AND WAS FRANKLY DISSAPOINTED. NOTHING NEW IN IT.THE ABOVE TWO REVIEWS WOULD SEEM TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY MATTS MUMMY AND POSSIBLY HIS PUBLISHING COMPANY AS WELL.THE CELEBRITY ANGLE WILL DOUBTLESS SERVE HIM WELL WITH SALES. ALL I CAN SAY IS THEY MUST BE EASILY PLEASED
2,The first of many,This is the first cd put out from the great Buju B. He sets the tone of his work and style with songs like Stamina Daddy and Quick. This album is the one that first Buju on the dancehall sence. The amazing thing about the album is he was only a teen at the time.
2,Don't waste your money,"This DVD shows basic stretching excercises for sitting, standing and laying down. What this video shows can be retrieved by a Google search on 'stretching' for free. Though yoga incorporates stretching methods into yogo routines, (to me) this DVD is not yoga. I've taken yoga classes before and they were much more robust than this DVD. The DVD spends little time on breathing techniques, which is a big part of yoga. Save your money and do the Google search..."
3,Not my favorite Sheila E. album.,"I like Sheila E. -- But, long story short, this is not her finest work. It's good, and proficient, and has a lot of funk and fun, but it's just sort of flat in parts. It doesn't MOVE like her previous albums did.I do like the little gag at the beginning of the album, though. Very cute, Sheila."
3,she wolf,"I must admit it is B movie series but the storylines are fair. The acting a bit corny, but enjoyable. They condition of the dvds in very good shape."
5,Awesome!,I've been waiting for years to have this show on DVD. It is an amazing series and I'm so happy to finally add it to my collection. A must have for horror fans!
2,Somewhat disappointed.,"I was not aware that this show was so old. I thought it might be a newer show from somewhere like England or Australia. I am not sure if I missed it in the description, or if it was not mentioned. This show is over 10-20 years old, and was not great. I watched a few episodes and then stopped."
3,Not everyone is 100 years old and Chakaholics but...,"...this is a good starting point for someone who wants to get a glimpse of what Chaka has done. Look, the cd packaging clearly states that the remixed songs are remixes. And perhaps someone might want to hear the og versions and buy I Feel for You which is a good thing. Personally, I loved the remix of Eye to Eye. It is the quintessential slow-house groove. Not all of the songs on the remix projects were gold but they were interpretations of fans and (then) current producers. And I am happy to write that I bought Chaka's self-titled Japan import CD in the early 90's. Anyway, if someone wants a glimpse of Chaka's work, this cd is a good place to begin."
2,Cutting board,"The cutting board looks nice, but is far too thin and after a few days, it warped. One of the glued on feet fell off."
4,WILD VIOLETS BY RUTH BAKERFIELD,"THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK FOR ADULTS WHO LIKE HORROR NOVELS. THIS IS ..NOT.. A CHILDREN'S BOOK.... I BELIEVE THE REVIEW ABOVE IS FOR A PHYLIS GREEN'S NOVEL ""WILD VIOLETS"""
4,The seventies personfied- and thats a good thing,"'St Dominics Preview' is a wonderful collection of seven diverse songs. Within that framework though, Van Morrison creates some of the most majestic, moving and astonishing pop music I have ever heard. The twin masterpieces of ""Listen to the Lion"" and ""Almost Independence Day"" are so daring in length and fully realised in their musical execution that listening to them simply transports you to another place and another time. The reason I love Van Morrison's music is the rewards you receive every time you listen to his amazing and diverse music and this cd is no exception. Give it time to grow on you and you will be richly rewarded."
4,Lulu is a true performer,"Lulu Roman has one of those full, distinctive voices that is undeniably unique. I had no idea she'd recorded so many songs over the years, nor did I know she was this good! My favorites include ""King of Who I Am"", ""Heaven's Watching"", ""All My Life"", and ""That's The Man I'm Looking For"". Anyone who is a fan of Lulu's, or of Hee Haw, or of gospel music will love this collection."
5,MJ as philosopher,"Most of us think of MJ as a great entertainer. But I suspect few of us consider him a great thinker. This book which contains his poetry, short essays, and a couple of his songs will, like his music, touch your soul. His thoughts on Courage, Innocence, Love, and God are very profound. His beliefs about saving the planet come through very strongly. I gain new insights every time I read a selection."
1,A Nauseating Exploitation of Deceased Screen Idols,"A concatenation of ""research"" that is touted (but not demonstrated), in contradiction to most reliable documented information and apparently libelous in the extreme to two individuals (and their respective spouses) who, deceased, are not able to defend themselves. Whatever fantasies Ms. Rich has concocted to suit her own notions of romance, I cannot see how this book can be classified as anything but fantasy--and a sick one at that. As a genuine fan, I am disgusted."
3,Amusing,"It was amusing, but you have to realize when the author lived. That way the humor and comments make a lot more sense and bring humor to what would not, necessarily, be humorous today."
4,Stickshift Annie Revs My Motor!,"Corporate graphic designer by day, blues singer by night, Stickshift Annie's versatility as an artist shines in her debut CD. Annie's chameleon-like voice changes color to fit the various blues, jazz, country and occasionally folksy surroundings. Hubby James Middlefield's aggressive and swarthy harmonica is a stylish accessory to the slidin' & pickin' Ian Waldie and Ed Martinez. Annie's emotional and passionate connection to the lyrics (mostly a veiled diary), seasoned with solid instrumentals and arrangement, create a flavorful if not extravagant work.Out of Her Mind is straightforward and professional, but not unoriginal. There are no spectacular cuts, but you won't be tempted to skip over any of the ten offerings. I found myself listening to it over and over again in my truck the first couple of weeks I had it. Not because I had nothing else to plug in, I just didn't tire of it."
3,Great content...,"It's such a great thing to have a documentary on, but then whoever put it together used such tremendously horrible music choices that it seemed as if it was a angst-ridden tragedy instead of a story of triumph. There were several scenes that were filler, long slow scenes of driving... where there's nothing adding to the story, it's too long to be 'making a point', and they could have done a better job. So A+ for the information, the backstories, the look at people's lives and careers.. but D for the actual product in the end. SOrry... I wish I loved it."
5,The only way to go!,"I have been using an epilator since 1989. This is my third Emjoi Epilator. It is far superior to others that I have tried over the years. The multiple rows of tweezers make the job quick and easy.Prevents ingrown hairs, and reactions to creams and razors to sensitive skin."
2,Disappointed,"I bought my Emjoi epilator two years ago, and I hardly use it. I was really thrilled about getting one at the time, but I didn't find it practical enough for me to use it on a regular basis. Other reviewers have commented on it's poor ergonomics, and they are right. I can never grip it comfortably. I do not have problems with the tweezing being too painful, but I do have to go over the same area multiple times for it to pluck all of the hairs. Sometimes I just find it easier to use my handy no frills tweezer. This isn't a product that I'd recommend to anyone."
2,Get the Emjoi Gold Caress instead,"When my Emjoi Gently Gold Caress broke (after years of use - I whole-heartedly give it five stars), I bought this, thinking more expensive means better. This was unfortunately a bad assumption and I really wish I'd just bought another Gold Caress.The Optima doesn't fit well in my hand and the cord often comes out while I'm using it on my legs since my hand is brushing up against the spot where the cord is attached to the epilator (if you're going to make a non-cordless epilator, make the cord permanently attached!!!). Also, because it's a bit uncomfortable to hold, I am not always able to hold the skin of my underarm taut and the skin gets pinched (one time it drew blood).In the end, I do still use it and it is better than the Braun I bought in between the two, but I wish I had the Gold Caress instead. It fit well in my hand and because it is cordless I could use it without an outlet nearby."
4,Best of the Emjoi lineup,"I owned the Emjoi gently gold caress for about a year before upgrading to this model. It is much faster to use than the single rotating tweezer model. Of course that means it's pulling out hairs faster, so I found it a bit more uncomfortable. Still, the time saved was worth it. I recommend this for anyone who wants to use this type of hair removal."
2,PAIN,"First time user, just can't stand the pain! So thank goodness it comes with an electric razor head, to bad it does not work real well. I would of been happier with a good electric razor for the money! If you can stand the pain it does pull those hairs right out, if not try somthing you will enjoy for awhile!"
3,Ouch,"Works really well but hurts. I have a pretty high tolerance of pain and this was tough to bear. It feels like someone is scratching and pinching your skin all over. I'm DREADING doing my underarms. If you think you can handle the pain and discomfort, I'd say it's worth it."
4,Less hair...finer hair,"The first time I used this product, it hurt...A LOT. However, I soon learned that shorter/trimmed hair diminishes the pain factor a great deal. I love this product b/c it gets rid of underarm hair, and the regrowth is often finer and easier to get rid of. Just be aware that it will take a few hair growing cycles to notice a real difference. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends."
3,"Nice photos, but not the most accurate text","Very nice photos -- particularly the abundance of color. Given the title, though, its surprising that at least a third of the book deals with Indy's early days. Interesting historical context, but not totally on point.There are a number of minor inaccuracies distributed throughout the book, particularly regarding misspelled names. Also, much of the core 1960's narrative draws heavily on Leo Levine's Ford -- The Dust and The Glory. At times it reads almost like a book report. More seriously, there is at least one instance that borders on plagiarism: in describing Jim Clark's initial impressions of the Indianapolis track, the author says that Clark found it a bit dull. From Clark's autobiography ""Jim Clark at the Wheel"" Clark states (referring to the same) that ""overall I found it a bit dull."""
4,awesome camara,"I bought this camera around christmas time, I wanted a digital camera to take some pictures with and one i could use on the web.This one is really nice,pictures print out real nice up to 5x7 or so then they begin to look a little shabby.Oh it does like batteries. Ha Ha Ha.But it's about the best all around camera for the computer."
3,"wrong information,wasnt brand new","the inside is great,all the pages are intact,but the cover has damage.back and front.they look like puncture marks,and this wasnt in the info.for my help in further purchases i need more information about items.this was shocking to see,and wish i was informed before purchase."
4,the guy is frigging great,"I personally love this, right up there with excitable boy, almost as good as ""warren zevon"". Moody like all his stuff, with each track smoothly moving on through complex emotions of love, etc."
5,"When Hard Rock was near-dead, along came Roth","I was impressed with previous reviews, this album is arguably the best post-Van Halen album, dished up at a time when the bottom was falling out of the hard rock scene. Dave's lyrics make the album, but unfortunately those less gifted failed to understand the Diamond One. His wit, charm, attitute, positive vibe, and creative know-how shine on, and even today the album sounds as fresh as could be. It was a kick in the guts to Eddie Van Halen and his cronies. Sam was always an average talent anyway. ALAE introduced Jason Becker, a phenominal talent, who's musical influences stretched far beyond the regular 'Eddie-rip-off' guitarist.A great album, a great feel, from the emotionally strong Tell The Truth, to the nostalgic, smoking, epic Drop In The Bucket. And who can forget the title track! What a blast, Dave style. ""Was vaccinated with a phonograph needle one summer break...""Dave lives his life the way we all should, as if it were our last day on earth."
1,Game Will Not Install,"I am running OS X 10.7.3 and the game will not install. I have contacted MacSoft so we will see if they can come up with a solution. I would not recommend you buy this product if you have a newer Mac. This game will not work with Lion. Below is the response I received from Technical Support:Unfortunately, Wheel of Fortune 2nd Edition is not compatible with OSXLion. When the game was developed, Apple was using what were calledPower PC processors. They have since switched to Intel processors, andran a program called Rosetta to allow PPC software to continue to work.Unfortunately they made the decision to remove Rosetta from OSX Lion.Because the box was printed between 2003, it does not reflect the change.Destineer/Macsoft SupportDO NOT BUY IF YOU RUN LION ON YOUR MAC!!!"
2,Prehistoric beauties that live by the code of the jungle,"The only intelligent animal in the movie, a colorful parrot, narrates this simple story of love, lust, and bedrail. The main pair of wild women looks like white trash in leopard skin and black. They dislike their uggy local tribe's men and may just have to hogtie some men from another tribe from the south. They swim in a large croc pot, or legume of crocodiles, tempting the croc gods like leggy snacks.Bad acting and stilted duffus dialog do a comedy not make. It is a croc.Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death"
4,Gardens in Winter,"This out of print book was delivered quickly, inexpensive and most appreciated. It is the ""go-to"" book for several professional landscape designer friends."
3,Not as good for words,"Alphabet blocks are a wonderful thing. But these aren't as good as either the MYKIDS set or the Melissa&Doug set, for one reason: those have different letters on opposite sides of a block, so the A block is also an N block. These have the same letter on three sides of one block, so with a set of 50 there are a lot of letters that appear on only one block. When a child wants to spell a word, odds are you won't be able to do it with this set. GIGGLE? Nope, only one G. BIG? Yes, but not without taking apart DOG. DIENCEPHALON? Ok, I'm being silly. But you get the idea."
3,My hair was nice and shiny for the ...,"My hair was nice and shiny for the first few days after I used this product. I've noticed that a lot of color washes out when you wash your hair, so it fades quickly. The odor was average for this type of product. I'm not sure I'd use this one again."
4,Wowee-ed and Zowee-ed,"Somehow I missed the greatness of this CD when I gave it a first quick listen years ago. While Slanted & Enchanted, Crooked Rain, and Brighten the Corners always found their way into my CD player, I somehow let this one languish on the shelf virtually unlistened to. What a mistake! As a Pavement fan, it ranks only a hair below S & E, which is no small feat considering the strength of the non-stop singles worthy songs on S&E if the radio actually played Pavement songs other than Range Life and Cut Your Hair, that is (not that those aren't great tunes, I just wish they'd mix it up a bit). If you like Pavement but don't have this one, you're in for a treat. If you hate Pavement, well you're probably not reading this, so I'll leave you out of it. Now where's that damn ""Westing by Musket and Sextant"" disc . . ."
5,WOW,Absolutely Amazing. The amazingness of this concert rivals the central park concert which was undoubtedly DMB's best. the intro to say goodbye is phenomenal and the addition of the new songs is something that I've waited for since there premiere at the start of the summer.
1,Totally opposite of what I expected,I am a Christian so as soon as I read enough to see that this was not what I believed......I deleted it !! Crazy ideas !!!
1,Only ONE good song on here,The only good song on this album is I'll Take Care of You.. if it were 1990 I would have paid the $13 for the whole album just to get that song! It is by far my FAVORITE Ray Charles song...
5,What's Done In The Dark,I honestly can not put this video away. We watch it consistently every weekend for sheer laughter. The whole family enjoys it.
1,HATED IT !!!,"Wow this was a terrible play !! I agree with what another reviewer said about the portrayal of black women in this play. They were loud, gossipy, ignorant at times, and just plain messy. D'Atra Hicks (Jackie from the Family Reunion play) was in this. She was so strong and reserved and classy in Family Reunion, but I could barely watch her here. She looked terrible and she was loud and obnoxious. And maybe this was how Tyler wanted her charachter portrayed, but it only lends to my belief that black women were portrayed in a negative light.I stopped the DVD at about 15 minutes at first, and then I restarted it and just fast-forwarded through the moments D'atra Hicks was on stage.All-in-all I just hated this play."
2,okay,It was okay. I expected better. I'm a huge fan of Tyler Perry's productions. I didn't really like this play.
4,Mr Brown!,"You know, any movie you put Mr. Brown in is an instant hit. You will find yourself fast forwarding to his parts! The acting is funny, especially by the nurses, and the Men are very easy on the eyes :). The story lines are easily predictable and could use some creativity, but I love the stageplay."
5,Classic Collection,when I was a Kid this was my first introduction to Sam Cooke.His Vocals&Writing are timeless.His Voice covered a wide range of styles&Continues to Influence Generations upon Generations of Artists.His Tone alone was so clear&Clean.He was a Singer's Singer.He is a Mount Rushmore Artist.truly One of a Kind.
1,Bad book a hoax,"This book advertises one thing and delivers another. The advertised on the cover: standards, Regulations, and Financial Reporting is nothing but a compendium of written articles. If I wanted that I did not had to pay close to US$ 100 to get them. I was ripped off!!!!!"
2,"Buy the 12""","I was very disappointed. This band basicall sucks except for the 12"" version of Teen Love which isn;t on this CD. Save your money, buy the 12"" Single and have it converted to CD somewhere."
3,GAve it a 3 though 2 of the stories were excellant...,"Give the C ater Street Hangman a ""10"".Would love to see more inspector Pitt Videos...but there are none.The Four Feathers was a good story too, and would recommend watching it.As for the other two....Lady Audley's Scret and Poldark....I was unimpressed with Lady Audley....and felt like we were left hanging at the end of Poldark."
3,rainy day entertainment,So far I've watched the Poldark video. It is good but just not long enough to get a really good feel for the characters.
1,THIS BOOK IS SO BAD!!!,"This book is so horrible it doesn't even deserve 1 star. It's about a kid named Nora who is really smart, but she hides it because she wants to have friends because being popular is the most important thing in the world, not going to a good college or getting a good job.Sometimes I think this book was written in a dumber age. I get good grades and so do many of my friends. I can't think of someone I know well who gets grades as bad as Nora when she pretends to get bad grades. You should just be yourself and not pretend something just to be popular. BEING POPULAR IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD!!!"
5,Well done Andrew Clements!,"Andrew Clements is my favorite author! In his books he keeps the readers interested throughout the whole story. I am 11 years old and I can't stop reading Andrew Clements' books. All of his books are fantastic! About ""The Report Card"", I think it's one of his best books. Read this book! Happy reading!"
1,Should've stayed skeptical & passed,"I got this via the Gold Box offer and I was able to use this two, maybe three times, before it stopped working altogether. And when it ""did work,"" it DIDN'T! I got no curl in my lashes and I was EXTREMELY disappointed. Unfortunately, I'm now stuck with it, although I'm considering sending it back to the manufacturer to try to get it replaced under the warranty. Who knows ... maybe it really is a dud, and they'll send me one that really works. But if you're skeptical to begin with, don't bother buying this. Stick to the typical manual curler."
2,Didn't work like I though it would.,"I have really long eyelashes. And besides lipgloss and eyeliner, my other essential item is my eyelash curler. I thought this product sounded like a great little invention. HEAT of course should set and curl your lashes all day. But after opening the package and using it, it didn't work at all. It did a good job of separating my eyelashes, but nothing else. I say go for your old fashion eyelash curler. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS KNICK KNACK."
1,are you kidding me?,"Bought this item since it was in my Gold Box. Have tried it on 4 different occasions and my lashes looked no -- NO -- different. Passed it on to a friend thinking that maybe it was just me, but she threw it in the trash a few weeks later I can only surmise that the many positive reviews on this site were written by Emjoi employees... Don't waste your money."
4,Works well for what it is,"This small unit works as advertised. It is meant for a small area or to supplement a larger unit. It is fairly quiet; you can hear the fan but it's subtle. The external transformer (inline, not a wall-wart) runs hot to the touch; if the unit runs in an unattended area I would only leave the power pack on a tile or metal surface, or propped up to provide airflow.The unit arrived in a timely manner and the seller enthusiastically requested performance feedback about both the unit and the delivery. I am quite satisfied and would recommend the unit."
2,Product Life is Short,"I bought this dehumidifier thirteen months ago, and it seemed to do its job well for about six months. At the six month mark, it began having problems collecting moisture, which seemed odd because the unit was operating (turning on, fan woring, receiving current, etc.). This unit was placed in a high-moisture area and just seemed to have a mind of its own, randomly alternating the days it decided to and not to collect moisture. After ten months, it simply stopped collecting any moisture whatsoever."
2,"good base, lousy reception","After installing this system including the base unit, caller ID unit, 900Mz cordless broadcast unit, and 2 handsets, we found the base unit to work well enough.However, if you plan on using the cordless capabilities, you will be very disappointed. The people on the other end of the line will swear that you sound like you are on a cell phone with constant breaking up and static. Try dialing a number is next to impossible on the handsets as well, because half of the numbers you hit will not register as tones when you hit them even though they display on the LCD.After 3 days of frustration, we bought the Panasonic KX-TG4000B 2.4GHz Four-line System and we are extremely pleased with only ONE base unit that does the work of the Brother's 3 separate systems. Also, the longer range with the 2.4 GHz compared to the 900Mz is appreciated by all.If you are looking for a 4-Line Base unit and nothing more, this unit might work for you. I have an extra one to sell (only 3 days of use)."
1,Horrible Phone,"After 3 months of use, these phones just konked out on us in the middle of a busy time. They crackle and pop loudly. Of the 3 phones we ordered, only one was useable 4 months later. And it was a major pain in the neck to return it on-line, with no telephone number on the website to speak to anyone about it.S."
1,displeased,Purchased 4 brother phones about 2 years ago. wiring the phones was simple enought and they seem to work fine for about a year. Now two phones works sometimes. display and intercom trouble on one and speakerphone works sometimes and not other times on second unit.I will not purchase a brother phone again
3,I had to return the 12 phones,"This type of phone would not work in out building because we had over 600 feet of phone lines.....we are assuming this was the problem, as we had everything else checked.\So sorry they did not work as we liked the phones.\\ thank you. I hope you have credited our account with the return. Faye Handley"
2,Avoid this one,This cd is not mad sin's first cd chills and thrills is. The songs are good but the sound quality is so bad you cant hear anything. Get god save the sin or any other one from raucousrecords.
3,pretty satisfied,"This is a good, basic score book. the biggest perk is the number of games that can be recorded in the book. there are two drawbacks that I can think of: 1 - the space allotted to write player numbers for the line-up is small. I prefer the boxes used in the Big Red Scorebook. Also, there is no place to write down your roster."
4,Cool,"Its a fun thing to goof around in. It doesnt really stay on your head, and its near impossible to hide your hair in it. Its cool, but doest work as well as the picture makes it seem."
5,Tons of fun,One of the best gifts I purchased for my grand-kiddos - they loved it - we have the silliest photographs now - it brought tons of smiles. Well made - sturdy - you can't loose with this :)
2,Doesn't stay on,It's a nice concept but it doesn't work like the picture shows. It doesn't stay on at all!
3,Not the TV soundtrack,"Caution. The previous reviewer may be confusing this album with the original Peter Gunn TV soundtrack recording which is due to be released in June, 99. The number ""The Brothers Go to Mothers"" appears on the soundtrack album but not on this one. If his review does refer to the soundtrack album, I unreservedly agree with him; it's a great recording of big band West Coast cool jazz."
3,Good action movie,I havent seen a very good action packed movie since 48 hours. This one was full of it. If you like army-swat team movies then rent it. The plot is easy and there are a bunch of guns.
2,swatty,If you want to see Collin and Michelle in topless/sports bra punching bag sceenes for like 3.5 secs...its the flick for ya. If you want to be entertain w/ a lil something more then eye candy...keep looking
1,This movie stinks,Collin Farell can't act for sh....I saw this movie one a VCD...think god I didn't pay 8 bucks for a ticket for this crap in a box...What a dumb film...Samual L. Jackson saved it....Movie sucked pretty much.....Horrible casting...Worst then Phone Booth...Acctually Phone was worse then this........they both suck pretty much...I wish i could give it a -000000/5...Worst movie I've seen last summer...Later...
4,actiontastic shooter movie,"Filled with action, twists & turns, and a really hot Michelle Rodriguez. Definitely a guys movie."
4,MY GRADE: B.,"For it's genre this is fun well paced film. Story centers on a SWAT cop, Jim Street (Colin Farrell) who has been removed by an unreasonable boss because of a not so good hostage situation. Flash forward six months as SWAT is reorganized by Sergeant ""Hondo"" (Samuel Jackson) and Street is invited to the crew.The characters are the stronger than the overall story but the story is good enough.Based on the 1975 TV series of the same name and also starring LL Cool and Michelle Rodriguez.The budget for this picture was $80M and it made over $207M at the Box Office. Although it did well no blockbuster style sequel was planned thereafter, just a direct to video DVD, ""SWAT: Firefight"" which included a totally new cast.STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B minus to B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B; ACTION SCENES: B; WHEN WATCHED: end of August 2012 (streamed); OVERALL GRADE: B."
4,Action? What action?,"I don't expect action movie to be something more then a pure entertainment. I can swallow lack of logic and I can deal with stupid characters without any personality. But there are some things action movie needs like air that is action. Explosions, escapes, fighting scenes, some tension, few surprises and good soundtrack. It's not much, isn't it? So why oh why was I denied these simple pleasures here? ""S.W.A.T."" is so boring. There are few action sequences but very unimaginative. Everything is obvious and plain that you just want this stupid movie to end as quickly as possible. I like Farrell, Jackson and Rodriguez but in ""S.W.A.T."" any piece of wood could do their job. There's no acting, there's no story there is only too loud, badly chosen music. Shame, shame, shame"
3,Good Cast-Good Action,"SWAT is a good, not a great action movie. The opening scene is a take on a real life bank robbery, in which the robbers wore body armour and fired fully automatic assualt rifles. This is probably the most intense scene in the film. The rest of the film is pretty much Hollywood fare, with a predictable storyline and character profiles, examples: good cop(s) turn bad, evil drug lord, tough female cop etc. etc. etc. Samuel L. Jackson gives a credible performance as the leader of the SWAT team. Colin Farrell as the hotshot member leaves no memorable screentime. The film attempted to forge a middle ground between reality and super heroism, but remained as neither."
2,Good action with boring plot.,"I may be in a minority, but I really didn't like this film. The plot was boring, however the film had great action that was wasted. The cast had promise and didn't do that bad, the movie was plainly a flat out stinker. I thought the action scenes were wonderful, and that is what the two stars are for; but the acting just didn't impress me that much. The villain wasn't evil enough and was very weak, and we have already seen the ""partner that turns bad act."" I took all the good police movies and turned it into something cheesy and mediocre. Unless you are a fan of the cast, do not see this movie, rent another action film like the Rundown instead."
4,Either you're SWAT or you're not,This DVD inspired me to drop out of school and go into the Navy and eventually become a member on a SWAT team. Colin Farrell you're the man.
1,Piece of junk!,We got this last year for our children at Big Lots. They played with it maybe for about 20mins at the most. Things broke and got lost. I would strongly suggest not getting it.
5,***Beautiful***,"Julie Dexter is wonderful! Although the CD is only about 24 minutes long, it does well to introduce her to the American audience. In essence we get a taste of a brilliant artist and are kept on our heels for her full length debut release. Her style is smooth , jazzy, and most notably original. No samples on this cd. None of the standard ""Used by permission of Such and Such Recordings"". I predict that once the public gets a taste of Julie she will be heralded in the same light as Jill Scott! Her voice is angelic but the EP sounds like a vibe session cut way too short. Maybe that is what the intent was in releasing this CD! No disappointments with this one but I won't be completely satisfied until the full length arrives in my mailbox! Watson!!"
2,"At least it's got ""16 Tons""","I didn't know much about Tennessee Ernie Ford, besides ""16 Tons,"" but figured that alone was enough to give this CD a chance. It is a good value, and has a nice mix of songs. Unfortunately, I must say very few besides ""16 Tons"" interested me. By and large, the songs are overly produced, and lack soul. Ford has a great voice, and a few other songs are worth listening (like ""Milk 'em in the Morning Blues""). The album does what it claims to do, give you an inclusive collection of Ford's output, and if you like Ford, it probably won't dissapoint. But this CD left me cold."
2,can't play CD-R and a bunch of useless features,"I didn't even consider buying it simply because it cannot play CD-R. Audio experts agree that a DVD player plays CD better or at least as good as a CD player (due to it's ability to handle more complex data on a DVD). So a DVD is a great CD player also. However, the panasonic (Toshiba 1600 too) does not play music on a CD-R disk. My friend and I have dozens music CD-Rs that we burned from each others' CD collections. With many people burning music CDs these day, this is a bad omission. Also the inclusion of subwoofer jack is useless. Subwoofer should be connected to a receiver. If you connect a subwoofer to DVD player, then the subwoofer cannot be connected to other sources like CD player, VCR, etc. It's just stupid to include all these useless features. A good DVD player should have great audio/video performance AND simple."
4,DVD player good for the not so avid electronics fan,"Like everyone else i was excited to join the DVD hoopla, and as usual I jumped on the bandwagon. This DVD player fits my sytem perfectly. I have a DVD player, a VCR and a TV, I own none of this dolby digital crap and to put it simply I don't need it. This DVD player will work great if you're either not into, or don't have the money(me) for the extra recievers and speakers. It is easy to use and cheap. The start up time, picture and sound are all enormous upgrades from my VCR. I gave this DVD player only 4 stars because I fail to see the superiority of the Virtual Surround Sound. If you're just looking for a simplistic, affordable DVD player, this is it. One other suggestion, don't get suckered into buying the S-Video cable, it is a waste of money, just use the RCA cables it comes with, i fail to see a vast difference in the picture that the S-Video cable boasts of."
2,Disappointment,"The player plays only plays DVDs and CDs.NO CDR, NO CDRW, NO MP3. Purports to play VCD, but this is pointless since it can't play CDR.Most frustrating part of this unit is the time lag between power on and tray opening. Should take one second, but wastes about ten.Remote control is poorly designed and you'll be forced to turn on the lights to find any button. Multiple angle DVDs are very frustrating to use. Changing angles requires more than one button push.My Apex cost half as much and has many more features."
3,what kind of beast?,"I just finnished this flick,and I was entertained.Exactly what i wanted from an early 80's horror movie,the pace was good,the acting was decent,but what the hell was it.Someone please tell me was it an alien or just a weird bug/man creature that can be reborn thru rape victims .Someone fill me in or I will go crazy."
5,Lotsa Fun!!!,"First caught this film on HBO some years ago. Loved it. Since then have had it on CED, Beta, VHS, and now I'm anxiously awaiting my copy on DVD -- 2:35 ratio and all! It's definitely not for the young ones -- it starts off with a rape scene. Some may consider it dated by today's standards, but it's just an old-fashioned horror movie which holds up very well. Eerie, scary fun with a few surprises. Would never expect the all mighty Leonard Maltin to like it -- actually, I wonder if he even has any taste in his mouth!"
1,A Disappointment: No Mention of Prust in AK,"Me and Doris liked this horrible and severe text - but it totally omitted all notion of Proust's hard work in the bush leagues with Alaska's minor leage baseball ""Fightin' Eskimos"" before he went on to join the Parisian avant guarde of the early 20th C. If you want I can show you a picture of Proust at one of the early Idederod races, but this book is a waste of time if like me your key interest in doctoral studies is Proustian-Alaska biological lies.DO NOT USE THIS TEXT FOR THAT KIND OF RESEARCH!"
4,Question...,"I've read some of de Botton's other works, but having no prior experience with philosophy, was hesitant about this book, for the following reason: I know nothing about Proust. For those of you who've read this book, can you tell me if prior knowledge of Proust's works is necessary to fully appreciate this book (I have a feeling that it does). Thanks!PS. I just gave this book 4 stars b/c Amazon makes you pick one before you can display this message. I've never read this book, but 4 stars was the average rating, so that seemed like a nice, logical choice."
5,A Small Treasure,"I admit that I have never read Proust. Having heard of the books collectively called ""Remembrance of Things Past"", I had also heard that they were quite long and involved. However, after reading this slim volume I believe I might pick up Proust's masterpiece. What struck me the most about this book is the ability of the author Botton to find those small snippets of prose which seem to speak the loudest. One of my favorite parts is the attack on hackneyed phrases used by authors to describe things like the ""shimmering moon"". Proust argues that by reducing complex thought to such a rote phrase, man looses to ability to see the true object and make his own observations. I have actually started to apply this to my own life. I try to look at objects I see everyday and think how I could describe this.I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone with an interest in not only Proust but on the effect of literature on our lives."
5,Listening to Alain de Botton's Proust tapes changed my life,"And those of my friends, to whom I lent them. Perfectly recorded, and perfect for listening to in the car while confronting life's little obstacles: traffic, potholes, red lights, getting gas, etc. With the help of M. de Botton's guide to Proust, the path of life becomes clearer. A wonderful gift idea."
2,Zydeco CD,Not the best CD of Zydeco I could have chosen. It is not bad just not exactly the choice of songs I would have liked. BHamilton
5,GREAT CAMERA,I received my camera a week ago and I am very impressed with ease of use and options available with this camera. It takes great pictures. I am usig it to post pictures to the web. I have set the camera to it lowest setting which is all that is needed for web use (480x640) and with the 8mb smart media card included it will hold 122 pictures. I recommend getting a media card reader since it makes downloading quick and easy. Thanks Amazon for the customer reviews. They were a great help in choosing the right camera.
3,Good camera with some cons,"Pros: Cheap, great resolution, good flash, great size and weight, easy to use software.Cons: EATS BATTERIES! (maybe 5 photos using LCD but significantly more if using the viewfinder), zoom sucks (you have to hit about 5 buttons to get it to zoom 2x, and you have to use the LCD to do so--see previous comment).I decided to return the camera. I compared my camera to those of others on my trip, and so I decided to spend a little more and get a better one."
5,best for the money,"I looked at a lot of cheap digital cameras before my friend told me about this one. It had a good feature set so I bought it. I've been really impressed with the picture quality, especially compared to my friends with more expensive floppy-based cameras. It's also really small compared to those clunkers. It doesn't have a zoom, but night pictures and flash come out very well. I've been very happy with it so far--used it as my only camera on my trip to Hawaii with great results. Be warned, it goes through batteries quickly--we got some rechargeables that helped."
5,"""The"" choice in cheepo digital","This camera is truly easy to use, and it seems to be of reasonably good quality. The instructions aren't anything to write home about, but they suffice. The included software takes a little getting used to but it does do the job, just not as easily as some of the aftermarket stuff. The most amazing thing about this camera (compared to both 35's and other digital cameras I have used) is that it is almost impossible to take anything but a high res. perfect picture. The macro mode is fun too, and good for online auctions or any application where a detailed closeup is needed. I am very pleased with my purchase. The only negative is that the batteries do not last that long and either rechargeables or a transformer are needed."
4,A great camera if you find it at a reasonable price,"I've owned this camera for almost three years; it does everything you'd want a digital camera to do: Takes great pictures with reasonable quality, flash works well, settings are useful. Its weaknesses: 1) eats batteries for lunch, 2) serial interface is rather slow, 3) setup requires that you read the manual (and you'll need to read it again when you want to delete all your pictures after you download). Valuable options: The AC-power pack and a 32mb memory card. Do you really need a 3-megapixel zoom for $? Are you an avid shutter bug? No? Then consider this camera in the $ range."
5,A great camera!,"I have owned my D-360L for several months, and I love it! I have taken pictures indoors, outdoors, and in low light, and they all turned out very well. The images are sharp, and the colors are very accurate. The 1280x960 resoultion is more than adequate assuming you are not planning to enlarge small portions of the picture. Using the LCD display tends to drain the batteries rather quickly, but the money I save on film and developing pictures easily makes up for this. Also, don't expect to be able to use this camera without reading the instructions. In my opinion, the D-360L is probably the best under-$300 digital camera on the market."
4,Lovely,"I recieved it as a gift and was quite pleasantly surprised (although I asked for a point-and-shoot, not a digital.) The biggest problem I have with it is the lack of a zoom, although you artisically gifted and daring folks can do without that, happily. At times it CAN be slightly unwieldy, but whatever. Good times."
2,don't get if you have a mac,I am still waiting for their adaptor so I can download the pictures I took in July! It has been 3 months now. They said it was mac compatible but failed to say you needed an adaptor which they send you for free. They fail to mention it will take months before you can receive it. Also it EATS batteries. I am very very unhappy.
4,"Great Company, but Grade B for cooking","Grade B syrup is typically best for cooking, recipes, etc. I'd strongly suggest a Grade A Medium (some also like Dark) amber for that. Amazon carries Grade A Medium Amber too, from the same company.Grade B is honestly mainly for cooking, usually not to be ate directly. You can verify this on the company's website."
3,says Region 0 All Regions but it is not! Only available in pal format! Good movie though.,"I bought this on ebay expecting it would play for me as it was advertised on the back cover as an all region disc but it didn't as it was not an all region 0 all region disc! This movie is not available in ntsc format! It is available free to watch online though and it is not bad. I give it 3 maybe 3 1/2 stars as it is a decent movie ahead of its time but it isn't anything great. Neither as gruesome or as violent as I thought it would be but there is some gratuitous nudity and it is certainly a violent movie throughout just not as brutal as I had the impression (from the trailers, reviews and nc-17 rating) it would be."
3,B-Movie paradise with some incredibly fake-looking dinos!,"Let's face it -- even for the time, these effects were bad (compare to ""Kong"", made nearly two decades earlier). Still, it's a fun movie that, if you saw as a youth, will make you feel nostalgic. The kids will probably dig it too. The typical ""King Kong""/""Lost World"" type story. Most of the characters are unlikeable, including the female lead. Fairbanks is the only character you care about. In any case, it is a fun ride and if you aren't the type who will spend the entire time nit-picking, you'll enjoy it. Otherwise, stay away -- just the effects alone will make you die of laughter (though the sloth creature is decent). The slowest, most stiff-looking rubber T-Rexes I've ever seen."
2,Frivolous fun,"My wife enjoyed this movie but thought the ""men in suits"" creatures where ridiculous and probable is one she won't watch again."
4,Fats Domino - Greatest Hits,"It had great songs. There was just one other hit I had hoped it would have, but didn't.Sound quality was good."
3,Not sure,"I received these from VitaCost in a horribly mangled package with half the tablets crumbled. However, VitaCost was nice enough to immediately replace my order. So for them, I give this 3 stars. Excellent company with fast shipping. That being said, these tablets taste AWFUL. I am not a picky eater, but the fake sugar taste of these tablets is so strong and leaves an after taste that won't go away. Only purchase if you have a strong stomach and don't mind the taste of fake sugar."
4,Awesome 1991 alt-pop.,"I don't know much about their other records, but this one I've heard hundreds of times. Hooks, harmonizing, happy melodies, it's all on the ""Real Ramona"". Between the good opener ""Counting Backwards"", and the excellent closer ""Two Step"", are the great tracks ""Graffiti"", ""Hook In Her Head"", and ""Honeychain"". All amazing songs. But my favorite is easily ""Not Too Soon"". That's just such an aggressively rockin', yet beautiful song. I always turn it up for that one. Overall, this has got to be at least one of their best albums, and will go great with your ""Veruca Salt"" and ""Breeders"" cd's."
4,share this with your friends,"if you love this band--and you want to convert your friends to fans, too, then this is the album to get the job done. track #1 ""counting backwards"" is the reason i bought this album after i heard it on one of the now-defunct-but-quite-legendary local radio stations. this is a good album for those long road trips where you're with someone and you need to find music you can both agree on. this'll do it. for the record, i also love track #8, ""hook in her head"". a kick-butt tune that stars out one way and takes a drastic, yet appropriate turn. the music is distorted, yet precise. the band blends together to make a unique sound. the musicians are good, the lyrics un-annoyingly stick to you, and kristen can definitely sing! need i say more?"
4,"Hoffman is great, Interesting Commentary on indian massacre",Hoffman gives a touching look at the integration of one white man into an indian tribe and the non integration of the indian culture with that of the land hungry white christian mob from Europe. As told from one man's perspective we see and feel the heart of the indian people.
4,Long before Forest Gump,"It took me almost fifteen minutes to conclude that the movie was indeed a comedy, because i had a strong impression about this movie being a hard drama. The comedy of this movie is actually very dark where the killings and sufferings of native americans has been displayed with humor.Then after half an hour of wathcing I figured out that ""Little Big Man"" was the original concept of ""Forest Gump"" where a guy narrates his very very rich life that goes all over the contemporary western world. Is this movie funny? I found it ""just right"" funny considering the sesitivity of the subject of this movie and being original too. It was fun watching Dustin Hoffman and the camera follows him through out the movie. In the movie sometimes he speaks in southern accent and sometimes in his original italian accent. Was that meant to be like that? Since this movie being a comedy you can consider that, i guess; and even the cheesy makeup of 120 years old Jack."
4,Wonderful show,"This edition, see picture on front of cover, was made in Mexico. I loved is movie, but this Is a shortened version"
5,A Multi-faceted Treat,"Dustin Hoffman turns in his arguably best performance as Jack Crabb, the 121-year-old nursing-home resident being interviewed by a young, serious journalist in 1970. Hoffman's portrayal of the ancient Crabb is very well done (the 1970-era makeup is actually quite believable), with voice pitch and body language that reminded this viewer of his own aged relatives.But it is Hoffman's portrayal of young Jack Crabb as he segues between the ""human beings"" (Cheyenne nation) and the white world (gunslinger, snake-oil salesman, innocent boy getting ogled by Faye Dunaway) that gives this feature its shine. Hoffman easily slips into each role, displaying his versatility again and again as he protests his alliance to save his skin.""God bless George Washington!""This feature cries out for a special edition DVD with large amounts of supplements. We can only hope that the studio pays the proper amount of attention when they make the transfer."
1,"Over a month, not yet delivered!","It has been over a month and has yet to be delivered.It gas been paid for, including lack-of-shipping, and mis-handling"
1,Not viewable,"This video did not meet the USA requirements for viewing in this country. It was made to be viewed in places like Germany. Therefore, it was a waste of our money. Why is someone selling nonviewable items on the US market? It should have been stated as such."
5,Must Be On Top Ten Westerns,"All the others on this page have done a wonderful job of reviewing this movie, so I will not continue. However I think it is a shame that it is not on any Top Ten lists of westerns. All the lists I have seen are heavy with Ford directed movies depicting the Indians as the bad, the yellow scarved cavalrymen as the good, and the obligatory love interest of some chick riding into indian country on the stage. I suppose it is understandable given the times these were made, etc., but most westerns are a notch below Little Big Man. Outlaw Josie Wales should be in the top ten also, but that rant is for another page."
5,"Number one favorite movie, ever!",This remarkable film touches so many historical notes with such perfect tone that it deserves to be rated among the greatest movies ever produced.It is a joy to watch--spoken by one who has watched it many times.
4,wonderful,It is just one of those iconic movies. You should see it. Dustin Hoffman is very good. The story itself is wonderfully told. I was totally entertained.
5,"Cowabunga, it's a hit!","I got this for my almost 6 year old and he loves it. With 3 levels of play, he hasn't been bored yet (nor have I). Most of these liscensed games are pretty lame, but this one is different each time you play and he loves the ""battles"". It even teaches a little bit about strategy, math and teamwork! Now that can't be bad. It is durable enough that my 2 year old can help play (she rolls the dice for the bad guys). And at just under $6, it is an excellent birthday gift for the turtle lover on your list!!"
3,nice quality but smaller than expected,"the turqouise has nice color, but the chips are truly chips....and much smaller than I had expected. I actually ended up using this as a gift as it wasn't what I had expected or was looking for. Good choice if looking for a delicate turquoise piece."
1,Total Lunacy!,"I was forced to listen this drivel at a party, and if I hadn't gone with a friend, I would have escaped. Instead, my ears were assaulted by this non-stop barrage of foul mouthed antics. I only gave it 1 star for the cover art (I MUST meet this woman!) and while that's extremely shallow, it's the only redeeming quality of this release. My advice: buy it, throw away the CD itself and enjoy the cover photo!"
4,"Thoroughly enjoyable, shades of ""Lomesome Dove""","I struggled initially with the author's style. But after a few pages, I was so caught up in the story that the writing style was no longer noticeable and came to realize that it was an important contribution to the tone of the book. It was a great adventure that caused me to put aside my current Tom Clancy and spend the weekend with ""All The Pretty Horses."" It was good enough that I have ordered the second and third books in this triology."
1,It could have been better,"Im sorry but I cant like this book, it is full of unending sentences, bad grammar and a society domanated by men, where women rareley have name and are only used for the plesure of men. The book is unrealistic and writen like it is a common for an seventeen year old to self cauterize a bullet wound with a burning hot gun barrel. I give MaCarthy credit for trying to make a poetic book but I just dont feel that you can romantasize throwing up, or use the word ""blood"" so many times. Although I do admit that the book did have many thought provoking conversations between Rawlins and John Grady Cole."
1,A highly agrivating pile of schlock,"Frustrated authors take note, you can be published and you don't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation, sentence clarity, story, structure or grammar. Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with ""All the Pretty Horses."" Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought ""What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it. I'm sure people will buy it, after all Americans don't care about grammar anyway.""I'm not going to dive into the plot of the story- you can read it above. This book falls short of one of the best in literature. How they compare this guy to Faulkner is beyond me, the comparrison is an insult to Faulkner and people who read books in general. Most fifth graders can write better, more enthralling naratives."
4,A Western Epic,"I will not be able to add much at all to the hundreds more articulate reviews. Nevertheless, I will write this novel is refreshing, beautifully written, and leads the reader down many intriguing paths. I hastily look forward to enjoying the two remaining Border trilogy installments."
3,"Ok, but if you have a choice, don't read it",This book was pretty boring from the start. It's about John Grady Cole a teenager who left home to go to Mexico. On the way he has many adventures and trials. Him and Rawlins leave and ride across the border. On the way they pick up a skinny little guy named Blevins. He has a real nice horse and gun. In a freak storm he loses his horse and his gun. In Mexico they are hired to break horses at a hacienda. Grady falls in love for the owner's young daughter. Which in turn leads to an arrest and a sentence to a Mexical jail. He murders a man that is trying to kill him in jail and ends up getting out of jail. After he gets his horse back from a Mexican ranger. At the end of the story he goes home and meets up with Rawlins and says hello. Then he just drifted away. This book is great for anyone who likes boring reading that takes a long time to get to the good stuff.
2,Faulkner it Ain't,"What it is is a pretty good novelization of George Miller's great movie The Man from Snowy River (based on a poem by Banjo Paterson). McCarthy hasn't WF's metaphysics, these are replaced by truly brilliant descriptions of the southerwestern landscape that you need a Baedecker's to decipher. He's good at describing Marlboro Men doing Marlboro Men type things, but couldn't write a decent woman character if it meant five miles of downed fenceline. That McCarthy is so popular is less a reflection of his brilliance than the dearth of good literature out there. Then again, better read him than say, Colin Harrison. Or read Blood Meridian -- a truly brilliant work of genius., nothing like it in American Lit."
1,MUCHO--MUCHO----SPANISH,"THAT TITLE GIVES AWAY THIS REVIEW---WAY--WAY--TOO MUCH SPANISH---WITH LITTLE OR NO ENGLISH TRANSLATION. I TRIED TO TAKE THE TIMETO CROSS-TO ENGLISH SOME OF IT---BUT---WAY TOO MUCH. ON TOP OF THAT--I THOUGHT THE STORY WAS PRETTY GOOD---BUT---IT GOT MESSED UP WHEN THEAUTHOR STARTED PUTING IT INTO WORDS. RUN-ON AFTER RUN-ON AFTER RUN-ON,AND, THERE WERE PARTS OF THE BOOK THAT---?? WHY IS THIS IN HERE ??"
2,No Habla Espanol!!!,"I found I had a hard time reading this book. Yes, while it's true the ""cinematography"" is great, if you don't speak Spanish you miss out on alot of dialogue! I have the other 2 books in the trilogy and I'm not even sure I'll read them. There are much better books out there if you have limited time for reading."
4,Wiser1,"This book was wonderful! I finished it in one day. It kept my interest from stsrt to finish. Not only did it deal with a very serious subject, but the story was presented in a way to hold the reader's interest. I admire this family for their healing and accomplishments in helping other addicts and families of addicts. Having a son who is an alcoholic, this book really was special to me."
5,WOW.,"This book is truly inspiring and has helped me look at my family's addiction in such a different light.Thank you both so much for sharing your stories, it has absolutely changed my life."
5,It takes courage,"Our daughter was falling into the world of addiction, and a good friend of mine bought this book for us. The timing was perfect as we were in the early stages of trying to figure out what to do for our daughter. It turns out that reading this book was the first thing we did, and it was the foundation of all of our actions. It gave us the understanding and courage to do what was necessary to help our daughter, and she is well on the path to recovery. It is a must read for anyone who has a loved one living with the disease of addiction, and I recommend it for every parent who truly loves their children as it may very well give them the knowledge to help their child someday. As we found out, addiction has no boundaries, it can aflict anyone. Absolutely the most important book I have ever read. It saved our daughter's life."
5,This book has impacted my life in so many ways!,"I truely could not put this book down. It is written with such truth and paints a poetic piture of the tragedys and triumps involved in addiction. It has helped me to understand, accept and pull through this illness that has also plagued my family. I have purchased many copies since reading it for friends and family because it is so powerful and healing."
1,mediocre city,"This album is so terrible, it does not deserve the Sugar name. If you are thinking of this as your first Sugar album, I'd strongly recommend Copper Blue, and Beaster over this one. Every song sounds the same, it is poorly produced, and it is a frustratingly uninspired effort."
4,A great CD at a bargain price,"I bought this CD many moons ago at full price and have always felt it worthwhile. At this bargain price it's an absolute must have. Just listen to track 1 ""Gift"" - if your pulse isn't racing after the first go round, then you must be dead! Admittedly, the entire CD doesn't hold up to this incredible opening, but it's not for lack of trying, and it does come frickin' close in a few places. Some kind of masterwork, FU:EL is one artifact of the grunge era which still holds up."
4,Love this product,"Our 19 month old son still loves to play with his symphony mirror. When he isn't quite ready to sleep, or wakes up early, he spins the dial (with his hands and feet), listens to the music and watches the lights.An improvement we wish for is the ability to change the tune with every spin of the dial (It completes each tune before you can start the next)."
4,finally i can get more sleep,"I love this toy. It allows me to get more sleep and amuses my daughter at the same time. She has this toy since she was 2 months old and she is 7 months old right now. She wakes up and plays with it during the night and when she wakes up in the morning, she doesnt wake up crying anymore because the mirror and music amuses her. The only bad thing about it is that she kicks it in her sleep sometimes, but it doesnt wake her up, that can be solved with the off switch which is a must have on all baby toys :)"
5,My grandson loves this toy & so do I!,The music is softer than most such toys and it is easy for a young baby (5 months) to activate.
4,Mirror,"When I first got the mirror she didnt pay it much mind. She just gotten home from the hospital and all she cared about was eating, and sleeping. But now at 5 wks she loves the music and lights. About a week I was showing her how to spin the wheel and her eyes lighted up.Only a few days ago, I witnessed her hit the wheel at the bottom and start the music herself! How fast they grow up. I recommend this toy for all new parents, my advice though is to make sure it is low enough in the crib so they can touch the bar.And Get the Mommy Bear, the teddy bear that makes the womb noise..it works wonders!!"
3,"Great for the very little, but turn off the Music!!!!","My son loved turning the rattle bar and looking at himself in the mirror but I made the mistake of turning on the long play music and it is way too sensitive to movement! My son would shift in his crib and the durn'd thing would go off again! Luckily it didn't wake him up but it kept all the adults up by starting over every few seconds! I began to dread the little introductory sound that I had thought was cute when I first got it. Oh no it's started over, again!The music switch is inconveniently located in the center of the back of the toy and is quite well blocked by the rails of a standard crib. This means you have to risk waking the little one up by rattling around in the nursery to turn it off."
1,REMASTERING HELL! AVOID!,"These great performaces are ruined by a horrible 'remastering' job.This is digital hell, robs every ounce of music, it's like every nore is disconnected from each other!Horrible job.Get the 'cheapo' reissue. The music breathes on that one unlike this garbage!"
1,Dismally dated,"1 1/2Poorly rendered goth-prog deserves to keep its sleeves in the dust of obscurity, but may hold sway for ambitious rock-organ gloomers, nostalgia grinders, and freak seekers for a few interesting instrumental interludes between convoluted choruses of darkened dreck."
3,A decent book but not for everyone,"I have had this book for a number of years and just got around to reading it. It's a good read as long as you know why you are buying it. Huitema's book is more of an academic book, he gives a very good history of why protocols where developed in the way they were and obviously knows his subject extremely well. It is not for someone who is new to Routing and wants to learn the protocols, as he assumes a certain level of knowledge. He reminds me of my professor at college, if you went into knowing nothing you would just come out confused. For someone at the CCNA/CCNP level wanting practical advice with a Cisco slant, without having to read the Cisco course books (which really only teach you how to pass the exam) I would recommend James Macfarlane's book over this. For someone who is a competent Network Engineer wanting to learn why routing protocols behave the way they do, I would recommend this book."
1,This sign never stuck on the glass over 20 minutes!!!!,"When I use it on my car, it never stuck on the car over 20 minutes. I bought it since I read the amazon review that looks not bad. But when I used it, I realized it is a poor product."
2,The supposed game,This was really not what I wanted. All I wanted was the game on the computer to play during idle moments. Whatever this was it was not the simple game that is on my phone.
2,WAY TO EASY AND UNFUN,"This is the easiest game ever, me and my friend beat the whole game in 45 minutes. It is fun the first time you play and then you just lose interest. I recommend renting before buying."
5,The Wife Love's It,"I fitted this to a mountain bike. Took some jimmy-ing, but it worked out. I think it's actually made for a regular bike, but whatever the case, my wife loves it and sometimes even buys groceries (when it's a few) and brings them home in her basket or we'll go on picnics with the picnic basket in the bike basket. Great buy for the romantic in all of us."
4,Good Starter Camera!,"This is the first digital camera I have really gotten to use. I think its great! It may be a bit heavier than other digital cameras, but it takes a good amount of pictures, and a good quality. I reccomend this camera."
5,Good product,"No complaints, outstanding pictures.Get yourself a 64mb memory card [price]will give you 256 picture capacity.Also get rechargable Ni-MH batteries and charger (any brand). Otherwise you will be buying lots of batteries."
2,Marginal performance and sound quality.,"These are literally [with a Wollensak tape recorder] home recordings. The sound quality is very poor, and amateurish voice-over announcements are irritating and distracting. Gid Tanner is the only member of the original Skillet Lickers on the album and his performance, never very good anyway, is very poor. The other performers are Gid's son, grandson, and local performers. The material is about the only good thing about the album ... all but, as I recall, three selections are genuine ""old-time"" music. If you are desperate for this kind of music, you might try this album. However, you can find much, much better stuff elsewhere."
3,"In Good Voice, unfortunate accompaniment","Unfortunately, Jack made a bad choice to have mostly electronic keyboard accompaniment on this album, except possibly for ""here's that rainy day"". Not even a real electric guitar or bass is anywhere to be found. The drums also sound computerized. How sad. 3 stars for the vocals (4 stars if you can ignore the excessive reverb), a big ""ZERO"" for the fake sounding accomp."
4,Does what its supposed to,These staples work as expected. Monel is the only metal that can stand up to repeated salt water exposure. I used these to tack down carpet covers for bunks on my boat trailer. They hold up well to the elements and fasten strongly. Only 4 stars as they are rather pricey. Monel is expensive to manufacture however. Very satisfied.
4,Read and Sing along,"My two-year-old daughter likes it a lot. When we first got it, I sang it for her. Later, I would stop singing after ""Mommy calls the doctor and the doctor says"". Then, my daughter would finish it by singing ""No more monkeys jumping on the bed"" in the tone that the annoyed doctor would have done. And we all laugh together."
5,Same old song but with clever illustrations,"Well done. You'll enjoy singing, counting and adlibing about the doctor's reaction to momma calling on the doctor. Fun."
5,Ten Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed,"My grandson would sing the song ""Ten Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed"" so he was delighted to receive the book."
4,Lots of fun!,"This book is now a favorite of my grand daughter, age 13 months! We have lots of fun reading it, in a sing-song voice, and she loves pointing at the monkeys as they fall off the bed!"
5,Ambient Noise 101,"Well now..not to sound too hyperbolic but...This is without a doubt my fave cd...no doubt that it's very much influenced by the Cocteau Twins and perhaps My Bloody Valentine (of which ""loveless"" would probably be my second fave cd) but Gala just has such a warmth and soaring feel to it that some of the other ""shoegazer"" bands could not duplicate. From ""delux"" to ""thoughtforms"" Miki and Emma's vocals and wall of sound created such a lovely, beautiful moment in music...."
4,Just love these tapes,Love theses for taping base and ceiling moldings when we paint. Do not cause sticky residue when removed. One inch works plenty enough as I finish the edges with a 1.5 inch purse brush.
3,Not one of the best painters tapes you can buy,"This tape doesn't stick well to all surfaces and allows paint to ""bleed"" under. I was under-impressed. For good, quality effect I would recommend a better quality tape. This product caused me to perform a lot of redo and touchup work."
5,jimi meets george harrison in an indian summers dream,"if you like jimi hendrix,the beatles,funkadelic andyou know the mothership belongs on mr. gilmo's propertyyou'll love this disc.came out in the early 90's w/ someother black rock bands who were kickin'butt & gettin'ignored. every song is hot!john lennon &jimi; hendrixwould be proud."
4,My freshman year at college,My roomate found this cd at the dollar store. It blew us away when he spun it. Every song was good. I would highly recommend this album to anyone who was starting college in the early 90's or wants to hear something original instead of the corporate MTV band clones out today.
3,A Great Piece of History,"From the literary side, this work is a little rough around the edges. From the historical side, I am glad to finally find some firsthand information about the 8076 MASH. I wish there were more stories about the MASH units and the contributions they made during the forgotten war. My dad was in the 8076, after Dr. Apel served there, but unfortunately he never talked about his time in the Korea. This book helped fill that gap and will always remain in my library."
1,This movie is a clunker,Wasted talent. None of the characters are believable in the roles they are portraying. Some funny stuff. Craig Ferguson can do better. Charlotte Church should stick to singing as acting is not her forte. Every thing in this movie seems forced and there is no chemistry between the characters.
1,Oh well,I was going to check out CF other work aside from the late night show.Unfortunately this movie does not satisfy me at all.From camera work through the entire story is like heavy honey pouring down from the jar.Anyway check it out for your self and may be you will like it.
5,"Nausea, in a good way","Brigge seems to be journaling through some rage here. But a good kind of rage, the kind that somehow weaves childhood memories together with weird historical anecdotes with existential subtexts. There's some hefty reference to traditional French and German poets, and a few of the more famous nuns out there, but I think I was happiest when he kept it personal and wrote about his walks around Paris. Some might disagree with me, but I really think this book is about dogs. Rilke's dogs don't trouble themselves with the notion of fate or how to meet death. They just are."
4,Some Great Songs,"This band broke up a few years back. I think they were Georgetown University graduates. They played in a bunch of bars in DC and then spread out traveling around. They produced three really quality songs ""Katie's a No Show."" ""Disappointing Mary,"" and ""Back on Earth.""If you like Sister Hazel, Dave Matthews, Matchbox Twenty, and this genre of music, you will enjoy the ""Back on Earth"" CD."
5,Do yourself a selfish favor and get this book.,"The Selfish Gene manages to be one of the most fascinating and readable yet informative science books I have ever read. It a book about the evolution of life, and life itself, from a gene's eye view. It explains some of the tougher questions we have about evolution and covers many subjects such as: the origin of life, game theory, and memes. For many people who aren't very familiar with evolutionary theory, this book will absolutely change the way you see the world. If you are already familiar with some of what Dawkins is talking about you will definitely be in for a treat.The book is the perfect length and covers just the right amount of material and yet feels like its not leaving out too much either.For budding scientists with an interest in biology, or ANYONE who is just curious about the natural world and mankind's place in it this is a must read."
1,Riddled with Mistakes,"This book is so full of mistakes, it baffles me how it ever made it to print. There are 81 pages of corrections that you will want to get from the author if you buy this book."
3,pretty ring with wrong stone color,"I purchased this ring to go with my very pretty blue topaz earrings. The ring looks very nice, but the stone color is not like any of my blue topaz jewelry, more like a VERY light aquamarine, almost white! I am going to keep it anyway because it is a lovely ring and the price was right, but the picture is a misrepresentation, therefore only 3 stars."
2,Picture is not a good depiction,"The color of the ring was not as pictured, hint of the palest blue. The sizing is a bit smaller than anticipated and it seems that the stone side is more flat instead of round. It probably would have been more flattering to have 5 stones and a more circular appearance.It still stacks and is not that bad for the price"
1,Disappointed,I ordered the Blue Topaz 7-Stone Ring. I got a cubic zirconia type stone...It was NOT blue. I don't like the white stone and didn't order it.
1,Junk!,Junk didn't work! Dimmed my lights and got really hot. My lights never flashed! Would not suggest to a friend.
4,Chapter missing?,"The Part II of the book is named Abdominal,pelvic and thoracic sonography, but there is no thorax chapter in the book! The older edition has the thorax chapter, i wonder what happened... Is my copy missing it? I cant believe the authors cut it off!"
2,Disappointing,"There were some great shots, not doubt, but it was just a remake or reedited version of Planet Earth! I loved James Earl Jones voice for sure but most of the scenes were kind of depressing and violent. I wish I could get my money back but I'll just sell it or give it away."
5,Thanks,Sorry it took so long to review. DIdnt know I needed to. It was wonderful and my students love it.
5,EXCELENTE PRODUCCION,"Es una excelente produccion, y aunque es un resumen de algunas de las tomas realizadas para ""Planeta Tierra"" , vale la pena volverlo a ver y que se haya hecho el esfuerzo por llegar a mas personas a traves de las salas de cine, para tratar de crear conciencia de las maravillas de nuestro planeta que estamos echando a perder por la falta de control y de respeto por la naturaleza y todos los seres que nos acompañan en este fragil planeta"
1,Award for: Most Depressing Film,"This movie is extremely slow, and very sad. I will not show this film to my children. I understand the circle of life, but I thought this movie was going to document life, not death. I don't feel that the circle of life is something that needs to be documented and seen, we all know it exists and how it works. In this film, there is a wolf that captures a baby caribou, then there is an attack on a baby elephant by a herd of lions, then a leopard eating another small fragile animal. Can't tell you what else this movie entails, this was all in the first 20 minutes and after that I quit watching. It is NOT a good film. I did not buy this movie to see a bunch of animals get hunted by predators and ate. I would not recommend this for adults and DEFINITELY NOT FOR CHILDREN."
2,Beware - 98% of scenes are from Planet Earth Series,"If you dont already have Planet Earth, and you want an abreviated version of it, and you prefer the voice of James Earl Jones over the lady in Planet Earth (which I preferred), then this might be the thing for you.But if you're like me and already own the blu-ray set of Planet Earth, then you'll feel like a sucker after watching 2 min of this movie. You wouldn't feel like a sucker if Disney had clearly displayed on the cover, ""Contains Repackaged Planet Earth Footage"" but since Disney doesnt mention this, you will feel like a sucker.I think I saw a couple new scenes, which led me to say Earth is 98% equal to Planet Earth footage. The voice over is better in Planet Earth as well, and they dont cut from scene to scene as much."
3,"Best Seen, Not Heard.","Best viewed with the mute button activated.The narration is less than informative, and the soundtrack is inappropriate as to what is happening, and where it is happening. Middle Eastern music accompanying a polar bear's final moments? King Ptolemy II kept a polar bear...but this is a bit of a stretch.The story-lines are distractingly disjointed, incomplete, and constantly interrupted by gorgeous cinematography. Better to give us just the cinematography.The agenda the producer's were pushing in this film is never veiled..."
2,Good Idea but.....,"The concept that the manufacturer cam up with here is a great one. I mean, cat grass right there with the water, nice simple and space saving right? The problem is that the grass does not seem to grow very well, the roots plug the intake of the fountain and if the water level gets even slightly low the grass seeds end up being out of the water and will not sprout and grow properly. Again great idea but needs some help in the functionality arena."
2,Cat Grass,"This product is everything it claims to be. In a few days you get healthy, beautiful green grass. The only problem is my cat will not eat the grass.Does anyone know of another kind of grass I can grow in my fountain?"
2,Cheapskates...,"My cat likes to eat grass so when I bought the Drinkwell Platinum I figured what the hey. Come to find put, the clips that are required to use the seed pods are NOT INCLUDED. We'll see how it goes when I get around to finding the proper attachments."
2,poor,this was right for the price but after sometime the roots clogged the fountain and my cats stopped eatting the grass
5,Pet Treat,This is a nice product; I have 5 cats so it was put to the test. A great way for indoor cats to get their greens.
1,Why should delivery take 2 months?,"I ordered this and several other items around the first of february and received all but this in a timely manner. When I finally went to check on it on feb. 20th the estimated delivery date was changed to late march to the middle of may. This item is not anything important to me but what in the world could possibly cause such a long delay? If you need an item like this quickly, I would suggest seeing your local music store before buying here."
1,color,"So my daughter wanted a pink guitar but I was not able to find one locally in time. Now she says she wants a pink gig bag. Funny, even Daisy Rock doesn't have a pink short scale accoustic gig bag. Does anyone know where to find this item?"
4,fantastic conclusion!,"The third entry into the dark angel trilogy wraps the story up beautifully. There are twists and turns that even I couldn't see coming and it is wonderful seeing Aeriel come into her own. This story is about being greater than you thought you could be. Its about sacrifice and duty. It might make you cry. Nevertheless, its a wonderful ending. Not perfect, not too sad - just right."
4,Finally back in print but still a DISAPPOINTMENT!,"All I have to say is that I love this series, but this is my least favorite of the 3. The first time I read it I actually screamed ""How can she do this to Aeriel, how can she do this to ME!"" I was with Aeriel all throughout her journey, through every struggle, every pain, every heartbreak...how is it that she could finally win for her world & have that happen, IT'S NOT FAIR.But then again, that is life, right? Just because it is another world, another time, another person...life still is not fair.I may have read these books a millions times, I may be 26 years old now, instead of 12, but I am still very angry with Meredith Ann Pierce. I read the last book hoping that this time she'll get it right...sigh. Read it anyway or you will always wonder what happened."
4,Finally,"It always seemed as if Aeriel was being prepared for a much greater task than any previous one. Even though she does not get her heart's desire, she proves herself worthy of a far greater reward. She also wins the love of Irrylath, even though she does not get be with him, which is a victory in itself. The whole trilogy is a journey of love and its growth as Aeriel grows into womanhood."
1,I was Very Dissapointed,"I expected so much more, I mean, after the first book The Darkangel, I just had to read the sequels. Thing is, I wish I never did start. Okay, so she gets married, it seemed as though nothing happened at all emotionally."
3,Shockingly funny,"My wife watched this movie while I was out of town. She said she laughed out loud, even brought to tears, several times. So I gave it a try. I must say, I went into the movie wanting a lot; considering the review my wife gave it. I was pleasantly surprised by the storyline and humor. In particular, Melissa McCarthy, who's listed very low on the casting, steals the show. Her humor, delivery, and presence makes this movie work. Weeks after watching it, we talk most about the funny scenes where Melissa was the star of the show. I coined this one; the female version of The Hangover."
3,Not as funny as it should have been,"I think my expectations were set too high since I was told it was ""like The Hangover"" - they are similar in some respects but Bridesmaids lacks the clever plotting, carefully planned payoffs and inherent likability of the broken characters.Bridesmaids has a couple of extremely funny scenes linked together by a very predictable story but it never really delivers on the promise of the premise. Kristin Wiig's character is a mashup of the SNL roles she's played in the last season and comes across as annoying and unbearable. Maya Rudolph snoozes her way through the film and doesn't really have any funny scenes to play to. The Unrated edition has some over-the-top dialog that doesn't really add anything to the film.Still, in a year of pretty bad films, it's not a terrible film - just not a particularly good one."
5,great quality,It can be risky ordering a movie from Amazon sometimes and this seller gave great quality and shipped it fast! Very satisfied!
1,This Movie Sucks (Overrated and not funny),"First of all, this movie is not funny! A bunch of bridemaids completing for the one spot. This movie is no where near the hangover either. If you are an old person, it might be funny. THIS MOVIE SUCKS, PERIOD! I wouldn't rent this movie, waste of money!"
1,Not funny,"This movie was not funny, and not at all what I expected. It was less about Bridesmaids and more about the main character's depressing life."
1,This is not a comedy. It must be an intervention...,"I thought this would be a funny movie with some female antics of a group of..wait for it, bridesmaids. Its not. Also hyped as a female version of the Hangover--its not even close. First all of--Hangover actually had some humor in it. For bridesmaids, I think virtually all the jokes were in the trailers. The remainder is about 1 hour and 55 minutes of torture/gross out humor. Its not a freaks and geeks vibe, despite being directed by Paul Feig.I have no idea why it was such a big hit. I am at a complete loss. I suppose seeing people have food poisoning all over themselves is not my idea of comedy. If that is appealing for you, then go for it.minor spoilersAs I said, Melissa McCarthy was great but too small of a role. Wendi McLendon-Covey was hilarious and probably was on screen for less than 10 minutes. Weird film, not as advertised, and pray for no sequel. I hope Paul Feig can direct other movies and redeem himself for this horror."
1,I don't understand why people liked this movie,"I simply don't understand why people liked this movie. There were a couple of chuckles, but the plot was boring and slow and I found the three main characters (particularly Kristen Wiig) to be very unlikeable. I would have liked to see more scenes with the supporting bridesmaids (who were actually responsible for the few laugh-worthy scenes)."
2,Not what I expected.,"I couldn't wait for this to come On Demand. I had heard it was a better than the Hangover (which I didn't think was all that funny in the first place). So to hear that it was BETTER, I had to give it a chance.OMG...from the opening scene, I was like....Here we go. I decided to have a mental checklist of what disguisting things they would do in hopes to make a joke. 1. Fart Jokes 2. Butt Jokes 3. Disgusting Sex Jokes, etc...etc.Everytime they did one, I checked it off.I didn't actually laugh until the Rudolph character falls in the street in her wedding dress....That is halfway through the movie. Also, the ending was sooooo dumb.The only character I actually liked was the Cop.If you liked the Hangover, give it a try. If you are like me - in the minority. Don't even bother."
5,Hilarious,This film is laugh out loud funny. Kristen Wiig and the rest of the cast do great in their roles. I would definitely recommend it if you want a good laugh.
4,not polite but it is funny,"OK, it's not polite but it is funny.I'm glad I watched this at home because I was LITERALLY rolling on the floor laughing thru most of the movie, including some of the gross bits. The sight of me, a white haired old lady, acting so inappropriately tickled by such things would have likely been off-putting to a normal film viewing audience."
5,Hilarious,"It was pure genius. My best friend and I have never cried so hard in a theater, we were laughing so hard. Don't be confused by the title, it is NOT a chick flick."
1,Dumb movie!,"I'd been hearing about this movie, had seen a few film clips before, and was curious. I enjoy the talents of Maya Rudolph, a very talented actress. Unfortunately, she wasn't the only one in the movie. In retrospect, I wish I hadn't wasted the TV's time, but I had to know why this movie had been so well received by the viewing public. I still don't know. It was without a doubt a very STUPID movie. Perhaps, one of the DUMBEST I've seen in a long time. I think it was far from entertaining, unless you're brain dead. The lesson learned was that sometimes if you act like an idiot, are hurtful, immature, and are selfish . . . sometimes things work out for you. Hey, it's a movie, what can I tell you?"
1,Funny? Not in my book,"I tried watching this, but I ended up turning it off after about halfway through. I found very little that struck me as humorous. Maybe the really good parts were still coming, but I was so bored with the storyline that I couldn't take it anymore."
1,Dreadful and Unfunny,"I love all kinds of movies. I rarely meet a movie I don't find something I enjoy about it. Not Bridesmaids. The characters are completely unlikeable, most especially the main character. Comic moments are very few and very far between, to the point of being almost non-existent. Segments that aren't at all funny to begin with drag on and on to the point of complete embarrassment. Too many segments of this film are actually painful to watch. In the real world, when the main character gets tossed off the plane, she would end up in prison, and rightfully so. Most of her shenanigans are so mean-spirited and awful that one cannot understand how her best friend, or her potential new boyfriend, could forgive her. Ever."
1,Do I have to give this thing a star??,I was thinking that there weren't enough truly raunchy films for women and then this gem came along. Problem solved. Not funny at all. I can't think of a single redeeming quality. I saw this in the theater and would have walked out if I hadn't been with so many friends. I still regret not leaving.
4,Outrageous and very very funny,I can't remember laughing this hard during a movie in years. You will love the dialogue and crazy situations that the characters are in. Kristen Wiig is a gifted comic and carries the entire movie. Don't miss this one.
5,Excellent movie!,One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The type of movie you can watch over and over again. And standard shipping was extremely fast!
1,not funny,"This movie is not funny. It's actually a little depressing. Anyone who says its just like The Hangover, but with girls, is wrong. Save your money. Netflix streaming should have it soon."
1,A chick Flick made for men's humor - AWFUL don't waste your money,"I read reviews, I heard people rave about this show, and if you like juvenile humor, typical stuff that make men laugh and snort, than this movie is for you, but if you expected to see a movie that was quality with a truly funny plot, this movie is NOT the one. I love Melissa McCarthy and she played such a horrible part that I can't even enjoy Mike and Molly anymore, I keep seeing that disgusting woman from this show. If I could give 1/2 star I would."
5,BEST. GIRL. COMEDY. EVURRRR,"It's like Sarah Silverman but more outrageous and somehow less offensive :OThat being said, believe it or not, this movie is not as funny once you have watched it 2398344.6 times.But still, those first 2398342 times go by very quickly.If this movie didn't make you laugh, you need to visit a psychiatrist and start treatment right away."
5,So funny!,FANTASTIC! This was super funny. It was a great comedy! I highly recommend this movie. It's just great and hilarious!
5,AMAZING!,"If I could give this 10 stars I would, to me this was the funniest movie I've seen since The Hangover, I laughed until I cried. I can't wait for this to come out, so that I can laugh some more and in my home. I love a funny movie and I have told any and everyone about this a highly recommend it! Love this movie!@"
2,"Delivers what it promises, but nothing more","We bought this movie because we'd heard so many reviews saying it was a great comedy. Sadly, it's just a mediocre lowbrow comedy (which is fine if you know what you're getting). A few bright spots (the reconciliation cake; the TSA schtick), but most of the jokes were boringly predictable; the plot was poorly integrated and ultimately pointless. It's basically a 10 minute comedy routine padded out to movie length."
5,Great!,Movie is great! Worked well with no problems at all ! Shipped very fast also! I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good laugh
2,Dont Do it,"If you are a guy, dont let your girl talk you into this one.She said ""it has funny parts"" but dont get suckered in.It might be a good movie for girls but it is brutal for most guys to sit through if they are anything like me."
2,Not that great,I purchased this movie based on previews seen on TV. The movie looked like it would be very funny. Have to say not as funny as preview leads you to believe & just so predictable.
1,If you like potty humor...,"If you like potty humor, bad acting and a script that sounds like it could have been written by a pubescent 12 year old, this movie is for you. We gave this half an hour and through the sex, bathroom humor (that wasn't even funny) and bad acting we could find no reason to waste any more time. Painfully bad."
1,Brides Maids,This is the Worst film of 2011. Why anybody would enjoy watching women defecating and vomiting is beside me. Save your money and time...both are too short to waste on this film!
1,Worst Movie ever,"This is the worst movie I have ever watched. I sat through the whole thing, for some strange reason, thinking the the humor would be just around the corner. Never happened, the whining only continued to get worse. For those who found humor in this, please tell me what part I missed!!I cannot believe this is what humor has become (please take me back to the past). I should have known that this was a real loser given that it was from the producer of Superbad, Knocked up and the 40 year old virgin. I thought about sending this back, but I was afraid someone else might end up with it.I would have given this no stars if it was available."
3,It made me laugh.,"Usually I don't go for movies like this... the physical comedies with bathroom humor... but I liked this move. Yes, there are unbelievable moments and the movie would have been a lot better with a tighter script and better actors. Nonetheless, I will still give it 3 stars for effort and because it made me laugh."
4,Great chick flick and not a bad date movie either,Watched it with my husband and he didn't love it at first but came around. Definitely a good chick flick with close friends and similar senses of humor.
2,Very Over Rated.,"Sure, it has one or two funny spots, but it also has a weak story line, and LOTS of bad manners. For what it cost to purchase this disc -- I would not have bought it had I known what it was really like."
1,Really really bad!,Bridesmaid was as overrated as movies get. 90% annoying 10% funny. Couldn't bear to sit through it. 1 star is generous.
1,Boring and Sad,Amazon does not give the option to give minus points. I give the movie a -5 stars. How anyone could think this film was funny should be in therapy. There was nothing funny about watching someone having a meltdown. There was no cohesive plot and the actors were horrible at their craft. Can I have my money back?
1,Waste of time,This film was absolute garbage. I endured 30 minutes of it and decided I wasn't going to waste any more of my life watching it. Didn't raise a smile once. Several people had told me it was funny......maybe they were watching a different version to me?
5,Hilarious!!,"Bridemaids is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The funniest, raunchiest comedy of the year! It was amazing! I just had to buy the DVD after seeing it for, I don't even remember how many times I saw it in theaters! Go buy it!"
2,Comedy??,"I was over 10 minutes into this movie when I realized it was a comedy and I hadn't even cracked a smile, let alone laughed. Horrible pacing, wooden acting and the cast had no chemistry together. I love my comedies, I love to laugh. This is not one of those movies. I hate to leave a bad review for anything but this one just screamed out for it. Whoever gave this script and casting the greenlight seriously made an error."
5,Hilarious,I thought it was going to be another one of those chick flicks. I was so wrong. I love it.
2,Bridesmaids,I thought this movie was overall disappointing. Everyone raved about it in the media but I did not care for it.
4,Funny,"I'm not one to watch a movie more than once, but this movie is the exception. The more I watch it, the funnier it gets. Love the female comedic geniuses, especially Melissa"
1,The most repugnant and tasteless chick flick ever,I am not a prudish person. I am very open and considered liberal in my views however foe me this movie tops them all in vulgarity. from the beginning to the end it seemed like and endless rehash of the super ego of ms. Whig. If you got therapy why did you feel it important to redo your angst so we all could participate? Many scenes just made me and my husband cringe. I felt sorry for the actors to have to say and act out your demons. Now I hear you are making another movie where you do it all. Give it up.
1,Most overrated movie of 2011,"I'm not sure which is more unfortunate, the screenwriting for the movie or Kristen Wiig's performance being deemed comedic. As on SNL, she comes across as desperate and one dimensional, hardly someone who could hang with some of the female comedic legends e.g. Gilda Radner, Lily Tomlin, or even Tina Fey and Ellen. Melissa McCarthy is the one sort-of bright spot, and even she goes beyond comedy to just plain gross in too many moments. The character development overall is lacking and the plot is predictable. How so many people rated this movie so highly I cannot fathom, but there are plenty of other films out there which try half as hard and manage to produce better results."
5,FUNNIEST COMEDY OF THE LAST 10 YEARS!,"Kristen Wiig knocks it out of the park with this snarky comedy about the competitiveness and complexity of women's friendships -- especially when a close friend decides to get married. Wiig's facial expressions say it all. One of my favorite scenes: the escalating argument between Wiig, who plays Annie, a disgruntled jewelry store sales clerk, and a bratty teenage girl who attempts to buy a birthday present for her BFF. Also seeing the yummy Jon Hamm playing a total cad (who makes Don Draper look respectful) is a real treat."
2,Predictable and low brow,"Funny in a predictable sort of way.If you watch movies regularly, nothing in this movie will surprise you. Its vulgar and the people in the movie aren't like any people you know or will ever meet. Will someone tell hollywood to stop trying so hard to be funny and just be funny."
1,This movie was terrible!,"This movie was terrible! My boyfriend and I watched it in the theater, and we both walked about feeling we wasted our money! There were a couple funny parts, but the acting, language, and storyline of the movie--ALL TERRIBLE! Would not recommend this movie to anyone!"
2,Wish Amazon allowed a separate publisher/provider review,"I love Kristen. Glad she made this. Movie is 3.5-4 stars. Hate to taint reviews of the movie with this, but it won't change the aggregate rating anyway: I gotta vent about the pre-expired downloadable ""Digital Copy"". Bought the movie mid-May 2012. The enclosed digital download expired February 25th 2012. I didn't think it was possible for me to be more p****d off at the stupidity and shortsightedness of the content providers. It was. And, yeah, theoretically, I know there are other options that involve only a little time and inconvenience but, of course, it would be wrong to mention those. DMCA. Thought and speech control. Thanks again, Hollywood dorks.Not you, Kristen."
4,Funny movie!,"As always, Amazon service was prompt and efficient. I was notified of the shipment and it was here the second day after that. The movie was very funny. We enjoyed it!"
4,b.d.b dvd audio,"Am I the only one out here that is missing the last five seconds of I LOVE THE DEAD ! I am very impressed with the sound of the RHINO remix,and the missing five seconds may seem trivial;but I am sure that any real fan would want their,,daduh,,daduh..NOTHING!!"
4,Still great...,"This is the last completely solid set from the original Alice Cooper band. It is an excellent finale, with all of the same wonderfully twisted elements as the three previous efforts.The main standouts on this one are ""Unfinished Sweet"", ""Generation Landslide"" and one of only two songs about necrophilia that I've ever heard (the other is Cold Ethyl on Welcome to My Nightmare). Only Alice could make a song about something so repulsive so enjoyable. It is gleefully wicked and packed, as always, with the dark humour that was Alice's trademark. Alone, worth the price of admission. Once you've heard it, you'll never be quite the same.....(insert diabolical laughter here)"
4,Killer,"Great release, this. I'd love to see a remastering of the band's finest- KILLER. Some added live stuff from the ""71 era would add to this fine band's legacy."
5,Affluent Society was a partly factual and interesting book.,"The Affluent Society was a term to describe the United States after World War II. An Affluent Society is rich in private resources but poor in public ones because of a misplaced priority on increasing production in the private sector. John Kenneth Galbraith argued that the U.S. should shift resources to improve schools, the infrastructure, recreational resources, and social services providing a better standard of life instead of mor and more consumer goods. The term is now used to indicate prosperity, wide spread I shouldn't tell you any more or it would spoil your experience when you read it. It was a great book. John Galbraith game some great opinions which he truly believed in. I would reccomend this book to anyone who is into American history."
5,A great book for Spiritual growth,"Charles Stanley touches on every aspect of what the Christian is to experience from the indwelling of God's Holy Spirit. He gives guidelines. He asks important questions, and then answers them. At the end of every chapter he reviews the chapter and asks the reader questions pertaining to his or her life. I would recommend this book to any Christian who is hungry for growth in Christianity. It's like a how to book. Only it teaches how to listen and know when God's Holy Spirit is speaking."
5,Must See Movie by Steven Seagal,This is a must see action packed movie we highly recommends it to anyone that is a Steven Seagal fan/collector. My husband had been looking for a copy of the Belly of the Beast DVD for years and was happy when I found it on the Amazon.com website. He loves this movie and had tried to find it at serveral of the the local video stores and was told they didn't carry it in their inventory. Thanks Amazon.com for your vast collection of Steven Seagal movies including the classics which we still love to watch.
4,A good review for a change,"I have read reviews about Seagal and his movies and I don't see anything good mentioned. His movies never claimed to be ""high art"" or have a lot a lot of special effects. You get plain, solid action. I really like Belly of the Beast. Steven was very good.In the belly of the beast he is unrelenting in getting his daughter back. Review of his movies talk about Seagal's bad acting and that is not the case in this movie. The girl who is his daughter might be guilty of bad acting but not Seagal. Judging but his reviews everyone thinks he sucks. If he does why do you keep going back and watching the movies? I say if you can't write a decent, fair review of Seagal and his movies then just dont' bother to rent or buy them. As for me I really like them and I hope he contines to make more even if they are ""straight to dvd""."
4,THIS IS THE WAY A GOOD SEAGAL MOVIE IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE,"AFTER HIS LAST MOVIE, ''THE FOREIGNER'', WHICH BY THE WAY, WAS VERY DISSAPOINTING, SEAGAL RETURNS WITH THIS COOL MOVIE. AN EX CIA AGENT [SEAGAL] LEARNS THAT HIS DAUGHTER WERE KIDNAPPED BY TERRORISTS. INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR THE CIA TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, HE TAKES MATTERS INTO HIS OWN HANDS. HAS VERY GOOD FIGHTS AS WELL AS GOOD STUNTS. THIS IS A MUST HAVE SEAGAL MOVIE. WHO KNOWS, IF SEAGAL LOSES WEIGHT, WE MIGHT JUST GET THE OLD STEVEN SEAGAL BACK!"
3,BELLY OF SEAGAL???,"I kinda liked this movie despite the fact Lord Steven stil looks fat. He hides it well in this flick which has great action and a storyline to boot. What has happened is... Seagal has retired from the C.I.A. Later his young daughter is kidnaped while running around with her best friend who's father is high up in our goverment. Both girls are treated badly by the Yung kuo tribe. Seagal goes out on his own(big suprise huh?) to rescue them. And like he says to the police ""if your not on my side your in my way"" There is several good martial art fights in the movie with good effets in each. Seagal leaves a staggering body count as his hell-bent mission goes deep into the soo-won cain dynasty. Later he fights the cann u sing clan and the moh sgr gee clan and no trouble at all with the win do kin clans."
2,Not for the scholary reader,"Just an FYI - this does not give a ""scholary"" account of a real lawyers confessions, but if you are a white male from the south then you will probably enjoy it - sorry for the pun on stereotypes, but likewise this book is full of them... sort of misogynistic too.."
2,My First Sparks Read,"This being the first book I actually read of sparks, I think I may have set myself up for failure. The story in itself was ok, but tended to drag some. AND I hated the ""explination"" for the lights. With all the magic of words at his finger tips and he chose to use logic rather than magic.In a world with too much reality.. I was expecting some Far reaching belief to come into play.. so this really left me wanting."
3,No Sparks this time,I usually love Nicholas Sparks' books but this one seemed to drag on and on. I couldn't feel the connection between Jeremy and Lexie. So predictable but was hoping that they would say goodbye in the end so as to end the boredom of their relationship.
3,He's Done Better,"I was given this book as a gift for my birthday. I have all his books, so I'd have it regardless of how I enjoyed it. It was so... well, I think he's written this book before. It's just okay. I don't recommend this book for those who want to try Nicholas Sparks for the first time. I recommend borrowing the book before buying it."
2,BOOOORING,"I am a HUGE Sparks fan and can usually devour one of his novels in a day. It took me a few days (on vacation even!) to get through this one. It was boring, short on the romance and was actually a chore to get through. Since I'm familiar with all of his other work, I trudged on but c'mon Chapter 20 before it even got cracking?? I almost adopted the ""50 page rule"" and put it down but I'm far to anal to not finish a book. Let's hope his next one is more up to par..."
3,A real let down.,"As much as I hate to say it, I was really disappointed by this one. I am a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks and have read all of his books. This one was really kind of boring. I am going to read ""At First Sight"" when it is released because I am a true fan, but I really hope the charaters a re a little more developed in that one."
4,Great summer read!,"Easy read and very entertaining. Kept me wanting more, enjoyable from cover to cover. Read it in less than a week, perfect book to grab and take to the beach!"
3,First Nicholas Sparks book,"This was my first time reading a Nicholas Sparks book. I wanted to pick a book that not EVERYONE had already read and talked about, and that wasn't a movie yet. It seems pretty typical Sparks-style from what I've heard. Sappy, slow, and romantic. It was a good book with a unique story, but not necessarily my cup of tea."
3,Not one of my favorites,"I always eagerly await a new book by Nicholas Sparks, but was disappointed when I finished True Believer. It was predictible AND I didn't shed one tear."
2,Huge Dissapointment,"I have read all of Nicholas Sparks novels, loving them all, until True Believer....It was a huge dissapointment to me, one of the most boring stories I've ever read and chapter after chapter, I kept WAITING for him to get to the STORY.....I knew much more about Jeremy, his job, etc. than I ever cared to know and so little other than the LIGHTS he was going to go research,the story seemed to end for me there.His love stories are always so wonderful with reading I can hardly put down but this one?? I could hardly stay AWAKE reading it.....I finished it last night, tomorrow it goes to the used book store as I won't even pass it on to my friends, who also are fans of Nicholas Sparks...."
3,3 stars,"Jeremy Marsh has made a career out of debunking psychics and other paranormal phenomena. As his star rises toward fame, he discovers what may be the case to usher in even greater good fortune. A small town has a legend of ghost lights haunting a cemetary. Finding the truth behind that could be his big break, but Jeremy has discovered something truly magical; the way he feels about Lexie, the grandaughter of the town's psychic. She has a special bond with the lights, a memory about them too beautiful to shatter. Moreover, finding the truth could speed the little burg's demise. Jeremy is caught in a dilema. Will he chose his head, heart, or wallet?*** Though interesting and moving, this story lacks some of the heart found in Mr. Sparks' earlier works. There is intriguing trivia peppered throughout the story. You will not regret reading this story, even if it has a bit less magic than Walk to Remember or Message in a Bottle. ***Amanda Killgore"
3,Predictable Sparks,"For Sparks fans, ""True Believer"" was not much of a surprise. The ""twist"" at the end of the book was predictable at the very first mention of the Doris's ""gift."" But, it was an easy read and enjoyable nonetheless. If you are a Nicholas Sparks fan, then you won't be disappointed. If you are looking for a true mystery book about the supernatural then this is NOT for you!"
3,Not Sparks best,While this book was very interesting. For some reason it was extremely hard to get into and didn't hold my attention as well as Mr. Sparks other books This defenitly isn't my favorite of his books.
2,Sparks' Worst,"Good writers sometimes produce bad works. This is the case. I liked most of Sparks' works, particularly ""Eight Weeks with My Brother"" and ""The Rescue"". But ""True Believer"" is the worst he has ever written. It is almost like listening to an old man murmuring to himself. Most of Sparks' books were based on his family or personal experiences. This time he is indeed out of his element and out of style writing a subject and characters that are not based on the familiar theme.It seems to me that the author has turned himself into a machine trying to produce books by schedule. Sadly, great literary works do not come out in this fashion. Even though I still look forward to his future better works, I cannot give a passing grade to this book. Save your money, time and frustration!"
2,Obviously Cranked Out on an Assembly Line,"Hmmm....I think Nicholas Sparks cranked this one out in a paint by numbers style. Cardboard characters, predictable plot, and every cliche in the book. Ironically, the characters of this small town are very worried that the big-city reporter, Jeremy, will portray them as stereotypical southern hicks...they should have worried about Nicholas Sparks doing that instead. All of the characters are good ol' boys who like huntin' an' fishin' or sugar sweet gals with hearts of gold and heads full of air. You've got your brash small town mayor, your not too bright sheriff's deputy, your waitress from the local truck stop, and all the usual town gossips. They eat grits and say ""LIB"" (Well, I'll be!). The story is totally void of any emotional depth, and the writing is amateurish, at best. Shallow, insulting to the intelligence. Definitly not Mr. Sparks best work."
2,Scientific Inaccuracies in book,"Jeremy Marsh, who is supposed to be a debunker of scientific myths, blatantly states one of the biggest scientific misconceptions on page 251 (paper back) when discrediting the moon as a possibility of causes the mysterious lights in the cemetery. He states that the moon's light could not have been a factor because ""...a new moon, when the moon was hidden by the earth's shadow..."" was present when he sees the cemetery lights. A new moon is in fact when the dark or unilluminated portion of the Moon faces directly toward Earth when the illuminated half of the Moon faces directly toward the Sun and has nothing to do with the Earth's shadow (lunar eclipse). This is beside the fact that 26 pages earlier ( p225) he notes ""In the moonlight her (Lexie) features were unreadable..""I'm all for a good story, but when it comes to scientific facts supporting the plot in this book I have to say that I am far less than a ""True Believer."""
4,Easy read,This was a nice clean book. It had romance without a lot if sex. I wish more authors would learn to write cleaner. I like to share books with my grand kids but most of them have too much sex.
3,Usual Nicholas Sparks,Good read and typical plot of N. Sparks. If you enjoy his books you will like this one.Good read.
1,A Sparks disappointment,"Oh how I waited with bated breath for Nicholas Sparks' new release! And oh how disappointed I felt as I struggled through this ""Danielle Steel""-like book. The Notebook and Message in a Bottle rank as 2 of my all time favorite books. True Believer, however, did not make a true believer out of me. The whole story was unbelievable from the very beginning. Too much for me to believe that 2 people that have just met can instantly know that they are in love, oh please. There is no depth to this book. The characters are implausible, shallow, and very predictable. It seems as thought Mr. Sparks is trying to follow a formula that he thinks will sell, a la Danielle Steel. He should spend more time visiting the truth in life and love-as in The Notebook-and less time giving us this pulpy mess, and expecting us to swallow it..."
3,Disappointed,I was disappointed in Spark's newest story. It was not near as good as the others and felt like he had to really stretch to come up with this one. It was very slow moving with a lot of unneeded conversations. The story was a little hard to believe and didn't seem likely. The relationship between the journalist and the small town girl he meets was stiff and just did not mesh. I have read all of Spark's books but I am sorry to say that this one was just not as likeable as the rest.
3,Not as good as the rest,"I really enjoy Nicholas Sparks' books, and liked True Believer, but was disappointed. I agree with other reviewers that it lacked the ""oomph"" of his other books. It is lacking the tragedy that really tears at your heart. His other books have been tear jerkers and this one is not. At least not to me."
2,upset about this one.,"I have to say I love Nicholas Sparks and I have read everything he has written. I am not sure what happend here. I am so upset by this book. I kept reading thinking it has to get better and it didn't Sorry Nicholas, I will sure buy any other books he writes, But I would pass this one up."
3,Least favorite Sparks book,"I have read almost all of Nicholas Sparks books. I am a HUGE fan. After reading the back, I was thinking this was going to be my favorite one....wrong. There isn't anything thrilling about the paranormal stuff going on as you may think. I think the ""love"" part of this story is the most unrealistic plot yet. Jeremy fell so hard for her within a few days of just speaking to her....yeah right.(It worked in ""Dear John"", but not this novel) I didn't connect with either one of the main characters. I didn't feel butterflies or any kind of emotion like I usually do with Sparks. I strongly disliked Lexie. She is a snob and she is so stuck in her ways. Hopefully,""At First Sight"" will be better. Out of all of his great books why did he make a sequel to his worst one?"
1,Where is Nicholas Sparks?,"I think Mr. Sparks is channeling Danielle Steel. This trite piece of ""literature"" was not even a good enough to classify as a ""light summer read"" (in my humble opinion). I mean, how many times can a writer have his character ""roll her eyes"" to indicate flirting, exasperation, etc.? When he had the main male character roll his eyes as well, it was simply irritating. This is so NOT the Nicholas Sparks I had come to love through his earlier works. I feel as if Mr. Sparks has sold out...is he required by his publisher to churn out a specific number of novels in a time frame? If so, he is doing this with complete disregard to substance, quality, and plot."
2,This is a great product!,"I use Excellence in 9.5N. I was so happy that this root touch up worked so well. It matched perfectly. I have a few grays, so I left it on for 15 minutes. I guess this is high lifting, because it works so quickly. All in all, this product is saving my hair because I truly do wait almost six weeks now to redye my hair. Bravo, Clairol!"
5,Dark brown #4 provides very good gray coverage,Just used it last night. Looks natural as can be. Shiny and healthy. I thought it best to use a darker than normal shade since my roots are very dark brown with alot of gray and the longer hair is reddish brown naturally.
1,Do not buy this product,"Ok I was trying to save money by doing my grey roots between salon colorings of my medium brown hair. My roots turned orange, bright clown like orange....and I followed the instructions to the letter. So guess what, i'm off to the hair salon tomorrow for a professional color. I do not recommend this product."
2,"Sparkly, but no substance","I bought this toy for my one-year-old when she was about 4 months old, lured by vague claims of ""classical music"" educating her or something. In the staring-at-bright-things phase, she was interested in looking at it for a very little while, but quickly moved on to other, more interactive toys. Frazzled moms, take note: it really doesn't turn off! It's very pressure-sensitive, which means that every time toys settle in the toybox you get treated to Muzak Mozart, and usually when you're trying to calm the baby down for a nap. If you are a very patient person, the piping music may not bother you. However, if you're anything like me, the extremely loud, cheesy and endless renditions of vaguely familiar songs may irritate you beyond belief."
2,A waste.,Disappointing. I'm sorry that I did not pay better attention to some other reviewers before I wasted my money on this tiny volume. Limited and superficial coverage.
5,"WOW, I love these.",The construction and feel of these tools makes working with them a pleasure. These feel comfortable in large hands and easy to manage fine work.
5,"I like soul with a capital ""S""","Oh yeah ! This sounds so hot to me.In this album you can hear the mellowness,cool funknes inspired by JAMES BROWN.This album is too hot to handle.Handle with care so that you will not be carried away so far.These soul music searchers are so eager to tighten up the band sound.Sit back and loosen up yourself in the OAKLAND WHITE FUNK WAY.Well-structured brass section will hit you in the face.This album won't get you wrong.Do buy this CD."
4,I've used a lot of different hair-repair conditioners ...,"I've used a lot of different hair-repair conditioners in the past. I have long hair and had it permed about seven months ago. I used this every time I washed my hair, and could tell a difference in the ends of my hair after the second time I used it. I'd recommend it to anyone -- I think it's a great product. I think the price may be a little steep, but I'd still buy it."
4,Great smelling leave-in -conditioner,This is a very good product to use during summer time. It leaves my hair smelling great without any sticky residue on my hair. Great product to use before going swimming.
4,Best for the price...,"The best smelling and most effective leave in conditioner for the price.At least out of all the ones I've used.Only thing is that if you have really thick hair you have to use a lot, but otherwise it's great."
3,It's conditioning.,"This smells amazing, and it's worth using the rest of the bottle for that reason alone.After using this, once my hair is dry, my hair is very soft. I'm not sure I've noticed any lasting results, though.I dislike the spray-pump applicator, as it gets tiring trying to get all your hair wet spraying it like that. If it were a trigger sprayer I'd appreciate it more.Overall, I probably won't be buying this again."
3,This conditioner would have been fine for someone ...,"This conditioner would have been fine for someone with normal hair. It worked as any normal conditioner would. However, for a product that claims to be good at repairing dry hair, it didn't live up to its claims. It softened my hair, but did nothing to give it more moisture. Overall, I was not happy with this product."
5,Useful and perfect,"It is exactly as I expected, very useful, easy to clean, it gets all the dust so easily without leaving residue behind."
5,Excellent Cleaning Cloth for iPad,"I've tried lots of things to clean my iPad screen, and this is by far the best product that quickly gets the screen shining all new again."
4,Great introduction to stock patterns,"Although this book was written some time ago, the basic principles of the use and analysis of stock chart patterns has not changed. The technology has changed and it is even easier now to bring up charts on your computer and search for patterns. I like Jiler's description of patterns particularly when he brings in market psychology to help understand why patterns develop in the first place. I also like the examples he provides at the end of the chapters; real stock chart patters are more sloppy and usually harder to recognize than the ""ideal"" pattern.Continue your investing education at my blog HowToStudyFinance .com"
4,pretty good,"i bought this boat because it was cheep and i wanted an rc boat.i played with it alot in lakes, pools and ponds and it was alot of fun but a month later i was driving it in the lake. when i took the boat out of the water it was full of water. when i got back home my dad and i opened it up to find a ton of water inside the engine and that made the boat not be able to turn right. it was fun while it lasted.

4,"Good, at first...","At first I wasn't too happy when I got this game... But when I played it, I was thrilled. After I beat the game in a week, I played it trying to get as many characters as possible, but i liked a computer game better. This game doesn't have the best graphics because it's animated. There are lots of characters. If you buy this game you will be entertained for a little while."
2,I wouldn't recommend this product for someone who ...,I wouldn't recommend this product for someone who wants to lighten his or her hair easily and carefully. The directions were much more like those of a permanent color than I expected. I was hoping for a different version of my spray-in lightener and I didn't get it.
3,too light weight,"I got this years ago, and I'm just now finally doing reviews on other products and this came up. I guess I didn't do it back then.I got this because of the Lat bar attachment. I was surprised at how flimsy and light weight the whole bench is. It is narrow and doesn't feel as secure as the Olympic-style one I had. It does have a good feature in that it can be folded to get it out of the way, but I've never tried this. I find myself using the other bench for everything and this on only for the Lat bar.If I had known that is how it was, I would have gone with a different option to obtain a Lat bar."
5,The Romance series has always served its purpose.,"Anyone who is even mildly interested in warfare, or internal wars featured in China will be extremely addicted to this game. The fact that you can customize generals will add replay value to this game, far more than any other. I highly recommend this game if you are in to turn based, month by month, strategy, with turn based warfare, and diplomatic missions.Koei is to strategy, as Squaresoft is to roleplaying."
2,Orgasm Whats that ?,I am a girl ..that I must say has never had an orgasm before so what can this video do for me that no can else can? My boyfriend and I have been trying to get me to have an orgasm and nothing happens.Whats a girl supposed to do ?
4,Worth it!,"The ""roadmap"" Dr. Villers provides make finding the spot idiot-proof. She's professional and humorous, and the couples look very ""normal"". Definitely worth the money!"
3,My are Children's Book violent?,"My twins love to hear Custard's two books, but I wonder why a character always needs to be killed? Is this how we introduce our children to the concept of death? I'd prefer both books resolve their conflicts with an alternative solution, bt I know it's too late for a revision!"
3,Pretty cool...,"This set is pretty small in size. You only get 2 minifigs: C-3PO and R2-D2. You can fit these 2 minifigs in the pod and open it up easily. This set is pretty simple with really easy instructions. It is pretty small, but if you have other Star Wars LEGO sets that you own, you can have a pretty big adventure playing with them. I recommend this set to Star Wars LEGO fans, cuz you can add it to your collection, and I also recommend this set to children that likes to build simple sets. Hope this review helped you!"
4,Visually perfect; a little lacking in depth.,"Ingenious ways to organize just about every part of your house and inspiring photos of that oh-so-Martha style make this book a must have for any Martha fan or compulsive neat-nick. However, for those looking for a all-out guide to organizing, this book is more fluff than stuff. While you do get to see a lot of the ideas, the pictures limit the amount of space for instructions and tips. Most, if not all, of the ideas come from her magazine, so for those of us stock-piling issues and issues of it, this book provides a to-the-point compilation. Mostly useful for inspiration and as a visual guide, look elsewhere for much more. Not as lengthy as I might have liked--- I hope Martha comes out with a more comprehensive guide in the future. I'd recommend this to fans of the Martha style only."
2,Organizing by Martha Stewart,"There are few good ideas in here. After spending money for the book, I found that I would be SPENDING more money to get organized."
4,just taste it,"In my opinoin this is really a wonderfull job, he used to play harmonica amazingly, whit much taste and a lot of technique. There is a kind of complicity between guitar and harmonica that i rarely identified in someone else. the only pity is the quality of registration that surely is not the best"
1,Not worth $20.00,This item is poorly made. Very flimsy pressed cardboard boards and the face finish is a decal that peels off. Halex can do much better!
4,Kids really like this,"We had received one of these activity books before as a gift. My 3 and 1/2 yr old son loves it, so we got him another one. The pages are thick and so it works great with the do-a-dot markers. It is a bit pricey for the amt of pages that you get, but still worth it."
5,Brick City's Finest (EP),"I think the project is a very selection being that it is the first professional release by Bishop. I predict that with more marketing exposure for future releases, he could be the next greatest element since Tupac, with his lyrical deliver he will definitely have longevity in the game!!"
1,You dont want this,This should have remained a secret especially that wack azz shi@ by Gary Payton and Jason Kidd Pure Garbage if you want this you must be Jordan laughing at the idiots trying to make music
4,Panic Mouse Kitty Go Crazy,My cat likes the 'talking' ball and the jingle ball in the track pretty well. She seems totally uninterested in the twirly bit at the top. Oh well. I buy a lot of toys for her and she is interested in about half of them. I end up donating the toys she does not like at all to the local rescue groups. They have enough cats to be sure to have a few who love the toys. I just shake my head and try a different toy.
2,Ah woof woff,"This one is really annoying-aside from the fact that it is loud-it does next to nothing that it claims-save your time, money and the stress of you child saying ""MOMMY THIS THING IS NOT WORKIN"" RIGHT!!!"""
1,DON'T SPEND THE MONEY,"I bought this puppy for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas. Everytime we went into the store, she cried she had to have this dog. It does nothing. It barks and wags his tail. It does not actually walk with you. She has no leash and you are suppose to call her; but she doesn't come. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. We are going to return it."
2,disappointed,"This was on the top on my daughters Christmas list. I think she has played with this for less than 5 minutes total since she received this on Christmas Eve. It doesn't come when you call it, just usually turns and goes in other direction. She almost started crying the first time she called it to come to her & it kept walking away from her. The constant barking is annoying. Go-Go spends most of her time turned off siting in a corner. It definitley is not worth the money! I do like the movement in general. It moves easily on carpet & doesn't fall/tip over the way other walking dogs do. Save your money!"
2,Stopped working the day after christmas,"the toy stopped working the properly the day after the christmas. I had brought it for my 2 year old daughter, but when she called it, it wouldn't come, walk, bark or do anything. We would be sleeping in the middle of the night and the dog would start barking, and walking by itself (the batteries were brand new, so there is no excuse. Needless to say we immediately returned it the store."
3,not so great!,"holes on arm did not match up! bottom also my husband had to fix ,thank god he knows how to do this like this because i would of had to return it..... not happy also has green paint on it ?????? not much but it there??and it also say its for birth and up . i would say its for child 2or3years of age and up."
3,Black Betty,This was not a whole book. I am disappointed that this seems more like half of a story than reading a full story.
3,NOT HIS BEST,"THIS IS SO SHORT AND I DIDN'T LIKE THE VOICE OF THE READER, BUT I'M INTENT ON COMPLETING THE EASY RAWLINS SERIES SO I FINISHED IT."
4,"Worth it for ""Back in the Sadle Again""","I was (and still am) a Gene Autry fan, with his soothing mellow voice and easy manner that managed to vanquish everything from train robbers to mole men (really).But like most things from your childhood, he really isn't as good as your memory suggests when you revist him. Which is where the Riders come in ...""Back in the Saddle Again"" on this album is done the in the polished, rich and mellifluous way that Gene Autry should have done it. It's worth the album for this one track alone.The rest of the album is also very good, if a tad repetitive. The Riders have the polish that the old cowboy singers lacked. What they seem to lack in this album is immagination.But it's purty music just the same."
4,RTFM! Pretty Cool!,"Ok, I read all of the reviews BEFORE getting this for my 4 year old. Lets get a couple of things straight: If you follow the directions EXACTLY, you won't have an issue. This thing worked right out of the box! It took us about 30 min. I really took my time & read ALL of the instructions first! All most every one of the parts are labeled clearly eg. A1 -> A1. If you think that a 4-year old is gonna put this together, you are smokin rope!The green car seems to work better than the yellow car. A flat, hard, non slippery surface is best. We assembled it on the burber (sp?) carpet in the basement. It take up about a 4X4 foot area, and is 4 feet tall. Kinda big.Durable. I think not. As soon as we move it, I am sure that all the connections will need to be checked.We paid 20 bucks for it at our local Toys-R-Us. Other than that he is happily playing with it right now."
5,Kids 6 and 4 years old love it!,"Cyborg is a great toy. Me and my brother both love this toy a lot. (written by Sydney, the 6 year old)Assembled easily in about 15 minutes. (written by dad)"
3,Not worth the money,I purchased the toy for my 5 yr. old son for Christmas and he was really disappointed with it. The Cyborg head won't stay latched and the cars the come with it will not go all the way around the track. It's really upseting when your son asks why Santa brought him a toy that doesn't work. Not at all worth the money!
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"My 6 year old son just purchased this with money he received for Christmas (he has been wanting it for months)... so we were quite excited to go to our local Toys R Us to go get it!After 2 hours of assembly (I followed the instructions step-by-step so I'm confident that I put it together correctly) we could not get the ""tall"" track to swing into the Cyborg's mouth. It always fell about a 1/2 inch short. It was EXTREMELY dissappointing to my son to say the least, and EXTREMELY frustrating to me after spending 2 hours putting it together. I'd spend your money on a different Hot Wheels track... unless you want to have an unhappy little boy on Christmas morning. Thank goodness Santa didn't bring this one!"
3,"corelle impressions bake and serve 3-piece bowl set, callaway","Wouldn't it be nice to receive 5 stars? These bowls work just great and do everything they say. They are very heavy and durable. So, why couldn't they have come from Corning, NY instead of China? Yep...those five stars sure would be nice."
3,What about it?,"First - not bad, acting was good, script was well thought out and film quality was okay, but by the end, I was ready for it to be over and doubt I will re-watch it. Really needed a lot more action puncutation and some more energy - my regret, is that if you look at the ""infected"" make ups in the special features - hey - there was some really GOOD make ups done, but we barely get to see it in action - with the care in the make up that was evident (in special features), this could have been so much more of an exciting and re-play value film....or as Moses would have said....""Let my Zombies, go!"""
1,After the Yawn,"In a post-apocalyptic America, a young woman toting a firearm and accompanied by a mute boy goes in search of her brother. There's little action or suspense along the way, the use of voice-over narration becomes a bit grating, and the occasionally surreal touches create more muddle than interest. The cast and crew probably had great fun during filming but it all comes across as nothing more than a home-movie trying to palm itself off as a feature."
3,Out of stock?,"I don't know what is taking so long, but I haven't received it yet. Other Bratz movies have been great. Five year old granddaughter requested ""Fairy Tales""."
2,Not so bad.,"I let my four-year-old granddaughter look with me on my Kindle Fire for a bedtime story, and once she saw this nothing else would do for her. I was not especially eager to let her watch a Bratz flick, but she was insistent and I was weak so we did. She loved it and I was relieved that the content was not so bad, although not really too great either. I found myself somewhat interested in the story line, and the characters were not really ""mean girls."""
5,Fairytale spin,"This is a cute spin on some classic fairytales. If you have a daughter and you like the classics, you will both enjoy it."
3,Pretty Good,"I ordered these bands because the bands I had for my bootcamp workouts snapped and I was not able to find replacement bands without ordering a whole new package. So these were the next best thing i could find, they are tighter than the billy bands so they make the workouts hardered which is great but I still have to get used to using them."
3,Beautiful but...,"I bought this DVD after I watched Rudolf Nureyev's Raymonda documentary by Paris Opera Ballet since this is the only DVD available for the entire Raymonda performance. It is a beautiful ballet and the Russian dancers' turns are very fast. The part that I was disapointed was Abderarakhman. I am not talking about the dancer, he is really good, but it does not have the breath-taking choreography like the one I saw in Nureyev's version. Other than that it is a very good DVD to watch, except I had to fast forward everytime when there was a curtain call, it was long and almost everytime when a solorist finishes a variation. It was like watching a mini series of many variations instead of one whole ballet story. I am probably biased for Paris Opera Ballet so my feedback may not be fair. If I did not see Nureyev's documentary, this would have been one of my favorite ballet. It is beautiful."
3,The PIC Microcontroller,"Hi!I bought this book to have as a referenc for PIC processors.The book is perfect as intended and also good for beginners. Examples given makes a quick start for the reader...A good ""Best-"" bye! -Henrik"
3,Decent but with quirks that I dislike,"Gameplay is fun, takes a little getting used to, however the game had some quirks that I found very annoying. Now for the die hard fighting game fan, this could quite possibly be right up your alley, it is very challenging.Like one reviewer wrote, you start out getting your a## beat. And the difficulty settings do not seem to make any impact on how tough the computer plays. If your energy is running low at the end of a fight, then it is guaranteed that you will have your a## handed to you with a supermove by the computer. Annoyingly predictable. Too add insult to injury, after you have worked hard to beat an opponent and then get beat by the next opponent, gameplay gets reset to the beginning of the level where you have to play against the person you just beat again.Had potential, a worthy renter, but definitely not a keeper."
1,Heard of it through Goldberg's new book,"Every time I hear the term ""free thinker"" the immediate image, which comes to mind is just the opposite. Letting young kids react to supposed injustices without being old enough to understand them is not ""teaching"" it is called ""bad parenting"". Forming a child's mind to think that the Blue Angels would blow up their town is absolutely repulsive, and the author should be ashamed of herself no matter what her rationalization may be. What does she have them do for field trips, attend gay pride rallies with grown men dry humping each other while wearing nothing but underwear and bondage? Let them be kids for Pete's sake. They'll have plenty of time to grow cynical and hate values in high school and college."
3,Good but not the best Conrad,"As a true Conrad lover I must say that this is a very ggod read though not among Conrads greatest (Nostromo, the secret agent). To focus on the good points: it is less wordy than lesser works like Victory and has the (expected) cast of strongly drawn characters. The story seems a bit slow (doesn't Conrad always?) and Conrad readers may have a sense of dèja vu, but he lets the content develop out of the story and less from philosophical meanderings (cf. Victory again).The Shadowline is a good introduction to Conrad (either this or Heart of Darkness), but the master has given us better things"
3,Christmas,"Thought I would like this CD more, we really like Gregg Karukas and have some of his other CD's, this is our first Christmas CD by him and like I said it is OK"
4,Lots of use from this toy,"We bought this toy for our son when he was only 5 months old knowing he wouldn't be quite ready to sort the shapes yet. As soon as he learned to sit up, he really enjoyed putting the shapes (and other toys!) in and out of the jar. Something that is a learning process for infants. He is now 15 months and STILL plays with this cookie jar! It is extremely durable. As I read in another review the womans voice is a bit ""non-child-like"" and our friends had also joked about how she talks! I would still rate this toy highly based on the fact that it seems to be one of the toys our son has gotten the most use out of."
4,Fun for all...,"I bought this toy for my son for Christmas and at 9 months, it really has been an educatiional yet entertaining toy. Jaden actually gets that he has to put the blocks in the corresponding holes, he will clap when he does it. The key to this toy is to actually sit with your child and show him what it does. The first few times I would put the blocks in and clap my hands. Now my little boy has to do it or he will throw a fit. I always take time to show Jaden what the toys do. The toy itself is very durable, except I can't find the lid! It is a great toy and I am glad to have bought it."
1,does it ever stop!!...,"My toddler enjoys dumping the toys out, and at 2 is just getting to be able to put them back in through the slots. But this is a toy where you definetly need to take the batteries out when not in use or the music goes off just from walking by the room! Sometimes it goes off with no one anywhere near it! very annoying to have it wake up the baby or toddler in the middle of the night!"
4,Good for toddlers learning to sort shapes,"My son likes this toy and is learning to sort the shapes with it. However, we took out the battery because it would play music constantly - there was no On/Off switch!"
2,Beware! There can't be a more obnoxious toy!,"This has got to be the most obnoxious ""noisy"" toy my son has! There's no on/off switch and the slightest movement sends it off into it's annoying little diddy that you will not be able to get out of your head. It will drive you crazy.However, the worse thing is that the lid to the box is a thin piece of hard plastic. My son fell on the lid (as toddlers will do) when it was open, and ended up with a giant nasty welt on his leg! He cried more from that than any of his immunizations or his circumcision!As a shape/color sorter I suppose it's OK, but I'm sure that there are better, safer, and more quiet ones out there."
1,If you can't stand the noise,"This toy has the most annoying habit of cutting itself on. Quite frequently it would turn on even in the middle of the night. We finally had to take the batteries out of it so we could sleep through the night. Not a toy I would recommend if you do not want to be woken at 3 a.m. but its ""cutsie"" song."
2,"Cheap Price, but not worth it!","I bought this for my 1 year old. The music is very loud, annoying and turns on at the slightest touch (the button is on the bottom of the snail). There is no way to turn it off unless you remove the batteries. The blocks are not standard shapes(star, triangle, flower). It opens up very easily to get the blocks back out, but my daughter gets so frustrated trying to put the blocks in that she just opens it up and places them in it. So it looses a lot of its educational value. My daughter has had very little interest in this toy. I don't have anything good to say about this it and wish I would have saved the $10."
3,"Fun, but not why I thought it would be.",My 20 month old recieved this for Christmas when he was 6 months old. The base pops off and sings this tune. The very first time he heard it he was so excited. He has played this OVER AND OVER again. The music is cute and he is always playing it even still. I ended up putting the snail shell in the bath and that has become fun. It really became a toy he has grown with.
4,GREAT TOY,"I got this shapesorter toy for my 6 month old and she loves it. It plays music if you rock it, the shapes are stackable and the bottom of the snail can come off. Great toy."
5,The Little fur famioly,"This is the first book that any parent should buy for their child. It is more fun than any other book for the child, parent, grandparent or great grandparent."
5,Crisp overview of how the plane works (and doesn't),"Emergency Maneuver Training falls between basic flying and full-bore aerobatics. The idea is simple: if something goes wrong, you will know enough to get out of it.Stowell does a great job of walking you through how an airplane flies. What was especially useful was the description of how one would design an airplane from the ground up. Where he excels, however, is presenting it in a clear fashion without boring the reader.The book includes descriptions on recovering from inversions (perhaps you got caught in wake turbulence) to control systems failures (split ailerons; stuck elevator). I would also encourage the video, which complements the material well."
4,A marvelous sequel to a compelling series,"A very nice sequel, and to me somewhat different, even more complex than her her first book, The Salaryman's Wife. Where the Salaryman's Wife had an almost traditional small set of suspects in an out of the way Japanese Inn, but then moves to the urban setting of the city; Zen Attitude tends to sprawl all over Tokyo, until it becomes focused on the intrigues of a specific Japanese temple. Rei Shimura is running her small antiques business and purchases an old japanese chest. Unfortunately, everyone associated with the chest seems to be in danger or dead. Almost as interesting as the mystery itself are several personal complications with her boyfriend and his brother. The deft handling of what could easily be cliché romantic complications, was one of the books highlights; especially when the personal circumstances begin to parallel with the circumstances of the murder."
3,Not that helpful,"I was a little disappointed in this book overall. I thought it would have great activity ideas for my speech class, and they were just ""average"" or ""so-so"" ideas--nothing that workable or useful."
1,"The ""Essential... is unplayable","Several of the tracks would not play. If you don't mind only getting half of what you paid for, then go ahead and buy it."
4,A Very Fine CD,"I don't really know if Body Count are well-known out there in the US, but I just know one thing: they're good. Way before Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park mixed rap with rock (well, a little while after Run DMC with Aerosmith's ""Walk This Way""), they did the same thing, and sometimes even better, if you ask me. Ice-T was ""in front of his time""...What you'll find here is rap-like lyrics with, instead of rap beats, guitars, basses and drums. And it works.My favorite songs in here are ""KKK B****"", ""Smoked Pork"", ""Voodoo"", ""The Winner Loses"" and ""Body Count"".What's bad about this CD is that many of its lyrics are dumb and some songs don't quite work. If it wasn't for that, it would surely be a 5-star. Actually, I'd give this CD a 3.5 star, but since they were one of the first to mix rock with rap, I think they do deserve 4 stars. If you like Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park and other rap/rock bands out there, you should really listen to this. If you don't like, you should too. Peace out!"
2,"Great Metal,but Ice- T kind of ruins it.","Kick butt metal,great guitar by Ernie C, but Ice-T makes a real big deal about black musicians who play metal,like it hasn't been done before.(It Has). I liked a few tunes but there is alot of junk on here as well that isn't music involved.Such as ""Oprah"",all it is,is Oprah saying what is on the next show,and on another track is Jello Biafra harping about the PMRC and freedom of exprssion.Ice-T is the only one on this that don't take music or the lyrics seriously. He tends to annoy. I like versatility in some artists,but Ice-T fails miserably at giving metal a shot. He and Jello Biafra are the only flaws on this,unfortunely there BIG ONES!"
2,good shoe but chemical smell,"This is a nice enough shoe but the pair I bought came with a strong chemical smellthat takes weeks to dissipate -- and several months in, it is still noticeable.Probably has something to do with the processing of the leather. Anyway, I have neverhad a shoe that smelled this strong and for this long. It's not an unpleasant smellbut it is very noticeable. Maybe I just got a bad pair. Otherwise, the shoe is fine."
1,an horrible concert dvd,"Just a pathetic attempt. Terrible picture and editing. Sound quality worse than 80's concert dvds. This is from listening to it from 10 grand of audio equip-Martin S. should be ashamed of this effort. Get 4 licks and Big Bang, have 6 concerts and some directed by the master Hamish Hamilton!"
3,Stones shine a light,A friend had raved about this DVD and on that basis I bought It. Great production and visuals from Martin Scorsese. The man knows how to make films - but! I thought the set list from the Stones was lacking. Some absolute gems but considering the spotlight and opportunity a bit bland. I actually liked the extra songs included in preference to the mains. I love the Stones but was just a little disappointed.
3,illuminating,it shines a light into the realization that rock & roll is for the masses which includes the geriatrics too!
1,Didn't Get No Satisfaction,Don't buy this for the Music...The music is just BadDon't buy this for the Performance...The performance is LameDon't buy this for the Production... The production is confusedThis is a very disappointing DVD.Dont buy this......
4,pg13,"why would you cut this flim up or is it just for the dvd sale at walmart, how many 13 year olds do you think are going to buy this. these guys are old enough to be their grand parants for gosh sakes.put out the film the same as the cd and let it rock!!Shine a Light"
2,Do yourself a favor,"and rent/buy Ladies and Gentlemen to truly experience the Stones. Nothing good about this show other than the Buddy Guy appearance. Overdone strange arrangements, off key singing and the direction(ugh)"
3,Not Bad,"I would say that Jagger and Watts worked there butts off at this show,but all Wood and Richards want to do is flirt with the young ladies up front of the [...] on guys, it was so juvenile. The Bass Player is treated as a non-person throughout the concert which I didn't like either.Oh yeh, and Buddy guy's number is terrible. The band misses the chord changes several times. Buddy should not have allowed the performance to be seen by anybody.If you are a fan, or can get it cheap, I'd buy it though."
4,Made from wood - prone to chipping,"When I opened it, two pieces were chipped (this is pressboard afterall), but I could not be bothered returning it since a black permanent marker hid the problem. I was worried it would not support my 40 lbs receiver but its actually pretty sturdy. It looks good and is not imposing in the room. I would recommend it even thought the quality is not 5 star, it's worth its price."
3,I like it but...,"I saw a preview of it on my new Black Butler DVD, and I plan to buy it when it comes out, but is it just me, or does anyone who saw the preview think the plotline of the movie looks a little too much like one of the old Digimon movies? It's the one where that super digimon virus took over the internet, and the digidestined all teamed up with their digimon to enter digital internet space to stop the virus before it caused worldwide catastrophe while everyone around the digimon universe world with a computer watched the battle online and on tv? *lol*"
5,Summer Wars,"Simply put, this movie is beautiful. The plot, the animation, everything is like a moving work of art. I won't get into the plot since it seems other reviewers have already done so, but I highly recommend you buy this movie. I first watched it online for free and loved it so much I decided to buy it. This is the type of movie anyone will like, even if they aren't hardcore anime fans (like me). Watch it by yourself or with the whole family! So many movies nowadays have no deeper meaning, or are simply newer versions of older movies (I think we can agree that Hollywood is running out of ideas), but this movie really touched my heart.For some reason, I really like the DVD itself. It has a cardboard overlay that displays the characters as they are in Oz, and then the DVD package shows the characters as they are in real life. The inside has a family snapshot, and the CDs each have a very cute character icon. On packaging alone I'm sold!But seriously, buy this DVD. You will not regret it."
3,"Good animation, weak story.","So apparently the U.S. Government hires a Japanese national (!?) to create a super-virus AI thingy. It gets out, and then some chick manages to defeat the mother of all DDOS attacks from this thing by playing cards with it. Also there's the typical nerd-meets-hottie nonsense too."
2,Dull,Sorry. Furtwangler was a great conductor but as a composer all he could do was spin Wagner/Bruckner. There are a few interesting ideas but the work is just way too long to be worth while. If you have to have a copy of this thing try the Barenboim with the CSO. Its better.
3,"older, not better","Recently I purchased a CD of TOP recorded in '98 at the Fillmore. Great audio, so I decided to look at their earlier stuff. This particular CD reflects the poor recording techniques of the '70s and there are too many ballads on here for my taste. 'Squib Cakes' is my favorite as it's strictly instrumental. A remastered version of this would be appreciated."
1,Diana Who?,"Hunns,I'm still amazed that this child made it this far. She is soooooooooooooooooooo overated. She sings with no emotion and no conviction to the lyrics. She needs to stick with singing at church groundbreaking ceremonies, county fairs, butter queen pageants, talent shows and other corny stuff like that. I don't like her singing style. There is only one Barbra and only one Celine. Diana DeGarmo, please go back home to the farm. <wink>"
1,diana deGARBAGE,this is pure garbage.....the competition is stiff out there...the last thing anyone needs to listen is a frigid voice with high notes! I'd rather listen to someone who sings from her heart like FANTASIA....Diana started this comparison the minute she put out an album with the same songs as Fantasia!!! It just shows that she thinks she's better and I think that is what Fantasia fans are upset about. She should have chosen different songs for her album...be unique!
4,Surprising good,I like Diana and was quite surprised by this cd. Her voice is clear and shines thru on each of these songs. I don't like that people seem to want to lump Diana and Fantasia together and decide to review both their cd's. Both are certainly different singers.Diana will benefit with maturity. But you won't be sorry you bought this cd.
2,SCREAMING FOR AFFECTION!,KEEP YOUR MONEY IN YOUR WALLET BECAUSE ALL SHE DOES IS SCREAM AND THE ONLY GOOD SONG IS DREAMS SO IF YOU WANT TO SPEND YOUR MONEY ON ONE GOOD SONG AND THE REST IS TRASH THEN GO RIGHT AHEAD.I DISAPPROVE AND IF YOU WANT HER CD YOU CAN HAVE MINE FREE OF CHARGE.
3,Miss DeGarmo needs more time - a lot more.,"It is amazing how hard some people are trying to sell Miss DeGarmo and how difficult they are making it for people to buy music by the Winner of AI. Even Amazon pushes DeGarmo in your face when you do a search for Fantasia, and their software continues to push DeGarmo even when you check Not Interested?! Why? Probably because in reality Miss DeGarmo needs more time - a lot more. This CD is just okay... DeGarmo has an amazingly powerful voice, but power is not everything.. and that is why she didn't win AI and why Ms. London didn't either - DeGarmo lacks that special something - to be blunt, star quality eludes Diana.The competition was too strong and will always be. DeGarmo has had her chance and just didn't shine and may have been put into the limelight too soon. No matter how hard she is pushed now I expect that in a few years she will be forgotten based on the price her used CD is already selling for."
1,music lover,Diana can sing but she should never sing a song that Fantasia has already sung.After hearing Fantasia sing Dreams and I Believe on A.I. no one else can do them justice.I can`t wait for her album to come out to see if it`s better than this cd.
1,MS. PIGGY...DeGARBAGE screams her face off!!!,This cd is the pits......she is off key...all she does is scream her face off! if that 's what she wants to do maybe she should consider the opera. No comparison to Tasia.....BTW her sales rank is slipping as I type this review.....Tasia rules
4,Much better than I expected,"Wow! I was a semi-Diana fan during the show..but this single really surprised me..i was expecting pop fluff. Yet, ""Dreams"" is a very good song..and her voice sounds so mature and honest. ""Don't Cry Out Loud"" was the only slight disappointment..I loved it on AI..but this cd doesn't showcase how well she sang it live. On ""I Believe"" she sounds great and you would in no way know that she is only 16. Overall, this CD is Very good..just my personal preference of how the second song is performed. Great Job Diana!"
5,Lady Di Degarmo #1,"Diana is Talented, Beautiful, Miss Teen Georgia. At least she does NOT sound like Fantasia that Overdose's on Hellium before she sings..Fantasia Honey Auditions for the Wizard of Oz Munchins was 65 yrs ago."
1,Diana--Work In Progress,"If you want to buy a CD that is ""feel good"" music, I wouldn't buy Diana's Single. To me it's very bland and boring. It doesn't excite me or make me feel or think about anything. It's just O.....K... I am both a Fantasia and a Diana fan, but something about Fantasia's singing from the depths of her soul is just amazing and Diana is good too but---A Work In Progress. I would give her about five or six years to mature vocally and performance wise but even still, what Fantasia has, she was born with and Diana doesn't do it for me........maybe one day though, I'll be optimistic."
5,Diana makes the single amazing!,"Dreams- Is a slong song, yet Diana captures the emotion of it, and pours it out. The 2nd verse, that was not sung on Television shows was amazing. 9/10DCOL- I really like the version Diana sung On AI, but the producers wanted her to do the same version of Mellisa Manchesters. While Diana still brings out the emotion and power in the song, I wish they would have let her put her own spin on it. But she still does great. 8.5/10I Believe- I would have bought the single, just for this song! Its amazing! Incredible how well she did! I really dont know how else to describe, but its for sure you need to hear how awesome it is! 10/10"
1,SO AVERAGE...,"Diana DeGarmo has an okay pop voice. It just happens leave me me unbelievably bored and unsatisfied. She sings with no soul or conviction, and her high notes are just ""okay..."" She needs a lot of work on her lower range because she has a very dry one. In a competitive world of Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, Stacie Orrico, Hilary Duff, Ashlee Simpson, Avril Lavinge etc etc, I don't see where Diana DeGarmo can fit into this. Each of the artists that I mentioned brings something different to the table, wheras Diana is just like every one of them rolled into one. It's not a good thing."
5,Wow! What a CD!,"Although I am a loyal Fantasia fan, I must admit that Diana has released a great CD. I don't think her age should factor into her evaluation. I am glad that I bought her CD and look forward to future releases. I certainly encourage people to buy her CD."
5,The Best Sneakers Around!,"I absolutely LOVE Reeboks Women's Classic Running Sneakers - from the moment I tried them on I thought I was in ""foot heaven"", they are THAT comfortable!They're great for running, brisk walking, and just ""knocking around"". And, since they are all white, they pretty much go with anything.Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend Reeboks Women's Classic sneakers to everyone. Once you give them try, you'll never have to search for another brand again!"
1,Nada que ver,"Comprè este libro crellendo que era la traducciòn de la versiòn en inglès ( only love is real ) y la verdad nada que ver, lo que contiene este libro son puñados de frases que la verdad no me interesan, lo que no entiendo es como le van a poner el mismo titulo de otro libro realizado por el mismo autor, esto va a la basura."
3,apollo is back,this is a good story and adds to the battlestar galatica myth however the writing leaves a lot to be desired starbuck cried apollo cried sheba roared as an adult reading i didnt need this sort of comment to full in the scene for me keep trying richard i have moved on to warhawk just remember your not luke skywalker feel the force oh im sorry its telepathy we are talking about cheers
5,Battlestar Galatica Armageddon,"Battlestar Galatica Armageddon is one of the best books I have read in long time , this book was written by Richard Hatch and Mr Golden it contiues where the tv serial left before battlestar Galatica 1980 it starts where Starbuck has been lost , it a true Battlestar Galatica story I recommend any fan of this Tv show will love the book."
3,"LOVED BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, THIS BOOK WAS OK","I have missed the tv series Battlestar Galactica for quite some time.Thanks to Amazon.com, I have been able to view the series through the several videos offered. That is when I discovered this book. If Richard Hatch had concentrated more on the Cylons and the humans struggle with these demons, and less on his ""Use the Force Apollo"", this would have been a far better read. The book was also a bit immature at times. I think Richard Hatch takes himself and his character far too seriously. And yes, I will buy the next one. Why? It will hopefully continue the story and have less to do with the devil (Count Iblis) and the ""Force""."
3,It's okay,"It is ver repetitive. Most of the songs sound exactly the same, it sound like slick shoes killed the lead vocalist and hired the lead singer of new found glory. I don't care much for this cd, but I do like track 2 alot."
5,A delightful book by a wonderful naturalist,"Archie Carr was the Godfather of modern sea-turtle biology and an outspoken advocate of turtle conservation who did more than anyone else to bring our attention to these creatures. The Windward Road is a masterpiece of Natural History writing, capturing a magical moment in time as Carr delves into the secret lives of the great green turtles and takes us with him on journeys to Caribbean islands as yet largely unspoiled by the wave of development that was to come. Anyone interested in conservation biology or with a love of a good yarn should get hold of this book, sink back and hear the trade winds blow -and then get out of your chair & do something to carry on the struggle that Carr waged for so long to preserve turtles and their habitats. This is a book that you will come back to repeatedly & pass on to friends and students with enthusiasm."
4,Comfortable to wear,"I bought this instead of the Trend face shield, for better filtration and it's real comfortable for wearing for long periods of time, and it works well with my existing face shield for use with woodturning activities primarily. I bought it in medium size and have to play with the straps a bit when I put it on to get it to seal completely around the top of my nose, and I don't know if the large size would be better in this regard, which is the only reason for not rating it 5 stars."
5,She did it again!,"Another life changing message from Joyce. Since I became a Christian I have followed Joyce's teachings and my life has never been the same!Bethany K. ScanlonAuthor of Where's my mate?,Born of the Spirit and Redeeming Catholics"
4,Approval Addiction,"....For anyone who thinks ""people-pleasing"" will do anything for your social-life or personal self-esteem except leave you feeling frustrated and feeling unappreciated...this book is for you.... Great practical Christian teaching on following your own destiny, being the authentic you and trusting God to bring the people to you that are suportive and the rest, well....like Joyce Meyer implies, and the old words of wisdom state ""You can't please all the people, all the time."""
3,Not in the greatest condition,This product was not in as good of a condition as i thought it would be. Pages were bent and the cover was almost torn in one spot. My boyfriend still loved it but i think that it was not kept in the greatest ocndition
5,Paul's Been There,"A very nice piece of work from someone who clearly knows what he's writing about. He tells an amazing story of his family, and how his two younger brothers made good. A father from Hell, a long-suffering mother, three abused children. Not only is it a testament to the brothers' strength of character that they managed to survive, it gives the credit where it'sdue--to an inspiring mother who triumphed over the odds against her and nurtured genius."
5,FORS KIDS AND ADULTS,I IDI NOT READ THIS BOOK IT WAS A GIFT.I GLANCED AT AND FOUND THE BOOK REALLY INTERESTING GOOD FOR ALL
2,Not Exactly A Classic,"I can't begin to tell you how bad this book was for me...but I guess I'll try. The Believers' Church is a history book on the character of radical protestantism. And if that subtitle doesn't put you to sleep, then the first 20 pages will surely accomplish that.Durnbaugh wants to inform his readers about how the protestant church came about and the branches thereof. John Yoder calls this book, ""A classic"" and I guess I would agree with him if by classic he means a book that is not enjoyable to read.This book is divided into 3 parts: The Concept of the Believers' Church, The History of the Believers' Church, and The Character of the Believers' Church.The last part would have to be the most enjoyable for me (and that really isn't saying a lot). In The Character of the Believers' Church, Durnbaugh dives into Mission, Evangelism, Church & State and other areas of minor interest.The rest of the book is an entire bore."
3,Weak Feats,Sound qulity is thin and weak especially in the bass. Look for a remastered version if one is available and pass on this one.
2,Save your money,"The only reason to buy this- a cheap way to get the studio version of ""Mexicali Blues."" That's all I have to say."
2,A bunch of no-good hippies that got lucky,"In my expert view, these stoners simply got lucky. I mean, how else do you explain their legion of fanatic fans, or the fact that they even got signed to a major label at all? Truth be told, these guys are a bunch of Bob Dylan wannabees with long hair. Grateful Dead tried to be Bob Dylan by turning up the amps, growing out their hair, and smoking dope. Trouble is, they lack the poignancy of Dylan's beautiful poetry, plus Dylan's political sense of the world. These guys were only out to get stoned, while Dylan was intent on changing the world with his music - and he probably did!!I'll admit there's some jamming electric guitar on some of these songs, but it's nothing that heavy-metal icon Van Halen weren't doing much better ten years later!!Oh well, Halen is still thriving at least. When is their next album coming out?? I heard Roth is back in the fold."
4,Worth It,"I have naturally curly hair so I need a decent flat iron that gets hot. I own a Chi and it works fine. I bought this one to take to Europe because my Chi was not dual-voltage. On previous trips to Europe, my flat irons never seem to get as hot as the ones we use in the states. For the money, I think this flat iron was a good investment for someone with curly, but not kinky, hair."
1,1980's botched remaster of a unbridled classic,"If you've not heard about the ""remaster"" that was done on this release consider this your heads up.At sometime in the 1980s/90's they remixed this album with way too much echo and fake drum machines. Gone is the beautiful rawness and classic mix that defined this album. What you now get is a sound that resembles a bad soundcheck in a tin room. I can see why this was done, it was an attempt to get the Elminator/Afterburner fans to buy the early discs. One review on the ""Best of ZZ Top"" early greatist hits package, said he felt these remasters have destroyed the whole original vibe of the music making it almost unlistenable. I gotta agree with him. Why can't an import at the very least be issued of the original mix? I would gladly cough up 20 to 25 bucks to have this and the other early albums in the way they were meant to sound.So be wary of this CD. This release is not the album you remember."
5,FTIR!,"Very good book on the fundamentals, even though it is the older edition. It is a good reference to start with.I would recommend this for anyone wanting to understand the physics behind FTIR."
3,Best Anthology of Southern Writing in a While,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading these entertaining tales. Too many times, authors in these kinds of anthologies feel as if they have to push the cultural envelope--weird characters, dumb situations. How refreshing that the authors in Inkplots just wanted to tell some good stories. I look forward to seeing many of these names in print again!"
2,Very old; refers to Pascal; uses obscure notation,"I've taken only one course in programming (C++) and was hoping this book would provide me with a better understanding of algorithms. My biggest problem with this book is that they use their own notation based on older programming languages (such as Pascal) - I had a hard time moving from a C++ way of thinking to figuring out how they were expressing the same thing. It didn't work for me because of this... This book looks as if its over 25 years old and is very British. It has some odd English colloquialisms and is written for an English audience. I really don't think - in an object-oriented world, I could recommend this book - if you tried to move to C++ from this, you'd be very confused."
1,"The hinges are on crooked, and the foam is shedding a dust all over my harmonicas","The hinges are on crooked, the foam is leaving a dust all over and inside my harmonicas, very, very dissapointed. Return policy states if I had bought it with a gift card< I cannot return it again."
3,"fun, but not as fun as I thought it would be","I bought this for my almost 4 yr old and her 2 1/2 yr old sister. Both of them are able to play, though my 2 1/2 yr old has trouble understanding that you have to stay off the mat while playing. So far, the girls have enjoyed it, but they aren't as interested in it as I thought they would be. A downside or a need for improvement is that on some of the games, if they step on the correct animal, shape, etc., it does not reinforce it by verbally saying anything (such as ""good job, you stepped on the monkey""). Despite this, I would buy it again."
1,Bad Playmat,"My son did not enjoy this toy, the speaker volume was too low and the voice was boring and there was virtually no music to it. I liked the way it looked, and to it's credit it was sensitive to touch, but it just wasn't fun. I thought the sounds of the animals could be better and louder. This item was returned."
3,A Timely Clarification,"This series of reviews has addressed the issue of the use of the N-word as well as the wearing of blackface in this 1936 Wodehouse classic. To be clear, the N-word certainly had negative connotations, even in the England of the 1930's. The upper classes, of course, saw nothing offensive in using demeaning terminology to describe inferior peoples, and for Wodehouse and his peers, Blacks were about as inferior as people got. In an unrelated short story (not in this volume) Wodehouse writes of an adventurous Englishwoman who would not marry a man she found enticing because he was ""black as the ace of spades."" It was a laugh line whose humor depended on your acceptance that such an interracial union was absolutely beyond serious consideration.You can view this as offensive or just the way folks like Wodehouse saw things in 1936. But please don't claim that it is not horrifically disparaging to people of African ancestry."
4,Witty and Informative,"This work demonstrates that scientists are people too! Solymar and Walsh offer a survey of a difficult subject in a manner that is easy to follow, and sometimes funny. The quantum mechanics of electronics are explained in sufficient depth to be useful, but not overdone enough to be boring. I especially loved the section on superconductivity! The book offer may not be the most in-depth on individual subjects, but it presents each subject in a clear, understandable way. Wonderful for the student."
2,Top layer of plastic peeled off,"I purchased this pastry mat at Bed, Bath, and Beyond a few years ago. The top layer of plastic peeled up in spots. I don't like plastic bits in my food, so I no longer use this mat."
1,Will not lay flat - see my recommendation,I purchased this pastry mat from another retailer. It will not lay flat. Take a good look at the product picture. See how the corners are curling. It helps to wet the counter first and then put something on each corner to weight it down so the corners will not curl.I eventually tired of the games and purchased the Conimar Kitchen Helper Pastry Mat - sold by Amazon. The Conimar is a much better pastry mat and will lay flat without the games. It comes with a handy storage tube.
4,The kids love it,"I ordered this toy for my nephew. Even though he does not quite have walking mastered, he loves to just push this toy around! It is an upgraded version of the ""popper"" that I had as a kid!"
3,Honest_Reviewer,"Movie okay. You can watch it on youtube or somewhere else online, so I would save some money and not bother buying it. But since I did buy it without knowing you can watch it for free, I can say that this movie is family friendly and interesting. Good for thanksgiving. We are Christians and there is just one part that bothered me personally. It is when the girl was talking to the statue and in the movie they portrayed it like she was praying to it. At least thats how it came across to me. Anyhow, its not such a big deal and the movie has some good values."
5,As good as Rock Blues gets!,"If you were wondering where ZZ Top got their inspiration, look no further than Deguello. In addition to the hits everyone knows, (I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide and Cheap Sunglasses) there are some really great blues tunes on this CD. She Loves My Automobile and Dust My Broom are both fabulous. This is my candidate for the best ZZ Top album, in spite of the quality of Eliminator and Afterburner. Bluesy, but with that ZZ Top drive we know and love!"
4,last good album,deguello is the texas trios last good album.saw them live at the waterbury palace theatre after it came out excellent show. the best i ever saw them.unfortunatly the albums after this one were awful mtv turned them into cartoon characters what a waste.
4,No need to re-master this album,"Much has been written about the re-mastering of earlier ZZ Top titles, with mostly negative comments. This release, fortunately, still holds up well in its original form for good reason. It was one of the BEST quality recordings on vinyl in 1979, and is on par with Ry Cooder's ""Bop Till You Drop"" LP, also released by Warner the same year; and that was the FIRST commercial digital recording!"
5,The coolest music you can get,"""Deguello"" is definitely the peak in the career of ZZ Top. Every record that followed this one got more and more commercial and thus it got worse. If there's any record by any band that I can label as being ""cool"" it's this one. The playing is wonderful, the lyrics tongue-in-cheek and the vocals are perfectly suited to the music. Every song is a gem (although I had some doubts about ""Manic Mechanic"") and together they're unbeatable. It's just great ! Get the car, put on this cd and flash your gold tooth display !Hans Wigman."
1,$1.50 + tax for this?!,"I thought I would get a digital copy of the ""Gale Encyclopedia of Alternative Medicine"" by Bonnie Prudden. Instead I got a few inane paragraphs about Bonnie Prudden that don't hold a candle to Wikipedia's free entry on her. A total waste."
4,"Interesting insight, and fresh ""views"" of the breast.","Perhaps not quite what we expected. We (my girlfriend and I) are both interested in what roles the breast plays in sociology and in culture, and hoped this book would grant us some fresh perspectives.There are very interesting and provocative (but I certainly wouldnt call them erotic by any means) images in this book, as well as some fascinating art. Some of it we really would love to have framed.The images are suitable for anyone to look at, with only a few being tantalizing or vaguely... scintillating. It's the kind of book that is good to read sitting down with company and see how you and others react. Perfectly suitable for a bookshelf or coffeetable."
3,Intense Industrial Metal,"This release by Puncture takes no prisoners. Raw, aggressive & mechanical is the best way to describe this album. All tracks have a certain menacing tone to them that makes you want to move in a violent way. Certainly not groundbreaking but not some clone either. If you like your metal full of samples & drum machines then Puncture is the way to go!"
1,Arrived broken ... twice,"This is a great easel at a good price. Solid and sturdy. Used them extensively in the military in the field and on deployments. I would have given it 4-1/2 stars. However, the supplier is very careless about shipping this item. The easel arrived poorly boxed and was broken. Returned for a replacement, and arrived again broken, same type of packaging. Returned for a refund. Amazon has been very good about returns. Do not buy from this supplier. I will go to an office supply store, even though I will end up paying a little more."
4,Good product.,"Excellent price, good product, easy care. Works well in the office and stands up to the wear and tear it gets."
2,Beautiful faucet - While it lasted,"Received this beautiful faucet in a timely manner and it apparently operated well, but over time, it began to fail. After only 2 years, we've had to tighten the handles often, and just today, had to replace the washers because of leakiness. Not just a simple, annoying drip, but a full-on trickle that began this morning. 2 years was a short time for the cost. Replacing it now and not buying that brand ever."
5,Don't forget the staples...,"Don't forget the staples... you're gonna need them. Excellent for hanging lights and garland during the seasons. Comfortable grip and they've made it easy to position over the light cord. My lights look great and they'll look great next year too, great tool."
4,This book gave me the Courage to Continue breastfeeding,"I am the mother of a 17-month-old child who loves to nurse and was feeling obligated to wean him because of what others might think of an older child still nursing. This book gave me the courage to follow my natural insticts and let my child decide when to be weaned. This book gave reasons why continued breastfeeding is beneficial to older children as well as younger and also helped me see that I am a good mother. This book is an excellent tool for any breastfeeding mother who cherishes the bonding time breastfeeding provides.After reading this book I was told I would need to wean my child to have a medical procedure. The book gave my the courage to say no. Later it was realized that the certain medical procedure would have been unneccessay. I am so grateful I took the time to read this book, I know it can give you the courage to continue also."
3,Breastfeeding,"I thought this book was just okay. I felt like she just kept saying the same thing over and over again. That keeping the baby close to mom is the best way to care for baby and by breastfeeding on demand you can expect a delay in the return of ovulation. I was disappointed that there really was no assistance given for mom's who go back to work. I would like to know statistics on how pumping and breastfeeding affect the return of fertility, but her point was to never give baby a bottle. I'm past the 3 month phase and have been back to work about 4 weeks with still no return. But it really comes down to the fact that everyone's body's are different so just because it works that way for one person doesn't mean it will be the same for another."
4,"""Toilet seat blue...""","...was the way I think Ry described his Fender's finish in an old Guitar Player interview. Part of Cooder's genius was/is arranging electric and acoustic instruments in a way that's satisfying to fans of both. Granted, ""Bop"" is not a blues record and neither is the music it reinterprets. Still, Ry's open D and G comping is a pleasure to hear and learn from. But, for a guy whose prior records just ""sounded"" so terrific, the digital production sheen on this one was a disappointment at the time and, while fun to hear again after so long, for my taste, ""Bop"" can't quite take its place among his best."
1,never worked,"I bought this toy for Christmas for my 3 year old daughter. After putting in ALL the batteries it neeeded, it never even worked. Its to big a hassle to return it since I got it on clearance. Next time I'll listen to other reviews."
3,Should have been better,"Tenchu was without a doubt my favorite ps1 game. I played it too death and loved to reply it again and again. I was really looking forward to Tenchu 2. But after playing it I just didn't think it was a worthy sequal. I still enjoyed playing it. Some of the missions were very interesting, while others were not so. The graphics were poor at times. But the POV was terrible. Many times it ended in werid angles where I couldn't see the person attacking me. Worse when it was a boss. It is still a good fun game. With codes readily available and easy to do. It gives it that bit extra if you just can't beat a certain boss. Overall it just isn't as good as it should have been. I hope they do a Tenchu 3 for the PS2."
3,Bad Controls/Bad Visuals mar good game,"The original Tenchu game was fantastically fun and I had high expectations for the sequel. While basically a good game, the sequel is badly marred by a couple of flaws.First, there a great deal of ""break through"" in the 3D graphics. Buildings don't fade in and out of the fog, they disappear and re appear suddenly(unrealistic and distracting) despite an absolute clear backdrop. In addition, seams between supposedly solid objects open and close as your view shifts.Secondly, the controls scheme is not as responsive as the first game. This makes sneaking up on opponents frustrating and fighting bad guys outright fatal.Unfortunately, these two flaws make a potentially great game only good."
5,A soon to be Classic!,"I was blown away when i first started playing. New moves, new weapons, a whole lot more variety when it comes ot stealtn fatalities. The graphics are very good, and the enemies are creative and quite entertaining. If you like violence then this is for you. More blood, and death then ever. If you liked Tenchu, then you will surely be astonished by what Tenchu 2 has to ofter. In my mind tha greates game in it's genre."
4,The story of a teen ninja,"Tenchu 2: Birth of the stealth assassin - Circa 1999GOOD:- Easy and fun stealth gameplay- nice/tight controls- Custom mission mode, make your own missionsBAD:- Really dated graphics- Stealth gameplay can be overly simple- Little replay value with not much to unlockWILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:- The game is a prequel to Tenchu: Stealth assassin but plays the exact same way- Ancient Japanese samurai and swords theme- Ninja Stealth gameplay, more fun hack and slash then overly complex (think more Metal Gear then Splinter Cell)- Three playable characters two male and one femaleGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Tenchu: Stealth assassin- Metal Gear Solid- Siphon FilterADDITIONAL NOTES:- Even though this is the second Tenchu game it's the first Tenchu game in terms of story- The games custom mission mode comes with some built in custom missions from the Japanese version"
3,Not as good as the first,"Tenchu 2 doesn't really hold a candle to it's predecessor. Theproblems that existed in the 1st ... are back and worse than before. On the plus side, it offers some new features like hiding the corpses of your slain enemies, new moves, new weapons and a mission editor(which pretty ... cool!) If you can look past the problems, tenchu 2 provides hours of slash em' up,lob it off fun for the whole family."
1,carter makes no sense,"Ex president Carter makes no sense in this interview. Lou Dobbs is boring, the questions are soft, and the entire presentation is weak"
4,"Another good Van album, but...","I think that there are ultimately two types of Van Morrison fans - those who prefer Astral Weeks and those who prefer Moondance. I think both are great, but I give the edge to Moondance; I can appreciate the arguments for Astral Weeks, but it's completely a matter of taste. If you like Van Morrison, you're all right in my book. Veedon Fleece is definitely more like Astral Weeks - contemplative, the whole almbum conveying a mood more than an importance on individual songs. I really love the albums Into the Music and His Band and Street Choir. But if you prefer Astral Weeks, Veedon Fleece in many ways is a continuation of that. Still very good."
5,Sheer magnificence! It doesn't get any better than this....,"Although certainly a very large statement given Van's incredible body of work, this could- in my opinion, very well be his finest moment. The sheer power and beauty of his vocals is sonic perfection to these ears. The instrumentation is wonderful and the songs rank among his best. Get it, now! You certainly won't regret it! I personally recommend the Japanese mini-lp version, played loudly and often. You Don't Pull No Punches- Indeed!!"
5,For You!!!,"I couldn't be happier with the purchase of this CD. The price, quality, and the speed in which it came all were exceptional. I will be buying more from this site soon!"
3,This was a good starting point for the Artist!!!,"Although this was a good starting point for him, I gave him 3 stars, because of what we now know of his skills. Prince wasn't as free musically then as he is now. We need to consider that. This was a new thing for the 70's. This was a new sound out of Milwaukke(hope I spelled it right) that people were getting a whiff of. Prince may not have been so dynamic on this album, but it IS his essence that flows through each song. I may not have like the album fully, but it is the Prince we love that sings each note."
4,stunning,"someone recording a debut like this should be looked at as someone who has a supernatural talent, and it's no surprise that he is and was capable of something like this. but at this age-doing everything himself this good-wow!. from the acapella intricacies of the title track to the stellar arrangements in 'my love is forever' to the fairly sweet sentiments on lyrical display, aforeshadow of what's 2 come. yes, it sounds a bit lukewarm at times (the funk could have been souped up on 'soft and wet'), but it actually sounds a bit more diverse than subsequent releases, if only for the presence of two acoustic-based tracks (crazy you and so blue). he's showing us all his talent and his possibilities here. 'dirty mind' is the one to hear if u need a primer on what makes the prince we know so...dirty, but this is a worthy album nonetheless. and damn is that falsetto high!"
3,Disappointed,What a disappointed! I have waited for years to get an album of the Smothers Brothers playing it straight. Their fantastic harmony and Tommy's virtuoso guitar playing has always made me want more. What did I get? An orchestra and a sorry collection of songs. It just isn't the Smothers Brothers that I know and love.
2,MOSBY: Read This!,"Ok, Ferri is great and all. Best medical handbook out there, with the possible exception of Oxford Handbook of Clin Med.But, BUT, can SOMEONE please get it through to the publisher that a spiral bound book of this size is a BAD IDEA??The book is 1200 pages long, HELLO??Don't you guys do any product testing? This is a medical handbook used by residents and interns. It WILL get banged up. We don't need pages coming loose and dropping out of our books. Why isn't anyone at Mosby listening, this has been a criticism for years..."
4,easy read,This book puts Autism Spectrum Disorders into words that anyone can understand. It is concrete and accurate. Very good.
5,Just diagnosed? Read this book!,"When we first learned our twins were both on the Autism Spectrum, I needed more information and direction to immediate resources. This book has both and so much more from a PARENT's prespective. I found it helpful, empowering, and realistic for moms like me reeling from the initial shock. I'm so glad I bought it, read it and have it on my shelf as a reference guide!"
3,Advertising Oddity,"I ordered one of these items this morning. At the time, the company listed 2 in stock (so ""order now""). This afternoon, they list 3 in stock. Strange coincidence."
1,not happy,"Got this Godzilla for my son's birthday. I have to agree with some other reviewers that the Godzilla I got is not the same has pictured. Plus I had noticed right away just out of the box, several of the seams on this Godzilla were open and stuffing coming out. This plush toy was very poorly put together and in my opinion not safe for younger children. I was able to fix Godzilla but for the money I paid for him I should not have had to."
1,"Rubbish, then and now.","The Sex Pistols were a manufactured band, just like The Monkees. How sad that so many people fell for it. Rotten (Lydon) himself said at the first and last US gig ""Don't you people even know when you're being had?"" At least The Monkees had talent. This was all attitude and theater not music. This crap has simply not become part of the cultural landscape because it lacks that esssential pre-requisite; talent. These no-talent yobs were merely an invention of their Svengali puppet-master Malcolm McLaren."
3,"Politics aside, this album has some great tunes","Yes, we all know that the Pistols were just a money making scheme and were all about image more so than music, but you can't deny the power of a good song. And this album has it's fair share of good songs. My personal faves are: New York, Holiday in the Sun, Bodies, No Feelings, and God Save the Queen"
3,"overrated, but still a good album","i don't know why so many people refer to this as the greatest punk album of all time. the sex pistols were by no means a great band, but their influence is more impressive than they were. this album is a testament to bad taste, and when it works, it's nothing less than stunning. unfortunately, those moments are not very many.to start with, there are basically five great songs on, 'never mind the bollocks.' 'holiday in the sun,' 'bodies,' 'god save the queen,' 'anarchy in the uk,' and, 'pretty vacant.' for these songs it is worth to buy the cd. but then there is a very large downside; this album has way too much filler. almost all the songs besides the five mentioned are bloody awful, with poor drumming, muddled singing, and boring guitars. the ideas are revolutionary, but the actual music is weak and pointless.so go ahead. buy the album, but besides the few terrific songs, prepare to be disappointed. i suggest listening to the ramones instead."
1,Sex Pistols are horrible. Save your money,"Alright, I used to be a huge fan of the Sex Pistols then I realized that there were WAY better bands out there then them. Sid Vicious was nothing but a coat on a hanger (only there for publicity purposes) and I don't understand how girls can find him attractive all he was, was a heroin addict who cut himself on stage (Yes Iggy Pop did this too but at least he was good and is an artist) he also ended up killing his girlfriend. He couldn't even play the bass!! Not to mention that horrible T-shirt with the swastika he used to wear and for what reason other than to make people mad and get attention. Johnny ""Rotten"" is just jerk off. If you want ""Political"" punk then save your money and get some Sham 69 maybe even some Crass, but then again there's only so much screaming one can take"
5,Only one?,"Yes, the one and only studio album from the pistols. It is brilliant and should be a part of punk rock school 101 for little indie kids who still haven't heard. In terms of power chord rock and roll, this is a kind of throwback to the old days but the spirit is very punk and very british. Speed punk does not apply here. This is pure."
5,Essential CD for punk lovers,"The Pistols WERE the punk movement (even though there is some dispute as to whether the punk movement started in NYC or the UK). Doesn't matter -- what does matter is that it churned out some of the best, most interesting and most missunderstood music ever. I love this album. I keep it in the car at all times and crank it loud when I'm [upset] about something (which in L.A., means pretty much every time I drive since everyone here drives like an idiot). In short, if you don't have this, GET IT."
5,We need more of this..,"This is (in my opinion) the best punk album ever released, and by the best punk band (in my opinion) of all time. Unfortunatly there is less and less of this music going on today, I hope for more influential punk bands to stir up anarchy like the sex pistols did..because right now we've got whining pop-rock bands, or you can listen to rap music, which dumbs down society."
5,What???,I cant belive people who put bad reveiws they must like rap. This is top three along with rammones and clash. If you like punk rock then you have to own this. Oh and to the guy who said the biggest joke to rock and roll you are the biggest idiot I have ever seen as far as im concerned this is the best thing that has ever happened to rock and roll so shut your mouth.
3,Good to bang your head to... for a while.,"I don't deny that this is deffinantly an influential album, and its awesome for when you are pumped up or just in the mood for it. It's a solid album all in all, and if you're looking for balls to the wall punk, then I'd say this is a 5 star CD. However, I though musicly a lot of the songs were very similar, and eventually just get to be an annoying ringing in your head, which is why I docked it two stars. (but really, stars are givin away way to sparingly, three stars means AVARAGE, but whenever anyone sees it now, they think it means bad.)"
4,Bonnie's first (almost) big hit album.,"When this was released in 1977, it looked as if the mainstream was about to catch up with the incredible music machine named Bonnie Raitt. Alas, they would have to wait another 12 years until the release of Nick of Time. This one has it all, however. Containing some of Bonnie's most rocking numbers (Gamblin' Man and Three Time Loser) to her most mellow and introspective (Paul Siebel's classic ""Louise"" and her take on Jackson Browne's ""Farewell"", Sweet Forgiveness is one of the best of the early Raitt repetoire."
4,Not my favorite Prince album but...,"It's worth the price for ""The Question of U"" which is an unknown Prince song (check out the song sample). And I am totally in love with The Time's ""Love Machine."" The Time rocks, and so does Elisa (the girl they are singing with!)"
4,Take It 2 The Bridge.............,"I think this album would have worked better if they realeased one disc for all Prince songs, and the other disc for the varias other artists. I love all the Prince tracks, and ""Round and Round"", and ""Shake"" are the other standouts for me. But it's a mixed bag when u just wanna hear Prince and u gotta skip tracks just 2 b in the Prince vibe. There are alot of classic Prince songs on here including ""Can't Stop This Feelin' I Got"", ""We Can Funk"" (The bootleg is better, in my oppinion), ""Elephants and Flowers"", ""The Question of U"", ""Joy In Repetition"", of course ""Thieves In The Temple"", and the high school musical type number ""Graffiti Bridge"". This is still a classic Prince album and the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of discombobulated track arrangement with the other non-Prince songs."
4,A standout effort and one of Prince's better albums,"This album contains some great Prince songs: ""Joy In Repetition"" (a brilliant cut), ""New Power Generation,"" ""Thieves in the Temple,"" ""The Question of U,"" and the beautiful ""Still Would Stand All Time."" It's an essential for Prince fans and a worthy addition to any collection."
3,Just Another Predictable Mystery!,"This book had a good plot but it was very slow. The ending was so predictable. I felt the author needed to spend more time making this novel more suspenseful. I was impressed with the author's knowledge of the the courtroom though. If I were you, I would spend my money on a book that that more action and suspense."
1,"A Good story,but poorly written.","Let me preface my review by saying that I read the whole book and was really interested to see how it ended. However, I was annoyed the entire time I read this book. Jess, the main character, is a pyschologist? She is a nuerotic mess who is bullied by everyone in her life, including her three rotton children. Her teenage daughter tells her that her brother molested her, and she just brushes it off as normal behavior? I could go on and on.Some plot points were so ridiculous I couldn't believe they were on paper. Deloros gets caught giving false testimony to a detective and then physically attacks him THREE timesand he sends her on her way.The same veteran detective lets a rent-a-cop security guard put a gun to his head and threaten to kill him and also sends him on his way. terrible dialogue.This is the 1st and last book i will read by the author."
2,Ehhh..it's okay,"I have been doing barre workouts for about two years now including P57, Purre Barre, Tracey Mallet, and others. The intensity of this DVD is nothing in comparison to the workouts I just mentioned.I like variation of some of the moves (the chair work was somewhat different from what I'm used to) but the mat work was horrible. Not enough support for the low back and no variations on moves. I felt like I had wasted the last 20 min or so of the workout doing useless moves for my core.I do like the emphasis on posture and form, however, as this is where many barre workouts are lacking. Sam gives great instruction and isn't (too) annoying. In sum, it will be added to my rotation but could never be my primary workout."
3,It's okay.,"This was my first ever barre DVD and I have to say that it's just okay. There's no real instruction or variation to this DVD. I don't like the instructor. She's yelling at her maximum level and she's not very pleasant to listen to. She's using so much effort yelling that she turns red and she's out of breath and she never fully does any of the moves. The whole DVD is pretty tacky. The only reason I even felt anything is because I watched other barre videos and I knew what to expect. Other than that, it's not a very good DVD. I didn't really work out my legs that much at all. Save your money. There are better DVDs out there."
2,A lot of fuss o'er nothing,"I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about regarding this (and most other Nelly) albums. Maybe I'm a bit old-fashioned and out of tune with the present youngsters and their tastes. Either that, or they're a bunch of jaded wimps to rate an album like this as No.1. Absolutely insipid, without character and beat, no verve to entrance and no melody to enchant. Give me Madonna and Celine Dion any day - I will even make do with Beyonce."
3,Way Too Textbookey,"I wish I could have enjoyed this book better. I read it on the heels of another recently published book on ballet. This book is just way too much of a hash of information with footnotes: a bit of information here, a bit there. And not much depth to the analysis. I felt as if I was back in college and I had to read it. Too bad."
3,Good book but too detailed,It is a good book but it goes into too much detail about things. I would recommend for woman who need to understand how their body works.
4,The Red Hat Club,"I just loved this book and the characters. A nice easy read that made me smile. I miss them now I've finished and wonder what they'd be up to next, just like old friends."
1,Gabberflasted.,The characters in this book seem more like children than grown women. they govern their friendships with child like rules and have cutsy little names like Su Su. and Brad just an awlful book. Heywood uses baby terms like gabberflasted. I was just bored with the whole predictable story line.
2,Beat up,"The book came used, which to them meant beat up and pages ripped. Not gently used, but very used. Not worth it at all."
4,If We Could All Have Friends Like This,"Great book, should be the bible for female friendships. This book is cute, well written, and entertaining. I am trying to get all of my friends to read it to learn how friendships last."
2,This Southern woman is disappointed....,"After so eagerly awaiting the release of this book it was a dull, slow, predictable read. What a waste of time. I have never rated a book in this forum, but I felt this worthy of a big thumbs down!The Red Hat Club portrays we southern women as clickish, shallow, conniving women. WRONG!!!"
1,Stick with Brian De Palma's version.,"Boy, does Scarface stink. It's badly acted, with inept direction from Howard Hawks, and features a musical score more fit for a comedy. That so-called ""car chase"" is laughably choreographed. Just watch the Brian De Palma/Al Pacino version for a true intense and epic look at the rise and downfall of a criminal."
1,"Highly fictionalized memoir, not even very good spy story","""However, none of these authors could match Aline, the Countess of Romanones, who, between 1987 and 1994 published four books, The Spy Wore Red, The Spy Went Dancing, The Spy Wore Silk, and The Well-Mannered Spy, recording her involvement with espionage, beginning with Operation BULLFIGHT in Spain at the end of 1943. Although Alines (sic) had served as a cipher clerk in Madrid for the Office of Strategic Services, her supposedly factual accounts were completely fictional. ""(West, Nigel. Historical Dictionary of Sexpionage. Scarecrow Press. 2009.)"
3,Disappointed,"I'm a Stonewall Jackson fan, but can't find his true blue music anywhere. Why doesn't someone release some of his ole originals. Old Showboat is greatly missed."
5,Wow Great Mini Series,This was a great story. Very creep y especially those evil rats eeek!!!! I hate rats. Very nice story and The ending to the thisrd one was great I was so happy about the ending. I loved Goosebumnps I have just started Reading the Fear Street Books and so far I think they are great. I believe these books can be for older peopel to. Becuase these books were creepy. how can a 9 year old kid see peopels heads being ripped off in a story I don't see how but they do so great Series I intendo to buy some more of the Fear streets any reccomendations from anyone on here on whats another good fears treet to get.
2,I got this for my wife to use ...,"I got this for my wife to use and she was less than pleased with the product. The conditioner didn't leave her hair feeling any better; in fact; she thought it actually made her hair more dry and frizzy. Thinking it may be a reaction with the shampoo she was using, she even switched shampoo and didn't get the results she was expecting from this conditioner. I don't think this product lives up to its advertising claims, and we won't be purchasing it in our household."
5,Love This!,I got this puppet for my daughter for Christmas and loved it so much I bought another one for my niece!
2,Disappointing,"The voice is distracting, which is important in something you have to listen to in order to appreciate. The lessons are not separated into easy sections either."
4,THIS IS MY FAVORITE,DIOR IS A WONDERFUL HOUSE OF LUXURIES .MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCE FOE A DESCENT PRICE .PERFUMES AND COLOGNES PRICES CONTINUE TO RISEBUT AMAZON CHARGES A FAIR PRICE FOR THIS PRODUCT111
1,dissapointed,"I bought this thinking it was lethal poison, my wife has been nagging me a lot, and it's getting really annoying. I started putting it in her drinks and food, she said that it tasted funny (which is good, because i thought it was working), and then continued to nag me about my cooking. Although, she continued to eat my poisoned meals. Sadly, this product did not work, and my wife continues to nag me a lot, this product DOES NOT WORK. I will in the future be buying my women poisoning products else where."
4,"Excellent, Excellent Sound....But Where's The Rest?","The sound quality here is excellent. Much truer to the original ZZ Top vibe than the bastardized version presented on ""Six Pack"". No ZZ Top fan will be disappointed in this purchase. My only beef is the live part of the album. With the expanded cd format, why not give us the rest of the live show (ala The Who ""Live At Leeds"" or Skynyrd's ""One More From The Road"")? I own this cd, and if you're a ZZ Top fan you should too. But as a diehard fan, I'm still holding out for the complete concert. BTW, search zShops for the best price."
3,Lost Brilliance,"This silver and emerald resin swirl ring is a nice conversation piece. When held up in the light, the emerald green resin is a rich and vibrant hue. However, the richness of the color is only enhanced when caught by the rays of light. Unfortunately, once the ring is placed on your finger, the clear-see-thru green color becomes a dark green more akin to jade and immedietly looses it's brilliance and clarity.The ring will always look nice, but don't expect the color you see in the photo unless your holding it up to the light."
4,Soulful and heartfelt,"The Afghan Whigs do some amazing covers, which is evident in their version of Radiohead's ""Creep"". This EP is worth it if only just for that."
4,Love this music,My young children and I listen to this in the car. We all like it. I only rated it a four because I am darn tired of Puff which is on all children's music collections.
2,Disappointed,"A little deceptive. The ad reads 1000 per case so I thought it to be a big case of covers at a great price. Instead, I received four packs of toilet seat covers. Next time, I'll go to Smart and Final and purchase toilet seat covers at the same price and I don't have to pay shipping costs."
5,Danny Dunn and the Anti-Gravity Paint,Arrived quickly and is in great shape especially for the age of the book which I think is out of print. Thanks!
1,Change title to Not A Hero At All,"Beware, you'll be filling her pockets while she puts the religious spin on everything. She's obviously a messed up lady and unfortunately, this will be her claim to fame and fortune only because she was in the wrong place at the wrong time. She is no hero, but a drug addict who has said on TV that she's clean now because God told her not to do drugs anymore. She speaks to God too."
4,"Pretty good, but not great writing.","I guess I didn't know much about the whole ordeal. I mean, I remember watching the ""surrender"" unfold on TV and hearing about the single mom, blah, blah, blah, but I didn't know too much. I think that is what made it such a page turner for me.This book is really good in the aspect of thinking about what you would do in this situation. As for Ashley, it states in the beginning of the book that the conversations are just what she remembers and it's not word-for-word. In reading this statement and then her story, I have to wonder how much of it she actually ""remembered"" and how much she made up. It just seemed a little too good to be true. I'm not calling her a liar, I'm just saying I'm not convinced. Don't get me wrong, it is a good book and she was very brave (you would have to be to be able to make it out alive,) but I just didn't come away from it feeling ""inspired."""
3,Decent book but unflattering details left out,"This is a decent book, but it leaves out some key details, namely the recently-disclosed fact that the killer told Ashley Smith that he wanted some marijuana, and she didn't have any marijuana in her possession but she did have some crystal meth in her possession, so she gave him some of her crystal meth. Those kinds of details do make it less of a fairy tale and less flattering towards the author, but Ashley Smith is still a heroic woman whose actions may have prevented more people from being killed by that man. Decent book... but you should go into it knowing that certain details are going to be left out."
3,Unlikely Story,The book reads more like a bad movie script. The story seems rehearsed instead of real. It's possible that the events happened the way that they are written. It just seems unlikely. I found it extremely difficult to believe that alleged murderer waited in the parking lot while she went to purchase cigarettes.
3,Decent book about Harlem Globetrotters,"This is one of a number of books written about the Harlem Globetrotters basketball them. However, it came out in the early 1970's, so there's nothing about the near-bankruptcy of the Trotters in the 1990's, nor their rescue by former player Mannie Jackson (who has since sold the team). If you're looking for a general history of the team, this is not a bad one to pick up (and it's usually very affordable), but don't expect much in-depth analysis. George Vecsey is a decent writer, but this one doesn't rate as one of his best efforts. He gives the standard story of how the Trotters began and writes about how they grew and developed stars over the years, but it's not terribly deep.The best book on the team is ""Spinning the Globe"" by Ben Green, which is by far the most accurate history of the Globetrotters ever written. If you REALLY want to know the Globetrotters story, get that one instead."
1,T-shirt review,"First of all, this is NOT heavyweight. It looks like a man's underwear shirt. It comes out of the dryer like a washed and dried Kleenex. I will use these for rags."
1,Labels won't stick to the shiny material!,"These are the worst mailers I've ever purchased from Amazon. They were $2.00 a pack cheaper than the other ones I usually purchase on Amazon, and boy, the ""cheap comes out expensive."" Our printed labels absolutely would not stick to these and practically fell off and had to be taped on to keep them from being removed just by touching the label. The material is ""shiny"" compared to the matte finish you usually find on these bags, which I suspect is the reason the labels won't stick. Returned 300 of them and purchased the ones that were more expensive. AVOID THESE"
1,Horrible quality,"I purchased the bags to mail a t-shirt. The mailer bags seemed flimsy when I opened the package, and the bag barely holds one shirt. Concerned about how flimsy they seemed, I slid into the bag a light-weight cardboard backing. The cardboard poked holes in the bag material. After seeing the holes, I tried pressing my fingernail through the bag and it went right through. I can't imagine what would have happened to the shirt as it went through post office machinery if I'd tried mailing it in one of these bags! It could have easily snagged and torn open. The only reason I haven't returned them is it isn't worth the postage to return them -- it would be throwing good money after bad. Also, the only reason I gave it one star is you that Amazon won't let you give a product ZERO stars, because ZERO is what I would have selected."
3,Entertaining,"My family came to Texas before Texas was a Republic or a State. Therefore, I have a keen interest in historical fiction of Texas. This book was very entertaining and the author did his homework on the geographical content. If you enjoy historical fiction, you will enjoy this book."
5,Rhino remasters,I just picked up remastered versions of Tres Hombres and Fandango from Rhino and can't wait to listen to them.
2,Disappointed by a mastering error,"My 2-star rating isn't for the material: ZZ Top's seminal work merits 4-5 stars. Nor is it for the mix: the original mix as intended by the artist at the time of recording has indeed been restored. My gripe concerns the remastering. There's an error in ""LaGrange"" at 2:22: in the process of ""cleaning up"" the original master to create a master for CD, about 1/4 second or 1-2 beats of Frank Beard's fill has been deleted. Most may not notice it, but being a drummer and having the song committed to memory, this error sticks out like a sore thumb, and now makes me question the integrity rest of the material, with which (with the exception of Bus/Jesus) I and other most casual fans are probably not quite so familiar. Bottom line: If you're intent is to buy ""LaGrange,"" arguably the song that best defines ZZ Top, get ""Best of ZZ Top"" or a vinyl copy instead and you won't miss a beat."
5,A tres too much echo,"I originally had Tres Hombres on vinyl but when I bought Tres Hombres on CD I discovered much to my dismay that it was a remix. Ugh! I never could get used to it and Tres Hombres went from being one of my favorite albums to a CD I had in my collection that I never listened to. I finally sold that CD a few years back. Some of the original mixes from Tres Hombres were available on the greatest hits and that's what you would normally hear on the radio. Now, someone has come to their senses and made the original, popular mix, available. Buy this, don't buy the remix. This is a classic album. ZZ top weren't as gimicky then and the writing on this album is flawless."
3,Fish not Interested,"I used the orange sucker spawn recently at a trout club. I did land one trout on the orange sucker spawn, but had to throw the fly away as it did not hold up after only one fish. The rest of the day, the orange spawn did not cause any fish to rise, so I used other flies after that. I will save the rest for the next time I can go after steelhead. I would have liked for the fly to be a little more durable."
5,Superb Reissue,Swing era superstars like Red Allen and Benny Carter at the top of their game. The remastering quality is astoundingly good. Highly recommended for anybody interested in '30's jazz. The beauty and joy of music from this era is unsurpassed in my opinion.
5,REBIRTH OF A LEGENDARY SERIES,"Whoever was responsible for selecting the sides for inclusion in Vocalion's original Swing Series deserves a medal, because the quality is such that the label is held in high esteem. And who better to reissue them on CD than the reincarnation of Vocalion, under Mike Dutton. Not only has he done that, but with great attention to detail the cover duplicates the Vocalion 78 sleeve, and the CD face is emblazoned with a blow-up of the original 78 label. All of which merely sets the scene for what's on the CD, which features some of the best bands of the mid-30s (although the last track harks back to the late 20s). Benny Carter is featured on one-third of the tracks, all recorded during his stay in London, when his orchestra comprised some of the best British musicians of the time. This is a superb reissue which is enhanced by the late, great Malcolm Laycock's liner note."
1,Overpriced and tastless,"We bought our daughter the whole set last year for Christmas. Not only was the mixes expensive, they were small portions and tastless. You barely had enough mix the fill the tin and then you could only bake one cookie/cake at a time. Very time consuming. Needless to say, the whole set was sold in a yard sale."
5,"More great sci-fi from the author of ""Ender's Game""","Multiple Hugo and Nebula award winner Orson Scott Card is one of my favorite authors in any genre. He's simply the best at combining fully-fleshed characters, riveting character drama (his handling of family members in conflict sets the standard, imho) and great storytelling. This five-book series (the first 3 are included in this volume) is my favorite series by him, edging out Alvin Maker and both Ender series. Set millions of years in the future, it concerns a loose-knit extended family on the planet Harmony, called out from among their neighbors by the ""Oversoul"" to re-activate the remaining starships and journey back to Earth. Into this epic tale, Card weaves themes of faith, family, loyalty, trust, fidelity and the balance between the needs of the individual vs. society. Card is the only author ever to win both Hugo and Nebula awards back-to-back. This series proves that his talent isn't limited to the Enderverse."
4,cool system for use at work,"this system enables my wife to use her XM at work all day. It powers her xm all day. Unfortunately her cube does not get good reception (hopefully that will change when they move)but she can record here at home and then listen to it at work.We have tested and the reception on this system matches the original, so we assume it is as good as it gets..."
1,Put the good S#$t out!,yeah re-mix sucks but it's still great zz. admit you were wrong and make it right!
5,AMAZING!,"This is the best RK album yet. It is AMAZING! Their cds just keep getting better. I for one am glad that they are maturing. Their songs now have more meaning. I love that there is a Christian Punk band that CAN hold a candle to the secular bands out there like Good Charlotte and such. The music is just great. I fully recommend this disc, even if you've never liked RK. They are the best punk band I've ever heard and to this day are still my favorite band. PERIOD!"
4,Fav CD from Fav Band,"I love this CD...Every single track...I have all of their CD's except for the newest, Forget and Not Slow Down, which hopefully I will be receiving for Christmas, and so far mmhmm is my absolute favorite. I love Relient K. They just put me in such a good mood!!!"
4,Mmhmm...,"at first i was very disappointed at this album. the first 3 were choc-full of catchy tunes and harmonies, but on this cd, there are only 2 songs with the ""classic rk sound"" we've all come to know and love; ""dead horse"" and ""maintain consciousness."" plus, the other 3 had a cool little bonus track at the end of the last song, but no such luck here. other than that, after listening to the cd over and over, i've come to accept that the old rk that we all know and love is gone, but the newe one isnt so bad afterall..."
3,not what I expected,"The movie has little plot and while it is interesting, it just drops off at the end. There is no explanation as to what happens, if anything. Also, the movie frequently fast forwards in time without warning. One minute it's one day, then next minutes it's 6 months later. It was definitely a realist view of long term relationships, which I appreciated. It shows the reality of living apart and how easy it is to move on, and how difficult it is to forget your first love."
3,romance,I thought they loved each other so much . But at the end they never understood each other needs and wants.
2,mumble-core-ish melodramatic trajedy masquerading as a chick flick,"The first 25 minutes are lovely, and you think you chose a great movie to watch with your girlfriend. WRONG! (Should've chosen the zombie movie, most definitely). For the next two hours you watch two very average young people deal with the most unpleasant aspects of a relationship (jealousy, distance, etc) and attempt to execute the most pitiful coping mechanisms.All the hallmarks of emotional immaturity and unrealistic romantic expectations are here: reading each others text messages, lying to your partner about previous/current lovers, etc, etc.The thing is, it's not a bad *movie* per se. It's just an exceedingly unpleasant experience to endure. Why anyone would subject themselves to two hours of this emotionally contrite drivel is beyond me. It's a well-made, mumble-core-ish melodramatic trajedy masquerading as a chick flick."
4,You feel this movie if you have been there and if you haven't...you wish you had.,"After reading multiple reviews on this movie it makes sense. Half of us have been here and the other half have yet to experience the emotional struggle, angst,love and love on, only to go back time and time again because you know that is where you should be. I see others point in reference of the story that is boring and goes nowhere. I guess it may if you have never felt that deeply. I first bought the soundtrack about a year ago and finally watched the movie last week. On my all time favorite list!"
2,disappointing,"Bummer, don't waste the time. Really slow, constantly waiting for it to take off, then it ends. . . :("
4,Unexpected,"when i first saw the commercial i was so exited for this movie then i watched it and was surprised. it was not what i expected but was realistic. the characters where believable because as humans this is sometimes what we go through, this couple is initially in perfect bliss then like life sometimes happens are thrown obstacle after obstacle and confront the challenges in their lives the best they can, even though that sometimes means falling in the arms of someone besides their significant other. some people disliked how heroine overstays her visa and gets herself deported but honestly if i really am in love with someone i would do the same because sometimes when in love you are blind and forget your responsibilities. i loved this film despite others beliefs and thought it was a accurate representation of what can and does happen sometimes."
4,Very good movie with a good look at young love and how much a long distance relationship can suck,"I really enjoyed this film. Nice soundtrack, excellent acting. I don't really get the other people trashing this film below. People offended that the movie didn't hold their hand through every single scene as if they can't think for themselves. Part of the message of this film is how hard it is to move on from a first love that really completes you (or at least you think it does) and at the end how life doesn't always work out perfectly."
2,Not that great of a movie,"I was really excited for this movie when I first saw the trailer, but when i finally watched the movie I was really disapointed. I loved everything about it except for the fact that nothing happened... I kept on waiting for something to happen, but really nothing happens at all. Also the ending is quote annoying, you never find out what happens to them."
2,frustrating love story that has you suffer through because of one characters decision,"i was truly looking forward to watching this movie especially with all the buzz but found myself almost immediately frustrated that by one character's decision, they are torn apart throughout the movie and a lot of people get hurt in the process. I don't buy the ending nor find it very satisfying and it's all done with a gloss over -- you have to piece together why one minute they are broken up and the next minute they are together. the deleted and alternate scenes do help. but still not enough. It lives up its title. Bonus -- jennifer lawrence has a small part in this movie."
3,"I Hesitate To Call It A Good Film, And Yet It Is","The feeling that you might get from this film is the same feeling you get when being told a story about people you don't know. You're moderately interested, but really you just don't care. As a viewer, you feel very detached from the action taking place. It's very anti-climactic, which was probably intentional, and it's not necessarily something to dislike in the film. It speaks volumes to have the audience not really care about the main characters of a story, because that's a reality we can all relate to: not really having a vested interested in the lives of people we don't really know. It's not a bad movie, in fact, as far as films go, it's very fresh. It's a nice change of pace from the prevailing current in films today. The film, as a work in and of itself, is good. If you are one who likes film as a medium for literature it's a good one, but it is a lot like listening to someone tell you a story about two people you just don't care about."
5,A great start for those who don't know the K3!,"The Kingston Trio opened the door for Dylan, Baez, Peter, Paul & Mary, and all the other folkies that became popular in the 60's -- and they did so because they were serious about the music & the quality of their performance -- they avoided preaching politics & got slammed for that, but they excelled at musical expression & continued the ""folk process"" admirably! Great harmonies & instrumentation are a hallmark of every K3 album, this one included."
4,Great 50s Hits,Great sound of the fifties the Kingston Trio were among the hottest musicians of the era! Give it a listen and share my high!
4,Great music,If you like modern folk music then you'll love this CD. There's a lot of the tunes made famous by the Kingston Trio (like Tom Dooley) and the sound quality is excellent.
2,Kingston Trio,Kingston Trio Greatest HitsIt was there best songs.Enjoyed it very much and would recomend it to anyone that has love for the good old days.
2,Inferior product,"I've used stovetop espresso makers before, but I don't like this one. The basket that holds the coffee....has holes that are a little too big....allowing too much in the way of coffee grounds into the actual coffee that is made. I guess you do get what you pay for...and I should have spent a few dollars more for a better brand."
2,"A novice, low budget film with no flair","A basic, low budget movie that makes the actors look amateur. Poorly written. There are some ""eerie moments"", but none that will make your hair stand up or get your blood pumping. The story line is unique and weird. Most of all, this movie is best off market because it does no justice being on the resume of Yancy Butler, whose talents were basically wasted on this one."
5,Great product! Yeah 20%,"As a daily user of glycolic acid treatment pads I was very delighted to see Glycolixs pads with 20% glycolic acid.I was thinking of stopping pad usage as I was unsure how much they were really working to keep my dull,shallow complexion at bay. Then I saw this product at 20% (the ones I had been using were 10%) and figured I would give it a try and have been really happy with it.PROS: What I really like is the pads are very saturated - not at all like some of the other brands you buy that almost feel dry and as if there is little glycolic acid mixture to them.CONS: The pads are thin and it is hard to separate the pads and often I was using 2 at a time. One pad is thin but strudy and never had one tear on me so maybe it is just me.I have recommended this product to friends who have been unhappy with other brands. The price can not be beat either - want a grea daily glycolic treatment? Try this one and I am sure you won't be disappointed"
4,A Feast For Thought,"FINDING CHISOLM is an outstanding first novel by Mr. Peake. His development of the characters and plot keeps one's interest at a high level throughout. His thoughtful insight into the subtleties of racism will give all non minorities food for thought. His poignant description of the attitudes of the residents of Chisolm and Harrison Sanders' conflicting reactions should reach all people--majority or minority. I highly recommend this book, and I'm eagerly awating Mr. Peake's next work."
4,1946 adition of true detective,"i have a 1946 and 1945 adition of this magazine. i was wondering if they were worth anything and if so i would like someone to get back to me please. i might have some other ones but i have to go through all the magazines,but i would really like someone to get back to me so i can get some information on my magazines. they are in almost perfect condition.thank you again"
3,great resource,"This book is a great resource, although a little technical for a beginning mushroom hunter."
5,Two of the BEST R&B singers out there.,"Oh my gosh, what a CD. Two of the best. AL Green, OH MY! TEddy Pendergrass, somebody come and fan some air on me."
1,lack of complete package the CD was missing!,"I was intereted in the book and cd, not just the book. Even though the transaction was inexpensive, it was a waste of money not getting the complete package as I desired."
3,The Good Soldier,"I had always heard good things about Ford Maddox Ford, but this was rather a disappoint. He comes across as a second-rate Henry James, with no where near the subtlety of James. The subtlety of Ford seems rather artificially contrived, and his narrator a fake American. Also, his characters are really not all that interesting. Fake, fake, fake."
4,"What is this, a rare edition?","Wow. It is weird to click on a book you own and see other people selling it for over a hundred bucks. Anyone want my copy?Whatever, I'm here to write a review.This is a book about redemption. An immoral man is sent to a strange planet by an immoral company to figure out why their immoral actions are not working. With an abundance of hubris and technology the man lands on the planet, and is quickly and definitively relieved of his pride and his machines. Only once he hits bottom does his redemption begin.It is also a book about a fascinatingly interesting planet. One of the fun things about reading sci-fi is that the authors are allowed to stretch their imaginations and give us fantastic new worlds. This is definitely one of them."
4,professional,I have read the the eleventh edition in chinese version. It describes the purchasing issues professinally. But unfortunately the writer can not give the analysising method for each case of each chapeter.
4,King of Romance sings on this classic studio album,Great Soul disco album featuring Luther Vandross and Jocelyn Shaw. Luther had his first big hit here before going solo in 1981. Although his 1978 Bionic Boogie album Hot Butterfly faired well record companies didn't take him as a serious solo artist only a session singer and jingle writer. The Glow of Love is very sensous middle tempo song with touches of soul all over. Searching is great also. Too bad they never made videos of those songs.
1,"oh god no, it's laurie anderson again. help!!! s.o.s.","It's not beautiful, it's not compelling It's simply one of the most disappointing records I ever bought. 'Walking and Falling', 'Born, never asked', 'Let x=x': they really don't do it. 'O Superman' is equally bad. If this record is one of the highlights of avantgarde, then what I am I to think of records like Fred Frith's 'The Technology of Tears', John Zorn's 'The Big Gundown', records which truly amazed me, and still do. No, I'm sorry, I won't be fooled again by Miss Anderson's theatrical pseudo-art."
5,Unique Music,"Laurie Anderson is one of my favorites to listen to while I'm working or driving. This disk is not for everyone. But, if you enjoy many types of music and can open your mind to a real alternative type, you can't help but like this disk. I've been to four of her concerts and enjoy her emensely, she's a very creative and talented woman."
1,Shafted,"I just received my "" Elite "" generator just in time to go on my yearly camping trip. I started it up and it puts out a total of 3 1/2 volts. Its kind of hard to run my fifth wheel campers' air conditioning on that kind of current. Now I've had to find a service center, haul it there, be told they can't get to it for a week and I'm out of a generator. Now I have to see if I can rent one, at probably quite a fee, to use for my trip. The engine fires right up but has a noticable miss every 2 or 3 seconds.The free shipping is also a joke, I got a call from a truck terminal a half hour's drive away to come get it. When I got there they couldn't find it. So many cell phone minutes later I was finally able to assist them in locating it. What an experience this has all been. Next time I'll go down to the local hardware and buy a Honda."
5,"A ""suite"" book for CS!","In addition to giving a great overview of how the six CS programs function independently, this book really shines in showing you how to work seamlessly between the various apps. The part on using CS with Microsoft Office files was worth the price of admission alone. This book is a great timesaver if you regularly work with several CS applications."
3,I think it's all right and good...,"I think this is a good CD. I downloaded the MP3. I prefer the Lynne Redmond MP3 I downloaded, but I haven't heard all of Goldman's stuff before. It's good music. It has some good vibratory effects. The MP3 did break up a little for some reason here and there. It didn't affect the music much, but I wasn't expecting that. That said, I would try more of Goldman's stuff. I have an open-mind, and I will continue listening to this. It's all right."
1,Another disappoinment from Rammstein,I fell in love with the band after discovering their album Mutter. Skillfully mixed heavy sound and foreceful vocals are no longer present in Rosenrot. All songs on this album are mellow and unremarkable. The vocals are not good enough to pull it off. The album leaves you with an impression that you just listened to poems read to some boring background music. I hope the band goes back to the unique and unforgettable sound of Mutter.
2,IS THIS RAMMSTEIN ???????,"I am a great Rammstein's fan, but this cd really disapointed me. I can't imagine the band performing songs like this on the stage. The DVD is fantastic, great old songs that make us full of energy, but the CD is a ""German-sugar-metal"" ! What`s the next ? Rammstein performing with an Philarmonic Orchestra like Metallica ? Making a duet with Celine Dion ? Come on guys, give us your best and heavy sound with a furious and noise guitars, and a agressive and consistent voice from Lindemann. If you want to invest your money, buy the old albuns from Amazon at the half price of Rosenrot. If you want to spend, try the new one."
3,"It's not the best cd, but works for Rammstein.","This is not a great job of the guys, nothing to compares with the Herzeleid, Sehnsucht or Mutter, but still entertain the fans of Rammstein."
2,Not the best Rammstein album.,"This is definately the weakest of all the Rammstein albums. It has a couple pretty good songs on it, but I would reccomend waiting for their greatest hits album, which I hear is coming to the U.S. soon, to come out to get them. If you're a die-hard Rammstein fan like me, this will gather some dust on your shelf. If your new to Rammstein, go with Reise, Reise or Liebe Ist Fur Alle Da, or any of the other albums and you'll be a believer too."
5,Rammstein is something...,"They never cease to amaze me. The songs although so ""simple"" sounding are amazingly complex lyrically. Very abstract and powerful. Rammstein has a certain formula that works great with their music and always has. I think this new album is definitely worth buying (as are the others). It's a powerhouse as usual. Energy and emotion blast out of the speakers."
3,Veranda Patio Table & Chair Set Cover,"I was very happy with the quality of the patio set cover. My table only has 4 chairs and it covered them just fine. However, I don't think the cover would have worked that well if I had more chairs. The cover appears to be smaller than what was advertised. I actually read that in a review prior to ordering the set so I figured it would work just fine for my set with only 4 chairs."
1,No service/or contact by vendor,"I tried to send it back but the vendor never contacted me It was too small, and I couldn""t use it!"
4,Good cover. Seems well built,Just received the cover and it looks pretty good. The handles are well built and the material seems family thick. It's mostly water proof and we hope this will last a good bit.
2,"good quality, bad fit","The quality of the cover was great for the price. Unfortunatly, I had to return it because of the unclear measuring instructions to determine which size cover would be appropriate for my table and chairs. I had the right table size, but the chairs did not go all the way under the table so the cover was much too small. I exchanged it for the medium which is still slightly small but usable."
1,Freezes my computer,"This is USR Faxmodem Lite. For my applications, which is steady faxing throughout the day, it works poorly. It will lock up after a short period, and then all faxing comes to an end (I have 4 fax modems attached). The only fix is a system reboot.I understand this could be a driver issue with Windows 2000 Server, but regardless, it doesn't work in a business setting."
5,the best parody about the führer :-),i recommend this classic movie highly ... it is available at last!!! great special edition. if we germans would have seen this movie in the thirties history would have taken another course ... hopefully!
3,"I dont like this movie, but great box set!","This DVD is now about to go out of print, so get your copy now before it does! This DVD has LIMITED Senitype, LIMITED booklet, soundtrack, and most people dont know, but it also has 8 Black and white glossy photos! I barely bought a new copy at a Wherehouse Music store and senitype was #1,333 of 15,000. HURRY!!"
3,"a classic, of course","Video quality and sound quality were great. Really appreciated having the ability to stream it to our computer instantly, because our son needed to watch it (twice) for a film making class. I only wish that the rental period was longer. The movie is 5-star, the rental period is what brings down this review."
3,Ciao Italia is Better!!!,"I have no CD of Madonna. But I watched her live concerts in LD format 10 years ago. And I've watched the LDs - Italy Concert and Tokyo concert- more than a hundred times.When I could managed to have DVD hometheatre system, I decided to buy a concert DVD of Madonna first. As I'd already had ""Ciao Italia"", I bought ""The Girlie Show"", the latest concert of her.But it was not as active as ""Ciao Italia"". And remixed versions of my favorite songs were bad. Especially, ""LIke a Virgin"" is the WORST remixed version. I didn't know that song was the ""Like a Virgin"" even until it finished. But audio quality of ""the girlie show"" is good.If you ask me,however, I recommend the Italy Concert,""Ciao Italia"".I am not good at English. hhheheh"
3,"Not the best, but gotta love her","Madonna has improved her perfomances considerably since this Tour. I absolutely love the beginning-who else can have a naked woman writhing down a pole other than M.Much of the rest of the show is very cheesy though, especially ""Like A Virgin"" - one of the worst ways she's ever presented it.I still love Madonna though. Just start with a different tour to watch. It's always great to see the progression of a great artist."
2,A debacle.,"This tour was heinous. Only the most forgiving Madonna fan could sit and watch this through AND enjoy it. The costumes were elaborate but it had far too much shock value, that just wasn't shocking. I felt she was going too far to be outrageous and it lacks the stylish cleverness that she embodies in her Drowned World Tour, which is MUCH better! I would have also preferred more dancing and less of the huge boots she couldn't move in. ...Happy hunting."
3,plug in the right way works great,"didnt work, until i found the plug in on the unit to plug the motor into. now it works great."
3,"Okay, but.....","The disc itself was just fine, but it was a different disc inside then the one advertised. Inside was Tennessee Ernie Fords Greatest Hymns, not Greatest Hits!!! Good thingI l like hymns!"
2,Popcorn book-movie to kill your time,"The author definitely had a movie and bucks in his head when he wrote this book. The quality of the book plummeted as the result. It's just a description of movies that you've seen zillion times: enclosed space, monsters or obstacles coming one after the other, in the last moment the main character beats the monster (obstacle) to find the next one coming. NOTHING NEW unlike Jurassic Park. Value for your mind = 0. Not a great literature for sure, just a fast food to kill boredom."
5,"Great book, wery interesting and exciting.","Another great book from Michael Crichton. The book wery exciting , expecialy a part when giant cuttle-fish attacks. When I started reading it, I wasn't thinking it will be so interesting. Author opened a whole new world, and I reccomand this book to everyone."
5,An enthralling experience!,"The time it takes you to reach the last letter of this book, you are taken out of this world asa responsible person by the suspense! It was my first science fiction experience and it couldn't have had a better start.It gave me a real ""kick"" reading this story that twists and turns several times. All in all a great book."
3,Sphere,"It is usually hit or miss with a Crichton novel. This one falls somewhere in between. The story is intriguing but suffers from some gaps of logic. SciFi is great but to make it plausible, the author has to make it possible for you to relate to the people in the story line. In ""Sphere"" it is rare when one of the characters acts as you would expect you might act in a similar circumstance. At least this wasn't written deliberately like a screenplay as was ""Prey"" which was, I believe, a transparent attempt to force a movie out of the book."
4,Excellent Sci-Fiction!!!,"This is the book which dragged me into Sci-Fi genre. I've read all of Michael Chrichton's book and this is his best work according to me. The plot is excellent, fast-paced, thrilling and horrifying.Its about an unknown alien-craft found deep inside the ocean. Scientific testing says its down there since 300 years. A group of people expert in their feild are sent to seek the truth behind it. Although, it sounds a bit like ""Rama"" series, the content is totally different. The characters are real and the suspense will get your blood-pumping. I was only a little bit disappointed with the climax.I'd suggest this book to both the Sci-fi Fan's as well the non Sci-fi Fan's."
5,This book is the best!,"I loved this book! I couldn't put it down. The suspense, and depth with which Chrichton wrote it is astounding. He really knows what he's talking about, and he's not just making up crap like most sci-fi authors."
3,To many unanswered questions,"Having read ""Sphere"" many years ago, I picked it up again to refresh my memory before seeing the movie based upon it. It was as I remembered it. An average Michael Crichton thriller. The characters were a bit stiff and one dimensional and the ending had a rushed feel to it. Above all the book left to many questions hanging. 1: Where did the ship/sphere really come from? With the powers it exhibited, it seemed likely that it created the image of an American ship from the future based upon expectations the discoverers had. I have no doubt had theobject been discovered by Russians or Japanese military it would have looked like it came from their future or another species. 2: Did the charaters lose the power, and did they really have it or was the sphere reading their mids and creating what they wanted?"
5,This book is still great despite it's disapointing ending.,"Sphere is one of the best books I have ever read. It is very original and very interesting. The book is exciting from start to finish. I found it impossible to put down. Although the ending was sort of a disapointment, the beginning and middle of the book more than makes up for it."
5,Sphere,"Sphere is the most amazing book I have ever read. It goes from a Sci Fi novel, to a mystery who done it type in away. I am not going to spoil the ending to just keep your Imagination open and expect the unexpected!!!!"
1,Don't waste your time.,"With so many good books written, don't bother with this one. Weak plot, page filling words and obvious situations with an obvious ending leaves this book as very ho-hum. Michael must have been under pressure from the publisher to pump this out. Read Timeline or Jurassic Park instead."
3,new sphere found in ocean,This was not one of my more favorite Crichton books. There was acctually to much detail in this novel. Although the action was intense in some parts of the book. Over all I would have to say tha I did not enjoy it that much.
5,Possibly His Best!,"Michael Chrichton's writing is superb! Even though the first part of the novel, The Surface, is boring, after that there are no flaws. Crichton writes with a suspense style that keeps you flipping the pages so fast, you don't realize what's gonna happen next! Truly a good ending as well. I still am desisding if this is his best book. I loved The Andromeda Strain, and I loved Sphere. They are just two of the many Crichton books I have read. It's close, there both excellent novels. Go read them now!"
3,Did the book just...end?,"I liked this book for the most part although considering how much imaginiation this book requires the ending sure doesn't. Did he hit a deadline and was forced to submit to publish or did he just run out of ideas? I thought that maybe they would use the spaceship to fly to another universe or something but to decide they want nothing to do with it they just decide to forget it and ok guys were fine now the books over. Uhh, ok? Well I mean that doesn't really solve anything. Eventually another group would go back down there to check the ship again and the same thing would happen. This book could have been another 400 pages. I don't know am I missing something? I read State of Fear and even that could have been another 900 pages. Is there some quality to a story that doesn't explain everything? This kind of feels like Crichton just gave up. This always happened to me in high school when I would procrastinate homework."
5,The Sphere is Here,"There is no doubt about it, this book rocks. Usually I read books and give up after a chapter or two, but this book kept me interested the whole time. Every page was exciting and fun. One of Crichton's best works and it was very exciting too."
5,recommended reading for those who like psychological dramas,"After reading the other 2 reviews, I felt compelled to say that I too thought this book of Michael Crichton's was a thriller. I don't have the best concentration when it comes to book reading, but so engrossed was I in a particular hair-raising passage in this book, when I was tapped on the shoulder I threw the book across the room. For a few minutes, I felt as if I was actually there in that predicament. This book, as well as Airframe, were the most exciting for me. Couldn't put them down. Skip the movie, I was horrible."
4,"Good Story, worthless ending",The story was really quick over too fast very entertaining but worthless ending.
5,THE BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN,"This is my favorite book, and is Michael Crichton's best. I couldn't put the book down because it was so suspenseful and thrilling. I think that everybody should be able to read such a fantastic book like this. Many people say the ending is disappointing, but I thought it wasn't at all! I read it all in one night because it was just so good, and never wanted it to finish because the story was stupendous. READ THIS BOOK!"
4,Crichton is too good an author to not like his books.,"A traditional Chrichton. The begining lags, as usual in Michael Chrichton. Then it gets good, and the mystery falls in. Then it gets to the ending. The ending was slightly dissapointing. There were unanswered fates, such as Hal C. Barnes' fate. But, maybe some things are better left unsaid. There should be a warning on the cover. WARNING: not for people with high blood pressure or respiratory or cardiac conditions."
4,"Great book, bad ending","An absolutly brilliant book with wonderful story line. The auther did a beautiful job on pulling the reader into the story line, helping them to get attached to the charecters. To bad about the ending though, it is almost as if Michael had a deadline and sort of tacced on the last 15 pages. The book is still worth paying for if not for the whole thing then for the story at least"
5,Beyond gripping,"All that this incredible novel needs is a squillionth rave review about how involving it is. So I will be brief. If my personal experience will shed any light on what you're getting yourself into -- I opened the book sometime during the day, read about half, and then picked up the last half at perhaps 1 am. Next time I look at the clock after reading the last pages and digesting that monumental decision that the characters must face, it's 4am but it feels as though only a few moments have passed. Crichton just has the knack for putting you in a trance, what else can be said? It's debatable whether this is his best work (I would actually argue for ""Airframe""), but that's beside the point. These novels are treasures, they educate and thrill and keep us guessing invariably."
1,Not very well written...surprisingly disappointing,"Being a Crichton fan, I was very disappointed by this book. Crichton usually writes in a combination of theory and fact, which is what makes his books so interesting. However, this book is just way-out ""weird dream"" fiction. If you are a Stephen King fanatic, you may like this...it's just like Tommyknockers, only add an ocean. It was too unbeleivable to be enjoyable. It could have been made interesting if the alien object (the sphere) was the focus of the book, rather than the exploration team. Where did that thing come from then? What was it designed for? And, why? Who knows...in this book all that matters is the 3 member team left at the end of all the weird stuff!"
5,Majority rules!,"if i hadn't read this book in the first place I wouldn't have gotten involved with Crichton's books at all! How could anyone not like this book? Call me mad you criticizers, but i didn't think there was a weak point in the entire story. Go Michael!"
2,crichton is no asimov,"Reading this, I could tell that Crichton loves big Hollywood movies, filled with young groovy scientists and lotsa shiny special effects. He also loves computers and high technology and space travel and the theory of general relativity. It's a pity then that he can't apply his mind's eye camera and grasp of all things technical to the writing of a decent sf novel - Sphere does has some intriguing ideas about time travel and alien life, but the execution is lousy - uneven pacing, one-dimensional characters and a conclusion that fizzles. If you think this is great literature, go back to reading pop-up books."
1,SF only a non-SF reader could love.,"As an avid SF fan I was disappointed to realize about two thirds of the way into the book that it was basically a mish-mash of the novel Solaris and the movie Forbidden Planet (with the Fruedian ""Id"" replaced with a Jungian ""shadow self"").(spoilers)There were also some basic plot problems as well that bugged me. At several points the characters were worried that their habitat would run out of air or that it would be destroyed in another attack by the creature. Apparently they forgot that they were parked right next to a half mile long spacecraft that had survived over 300 years on the sea floor and was full of god knows how much breathable air!"
3,"Movie, not a book","Unreal characters. Bickering, vain, almost comedic. SNL could use these guys in a skit.Would make a pretty good movie but not good in book form."
4,GOOD AND FAST PACED CRICHTON!!,"In a way, very typical crichton. A good plot but a lot of unanswered questions. If you have a good imagination you may like this book even better, but if you like neat tight fitting stories, sphere left me with a few questions. The book does make you think and does bring up some interesting points as most of crichton's book do. This should turn out to be a very good movie, there is no shortage of action, drama and tension."
3,It's Small!,"I bought this item after I visited my friend in Paris and she made me some coffee in one excatly like this one. I have tried making it myself...but for some reason it does not taste the same. It might just be me...but I do like it for being small, that way you do not have to make a huge amount and then waste it."
1,Disappointed in BonJour,"I received this as a gift and was thrilled to receive it. While it made good espresso, after only three uses the main filter (the basket where you fill the filter with coffee grounds) broke. The stem came apart from the filter basket rendering the espresso maker inoperable. I called BonJour Products to ask about the possibility of getting a replacement filter. The very pleasant customer service agent said the filter itself wasn't being made anymore, put me on hold, came back and said she was mistaken it was available, put me on hold again while she checked on the cost and then told me the filter itself was not after all available for sale and that I'd have to buy a whole new espresso maker. Not at all happy with BonJour Products' management's response, I'll just replace it with a Bialetti instead. Bialetti has replacement filters available on-line as well as in kitchen stores."
5,The perfect mix of beautiful photography & detailed info!,"Salvage Style is the perfect book for anyone with a passion for recycling and a love of beautiful, creative things. It features gorgeous, decorator-style photos that provide plenty of inspiration, but it balances them with a wealth of information about the importance of reusing perfectly good materials and the process of doing so. All of the projects have detailed, step-by-step directions---complete with photos for the more visually minded folks out there---and most of them are easy to replicate. If you're looking to expand your mind and look at common materials in a new light, this book will fan the fires of your creativity in ways you never imagined!"
3,video was ok,"Didn't like the video as much as we had hoped.I thought it was a Christian project, and I don't think it was.We never even finished watching the whole thing, sorry."
5,Younger Brothers,"I would have to give this book a 5 star. As you see, Carl W. Breihan is my father and I have a copy with images of all his books he has written about Jesse and Frank James and the old west. I also have pictures of my dad on the back cover of his jackets. I also have a barber chair that Frank James had his hair cut and shave. His signature is on the bottom of the seat. If you would like to contact me please do so at jculbertson283@msn.comJanis Culbertson(Breihan)"
5,Pretty good for an up a rising Melodic/Progressive rock band,"Found this band via a review ay OpenUpAndSay.com, and I find their music pretty good. I've been into the Melodic rock/metal scene for a short time, and am always looking for a band with a good solid, and strong melody within their songs that not only complements, but also enhances the standard rock instruments via the melodic additions. Silvio Massard, the Vocalist, also has a really good and strong baritone voice that just keeps on adding to the music contained within..I look forward to seeing what else this Band will produce as time goes on..."
2,Writer's style mars book,"a previous reviewer stated the book was intellectual & philisophical. I only find it superficially so. The writing is verbose and full of obscure references, beyond joe/jane average. Buy another book."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!,"The item I received was NOT authentic *BonJour* merchandise - it appears that the seller is dishonestly passing off generic items as name brand .The box lacked any reference to the manufacturer, as was the case with the item itself - which is, of course, NOT the item pictured, which shows the brand name 'BonJour' at the bottom - in fact, the only place in which the brand name 'BonJour' appeared was on the sticker placed on the box by the seller."
2,Only 1 cup serving,The fact is that this french press coffee maker only servers one (1) cup of coffee and not 3 as in the manufacturer's description. This is expensive for a one (1) cup coffee maker!
3,great brew,"nice coffee maker. little messy. too expensive for what you get. still have to filter coffee to get sedement out, even using very course grind. good flavor"
1,Frustrating device,"BonJour Monet 8-Cup French Press, BlackThis was a gift from an enthusiastic user.There are no markers for number of cups, and the device uses a fair volume that isn't recovered in the decanted coffee.I have tried using a measuring cup, but the volume of a measuring cup is different than that of a ""coffee cup"".It's hard to calculate how much coffee and how much water to use. Really annoyingThe coffee is okay, but not exceptional.I e-mailed the company, but didn't get a response.Frankly, I'd like to smash it.Sorry to complain, but they could and should do much better."
5,One of the top ten pop recordings of all time.,"This recording is truely brilliant, it evokes unforgetable mental imagery which I thought was impossible to produce in a recording studio. This early 1980s configuration of mindboggling african rythms combined with samples of televangelists always evokes a reaction from the listener. This is a must-listen for anyone who consideres themself a true lover of the avante-garde."
2,Missing a few essentials IMHO,"Temp review for the quick read I did as I just sold the book:Well written for the most part, easy to follow.Negatives:Federal Reserve Act relegated to one sentence. The nefarious legislation of 1913 affected this country in so many ways, it deserves at least a page.The CFR (Council on Foreign Relations is not even mentioned) Inasmuch as the majority of our 'leaders' in this government are members of this secretive society I assert it also deserves at least, one page.Why do authors continue to relegate footnotes to some distant part of the book, thereby aggravating readers to no end ?Holy Alliance ? This term is used without defining what he means.Possibly in the next edtion the author might add a bit of discussion about how corporations, foundations, associations and the shadow govt play a part in our 'foreign policy'.all for now"
4,I love this and it's saving me lots of money at Starbucks!,"I used to just drink Dunkin Donuts coffee but now I have to use soy milk because my baby is milk-allergic. So I discovered how delicious a Starbuck Soy Mocha Latte is. Yum! (...) i bought this little device and now I can froth up soy milk with cocoa powder and sugar, warm it up, and add it to coffee and it's almost as good as Starbucks. It is so fun to use it, although sometimes it's hard to keep it from touching the edges of the cup. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I sometimes wish it could keep an even stiffer foam (maybe it's because I'm using soy milk?). The kids love it when I foam their hot chocolates too. I highly recommend this."
2,Won't make thick froth so don't bother,"I purchased this BonJour frother to replace my old AeroLatte frother. The difference between the two brands is startling! The BonJour frothing tip is a solid wavy metal tip which actually OVER-froths the milk. This causes the bubbles to keep breaking down. I can only achieve a very thin layer of foam and it won't last long. On the othe hand, the Aerolatte frothers(also widely available with several models on Amazon) uses more of an open-metal mesh tip on their wand which must be responsible for how thick and dense a foam it will create. I'm buying another Aerolatte and will use the BonJour wand for things that don't need thick foam (like mixing salad dressing)."
4,Nice Christmas sound,Pretty much a generic mix of Anne's music for the holidays. Makes for great background holiday music and is a good quality recording.
4,Their not gone,"Old skool is always the best. What, ZAPP they make you feel good everytime I listen I pump it up loud"
2,Not my thing,"There is a certain subgenre of literature about the Third World that insists on reminding the reader of the heat, bugs, filth, poverty, and misery on every page, turning the problems of the developing world into a sort of fetish. Scribbling the Cat epitomizes the style. In this book full of vivid images, very little actually happens; the protagonist, ""K"", is a crazed, violent pseudomystical freak on page ten and a crazed, violent pseudomystical freak on page 250. Two stars not one due to Fuller's strong, vivid prose."
1,Rage at Dawn,Very poor copy - not sharp. Amazon.com should not offer such back copies. I try to trust Amazon.com to treat me right.
1,Tantra of Sound Harmonizer,"Not as advertised. I just started yoga/meditation and thought this sounded great BUT nowhere in the description online did they say, ""that in order to get the ""full benefit"" as intended with this product you ""must"" wear ear phones, but of course you can listen without ear phones however, you ""will not"" get the results intended. Only after I bought it and got it home and unwrapped it did it have this information available. It would have been more honest to give this information upfront/online before you buy the product. Personally, I would have bought another at the time, but now I do not trust that another would not have the same limitations. And although I have been wearing headphones and listening every night for more than four weeks, (very uncomfortable when trying to fall asleep) I can't say that I have received any benefits as was advertised. Very dissappointed and would NOT recommend this CD to anyone."
4,Tantra of Sound Harmonizer,"I was pleasantly surprised as I began to work with Jonathan Goldman's CD's. I use this one to enhance intimacy with my husband, as background for meditation, and in my clinical practice to encourage clients to come to balance."
4,Alwys put me to sleep.,"I am not sure it is meant to relax me to thepoint of being unconscious, but it does."
1,Abridged? You're telling me!!!,"Don't buy this tape! If you are going to spend your money then buy the book ""Superlearning"" instead. While I am a great fan of mind expanding techniques I would say that this tape is just ""interesting"" to listen to. It does not tell you the techniques and I only found a little value from it rather than a lot. I already had a copy of ""Superlearning"" which, incidentally, I found very good, so I thought that I would just get the audio of this one to listen to in the car to brush up on new wrinkles. I am not saying that there is anything wrong with the superlearning technique, I am just saying don't buy this if you want to learn about it!"
1,"I don't know about the tapes, but this book is RUBBISH!!","Do yourself a favor, don't buy this book, it's nothing but a list of commercials; i felt really bad in realizing i was actually paying ten bucks to read commercials. I might give its Audio tape a try, but this book add no value to your life, it's a time waster!"
4,"One of my Top 3 ""Life-Changing"" Books!","First, I'd like to counter Mr. Jim Schenk: Can't you even bother to check the index or the contents page and just go straight to the How-To section(and YES,they DO tell you how to go about it)? Don't squelch the self-esteem of a person who may be still starting to use it. That'd be one potential superachiever less on this Earth!Anyway, I rate it No.3 next to ""Awaken The Giant Within""(No. 1) and ""Einstein Factor""(No.2)"
1,Don't pay to read commercials!!,"it's just full of commercial and telephones, I don't know about the tape, but this book is RUBBISH!!"
1,Interesting but not that good!,"10 videos, each one 50 minutes and labeled with a specific title. The topic and areas covered on each video are absolutely inaccurate, and unfortunately, boring. They are very old news footage releases that are redundant and some times irrelevant--that are not even applicable to the title on the video. The pictures on the video box are better than the tape! Not a good purchase!"
4,Victoriously written!,"This is an incredible story of courage, love and strength and a real page turner! After reading this book, I realized that others may try to victimize you, be you never have to ""own"" victimhood. Ms. Morris-Grant proves this point again and again in her story. She isn't afraid to reveal the truth about herself (all of it), and in doing so, she challenges the conscientious reader to do the same.While I would highly recommend this book to anyone, I would ESPECIALLY recommend it to women who feel trapped in abusive relationships. Ms. Morris-Grant proves that you can truly rise above even the worst circumstances with faith, love and a continued sense of hope."
3,El Loco isn't a classic but good.,"After reading a fellow reviewer report I have to disagree with him/her.This album was released before Eliminator.This one was released in 81,Eliminator was in 83.This album has a new wave sound like so many albums from this time frame.I admit it was quickly put together due to the record company pushing for a hit.Cheap Sunglasses was huge for them in the 70's.Although its not a commercial succsess like Eliminator[thanks to mtv videos of those girls} their careers took off.El Loco isn't a classic album but its fun for entertainment purpose."
5,Great Start.,This book was great because it filled in parts of the story we didn't see on the show. It was a fast moving story and I am glad I read it. I think it was kinda wierd reading about Angel and Buffy when they wern't...well you know. I really liked it.
4,A great introduction!,"The first novel based on the WB series introduces you to the characters. It's an exact copy of the pilot episode were Buffy comes to Sunnydale and meets Xander, Willow, Cordelia, Giles and Angel as they learn more about The Master and his harvest plans. This is an excellent book for all who missed the pilot, but also for those who watched it, it's still a good read. I gave it 4 stars. It lost 1 star due to the fact that it's an exact copy."
5,I thought it was pretty intresting,"The book is descirbed in the best ways of an author could descirbe in it. Its got great charcateristics, a good way to visual it so that you can see it in your mind. Its also got some good action that you could tell that it was going on. Once I saw it on TV, I liked it and from then too now andI haven't missed a single one. The series is the based on the book. I had walked into the library and I seen the book, and the next thing that had happen is that it came home with me. Once I started to read the book I could not put it down. Since then I have been reading every-single book that comes out on Buffy The Vampire Slayer."
3,Super Reader,"The Harvest is a retelling of the story told at the start of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer tv series. A novelisation of the tv show, if you want to put it like that, taken from the Whedon script. There is a master vampire in Sunnydale, and on one particular night he is able to open a portal and summon an army.Buffy has a new Watcher, and meets some new friends at her new school, after being booted out of the last one, and has to come to terms with all this and deal with Head Vamp into the bargain."
2,Too Smooth for my taste,"I'm not going to diss this album, but the direction beanfield has evolved in just doesn't interest me. Almost every track has vocals, very smooth soulful light R&B vocals. The vocals tend to be the main focus, rather than the interesting sounds or creative programming that made beanfield's previous albums catch my interest. The songwriting and arrangements are consistently non-offensive. and maybe a bit bland to my ears.Great brunch music. Not very exciting though."
1,Poor quality enamel,"Our bucket did arrive with the bail (i.e. handle), but the handle is not attached upon arrival and requires modification to stay securely in the holes on the bucket. We have had this bucket for less than a week and already it is chipped twice. The enamel is poor quality, I would not purchase this bucket if you need a bucket for any substantive (rather than aesthetic) purpose."
4,It is a great album,"It's on the line of Still Crazy, but a little darker and much slighter. It certainly is a great piece of work. Maybe it shouldn't be recomended to those who are not PS fans..."
2,Firewire option does not work,"Any video recorded via the DVD-Direct firewire connection in Standalone mode does not work for me. I get unstable video when I playback the same on my DVD Player, laptop and PS2. Camcorders used were SONY DCR-TRV530 and Panasonic AG-DVC30P. Video fed thru DVD-Direct ( standalone ) S-video and composite inputs works fine on the same DVD+RW discs. Also works fine with the included NERO software. But the major advantage this model was supposed to have over others was the standalone firewire input. And that has failed for me."
4,"Solid item, tech suppert lacking","I purchased this item a few weeks ago and have used it to burn data DVDs, CDRs and also direct to DVD from my VCR. I am very happy with it. However, I upgraded the firmware in the device and after this I was unable to copy directly from my VCR into the device like I had in the past. Sony tech support tried to get me to send the device back to them. I hunted around some more and found a new video direct firmware version. Looks like the new firmware for the device needed the new video direct firmware to run DVD direct correctly. It would have been nice if the tech support person informed me of this instead of telling me to RMA it. Other than that the device has made me very happy burning DVDs. I would recommend using 2 DVDs to burn anything over 2 hours in direct mode as the 6 hour setting is just too pixelated for me. I will be burning the rest of my taped football games onto 2 disks. You can use Dual Layer disks, but they are still very expensive at over $5 each."
1,No widescreen,I just bought this unit a couple of days ago and tried with DCR-HC42 videos I had taken. It cannot record widescreen format (16:9). Sony support line confirmed that I cannot record widescreen using VRDVC20. Ironically SonyStyle packages this product with HC42 as VRDVC20PAK4. Bad choice - I am going to return it & get some other DVD recorder for this price.
1,A Minimal Burner,I can burn a simple DVD+R with this recorder but I have not been able to burn a Double Layer DVD+R that has more than one title or any chapter stops.
5,CLASSIC MINNEAPOLIS SOUND,"My condolences to the new fans of The Time who didn't grow up with them ""in the mix"". Let me just take a moment to correct you and to let new listeners know what you should get into. This album is the quintessential Minneapolis sound album. The Time is the greatest R & B band of the 80s.......because they established the Minneapolis sound. Even though Prince wrote the album as Jaimie Starr, The Time actually blew up quicker than Prince. Now I am a huge fan of both. There is no topping the new funk sound of ""Cool"" and ""Get It Up"". Who didn't go to parties spelling C-O-O-L way before we began spelling 2000 in ""1999""? Remember those days? Needless to say, ""Girl"" was THE ULTIMATE SLOW JAM when this album was released. The passion that is unleashed in that song is astounding.

4,Make your own insults and enrich your vocabulary,"This book contains a wide variety of insulting words used in Shakespeare's plays. Each page is cut into three sections, so that you can change about and put together different combinations of words to make up your own insults. So for instance you can call someone a ""concupiscible hell-governed foot-licker"" or a ""cuckoldly lily-livered geck"" or possibly a ""facinerious leptus-leering fustilarian"". Or anything you like. There are some wonderfully rich insults in this book, which should be enjoyed by anyone with an interest in the english language, Shakepseare, the Elizabethan era, or just someone who wants to expand their vocabulary of insults."
1,NOT THE DIGIPACK,"The song is amazing. Great track....but this is not the right version. This is the standard run thin jewel case, not the limited edition. it only has three tracks. BOO! i ordered this the day they put it up for sale here back in March-ish...it ook forever. and it was the wrong one. AND they wouldnt take it back cuz i unwrapped it not knowing it was the wrong version. AND the case was cracked. FUG you amazon."
2,I recieved 3-tracks CDS,"Me too.I JUST RECIEVED MY COPY OF THIS CD, AND IT IS THE WRONG ONE. IT ONLY HAS THE FIRST THREE TRACKS IT SAYS IT HAS. WHY?"
2,The zipper that didn't work,"Endless Summer Model 251958 Patio Heater Cover For 34-Inch Domed Heaters review. The cover fits well and is easy to use. The down side, the zipper broke the second time I employed the cover. My impression is that the cover is sturdy, fits well, rendered useless by a poor quality zipper."
4,Charrmin Introduction to Paris for Youngsters,"Written and drawn in 1959 this children's book taught me a thing or two about a city I thought I already knew a lot about. The pictures and scenes are wonderful in bright colors and include most of the major sites in Paris from ""le metro"" to Montmartre and the Champs Elysees.There have been a few of the drawings, or accompanying text, that have been asterisked to reflect the changes that have occurred in Paris since 1959 but if you are taking young ones over I highly recommend this book as a way to make some of what they will see a little more understandable for them."
2,red scam vampires,"If you ever saw the classic 1974 film ""Vampyres"" by José Ramón Larraz you'll pretty well have covered this poor modern low budget film.This has many of the same elements of the 70s film but Valeria Dombrovschi can't compare to a Marianne Morris or an Anulka Dziubinska.The same elements; fangless female vampire lovers lure men to their domain and ply them with a special wine, then feed. There's even the shower scene of the two of them lamenting wether to get rid of one man they've hung onto for a while.There's also a couple near-by doing a survey, and like the classic film there's a similar run-in between the wife and the vampire ladies.One of the few new elements is that the vampires become encased in a skin/cocoon. I thought another might be their black eyes, as per the box cover but this has no relation to their appearence in the film."
5,put your ear to the burner,"I've read countless volumes of poetry over the years, but no one can hold a candle to Mckuen's warm. He puts his emotions on the table and fortunately for the reader, a lazy Susan is there to ensure that no one goes to bed hungry. ""Follow women after dark,"" Mckuen instructs, ""they can only cry for help or whisper 'yes.'"" And I am shouting Yes, this book is a true classic."
3,out of date,"This is a good book for those who love hiking and live in Ohio, as it identifies a number of good hikes throughout the state. However, it is out of date. My boyfriend and I traveled to Oak Openings Metropark to hike their long hike only to get lost when attempting to follow the book because the trail had changed since it had been published. I recognize that this is partially my own fault -- I should have checked the copyright date and did a bit more research prior to heading out there, but I would recommend that, if you use this book, you also get an actual, updated, trail map of the park and rely on that map rather than the book to find your way. The book is a better resource for identifying interesting parks and naturalist information in the Ohio regions."
3,Imperfect printing of an important work,"Great text, but in this printing the illustrations appear poorly printed (they are pale), especially noticeable when compared with those of an older edition. Perhaps the quality of illustrations is peculiar to my copy, but the reproductions seem consistently light."
5,A Classic Album,"Prince's 1980 album DIRTY MIND is one of his best albums from his decades long career. The album features a more stripped back production, but the music is still pure soul/funk. There are some really memorable, classic Prince jams here such as ""When You Were Mine"", ""Head"", ""Uptown"" and the title track. It's a brisk album at 8 songs, but all are integral to this album. Prince produced, arranged and composed the whole album. He found success starting with this cd, his third. Deservingly so, this is a classic album that may be his best album."
4,This is what it's all about,"Those who love Prince's rebellious sexual energy oozing out of every note...probably already have this:). It began with Soft and Wet, but this is like the pinnacle of sexy with songs like the title track and Head - which some find tame by today's standards, but we must remember those standards were set by songs like Head 20 years ago! You have to admire someone who will take the risk of doing his own thing. This album is full of fast-paced, disco-style, party greatness with a mid-album breather in Gotta Broken Heart Again. Even if you don't like where Prince has taken his music in the last decade or so, this is truly classic Prince and nothing compares."
4,Shocking for its time,"Whne I was in High school in the late 70s and early 80s, we eagerly awaited the yearly release of new Prince Albums (as the overall state of R&B; was so dismal at the time).This was one of his most, er..""interesting"" ones. Quite shocking for 1980-81. He actually sings of the ""joys"" of incest with ""Sister"" and ""Head,"" well, that speaks for itself. The title tune and ""Do It All Night"" were not so hot. ""Party Up"" was quite raw for it's antiwar chant near the end (considering that the US was not actually involved in any war at the time).The original album had a nice poster of Prince's original band that would be later known as the Revolution.It's interesting also to consider that while the kids who listened to this in 1980-81 upset their parents by listening to ""Dirty Mind"", these very same kids are now upset over THEIR kids' rap cds. Go figure."
1,They pulled a fast one on us,"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is one of, if not the greatest score ever composed for a film. But this new ""expanded"" and enhanced CD is a travesty.It's pretty unbelievable that this ""expanded"" version still contains the 5-minute version of ""Il Triello"" (The Trio) that cuts off abruptly and without any proper buildup or denouement at the trumpet fanfare. And considering that ""Il Triello"" is one of the defining pieces in the entire score, and represents perhaps THE defining moment in the movie, it's also unacceptable.My advice is simple: Skip over this one and order the Italian import version, which is easily available from Amazon. It's titled under the movie's Italian title, ""Il Buono, il Brutto, il Cattivo."" It may cost more, but it is well worth it almost for the complete ""Il Triello"" alone, as well as the complete 6-minute ""Story of a Soldier."""
3,OLD,"This book is really really really out of date. There were a few good games in it for my kids, but for the most part it was useless. The section on computers is so completely obsolete that it was amusing to skim through. It was written in the 80s - they need to produce a substantially updated edition!"
5,CD-Hwy-101,This is by far the best CD that they did. Nicki made these guys even better. I loved her sooooo much more than Paulette. In fact I wore out my first CD and had to puchase a second.
4,good addition to Helter Skelter.,"A must have for any Manson collection. The writing was not always perfect but the story seems true from a different perspective, not just legal mumbo jumbo. It is a classic."

3,"Great Information, Not So Great Writing","This book does a great job of presenting ample ""food for thought"" about a group of people who, to this day, manage to mystify us in regard to their motives, views, etc.This book does not do a great job with continuity as the writing jumps around by presenting facts and ideas about subjects that have yet to be introduced and/or explained. The author also likes to uses terms and references to people, places and things that the reader has no idea about. One example is the first reference to The Diggers. I had to look up the subject on the Internet and by the time I found out who The Diggers were the momentum intended by reading the author's work had disappeared. A second example is a first reference to ""Wavy"" without an explanation of who Wavy is and then a later explanation of who he is.If you can get past issues like the aforementioned you will have an enjoyable read."
2,Good product just not what is in the picture,Read the fine print I guess. The product is probably perfectly good but it was the rods in the picture I wanted. Just personally hate it when the picture is not what you get. I know I should read the description more carefully & I take responsibility for that.
5,"Torch edition of ""The Transformaton of Man""","Like all Mumford's books, there are such erudite analogies in this one that you have new tangents to explore. As Volume Seven of ""World Perspectives"" it was first printed in hard cover in 1956. The Torch edition was published in 1972 with his new intro acknowledging a widening of his own perceptions and that ends, ""The more hopeless our present situation seems, confronted...by both ecologically unbalanced environments and psychological unbalanced minds, the more imperative it is not to lose hope... The coming generation still has man's oldest [option], cultivating the arts that make man human."""
3,"Not to be confused with ""Ancient""","Made in JAP in 2001, Serial# BVCP-27015~6, Playing Time 87:58This 2-disc set is NOT the japanese equivalent of the ""Ancient"" album.The music here is more in the direction he's used for the ""Gaia"" album than ""Thinking Of You""; there's some occasional chanting and some flute here and there, and KITARO's keyboards and sound textures are as recognizable as ever.Relaxing, but not as transporting as earlier albums ""Oasis"" or ""Silver Cloud"". I was also disappointed that the total playing time of the 2 discs barely exceeds the capacity of a single disc: I could have lived without 2 tracks in order to fit on 1 record, which would have reduced the price of this japanese import significantly.This is typical 90's KITARO, and not one of my favorites. I would suggest you wait a while to see if this will get a US release."
2,Too fragile,Had the same problem as other 2 star reviewers. Glass broke with normal use after 2 weeks. Just shattered during frothing. What a piece of junk! Just use a french press if you have one it works as well and will probably come with a better made glass container.
1,They Broke and don't work,"I bought these because I had heard they wre ""The best"". My wife is an experienced cook who has used different types of pressure cookers all her life. Very soon, within weeks of use, each Pressure cooker had a complete failure. Of the two units, EACH of the gas pressure release valves on EACH unit broke, and the metallic pieces on the top of the cooker each broke off. My wife was able to cobble one together. it is in pieces, but she has made it functional and she can use one to cook with. The other remains broken. What a waste of money. The high expense of these units seems to have more to do with High European Union wage rates than advances in quality or technology. I would not buy these again."
2,Very relaxing except for the birds,"The sound of the water rushing over rocks on this CD is very relaxing. The only problem is it also has the sound of birds chirping which is very annoying. I did not hear these birds chirping when I first played the sound sample on Amazon.com. So if you are thinking about buying the CD for the sound of water alone, you may want to look at a different CD."
3,Not Bad,"The first two songs, This is not a love song and whatever the name of the second song is, and the 8th song, whatever it is called, are very good. The rest of the album is fine, but it all runs together. So, go for it."
4,Awesome game!,"I enjoy watching the TV show ER. So that has inspired me to learn all that I can about disease and being a doctor. When I heard about this game, I just HAD to get it. So I have been playing this game, It's diffucult and has some Sassy personality. But it really encourages you to do EVERYTHING right, and that is how it has to be in real life. The one thing that I can't stand is exactly how to do some discharge and get points, because it isn't mentioned anywhere."
3,A Little Complicated,"What kept this product from receiving more stars is its complicated use. First, it's difficult to get on the can, not comfortable to turn and very ackward to take the top off. I was only going to give it 2 stars, but gave it the extra star because it never touches food so the blade never gets contaminated by food in the cutter and always remains clean. However, if I was going to buy another can opener, I would look for one more user friendly."
4,can't use lid to squeeze contents,"It really does cut smooth. I can RUB my finger against it and not get cut. It's also built very sturdy. I definitely could throw it across the room and I'm sure it'd be just fine.Because it cuts around the edge, you can't push the lid in to squeeze water out of tuna cans as easily. I do this still but it's more difficult."
4,Once you figure it out it works much better than the old ones,"This item takes a minute to learn to use, but you will LOVE it. I just took a minute to teach each of my family members how to use it and they all love it too! Definitely my favorite can opener. (I've had it three weeks so far)"
4,All I've Got...,Picked this up on the cheap for $8 with free shipping. I hadn't played X-Box in a while and felt like being nostalgic for college. This game was perfect for that.
5,very good,"This book said something I will never forget. Man's true meaning, like a movie , is not revealed until his life is over. Reason is what man gives himselffor motivation when he is faced with unavoidable suffering."
4,funky folky herky jerky rocky rolly,"avande garde roots rock , a contradiction, but this is what they accomplish...Still trying to figure these guys out, all I know Is I like them.Sounds like 'classic freak rock' by that I mean Captain Beefheart circa 'Safe As Milk' or Beatles, circa 'White Album'.Production values stripped way down like all those 70s, 80s 90s studio gimmick cheese treatments never existed. (so here you can hear all the instrumentation for what it is in each channel)Good songwriting, good musicianship ...Thank you Zutons. Viva la Zutons!"
1,Poor seams,"Poor seams, ¡¡they started to fell apart in the second day of use!! Wouldnt buy it again, and would love to have my money back."
5,The music I want to hear when I'm dead,"An odd title for a review, perhaps, but true none-the-less. As I am lowered into the grave, let a solitary piper play ""Dream Angus"" and I will rest content. The Weavers have captured something on a very visceral level here; while some of the songs are tongue-in-cheek and some are quite energetic, all tap into an undercurrent of longing that is so much a part of the Celtic soul. If you want music that will make you misty-eyed, buy this album. If you want music that will make you dance with anticipation of what the new day holds, buy this album. If you want music that will make you want to cross the border and steal English cattle, buy this album."
4,Great music,"A friend of mine burned a copy of this for me years ago, and I loved it so much that I bought it. The vocals are brilliant and you won't mind getting the songs stuck in your head. I especially love Fancy, and the cover of LL Cool J's Phenomenon--you've probably heard it on Cadillac commercials."
5,great,once i used this i couldn't believe i hadn't bought one before. it's very easy to use and has nice feel and weight. almost seemed to cut whisking time in half. great product.
3,Gold Platforms,"Ran 1/2 size small. I'm a perfect 6-1/2 so I ordered a 6-1/2 and it was too small so I returned it. It looks exactly as it does in the picture though but for some reason it did not look as nice in person. I prefer my charles by charles david gold ""loop"" shoes which are true to size."
5,A brilliant show!,"I found this, sort of by accident, while browsing through Netflix. So glad I did. Jekyll is fantastic. Stephen Moffat has created a wickedly good take on Robert Louis Stevenson's classic tale, deftly brought to life by the performance of James Nesbitt. I was so hooked that I watched the whole season over a weekend...absolutely fantastic!"
5,Perfect replacement,"Pefect replacement for original that ran contiuously for 22 years. This one uieter and has more air movement capacity, but the same size. Eay install."
5,Life saver,"During my recent kitchen remodel, my pressure cooker saved my life. All I had was a single burner, but that was enough to turn out a meal that tasted as if I had spent hours in the kitchen when I didn't even have one. For me it feels like magic--I still cannot believe how good lamb stew is when it takes just 25 minutes to cook. And I love to put in a nearly 5-pound chicken, some vegetables, and a little broth and let it rip for 25 minutes. I never worry about excess pressure because of the redundant safety features. It's a much handsomer pot than it looks in the photo. It is definitely NOT my mother's pressure cooker!"
3,At least the photography is beautiful,"I was a little disappointed with this book but that was because I was expecting a little more sophisticated ornaments. My fault, actually, because the title is 'Instant Gratification'. The projects aren't very complicated, and many can be done by children.My biggest complaint is that the print is so small, it is very difficult for me to read the supply list and instructions.However, the photography is fabulous! It really shows off how elegent these simple projects can be."
3,Ocean Waves CD,"I do like this CD. There's no music, just waves. Some of the waves are very loud and fierce and not so relaxing. I guess I would prefer smaller, more relaxing wave sounds. There is a big difference between waves, so if I turn it down, I can't hear some of the CD, but if I leave the volume on normal, it can get really loud. Overall, I'm glad I bought it."
