4,"Worthwhile Read, Interesting Topics","I really enjoyed this book and reading the insight of Kit Tremaine, Verna V. Yater and Kevin Ryerson. The topics discussed were all very insightful and touched upon the more important issues in life, (What are we doing here? How can we be of service? How to help the homeless problem? Are past lives real? Etc.) I particularly enjoyed the take on Karma being more about completing issues rather than a punishment and about finishing personal issues and turning to service to others rather than having life be about service to self."
5,Damages,"Since I can't view the series on TV any more, I was left wondering what happened. I bought the season..... excellent as usual. I will buy the final season when it comes out."
4,Wow - what a series,"Sometimes hard to follow and nearly without R rated adult love which one might hope to see in such a series, this is a spell binder that will have you coming back for all the subsequent year editions (up to four now)."
5,Damages=knowledge,I find that it had great information and dealt in detail about giving circumstances that shown each character and plot in a way to believe. I watched all with great enthusiasm.
4,Good Read!,"Dion was a healer and a wolfwalker. Being one was special. Being both was rare. She had a bond with the wolf Gray Hishn. She must battle warlags, find her twin brother, outwit angry slavers to save some girls, and try to spread word of the upcoming war. She had written proof of the war. Proof that the slavers wanted back.Soon she and her fellow travelers find themselves lost in the wilderness and fighting to find a cure to an eight hundred year old plague. Dion must learn ""Ovousibas"". (How to heal from the inside.) No one had ever survived the attempt. Both wolfwalkers and their wolves always died. But there is no other choice.***Goes from fighting, to white-river riding, to cliff-climbing, to more! Non-stop movement. Best Sci-Fi I have read in a while.***"
4,This book will leave you breathless!,"My wife recommended that I pick up the Wolfwalker series after I had finished reading the Wheel of Time series - and maybe that was why I gave this novel 4 stars instead of 5. Tara Harper has created a vibrant character in Dion and the beginnings of a wonderful story line that plays out over the next 5 books in the series. I found that as the series progresses, I became more and more engrossed in the story.My only minor gripe is that in this novel more than any other of the Wolfwalker series, her pacing of the action is relentless. The world that Tara Harper has created is such a harsh and violent environment that both Dion and the reader never are given the chance to take 'a breather' and unwind. In many fantasy stories, I feel drawn to the world itself - yet on the Wolfwalker world, I think its the last past I'd ever want to live!Overall, add this to your list of must read fantasy series..."
2,Lots of information... no precise order!,"Positive Qualities --- This book does have a lot of interesting information for the time period it talks about.Negative Qualities --- There is no organization to the chapters (if thats what you want to call them) of any kind!!! It's hard to understand everything that happened within these 300 years when the author goes from talking about 1250 to 1113 and back to 1270 within 2 paragraphs. It's also hard to keep track of what year each event happened in. Then he goes from talking about one specific person to talk about a whole new person, but 4 pages later drops the new person and returns to the other person again for a few more pages... NO ORGANIZATION OF ANY KIND!!!"
5,This is a great book. Nice mix of mechanics and computing.,"I learned a lot from this book. It is well crafted, has a lot of new things, and obviously a very timely contribution"
5,Naked and Ready To Turn The Whole Thing Over,"An AMAZING song from a truly AMAZING artist. Unlike so many ""artists"" out there today, Deborah Gibson has consistently made fantastic music. She has written and produced her own material from the start, and is still recording classics almost twenty years later. She has remained an inspiration to her dedicated fan base, and has NEVER disappointed. This song takes that to the next level. The vocals...Hypnotic. The arrangement...Perfection. This song has *number one hit single* written all over it. Radio would be foolish not to give a song like this a chance in an age of crappy repetitive hip hop. Come on-Its time to ""turn the whole thing over"" and give the ORIGINAL princess of pop another chance at success!"
3,Tad pricey for the size,I'm pretty sure I paid a bit of a premium to get this before Christmas but it's my youngest son's first 'real' cologne...
5,Fantastic scent.. after years with another - im back to it,"well - i had used this for about 6 years.. and then switched to nautica latitude longitude as my girlfriend didnt know guy code (stick to the same colgone) and bought me it.i was obligated to use it than!After they stopped making Nautica L L, i was in Macys and saw they still made Polo Sport. I tried a spirt and it just brought back so many memories..I said SURE.. ill be back to buy, came right home and ordered from amazon.great scent, manly, not musky at all, not over powering, no fruity type of smell.a very clean and sporty smell. goes with any occasion."
2,Two stars for two good songs,"The first two songs that is, U2 and NIN. The rest is badly mixed techno babble. I want to like it, but just can't.Disappointed."
3,this has a sloppy feel.,"I thought, maybe, just maybe, this could be a ""Matrix"" kind of deal...not a chance.Of the songs that I really wanted, I'll say this..Nine Inch Nails ""Deep""..nothing earth shattering.Good.Not great.Chemical Brothers ""Galaxy Bounce""..sounds like one of their b-sides.They are steadily losing mucho ground.Moby's ""Ain't Never Learned""..one track that you aren't really expecting to kick butt and yet it does.Excellent.Basement Jaxx ""Where's Your Head At""..easily the best track out of 15.Superb.Bangin'.Loud.Outstanding.Fatboy Slim w/Bootsy Collins ""Illuminati""...great stuff.Fluke, Outkast and Groove Armada contribute decent tunes..all previously released and the Leftfield track is 6 years old.The rest...hogwash."
4,ebullient,"I was shopping for nothing in particular when I heard ""Edge Hill"" playing over the the CD store's sound system... I bought the Tomb Raider Soundtrack (and a Groove Armada CD) on the appeal of this one slow, smooth song. The other songs are pretty good, but I'm a bigger fan of tracks 09-15 than of 01-08. I don't usually go for something this frenetic, but at a lower volume, the more iritating tracks work well as background music."
5,Rocks!,"Definitely a keeper. The beat is non-stop. The re-mix of ""Get Ur Freak On"" is great, which is unusual enough in itself. I can see myself wearing out this CD!"
4,The best soundtrack!!,"This is one great soundtrack! I was disappointed in the movie,But this C.D. has wonderful original eletronica music!"
5,Belkin 7-Outlet with 12 ft Cord,"This surge protector is great. Nice quality cord and the connections made are secure. The right angle plug does help to keep the cord close to the wall, which is nice underneath a desk or for a TV behind an entertainment center.The lifetime warranty and $100,000 connected equipment warranty allow me to be confident in my surge protector choice.What could be a drawback for some is a plus for me: the on/off switch is on the side of the surge protector. I use this for my plant grow lights, and the surge protector is on the top of the apparatus facing down. The side on/off switch allows me to turn the power on or off quickly."
4,Simply good.,"This was a rare textbook wherein one could ""hit a groove"" of material that seemed so useful and immediately practical that putting the book down would have seemed a misservice to humanity."
4,review of earths children,"Clan of the cave bear was the best. She put a whole lot of sex in all the rest and it gets rather graffic, so if that offends you don't read these books. Auel kind of leaves you hanging and I wish she would write the next book so that there would be some sense of closure"
3,This works and is easy to use,"Good... what do you want me to say, Damn expensive? Am i wasting my money? Well the answer to both is yes."
3,ok for the price,"It's OK for the price. Halo was broken when received as well as wings. Dress is very sheer. Need to get child white clothes now. ""Fur"" is cheap on the collar."
3,"Mixed feelings about ""Marley""","My husband and I adopted a Lab mix from the local Humane Society when he was about 6 months old. Some of the Marley tales reminded me a lot of our experiences with our Lab. How we handled those situations were entirely different, though. Like some of the other reviewers, I was cringing at some of the obviously terrible decisions that the Grogans made. The book could really bring about some endearing memories of your own pet, as long as you can stomach Grogan's mistakes."
2,Funny in the beginning but lost ALL respect for the Author by the end,"I thought this book was very entertaining in the beginning and I rather enjoyed reading it, that's why it got 2 stars inlieu of 1. Many things reminded me of my dog and I actually laughed out loud a couple of times. But this author, who claims to love his dog, does not act the part at the end of the book, and I just don't get his wife at all. Maybe it's because I feel our companion dog's lives are too short and they are like family to me, but I just can't understand this guy. I do not want to say more and give away the end of the book in case you are planning on reading it, but it left me furious with him and I had one word to describe him - selfish! If you love dogs the way I do, you will enjoy the first 1/2 of the book and HATE the second half, and it will be clear to you what I didn't like about it. I REALLY wanted to like it..."
5,Lovable Lab,"My heart has been stolen by two Black Labs that have shared my home but you don't have to be a lab lover to love this book - but you better be a dog lover! It is beautifully written, funny, sad and endearing. This is the type of book that just makes you laugh and cry, and gives you a wonderful trip down memory lane. This book is a must read for anyone who has ever lived with a lovable canine clown. It is a wonderful tribute to all the four-legged family members we share our lives with."
1,A dog-gone boring book,"Hey, I'm a dog lover and have had dogs most of my 48 yrs. I was so looking forward to this book and very disappointed.I kept reading further and further...there's got to be a good pay-off to this story. I felt cheated by the hype on this book."
4,Marley and Me,"I bought this for my grand daughter, she loves the book, as she did the movie. I only gave it 4 stars as the print is very small."
1,Poor Dog,"This book could be more properly sub-titled ""Life with the world's worst dog owner"". I'm surprised Mr. Grogan would admit to his inept and unfeeling gaurdianship of the unfortunate Marley, let alone write a book about it."
1,Disappointing,"This book is a truly smarmy piece of self-indulgence. I'm sorry Mr. Grogan, but I have absolutely no interest in the fact that you had a dog that you and your wife couldn't control. What made you think there was a compelling story there is beyond me. As was stated in a review below, this book is more an attempt at an auto-biography than a heartwarming book about a beloved Lab as the publishers would have you believe.If you want to read a great book about a dog and his family, get ""The Dog Who Wouldn't Be"" by Farley Mowat. Mutt will definitely steal your heart!!"
1,World's worst dog OWNERS!,This book was very upsetting as the owners of Marley repeatedly show their ignorance and cruelty when they repeatedly abuse him and then they had the nerve to make money from it by writing this book. The Grogans even get to a point where they are inviting friends over to kick poor Marley in hopes of training him not to jump. One day Mrs. Grogan is found beating on him after he did something wrong and had to be pulled off of Marley and on a regular basis Mr. Grogan would choke the dog in hopes of getting him to behave. Even as years and same behavior went on they refused to take the dog for proper training. Why? This is the question that is never answered. When a dog misbehaves it is because of improper or lack of training and not because the dog is bad. Don't waste your money on this piece of trash. I feel so bad for the suffering this poor dog endured!
2,Marley and Me by John Grogan,"A friend, knowing I'm a dog lover gave me this book. I saw the cute puppy on the cover. The humor was at times very funny (except the part in the airport where the dog was crammed into a crate where his back end wouldn't fit and he couldn't turn around. Then forced to ride on a 3 or 4 hour plane ride).The part that REALLY BOTHERED ME was all the profanity. Most of it began with either Jesus this or God that. Anyone who would pick up a book about a dog doesn't want to sift through profanity. It's difficult enough to try and have a conversation with someone who swears, why would someone write it?"
4,fun reading and touching too,"I loved Marley and I loved the book. I grew up with several dogs and now raise an extraordinary example of the tribe, and I just know that whatever is told in the book must be true. It is a great book - funny, touching without being too emotional and very realistic, as every dog lover can testify. Go for it! You will spend a lovely time with Marley."
1,The World's Worst Owners.,"I can't believe all the positive reactions to this book. The owners were abusive to this dog, never got help from behaviorists, used choke collars, and hit the dog.Then they blamed the dog for his fear.Please don't use these tactics for your dog and abuse is not funny.Marley was just being a dog."
4,MARLEY IS A MUST!,"As a first time dog owner, this book validated all of the frustrations and joys a faithful companion can bring. Even if you don't own a dog, you most likely know someone who does and Grogan's story highlights just how much effort a ""well-behaved"" dog requires. The story of Marley will make you laugh and cry, but most importantly realize that no dog or dog owner is perfect and that's okay. Reading Grogan's story made me feel that I was part of greater community of non-expert dog owners and their canine friends who fumble through life together, all the while creating memories."
4,Fast read,"This is more like a personal history of the author with dog stories weaved in. That being said it is a great book, if you don't like dogs after reading this book then......"
5,Makes Me Appreciate My Dog & Life Every Day!,"Not much to review, other than I thoroughly am enjoying this book with the laughs and tears associated with it."
5,Marley & Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog,"A funny, poignant, and delightfully entertaining recounting of a family's life with a very special dog."
5,A Wonderful Story,"I just finished reading this book about 20 minutes ago and just thought I would share with everyone how absolutly wonderful this book is. At first I was a little bit reluctant to buy it because I thought it would just be a boring book that doesn't go anywhere. I don't think I could have been any further off, by far one of the best books I've ever read. It is a story that I'm sure most people can relate to. Truly an amazing book that I hope everyone gets the chance to read. I hope everyon enjoys it as much as I did."
3,"Vale: Marley, dog of character","I'd like to think that Marley is now in a space where arthritis, old age and thunderstorms no longer exist.Marley sure had an impact on his adopted human family and, as a human adopted by a dog or two, I could relate to that. I'm glad that John Grogan shared this story with the world but am very, very happy that my experience of sharing living space with a dog is so different.My dog, Sir Bruce the Battle Rat, wishes readers to know that Jack Russell Terriers are not at all like Labradors. But that is a different story, and one we may choose to write ourselves.Recommended for those who've shared their lives with a dog and sometimes wondered 'why'.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
4,Dog lover's book,"This is a enjoyable book for dog lovers. It is thought provoking regarding the true nature of dogs and their thoughts,feelings, and whether they may even have souls. Mr. Grogan writes with style and emotion allowing the reader to laugh at the situations that Marley created. If one has ever had a dog or has a dog, this is a must read."
1,Not for True Dog Lovers,"I read this book a few years ago and at first did see the humor in it, though I do agree with another reviewer here that these people were to dumb to have a dog, especially a lab, well-known for their kind disposition but difficulty with training. My real problem with this book is the ending, and *warning*, this is a spoiler for those who haven't read it yet. After years of putting up with these two idiots as owners, Marley who becomes old and ill (as old animals will do) also becomes inconvenient when the family decides it would like to take a vacation. Yes, they put the dog down because he is now in the way of their fun time - pathetic. I'm not saying that eventually if an animal is in pain decisions like this need to be made, but that was not the case in the book. It's just another example of the throw mentality most humans have when it comes to pets."
2,I don't get the hype,"John Grogan seems like a nice guy, a good father, and someone you wouldn't mind having as a neighbor. But this book read to me like someone's tedious, overly long, self-involved cocktail party chatter about himself. This guy's life and dog were just not that interesting. I am a lifelong dog lover, but I could barely make it through the whole thing. I just don't get the hype."
5,Excellent Book To Own Or Give,"This book is charming, heartwarming and absolutely touching. It is a must-read for any dog lover and a wonderful book to own or give as a gift."
5,Great Book,"WOW! ""Marley and Me"", I must say, is an amazingly good read. Following Marley's antics from puppyhood to the bitter end, this is an astounding book, with heart and wit. The last chapter will make you laugh and cry, but just about everything before that will just make you laugh. From the day Marley met John & Jenny (Back when he was ""clearance dog"") to the end of his days, everyday seems to be eventful at the Grogan house. This is a must read, and the New York Times doesn't dissagree. This book has been on the best-sellers' list for a year. So, go back to the product info page right now, and click ""Add To Cart"". You'll be happy you did!!"
5,Beautiful memoir of life with a 4-legged friend,"This is one of the best books I have ever read! A dog lover and an owner of 2 Labs, I found Marley & Me to be a story right out of my own life!This book is a beautiful memoir of a man and his dog, and the story of his puppy love-turned-frustration-turned-wits' end-turned-lifelong love that he shared with this animal.If you are looking for a book that teaches you how to deal with behavior issues, this is not what this book is meant to do. It's simply a story of life with an animal, that truly becomes a love story. The kind of love you experience when you own a dog, and allow him to become part of your family.I recommend this book to anyone wanting to bond with your dog, wanting to appreciate him more, or just wanting to be moved by a lovely story."
5,Marley and Me:Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog,"Loved, Loved, Loved it. I couldn't put it down, although I knew that the author would eventually be losing his best buddy. I knew the waterworks were going to be turned on by the end of the book and I was not wrong.As I read the book I could picture myself having Marley run towards me and knocking me down. I have a Golden Retriver that does the same thing to me. But no matter how I look,or how down I feel, that dog LOVES ME, just as Marley loved his family.It makes me wonder how any family can have any great memories without the love of a family pet. Thank you so much to Mr. Grogan for such a wonderful read.Donna K. Reed- Illinois"
1,I just don't get it,"this book is really about Grogan & his fam (and not a terribly interesting family at that!)very, very sad about Marley (one reviewer called the Grogans ""kind"" in general but certainly not in their treatment/training of the poor dog)i have to say, i just can't finish it"
1,Cruel Pet Owners - Should Be Ashamed,I agree with all of the negative reviews. These people do not deserve to share there lives with one of these noble creatures. It broke my heart to read how this dog was treated - - and then BLAMED.
5,My mom loved this!,"Bought this book for my mom as a birthday present. Her dog Sam looks just like Marley, when he was a puppy that is and is probably just as mischievious. She really enjoyed it. I'll have to borrow it from her one day. I read the inside cover at a book store and my eyes filled with tears. I knew she'd love it. Of course I book on amazon.com for a better deal than in the store. Great book, highly recommend."
5,Dog People Will Love It,I enjoyed the book very much. I loved the people story that was woven into Marley's story.
5,Funny & Sweet,"I had this on cd and listened in my car driving around during errands. I really had fun listening and looked forward to hopping back into the car for the next installment! Great, loving story."
3,Cute but...,"This is a cute book. It's well done, but if you are looking for a quick pick-me up, I would recommend the Wisdom of Zeus book over this one--I gave it out as XMAS gifts and never had one complaint or blank stare."
5,moving story of a man and his dog,"John Grogan's Marley & Me is a charming, funny, and sad diaryof his experiences with his Labrador retriever, Marley. We see Marley grow from an cute puppyhood to obnoxious adulthood to a more sedate ripe old age, and finally meet his inevitable end after surviving several close calls. Grogan tells a bit of his life story in the process--his job as a newspaper columnist, the births of his children, problems in his marriage, crime problems in the neighborhood, and moving to a new state and job. It's a well-written, moving story that may make you laugh out loud and shed a few tears. Highly recommended."
5,Best Book,"It is true in reading Marley and Me you will laugh,cry, and shake your head! Marley and Me was the best book i have ever read and i will recomend that book to any and every body!"
4,A Personal Favorite,"Author John Grogan offers a heartwarming depiction of his family's life shared with Marley; a big, goofy, loyal and loving dog. At times I found the writing self-indulgent, but overall an enjoyable life story that leaves you heartbroken and completely in love with a 100 pound Labrador retriever you've never met. Living in the West Palm Beach area, I have a sincere appreciation for this book."
5,For any dog lovers,"If you have ever had a dog and experienced their intense loyalty and love, you will enjoy this book. It is very funny while still maintaining an emotional attachment to Marley and his family."
5,Excellent wonderful book!,"Oh just finished this amazing book today & it is possibly one of the best books I've read, so special and talk about poignant and tears running down the face laughing out loud. I couldn't wait to read it all but didn't want it to end. Oh but did he capture what all us crazy dog folk, animal folk, furbaby lovers cherish most which is to say the heart and souls of these splendid creatures. Thank you to the author for writing such a wonderful story!!! Maybe we could hear about Gracie too?"
5,Marley and Me,"This is a hilarious book, one of the best books I've read this year. Although the book can be enjoyed by anyone, it will be especially appreciated by anyone who owns or has owned a dog."
5,I can relate,I don't know how else to put this so this review is going to be short. If you LOVE dogs you will LOVE this book!
4,my dog is named marley too,This light reading. It had me giggling in my chair and it kept my interest. If you don't like the down part of when the animal ages just stop reading the last two chapters. I passed it on to others it was that good.
1,Extremely disappointed,"As an avid dog-lover (who may sound fanatical, but I am not), this book bothered me for a couple of reasons. First, Mr. Grogan says how much he loved Marley.....but on the other hand, his wife and kids left for Boston and they took a family vacation when Marley was on death's door. I have trouble leaving my dogs enough......but they mean enough to not to me to not drop them off at the vets for a week when they are very ill. Also, you keep on saying ""just a dog""....well my faithful companions are a true member of the family and would never be referred to as ""just a dog"" when referring to me emotions. Try reading ""The New Work of Dogs""....that is a book truly for dog lovers. I questions the motivation for this book....was it for money or a tribute to your faithful friend. Also, I thought it was inappropriate to call Mr. Rodale ""eccentric""."
5,Love it.,"This book made me laugh and cry. As an animal lover, I highly encourage other animal lovers to read this book!"
4,Marley,Read this book for a book club- enjoyed it and had a few laughs. Interesting writer. Seems as though the author should have read James Free's boon --Training Your Retreiver.
4,Great Reading,"What a great book! I don't even own a dog (never have) but I still enjoyed this book. I have cats and they do ""things"" as well but not on the level of Marley. The section of the book dealing with Marley's passing was very touching and anyone who has ever had to make the decision regarding their old/sick pet can feel John's pain. I highly recommend it for people who own pets or not."
4,"Grogan, not Marley steals the show","This book was a pleasant surprise. I had no idea I'd be so moved by the relationship between Grogan and his lab.Plenty has already been said about this book, but perhaps not enough on Grogan's style. Yes, Marley was a wonderfully flawed dog with enough personality to fill five books. But the joy of this book is Grogan's wit and writing style. There are other Marleys out there, but there's only one John Grogan."
4,Loved it!!!,"If you've EVER had a dog, then you've experienced at least one of the things John Grogan mentions in this book!My husband and I have a Lab/Corgi mix, so we get some of the Lab craziness topped off with the Corgi attitude. While we haven't experienced all of Marley's doings, we can definitely relate to some, especially the disaster that was obedience school!!I haven't laughed out loud at a book in ages - I get funny looks from both the dog and my husband every time. I'm sure I will come back to this book every time Watson, our dog, does something crazy. This will be a family treasure for years to come."
4,No Violence,"I sure hope Mr. Grogan uses some of the millions he made from this book to fund anti-animal abuse education programs. Because of John's ""success"" with such training techniques such is kneeing your dog in the chest to the point that it can't breathe, countless thousands of other pet guardians feel validated in their use of violence to control their pet's behavior. John has brought a tremendous amount of pain to many animals through their guardian's kicks and punches which often fracture bones and damage organs and other body parts. Shame on you John, for the pain you have brought to so many pets lives by promoting the use of violence as a training tactic. There are other ways to train other than 19th century barbarism. Do you beat your kids too John?"
4,marley & me,[[ASIN:0061687200 Marley & Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog]]Good book for children
4,Even a dog hater like myself loved this book,"When my book club choose this book as our next selection, I was less than thrilled. I don't like dogs, and have never understood the obsession that many of my friends have with their furry friends. Then I read this book and didn't put it down for two days. This book made me laugh out loud and even I could relate to this man and his dog."
3,If you're a dog lover you'll like it,"This is a cute, simple story about a family and their dog. An easy read if you're not in the mood for something deep that you have to concentrate on. One fun thing I did was buy the kids version for my son and we read them at the same time so we could talk about different things that happened in the book. The chapter about John taking Marley to dog beach was particularly funny. On a sad note the family seemed to be more interested in taking vacations and business trips and leaving the poor old sick dog in a kennel than I would have liked to see.I cried my eyes out at the end. And I haven't stopped hugging my own two dogs. But of course from the beginning you could see that coming."
2,Needs a Works Cited Page,"While this book was intriguing, I find its credibility lacking. A lot of what Greer says seems to be made up off the top of his head. While he could be accurate, he really needs to go into more depth about how he found his information instead of assuming we already know his sources. The closest he comes to a works cited page in this book is a further reading page, which really doesn't help his book at all.An interesting book. Not to be taken too seriously with his lack of proof."
3,Interesting but irrelevant.,"As someone who has spent most of my short life trying to understand the paranormal and occult I believe this book poses some very interesting ideas. Interesting as they are they mean nothing to anyone who is at all serious about the paranormal. There is an interesting talk about the abduction phenomena and Faery that I have seen parralleled in other works. The rest is just dribble. I showed the book to some of my Wiccan and other ""magically inclined"" friends (of which I am still puzzling over the validity of magik) and they were all very angry at some parts of the book. However it is a fun read if you want to read something that is ultimately much more fiction than fact."
3,A melancholic self-righteous travelogue,"Stevenson's trek in the Himalayas is unique in that he came to no real ""spiritual"" answers; instead of trite Western musings on Buddhism and the Eastern mind the reader is presented with refreshingly honest and candid accouts of a two month stay in Eastern Nepal. However, anyone without his particular aesthetic approach to the trek is immediately branded a superficial obese Westerner; only four or five non-indigenous people are painted as sympathetic characters. Self-righteousness is sometimes present in the descriptions of his fellow trekkers, but a well-balanced anthropological and personal account is still gleaned from the book."
5,Minister Weasler,Absolutely the best information I have received about how to know and understand God's leading as a leader!! Every Pastor / Leader of a ministry should get a copy of this DVD! It will change your outlook--IF YOU LET IT!
3,HUGE umbrella,"Well, this is what I get for ordering an umbrella online- I opened it up and found it was *massive*. I know little about umbrella sizes so I just assumed, because Gust Busters only makes the one size, that it would be reasonable for walking to and from work. However, it's much too large for me!"
2,Not all that I had hoped for,"Shark' Cordless Sweeper NOT all that I hd hoped for. I am physically handicapped, yet can walk and lift only the lightest of ofjects. This Shark is fairly light weight, but is difficult to get a good rurning radius on. I find that I have to go over areas at least 3 times in order to make carpet look clean. Well, not clean as it does NOT dig very deep for dirt. It is handy for light touch-ups, when you hear that the in-laws are going to drop in soon. The foot on/off switch makes it easier. It is cumbursome to get it to manuever. For picking up pet hair - forget it !! Yet, it is easy to empty the concents, once you have copletsed your job. Overall, NOT the best such product on the market. CarollJ820 (if you must print real names - Carol J Hoffmaan"
4,Nice to quickly clean up fur and cat litter,"I was pleasantly surprized by this lightweight, re-chargeable sweeper. It does exactly what I want it to do, which is to quickly pick up fur and cat litter which is tracked on the carpet close to the litter box. It does better on carpet than on bare floors, and you wouldn't want to try to vacuum your entire house with it. But for limited, quick clean ups on carpet, it's great! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is limited as to what it will pick up on bare floors."
1,Worse vacuum ever had........,"don't waste your money(not even a $1)on this product, it never works and the battery last only 10min. after 6 months of used. I made a big mistake and I hope everybody don't waste the same money just like I did."
5,Love Epson Inks,"Absolutely would buy no substitutes for my Epson printer. These archival quality colors make photos that last. The colors are clear and not muddy, and perform perfectly on the chosen papers."
3,half-baked MST3K,"First of all, let me just say the short that preceeds thems movie is one of the absolute 2 or 3 funniest shorts they ever riffed. Many people think the shorts were the best, and this one may prove it. I cannot say the same for the feature though. The host segments are good and the movie is a big enough turkey that the boys can rip on it, but the riffing gets a little weak near the end, and despite some hilarious lines (even bad episodes have 1 or 2 great riffs), this one doesn't have any that really stick out nor is non-stop hilarious such as ""Space Mutiny"" or ""Pod People"". A good but not great MST3k."
3,Did the job with some adjusting,"This looked great when it came. I judged sizing by the kid in the picture...well, it was smaller than what I thought it should have been. There was no time to exchange and I did not contact the seller. I had our costume director make the alterations needed (she did a great job!) and it worked great for our production."
5,PHONE CASE- BLACK,"I purchased this item for my husband. He wanted one exactly like the one he purchased 5 years ago. It stood the test on time, very durable and strong material. I am very sure this one will be just as great as the other one. Great lasting item."
3,Good protector for kids,"Upside is color option. In addition, it does protect chocolate to some degree. Perhaps good for kids. Downside is it is bit bulky and kids does not always wear belt. You may want to remove the belt clip before handing it to your kid."
5,Excellent Compact Camera,"Best features: Ultra compact, light, and stylish; large, easily viewable LCD screen; and excellent photo quality under normal conditions.More Pros: 5x zoom is larger than most compacts; image stabilization, multi-point focus, red-eye reduction, and other features work as advertised; excellent start-up time and refresh rate without flash. (Refresh time with flash is average.)Cons: Expensive batteries and poor photo quality at high ISO settings.Bottom Line: This is a stylish and highly capable ultra-compact point-and-shoot camera."
1,Disappointment.,"I have been using a Canon point and shoot for 5 years and wanted a ""faster"" reacting camera. Got the Sony T-100 after reading many reviews. I am disappointed by the quality of photos, the time it takes to set the menu I want, the difficulty to navigate between the different options. I tried to use the automatic setting and that one is not great either. Well, mine is for sale...is anyone interested???"
5,"Finally, a camera that I will really carry around","I've been waiting in the wings with my adequate but big and clunky Olympus C-720, waiting for a shirt-pocket camera with the features and performance of the larger digitals. The large display of the Sony and an upcoming vaction finally goaded me into action. This is the camera that you will truly take everywhere during the day. The snapshots are adequate quality, and the few that have problems are more than made up for by the increased number of opportunities for memorable pictures thanks to the ease of carrying this camera around. A bit pricy, but once I winced and paid the price, I never looked back with a ""maybe I should have bought that other one ...""."
4,So far so good,"I recently bought this phone, and it has performed very well. Yes, the keys are a little ""soft"", and you have to be sure to press them down firmly, but that's a minor inconvenience when you factor in the good speaker phone quality (for the other caller and for you), the ease of setting up the phone, the clear functions, etc. One note of caution: I had bought this same phone last year, and it was doing very well until I inadvertently pulled out the longer hand-set cord I had installed--the phone went ballistic, gave a constant busy signal, and was unusable, so I had to ditch it. I would advise sticking with the shorter cord the phone comes with, if you don't have to move around the room a long distance from the base unit. It's a fine phone so far (about 1 1/2 months since purchase)."
2,Caller ID function is WORTHLESS,"If you are like me and use headset, need a speakerphone, mute, flash, and caller ID and ordered this phone I am sure you have figured out by now the Caller ID function is absolutely worthless unless you have the phone mounted on the wall or are willing to lift it up to see it everytime someone calls. Thankfully I still have my battery powered GE caller ID box I can still use..I EXTREMELY dissapointed these phone makers try to rope us into these multi line expnsivve system, had I not already expensed the phone I would send it back based on this fact alone."
4,Great phone,"The phone is good, it just takes a little time to put the names and numbers in the phone book, other than that it's a great phone. I would recommend this phone to anyone the numbers are large enough for everyone to see. It looks great and would fit in any room."
4,Panasonic phone with anwsering system.,"This phone has many new features my previous phone did not have but some are missing. When calling by remote to check messages, I have to wait until it rings 4 times. Old phone allowed me to retrieve messages after 2 rings. Not willing to change ringer set up for home calls to accomodate this. Also, ringer is set at loudest, but it is difficult to hear from the next room. Why would they send a black charger when the phone is white??? Since I use it as a wall phone next to the outlet, the black charger is an eyesore. Haven't really had enough time to investigate other features."
3,Viewing Field,"ASIN:Panasonic KX-TS620W: This telephonse is working satisfactorily. The viewing screen is too small and the color makes it hard to read. To utilize the screen, one must pick up the entire phone and move it closer to one's eyes under an especially bright lamp. Though my wife has a hearing deficit, the volume control is adequate."
1,I would say don't bother,"If it lived up to all of the specifications in the description, this might be a decent phone. The caller ID is useless as the screen is too small and all but invisible under all but optimal lighting conditions and good vision. If you did not get all the info from the message playback the first time, too bad, its gone. It could be a little more user friendly in the playback instructions. A couple times I have had wicked echos when calling home from work to leave a message. I don't quite understand this but my wife says the handset is made of an odd kind of plastic that results in disturbing banging noises when used by women with earrings. If it was still within the return period, it would be. Since it is not, it will soon be finding a new home in my electronics recycle box."
2,not easy to put together ...,the drive works greats ... but to put together the cheap plastic enclosure it'sanother story ... the screw holes are not large enough and missaligned.the price is too much for such low quality.
1,a waste of money,i bought the spoon thinking that i would use it with my other 2 products of calphalon i purchased. the spoon handle is very long and looks very out of place when used with my 2 1/2 qt. saucepan & 3 qt. saucepot. it is so big that when i try to use it the spoon almost fell out of the pan. it has a very odd shape and style and i havent used it more than once. i would not recommend it to anyone.
2,dissapointing,"not what i expected, wolfie doest talk hardley at all just the same old oldies without that cool wolfman jack voice. not worth it."
3,"Useful, but disappointing","I was frustrated using this book (the 2008 edition). The descriptions didn't always convey what I thought they should have (is an okonomiyaki restaurant ""plebeian"" when it is covered with prayer cards with pervy drawings on the walls, and a geisha mannequin at each table?), the maps were confusing (I swear one temple is put in two different places on two maps), and the walking tours were a little frustrating. One starts off at a chain hotel, which is ""near"" a pedestrian underpass. I walked out of the subway station, immediately saw the pedestrian underpass but figured that couldn't be the one in question, so I walked up the hill to the product placement hotel instead. Of course, I should have just used the one across from the underpass.That said, I couldn't have seen anything without it. I chose this guide, because I wanted one for just Kyoto, and not all of Japan. Don't know if others are any better. Have a great trip!"
1,Turned itself inside out on a still day the first time I opened it,"The title speaks, I think, for itself. The canopy is thin, the shaft and ribs are flimsy.I tried to return it and the seller replied that opening it constituted using it and refused to refund the purchase and insisted I would have to accept an exchange. No, thank you.Do yourself a favor and buy something else."
5,life saver!,"I have 3 of these for my rabbits and they are truly lifesavers, they eat a lot and these can hold and keep dry a tonof food for at least 3 days between feedings!"
5,Great product,I have a few of these and work so well for my rabbits. I can fill this up and it lasts them about week.
5,buy it!!!!,"it is a great product. cuts through even the toughest stems like a blade. i like that it is non-aluminum since so much science has come out reveling how harmful aluminum is for us. its magnetic top works and holds great i even dropped it and the top didn't come off, yet it pulls off with almost no force. I have had many grinders like this and this is the best one i have owned. i will never waste $40 on a grinder again this is a great buy."
4,O.K BUY,"Its a good grinder but the screen is far to fine you can grind a forest B4 you start to see any real accumilation. However the numerous teeth and holes is a real treat.I did find however after extended use their does tend to get build up around the inner edge of the grinder thats hard to remove, this creates friction which makes it harder to grind."
5,Boyfriend LOVED it!,"My boyfriend and I definitely recommend this item! Works very well, extremely pleased! Grinds very smooth, and we especially love the ""keef"" scraper! Hah Shipping was ahead of time! Great item! YAY! Happy early Valentines Day everyone!"
1,Don't Follow Me,"""Experience (Follow Me)"" is a cutsie eurodance-ish tune with female vocals and piano accompaniment. It doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the album's mostly non-vocal aggressive techno style. I don't reccomend buying this album based on liking that one song."
5,Works as promised!,"Five star rating due to it's accurate description. Have used this in winds gusting to 45+ miles per hour and truly this umbrella had no problems. Fiberglass shaft means lightning strikes are unlikely and also makes for lightweight strength over metal umbrellas. Extra large diameter makes for comfortable sharing for two people and almost guarantees that your feet will stay dry. This exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend for couples that enjoy walks, rain or shine."
2,Not very useful as a camera,I bought 3 cameras to monitor my new-born but I was very disappointed by its visual performance. There is too much of delay and the quality of resolution very poor. As an intercom it is great.
3,Great Study,"I read portions of this book as part of a distant learning program for college 12 years ago and decided to review its contents recently. As part of my responsibilities in a Faith based Life Recovery Program I wanted to revisit its contents hoping to apply some of its suggestions. My only dissapointment is that it suggests that their is a Higher Force that exists but leaves it to the reader to discover or decide who or what you want that to be. If you ask today who is the God that the dollar bill refers to in the phrase"" In God we trust"", I believe you will have many different answers which few will recognize God of the Bible. However, it is a great study on defining stress and offers some great techniques on relieving and managing stress."
1,arrived scarred up,"When the product arrived, I was disappointed that the rubber coating over the metal framework was damaged (looked as though it had been sliced away with a knife) and there was rust on the metal underneath. I probably should have returned it, but for the price it wasn't worth the time and effort to repackage, pay postage and mail it back.And while the rack might be strong enough to hold a few chairs, the design requires that you bungie the rack to the ladder, and then bungie the chairs to the rack. After one short trip I took the rack off and simply bungied the chairs directly to the ladder. Works just as well."
5,More compliments than ever,"The prettiest black watch I have ever owned. The finish makes the watch. I receive compliments every where I go. Goes nicely with a suit or in the evening. Scratches a little around the face, but doesn't show. Maintains its luster. Always looks sharp!"
3,it's alittle spooky but somehow it's not what i expected.,"First of all why is it so dark? i have to switch from flahlight to a weapon and then switch back whats up with that? i enjoy this game even if there was alot of draw back, but i must admitt that it's creepy at times, i expected more and i felt that the graphic was good the environment was realistic, the audio good, but the technology hmmmmmmm gun without light ect............i think that the shot gun was almost useless compared to the original doom, well lets not be too critical, all in all i wanted more and expected more,this definitely a good game it may not have much replay value but it's worth the ride well later folks"
2,No belt loops!,"The robe isn't bad, especially for the money. But I was expecting it to have loops for the belt. It has none so you have to put the belt in the pocket (or somewhere else) when you take it off or hang it. This little oversight may not have seemed like much to the company, but it makes a big difference to me."
4,Terrycloth robe,Plenty big for me but I am a small framed woman so don't know how the one size would work for all. Fabric is very good quality and absorbent...just what I was looking for. Very pleased.
4,Well worth reading,Author has a lot of experience. Excellent book for newbies and more experienced alike. Well worth the money. Will remain in my boat library.
1,better books out there,"I have read a few books on the subject, mostly addressed to living on a sailboat, and this is like most of them, ignoring the differences from the costs and realities of living aboard a power or sailboat. Amazon sells an e-book that is actually as it gives a step by step review of both types(sail and power) and the costs, expectations and other things to consider before and after making the decision."
5,Excellent,This book is an excellent resource worth much more than the price. I've read a few books on this subject and this is by far the best. We are in the process of looking for our live aboard boat. We feel we have a better understanding of what we need and what we want since reading what the Neele's had to say. I enjoyed the different viewpoints from all the family members. Highly recommended!
2,Sometimes you get what you pay for,"I bought this phone because I didn't want any of the features that you find on more expensive phones, and because it is just a phone --- no answering machine included.However, the incoming and outgoing voice qualities are poor; everything is muffled.Also, the range isn't very good; I have a small house and the voice quality gets noticeably worse when I'm on a different floor than the base station.On the plus side, it does actually work. But I wouldn't want to talk to anybody on it for more than 5 minutes."
3,Same as before,"I really like this book. But I have a problem with it being almost exactly the same as the year before, and the year before that, and the year before that........ They need to get diffrent student opinions and go to more colleges"
5,Strongly Recommended,"Wow, what a great introduction to selling on eBay. There are definitely some really impressive ideas here that I am glad I learned. I definitely recommend this one for all eBay sellers.While this book does not dwell on technical details it does deliver by offering useful selling guidance that every eBay seller can use to further enhance their business and make money with.I also liked Secrets of eBay by Donny Lowy."
5,Perfect if you want to start an eBay business,"I read your book ""The Truth About E-Bay on the advice of another and found that it is amazing. I have never considered myself a business person but found your book so clear and so informative that I would consider trying selling on e-bay myself. I have perused a number of these types of books before but they are all vague and don't give the practical guidance I would need. Your book is very different. Thank you for all the obvious effort you put into it."
3,Worst. Cover art. Ever.,This crappy cover (and its non sequitur title) serve only to frighten Photoshop enthusiasts from the completely usable content within.
2,Calphalon Complements Nylon Tongs,"I purchased this thinking it would go with my Calphalon One Nonstick Cookware and also along with my other Calphalon utensils. Little did I know that this is not the high quality, sturdy pair of tongs that I had expected it to be, considering it's made from Calphalon. When you press the handles together to pick up something, the handles bend outwards making it very hard to grab onto something. I am probably going to buy those other popular pair of tongs which I see all the chef's using on Food Network."
2,Not the best of Judas Priest,"I'm a Judas Priest fan and own many of their albums but British Steel has always bugged me. The songs are not bad and the album did produce two of their biggest hits in Breaking The Law and Living After Midnight. But there is no energy to this album as if Judas Priest was just going through the motions of recording. Absent are the emotions of Stained Class and the power of Hell Bent For Leather and the angst of Screaming For Vengeance. Because of this the songs all blur together with none of them being a standout...making British Steel a very forgettable album. If you are new to Judas Priest, or are looking to finish your collection, I'd skip British Steel and move on to better efforts by the band like Stained Class, Hell Bent For Leather, Point Of Entry, Screaming For Vengeance, and Painkiller."
2,A Disappointed Lemper Fan,"I discovered Ute Lemper years ago and love her interpretations of Weill's unique music. However, I was sadly disappointed with this DVD for two reasons. Firstly, Lemper's approach to the music is as much acting as singing, therefore the lack of English titles is unforgivable. Trying to watch/listen to her performance while reading the translation from a booklet simply does not cut it. Secondly, although the piano accompaniment was first rate, it definitely wasn't ""piano"" but drowned out Lemper's singing in the softer passages. The production could have used a better sound engineer.The Michael Nyman section was just plain awful. The orchestral ""overture"" sounded like a noisy Phillip Glass knock off. The songs were repetitive and boring, lacked any kind of original musical ideas, and used Holocaust photos to (unsuccessfully) add ""gravitas"". I'd rather stick pins in my eyes than to experience that travesty again."
2,Wajda on Film,"This book was not very useful for me.It's hard to understand what reader category it's aiming for.I couldn't find any interesting thoughts or suggestions on how to make a film. Overall, it is very poorly written and doesn't meet the expectations I had for this book written by such a good film director as Wajda."
3,Very Relistic,"I like this book not much, but the way it's discribing Claud was fantastic. Also the new girl. She was like Claud so much that Claud can't resist her. The new girl was named Ashley. she puts down the baby-siter's club! These are rude things to do.Claud needs to do something that she can already do when the first fight of her and the baby-siter's club started. Can she? Or is it too late?"
2,Not for bottle liners,"We have been using the bottle warmer and have found that it works best for regular botles, not ones with the bottle liners. The milk gets too hot with a four ounce bottle. It is fine for warming 8 ounce bottles. We've used plastic bootles as well as the little glass distilled water bottles and they seem to heat okay. I always stand right by the warmer and usually take it out before the timer goes off."
4,A little tricky - but pretty handy,"We had to fiddle with finding the right water levels for different bottle types and feed amounts (disposable vs. reusable and 4 oz. vs. 8 oz). On average, we use less water than it suggests. Once you get the hang of it - it's a great item. This warmer heats feeds quicker than the 5 minutes it advertises and the automatic shut-off is great!"
2,Does not last long,"We bought this about 6 weeks ago, and it has already stopped beeping when the nipple is sterlised or milk is warm. Now the markings on its measuring cup is coming off.Basically, I believe Minchkin has cut corners with poor quality product. Not recommended at all...I would prefer some other brand."
1,NOT SAFE!!!,"I bought two of these. One for home, one for work (my baby comes with me). The one at home stopped shutting off automatically after just one week of use, and the one at work gets the bottles SO hot, even though I follow the directions to the letter, and it literally boiled the formula. Between not turning itself off, and boiling things, there is no way i want one in my house. I am returning them both."
4,Good Movie,"This movie is great if you either understand Korean or don't mind R-language subtitles. The plot was really good and they couldn't have picked a more attractive girl to play the leading role. I don't understand why the people that do the subtitles for these things though, don't use a little more mild language. This was a movie obviously targeted towards a more family audience with no innapropriate scenes while still managing to have a great love story. Why do they have to put f words into the English subtitles in every other sentence?But like I said, if you don't mind that kind of language or understand Korean, this was an awesome movie. Great story, great characters and really funny, even though it was in another language."
4,thanks,i got it very fast and it work good if i need more things i will check with there site friist
3,It was okay...,"I thought it would really inspire me but it wasn't a bad reading. I would call it ""Chicken Book for the RA Soul."""
3,Mediocre,"Reasonably useful but range less than I would have expected. Usability issue: not suitable for carrying in a pack or pocket while getting jostled about: push-button turn-on means it constantly goes on by itself, nearly impossible to prevent, and annoying beep-beep when you press a button while keys are locked means it's constantly beeping at you for no useful reason. When I travel I have to remove the batteries to prevent it from turning on in my suitcase. Also provided rechargeable batteries worked great the first few times, but within a few months of infrequent use completely failed to hold a charge. Good thing it takes AA's."
2,"This was my 1st digital camera, moved on to a better camera","I owned this camera for 1 year and shot at least 1200 pictures. Since it was my 1st I did not know what I was missing. It doesn't operate quickly. Because of a delay between flash and picture taking, my subjects always moved believing it had taken the picture when it actually didn't take it for a second after. Imagine those shots! Also, a delay in trying to take 2 or more pix right after another. Had many wait times. Not fun when you're trying to capture that shot! Also, burns thru batteries often. And there is no audio on the movie fuction.My camera was just stolen on vacation, so I went shopping for a new one. I got a newly refurbished Sony Cybershot dsc-w100 with 8.1 mega pixels one at [...]for [...] and it completey out performs the coolpix. Great shots, low light, user friendly, and movie with sound so far. Off to get that perfect shot!"
4,Good choice,"This camera is worth every penny. I just recieved it today and so far I like it a lot. Seems to be well made, has a nice size LCD screen, and takes good pictures from what I have seen so far. Battery life seems good. It has 15 scene modes which you would not expect with a camera in it's price range. Macro mode is excellent! The only downsides really is the time it takes from when you take a picture to the time you can take the next, it takes a second for the flash to charge. The camera only comes with 10mb internal memory, so unless you are going to invest in a bigger memory card, you will only be able to take about 6 pictures. The video mode is good, but does not have any sound. Overall I give it a 4.5. Price paid: $116"
2,"Two stars, more than fair.","Giving this item two stars is more than fair. Every once in a while you will get a good picture, but most of the time the picture is no good. With the flash on, objects in the picture are really white-ed out making color washed out and people super pale. With the flash off everything is super blurry. Also, if you take a video THERE IS NO SOUND!"
5,Plate holder,"This plate holder works good. We use this in our house, it keeps the counters from being cluttered. It is easy to fill this with plates, and it holds up well."
3,Not bad if trying to save space,"Honestly, I bought this just because it was inexpensive and space is scarce in my small Truck Camper. It does not fit all paper plate sizes. It does work and it is easy to install. However it does require you to put screws into your ceiling."
4,Is as expected,It is what it is :) It holds my paper plates underneath my cabinets. No complaintes to be found here.
5,Works great!,"I put a piece of this carbon on top of the mechanical sponge in aHagen Elite Underwater Mini Filter, UL Listedand within 5 days, it reduced the ammonia level in my betta's tank by 1 ppm.The description states that this is 1"" in height, but it's 1/2 an inch. I think because it comes folded in half that they say it's 1"".ADDED 2/24/13:I've started using this in my Marineland Penguin Biowheel filter in addition to the carbon that the filter comes with. I was finally able to get my balloon molly's tank ammonia level down by 0.25 ppm in less than a week."
4,It's a good price for the product,I got alot of these for 2 dollars shipping was fast. I thought the product could have been a little better manufactured in regards to thickness.
4,Some real review,"I purchased this book for 70-058 exam preparation and I think it was a good choice. I bought two books on the same subject (SAMS > NetEss in 14 days and ExamCram > NetEss) and when I took some online tests I recognized that wasn't prepared enough. Why York's book is better? Well, I think it's written pretty clear language and includes the exact info you would need to pass the exam ( you have about two month to do so from the present day ). I can't recommend this book as the ONLY source for preparation but it also helped me much. Worst the money and definitely deserves 4 stars. Hope you'll pass with score like mine. Good luck !"
3,It's a great book!,It's a great book! You never seem to know what to except. It's well-written and inspiring.
5,an excellent hub,"This is an excellent hub. I have mine on the floor and use all 7 usb ports without the power supply. It may need the power supply for some applications but I'm running a Canon printer, Casio camera dock, H4150 ipaq cradle, a card reader, and a mouse. I have my 8gb Lexar drive plugged in the top.This is as good as it gets. Recommend"
3,slow read,"This book really had a hard time getting my attention. It took many tries for me to get into it but I did finally finish it. It started way to slow but then the story line picked up about half way through the book. I have another in this series but keep pushing it the back of my ""shelf""."
2,Not my favorite book,"I made two of the shoes, was tedious, but worked. Shoes are all old fashioned and I wanted newer dated shoes."
2,Beauty and the Beast...,"I don't particularlly like beauty and the beast story lines and I didn't enjoy the book because of it. The hero wasn't very appealing to my senses. The writing is well done and the unconventional un-pc hero was fun for a while, but I wasn't interested in him enough as a hero to really appreciate the book fully. Hopefully I'll have better luck with my next VH. 2.5 stars"
4,"Great ideas, but...","The gift ideas are great...however, it's time consuming to browse through so many gifts each time a special occasion comes along.For me, it's faster to use Surprise.com or the ""Gift Ideas"" area of Amazon.com."
3,Surprise.com works for me,Its much easier to sue a Web site like Suprise.com than to thumb through a book. Thanks for the recommendation. I really liked the Surprise.com.
2,The knife is dull after about 20 uses,"I have the entire Twin signature series set and this knife runs dull fast. I sharpen the knife at least twice a month and it still runs dull. Pass on this little guy and go to the 6"" utility."
4,George Morgan: Colony Builder,"For those who want to learn more about what was happening west of the Allegheny Mountains at the time of the Revolutionary War, this little book is an eye-opener. Included are appeasement of the Indian tribes, and competition among the French, the Spanish, and the British for the fur trade. I don't remember learning anything about this in American history class, not even in college!"
1,What a waste of money.,"I was expecting this book to contain some reasoned and valid insight into the gun control debate. Instead it was filled with fear-mongering rhetoric, expressed in a very disorganized and shoddy fashion. It was not a measured comment on guns and their roles in protecting and ensuring the security of Americans. It was a shambolic series of shrill letters and rambling essays. J Neil Schulman seems to continually deliver his message with a ball hammer, where for this sensitive issue, a scalpel was needed.Lastly, how hard it is to proof read your manuscript, Mr Schulman? There were so many typos in this mess that had I corrected them all with a red pen, I would have run out of ink.Not recommended, even at the reduced price."
3,Funnels,"The Funnels are ok. For solid materal, they tend to clog. The flat space between the top part of the funnel and the bottom part, appears to be the problem. For liquids they work great, but you need a pot holder for hot liquids."
4,hard to find funnels. these are nice,"We had one metal funnel for years and it got old and I needed it for garage use.I assumed I could just buy a replacement, but I was wrong. I searched in several supermarkets and kitchen stores and couldn't find anything - let alone a selection.So, I was thrilled when I found this set at Amazon.I purchased them and am happy with one exception.....They seem well made. They have a system to hold them together so they don't get lost. Having 3 sizes is great.But, they are smaller than I imagined. My bad! The dimensions were clearly shown - I just didn't check. But, they weren't expensive and we can use them and I just purchased a larger funnel."
3,Stainless steel funnels,"I like the funnels and the fact that they are stainless, but when I got them and saw how tiny they were, I was disappointed. I didn't realize they'd be so small. Regardless, I will find a use for them."
2,Not what I expected,I was expecting these funnels to be much larger than they were. Not sure what we will use these very small Funnels for.
2,Disappointed,Arrived in reasonable time; well packaged. BUT the funnels themselves: too small.Great for a play kitchen but not for every day real use.
3,Very Small,"Very good material, looks sturdy enough. Don't think it worth the money to get this set. Like others has mention, very small."
2,Only Buy This Set if You Want Miniature Funnels for Specialty Tasks,These are NOT regular size funnels. They are minature funnels for specialty tasks such as filling up very small necked bottles/containers. Nowhere did I see this important detail in the description
3,Like nothing I've read before!,"It was fun reading this book, I got to choose my own adventure, unfortunately, some of the choices I made were the wrong ones. This is the kind of book you can read without taking it seriously, it is not a story and you can't read it from beginning to end. It is different from everything I've read before. Buy this book and read it while you in a plain or bus, the time will fly because you'll be too caught up on the funny situations and choices you'll have to make!"
1,Do NOT read it if you are shy,"I read this book while in college in the 1980's, after seeing and hearing several recommendations. I was quite shy before, but reading it really increased the problem. Also, forget about psychologists, psychiatrists, etc. I have yet to meet one who knows anything about people. There are drugs that are supposed to help as well, but they actually have no positive effects.Instead, get involved in social activities along with friends - in my case, it was ballroom dancing with group lessons that helped. I'm still shy, but not as painfully shy."
4,Good book Easy to Read,"A good book that is easy to read. I had to read a book for a psychology class from a list in our book. This was one that wasn't written like a report or a text book. I was filled with lots of information that related to me, and has helped give me ideas of how to over come my shyness."
4,Outdated but still the best,"Being a true-blue shy person, I've ordered every book on shyness I could find. This author seems to be the only one who really knows what he's talking about. The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's outdated. The only thing that has changed since I bought this book 10 years ago is it's cover."
1,Haven't we come further?,"As a parent and teacher it breaks my heart to know that anyone who is labeled as shy would read this book and think there is something psychologically wrong with them that needs to be fixed. Modern society and the educational system focus way too much on extroverted preferences and performance. So many productive, intellectual, insightful people are introverts who prefer to be in social situations that don't demand that we be something that we are not, extroverted. Shyness is a label given to those who don't fit into the behavioral expectations of extroverted parents, teachers, and bosses. We would not be where we are in civilized history without inwardly focused thinkers, writers and problem solvers. We used to call quiet, reserved, thinking people wise, now we call them shy, lacking in self-esteem and not team players. Not only is the book outdated, so is the term shy and so are the expectations that everyone in school and society should fit into the same mold."
4,1O of the greatest gospel songs.,"The reason I could not give this collection 5 stars is because it'snamed Gospel's Top 20 songs of the century and omits too many artists and styles of gospel music. Where is Mahalia Jackson?Where are the Mighty Clouds of Joy? How about Kirk Franklin,Yolanda Adams, the Soul Stirers? It should only be one disc,the songs on disc 2. To their credit, these appear to be the original artists singing their songs.But it should be called ""Gospel Pioners"" without the number 20."
5,Who but lovable ol' Pogo with the soft brown eyes,Witty word plays and the sagacity of swamp critters; Walt Kelly's masterpiece re-edited for our delight by the good folks at Fantagraphics (God bless'em).
5,"Oh, I love this stuff!!","My hubby is an Old Spice guy and I love it! This stuff smells so good. The scent lasts all day long too. He thinks I am wierd because I always want to smell his armpits! OK, I guess it really is a little wierd, but I just love the smell of this stuff! I can't get enough. All of the Old Spice products are wonderful in my opinion. Hubby has used all the different varieties of the Old Spice body washes and deodorants and they all just smell so good and the scent is there all day even though it is not too strong. I just love this stuff! If hubby ever decides to switch products, I just might have to file for divorce!"
4,Haunting Memories,This is a very good book. It keeps you interested in every chapter. At first you will think it is just another mystery book. It gets you involved where you can't put it down after you start reading it.
1,Worthless garbage,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE. IT HAS NO VALUE AT ALL WHATSOEVER. IT CHANGES COLORS THROUGHOUT VIDEOS AND THE PICTURE WARPS THROUGHOUT THE VIDEO. IT BEST DOES LIGHT OUTSIDE, AND STILL DOES EXTREMELY BAD. THIS ""CAMERA"" IS NOT EVEN WORTH ONE CENT. IT IS CERTAINLY NOT ""GR8"". IT IS LIKE A NOVELTY TOY AND DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE SOLD AT 60+ DOLLARS. PLEASE HEED THIS WARNING!"
3,Appreciate your ski patrol,"I read ""Emeralds in the Snow"" right after reading ""Appalachian Paradise"" and found ""Emeralds..."" to be a vastly more interesting book. I love mysterious anything! The prologue does a good job of setting up how and why the story unfolds.I found the first few chapters a bit sappy but I am a fan of mystery not romance so my opinion reflects that preference. For the most part, the story flows well and keeps the reader interested.As the story concludes I was left wondering why, with the rediscovery of an emeralld mine on family property, there were still financial concerns. The mine had once provided millions, why not again?Tne author does a good job of describing the beginning ski experience and give an informative, appreciative look into the world of Ski Patrol."
5,genius air fighter,I have finished in three days. The book is excellent. Marseille left great impression to me not as only virtuoso air fighter but as a great human person as well. Maseille's great spirit is whole involved here. I can fully recommend to those who have not read this book yet.
5,Major paradigm upheaval--Great stuff for the open mind,Suares pulls back the veil of the Bible. This book is not for the faint of heart or he who seeks security in the status quo. Finally the bible makes sense to the one who is only slightly aware. The work penetrates time and space.
2,very average,Richard Pryor is the Greatest Comdian of All-Time to me.but this material from him lags and misses the mark at times.his stand up concerts would get better.
2,just not really funny,"If you aren't really into jokes about the difference between black/white, sex, drugs and how bad gays are this is not for you.I had seen other stuff by Pryor I always liked but this time I never once really laughed out loud. It was dissapointing, good thing he has so many other good stuff"
5,Richard Pryor live,Excellent video.and want to collect all of his stand up vids but cannot find it in England.I like to find them in English format video or DVD
2,A very disappointing book: extremely complicated,"Christian Gouriéroux is maybe the best French econometrician. In particular, his last discovery, the indirect inference, seems to be a very clever way of solving the problem of highly complicated likelihood functions. But in this book, only 4 pages are dedicated to present the subject, and they are filled with over complicated mathematical formulas and a very short explanation. The notations are extremely complicated for economists (at least for myself) and, if you don't have a very solid mathematical background, you'll feel lost from the beginning until the last one. Nor undergraduate economics students neither graduate applied econometricians should feel comfortable with the style of the book. I guess only professional researchers are aimed by this book. It's rather disappointing, because the array of subjects are very interesting and the author is a great econometrician."
3,Wish I had bought a wide-screen monitor instead,"This set seems much bigger than its 3'x2' footprint would suggest. It weighs 160 pounds.Although this appears to be HD-ready nothing in the documentation mentions HDTV (or HD, or ""high definition"") at all - the only assurance that I have that this set is HD-ready is the list of features on the outside box.In general, the documentation that comes with this set is atrocious. There is a pamphlet that is supposed to be a ""quick"" setup guide, and there is a larger user manual that ONLY discusses the use of the remote. There is no diagram anywhere that identifies all of the numerous sockets on the back of the TV.I managed to hook up my Samsung DVD player with component output, and I love the quality of the image in 16x9 aspect ratio, but I wish I had bought one of the wide-screen sets they are now selling."
5,Boy oh Boy,"This new author came out with a bang!!! Everyone has girlfriends like this. I started this book at 11pm and did not stop until 4:00am. It has a wonderful story line, it is exciting, humorous and truly romantic. Carita has done a wonderful job of displaying the roles of men and women in society today. Keep up the good work Carita and I can not wait for the next one."
1,Just awful.,"I watched this movie based on the positive reviews on this site, but was very disappointed. I found the acting, directing and storyline to be atrocious. I kept holding out that the movie would improve, but it never did. It was successful to some extent in portraying the brutality of the war on the Eastern front, but the awful acting and directing almost blunted that one point. I am usually easy to please when it comes to films, but this offered nothing. I would not waste your time on this one."
1,I kept waiting for the action...,"but it never came... very slow pace movie, I could barely stay awake. Why would anyone give this a 5 star? There are so many better movies that tell the same story with a lot more action. It's like all the scenes just dragged on forever... make the point and move on. It's like the story was never really developed - plot is weak. They could have centered the movie around some famous battle and still showed the harshness of life. I just rented it from amazon and it was not worth even $3."
3,Lapses into Melodrama,"The person deserving the most praise in this movie is the cinematographer A. Rodionov. His use of natural light to create moods and his fluid, dynamic following of the choreography of crowd scenes is mostly what kept my interest in the film. The story itself starts out okay but as soon as the first Nazis arrive Klimov begins making his point with a bludgeon. The acting of the film's hero, Florya, is way overdone and Klimov evidently wasn't sure the viewer would get any point unless it was made for at least three times as long as necessary. The result is bombast that diminishes the impact of its message about Nazi atrocities rather than enhances it. Kind of disappointing because underneath all the melodrama there are the seeds of a truly disturbing, realistic portrayal of the subject matter."
2,I can see where they're coming from...,lots of great reviews about this movie so i bought it. I guess for its time I can appreciate it and what its trying to convey. But its one of those movies that could have been 45 minutes shorter and still convey just as strongly its message. But over all worth that once over.
3,Good,"It's ok, but not very practical as it is Harvey Mackay's ""Dig your well first"". Not very exciting, a little bit boring"
4,Some excellent take-aways,"I'll keep this short and just simply state that there are some real gems in this book. Simple take-aways that are worth knowing (and implementing) that will serve you for a lifetime. In my opinion, these little gems are well worth the price of the book."
1,What a disappointment,"I have read most of the Ciampi/Karp series and have noticed that the last few books have been steering further and further away from the mainstream. The books are getting so far out that I do not believe I will read the next one. I remember Hitchcock talking about suspense. He talked about 'the bomb'. If you just blow the bomb up then the impact is a sudden shock. If you show the bomb and show the bomb, you create suspense. But you can never blow up the bomb because the audience will never forgive you. Tanenbaum shows the bomb and shows the bomb and then blows up the bomb. Hitch was right."
3,Not the best collection,I borrowed this CD from the local library. I have recently been collecting celtic music and thought I'd try borrowing a few before buying. This collection is ok but not the best celtic music you will find. The first track is ok (very Mike Oldfield) apart from the pipes hitting bum notes and track 10 is nice. Apart from that I wasn't really drawn in.If you want a really good celtic musical experience try Medwyn Goodall - you will not need to look much further.
4,Anti-Breakage Conditioner,"I tried this product along with the shampoo from the same brand, and it's a very good conditioner. Not only it conditions my hair, but also prevents it from split end and breakage. After using this product, it's easy to brush your hair and style it the way you want to. It's also inexpensive and is sold in any drugstore. The fact that it also has Vitamin B12 and Gelatin is great. It's a good treat for your hair."
4,A must have for fans of the vampire genre.,"This is a must buy and well worth the money.It is, by far, the best vampire series I have ever seen.Others just don't measure up.Mark Frankel's acting was surpurb in his portrail of Julian Luna.The viewer can empathize with his charactor; The constant struggle between surpressing his human desires while ruthlessly fulling his duties as Prince of the City.Offset by the other main charactors in the series and their scenerios, this makes for one of the most entertaining and spell binding soap operas /series yet!Watching the entire vampire collection [which consist of 8 shows]left me 'thirsty' for more with a sadness that there will never again be another charactor like Julian Luna!Any producer would be hard-pressed to find another actor who could so sucessfully portray the charactor of Julian Luna as Mark Frankel did,may he rest in peace."
3,Typical for it's time period,"I remembered this series being better when I first watched it on TV. I forgot how ""cheesy"" it was, but for under 10 bucks it was an ok diversion."
1,Sterling silver bracelet with moon slide.,"If infants could wear jewelry, this would be appropriate. It is so tiny you almost have to use a magnifier to see it. Veru close to invisible."
3,Not quite as advertised,"I recently bought this sleeve from a seller for .99 advertising it as ""leather"" when in fact it is not. It seems it is the same PVC sleeve that is initially given with the product. I've owned my current leather wallet for a few years- I've owned this sleeve for a few months and it's already splitting down the back like my original one.So beware- it may say leather, but in all actuality..."
5,Geo Metro Mirror,Looks like original. Installation was easy. Was a little sceptical on how it would fit and look. Quite happy with it. Thought it was a little pricy but worth it.
1,Aweful,"A truly aweful CD. I meant to buy something else and when I put this in my CD player, I just cringed. I know a lot about trance music and goa-trance and this is NOT IT. If you are going to listen to trance either buy reputable Goa or buy a great DJ like Sasha or Paul Oakenfold. If you want drum&bass go for DJ DB. BUT DON'T Buy this CD. PS. I have no idea what the other reviewer was thinking. This CD is TRULY TERRIBLE."
1,Amazon Bug.,"My UNBOX player would not play this video; it would hang each time I clicked play. I would like to get some tech support or at least be sure that I didn't pay for it, the title looks attractive.Did anyone get this to play? Post your review, I think it would not play for anyone, even the TiVo folks.O. Henry A Life in Stories"
3,GustBuster Umbrella,"I used the Spectator Seat Umbrella for Yak races in Thailand, the sun is very strong there so I needed something, I thought it would be good with a built in seat. The price is very steep, didn't seem that sturdy and my Umbrella was damaged by a few hoof kicks so it was torn. It's probably better to get a little chair and a cheaper GustBuster Umbrella."
1,Cheerleader,"This author is a well-known academic cheerleader for Disney who once again, doesn't disappoint. The architecture of Disney's theme parks is copied, gaudy, and in some ways, cheesy. And yet she calls it the ""architecture of reassurance.'' How does it reassure? While she gives herself away in the subtitle, I would only concur that this author should be writing press releases for Michael Eisner rather than passing herself off as a professor and academic. If you gush over Disney, buy the book. If you're looking for insights, don't."
2,Not what I expected,"This isn't a bad book, it has lots of pretty pictures, but it's just not the in-depth, detailed, behind-the-scenes look at the parks that I'd hoped for. It's more of a skim over the surface of the history of the parks. Overall, a disappointment."
1,One of the Worst Movies Ever!!!,"Wow, this movie was absolutely terrible. I felt like I was being punished by watching this. I couldn't even make it past 30 minutes. The first 7 minutes is just full frontal naked women dancing. Then you have a skeleton with the thorny crown Jesus wore on the cross stalking these naked women and sucking the life out of them. I'm a Christian and hate when people spoof Jesus. I would never ever under any circumstances recommend ZOMBIECHRIST!!!"
1,Botched,"Make no mistake, I love EXPRESSO BONGO, and the film itself would normally merit five stars; for style and sensibility, it was ahead of the curve for 1959. Watching this version of it, however, gives the false impression that this is just another teen idol film, due primarily to the several excised musical interludes. Of course, my own discovery of the missing Harvey numbers was upsetting, but by far the biggest letdown was the absence of Meier Tzelniker's peculiar performance of a charming number called ""Nausea,"" the strangest moment in the film and biggest disappointment of this edition. Kino is generally one of the few labels I would buy from sight unseen, but this gives me cause for concern..."
1,Do not waste your money,"I bought this CD thinking it was a mix of the original people. I was mistaken. Some of the songs were okay, but if you had heard them before, the remakes are very bad. If I had known that these were not the original singers, I would not have wasted my money on it."
1,yuck,"It's a mini mouse pad! Don't buy it unless you want a nice rug for your mouse.I originally ordered a 10 foot by 8 foot area rug for my basement and I got this 10 inch by 8 inch mini rug. The pictures on Amazon were miss leading. Just goes to show you, let the buyer beware!"
2,Why does this exist?,"Firstly, let me clarify that this one star does not reflect my opinions on Patrick Doyle's original compositions for the Goblet of Fire, or any part of the Harry Potter series. But I don't know why this CD exists, because it has no purpose in life.For those not in the know, 'Global Stage Orchestra' is just a bunch of computers reproducing inferior synthesised renditions of their counterparts. While the original counterparts are world class compositions, performed by professional musicians on real instruments, Global Stage Orchestra just pops sheet music into a computer and robs the music of its integrity.Two stars from me, one because that's the lowest grade you can give on Amazon, one for Doyle's original score. Boycott this rubbish and buy the realHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]!"
4,A good video to use during the winter months...,"A good video to use during the winter months, but I prefer the RIDES North Carolina video better.Its definitely a good video for use with a spinner and helps maintain athletic motivation."
5,A unique planning aid,"Although out of print and out of date, this is still a superb and unparalleled picture guide to the terrain of New Zealand. The mountains, coasts, and parklands it covers should be essentially unchanged since the publication date of 1982. The copious and excellent photo coverage is beautifully organized with thunmbnail locater maps on every two page spread to help you pinpoint the areas that look most interesting for a visit."
2,HO Ore Load Cars (4),"I purchased this item thinking that 4 Ore cars were included in the set. I received just the Ore loads - no cars. The photo and description are misleading by stating ""HO ORE LOAD: WKA ORE CARS (4)"". I just want to caution everyone to notice the word ""Load"" on any of these CHOOCH Enterprises products. That is the key word meaning you are purchasing the load only and the cars are not included. To be more descriptive the information should state ""load only - cars not included""."
2,Missing Part,"The gun and package deal are great, however the advertisement from Pyramid Air is mis-leading. It did not come with the safety glasses (but did include a carrying case). The seller was no help in providing the missing piece."
4,Tough plants for tough places,We have such extremes of climate in the Midwest that it can be frustrating knowing what to grow. This book not only recommends varieties but also covers pests and diseases we face in our areas.
1,Try and get the 1st one.,"This one is ok, but needs the adapter. I prefer the first one Belkin released. I have the cassette adaptor and cup holder in my Honda Civic. Works like a charm. !!!STAY AWAY from the FM transmitters.!!! I find them (I bought the one from Belkin and Griffen) both to be a waste of money...interference, static, etc...it defeats the whole purpose of digital music: clarity."
3,not built to last,"The product is very useful as long as it works. Less than one year after I got it, it stopped charging. Its become very loose, and unless i keep it pushed in by hand (impractical while driving) it doesnt charge."
2,cheaply made but did the job,"only for older gen ipods, feels like it will fall apart at any minute but must admit it did not."
4,Best deal in town FREE SHIPPING too!,"Best bargain in Town($3.oo),used my FREE SHIPPING option on other items and got all shipped together for FREE! Real inexpensive price it seems to work fine.Griffin makes other good products for APPLE,so I feel confident with this brand and not some generic knock off.Good Luck,Emilio."
5,I love watching the Huxtable family,"I loved watching this show when it was first on, and I enjoy watching it again. The Huxtable family is heartwarming, charming, and real."
3,"Works well..but DOESN""T LAST!",If you want something to work for only a year then this is the machine for you! Me AND my mom have both burned through 2 a piece in the last 2 years. These units work great and are truly brag worthy while they last...but they just don't last long enough to account for the $130 your dropping on it! Just beware and be aware...sometimes I think it's better to have several devices instead of a 3 in 1 that dies in no time. Money down the drain.
3,Good source of ideas,"I have two Temari ball books; one by Diane V (for beginners) and this one. Some of the instructions are hard to follow; sometimes I looked at the pictures and guessed about what to do. There isn't a lot of detail about how to start or end a thread, how many wraps to make, when to change colors, etc. And a couple patterns seem to be missing steps. But if you've learned to make Temari balls already, this book has beautiful, inspiring designs. One comment on her technique is that she has you start with a polystyrene ball and cover it with thread (without a batting layer or a yarn layer). This is a very slow way to start! And I think the batting layer and thread layer help anchor the knots in the balls making the finished product more secure."
4,Learning Temari,I needed a book to help me with learning the techniques for this form of thread work. The photos of finished work are inspiring as well.
5,Well worth the price,"This book offers clear, easy to understand directions, great photos, and helpful tips and tricks into the world of temari. I have several other books by different authors and this is by far one of the most helpful of all! This book is well worth the money and great for beginner to intermediate temari makers."
2,Wonderful pictures but flawed directions,"If you expect to be able to make the exquisite designs show in Diamond's photos, you better be good at figuring things out for yourself. The directions prove to be inaccurate and sometimes the photo and instructions don't even match!"
1,Boring!,Im sorry it just must be me. i really coudnt get into this movie. it starts off slow and there is nothing in it that i find that interesting......didn't finish watching it..
4,Entertainment,"is what The Paper is all about. It's just . . . . entertaining. Yes, it raises a couple of ethical issues but Ron Howard never lets them derail the fun factor. Terrif cast, amusing characters and generally very well managed chaos.The 1.33:1 video format is a very strange choice but as far as I could tell it's not pan and scan. It's just unmatted, meaning you do see the whole picture from side to side but more than intended from top to bottom."
2,A movie about a,"bunch of jerks, except for the senior editor with cancer. It's just phony realism. I'm sure actual newspaper people are very nice."
5,Excellent Speakers for MP3 Player,"Really Cool. Satisfied in all aspects, Aesthetic Look is great. I like bass to be more for songs and these speakers produce amazing bass. These speakers rulled out the theory that in order to have more bass the speakers should be big.I got it in 20 $ on thanksgiving a great purchase at this price"
4,Got my product quick and I needed it,I love this product as its a great gainer that has a good taste .I have went through numerous tubs and tried a few different flavors and they were all good .Amazon provided me with a great deal and fast delivery .This was an all around good experience for me .
4,Good Start~,This book is great if you are at the beginning of your dissertation process. It is very informative! I would highly recommend!
3,Christmas Movies,"The first movie - Olden Days Coat was a bit bizarre. But the othere three movies were fine. Nice, made for TV types of movies to add to christmas collection."
3,Why?,"I don't understand why they would put ""The olden days coat"" movie in with the other 3...I was shocked and very disappointed...will be careful what kind of sets I buy anymore..some are worth taking the risk and others are not!"
3,"good ideas, too many words","I must disagree with the other reviewers of this series. I can't give this saga 5 stars.Although the idea is good, and there are a lot of good tricks, the saga as a whole is too long, too wordy, the writing too clipped and sometimes it curls in itself and is difficult to follow. I found the first two novels a bit boring and only ""the kif strike back"" seemed good enough in itself.Ms. Cherryh is obviously a talented writer, but the books would be better if the less interesting parts were culled, the unnecesary dialogs and descriptions erased, and if we got some real information about the characters and the plot.A bit more action would be welcome, too!"
2,alex,The game wasn't as updated as I thought it would be. The 2006 NHRA Championship Drag Racing game was more fun to play with the bounses for breaking ET and MPH records and also the tune with crew chief was more infromative. And I also like the match races. So all and all I give the new NHRA game 2 stars. Thanks Alex
2,Problem with Vista,Do extensive research on the internet first if you intend to purchase this product for Vista. Go to google and search for ABIT airpace vista. Was not able to successfully install mine as of the writing of this comment.
4,"cheap card with good reception, xp users MUST read","(...)I am using this card on old p3 laptopget good reception, and able to get up to 24M at lowbut xp users must read thisupon installation, the system may install the driver automatically, the driver is WRONG! this is for PCI version, will not work on the pc cardafter installation, you must update the driver with the one comes with CDafter that, it should be good to goand there's another benefit for 2 pc card slot laptop users: this card is thin enough to put another card on top of thisreception in kitchentrendware: good to lowMS MN-710: low to very low"
5,Great Read with an Interesting Twist at the End,"I listened to CONSENT TO KILL on CD and enjoyed the book and the actor who read it. I've only read a few Mitch Rapp novels, but I like him. He's a no-nonsense kind of guy and gets the job done without whining. In CONSENT TO KILL, he faces an assassin with skills equal to his own who makes the battle extremely personal. Vince Flynn leaves Rapp with a difficult choice at the end of the book, and Rapp comes through with his humanity intact.Definitely worth a read."
5,great series,Vince Flynn has a great series...I read them all! This one is more emotional than the others in the series.
5,Another thought-provoking novel,"I have grown to appreciate the thoughtfulness of Vince Flynn's storytelling and the heroism (perhaps a little over-the-top, but this is fiction) of Mitch Rapp. The sad thing is that the setting of the post-9/11 terrorist world is all too believable. Good job, as usual."
4,"Starts slow, good second half","The first half of this novel just dragged. I love Mitch Rapp, but I was bored. Then halfway through the book things get interesting. The second half was great--a typical exciting Mitch Rapp story. If you're reading the series, this is a must read because of certain events.***SPOILER***I almost gave it 5 stars, even though I didn't like the first half of the book, because he finally killed off Anna. She was extremely annoying and I'm glad she's finally gone!"
1,Adios Vince Flynn,"This is the second Vince Flynn book I couldn't get through. Memorial Day was great. Then, Term Limits was a disaster. Consent to Kill was absolutely atrocious. It seemed the entire book consisted of the assassins going back and forth trying to decide how much money they would get for killing Mitch Rapp. It read like drivel that Flynn put out to try and keep squeezing the Mitch Rapp machine. I've given him enough of my time. Mr. Flynn, I bid you farewell."
3,"Quick, Fun, and Predictable","Interesting enough, albeit very standard CIA-assassin-hell-bent-on-revenge stuff.Basically, the hero, Mitch Rapp, is a CIA assassin... um, ""counter-terrorism operative"" whose exposure by a rogue politician has led to the murder of his pregnant wife in what was meant as as an assassination attempt against him.Rapp is as unconsolable as you might expect, and proceeds to kill everyone that had anything to do with the murder.Not a challenging read... but you wouldn't read Vince Flynn's stuff if that is what you wanted.This was Flynn's fifth or sixth novel, all of which have Mitch Rapp as the central character. Fortunately Rapp has FINALLY gotten rid of, or at least isn't using his usual Beretta pistol, even though the FN Five-Seven is equally impractical as a concealed carry pistolIf you like shoot 'em ups with clearly defined good guys and bad guys, you might find this a pleasant way to spend a few hours.Not for the squeamish."
4,"Good book, lots of details","I found this book to be very detailed in its descriptions of the North, and liked the fact that it leaves a few mysteries and potentially interesting sites here and there for you to embellish yourself. In doing this, I think it does a good job of giving you lots of details without restricting you.The art and presentation are great. I liked the large fold-out map, however, I would have liked to have seen small shots of the relevant portions of that map in the ""Lay of the Land"" part of the text so that you could read the book without having to constantly refer to the large and unwieldy map. The map is nice and nicely done though, and I think it would be excellent for use in a game.Anyway, I'd give it 4 stars because it was everything I expected it would be, gave me all of the information I was looking to get out of it, and was well done. It didn't blow me away, but it's a solid book and well worth the money."
2,pink miss elaine,ordered this for mother inlaw I was told he was a 14 to 18 so look at size and ordered her the 2x she says its hugh 2 people could get into it the gown itself its nice she says its pretty just way to big
2,$6.95 shipping I will never get back,This nightgown is way too sheer to give as a Mother's Day Gift! The aqua is more green than blue. I ordered it because it is loose flowing so perfect for wide bodies.
1,Terrible Software,"The software application that comes with this adapter is very flaky. After I installed it, I started getting a login prompt after boot-up. And upon login, I always got 2 error pop-ups. After installing, the application always allowed me to configure the adapter, but after rebooting, the application no longer even functioned. I tried installing/uninstalling a few times to try different scenarios. One time I got a blue screen during uninstall.I guess I should not have ignored the Windows warning that this software did not pass the Windows logo test. I'm returning this product."
2,Good budget choice but unreliable,"As many reviewers have noted this adapter works but not optimally. I've never gotten it to connect at better than 11 mbps and the connection frequently drops to 1 mbps. It works for basic web surfing (provided the users have administrative permissions to frequently repair the connection), but you won't be able to use it for many administrative LAN tasks (such as copying large files) because the connection drops so frequently."
3,Good - but no Vista support and so-so support,"As others already mentioned, the 423PI says Windows Vista will automatically detect and configure the card - but it doesn't. Mine did detect, but failed to install drivers ""automatically"" as TRENDnet's site says it will.Then comes another already mentioned caveat: support. After 9 minutes talking to a representative, it was suggested that I install the card into another PCI slot and, if that wasn't successful, on another PC running Vista! Now imagine this to a less literate user, and you can figure the mess.At the end, as I was running a trial version of Vista just for testing, I moved back to XP; the card was properly recognized and, with the drivers on the CD, configured in less than a minute."
1,Was I sent a 56k Wireless G?,DON'T BUY THIS!!!Yeah thats right. Because I could not get a faster downstream then 133kbps that on this piece of garbage. A laptop using the same wireless router got a 13mbps downstream when it was sitting right next to the PC where this piece of junk was plugged into.DON'T BUY THIS!!!
1,Terrible signal quality,"I bought this card for two reasons:1. It supposedly has excellent Linux support, at least as of Ubuntu 10.10.2. I was using a tiny little USB wifi adapter through 1 story of my house and a couple walls. I thought I could increase my network performance.I never tried #1 because I booted into Windows 7 first. #2 was a complete failure. The signal quality on this is simply AWFUL. It's not the antenna either -- I tried an enormous antenna on it (over a foot long) without much improvement.As a test, I tried my $10 USB wifi adapter alongside this TrendNet unit. The tiny cheap USB adapter was far better. I lost about 60% of my packets with the Trendnet. I lost *none* with the USB adapter, though latency would sometimes increase from <1ms to double digits.Bottom line is my little USB ""Azio AWU101N"" which I got for under $10 was better in every single way. Avoid this card."
1,Piece of Junk,"This product isn't even worth the time for a review. I just want to help those who are thinking of buying it...DONT!!! My computer is right beside the router...1 foot away...signal strength 80%. Move to 10 feet away and signal strength is down to 50 - 60%. Go round the corner and you've lost the signal. I wanted to move my desktop into the other room. This piece of junk isn't going to facilitate that.I had no idea a product of this type could be so poor. Wireless technology isn't rocket science anymore. Every cellphone or laptop i've seen or heard of does a better job. I didn't read the poor reviews because I assumed they would be people trying to use the product 50 meters away with lots of walls in between. I though that it should at least let me move to the other room no mater how bad it is...boy was I wrong. Needless to say, i'm throwing it out."
1,Barely works...,"Bought this for a computer running XP Home, and so far, it barely works. Constantly drops the connection and requires it to be repaired. Have tried tinkering with settings, updating drivers, and so on, all to no avail."
1,Not happy with product or customer service,"As of this writing, this product IS NOT Vista compatible regardless of what their web site says. TrendNet claims the XP driver also works for Vista. ""You just have to plug the board in, turn computer on, let it self install, and then upgrade the driver to the XP driver on install disk that came with it."" When I upgraded the driver to XP, it locked up my computer trying to install it. I thought the first time was a fluke, so cleaned out the registry, and tried it a second time with same results. The desktop is brand new and is not corrupted with other software or hardware.TrendNet's customer service is borderline rude. They basically try to hang up with you as fast as possible even though your problem is not even close to being solved.The price is nice, but you'll be wasting your time and money."
3,Poor Quality,"This product didn't work very well for us, could not get it working with the router within 10 foot range, wouldn't stay connected..."
5,No problems!,"It took a little longer than I anticipated for it to arrive, but that was no big deal anyhow. No problems!"
1,Don't waste your money like I did...,This has to be the worst scale I have ever owned. You could step on it five times and you never get the same weight twice. I'm doing the Atkins diet and I have no idea if I've lost weight or not as I can't get the same reading twice. It's going in the garbage today and now I have to buy another one.
5,Lenny and OutKast?! Too Funky!,"All I can say is that the song 'Again' was a beautiful ballad but when remixed by Earthtone III, it gets alot funkier. lenny and OutKast kill this track though many would deem them an unlikely combination. However, in this remix they created a beautiful rock and soul hybrid. We need more records like this."
3,Grows On You,"I saw this movie in the theatre when it first came out, and was hugely disappointed. I felt that it was the biggest waste of comedic talent since ""Mad Mad Mad Mad World.""But it grows on you. My categorical prior objection to the broad farce played by Sid Caesar and Ann-Margret, for example, is overborne by how great she looks. Subtle details of production begin to emerge. The filled whisky glass in the night stand drawer, for example. The continuous Peter Falk rehearsals for Columbo, which all happened later...it's a good movie for an easy evening."
2,Pan and Scan...and too much Falk,"Ho-hum. I give it two stars. There are some funny lines (as what Neil Simon script DOESN'T have funny lines), but it doesn't hold together like MURDER BY DEATH. One thing about that earlier film is that Peter Falk is only one of many, many detectives. When he's the star of the show, his Humphrey Bogart impression grows tired real fast. (Actually, it sounds like an impressionist doing an impression of Peter Falk doing an impression of Humphrey Bogart.) A lot of good supporting players, if perhaps too many of them. I did get annoyed at the ""pan and scan"" framing, but I certainly am not going to spend money buying a widescreen version should one ever become available."
2,Bogart Satire Misses the Mark,"Writer Neil Simon, actor Peter Falk and director Robert Moore reunite for this disappointing follow-up to ""Murder by Death"" (1976). The laughs are rather scant in Simon's lackluster satire of Humphrey Bogart classics (primarily ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Casablanca""). Falk's Bogart parody is less successful this time around, with the all-star supporting cast mostly wasted. Robert Luthardt's stylish production design remains among the few virtues. A weak effort, ""The Cheap Detective"" pales next to Steve Martin's ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid"" (1982) yet surpasses George Segal's disastrous spoof ""The Black Bird"" (1975)."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!,"this hand blender is cheap and lasted a very short time. the company i purchased it from sent me a replacement one and it wasn't any better. cuisinart said they were going to reimburse me and i am still waiting. hopefully i am the only who got the ones that didn't work, but chances are i'm not. spend a little bit more and get a good one. you will be glad you did!"
2,4x8 2inch thickness rainbow mat,"The mat looks great! I was thrilled with it until I felt it. The colored panels are not at all the same thickness or firmness. The blue panels in paticular are quite firm. The yellow panels are very soft and give easily. With blue and yellow being right next to each other it makes for a very awkward tumble or run. I didn't say anything to my kids about this unevenness, thinking they might not notice....THE DID! Now looking into exchanging the mat."
4,OK for Millet,"Upon opening the box containing the bag of millet, I noticed millet seeds sprinkled on the bottom of the box. After I lifted the bag out of the box, millet seeds sprayed all over the counter top - something for me to vacuum up later. To be fair, this isn't an unusual occurence for mail order millet; I just wish there hadn't been several holes in the bag upon arrival.The millet itself is inconsistent in length and fullness, some sprays robustly round and some anemically skinny. On average though, I'm not disappointed with the product. Jazz and Buddy like this brand of millet as much as they like the other brands they're experienced.Pricewise this millet isn't the best bargain out there, but one must consider that to the door delivery is included in the price. The cost is certainly in the range I've seen for millet locally."
1,What a poor product....CostCo's or Ikea's would have been superior,"We purchased 2 packs of 4 glasses each due to the more positive reviews, than the negative. Sadly we now have one of those eight glasses left. Each one never actually cracked apart so one could cut oneself, but we prevented that from happening ourselves by not continuing to use them but discard them as they developed noticable cracks in all areas of the glass (there was no pattern, some cracks were horizontal, some vertical).Yes, we washed them in the upper part of our dishwasher, but the advertisement stated that they are dishwasher proof. They never did get clowdy or anything, as stipulated, but developed the cracks after three months of use. By now, four months from the purchase, we have one (1) left out of the original eight (8).Buyer be aware.Therefore I would NOT recommend this product from this company, and would certainly not buy any other items from them."
1,It's TOO fragile!,I bought 2 of these set(8 glasses) two months ago and broke 6 of them with normal wear. The other set i bought from target was taking me 3 years to break 6 out of 8 glasses. Don't buy them!!
4,Mount Doomsday,"I found Dr. Donald A. Berman's novel, Mount Doomsday, to be an easy, entertaining read. The story of a radioactive volcano erupting in present-day time is interwoven with short chapters about the earth's volcanic history as viewed from the inhabitants affected by volcanic disasters. I found this effect to be successful in building up to the conclusion of the story. This is an entertaining, exciting story that is definitely worth reading!"
3,"For my sinks, not as good as Danco","At the same time I purchased two Danco 86720's strainers, I also purchased two of the ""SinkTastic Strainers & Stoppers."" Experimenting with both purchases, I learned that the Danco 86720's(Economy Basket Strainer with Rubber Stopper, Stainless) both held water in both sinks overnight after I adjusted the rubber stopper widths whereas both the SinkTastics leaked very slowly in two sinks full of water. I suspect the SinkTastics would have worked much better if the sink drain flanges were ""new smooth."" My drains are forty one years old."
5,Undertaker Rules!,"If you like the Undertaker, you must get this DVD! It's amazing! Some of the best, and rarest matches are presented here, as well as much of the Undertaker's behind the scenes private life. Again, this is a must see DVD!"
4,extras review,there are 5 matches in the extras:The Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels (In Your House:Badd Blood '97 - Hell In A Cell Match) - great battle. i don't know what happened but after hbk got catapolted into the cage he started bleeding without a blade. i dont't know how he did it. overrall it's a classic. 10/10The Undertaker vs Kane (WrestleMania 14) - one of taker's best mania matches.awesome 10/10The Undertaker vs Kane (Inferno Match - Unforgiven 1998) - the ending was very fake but still a good match.nice suicide dive by taker 8/10The Undertaker vs Kurt Angle (Fully Loaded 2000) - a good technical battle 7/10The Undertaker vs Triple H (WrestleMania 17) - a very good match.it's a brawl.
1,Junk!,Metal clip separated from leather holster in a few weeks. Plastic Clip broke and fell apart after a few months. Waste of money.
1,Not a very good TX case,"I don't know if the case I received is the same so many people have given such good ratings, but I didn't like the way it fit my TX.The front fit loose, the device corners were unprotected, and the SD/credit card compartments are not closed on either end, meaning their contents could slip out and fall with use. True, the material feels great and looks great when closed, but I want a case that will protect my device and not have me worrying over it. Good thing I didn't even get to be concerned over the belt clip/screw that everyone else has complained about.Basically, I put the case on my Palm, took a look at it and decided it was not what I expected, and not worth the $17 to give it a shot."
3,Great Product - CRAP CLIP,"Does exactly what it is designed to do. Fits like a glove. GREAT potection.HOWEVER:It is supplied with a belt clip made of plastic. It connects to a very substantial metal stud on the back of the case. It looks very nice and should be useful. BUT... If you desire to use it and clip it on your belt, stand perfectly still. DO NOT MOVE. DO NOT SIT. SO NOT BEND. It will IMMEDIATELY break at the hinge on the clip that too is made of plactic approximately 1/16"" thick. I was able to use it ONCE... Until I sat down in my car."
4,Great movie,I am a fan of Merhant Ivory movies and this movie is great. Great storytelling capturing the era wonderfully. Watch it.
3,"Luminox is good, but not indestructible","I have this watch plus two other Luminox's and the weak point on these timepieces is that they have mineral crystal displays instead of sapphire crystal. Expect your watch to get scratches and gouges on the crystal. Other than that, this is a good bargain for a Swiss movement and highly luminous dials and markers."
4,"Good book -- but more trucks, more diversity of people","My son loves the noises we make when reading this. Would be nice if it had one or two more vehicles and more diversity in the ""people."""
4,"Beautiful product, a little large for my needs.","Heading pretty much says it. This is a very nicely made piece of leather goods at a nice price. It is supposed to be a men's product, but I find it larger than is convenient. It is suitable for carrying in the back pocket, but if I wanted to do that I would probably get a thin conventional wallet. I have never carried a wallet or other large object in my back pocket, because it's uncomfortable sitting and ruins the fit of any good clothing. I will need to resume my search for the proper size change purse."
3,good conversation peice,something to talk about on the table.works ok as long as you don't get crums in the butter!
5,Great item,"I really like this item. I used to have to microwave butter or let it warm up to room temp, which took to long. This was a great find."
5,A FIND,"I do not recall how I happened upon this chapbook of poems, but I am glad I did and hope to order more of Kent State's poetry publications. The poems here are intense and insightful, a complexity of loss and conservation."
1,Not Good At All,The top was too hard and kept rubbing against my feet. Soaking in hot water did not help much. The sandal was too narrow and bigger than the size it claimed. I bought three pairs but fortunately at discount prices (that explains why.) I didn't like them and gave them ALL away. Stick with Adidas or Rider.
3,"Good book, not a great one.","Typical of the books publisher by Taunton, this is a well produced work -- nicely arranged, good photos, and with about the right amount of verbiage for each house. My less than five star rating is because I personally didn't find most of the houses to be that interesting design-wise (you may, 'look inside'), and I also thought too many of the house were either too big (several in the 2300-2400 sq. ft. size, which I don't consider 'small') or too expensive due to site conditions, materials or whatever. It not too hard to build a nice small home if you've actually got the budget for a much larger, more traditional house. I enjoyed the book, it's just not one of my favorites. A side note, all of the houses have been featured in Fine Homebuilding Magazine previously."
3,Useful Background for Laos,"As someone who is contemplating a work assignment in Laos, this book provides needed background on the cultural and political environment likely to be encountered. In addition to the coverage of people and events, I would have appreciated more elaboration on the typical lifestyles of lowland and upland people of Laos and how that has evolved recently. This was an interesting read, but it felt a bit disjointed at times and the writing does not measure up to the skill of better-known modern historians such as David McCollough and Walter Isaacson."
1,Do not buy this book!,"This book is just plain awful. The confusing nature of the writing, along with the lack of examples do not teach, but instead confuse. The author does a terrible job in attempting to teach through this writing. Do not buy this book! There are many other books which will benefit you much more by giving you more detailed examples and clearer ideas. This book is just a [money] doorstop. Do not make the same mistake I did in purchasing this book, please."
5,great childrens books,"The Berenstain Bears books are wonderful books for children. They have great fun, exciting stories, with really good life lessons in them. I recommend this and all Berenstain Bear books. They even have religious books too."
1,Wretched. . .,"Filled with absurd exercises, testemonials from the converted, and self-promoting prose. Take ""A Step Beyond"" to a better book: Harold Guskin's ""How To Stop Acting""."
2,Looks like a fake,"The picture looks great but I was disappointed when I received it.It looks cheap. Tried to returned it with multiple phone calls.In addition to the cost of shipping back, I got %30 penalty for returning.Will never buy from this merchant again."
3,Hmm Its just OK.,I was sent a blue pillow back in April 2010 and Ive been able to use it on a few trips. Its doesn't wieght very much so wieght isn't really a issue with this one. Even when packed its still a little bulky. Its a little bit too small and it doesn't have any real support or firmness to it. For now I keep it in my backpacking bag. But If I ever had space contrants It you be the first thing to go.
4,The Best Gundam Movie Ever,"I saw the film this past summer at the Otakon premiere in Baltimore. Having previously seen Yoshiyuki Tomino's original Gundam movies, I didn't quite know what to expect with this new film. Boy was I surprised. Unlike the other Gundam movies like Char's Counterattack, I was able to enjoy F91 without having any predisposition on the background or the world. It was a nice self-contained story with albeit 1990's animation, the action sequences of the mobile suits are top notch. Gundam F91 follows a young man caught up in a conflict between his home colony and a group known as the Crossbone Vanguard. With several twists and turns, relationships are key to a very fun movie. I hear that Bandai will be releasing this film as a Special Edition with remixed audio and a commentary track, its not out yet, but just based on the movie itself, I highly recommend it"
4,I like it for the price!,This case is thin. I would not use it for carryin when it needs to be protected. This is a great case for storage. It keeps the dust off and is of a good quality.
2,An unrealistic review for the NAPLEX,"I cannot, in all honesty, recommend this book as a review for the NAPLEX. Having recently (7/04) passed the NAPLEX myself, I found this book to completely off base with the subject material and level of difficulty of the exam itself. Case studies within Pharm Prep place undue emphasis on clinical decision-making, relying heavily on treatment guidelines and evidence-based medicine. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this, however, much of this material (guidelines etc) is NOT tested on the NAPLEX because 1) the material can become easily dated and 2) it is beyond the scope of practice of most practicing pharmacists. Remember NAPLEX tests minimum competency.This book may be a helpful in preparation for exams in pharmacy school but it is much more academic than practical.Overall, I regret purchasing the book."
5,My First BSC FRIENDS FOREVER,"The problem why they are fighting is that because they both fell in love to Jeremy. And then, Claudia and Stacey started fighting a lot. All because of Jeremy. Who will Jeremy choose?"
1,3 hour wast of time,"bad bad bad.bad storybad actingbad idea to watch thisthis was not worth the time or the money, every 5 min the story got more and more dumb"
5,love it,i am a big fan of disaster films. and this is a good disaster film. in the movie there are meteors aiming for earth and they have to save the day. sounds like Armageddon right in this they do not leave earth. in stead of destroying the meteor they deflect it with missiles. and with just enough force the meteor goes the other way. watch this movie if you love disaster movies like i do.
1,SAVE YOU'RE MONEY!!!!,"I give this movie a -10 stars because this movie isn't even worth one star! Well this film is one of the worst films that I have ever seen and wish to never see again. After about 20 minutes into the movie, I fell asleep. This is even worse than when my daughter watch the Teletubbies and they were colorful and did have some method to the madness!!! I gave this DVD away, because it was so horrible, and believe it or not...the darn thing was returned to me with a note that read: ""Thanks, but no THANKS!!!"" I guess that note says it all. I have filed this ""movie"" (and I use that term very loosely), in file 13 -- THE TRASH!"
1,I was wrong... Sandra Bullock CAN make a bad movie!,"I have always found Sandra Bullock to nothing less than mesmerizing - just not today... or should I say 13 years ago. To be fair, this isn't really HER movie, she just happens to play a minor character in it.To say this was a low budget flick is an insult to low budget flicks. I love movies and have quite a collection. I can usually find at least one redeeming quality in any movie and will frequently watch a not-so-good movie in it's entirety just to find that quality.Poor directing & acting, embarrassing editing, pathetic special effects (like the 'gun cam' shots) and an anticlimactic ending make this movie actually painful to watch. It's not often you'll hear me say this, but I was happy when this horrible waste of film and time was over! If it were an option, I would have rated this move a NEGATIVE 5 stars.I didn't like the movie..."
1,A VERY BAD MOVIE!,"Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress. That wasn't enough to keep me watching this movie. After about a half hour, I turned it off. Don't waste your time watching it."
3,Hangman alright..Bullock where?,Hangman is a movie releaseds to profit on Sandra Bullock. The movie itself is a passable movie with predictable plot and average acting...but giving Sandra Bullock top billing is questionable....she is in the movie for a total of about 15 minutes....It isn't a bad movie but it is far from good.
5,A Wonderful Tribute,"This film is art. it is made from the heart and shares the integrity of The Pranksters relationship to Tim Leary. the reviewers that dissed it don't understand the place it comes from. the ""unknown prankster"" mentioned by one of the negative reviewers is KEN BABBS, Ken Kesey's partner. The creator of the film is OB Babbs who grew up within the Pranksters. They resurrect the bus and take a magic trip to pick up Timothy Leary and together go to Camp Winnarainbow, Wavy Gravy's place. Tim is in it alot & is having a great time. it's a heartwarming tribute and a blessing for the viewers to see Tim just before he passed away. RIP Tim & Ken. Enjoy this terrific film!"

5,Awesome!!!,"Look this is not a bigtime Hollywood production...This is low budget warehouse fighting, no wires, no cables, and no amazing stunts...It's not a romantic comedy, it's not a drama, the acting isn't meant to bring you in to the story...the action is, and it suceeds, take it for what it is and you'll have as much fun as I did!!!"
5,Fenny and a lot of Action,"The episodes on this DVD were some of my favorites in the Dragonball Z sagas. The DVD has episodes of the strongest under the heaven's tournament. In this tournament Goku comes back to life for just one day to participate in the action. He meets his son Goten for the first time and there is a big family and freinds reunion. During the tournament a lot of action goes on and some other stuff that I won't tell you, but is really cool happens ( i dont wanna ruin it for u). All Dragonball fans sould definatly get this DVD."
1,H9 vs F707,My Sony F707 Cybershot(5meg pixal) failed after 5 years (the ccd went out) so I purchased the Sony DSC-H9 to replace it. This H9 is no comparison to the F707. 90% of the shots are blurry. The only way to use it I find is with a tripod. Clarity is terrible along with a poor flash. I was expecting equal or better when I purchased this camera since the F707 is no longer produced. I can only say if you are looking for a camera that takes quality pictures with clarity do not purchase the Sony H9. What bothers me most is the H9 is 8MP vs the F707 of 5MP yet the quality is not even close to the quality of the F707. Sony has produced a very poor replacement in my opinion.
4,Not what I expected,"I wanted a GOOD, but simple point and shot camera. All the reviews said how good this camera was, but not how complicated. Oh well much more to read and firure out!"
3,Functions Cool / Quality Not,"I've had this camera 22 days, I know because it is outside my return policy. All the features of this camera is nice, but the quality is not. My Nikon Coolpix 4800 (4 mega pixel) took a sharper looking image then the DSC-H9."
5,Wonderful Grump,"I had the opportunity to get my hands on a copy of this book and I must say that the story is wonderful. The illustrations are some of the richest I have ever seen in a children's book. My favorite part of this book is how delightful searching for the mouse is. I understand that this is a signature illustration of Mr.Ludy's books and I must say after having handed this book around my work, the mouse is fun for children AND adults of all ages."
5,Great book,Great book. Great condition. Love how everyone sees a different story. The book came exactly as it was told to me when I ordered it and came in a very quick turnover.Thank you.
2,This is not the original movie; it is an animated copy.,I bought this thinking that it was the original video. Beware that the Amazon advertisement does not readily point out this distinction.
4,easy and gental,"a good easy work out for my wife and me, we are in our 60's and not very flexable like the yoga MASTERS we tried tofollow in another vidio- are you kidding me, I could never bend like that even when I was 20"

5,"Finally, The Rock Returned to PPV!!!!","This was the best PPV since WM17 when The Rock was suspended by Vince. There is no doubt that he was ready to return. My favorite match is BookerT/Rock cause it had everyone in the back watching to see who would win the WCW title. I enjoyed the other matches especially Austin/Angle cause everyone was watching that one as well. I recommend this to any hardcore WWE fan out there. Every PPV out on video/DVD I recommend as well. No one puts on a PPV like the WWE. Believe me, you will not be disappointed."
5,Excellent Resource,This book is an excellent resource meant for anyone who is interested in repairing their credit. The form letters are extremely helpful and the step by step guidelines move you through the entire process. My credit has never been better.
5,PROVEN RESULTS!!,"I wanted to improve my credit score and learn everything possible about credit (ie. my rights, what actions impact my credit history, and how to maintain excellent credit.) I researched a lot of websites and read a few books about credit. Mr. Shapiro's book was the most complete, easy to read, and helpful source I found. I used his letters, following the directions he provided in his book, and removed a derogatory item from my credit report that should not have been there. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their credit score."
3,Just ok,"It was alright but not my favorite book. The author has a very strong bais for women & against men that comes across in her writing, which is what most turns me off from her work.Layne ignores all the African history of rhythm (the title does claim ""a spiritual history of rhythm""). Since most of what I've read from the African tradition is from males, I'm not surprised at the ommision.I disagree with the idea that the ""first"" drummers were women. I believe rhythm is as old as life & that humans, regardless of gender, have been participating & enjoying it naturally whether through drumming, clapping hands, clicking sticks, or stomping feet while sitting or dancing."
5,Great shoulder rest,"While the Bonmusica may be the most visually unappealing shoulder rest, it is remarkably effective at its job. With just a slight pressure from the chin, it is locked onto your shoulder and will not budge. The unique design allows for one to adjust the rest to fit one's body perfectly, and with comfort."
4,"Touching, But Thats All","To start of this is probably of the better 9-11 tribute DVD's. But, if that is all true, we need better ones. The first 45 minuites are very well done and deserves applause for it's stories and good information. But the rest is all just about are reaction to 9-11. This DVD is great, but if you wanted more information on the events of 9-11 you will fell hungry."
5,"Powerful Documentary, Beautifully Done","CNN has done an amazing job with this DVD. It is respectful, tasteful, and most of all, honors those who were killed in the Attack on America.I am a producer of live stage shows and watched this for possible use in an upcoming 9/11 memorial service. I sat in my office and relived the events of one year ago...and found myself in tears many times.Well done, CNN. God bless America!"
4,Welcome to non-linier time,"Time has five fingersOne is for the pastOne is for the presentAnd three is the futureAnd four is for what could have beenAnd five for yet could beWriter Tucker (Terumi Matthews) in Alice in Wonderland style unwittingly follows her mysterious beau from 1953 to 1997 and is involved in an attempt to change the past.We are introduces to several story threads and personalities. As we try to keep up with this non-linier story. Can the past and future really be changed or does what we do Stick.The film has that independent sight, sound, and feel; Shot on special color and black and whit film. The use of super 16 film and the second unit using 8 mm gives this film an other worldly look. They manage not to shake it as in Blair Witch.On thing I like it the book that they created ""The sticky fingers of time"" It plays a part of keeping the continuity of the story and right up to the last has significance."
4,Pretty good dryer,"Got this dryer for a trip to England & Ireland and used it in locations ranging from an international chain hotel to a local B&B.; With the appropriate plug adapter (I also purchased this reasonably priced set from Amazon:Lenmar AC5 World Travel Adapter/Converter Plug Set) it worked very well in every location. As some have noted, it is a full-sized dryer so travelers need to keep that size/weight in mind; the folding handle & retractable cord help when packing but it still is a big unit. While I do not have long hair, it is very thick and I need a full-sized dryer...this one, on the low speed recommended for UK use, worked as well as my dryer at home. For me, it was exactly what I wanted and needed."
3,cord does not retract,I bought this for my daughter. She has only used it for two weeks and is already complaining that she can't get the cord to retract. That was the reason I bought this particular hair dryer.
1,"heavy, clunky, industrial, blows only burning hot air",this hair dryer is definitely not suitable for travel or for drying hair. the air is extremely hot regardless of setting. it is very heavy and clunky.
4,Great,"If there was a 4.5 option Id've surely picked that instead of4. This because I was only disappointed with the finish, andI'm not even sure quite why. This is a wonderful movie,especialy if you like good acting (that should be emphasized)Though admittedly a character or two are (realisticly) corny,you're bound to know someone you can relate them to.There is a morsel of knowledge about the sales world in themovie which could be distilled into the following idea:You're own happiness and confidence always projects throughyour sales(wo)man persona and directly affects the experiencethat your customer is having which has as much to do with'selling' somone one a product as them actually needing it.Huzzah.-<(O)>-"
3,iffy,"Typical Jeff Daniels goofyness. This movie is lame, but entertaining. If you work in the cleaning industry, it's a must see. Just don't make it your saturday night, movie night . . . movie. Not really for young children."
4,If you like Victoria Holt you'll Love this book,This is set in today's world but reads like an old fashioned romance. I couldn't put it down. I only wish there was another 100 pages as I wanted to know even more about the 2 main characters. Excellent prose and characterization. The writing is superb.This is a Keeper !Look for the Bold Strokes Books edition published August 2004
5,U2 -ZOO TV LIVE FROM SYDNEY NOT ON DVD?????????,This is U-2 at thier very best great! video and sound! very livelooking! and a tragic! that this has not been re-mastered on DVD!ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE!
3,"Very OK, But Fast Forward Out Julia Roberts","This movie WAS actually watchable. I am in NO way a Julia Roberts fan. I think she's a mediocre actress who somehow got a huge following. And what a mistake she made being cast with Catherine Zeta-Jones who is the most gorgeous actress in the biz today. Talent and presence-wise, she can run rings around Roberts (will you ever see Roberts sing and dance like Zeta-Jones who deservedly just got an Oscar? Absolutely not in our lifetime.) And unfortunately for Roberts, she is aging badly, horse-face getting horsier( watch out, Julia, Reese Witherspoon is hot on your heels for the audience popularity crown.)Anyway, this movie has some very funny material that's original and fresh and is very worth a viewing. Not Billy Crystal's funniest, but an entertaining attempt. I would recommend it. I am buying the video so I can fast-forward through the obnoxious, big-mouth giggling Julia Robert scenes!"
2,BOOOOOOOOOORING,"I'm not a huge chick flick fan (This is a chick flick, right?) But this ranks among the worst. I just couldn't connect to the characters. There was nothing really funny and it didn't arouse any emotions in me at all. And it was pretty predictable that what's-his-face was going to fall in love with so-and-so's sister. I just didn't like it. If you want a chick flick that's really funny, I strongly recommend Miss Congeniality."
2,Nothing here..,"The cast really did their best, everyone included: Cusak, Roberts, Jones (exception: Crystal, who played himself Again!!).But all that effort was to no avail: the movie is junk. A good premise, but badly executed."
5,Nice Dog Food Container - Feeder,"Great product. It was exactly as described. Has a clean, sleek look. Nice container to store dog food in and for the dogs to eat out of."
2,Outside dogs,"Have had one for years, My outside dogs uses it on a daily basis. Couple of concerns, It does not seal good enough to keep moisture out. I have even built a overhang roof for it and the food still spoils or gets moldy. So to solve that i only put enough for 5 days not the whole 25lbs. Also the dogs bottom teeth are worn down from rubbing on the bottom of the feeder. I am ordering a plastic one now to see if that helps. It is nice they can snack when they are hungry."
3,Winstar = 1 star,"Film: 5 stars/ dvd transfer: 1 starI would strongly urge anyone interested in purchasing this DVD to research if they can find another version rather than this version. Belive me, this film is worth it.Winstar you've burned me yet again. I've bought 5 other titles from them, and all except one were total pieces of ..., transfer-wise. It's like they don't even care at all. Hou-Hsiao-hsien and Francios Truffault deserver better, and so do you."
2,Two stars,"Both my wife and I did not find this video to be very informative or useful in learning to do a man's(i.e. my) hair cut. We suggest if that is your goal, look for another video or book."
5,"Beautiful, Inspiring DVD","This precious dvd has lifted my spirits when they've been down. With great cinematography and sound, we can learn how the greatest hymns of the faith were sometimes born out of faith-testing trials and tragedies. This one is a real keeper. Makes an excellent gift for almost any occasion."
1,Constant problems with this faucet,"I have had this faucet several years and have had it repaired twice. Moen always sends the parts, but since I'm paying a plumber to work on it, this has become a very expensive faucet. Now Moen has replaced it with a new (identical) faucet, but I'm not willing to pay for another installation and am currently researching for a more reliable faucet. The 2 ongoing problems I have had are the chrome on the body stains due to constant ""oozing"" around the seams and the sprayer will not stay securely in the faucet after just a few months of normal household use (no kids playing with it, just myself cooking for 2 people). The Moen service is courteous and fast, but unless you are willing/abel to replace the parts and faucets yourself this is not a bargain."
3,"Good, taught horror tale marrred by weak ending","Most of this book was pretty good -- a taught, fast-paced, well-written horror tale, if admittedly a bit heavy on the perversion. (Though that's par for the course for a lot of modern horror.)As I was reading it, I was estimating a four- or five-star rating for it. However, the ending was so weak and abrupt it knocked it down to three in my estimation. With a stronger ending this could have been a top-notch horror novel."
3,A prototypical B-Movie in book form,"Richard Laymon's, ""The Cellar,"" is straight up your quintessential B-Movie reconfigured into book form. All the elements are intact - gory and savage violence, a high body count, graphic and disturbing sexual content and some nasty, twisted 'bad-guys' to keep things interesting.Originally published in 1980, this book still manages to feel 'contemporary' as there is nothing by way of story/setting to date this book back a quarter century ago. With a brisk pace and constant flow of violence and action, those looking for a bit of mindless literary entertainment will find the experience satisfying like a good B-Movie should."
4,"Not the first of its Kind, But still Finger Licking Good!","This book is not the first of its kind. It is in a large way very much like and some parts are even in part a translation of the J.A. S. Collin De Plancy's Dictionnaire des Sciences Occultes, (which was created in two volumes in 1848). A lot of the entries are eerily similar and have the same subject matter with few differences. Although I must admit its easier to read Spences' version if you are not familiar with French and if you could find a viable copy of De Plancy's work. Between the two you can get a massive amount of information concerning the subject. Some entries are more extended in one version than the other."
4,THE HELDENTENOR,"By the time these programs were broadcast, Melchior's operatic career was long past but his voice was still in good enough condition to give all the Heldentenors who followed him a good lesson in the art of singing Wagner. Most of the music is light but his charm carries the day."
4,The best ep ive ever heard,"I have been a huge Thursday fan for a year. I bought Full Collapse at that time. I went to Maui a few months back and bought Waiting. I have been waiting for Five Stories Falling for a while so I was so stoked when i got it. I am blown away. I have never seen them, but people that say they put on a amazing show and they are right. All four songs are absolutely amazing. They are played a little worse than the record (not a bad thing), which for me I like better; to have something different than the album. And Jet Black New Year; i'm speachless. I didnt really listen to it until the next day because i was busy with the live tracks, but thats honestly the only time in my life where i used the repeat function on my cd player. I listened to it over and over again. It's so amazing! It's got the classic Thursday sound except a little different, but it takes you on a journey. It's like 4 songs in one. COMPLETELY AMAZING!"
1,What band is this again?,"I listened to this album, from beginning to end, with an open mind. I couldnt find much that was interesting or unique in these songs. It's all too identical to the emo/indie tunes of today. Everything from the guitar riffs, drum beat style, to the vocal melodies sound all too familiar (including the haircuts)Somebody help me find what im missing here, somebody point out and specify what is really interesting, original and good in this album, because to me this sound is exhausted."
2,Can They Do Better?,"Ok Thursday there sssooo good ok im not trying to sound like im coll and old skool but ive liked them since the beginning virtually and i know how good they are ive seen them twice which is quite an achievement when you live in england. There so good live but this really isnt the greatest recording of them live...Geoff (the lead vocalist) really can sing but when your leaping around its really hard and there just alot better to watch and hear live then to just jhear....you need the visual they can play there instruments but this isnt a good recording ill say again.The only two reasons id buy this is1.you love thursday and must have everything made by them2.You want the new track ""jet black new year"" which i must say is excellentif you dont have a thursday release i suggest you get full collapse or waiting and if u decide you love them like i then go for this onthere amazing live...just not on this sorry guys but im not gonna lie"
3,"Good, but didn't like the format.","When RAW recently came out with the fifteen year anniversary dvd, I was happy that it showcased RAW chronologically. The Smackdown ten year anniversary dvd's format is the form of a top 100 countdown making it come off as a cheap VH1 produced show. It has some good moments but feels very random."
4,Great study book,"I was studying an undergraduate module in Judaism and found it very helpful and accurate. I also bought the Book of Jewish Belief whih was also very good. It is perhaps a little old, but still relevant."
5,Great walkaround lens!,Lens is extremely light and of highest build quality and has an equivalent 32.5mm focal length when used on a APS-C sensor.
5,The only one you'll need!,"If you are looking for a Cockatiel or have one already,this is the only book you will need. Very well written!Very easy and fun to read! All the LATEST up-to-date imformation. GET IT!"
5,a need to read,This book was an informative book . It covard the subject very well and was a joy to read. I have raised birds for fourty years and am glad this book was writen.
2,"off taste, hard no mix","I'm reviewing the strawberries and cream flavor. I had the whey protein S&C and it was awesome so I bought this flavor of weight gainer. It tastes artificially sweet, as if you dumped packets of Splenda into the bottle. Plus it never mixes completely in my shaker bottle with water or milk. It is a real pain, even in smaller amounts. I can't believe this company made an awesome whey protein powder AND this Gainer disaster!"
1,Not something I would suggest .,"Though I take to risk of coming off pompous, Aly & A.J.'s premier concert CD suffers a dire lack of substance. To start, the DVD menus are poorly animated and uninspiring. The concert film quality is flat and dull - suffering from what I suspect to be the grain compression of sub 53X grade film. The concert itself also did not impress me, the girls show a very poor displace of stage presence, contrasting specifically with the spirit of stage contrast. The song choice holds very little flow as the concert progresses, and the girl's wardrobe was typical and ordinary, especially AJ's.Overall I would say this DVD is not worth the list price. For a more spectacular, well rounded concert performance I would suggest Bob Marley - Live at the Rainbow Room."
5,aLy & aJ's OnE tHe RiDe DvD!,"Aly & Aj are so talented... although they are'nt as well-known as Lindsay Lohan and Hilary Duff they are the next pop princesses! The dvd features live performance's for Do You Believe in Magic?, Rush, No One, On the Ride and more! I'm not promoting Target or anything but if you buy it there you get the music video for Rush aswell as the making of the video!! Great buy"
2,I ROFL'd,"I seen this movie on TV some years ago and as far as I can remember I liked it. I purchsed the movie a couple days ago and watched it last night.. and all I can say is ROFL!This show was REALLY bad and I love all kinds of weird creepy alien movies. The first time I seen the aliens I about fell out of my bed laughing. I can't believe how stupid they were. The movie doesn't flow really well its one scene after another with black scence in between (feels like its going to commercial).I'm glad to have the movie so that its part of my collection of werid alien movies, but probably not something I well really ever watch again. Its way too boring, and just doesn't feel like other alien movies.Lots of people keep comparing this movie to Signs, and that's not really fair because Signs was nothing like this movie, and it was a million times better!"
3,Design Idea for Great American Homes: Additions,"Beautiful book, beautiful photos, wonderful ideas IF you either have a two-story home or would like to add a second story addition to your one-story home. For me, however, the book served no particular purpose and was a great disappointment as my intent is to increase the size of our home by going outward, not upward."
2,this isn't even the movies,"this video is a exellent overview of disney's musical talents featuring x-mas, this isn't even the movies and it is dreadful This video is short and not really fufilling in any way I suggest that the full movies should be bought and forget this made up stuff"
3,good quality ok book,"I ordered this book for a class and was disappointed in the literature but he physical quality was outstanding. Maybe because of the authors whorish attitude or her presumptuous way of writing that I didn't like the book, either way I had to buy it and was glad it wasn't all torn."
3,Cute,"It's a nice Hello Kitty stuffed doll and looks great. However, the glue holding Kitty down hasn't held her down since the day I bought it. I tried to glue her down again but nothing works. It matches the crib set and once we move on to something else, it will be donated."
5,Fantastic solid wood furniture,"I ordered 4 pieces from the strathwood balboa set (armless chair, corner chair, chaise and ottoman to form a sectional) and I LOVE them. I checked out a very similar sectional at Pottery Barn for over $3000 and I'm so glad that I bought this one instead. It arrived on time, in great condition. Amazon service was incredible when one of the pieces was held up, they made sure it arrived on time. It was relatively easy to put together, but did require a little muscle. Once assembled, it is rock solid and really great looking. The cushions are very firm and look terrific in cream, but wont stay clean for long. I don't think they are weather resistant but the whole set is so affordable. I think I'll dye them a taupe or chocolate color to hide the wear. Great furniture, great service, great buy!!!!"
4,Tug of Heart- Opening the door to my own transformation,"What a wonderful book, and the synchronicity of the timing is impeccable! So much of it resonated with my current shifting on both a personal and professional level. The book is an easy read, encouraging us to stop and listen for direction from within. And though we often don't know what the future holds, the book has reinforced a long-ago knowing... reminding me of my own inner wisdom. And not suprisingly, when I remember to open to my hearts message, it never steers me wrong. Kudos to the author for a timely message. I'm now learning to keep my heart open and to enjoy the ride. Thanks to the author for gracing our lives with this wonderful tale of intuition and abundance."
3,An Interesting Read...,"The best thing about this story is that I came to care about the main character and it is easy to empathize with her. Using her voice to ""speak"" to the ""writer"" or her story was a little cheesy - it did not seem to work well (for me at least). Overall, an interesting read...worthwhile."
3,Hilarious,"Which I don't think it was intended to be .. at least not in the scenes I found funny.I'm not knocking the cheap effects (use some imagination .. it's a fantasy film), nor the fraction of a budget of LOTR, but could they have saved a bit of money on the effects and paid for some screenwriters to edit the script, or at least go over the storyline and redline it.- how to protect yourself from a grenade that has been lobbed into a cave that you are standing in? .. A: throw yourself on top of the nearest woman.I could go on, but it is not worth my time .. btw, how did the elf-woman hero survive being stabbed by the baddies sword .. I'd fallen asleep by that bit?As another reviewer commented .. 'is it over yet?' Goes on for at least an hour too long."
2,No Sub-Titles!!!,"My wife enjoyed the movie; however, I could not. There is not the option for sub-titles!!! I'm hard of hearing so I could not follow the movie. I watched 10 minutes and gave up. I thought all DVD movies were required to have sub-titles for the hearing impaired?"
2,Almost a good movie,"As I started watching it, it was pretty clear I was missing something. It was filmed as though I should know all about what had happened previously. Was there a part 1 to this series? So I checked around... nope. This is all there is (two parts on one DVD). What an editing nightmare. It ""looked"" pretty good for a TV/movie... I just couldn't finish it and gave up disinterested."
2,Average at best,"This book has a fair amount of helpful nutrition information for parents who aren't aware of the nutrients that are important for growing children. It focuses more on how to ""be lazy"" and less on what to actually feed your children. The author recommends that to ""save time"" you do things like prepare your ingredients in advance and cut up veggies for snacks when you first get home from the grocery store. Obviously, these methods don't actually save any time - they just alter when you expend your time. There are also strange little charts at the end of each chapter that supposedly demonstrate how you can now save time - but they are difficult to understand and seem like wasted space. Many of the time-saving hints are also money-wasting ones. There are not a lot of recipes in this book. Some of them do not sound appealing. Many of the recipes contain dairy products in some form - cheese, cream, cottage cheese, etc. I was not impressed by this book."
1,Horrible show,this show is beyond corny&has no redeeming social value whatsoever. the writing is poor&the Characters aren't fully developed at all. this show ain't showed me much at all.
3,The Boondocks: The Complete First Season,"I thought the complete first season dvd of the Boondocks was very entertaining, if you are a fan. One negative review I have to give is to the episode about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It was very very boring. I understand what the producers where trying to relate, but made a part of this very funny season I would gladly skip."
5,Birthday Gift,This was a birthday for my husband. He loves it and really enjoyed being able to watch The Boondocks when he wants to.
5,Funny and Educational!,"The one thing I always love about the The Boondocks, is that it's hilarious and educational, if you pay attention to the message within the comedy. The Comics have a sensible way explaining it, while the TV show goes over the top of explaining it. And these messages usually deals with real life issues within the world of pop culture, the entertainment industry, the music industry, and how society just basically falls into the nonsense of it all in the end. Now depending on how you look at the show way of explaining these issue, you will either love it, or hate it. There will always be a hilarious joke that can be either, offensive, rude, or down right insulting, but like the old saying goes ""The truth hurts"" and The Boondocks isn't afraid too tell you it. Overall I enjoy the series (Season 1&2), and recommended this to anyone who open minded about comedy."
4,Classic satire,Cutting and deep reaching satire and highly entertaining. Can't say much that hasn't already been said about how good this series is.My only complaint is the single verse lyric that plays over & over all through the menu and the opening credits. It gets to be pretty annoying.
2,Fuddy Duddy of a film in my eyes...,"Didn't see any extreme violence in this movie or anything sexually graphic as I've seen worse in other movies...Kind of a dud to me, I was expecting to see more gore and something more graphic in nature. Don't really see what all the hype its about."
5,Tough to watch but a must see!,A look into the darkest parts of the human mind with sincerity and a touch of the bizarre. Not for the squeamish or easily offended. Seeing this movie is an experience that is eye opening and also makes you want to close your eyes and look away. But never the less its a stark look at the reality in which we actually do live in. Not all of us...just some of us. A true work of genius. And I never use that label lightly. Check out everything the director Garpar Noe has to offer. He is a mastermind of masterful film.
4,Brutal existential drama: to live is nothing easy!,"From the times of Taxi Driver I had not watched such explosive charge of violence and latent bitterness. It's France 1980. A retired butcher fights for surviving. His past is dark, since he was in prison. After leaving his autistic daughter, he residences with his pregnant lover, Lille, with the firm resolution of initiate a new life. Nevertheless he does not love her. Slowly, his hopes turn in bitterness and his bitterness become obsessions. Taking in account the Goddess fortune will bring him a good job and good friends, he watches how these fervent illusions will vanish. Because in Paris, as any other city, to live has become a selfish act. He against the world, a loaded weapon; three bullets and a violent dramatis personae will ignite the screen. A mesmerizing film that only may be seen under the most recommended advertences: it' s a hard film to watch; not for squeamish."
5,very good,I Stand Alone is a great movie that seems to vent a lot of anger people may keep inside. I thought it was very well done and Gaspar Noe is a talented director.
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"Purchased these glases as a graduation present for my nephew. During checkout process there was no option for me to indicate that product was a gift; therefore I was concerned about an invoice being included with glasses, which would create an embarrassment to my nephew, as well as to me. Contacted Amazon, directly after purchase for help (three times), and was told to contact vendor directly , of which I did---Three times with no response. Finally received a return phone call from vendor to discuss matter, but it was too late! The glasses had already been delivered. Vendor's response left in voicemail claims they were new to Amazon and didn't understand the rules of customer contact! This will be my FIRST and LAST purchase from Amazon."
5,Just a sec...,"I can only put this book down long enough to write this review. I left corporate 2 years ago to follow my purpose. It's the best thing I've ever done. I know that the overall outcome of the work I do is benefiting the planet. However, even I still forget to look around and take in what's important. I picked this book up in the airport... I had 3 other books in my bag, I didn't need another one. But this one leapt out at me and I'm sure a little angel had something to do with it."
5,One of the best hair care products I've ever used.,"I've been using this for several years because it leaves my hair with a lustrous shine and soft as silk texture. It has a very light and clean fragrance. . . My nine year-old Granddaughter is hooked on it. It's been increasingly difficult to find this in Alaska, and even then it's about twice as expensive. I was really happy to find in in Amazon!"
5,High quality product,"I used to use hot tools in high school years ago and hadn't thought about it again until my other curling iron broke. I am glad it did, because this is a great product. I am very happy with the way it curls my hair. Just be careful - it gets VERY hot."
2,Not that great,"I purchased this because I was looking for a curling iron that would give me waves, but not too much of a curl. It doesn't really heat up as hot as I'd like it to.. therefore, the curls don't stay longer than about 30 minutes. I read great reviews on Hot Tools before buying.. maybe mine is defective. In my opinion, it's not that great. Infra shine is a much better brand."
2,you'd better to purchase a ceramic one rather than this one,"It does curl my hair, but it's not ceramic, I used low heat but it still fries my hair..."
3,A Good Curling Iron but the clamp doesn't always hold,"I like this curling iron in that it gets hot fast. However I'm not convinced it gets as hot as it should. My stylist has the same curler and it seems hotter but then that could just be my imagination. My biggest gripe with this product is that the clamp doesn't always hold the hair, no matter how small a section I pull. The clamp seems loose somehow.That makes it frustrating when I keep having to put the same section of hair back into the iron to curl it. I will continue to try using it, especially given the fact that my stylist swears by it. So some of this issue may be due to ""user error"". However, I have since purchased another less expensive one and the clamp works much better so that kind of clinches it for me."
1,Caution,"Helen of Troy 1 inch jumbo curling iron, beware. Upon using this product, purchased within the last 30 days the thermostat must have suddenly burnt out and I lost a badly charred chunk of hair. The smell was disgusting and I will not trust that supposedly professional brand ever again."
5,Great for short hair,"I was given a used 1"" barrel hot tool by my hair cutting place. I cleaned it and used it for a while. I was so impressed with the speed with which it warmed up, the choices of temperature, the smooth barrel and the ease of cleaning that I bought the 5/8 barrel size for my sometimes very short hair. I works great for me!"
2,My first words were WOW,It is WAY too big. I dont need a iron that big so I returened it. I also ordered the izunami flat iron 1 inch at the same time which curls hair(loose or spiral) so I retured the curling iron. They dont exaggerate the word jumbo that IT IS!!!!!!!
4,Great!!,"For my type of hair this works great!! i have tried it on my sister who has finer hair and it is good it just doesnt last as long, good news is that that is what hairspray is for!"
4,Good product,Have used hot tools curling irons in the past and they make make high quality products. Love the gold curling irons as they give a better beautiful smooth curl to my hair compared to other curling irons.
1,Lasted Only 3 Months,"Bought this curling iron about 3 months ago and the spring has alreadybroken. To use it, I have to manually push it closed. The spring, which looksvery cheap, actually shifted out of place. I tried to force it back to realigncorrectly, this worked for 1 day, and then it shifted back. This is the firsttime I have bought this brand and will never purchase from them again. All the othercurling irons I have had have lasted for years and years. Can't believe this onelasted only 3 months. What a waste of money! Other posters here have also hadthe spring fail, so this is not an isolated problem. Do NOT buy this."
4,"Ordered to replace my older, smaller barrel version","Just used it for the first time. The barrel is quite large, but for my longer than shoulder length hair it's not a problem. This is my second Hot Tools Pro... never had any issues. I'm far from a professional and only curl my hair on occasion, but I would recommend this item."
1,End Cap Melted Off,"The end cap melted off the end of the iron. Of course, this happened after the 90 day return period. Will attach picture so others can be warned before purchasing this product."
5,Thick wavy long hair,"I purchased this because this is what i used as a hair stylist in a salon and always got great results. This iron gets hot fast and has a tempreture control on it low heat for fine hair. High heat for cours hair which is how mine is. My Hair is very thick and goes to my bras strap on my back. This is just a little to big of a curling iron on my hair to get the achieved curl. A 1"" or even a 1 1/4"" curling iron would be perfect. This will give you that tosseled textured look instead of curled which is still a great look. It is however squeaky and these curling irons this big the springs tend to pop out or break but comes with extra. I will get years of use out of this iron for sure. But if your looking to achieve loose ringlets i would go with smaller for sure... A heat protectant on your hair is a wise choice with a professional iron also."
2,not that good,"its hard to curl my hair, have to wait about a min to let my hair curl and its expensive donesn't worth the money do not buy it.."
1,I would love it if it worked,"I heard so many wonderful things about this curling iron and so I decided to disregard the few bad reviews and go for the purchase. Unfortunately, the thing works maybe 15% of the time. When I plug it in, I pray that the light will come on and I can do my hair. Most of the time it doesn't. Since this happened to a few other reviewers, it seems that my bad iron is not a fluke. I would return it and make a big stink but I have neither the time nor the patience."
3,Works well but will only last 1-2 years,"After using other irons, I loved that this one had a longer barrel to hold more hair (and long hair) as well as a larger area at the tip to keep you safe from burns. But that's where the good review ends.After using this for about 2 years, the clip is extremely squeaky (but I think this can be replaced). However, like a few of the reviewers say, the swivel technology of the tangle-free cord eventually causes the power connection to break and render the curling iron useless since the connection becomes very intermittent. At this point, I am just looking for a new iron that will last me longer than 1-2 years."
3,Ok..,thought this was gonna be the greatest curling iron ever.. its meh.... works ok.. my curls dont really stay. gotta overload on hair spray... sad face. it does heat up fast tho... so that is a plus...
5,Very Happy with this curling iron...,Excellent curling iron. It works like those they use in the hair salons. This is the second time I purchase one of these.
5,Hot tools,I love this curling iron. This is the only curling iron I have ever got to curl my hair and hold it. I have long thick hair and this works amazing!
5,Makes a Difference,"When my hair was shorter, I used the Hot tools brush curling iron, which was about 12 years old. I grew my hair out to a chin length bob, and coudn't use it anymore. Too much tangling. I really didn't want to spend a lot of money for a new iron, so I just picked up a Conair. I used it for a year, with OK results. It was wearing out, and needed to be replacedd, so I decided to try the Hot Tools again.My hair is thin, fine, and straight. The difference was surprising. With the Conair, the volume and slight curl was gone in a few hours. Using the same volumizer and hairspray, the volume and curl lasted all day with the Hot Tool iron. I actually use less hairspray. I would recommend this product. It is worth the extra money, and it is a much better quality iron. I will never waste my money on the cheaper irons."
4,cool,I really like the map. it looks great on my wall and it being laminated is a plus. But i agree with all the other reviews that it is thin and tears rather easily with push pins if your not careful. shipping was fast... the things it comes with t hold up are pretty useless too... other than that im happy with the product.
2,Too Flimsy,"Upon receiving this item, I was sadly impressed at how flimsy the paper and lamination were. It seemed that even a gentle touch put a visible crease in the map. I liked the graphics (colors, etc.) but, unless hanging it on a wall permanently, regular use of this map would wear it out way to soon for me."
2,Bent down the middle..,"I was very excited for this product to come and today when I received it the whole middle was bent. This created a huge crease down the middle of the map which made it look used and tacky. It should have been shipped in a more stable box to prevent this from happening. Also for the price that you pay, it doesn't give you the quality that I was expecting."
4,nice but dented map,"My only problem with this item was the delivery method-super saver shipping with the USPS. It arrived in a long tube that had obviously been bent in half. The map itself was dented but not ripped. I chose not to get involved with the headache of dealing with USPS & Amazon to return the map. I can live with it. However, I would caution others to not think economics with this item. The other options may be more advantageous. And, if you have a mall nearby, take a drive and get it yourself."
3,Simple and not very detailed,"Excellent packaging. Detail is pretty simple, and no boundaries are illustrated for the States, Russia, etc. It's very basic, but good for a quick glance."
2,Crumpled and Wrinkled,"Well the map is great, but it came in a big box, that the delivery company didn't bother to care about, so it was folded and bent and wrinkled. I almost felt like returning it but i am going out of the country too soon."
2,Thin laminate,The laminate matrial was thin and very easily wrinkled. It is also not very durable. This is not the quality i expected.
2,Too big.,"Ordered same size as my other panties, but these were too large. After washing and drying, they do NOT shrink."
3,Bali full cut cotton briefs from Amazon,"These briefs are comfortable and don't ride up. But they are very light weight, have a synthetic feel rather than a cotton feel, and they have more than a ""touch of stretch"". With 10% spandex, they are practically one-size-fits-all. Briefs with 5% spandex and heavier fabric would have suited me better."
2,Some Problem Points,"This video does cover great moves for hip flexibility and it's most helpful that Tursi has two other practitioners demonstrate various degrees of accomplishment, vs. just stating what a less flexible person than she could do to modify the move. As a Beginner, though, I found the following quite troublesome:1. Tursi and her two helpers have on black yoga pants which don't contrast with the dark background, thus making it difficult to see their various leg positions.2. The music is too close in volume to her voice level (vs. being a lower, background complement), so that when she does explain a position in detail, you have to really listen (or re-listen) to be clear on what part should be where.So, just a warning to Beginners or maybe even Advanced Beginners (which this video says it's for), I think these are MAJOR issues to consider before purchasing."
4,very watchable.,"Keeping in mind that this is a ""Brit"" Sci-fi and the era it was filmed in, I found it very watchable. Not for everyone but I think a wide audience would enjoy the series, especially the zombie apocolypse and the end of the world Mayan calander folks."
1,Broke almost immediately. Worthless product.,"Broke the first time we used it. One pizza, no problem. Put on the second and it cracked. Please do not buy this worthless product."
1,Save yourself some headaches,"This product is horrible. I've been having alarm issues with this device since day one. At first the alarm does not work properly by either not firing or can't turn the darn thing off, tried to download the patches but it doesn't fix anything. And to aggravate things, the patch that I downloaded RESET EVERYTHING to the factory settings...you WILL LOSE everything(it does NOT come with backup software...so becareful). Expect to encounter these hard resets everytime you download a patch from HP. So you'll be re-installing any apps that you have in addition to setting up your outlook synch. The customer service people are clueless so it'll contribute to your aggravation. Also, setting up your mobile provider network isn't as simple either. Save your money and get something else that's NOT an HW6945...you'll save time and headache.I was greatly disappointed with this product, will never touch another HP PDA again....waste of money."
4,Great Fun,A great fun little book about Germany before Hitler came along. I like different whodunits and Emil and the Detectives just like Bigfoot Littlefoot and West is original. Recomended.
4,gilligan was found and time warped to the west,"ok so this is just gilligan in the west, and it isn't as funny or as hip as that early series was , it is still fun and my young sons will sit and watch these with me and laugh and really thats the best and only reason to own this collection. fun for the family and i don't have to worry about any bad words or anything like that. check these old slap stick shows out."
1,very confusing movie,It is very hard to make sense of this movie and the plots drag on and on and on- very frustrating and pointless. This movie has nothing to do with Bible or any Biblical facts- don't waste your time and money.
3,"Not bad, but don't expect much... ;-P","I purchased Cartoon Marathon, Vol. 1 & 2 from a discount bin, and was pleased to see a number of cartoons I have not seen since I was young. However, the quality isn't all that great (probably because they have not gone through a ""remastering"" process). Also, I found that the block of Popeye cartoons on Volume 1 is identical to the Popeye block of cartoons on Volume 2, though differnet cartoons are listed on the sleeve.Again, if you don't have to spend more than a couple of bucks for them, they're worth having, if for nothing else the simple nostalgia."
1,A bunch of Misinformation.....,The work presented in this video is completely false. Mark Hazelwood is just stealing the information that Nancy Leider talks about. Planet X is not coming to kill us.
4,Awesome taste,These taste great; however I don't feel it satisfies hunger as much as other protein bars but I really like the taste and texture. It is very low in sugar and carbs so I would rather have this than another bar full of calories.
2,Save Your Money,"On the advice of a very trusted friend, I purchased this dog, after asking Jim if I should buy it. He answered yes; enough said- I did that very thing. Poor advice. The story, and the life lessons contained therein, are very worthwhile. But the reward does not, in my opinion, justify the risk. Obviously, the reward is the life lessons; the risk is the visual images of two guys traveling horseback with a three day old corpse. Jim had said he didn't want to spoil it for me, by telling me too much before I'd seen it. I'd rather he'd spoiled it- the movie certainly smelled."
2,"Should have been titled ""Brokeback Mountain 2""","I wish I could get the two hours back that I wasted watching this movie. It portrays Americans as being lazy, stupid and ignorant (except of course Tommy Lee Jones' character) who is gritty, witty and a master criminal investigator. I also find it amusing that [Jones] judges Barry Pepper's character for making a bad shoot and accidentially killing Malquiades while he[Jones]hires illegal aliens, commits adultery with the town hooker, and decides kidnapping is acceptable.I guess I should have known that this movie would depict Americans in a bad light and make the Mexican's (including the Human smuggler) appear innocent, good hearted and loving.Instead of a good Tommy Lee Jones movie you get a politically biased American hate film."
3,Intrusive Mortals,"Some of us who have managed to live among you unnoticed might not appreciate your looking too closely at what we are doing. So, perhaps you shouldn't watch this film. Not if that means you are going to come looking for us.There are enough people tramping all over and dropping their garbage without adding even more!We who are even here in pixels might well go so far as to suggest that you simply leave us alone. (Although we are not adverse to some milk and honey or a biscuit left out for us now and then.)Assuming we were real. Which we are not. Stay focused upon your own lives and do not block our paths. If you happen to see us take care by which eye.We are simply fiction."
4,Intriguing.,"This is very much an Orson Scott Card novel: the characters spend a good third of the book debating whether what they want to do (the main action of the story) is ethical or not. I found both the premise and the resolution intriguing; I thought things worked out a little bit too neatly at the end, though (this book was a long time in the writing, if his comments in the bibliography are any indication; it really seemed like the last part of the book should be 100-200 pages longer, since the whole story was building up to it and then it was over pretty quickly). I'm a little surprised that this is ""volume 1""; I didn't notice any particularly loose ends.I liked it, but I like books where the characters experience moral quandries. You might or might not"
5,Interesting read,"Though I at times find Orson Scott Card to be arrogant, the man can write. I am always impressed how he can take a historical event, completely rewrite it & yet still find a good deal which is historically accurate & relavent. I also appriciate that though there are Christian overtones in many of his books, as this one, it's not preachy. He does not ignore the facts such as the Catholic church entwining pagan rituals into Catholicism in order to entice other culture, and of course the almighty dollar.I enjoyed this book & the 'what if' factor, though it was vaguely remnisant of an early work done by Issac Asimov about time travelers who worked to improve the past. I wonder if Cards imagination was sparked by that book."
1,Fell apart after a couple o fuse,"I have little good to say about this stuff. I bought it based on stellar feedback. However, after a couple of use, one of the two buttons started falling apart. It has made the product virtually useless!"
3,Not silent enough,"I'm an SAT Tutor and I was looking for a silent stopwatch that my students could ideally bring to the SAT Test center. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find out about the audible clicking on this one that would likely irritate the test proctors. However, it certainly has its good points. It only has 2 buttons: Start/Stop and Lap/Reset. This makes the operation very simple. I use it for many other things other than SAT. I use it whenever I am timing myself. However, I would recommend a silent digital stopwatch over this when it comes to standardized test-taking."
5,Ultrak 410 Simple Timer Stopwatch,"Purchased this for my husband. He was using the complicated one that has all the functions, but half the time it didn't work. All he needed was just a stopwatch. This one has turned out to be great! Simple, simple, simple. It's easy to read as well."
5,Yoga Inside Out go deeper is an excellent dvd,This yoga dvd is excellent. Paula Tursi's detailed explaination on the spine and her student that demonstrated the yoga poses was so informative and the visuals added to the understanding of the spine and how it works. I would recommend this also to beginning students as well as intermediate and advanced. I teach yoga and have recommended this dvd to my students to purchase.
5,Fanaa,Excellent soundtrack! I have it burned on my computer so I can listen to it at home and at work and play it in my car almost every time I get in it. Better than 5-stars in my opinion
4,good lotion!!!,great lotion except had a strong smell caused me a headache maybe the fact i dont like the floral smell but overall not bad leaves your skin very silky smooth feeling and a great taning color.I definitely recommend this product.
5,best tanning product out there,"I had tried several several lotions before this one and found that it took longer to see results. The very FIRST time I tried this lotion I saw a difference right there in the tanning room while putting my clothes on. Since the store didn't have the product anymore, I went on line to buy this because the one I bought that was suppose to be sooo great was not as great as Spellbound. I highly recommend it to those looking for fast and lasting results!"
2,If you have sensitive skin this is not for you,I purchased this product to use with the tanning bed and a couple hours after use I broke out into a rash. I do get a nice tan with this product but I have to take a shower right after the tanning bed which is a pain if you have plans afterwards. If you are able to use self tanners regularly than you will be fine with this product and get great results. If you have sensitive skin like me be prepared to have to shower right after use.
4,An absolutely wonderful book!,"A wonderful cookbook featuring the glories of wine. The book contains two sections of essays, one prior to the recipies and one following. The first section of essays deals with the history of wine as food, wine as medicine, and wine in theology, all interspersed with biographical information about the author. The second section of essays, written by another author, deals with ordering wine in restaurants, stocking a wine cellar, and similar subjects. In between, are numerous recipies featuring wine in every course of a meal, along with appropriate recommendations.All in all, a delightful book."
2,What a disappointment,"I wish I had read everyone elses' reviews before buying this. I saw the dvd out and was so excited about getting it for Christmas. As soon as it started I knew it was going to be ""flashbacks"" of episodes that were already on TV. And none of them had anything to do with Christmas. The only bonus on the DVD was the reports done by Gus, Spenelli and Mickey (I love Mickey). They were very funny but not worth the money."
1,Buy another Recess movie,Although we normally love the characters and stories this is an awful movie. The number one thing all parents need to know is mentioned in the official review above. There is a very STRONG message that there is no Santa. If your child believes in Santa do not watch this movie. There is a very subtle suggestion that Santa is real at the very very end. The actual majority of the movie is on non-Christmas short episodes tied together loosely by having the teachers and principle remember things about the kids while stranded in a car stuck in a snow drift. Overall poor quality movie and I am not sure who the target audience would be. Those who believe in Santa will be mortified and those who don't will be bored.
2,Beck / Arnley,"The O2 sensor catolog from B/A had my sensor P.N. cataloged wrong. Turns out, they do not even stock my P.N. yet. I got ahold of the O2 sensor catolog guy at Beck, he was helpful in finding out that the part was wrong but he did not have a P.N. to send me. (He would have if he had it).Partsboulavard (vendor) is taking the part back and promised to credit my account."
4,Low cost of operation,"The Okidata B4400 has got to have one of the lowest cost of operation ratings of any page printer. Text is crisp and sharp, graphics are good. Solid blacks. About 5 seconds to the first page, then 27 pages per minute."
3,Extra details not included in the product description.,"The information about this printer sounds great. It prints great but there are 2 details that I was surprised with and could not find anywhere even when I looked again after my order arrived. The reported time to first page is 5-6 seconds, but that is only true if it is in ready state and not in sleep mode. It takes about 20-25 seconds to come out of sleep mode and print the first page. If it is in ready mode then there is a fan constantly running that is louder than the fan on my desktop computer. This was my first experience with a printer that has any audible fan. Best use would be for frequent printing if you are not sitting next to the printer."
1,Why waste time when there are so many good books out there?,"By far one of the worst books I have ever read, Beachcomber is unbelievable, laughable, and lame. Its characters are far from real, including a virtually incompetent FBI agent, a lawyer/ex-mob-girlfriend who is the poorest heroine I have read in ages, and an assortment of adjuncts, including the villain, who, once revealed, makes you want to grab the author and give her a hard shake - there's no way this could be the ""bad guy"", based on what she's written earlier in the book. Bad writer, bad editor, bad publisher, bad book - can anyone get published these days?"
3,MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,"I look forward to Karen Robards books and ordered this one feeling confident I had another good story from her. Wrong. First of all if you've read any of my reviews you know I hate it when an author falls back on the psycho-torture-women-killer menace. Why not just stick with the mafia as the threat to our heroine? It's almost as if Robards started out with the mafia as the main threat and then couldn't make the story come together. It was very difficult to get into the characters and plot. This is probably the first Robards' book I had to force myself to finish. Let's hope she rushed through writing this book in order to fulfill a publishing obligation so that she could spend more time on her next (hopefully better) book. This was a toss up between 2 stars and 3 stars. Because I like this author, I went with the 3. Everyone is entitled to an off day every once in awhile."
2,Not a Great Choice,The book was a little differnent than what I was expecting. I mean who thinks that animals will actually take over things. The book was a little too bizarre for that subject. Orwell also tried to act as if it were a revolution like the Russain Revolution. I was totally lost personally! I thought that it was a horrible book. No wonder high schoolers hate reading!
2,Intellectualism,"Papus writes brilliantly for his chosen audience: people who like to think, who like to develop very complicated mental maps, people who enjoy to expore the limits of the world while resting in their armchairs.What seems to be missing, in my opinion, is any sort of practical use for this information. He does a so-so job of summarizing the basic principles of the Qabalah (talking about the esoteric and exoteric aspects, discussing basic philosophical issues), but it seems to be a lot of gentleman lecturing without anything of true value to be gained.If one wants to learn about the Kabbalah, it is difficult to go wrong with Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan. The Kabbalah is, after all, so strongly located within the Jewish tradition that to extricate it seems to destroy much of the system. Rabbi Kaplan was an intellectual, a scholar, and an actual practicing Kabbalist."
4,Excellent Disc!,"The Chariot do a great job of taking the best parts of Norma Jean (the former lead singer for Norma Jean is now the lead man of this band) and rocking them out! There is no joking around here and no 15min epics on this disc either, this crew gets down to the business at hand and doesn't mess around. If you were at all disappointed with the last Norma Jean album ""Oh God..."" than this might help you get over that.It's pretty chaotic but no more than Norma Jean, Botch or EveryTimeIDie, so if any of those bands are up your alley and you dig the southern Christian hardcore, this album is for you! This album doesn't exactly break any new ground but it's a strong release in its own right."
3,I'm an Ashlee Simpson fan and I love this album,Seriously if you're into the dope Ashlee Simpson scene than this album is for you. I first heard about Josh Scogin when he worked for the Barnum & Baley circus as a lion imitator. You might call him a side show freak but his talents got him quite a few awards. He even got to perform with Ashlee Simpson at the Superbowl last year. So Josh left the circus and now works for this carnivale called The Chariot. The Circus went on just fine without Josh but they lost a little piece of what made them so great. Josh also lives on just fine without the circus but part of him will always be a part of those acrobats and circus clowns he loved so much.See The Chariot live this year as they open up for Ashlee Simpson.
2,Could have been spectacular,"This cd is, without a doubt amazing. Stars are lost because prior to recording, you would think the guitarist would invest in a damn NOISE GATE for his guitar rig. His tone is crushing & sounds perfect, but the second he stops playing, every time SSSSQQQQQQUUUUEEEAAAALLLLL. It's annoying to the point of only being able to tolerate so many songs at once, because it is a chronic problem in every song."
3,From Battle to War: Change and momentum in ancient warfare,"A. Santosuosso's ""Soldier's, Citizens and the Symbols of War"" neatly synthesizes material usually found in diverse primary and secondary sources. For this reason alone it would be a useful book for university classes in ancient history, particularly at the upper division under-graduate level. Santosuosso writes in a sprightly, easy to follow style that nevertheless has an almost lyrical quality at times. His greatest strength is an ability to show how war and styles of battle affected and were affected by politics, social realities and the personalities of commanders. Altogether a useful and interesting book."
2,I don't have hours to cook!,Hello? Rosie is a professional chef that makes a living cooking for others. I do not have the time or the ingredients to make these recipes. This is a pure Oprah-hype cook book. There are maybe 45 recipes in it and my goodness they take a long time to make. Get real!! Not all of us can afford personal chefs.
5,"The ""Un-fried"" chicken is the best!","The Un-fried chicken recipe alone is worth the cost of the book. Fried chicken has always been one of those things I just don't touch, but this recipe made it possible. Her recipes are beautiful, delicius and low-fat. What more could you want?"
4,light and delicious,"started using this cookbook jan 1. So far ive made 3 of the recipes in it...the cream of broccoli soup, unfried chicken, and angelhair pasta w/ lemon and garlic and love them all. one thing i do not like is that they have some spices listed in the book that i can't find in my grocery store...old bay sng, spike sng etc... so far ive been able to find most ingred. i just hope they don't get too complicated my kids liked the unfried ckn...except next time i'll use boneless ckn i wish that there were more recipes in the book and more desserts"
2,Healthy but kind of bland and some errors,"The recipes I tried were the unfried french fries, unfried crabcakes, and unfried chicken. All were rather bland and needed modifications. The yogurt idea with the unfried chicken was good but it turned out a bit dry and somewhat bland. Maybe less oven time and more spices. The french fries were good but needed a bit more seasoning. The crab cakes needed more egg in order to hold together and were quite dry and tasteless. I like the healthy ideas behind the recipes but they just need more flavor. I probably won't try many more of the recipes given how the first three I tried turned out."
2,Not for beginners,"The recipes all sound appetizing, but you will need time, patience, and skill to implement them. As a working woman, I can't say this book has been at all useful."
4,Not good for non-cooks,"While I overall liked this book, as a 'non-cook,' I sometimes found it hard to follow. If my cooking skills were at a much higher level, I think I would have thoroughly enjoyed it."
2,Grill review,"I purchased a George Foreman grill about 8 years ago that had an adjustable temperature control. After about 6 years of use, the teflon coating started flaking off so I replaced it with this model.I do not like not being able to control the temperature. I grill chicken, fish, and hamburgers on it and it gets way too hot for fish whereas my old one could be set on low and made excellent fish. In fact, I think it gets too hot for everything. Even the chicken breasts start to burn before they are cooked through. I would not buy this again."
3,Works Differently,"Leviton LEDFL-WHT .5 W, 120 V, 3 In 1 Rechargeable Power Failure Light, LED Flashlight and Night Light, WhitePlease be aware that the amber night light, when on, is very bright.Also, when electrical power is interupted to this unit, it is the amber night light that stays on. You must slide the switch on the side of the unit by hand to change to the white flashlight. On several other brands, it is the night light that goes off and the bright white light that comes on automatically when power is interupted."
3,Good little light - except for horrible flickering.,"This is a nice light if you keep in mind that its one of the most inexpensive products of this type on Amazon.The night/emergency light is amber. If you don't want an amber light, you don't want this product. The light is pretty bright and with the amber color I'm not sure I'd put it in a bedroom, but its good for hallways or bathrooms.The flashlight is white and fairly small. It can be manually engaged. I wouldn't use it as a flashlight for working on a car or anything but its handy if the power is out and you need something.Update-Under certain lighting conditions the nightlight with constantly flicker on and off which is very annoying. Most devices of this time have the turn off threshold set above the turn on threshold to prevent this from happening, but it appears this does not. This drops my rating from 5 to 3 stars which is probably generous at that. :("
4,Beautiful,This watch is very attractive. It is more impressive after you open the packaging and get it in your hand. There is some weight to it which makes it seem sturdy. Very sleek lines and the color is neutral yet attractive. My wife enjoys wearing it everyday. It looks good on her too.
4,More than meets the eye,"Not a bad collection of all 98 Transformers episodes, but I feel it should have more. The episodes themselves are worth the effort to get this set, but extras are a little short in my view. After season two, the animated film came out, and afterwards the whole Transformers series changed drastically, so much so that it doesn't even feel like the same series. Some characters died in the film, and never returned, and I feel the movie should have been part of this collection. That would make sense for those who have not seen it, and it doesn't help that its out of print on DVD and hard to find at a reasonable price(in most cases it cost more than this set does). The old TV commercials is a nice addition but parts of the frame are blurred out."
1,What a DREADFUL book! Don't waste your money or time.,"What a mess! The plot is non-existent, there is no suspense, time and place jump back and forth. The writing is sophomoric. No wonder she published under a pseudonym!!!"
1,Terrible,Terrible service from vender. Not properly packaged and had to return 2 sets of 4 glasses due to breakage. Ordered from a different vender and much happier.
3,Elegant but Delicate,"It took three attempts to receive two sets that weren't cracked or chipped during transit. The glasses themselves are simple and elegant, with a solid feel. The biggest downside is I've found the thin lip prone to chipping. If you are looking for an everyday glass, you may want to find something sturdier.Update: Forgot to mention that the Amazon return handling was excellent."
2,"Yes, this is a stupid movie","This movie probably owes more to the Burroughs novels, ""At the Earth's Core"" and some of its sequels, than to the Verne novel whose title it shares. Unfortunately it is poorly done. The premise is silly and the movie does nothing to help you suspend disbelief. The science fiction doubletalk is particularly stupid. I gave it 2 stars rather than one because it is mildly entertaining."
2,Jinny 57,The book is fine for a young beginner or a klutz but I think they will be very disappointed and frustrated by the yo-yo.I would recommend another yo-yo. Perhaps a Duncan Imperial.
5,A Well Written Book,"This is a very good book for any dog-person. The writer is a poet of obvious ability who does not over write, and one who takes the reader into her own life with magical detail. This book ends triumphantly, not sadly for either dog or owner."
3,Johnny Cash Poster,"I was disappointed with this product in two ways. The first was that the seller took as absolutely long as possible to send it and it did not ship quickly at all so I didn't really receive the item until at least two weeks after I'd ordered it.My second complaint is that the poster arrived with visible markings on it! Imagine my frustration when I finally receive it and unwrap it, only to find there are four or five diagonal creases/marks that will never come out right across Johnny's midsection! Will not purchase from this retailer again."
5,Amazing!,"it's Beautiful and very practical, I like it so much, I would recommend to all buy this stuff, you Will not regret."
3,5 min. is all it takes for waves!,"This is a great way to change your style in under 10 min. it takes no time to heat up, and leaves waves in your hair, the kind of waves that look like you just unbraided your hair. Its a nice change of pace every now and then. I have pin straight fine hair, so this tool comes in handy when im bored with my hair!My only commplaint is that it's big and heavy. Its hard to handle because of its weight and Im always afraid im going to burn my ears! Also because of its size It's hard to store anywhere.But all in all, it works. Its quick. It's a good buy."
4,fun hairstyle =),"I like this hair appliance. It gives me a new hairstyle that I looks different. It's not just the same style that's curled at the ends, nor is it the straightened look. I have thick long hair, and it works fine... make sure you crimp little sections though. If you want to make sure your hair will stay and show the curls, you have to add hairspray and gel. If you don't have either, your hair will still be wavy, but it won't be as prominent. It takes a while, so make sure you have a lot of time to get ready! Good luck, and have fun with it :o)"
2,it's okay,"This product is fine but not the best.It's good if you are wearing a headscarf or thick headband.Pros: It heats up VERY quickly and creates nice waves (not crimps) without making hair look dead.Cons: It leaves a very noticeable crease in your hair because of the outside barrel's ""interesting"" design. Also, you have to be sure that you don't hit the ""off"" button while using it."
1,AWFUL Warning!,So the first time I used this product the result was terrible! If you already have thin naturally voluminous hair this will NOT WORK. I started out dividing my hair and did the bottom back of my head and when I got to the top I did the first section. When I released there was a wave but it was so frizzy and puffy I looked like I had a Afro. I pushed it down put some hair spray and continued. I couldn't even finish my hair was so big I had to put a tone of hair spray and use a straightener to fix it. NOT good on my type of hair be warned!
3,Cons.,"I've just bought this product, it arrived today, what I didn't realise is that it wouldn't work in australian electrical plugs, and that I'll need to buy an adapter just to use it. But I've been told even when I do the product might burn out or blow up in my hand. A little confused if it's worth it or not to buy an adapter so I can use this."
2,Handel Broke,I have only used this item a few times even though I bought it a while ago. The last time I used it the handle broke. I think the front of the barrel is too big and the handle is too wimpy! I am looking at getting a new one but will not choose this one! Disappointed.
5,Revlon 3-barrel jumbo waver,gives really nice beachy waves. its fast and easy to do your hair and looks really pretty. i recommend it for people with hair longer than chin length.
1,Not good,Used it once. On the last strand of hair it let out an electrical noise and smoke. Burn my hair off. It got so hot could not use it again.
3,"Ok, too heavy","This waver is to heavy, and the style won't stay for very long. I have to use so much hairspray and even then it goes flat in just a few hours. It also takes a while. It is an ok product, but i wouldn't recommend it."
3,Bigger then I thought,This waver is much bigger then I thought it would be. It is heavy and hard to do my hair with.
4,A Thriller!,"They all say, ""a book you can't put down."" Usually, you put the book down pretty quick! Well, ""Alaska Incident"" IS a book you'll race right through. I read it in a day, whereas a book usually takes me a week.This book does not just appeal to science-fiction types -- you'll like it even more if you're a ""Mystery type."" But this story will make you wonder whether the HAARP/ military catastrophe that's the book'c centerpiece HAS actually happened. Or will?A great read...PS: Do have suggestions for the author, if he interested :-))"
4,Exotic and unconventional,"The difficulty of the fantasy genre is coming up with new variations on a theme. Witcover successfully clears this hurdle, and combines a plethora of familiar cultural icons with some exotic twists to create a wholly enthralling society in conflict with itself. This book is not for children, and is obviously aimed at an adult/college audience which is in and of itself refreshing. The vivid imagery and none too subtle attacks on a variety of contemporary customs, for example plastic surgery, are well mixed to keep the messages from overwhelming the story. Taken in measured doses or all at once, this story captivates, entertains, and provides thought provoking observations on contemporary issues all at once. Looking forward to his future offerings."
5,One Wild Ride,"It's been a few years since I read this book, but I will never forget how much I love it. The characters are strange but compelling. The culture and world he creates are incredible! The themes are deep--religion vs. politics, legend vs. truth, and other themes I haven't thought through yet. It's a really great story with a profound ending that will affect you much more than some happily-ever-after moment. I greatly recommend it."
2,Dont waste your money!,Very Flimsy. The handle and whole trimmer is plastic besides the blade and not a very strong plastic. The trimmer has a hard time cutting 1 sheet of cardstock. It does not provide straight lines. Spend some more money and buy a better trimmer.
2,Mislabeled tracks,"The stars are not for the album, but amazon's mistakes. Beware when you purchase any tracks from this album. At least two of them are mislabeled: Happy Fcuking Birthday and the track following it. Come on, amazon."
3,Enjoy?,"A friend of mine who suggested I get into the root of this type of music told me to get this album. She said they were ""perfect.""1. Girls rate bands by how hot they think the singer is and I was a fool to let my guard down,2. Never again will I listen to someone who DL's random songs from artists and tries to call them ""perfect.""When I first got this album, I was a bit impressed but then it sank in and I though to myself ""What the hell is this dude's problem?""The lyircs are horrible. I'm sorry. The music is not really creative but not bad. I can't get past his accent. I personally perfer Panzer Ag's This is my Battlefield album, although the lyrics in that album are pretty stupid (i.e. ""There is no hell/we are already here"") They are not quite as retarded as Everybody Hates You. If you're looking for something to dance to this should suffice for the first few tracks, but I highly reccomend The Burn Process by TACTICAL SEKT."
4,Good Quality,Arrived on-time and in advertised condition. A bit pricey but hey... Its got the Canon logo!
2,it's ok,"It's ok,meets our expectations,and does is job the way it as to be.We just have to know how to use it under light conditions."
1,Did I read a different book?,"I hate to have to disagree with the other people that have submitted reviews on this book but...I was given this book as a present by someone who knows that I enjoy reading this kind of book. But as far as I am concerned this is the worst book on the subject that I have ever read... and I have read quite a few. I'm sure that the book was given this title just so people would buy it. But when you get into it you realize that the authors are saying that retiring confortably is all but impossible. They also suggest that you should count on living a LOT longer than insurance actuarial tables would predict. Their ""spread sheets"" are terrible.Their conclusions suspect. As far as I am concerned the only good thing about this book is that it made me feel that if this is what passes for investment advise then I should write a book.I can certainly supply much more comprehensive spread sheets."
3,This book is very basic but Good,"This is a good common sense guide to keep on your desk or in your den at home. It is a very basic book, however, the authors are very good and humorous at times in conveying there point of view. I would recommend this book to novices who are starting out in life and too those who are 10-15 years from retirement."
5,Great Show,"This show was great, and should have been given the chance to develop further than it did. This is the last season before it was prematurely canceled by CBS.The acting and story lines were great. If you like westerns than this is a great show to watch."
3,Tricky installation and great service,"Most bubbles were wiped away but a 1mm contour was left ""unglued"" to the screen. The company nicely explained that the relative rigidity of the film needed a couple of days to settle in. And it did. But a bubble remains on the side and never went away. At 15$ a piece, I find this frustrating. It's most probably me that is responsible for this but I find the price for my mistake quite high. Because of the price and consequence of mismanipulation, I would not recommend this product. But I repeat, the service dept. was very quick and thorough in answering my first query."
5,You'll laugh so hard!,"An amazing trilogy on DVD - Jackie Mason: An Equal Opportunity Offender is a great documentary on Jackie and his resurgence, while Jackie on Campus and Jackie in Israel show him to be a timely, worldly entertainer. ""In Israel"" particularly shows how political and current Jackie can be when he drops the shtick. Today's comics can't compare to this genius -- buy this DVD now!"
4,Three In One,"If you are a Jackie Mason fan this a particularly attractive album. The CD really contains three complete presentations. The first is an excellent documentary telling the story of Jackie's meteoric rise and fall...both at the hands of a malevolent narcissistic Ed Sullivan. More gratifying is his amazing return after presenting a one man show in Hollywood thirty years after the ""demise"" of his first career. Then there are appearances in London and Israel. Both display his remarkable acerbic wit as well as his mastery of current events as well as that hilarious talent as a historical revisionist."
4,"one of the best, a funny man","great comic, this dvd gives you 3 shows, all funny. a true pro at work."
1,NOT WORTH IT,"Well what can I say , I was expecting some great Italian Popular music current and Hip, NOT!!!! Well this CD was expensive and not worth the money at all. If you want Hip current Italian music that's on radios now in Italy, than pass this one up!"
3,Fun but small,My daughter wanted a parachute so badly she didn't much care that it is really quite small. She is almost 5 and it is a good size to play with in the house but it isn't much bigger that a tarp. Also does not billow up like the bigger ones do so you can sit under them. It is ok for three people 1 child and 2 adults or better for three kids under 6 yrs. It great for inside for just her and I to play with. I'll keep this one and get a bigger one for outside play that requires more kids. They rip you for the shipping though. There is NO WAY that thing cost 12 dollars to ship. It's the size of a small purse and fits in an envelope inside my mail box. So shipping is ridiculous!
5,great birthday party activity,"Who didn't love this as a kid. I remember it was my favorite thing in gym class. This parachute is well made, has a carrying bag that's large enough to fit the parachute after use (doesn't require map folding). I purchased with several of the tactile balls for playing popcorn at my daughter's 1st birthday party. She will definitely be able to grow with this toy."
1,sony vaio lcd damage,"BEWARE of this product,the screen damages easily and is not covered by sony's warranty-it will cost you up to $500 to have it repaired on top of the$2000 it cost originally.I am of course worried that this will happen again in the future andI continue to carry my Dell with me wherever I go.SONY HAS ANOTHER PROBLEM THE SIZE OF IT""S BATTERY PROBLEM AND WILL HAVE TO ACCEPT THIS SOON"
2,If you don't expect much...,"If you don't expect much from this movie, it won't disappoint you. My son is into anything related to Merlin/Dragons, so this was an easy, cheap pick as a Christmas gift. Don't expect too much from it. Not sure why it's even on Blu-ray. Plot is poor, cinematography is mediocre, acting is so-so. Not one for rewatching."
2,JB's Arrival- Animated Disappointment,When I placed my order it was disclosed that the cover to the battery compartment was missing. That was an acceptable default that could be replaced. however after inserting new batteries and pressing the activation button I realized that although the doll would sing and move its hips...the arms were broken and just lifelessly hanging to the side. Further examination revealed that a nail had been placed under each shoulder of the doll to merely hold the arms in the socket. I thought I was purchasing this item and getting a real deal. Unfortunately it turned out to be a STEAL.
1,GBC electric punch stapler 3230st Dont buy it,"I bought this product and it is the worst thing i ever bought the stapler never worked correctly from the begining i did not have the time to deal with so i was like well at least the 2 and 3 hole puncher still works, but after 3 months the hole thing caought on fire now i cant use it at all. My recommandation dont buy this product it will be a waste of your money."
5,a good book,"The Garret Pi series is an overlooked collection. glen Cook is a great writer who should be given a look. the sereis is a cross between LoTR, Raymond Chandler, and lawrence Block"
3,Not the best in the series but good,"Somehow I missed this when it originally came out. It is back in print and now available again. The characters are a little uneven particularly Winger, but still very good. The plot is a little predictable but again good.A very good read but far from outstanding."
4,Yoga Sculpting for Beginners,I really like this dvd it is very challenging and i was very sore the next day.
3,"okay, but where is the transition?","I found this tape to be fairly easy, great for beginners, not for intermidate yoga students. I was disappointed that there was too much talking and not enough YOGA. This tape has two main sessions, one for upper body about 20 min. (which was a good workout) and the second for lower body about 20 min.(it was okay). If you are looking for a smooth transition from pose to pose this is not the tape for you. There no warm up and forget about your breathing technique."
1,boring and not a good work out,"This was way too slow and not challenging. I would recommend it for elderly people, or people new to working out in general, not just new to yoga."
5,Outstanding Novel!,I think this was an outstanding story from beginning to end and I'm looking forward to the next Donna Hill novel.
1,"Boring, Boring and drawn out","I have read some of this authors previous work, and believe me this is the worst. The book is just so boring, no story line to it."
2,"Two Stars For Two Stars, But What Is This About?!","As a devotee of the stylish and suave Basil Rathbone's Holmes, and a fan of Nigel Bruce's Watson, I would buy this movie if only I knew what it were about. Come on you silly twits at Amazon, more info should be forthcoming if you ever expect to sell this one. There are a lot of Rathbone/Bruce fans out there, and you have managed to annoy us, and insult our intelligence by expecting us to buy it sight unseen. Ain't gonna happen."
3,Feet for the Heater,"Frankly I found it odd the heater didn't come equipped with feet to hold it upright. Nonetheless, they functioned corrected once installed, however the attachment points on the heater body are a little trickey to get lined up for installation. They could be positioned a bit more precicely however they're a necessary item unless you plan to install the heater permanently to the wall."
4,Worried,"I bought these because I do parties and they looked promising but when i pluged them in i noticed that only a couple of the tweeters made noise but i opened them up and reconected everything and the work fine. Over all, good buy."
2,cold solder joints,"IF YOU DON'T MIND REPAIRING THEM, 2 of the drivers in one cabinet, & 3 of the drivers in the other cabinet weren't even connected.had to remove the tweeters and resolder them. IT INFACT WAS COLD SOLDER JOINTS, THAT LOOKED LIKE A CIRCUS MONKEY or they let loose a 5yr old with a soldering iron.AMAZON PACKAGING FOR SHIPMENT HAS GONE BY THE WAYSIDE, INSTEAD OF INCASING THE PRODUCT ALL THE WAY AROUND, THEY PLACE IT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX & PUT BROWN PAPER ELSEWHERE. NOT MUCH PROTECTION FROM SHIPPING. One cabinet corner was smashed !"
5,For those who love to visit a fantasy world and not return!,"""Magic's Pawn"" is the first book in a trilogy by the author Mercedes Lackey. This is the first book I read by her, and the one that enthralled me so much that I subsequently read 17 more books set in her world of Velgarth.It is the story of a young man, Vanyel, who is unaware that he has latent magical powers, and who is taken by his aunt to the city of Haven to be trained as a Herald-Mage, the peacekeepers and judges of Valdemar. He is soon 'chosen' bya Companion, Yfandes, who are horselike creatures of mystical creation, and who bond with the Heralds. In this first book in the trilogy, Vanyel discovers both his newly found powers, and his youthful sexuality, which isa major theme of the book. If you love fantasy and like to laugh, cry, and be truly drawn into a new world, then this is for you!"
2,...Not my cup o' Chava...,"I have to say this outright...this is probably my least favorite Lackey book of all time. the execution is sloppy, the plot is migraine-calibre illogical and most of the characters, especially Lackey's trademark, evil-for-the-sake-of-evil villains, have all the verisimilitude of a B-grade movie. a note to some who want to blame my displeasure on ...ahem, Other Things: I am not a homophobe. I had no problem with Vanyel and Tylendel being gay. their relationship just sort of seemed contrived...like one more burden to throw at our hero, one more thing to make Vanyel more alienated and misunderstood. or, the barely phesable logic in causing the sequence of events which leave him with a nauseatingly grand magical arsenal. The misunderstood adolescent plot is getting wearing after the ""Arrows"" series and (my fault, I will admit) every other SF book I've read in the past year."
3,just like old times,Great game! Same as it was in the 90's but beware there is some tweaking needed to make it compatible with new operating systems. It still works though.
2,Disappointed,"Worked great at first but then the light started flickering, then went out. I changed the bulb and the same thing happened. My husband checked it out and found that the 3-way switch had quit working. So now it's wired to work only on the brightest wattage (which is ok). Thank goodness he knew what to do. I didn't want the hassle of returning it. Wouldn't recommend."
3,Revlon RV978 Perfect Touch lighted mirror,"This mirror has 3 light settings and all are too low. The mirror itself is nice, easy to use, nice magnification, but the low light levels make it frustrating to use. I have to open my curtains and turn on a bunch of lights to be able to use it properly."
4,Lighted makeup mirror,"I've had a mirror like this for the past 4 years. When my mom asked for a lighted makeup mirror for Christmas, I searched the stores, but liked this one so much better than the ones available in stores. I ended up purchasing it online for less money than those offered in the stores."
4,"Dated feel, but what a triumph of a pop alubum!","There are many ways to describe this surprising electro-pop release by Lucia, the screaming siren of KMFDM. [...] Take a singer known for screaming and put him or her in an electronic song production. Ron Halford almost succeeded where Lucia soars here. To be fair, Lucia has the advantage of sounding as good as Shirley Manson or Toni Halliday (who knew, right?), and she keeps the CD sounding fresh and not embarrassingly bad (J-Lo or late Cher album this is not). It's rock, dance, pop, and some goth. If you like garbage and Curve, you will love this CD. It even has an Eric Bazilian (""What if God was One of Us,"" The Hooters) song that does not suck. So go figure. The brunette who ""screams like a banshee"" on the KMFDM discs has a solo CD that is as good as any dark electronic pop release from the mid 90's. It is a wonderful CD to discover."
4,Awesome Musical Journey!,"Wow! I bought this album having only heard a few soundbytes of a few songs and figured why not give it a try. I had never heard of Lucia before but found her through a similar artists search from metal bands (KMFDM). Her music has a dark yet fragile melodic mix to it that is hard to compare. I am usually more a metal/goth/darkwave kind of guy, but this is beautiful. My favorite tracks include: So Clever, Fear, and Monkey Puzzle Tree. Don't be cheap, give it a try!"
5,It's awesome,"I saw the Piano Princess in Atlantic City and I was invited to play piano with her on stage. She was amazing. No one can express the emotion of the show on the ivories like she can. It's relaxing, yet it keeps you on the edge everytime. There isn't one song on this CD that isn't good. If there was one CD of Phantom that's a must have, it's definetly this one!"
4,good but not great,R.A. Salvator weaves a stunning tale of war and the heroics therein. Tied in with a tale of true love pulling through the tough times in life. He could however have done things differently to make this book better. I recommend this book to anyone.
2,windham pointe side elastic shorts,Would not buy more due to front pockets being too short and mymoney clip and change falling out whenever I sit down.
5,excellent biblical study of the subject of suicide,"This is an extremely insightful book into the mind of suicide- prone individuals. It also gives the cure for these tendencies by examining exerpts from the Bible, and applying them to the problems which potential suicide victims face.It is NOT just another ""don't worry-be happy"" book. It acknowledges the heartfelt and often legitimate pain which these people feel, and offers actual(Bible-based)methods by which to overcome the suicidal urge.Highly reccommended to everyone, even if you are merely ""down-in-the-dumps"", and not suicidal.Also reccommended is ""Have You Felt Like Giving Up Lately?"", also by David Wilkerson."
1,No Way,"The lessons in this book are extremely advanced. If you do Pilates, and enjoy it, this is for you. This is NOT A BOOK FOR A BEGINNER."
3,"Good model, needed more",This is a good starter model. Simple and easy to build. It did feel a little lacking. There not much to it. Its got some details like spair treds. It does cost a little more than I feel it should. But if you like building models you still can't go wrong with this one.
1,not the same thing,What I recieved is not what the picture shows! Could not pick what month I needed. It did not come close to what i was looking for.
4,yoga-at-home,"Another good Yoga Zone dvd. The two workouts focus on gentle stretches and twists of the spine to help you work out any muscle aches and build good posture. The instructors emphasize being ""mindful"" of how you move into the poses using your breathing as a guide, rather than forcing the pose (which leads to injury). One instructor gives the cues and shows the modification while the other instructor demonstrates the perfect form that you can work towards. I've really noticed a difference in my posture, especially my lower back."
3,Healthy Back in the Short Term,"This video and instructions are good but it is way too short, 20 minutes. I like the fact that one can choose to listen to the music without the verbal instructions."
3,More strenous than I thought it would be,I bought this because I'm having back and shoulder problems (had shoulder surgery ~6 months ago). This actually caused me to have more muscle problems in my shoulder area....shoulder wasn't strong enough for some of the poses.
2,Douglas instructor is REALLY ANNOYING RUINS the WHOLE VIDEO,I wanted to like this video...it was recommended to me by a friend. The first portion of the video with two female instructors was fine...a bit stiff but the second section with Douglas as instructor was so annoying I could hardly stand it!!! He speaks in a whiny voice and tells Suzanne - That's Niiiiiiice and That's beautiful Suzanne too many times. It honestly ruined the entire video for me - I will NOT recommend this video to anyone...I also bought the Yoga Zone Ultimate set which i have not tried yet but really hope that Douglas is not a part of those videos!
1,Dissappointed,"Not satisfied because there are no pictures of the birds....was in Puerto Escondido Mexico last season and saw so many birds, so bought this book for the next trip, but no pictures ! My local bird book in New York has all the pictures, which I think is key identifiying the birds....words just are not the same ....the book is so dry without colored pictures compared to other birding books....."
1,Warning! Corel Photo Album locks you in,"Photo Album 6 seems fine as a program, but it automatically saves every photo as a Corel Photo Album 6 file. You cannot save as a .jpg or .bmp. This means that if you need to send a photo to someone as a .jpg, you're out of luck. A recipient who doesn't own Photo Album 6, may have problems working with the file. I have tried to get information from Corel on how to save photos as .jpg's but they charge a $25 fee for technical support. I finally uninstalled the program, but all my photos are permanently Photo Album 6 files. They are pulling a sneaky way to hold your images hostage, so that you'll always have to use Corel and pay for their upgrades. Shame."
2,"So Far, Not So Good","I purchased this product new for my mom and sister-in-law with no grand expectations about what I had ordered. Imagine my surprise then when one of the products arrived in a re-used bubble envelope (folded inside-out with the previous customer's name in the return address line) and the other in a regular USPS Priority Mail box. If this was the only issue, I would not have bothered writing a review but the CD itself came in an unmarked paper envelope without any packaging, leading me to wonder if this product was really new.I have come to expect better of Amazon and do not think the vendor and distributor should be showing a picture of a software package in promoting this item since what you see is not what you get.As for the merits of this product, the jury is still out but so far its seller and Amazon have left a bad first impression."
4,A little too slow sometimes,I liked everything about this product except it is a little too slow at times. I always shoot with Nikon RAW format. It has hung a couple of times and I had to kill it after waiting for 10-15 minutes.
5,great ac.,"I bought 2 of these units to go into my slider windows. They are great, quiet and get the house cold quickly. The install was pretty simple too. I highly recommend this unit. Make sure you open the boxes and check them when they arrive. The first 2 came out damaged, but were replaced with undamaged units. There was a bit of a time delay to get this fixed because I live on the west coast and these units were truck shipping from NY. The company was good and offered 30% off to keep the damaged units (started at 10% and went up to 30%), but I wanted non damaged, so they promptly sent the new ones."
5,Great Product,"Product, price and delivery service was great, so good I bought a second unit a week later"
1,Disappointed,"Although the shakers are cute they are much smaller than they appear in the picture. Now that I read the description, no where does it say how big they are. I am very disappointedand was hoping for a larger set. If these are 3-4 inches that's alot."
4,Another Excellent LP Book,"Written in the same style as all the Lonely Planet books, this book enabled us to plan a fantastic holiday to Tonga. The information was precise and exact, and laid out in an easy to use arrangement with helpful section headings. My normal complaint about guidebooks is that the maps are often worthless, but here they were accurately drawn and had all the relevant places correctly marked. Although two years since being published we didn't find any information that was drastically out of date. If you are travelling to Tonga this is the guide to buy."
3,"Overpriced, but you can get the knock-off...","Ok, I can't fairly review these because I only bought the apparently identicalInsignia NS-2908 2.0 Portable USB Speaker SystemThose Insignia speakers are obviously exactly the same by all measures that I can tell. They're much cheaper. Anyway, I compared these to my CA-2988 speakers which are single-speaker, more portable, and have a 3.5mm input. I really appreciate the 3.5mm input more than the USB audio because it is more flexible in terms of software routing. Though the CA-2988 needs USB power, it could come from a wall charger/adapter and they can otherwise work with any device. The CA-2988 is definitely a little quieter and not quite as nice, but is much smaller and more portable.For the price I paid for an out-of-box set of the Insignia knock-offs (under $15!), these 2908 speakers are worth it. I wouldn't spend $60 on them though, no way."
3,Barely OK Speakers.,"I bought these during the lighting deal for $20. I wished I had just bought another HP USB mini speakers instead. The sound is okay, except drum kicks and bass are weak. They're not exactly that portable. It's only portable because it comes with a case. I think I was more impressed with the case."
2,Great portable speakers for medium size room,"I bought these to connect to my laptop when I do presentations that require sound. They fit in a tiny case that slips into my suitcase easily. Connect via USB to Win7 with no setup. Sound quality and features are EXCELLENT in a medium size room. If the listeners will be more than 25 feet from the speakers, I had to turn the volume up to the point where it distorts. As a result I use professional speakers in a large room and these in a medium room. They stand up vertically on a table using built in fold out stands which are great. they require no power cord. Only one plug to USB(from one of the speakers . . . the two are connected by a cord)."
1,Opie woulda made a better film,"Took a girl to the drive-in to see this one(GTA)and we couldn't believe how bad it was, so we did what we came there for anyway. But I remember us commenting on how terrible it was. You would be better off buying ""Hot Rods To Hell"". Its terrible too but its still cool."
1,Mom,"After 3 days of my daughter wearing these boots the buttons fell off. Cheap, cheap, cheap!Would not recommend these boots."
3,Fell apart!,I had these for a week and they starting separating at the toe. I had to return them. They were very comfortable the short time I had them.
3,Cute but not as soft on the inside!,Good boots for the price. If you can afford emu or ugg they are much softer and more cozy on the inside! However these boots have a better sole and bottom then my emus!
5,Comfortable and warm Bearpaw Abigail Boot,"This boot is just what you think it will be - like walking on a pillow. They are a little clunky though for me - always feel like I'm tripping on carpets and such because the sole is so large, but that's my issue, not a boot defect. And I bought mine to slug around the house in - being able to step outside to take out the trash without changing my shoes. I usually wear a size 8.5 and ordered a 9 and they fit snug but not too tight. Definitely snuggly and warm. Great for New England winters!"
3,Good got the price,I guess you get what you pay for. They are not as nice as Uggs but are comfortable and fit well. I bought the Ugg insole and that made them more cushy.
5,Bearpaw women's Abigail boot,"I love my new boots! They are true to the size and very very comfortable. I can't wait to wear them in the snow. These boots are made well, they're giving uggs a run for its money!"
3,not true to the size,Bought this boot for my daughter at Christimas. She loves the boot and style but it runs small.Very disappointed because I ordered a size 9 which is her true size and it's too tight. They don't come in half sizes and the size 10 will be too big.
1,I dont like it,"This pair shoe is looks very nice,but when you get it, just check the shoes carefully.I got the pair shoe, one shoe is missing button,(should have two buttons, but only one on the left side shoe)And the under sole is thinner than the UGG.the size is fit and it is comfortable too, but I wont recommend to buy this shoe on the amazon.because there are many troubles for return process for this item,taking long time to connect the seller, but still do not solve the issue."
1,HORRIBLE,I loved these shoes for the first 2 weeks until i was walking to the store and two of the buttons fell off. Im so pissed that i spent so much money on these shoes and they are falling apart. I keep trying to return them and amazon wont let me. NEVER ORDER BEARPAW FROM AMAZON!
2,White lining shows,The boots aren't a bad fit but all of the lining on the outside (the front seam that shows on top of the foot). It isn't black but shows up white so it makes it look cheap. I'm trying to figure out a way to maybe dye it black or something. Also the lining inside isn't soft but feels rough and cheap. Looks okay but I'm not very satisfied with the product.
3,Runs very small,"Had to return these as they ran very small. I am a size 7 or 7.5 shoe/boot. I ordered these in 8 and they were very small even without any socks. My toes were crumpled in up against the front of the shoe. When I returned these Amazon could not give me the option of exchanging for a larger size because the price had gone up $12 which is disappointing. The boots seem great, but be warned they run very small. The calf part fit great."
3,Soso,"The quality is different from last time I bought. I don' t know why, inside the fur is not what I want"
1,horrible,these boots are horrible. i got one pair and a week later 2 buttons popped off. then they sent me another pair and one the strings that holds the buttons was half off. i wore them once. never again will i order boots from amazon
5,Great Boots,"I bought these for my 12 year old daughter since I didn't want to spend the money on Uggs. I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews where people claimed they were defective or looked used. Mine arrived in perfect condition. The price was much better than in the stores, and the larger choice of colors is nice. I order the navy which is a very dark navy, but they should go great with jeans. Can't comment on durability yet, but they seem like they will hold up (after I waterproof them) and the buttons seem to be fastened securely."
5,These Are Awesome Boots!!,Been looking for awhile! Ended up with these and LOVE them! hands down they are warm and comfy! And pretty true to size. I wear a 8.5 or 9 and bought the 9. They fit great!
1,dissatisfied customer for Bearpaw boots,"the color of the boots did not match each other, the fur was also inconsistent between the two boots and the size was off a lot, size 5 should normally be too big for my granddaughter, but they were too small."
5,Perfect,"This is my second pair of boots made by BearPaw, and i love both pairs! They are very durable and comfortable. Exceeds expectations for the price."
2,Not as nice as Emma Boot,"Thought I'd save a few bucks and try these after enjoying my Emma boots. These have a markedly different lining - not curly, classic sheepskin like Emmas, rather they have short, straight, furry lining that does not have the plush, luxurious feel of curly sheepskin.Disappointing..."
4,"very comfortable, warm and stylish","I love them. They are nice and warm, very comfortable and stylish. The fit is good, tad bit on the tight size."
2,disappointed,Definitely too small. Follow the other reviewers and order a size up. They did seem warm and comfy but not sure if I'll order again.
2,Quickly damaged boots,"The toggle buttons broke off on each of the boots within a week of wearing them. I contacted the company and have yet to hear back on whether they will fix or replace them. Very disappointed! Because they are not unopened, I cannot work with Amazon to return the damaged boots."
3,"""What do you plan on doing? Find the pieces ,try to fit them back together."".","The reviews and the helpful votes are all over the place for this DVD.There are two things to consider if you are thinking about getting this DVD.First ,the movies themselves, which get good reviews and second, the quality of the DVD itself.I had no trouble with ""Hondo And The Apaches"" at all.In fact, it is excellent,with a great storyline,lots of Indian involvement,lots of action,and well acted.However;as to ""The Man Called Moon"",it seems it is also a very good movie ,but there is something wrong with the DVD itself.In fact mine wouldn't play at all.So,what you get here is a ""Buyer Beware"""
5,Favorite!,One of our favorite Justin Matott books. The message is wonderful and the illustrations are beautiful (don't forget to find the mouse on every page).
3,"Not great, but fun","Among the 16 tracks on this CD are some by the Communards, Sylvester, Bronski Beat, Soft Cell, Gloria Gaynor, Culture Club, and Eartha Kitt. But the hilight of this collection has to be ""Crucified"" by Army of Lovers."
2,Buyer beware! You truly get what you pay for!!!,"I am extremely disappointed with these chips. I had expected them to be ""premium"" chips as the description portrays. However, what I received was just a heavier version of the plastic chips that we already have! This purchase was to be a birthday present for my husband and now I am going to have to spend double the amount to get some real chips! You really do get what you pay for!"
1,died after 1 use,it worked fine the first time. then a month later the power was much lower. so low that it wouldn't cut without snagging the hair. it wasn't the outlet because i tried it in another house and on different outlets. I threw it out in disgust.
1,You get what you pay for. I paid for junk.,"I don't have much to say. They don't work. It took me 30 minutes just to cut my son's hair. It would have been better to just use scissors. Oh well, I bought them cheap, and got my money's worth I suppose."
1,no good,"I bought this book after hearing about the Dead Sea Scrolls from a friend. I expected something exciting but found to my dissappointment that this book is a dull read. It is mainly for people who are knowledged in arcaeology and the middle east. Hodge focuses to much on the site of the findings of the scrolls rather than the scrolls themselves. Of all the books out there, on the Dead Sea Scrolls, I would pick another one. Especially if you're not familiar with the subject."
2,made in china,"disappointing when i seen made in china not as good quality as i have seen in other kershaw products, really like the gut hook heavy and sharp the knife blade is nothing special and i didn't need the saw but it is heavier than i expected Now the locking mechanism is horrible. it could open at any time allowing the blade to come out. for that reason i would NOT recommend..."
5,Too HOT,"I'm holding the CD right now, and my hand it BURNING UP. It's the Midwest Swing, ya'll. DAMN, Just go and get it, just get up and go buy it."
5,lunatic_land24:7,"this album is by far one of the greats of debut album out of the groups. The lunatics are hot streak and will never lose the streak. With beats and lyrics from S.T.L and midwest swing it's speaks for itself. This is one hot album to get and is worth getting. Murphy lee, Ali, and Kyjuan, including Nelly,are representin' St. Louie and dtill at it, also check out the solo album of Ali ""heavy starch"", it hot as well"
4,solid debut,"To be honest with you....i disagree with the 7 million people who bought nellys record....i dont think he is that nice....he is just a gimmick......his voice gets annoying about the third time you here it......so im sure a lot of yall are mad at me, but wait....when nelly rhymes with the lunatics it gives a little somtin somtin different..which makes nelly sound not as bad. The other cats in the group are coming on some straight up thug rhymes which makes this cd pretty dope on that level. I dont see this cd blowing up like nellys did though....its not as catchy...but its more consistent....the beats are basically the same style...but i gotta say i enjoy hearing it much more than country grammar.....best track?? STL.....starting out the cd with straight heat!!! Nelly fan or not, go cop this record....its a good summer cd.....one"
4,From Mouse to Mermaid,"I had to order this book for my EWS class. Honestly, I thought this would be another one of those boring books I had to torture myself to read; that is, just by judging by the cover. As I was reading it, I found myself to be enjoying this book quite a lot. I agreed to a lot of the points made in the articles and I really do hope that EWS professors would choose this book for the class. Lesson learned? Don't judge a book by its cover."
1,For WASPs only,"If you feel the need to believe that White Anglo-Saxon Protestants alone are God's chosen people, you will love this book. The authors seem to have taken every quote they could find -- mostly from WASP politicians -- that contained the words ""Bible,"" ""God,"" and/or ""Christ"" and presented them in no particular order and with no particular logic. In a world that is predominantly non-Christian and non-white, this strikes me as not only insensitive, but absurd. If you have an open mind and an all-encompassing spiritual focus, you will definitely want to give this book a pass."
2,EXPENSIVE SHIPPING - Product is as advertised,"Wire loom is wire loom - just make sure this product meets your heat and diameter specs. In this case, at $10 for 50 feet it was the cheapest available. The ONLY reason I rated it so low is because shipping was 72% of the cost and the item was not double packaged and was only shipped with a shipping sticker on the outside of its original packaging AND the item was shipped late and arrived late. In addition, since I ordered two, I was charged twice for the shipping cost when the boxes were merely taped together and a shipping sticker was slapped on the outside."
2,Black & Decker Grass Shears,"Seems cheaply made, it is hard to hold back the safety switch & push the button to operate the shears. I don't use shears often, so will muddle through. Not as good as my last pair, they were another brand."
2,Poor Quality Blades,The old blades they use to make before 1998 for this unit were top quality and would last you like 50 yard cuttings. The ones you pick up today only last like 8 yard cuttings before they get dull. They are very hard to sharpen with a file or dremel tool. I cannot get them to sharpen right so I'm forced to buy new blades often. The battery life is avg 30 - 45 mins.
3,Shears,"I was disappointed in the life of the battery. After less than a year, I had to take the shears to a repair depot to have the battery replaced. Now, again, the unit is not functionable because the battery is dead."
1,Cordless Grass Shear,Was unable to use item since I have a bad back. The extension handle was never set for this item. I would not have ordered this item if I knew I would not get the extension handle.
1,Wasted money,"Design is poor as it gives me a cramp to hold the safety button AND the power button at the same time. But I never have the cramp for long since the battery doesn't hold a charge worth a sou. After just a few minutes cutting the battery loses enough power that the blades won't cut through anything thicker than air. Now after just a couple of years of light use the battery is completely dead. No replacement batteries available anywhere except ""authorized repair"" shops. My guess is that it would cost as much to replace the batteries as it did to buy the shears in the first place. I'm sorry I bought these."
5,we need the la ley unplugged in dvd format,La Ley MTV Unplugged...should be in dvd technology.MTV...whats going on?? do you think that La Ley doesn't sale?Guess what...one of the greates bands in spanish rock ever.
5,Rubs it in the right places!,"Works as advertised! Variable speed is helpful in areas that need deep massage. Instructions are great and helpful --- be sure to read these. Weight of Thumper is plenty to do the job and does not require added pressure to get the full effect. I generally get a massage weekly by a professional and have used him for the last 5 years. He suggested the use of the ""Thumper"". It relaxes me quicker in the necessary areas which makes the massage from the pro more effective and quicker to the point! Great Product!"
2,Maybe I got a defect? It doesn't matter now.....,"After 25 days of use, the tank started to leak at the seam. I initially called CS for Air O Swiss and they required me to jump through hoops to get a replacement. First I called CS and they gave me a RMA, CS then had me email the RMA to the ""inquiries dept"" to see if I was eligible for a return, I was told it would be around 7 days to get a response......yea right. I clicked a few times in Amazon and I had a replacement 2 days later with the shipping for the return paid for. I love Amazon! I am currently using the replacement with no troubles so far. 2 stars for HORRIBLE customer service from Air O Swiss."
1,Not good with hard water,We've gone through 2 of these expensive units at this point. We have hard well water and with daily use this unit lasts about 3 months and then there are so many mineral deposits on the membrane that it no longer produces vapor.
4,You've been waiting for this.,"A long-time fan of the Vagina Monologues, I just HAD to get The Good Body when it came out. Everyone has issues with body image, but no one addresses it quite like Eve Ensler. I just hope that I can see this on stage someday."
1,These taste so bland.,"Look, each pack contains two servings of 120 cal each, yet those servings serve up exactly zero taste. They should make it one serving of the same number of calories but inject some taste. They taste like someone forgot 1) salt and 2)sugar. Wow. Super bad."
3,"Delicious cookies, but not single serving packs","Let me start by saying that I really like these cookies. If you're going to give your child cookies, these are not so bad healthwise. However, the size leads you to believe that one bag contains a single serving, when it actually contains 2 servings at 120 calories each. That's a bit too many calories in a snack for a young child, I think. I buy snack packs so that when I'm on the go, I can open a bag and hand it to my kid. I don't feel that I can do that with these."
5,You're never too old for animal crackers,"Barbara's Snackimals make me feel like a kid, but now that I'm a bit older, it's nice to know that these are a bit healthier. The oatmeal variety taste great and have a unique texture. I prefer the snack-sized bags, otherwise I'd eat the whole thing!"
5,Snacks,"Very tasty cookies. Good size portion for lunch pails or to take along. Chocolatey taste, good price. Shipping was fast as well. We love them and as far as cookies go, they are healthier than most AND taste great."
2,"Sad, sad, indeed.","A friend told me about this band and I was really excited. But this wasn't very good. It sounds like stuff my brother does with his computer and not at all professional. I guess I was looking for something different. I'm not saying this band is the worst band ever, but they aren't great either."
5,great feel good recipes,"this is a great gift for anyone needing some feel good recipes, i have tried several and they are awesome, i love this cookbook!"
5,We love this product,I love this product. It moisturizes the skin. It smells great without being overpowering. The whole Skin Milk line is fantastic.
3,Moderate,"I like advanced fitness dvd's and this one wasn't hard enough for me. I like the way you can choose which section you want to do, standing or floor. I usually use this after another workout as a little added bonus. If you are a beginner or intermediate this dvd will work well."
5,Love Marsland Style?,"I love the Love American Style reference below and just had to somehow connect with it somehow here. Hence the above title.That said, what you have to know about this album is that it's kind of like a greatest hits album from a parallel universe: It goes from one unbelievably good song to the next. You've probably never heard any of these, but once you do you will come back for more -- time and time again.Am I to believe that these guys started out with punk aspirations? Maybe, but the styles here are melodic pop with a fairly good sized dollop of classic R&B; sensibilities.If you really want to spoil yourself, buy this one and Marsland's ""You Don't Know Me."" They seem like companion pieces, although I would be hard pressed to rate one higher than the other. Well, maybe Ludlow gets a couple of points docked for the two throw-away tracks at the end, but the unbroken string of keepers that preceeds those more than makes up for the dif'."
1,Call them before you order anything!!,Got the wrong item and the wrong quatity based on their add. When contacted all they did was give me my money back...cheap way out of fixing a problem...I do not recommend them.
5,EdgeHog,"Great price! It works to my satisfaction,very powerful.will most likely buy more items from this person. Thank You,Johnny U Does the job intended to do."
2,Not as good as previous versions,"Let's start off with the good:-Well powered-Easy assembly-Simple and effective cord retainerThe bad:-I'm 6'2"" and have to stoop to use it. It's made for someone about 5'10"" max.-The edge guide does not follow the concrete. You have to use the left hand handle to pull the edger to the side so it stays in a straight line. So now I'm stooping and applying a force perpendicular to the direction I'm going.-If the edge guide happens to follow the concrete, the blade is spaced so far from it, that it doesn't catch everything and you have to go back and forth over it until you randomly get it.-I've been hanging it by the handle in my garage and the plastic is cracking under it's own weight."
3,LE750 Edge Hog,I have now used this product three times.1. The edger is easy to use and make adjustments.2. The soil must be relatively dry or clumps of dirt stick in the edger.3. The edger is easy to clean.4. It tends to pass thru thick clumps of grass instead of cutting thru them.5. With practice it is easy to cut in a straight line.6. I find I have to pull the cut grass after I pass thru. I had expected the edger to cut the grass cleanly.7. There is adequate power in the unit.
4,Good edger,This edger does a good job. It is much quieter than the previous black and decker I owned. The front wheel adds stability and makes it easier to use.
4,B&D Edger LE 750,"Quiet, powerful, lightweight and easy to use. Does a fantastic job with regular edging; landscape edging is good but not great."
3,black and decker le750 edge hog,"this product might be fine to edge along sidewalks but does not edge beds well. the blade does not dig deep enough to even ""refresh"" already edged beds."
5,A second purchase,I had purchased one of these almost 30 years ago. It still ran so I stuck with the same brand. It's easy to use and does a fantastic job.
1,Terrible Edger,"This is a terrible edger and does not do a good job at all. I have had this over a year, so I have had plenty of experience with it. I have had to use it in trenching mode to even get it to edge. I do not recommend this product, and recommend getting a gas edger instead. I wish I had never gotten it and am now looking for a decent edger that can do the job."
1,No replacement for gas!,"I think most of the people giving this edger a 5 star rating have not had a gas edger. Coming from a gas edger I was dissapointed in the power and cutting ability of this edger. I had one of the little two-stroke gas edgers before this one and I thought I would try electric but I was sorry I did. Even the little bitty gas edger put this one to shame in power and cutting quality. This edger only cuts about 60% of the grass and the rest it pushes away! It makes the job harder to because it barely has enough power making you the operator put forth more work to get it through the grass. It does not cut nearly as sharp an edge as a gas edger either. I took mine back to Lowes and got there 5 HP 4 cycle Model 554 Troy-Bilt for $250.00 and boy am I glad I did. Effortless power, easy to start, no cord hassel, and way a better cutting job. I tried electricity and I am back to gas. If you haven't tried gas you owe it to yourself to try one. You will never go back to electric.Dennis Mau"
1,Return Policy,"Iam unsucessfully trying to return this Edger, Been sent on a goose chase and Bic isn't taking incoming calls do to inventory? I have left 5 messages and e-mailed them concerning their policy on returning items, they haven't bothered to return my mail or calls. I am not happy with the short handle on this edger nor the strength of the machine."
1,Black & Decker LE750 Edger,"I find this edger does remain in the edger position when in use. I have to shift it back to the edger position about every 10 feet,"
4,B&D Edgehog,"Only used it once, but very satisfied. As mentioned in the instructions, the first cut was a bit more difficult - to be expected - the lawn hadn't been edged in some time - but it was not nearly as hard as they said it would be and the edge was mainly crisp and clean. Great little edger!!!!"
1,Does not work in Florida,Real easy to assemble but the grass was over the driveway about three inches in places. I figured this would be real easy. Wrong I made five passes going slow back and forth and it only cut about 50% of the grass that needed edging. Not a good purchase if you have St. Augustine grass
4,good edger for the money,"Received the product in the time promised. The edger, black and decker, was easy to assemble. used it several times so far, and i'm very happy with it. the price was certainly right. i recommend it."
1,Better off with a bucket of hot water,"I purchased this as a gift for my girlfriend and we've found that the money could've been spent better on a bucket. The problems we have with the foot bath are that it is loud, a bassy, vibrate the joists, type loud. We've tried dampening the vibrations by using blankets and towels underneath, and that works to some extent, but then you've got a tub of water on an unstable platform. This foot bath was one of the least expensive that I looked at. I have a feeling other foot baths would give a similar experience to this. If I had to do it again, knowing what I know now, I wouldn't purchase this, or any other foot bath for that matter, again."
5,Cordless Electric Shrub Pruner,"We purchased this item recently for our large yard. We have a wide array of shrubs and ground covers. The shrubber did an excellent job shaping overgrown shrubs and trimming woody rosemary ground cover. It worked equally well removing spent flowerheads from perenials. The shrubber is lightweight yet powerfull and was easy to manuver and control even on hilly locations and hard to reach corners. The lock off switch that assures that the power is off is an important safety feature. We are purchasing a second ""Black & Decker Shrubber"" so my husband and I don't have to fight over the one we already have. Speeds up pruning and avoids sore hands and wrists from too much manual trimming. Great gardening tool--highly recommended!"
1,Worth Repairing?,"I liked the shrubber initially, and even bought the extension handle attachment for using it overhead. This product seized up frequently, and the last time it remained seized even after I picked away the plant material. I cannot figure how to take the blade apart to clean it. I thought about taking it to the local Black & Decker store for repair, but the store is no longer around. I visited Amazon with the intention of buying a new unit which would probably be cheaper than repairing this unit. However, reading the reviews reminds me about the seizing frequency and frustration, so perhaps I should not throw good money after bad."
3,shubber,does not work that great. better to buy a much bigger model. arrived on time or it would have gotten a 1 star.
4,I wish there no non-stick surface. Plain stainless steel.,"I just wish they don't put this unhealthful non-stick surface on every thing, especially on this skillet."
5,Easy to use and read- and my doc loves it!,So I bought this as a gift to myself for Christmas and I think it's great. It's easy to use and the screen is HUGE so the reading is large and very easy to see. I'm not old but it's helpful to have things so simple! It comes with two cuffs too so in case you need a larger size it's already included.The price is fair and all the features make it better than anything else I researched.
4,a Fantasy: meeting a hot movie star in Tuscany,"SEP's writing is the usual witty, fast, and funny. I love how light her books are, and the lines are never boring.This book is such a fantasy. The heroine,Isabel Favor, suffered major setbacks in her love life and her bank account, and those events led her to rent a little place in Tuscany. Then all of a sudden, life is looking up, better than what it was before!!! I love the optimism.The real fantasy is meeting and getting to spend a lot of time with a hunky movie star bad boy. As if living in Tuscany and eating Italian food constantly weren't enough to bring a woman back to life!I love the kiddie characters in the book, the author captures their fun essence."
5,My favorite Phillips!,"What a fun romp through the Italian countryside - sun, landscape, food, passion, and more. Interesting subplot underlies a not-so-mysterious mystery and a tale of passion between two seemingly incompatible people. I loved this book from the smoldering piazza scene, to Ren and Isabel's sun-lit grape tasting. A fun change of pace from previous Phillips books."
1,more publishers' greed,"Before you buy this book be aware that it is only 384 pages of large print [in the regular edition] with large spaces between the lines and large margins. It will make a nice sized ... paperback, but a $[more expensive] hardbound book? no way"
3,"A good read, but expected better","As a big fan of British romantic comedy writers Christina Jones and Katie Fforde, I was looking forward to reading a book by Susan Elizabeth Phillips have read nothing but glowing reviews of her work and having had her books recommended by every romance reader I know.I found Breathing Room to be enjoyable and funny in places. SEP has a wonderful turn of phrase and she has written some one liners which made me laugh out loud, but I just didn't enjoy it as much as the works of Jones and Fforde. I found the sub plots of the stolen fertility symbol ludicrous and the story of Tracey and her husband to be boring and rather unnecessary. The romance of Ren and Isabel was well-written and well developed but the silly sub plots detracted from my enjoyment of the book.But as Phillips did make me laugh, I shall definetly pick up another book by her where I hope that she will be as good as the reviewers and reader reccomendation say she is."
2,Sadly disappointing,"I am a huge Susan Elizabeth Phillips fan -- Hot Shot; Heaven, Texas; Honey Moon...but this one was a major disappointment. I didn't care one iota about the characters and had to force myself to finish the book -- something that has NEVER happened to me with one of Ms. Phillips' novels. I just hope I remember how disappointed I was with this book when her next one comes out in hardback."
2,"Out of all her books, the worst","I am a huge fan of Susan Elizabeth Phillips and after reading only 2 of her books, I will buy any of her books without any hesitation because she has never failed to disappoint. However, ""Breathing Room"" is the exception. I couldn't wait for this book to be over. The story wasn't believable enough and her characters didn't have much depth or charm to them. I was so disappointed. In my opinion, her best are ""Kiss an Angel,"" ""Lady Be Good,"" ""Natural Born Charmer,"" and ""Just Imagine."" The sex is hot, the stories are so great and the characters are just people to root for. Skip ""Breathing Room."""
4,Pretty good for an expansion pack,"Its great not to have to worry about sending the kiddies off to school or going off to work each day. One drawback, the characters in the parks and hotels are so annoying... You will have fun with this one...=o)"
3,A real disappointment,"I feel like I wasted 30 plus dollars on this expansion pack. I think it is really boring. First off, so what you can go on vacation. The lots are all too similar. Sure, you can make your own lots and download (FREE) stuff from the web. But all it does is boost up your interest for a few weeks. These expansion packs are basically money making schemes that provide little punch to the consumer. If you have to choose between HOT DATE and VACATION get HOT DATE. I think I will save my $ and get future expansion packs when they get cheaper. (maybe) It is about time Maxis reduces the price of House Party and Living Large. How greedy are they at EA? They have the Sims packs, SimsOnline and PS2 game coming out. Try reducing your prices on some of the older packs. All in all, after 2 years, I am bored with THE SIMS. Vacation did little to change that."
2,The thought of it was fun,When i got sims vacation i was so excited but after my first 2 vactions it got really boring. When your not on vacation its just like normal sims so im not pleased with sims vaction BUT on the other hand sims online and sims unleashed are awesome!!I wouldnt recomend sims vacation but sims unleashed and online go for it!!
2,"Okay, not as great as the other patches. could live witout",It is okay but it is not a good as the other patches. I was really disappointed and was hoping for more.
2,exciting at first,"ok so I bought this game thinking it would be really cool. After playing a few times it got boring. Now I just wanna get rid of it! I'm sorry I paid ...[price]... for it. I got ""the Sims Unleashed"", that's better and actually fun even after a while. Unlike the ""vacation"" expansion pack."
4,Me like Sims. Sims fun. Sims good.,"Sims vacation is O.K. It could be I was expecting a lot more from it. I personally think it could have been better... but I still love the sims anyway so,whoever doesn't have Sims Vacation is a loser and should be flogged in our center square. Oh yeah, If Will Wright sees this I want to say you are a genius. I am not worthy. Peace out."
5,I love this game (the sims),"A new ad-on?The Sims vacantion,is a game i ever wayet is that the sims go in vacantion.My mother play all the time The Sims(all 4 ad-on)and she always tell me he want a Sims Vacantion,you know take sims out,in vacantion ,not like Hot Date..."
2,My true opinion,"I see that a lot of other people have left reviews that tell of the features of the game, not what they actually think. This is an ok expansion pack, but really doesn't add anything particularly special to the game. Sure you can go on vacation, but there isn't that much to do while on vacation, I think it gets rather boring. You can even bring a friend on vacation, but can't control them so the friend just gets cranky.If you are choosing between this and another expansion pack, don't pick this one!! I chose it over hotdate and wish I hadn't bothered to get it at all! WASTE OF MONEY!!"
3,Not the best,"The Sims Vacation is fun, it has a some new objects, a couple of new skins, and lots of new interactions with sim children. But the game gets old after a while. The only reason I would reccomend buying it is for better socal interactions with children. If you are getting an expansion pack I would check out Hot Date."
1,Doesn't Work with Windows XP,"I was looking forward to Vacation, only to get it home today, and I can't get it to run, it may run for a little while but then it just dumps me to the desktop. I looked around at some Forums at TheSims.com and well known fan sites, only to find that a lot of people are having problems running the game, especially with XP.So to sum up, this was a complete waste of money since I can't even play the game."
4,Very fun!!,I see this game as very enjoyable. Every Maxis EP (expantion pack) is great! you should buy every one!!
2,Not the must-have I expected...,"I am a total Sim-addict, and never seem to get enough of playing The Sims with all of the other expansion packs. However, this one leaves me disappointed. Perhaps I am just too accustomed to ""the comforts of sim-home"", and the vacation island does not fulfill my sim's needs all that well. It only took playing it twice to master it and get the special vacation award, which my sims didn't even seem to care about anyway! It takes up an awful lot of additional computer memory, and really taxes my video card's abilities as well; and frankly just isn't worth the trade off....as opposed to all the other expansion packs, which I would sacrifice even my Word program to play, thank goodness I don't need to! For a gamer that can afford to do so, get a mega computer with 512 RAM memory and sim all you want... or get a second computer, and dedicate it for your Sims!"
5,JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT WAS OVER!!!,this game's title says it all felling down wanna delete your family cuz there modds are gettin lowe JUST CALL A CAB AND WWAKE UP TO PARADICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ITS WORTH THE 10.00 AND HAS ABSOLULELY NO BUGS!!!!!!!!BUY THE GAME AND DONT REGRET IT!!!!
4,Very satisfied,"This is the third one of these Black and Decker blower vacs I have owned. I had one stolen so now I have one for my front and back yards. I have to say that I am very pleased with this product. It is amazing to me how many different types of things it will vacuum up in the yard. I wish that the bag had a bit more capacity, but then the bag can get heavy if it was too much larger. It has always worked well and the mulching of the yard waste is great for composting or if you have to throw the waste away. For the price it is a great bargain."
1,Blown 2 motors already,"I'll start positive...I loved the features and power of this blower. So far each unit I've had was great for about 2 months of heavy leaf season......then flames, smoke, and boom -- dead motor. Twice. Since the fan/vac is just hard plastic, if you suck up a small piece of mulch or too many sweet gum balls it just can't handle it. And if you're like me, you think there's a way to avoid it, but it's just too difficult. There's just no way to keep those things out of your leaf piles.I wonder what I should get now... I'm hooked on the leaf/mulcher concept... if only they'd last more than a season!"
5,So easy to use,"I like how easy it is to use,just plug it in and your off. There seems to be a lot of power,and being a smaller women,I don't have any problem with it. If I could just use it in the house!"
1,Black & decker leaf hog BV2500 type5,This thing sucks big time only 2 uses and the thing stopped working. After opening it up I found that 1 of the motor brushes disintegrated and B&D don't sell those separately from the motor. I guess if you need a disposable leaf blower get a Black & Decker one. What a crappy product! NEVER AGAIN 2 uses for $100. If I can give them less that one star I would but that's not an available option. Stay clear from that product and save your money.
3,"It was okay, but with a lot of problems","When I bought this, I bought it because my neighbor had a blower vac, which got hard to rake leaves up. I liked that it ate up leaves and got hard to rake leaves out of bushes. It's attachments where easy to put on and take off. Recently we had a major problem, it wouldn't turn off!! It wouldn't turn off unless you unplugged it. Also the propeller wore away after a month. Quite dusty too."
1,Forget This One,"Well, the thing worked OK for one season, and then the motor started to wheeze and shreik, the smell of burning wire permeated the air, and the Leaf Hog went to Hog Heaven. Look elsewhere and save yourself some money!"
1,Good Mulcher...OK Blower....Burns out after two years,Only used 6 times and motor started to burn out. I don't recommend buying based on the number of reviews that has similiar problems. B&D should recall these items.
2,Zipper on bag is useless,"This is a great product, except that the zipper on the bag continually breaks. I am on my third bag in a single year. If they just made the zipper better, this product would rock. Until they do, I would never recommend this to anyone."
1,Black & Decker does it again!,"Whilst at a construction trade show I overheard two B & D reps talking. One said ""the construction grade tools are well designed, but the consumer drills, for example are designed for a twelve hour life"". This is not unrealistic for a weekend warrior who might use the drill once or twice a year, drilling the occasional holes.The Leaf Hog is apparently in the same category, based on sterling initial reviews, I put my doubts aside and bought one. With about 35 hours of use, it has quit.Buyer beware!"
4,Blower/Vacuum review,"It seems to do what is advertised. As a blower, it works very good. In dry California, the vacuum raises a lot of dust, but that's to be expected."
2,Magnolia leaves - forget it.,"For sucking up and mulching regular leaves (mulberry, maple, liquidamber) it works great. For Magnolia leaves forget it. You'll get about a season out of it, less if your tree is large. The impeller is plastic and the leathery leaves just eat it up. I've burned 3 of these up on magnolia leaves. They plug the intake quite easily and the load burns up the motor."
4,4+ stars actually,My Yard: .25 acres when the leaves are down you cannot see the grass. small twigs and acorns and some pine cones.I bought the orginal B&D; design in 1997. I was looking for a blower but for $20 more I got the vacum combo to try. It worked ok and really saves the back but jammed quite a bitI bought the new one this year because of design changes. Now for the price performance I highly recommend it. It clogged maybe 4 times in 5 hours use today.You need to buy the garbage can hose extension to make practical use of the vac. The bag it comes with is too small. Put a 50 gallon plastic bag in a trash can on wheels and put on the B&D; attachment from the garbage can to the lawn vac. This combination gives excellent price performance.
1,"Great at first, then motor failed","It worked great as a blower, but after 1 season, the motor end bearing disintegrated allowing the shaft and commutator to jump around. This caused the motor brushes to spark excessivily causing massive wear and overheating (the ozone smell that others have reported).Clearly a major design flaw in the motor."
2,Classic LARE Study Material,"I found vignettes #2 and #3 severely out of scale. Vignettes #1 and #9 are slightly out of scale. I am disappointed that our profession cant get it together with the study material for the LARE. With that said, I would buy this book used or split it with a study partner becuase its not worth the full price."
4,For The Cookie Lover Who Also Has An Artist's Flair,"The pictures and instructions shown in DECORATING COOKIES are enticing enough to call me to the kitchen and try a hand at turning my ordinary cookies into the extraordinary. Probably not a book for those who have time restraints. The cookies in this book are somewhat labor-intensive, but they are truly a labor of love."
3,product probably works but did not fit,"recieved frost plug but didnt install for a couple weeks, ordered based on amazons fit guide but did not fit my vehicle as indicated, was 2 days late on the 30 day return policy so am stuck."
1,White 7 foot CAT5E Ethernet Cable,These cables are horrible. The connectors are so bad that it is extremely difficult to disconnect them.
4,Useful,"This is not a bad book. Useful in a lot of situations in which setting the point and shoot on AUTO won't work for you. In other words, this is not a book aimed at the DSLR photographer, but I was surprised to find that there was a good deal of useful ideas in it for special situations. For those who are relatively new to the prosumer or point and shoot world, it's a VERY useful book."
3,Tries to do too much and offers too little,"I'm a pro photographer looking for good books to recommend to beginning and intermediate photographers. So caveat on this review - I just skimmed it. But it was readily clear to me it tries to do too much and provides too little info. I'll keep looking for the ultimate beginner to intermediate Bible to see if there is something out there other than the Upton book from my art school days. This book is long on pictures, short on text, and it just covers so many diverse topics that one is left not having enough depth to know any single one. Or worse yet, the reader thinks they know a topic covered in this book by reading it, when there is so much more to learn. I won't be recommending the book - not because it's really a horrible book (it's not), it's just I believe there are better ways to help the target market for this book."
4,America's Perspective on the War.,"This DVD has some great footage on it from World War II. This is a collection of United News newsreels that would have appeared before a movie at the theater. Could you imagine going to watch Iron Man at the theater (summer of 2008!!!) and seeing news instead of a preview for the next Will Ferrell film!!!The first section was great with the movement of Germany through Europe. There are real images of tanks, planes and battleships. With lines like 'There is no place in a civilized world for Germany' though you know it is the American perspective of the war."
5,Excellent compilation of songs and footage,"I am not a particularly big Eric Clapton fan. But a person would have to be crazy to pass up this great assembly of Clapton at his absolute best. Plus it contains footage from his early days with the Yardbirds, Cream, and various solo concerts. I want to mention that I didn't get the DVD to work correctly until I ordered it from Amazon, I bought two copies previously from Media Play and they constantly skipped. ??? Anyone else? Either way, Amazon's copy worked fine. Bad batch I guess.SONGS INCLUDED: Louise/ Crossroads/ I Feel Free/ Sunshine of Your Love/ Strange Brew/ White Room/ Badge/ Worried Life Blues/ Layla/ Knockin' On Heaven's Door/ Cocaine/ I Shot the Sheriff/ Wonderful Tonight/ Forever Man/ Tearing Us Apart/ Behind the Mask/ Holy Mother"
3,Cute for the younger set,"This book has a cute story and, more importantly, a Matchbox snowplow toy. The story age level is about age 3. The toy age level is whatever age likes to play with Matchbox cars."
2,Dont bother stick to the TV Show,"I tried to play this game with friends after a dinner party. We all (except one man)love the TV show but found this board game slow and difficult to make work properly. The voting gets complicated and everyone wanted to play - not ask questions.We found it lacked the ""drama"". The money is not real so it does not really matter. My friend who brought it round to play was really disappointed.We plan to stick to the TV show - Go Regis!"
3,TDK DVD+R,I thought this brand would provide better quality than Memorex's because it's more expensive but sadly this is not the case. I burned five discs and two failed. I'll go back to Memorex - similar failure rate but it's cheaper.
5,Nice!,"While I have to admit I have not sat down and watched this entire video with my kids (I'm actually not sure I've watched THIS one at all), I've seen and heard enough to know it's a great video. They seem to like it pretty well (boys ages almost 7 and almost 9) and it teaches a great lesson. I love any video that entertains my kids while teaching them Biblical principles :)."
1,"IT WAS GREAT, WHEN IT WORKED THAT IS","Decided to do my own lawn work so I bought this , an electric mower and other stuff, it wasn't too hard to set up,the first time I used it, it was great, the next time I used it, it started off well then I smelt burning,smoke came out of the casing and I decided I'd better quit before it exploded or something. I called amazon and they promised a refund. I heard B&D were good, so I am hoping this is just a one-off. I wish the instructions were clearer too, like what do you do with the lengthening spool, trim it off ? leave it?"
3,Works as advertised,"I've had this item for about a month. My only real complaint is that the shroud that fits above the string and protects you from getting hit is easily dislodged. Other than that it is light, easy to use and does the job."
3,#%*^^#$!,"This is a light weight weed whacker that works pretty well, until you have to mess with the spool. It is just too difficult to replace the spool due to a design flaw (the string itself gets in the way of the spool). It does get bogged down when the weed is dense, but the positive is that it gets very close to the spot you want to whack."
3,Okay at first...,"It took about 1.5 weeks to get but when I got it i was pretty pleased. But after using it everyday for two weeks the adjustable blocks started to hold less.Out of the box the blocks would not really hold to the track (I dont know if its because of the track ive been using) (I just used a hurdle to hold it in its place; no biggy for me)Its an ok ""begginers"" block."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE!,"This is probably the worst tax software I have every purchased. I've been using TurboTax and TaxCut for years and this year I have had nothing but problems from the state program and the Federal.For one, there are ""fixes"" that won't download. Everytime I do, the program crashes during installation.I am hoping that I get a refund from Amazon for the $89 I spent on the TaxCut Complete for Home & Business (same problem by the way) and the 24.50 I spent on the state program.I'm always going to purchase TurboTax from now on because the technical support at for this product blows. All they did was tell me the same stupid thing over and over again (in other words, they had no idea what to do!) ($9.95 for calls to get tech support, isn't that nice?)"
3,what the heck 13 discs!,"I am a big Duran Duran fan. I have every album made from the 80s. I made the mistake of buying this before I carefully looked at the contents.Now the music is great and it has songs not found anywhere else. I really liked the Re-mix versions of songs such as Save a prayer and Union of the snake.But what I hated about this was this thing has 13 discs thats right 13 discs, why? All these songs could have easily fit on 3 discs or 4 tops. This thing is bulky and expensive. I imagine if they would have fit this in to less discs it could have been half the price.I ended up having to create my own mix cds.I really want to buy the other box set 1986 - 1995 but I am afraid I will hate the form of that box set also."
5,At Last,"I remember rushing down to the music store the day the single was released (and it had to be the 12"" not the 7""). I would marvel for hours at the way Duran Duran could extend a song. Not just a longer song, but a new and sometimes more complete one.This is a MUST have for the D2 Fan. We have waited 15 years for this collection. It was worth it, but I hope they don't make us wait that long for the 86-03 collection."
1,not recommended,please dont buy or listen to this collection of horrible cd's i wont recommend this to mature people with good tastes in music.no stars
1,VP450 Sprayer,Works find on level ground. If ground isn't level unit will turn over. Wheel base needs to be wider to correct problem.
5,best thing since the dvd player,"this is a great gadget for the person that likes electronics. works great and easy to use, it will make adding the chemicals the hardest thing about spraying. this goes along with ideal of putting a 2 litter bottle with the bottom cut out on the end of the sprayer to control your weed killer in the flower beds, no over spray."
3,Take with a grain of salt,"A good book but not as complete as Yes, You can still Retire Comfortably.Does not fully elaborate on the risks of bonds in dealing with Financials (sub-prime) and Bond defaults. Perhaps an update of this book is in order."
3,Interesting little video sampler from Zappa's video catalog,"This is another one of those Zappa movies that has been out of print for years. The video is sort of a compilation of selections from Zappa's other movies (which are also out of print). In addition to that, Frank also gives a few exclusives including some concert footage, the ""You Are What You Is"" video, and Frank's court testimony against a Maryland censorship bill. Frank's commentary throughout the tape is funny too. Worth checking out if you can find it."
2,does not fit my 60D 18-135 lens,Good quality but this lens hood does not fit my 18-135mm.End up I have to return this unit. No problem in returning.
2,Not for the beginner,"This book is for wood carvers and not for the neophyte wondering how to best sharpen a kitchen knife or a lawn mower blade. Lots of information and photographs, but it's hard to figure out what motion is going on from the still photography.In the first hour of looking through the content, I found several typo's and even more ""wordo's"". e.g. Page 70 - ""Some Japanese stones have only one bevel."" I don't think that ""stones"" have bevels - guess they meant ""knives"". Stilted language could be replaced by some simple advice. How about some straight-forward step-by-step instructions for sharpening a knife?"
1,We know the obvious,"I am a college student, taking an intro to Office 97 with this book. If you need an introduction to computers - this isn't the book. Just because you're not a ""techie"" doesn't mean you have the I/Q of a lab rat- but that's what this book assumes. He reiterates the same concepts thoroughout the whole book, recycling them until you're consumed with boredom.To conclude: I'm sure it will not take a thousand page book for you to learn how to save a document, my friends."
2,Fan,I liked 7m3 for a long time. American standard was really good. Now they come out with stuff that sounds like crap. I just don't understand why the would come out with such good stuff then come out with stuff that doesnt even sound like them. I am just very dissapointed. I just hope the next album they come out with is better.
3,Decent effort -- but not as innovative as earlier work,"I have been a big fan of the band since American Standard. Back then, the band grabbed my attention with its ability to mix hard-driving, raucous tunes like ""My My"" with melodic and unique songs like ""Rodrigo"" and ""Punch In and Out"". In addition, Jason Ross' ability to transform his wonderfully raspy vocals into a melodic tones caught me off guard as well.The follow up album, Rock Crown, highlighted the band's diverse talent to an even greater extent. From beginning to end, it walks a delicate balance between strightforward rock n' roll and addictive, innovative pop-inspired riffs that make it one of the most prized CDs in my collection.While The Economy of Sound contains hints (""Wait"" and ""First Time Believers"" are good examples) of what made me a big fan of the first two records, it just doesn't have the same impact. Still, it is a good record. If you like this, I urge you to give one of the first two a listen--I bet you won't be disappointed."
1,"""Good Theif"" is a Bad Movie","This is a movie that I would never want to see a second time--it was bad enough the first time. The plot was difficult to follow and Nolte is a mess even when he is supposed to be ""cleaned up."" The acting was strained and mostly unbelieveable. Don't waste your money. The movie is a bad ""B"" version of Ocean's Eleven, but without any interesting characters."
3,"Good performance, but poor sound quality","This could have been a better DVD, after being remastered, if only the quality of the sound was better. It is in stereo, and unless you can set your equalizer up to compensate for the poor sound, you will not enjoy it as much as some of the others released in Dolby digital 5.1."
2,Disappointing,"Faure's songs are exquisite. Unfortunately, this album does not show them in the best light. Three of the five singers - Felicity Lott, Stephen Varcoe and Jennifer Smith - are closer to sixty than fifty, and they sound it. Geraldine McGreevy and Jean-Paul Fouchecourt provide a mere nine (out of 28) tracks of compensation, but nearly 24 minutes of Jennifer Smith wavering through La chanson d'Eve is almost too much.Buy this if you have the other three, just to complete the set."
4,Leap of Faith Rocks!,Leap of faith rocks even though there is not that many matches on it. The Hardy boyz r sooooooooooooooooo cool. i think they should have a best of matt hardy dvd. i already am getting the best of jeff hardy dvd.
2,JUST FOR FUN,"I doubt if too many people laid awake at night in fear after watching this movie. The special effects really sucked, but the movie was good.(GOOD, NOT REALLY GOOD OR GREAT). There could have been abit more romance betwen the two main characters. Also one of the two should have been in greater jeopardy at the end. This threat mixed with romance would have made the movie better. I would actually give the movie a 2.75 score. The two dimwits got on my nerves. One of the many comical moments was the prfessor turning around in digust and telling them to shut up. It would not have taken much to have made this a better movie, but apparently someone ran out of money.This is a movie that should be viewed just for fun. In that vane, it is well worth the ten bucks for the dvd. I say do it over again. Only this time, get a loan."
4,Thomas Kinkade: Treasury of Christmas,"Thomas Kinkade: Treasury of ChristmasThis is a collection of Christmas music performed by the 101 Strings Orchestra. There are three CD's and each CD has a theme. The first CD is titled ""Victorian Christmas I,"" the second ""A Holiday Gathering,"" and the third ""Home for the Holidays.""These CD's have all traditional Christmas music we've been hearing for years, but now they are preformed in an orchestral setting, making the songs sound grander and more complete. They are pleasant to listen to and are great for back ground music for getting into the holiday mood.The three CD's come in a tin box with a plastic and paper fold out holder for easy access and under each CD is a list of music contained on the CD. There is also a comprehensive listing on the back of the tin and the CD holder. The CD's are well-recorded and with 24 bit sound, sound well when played on a Blu-ray player.I enjoyed listening to this music and I hope you will as well."
2,Same old Public Domain stuff already restored on SONY DVDs !,"This is the same old four public domain titles that pop up everwhere.They also appear on the SONY Three Stooges DVDs, restored form 35mm.If you want cheap, you'll get what you pay for here. If you want quality buy the SONY DVDs."
2,Characterizations Disappointing,"Although Mr. West is a competent enough writer of the western genre, his characterizations of Dodge's citizens leave something to be desired. In particular, the character of Miss Kitty was almost unrecognizable. I doubt that Mr. West ever watched the later years of ""Gunsmoke"" or else he would have written Kitty as a more mature, fully developed character. The Kitty in this novel is too soft and girlish--as if a 21 year old Kitty exists in the last years of the show. Where's the tough-as-nails Kitty I know? Yes, the relationship between Matt and Kitty was implied, particulary in later years, and it was definitely implied as a sexual as well as emotional relationship. The relationship between Matt and Kitty in West's book is overly sentimental and lacking sexual chemistry. As grateful as I am that someone is still writing ""Gunsmoke"" stories, I wish they would get the character of Kitty right."
3,A few good ideas but not for beginners,"Not much better or worst than other day trading books. The ""Day trading method"" could have been expanded and the appendix section reduced. If you don't already have an understanding of technical analysis, you'll wish you did. However the chart examples and explanations are so few that you really aren't missing much."
2,WHERE'S THE BEEF,"Pages 3-50 of this book is dealing with some what useful information, for the novice invester. Pages 51-70 testimonials from professianal Traders is exciting and interesting. I found from pages 80-175 useful and worth my reading, I must mention that half those pages had charts. Pages 177-196 names and stock symbols, again probley for the novice. Pages 197-256 Appendix B Excerpts from the TradeCast 3.0 user manual, why I would want this unless I was going to buy the program and my hope would be that the manual would cover this, and then again maybe this book is the manual for the program and they just forgot to send the program?. Pages 257-267 Glossary, Further Reading, and the Index.Summary-For $40.00 and 269 pages, I found 90 pages (half of those charts) dealing with the Authors title(Moving from One Winning Position to the Next) or as a very famous advertisment slogan goes..... WHERE'S THE BEEF"
5,t,This is a great album. Great musicians throughout. A nice mix of blues and classic rock. One of his best in my opinion.
1,Pure Waste of Money,"Absolute junk. AFS system does not work. I have to manually refeed the line. I have not had the patience to complete edging my yard during the course of a single day because I spend greater than 50% time popping off the spool cap and manually refeeding the line. It takes about an hour to edge 150 feet, because the line breaks and needs to be manually refed every 1 to 3 minutes. Please don't buy this."
4,Quiet and Convenient,"I bought this trimmer because I wanted a quieter alternative to a gas engine. It is well balanced, especially with the angle adjustable handle. I use this primarily for trimming grass along my backyard fence and it does a reasonably good job and no battery rundown problems. As mentioned in other reviews, the auto-feed is balky. As you trim, it begins to ""fade."" Then suddenly it's back to full trimming. Once you get used to it, it's a tolerable trade-off. The wall-mount storage holder/charger is great. The charger has lights to indicate charging status."
3,Pretty good trimmer,I know that cordless trimmers have to have some compromises. If they make it as powerful as a gas model or run all day it would be too heavy to carry. If they make it small and light than it won't have enough power or capacity to do the job. This trimmer has adequate power (barely) and allows you to trim and edge a small yard without being too heavy to carry.Like other reviewers I find the automatic line feed to be balky. To be fair I also had problems with other trimmers with this feature so I don't think any of them are perfect. At first I had trouble with the edging feature but once I got the hang of it I can do almost as good a job edging with this trimmer as I used to do with my dedicated edger.This is a good unit as long as you are willing to put up with the compromises necessary to make it cordless and electric. If you need a lot of power or need to do a large lot it is no replacement for a gas trimmer.
4,Perfect for 2 years,"I got my cordless Grass Hog three years ago. The first two summers were great, not having to deal with messy gasoline or electric cords. Unfortunately, when I got the unit out this spring, the battery would not charge up properly. While at first I could do my entire yard and fenceline on one charge, now I can only go about 50 feet. I am still considering buying another one, however, because it did work pretty well for awhile."
2,Didn't make it through the summer,"I was initially very pleased with this edger/trimmer combo. My gasoline powered trimmer was a bit too heavy for me, and I HATE rolling up extention cords for electric trimmers.The grass hog worked just as well as any other trimmer I've used...while it worked. After a few months, it got stuck in edger mode and won't twist back. Did I save the receipt? Of course not. So it looks like I'll be dragging out the extention cords again."
3,its ok,"this is the first trimmer/edger i've actually owned, usually just borrowed one.good points: easy to put together (instructions still in plastic bag). easy transition from trimmer to edger. cordless freedom is great ,sure beats messing around with gas or tangled extention cords.bad points: battery life is not that great, when weak it looks like its just playing with the grass. wish it had two strings instead of one. plastic parts could be better quality, although i havn't any problems yet."
4,It was nearly the same at Slane Castle,"I bought these two DVDs: ""Live at The Budokan"" & ""Live at Slane Castle"". Only three people on stage: Bryan, a guitar player and the drumer. I think that's enough to play good rock music, as they did. Track lists are the same for those concerts, so that's not a difference.The main difference is the attendance. I think it would be wondeful to be at Slane Castle. Robbie Williams also performed a concert there, another success. However, it's not the same in Japan. They are enthusiastic, the scream loudly but that's not enough to reach Ireland's atmosphere.Another thing: when Bryan wanna sing ""When You're Gone"", a girl climbs to the stage and try to sing the song... I'd like to forget that...I give 3.5 stars to this DVD, for Bryan's music."
4,Fun to watch,"Very enjoyable. We had fun watching it. Would recommend it. Liked the songs that he played, had some fun stuff in it. Not much else to say."
5,Creating a better world,"I am reading ""Treating the Explosive Child"" and simply cannot put this book down - if everyone incorporated this approach into everyday life, what a humane world it could be. Thank you, Dr Ablon and Green for the expertise you are sharing and disseminating to the world - in my eyes, you are true heroes."
2,Childish writing style,"I chose to stop reading this book in the middle of the first chapter. The author's writing style was very child-like. Even if there is a good story here, the author's presentation of it turned me off. Very unsophisticated prose and dialogue.Sorry, I tried to love it since he is from my hometown. I wish him well on his newest book. I'll try it also."
4,"""Never knew what I was missing...""","As every rock fan worth his or her salt knows, Eric Clapton was in his prime during the 1960's. Be it with the Yardbirds, Bluesbreakers, Cream or Blind Faith, it seemed like El Clapitan couldn't fail. And in this case, working with Mayall for an all-too-short one album colaboration, he didn't. And though there are some lesser throwaways (those instrumentals near the end, with the exception of Steppin' Out, qualify there), this disc is packed with brilliant material. Be it All Your Love, Hideaway, Double Crossing Time, What I Say, Parchman Farm, Ramblin' on My Mind or Steppin' Out, Bluesbreakers with Clapton never fails to deliver. And though it isn't the most creative album ever made, if you're into the blues (and what Clapton fan isn't?), you should take a look at this."
4,Classic early Eric Clapton,"I stumbled onto this one when reviewing a Yardbirds CD. This was the group that Eric Clapton was with (although very shortly) after leaving the Yardbirds and before forming Cream. His guitar work makes this album/CD worth listening to. Some really great stuff, very bluesy. No hit singles on this record but probably a must for Eric Clapton fans. A great classic album, a best kept secret."
4,If you like Clapton...,This is a great album for anyone who is a fan of Clapton or blues guitar music. A nice arrangement for 1966. A true test of time.
3,Violin Sonata,"It's worth having this CD for those interested in violin sonatas. It's one of his better works, and well played. This CD would be more well rounded-out by including his Poem in c# minor for solo piano -- one of his very best pieces which should be available on CD but apparently is not."
2,"Nice title, not much content","Not what I was hoping to find. I'm not a writer, but I was interested in how to keep going continuously in a creative profession. Not covered. The content might be a valuable lesson to the most airheaded members coming into the biz, but ""good for losers"" is not a quality.Nice title."
5,Brilliant learning tool!,"I hold a Ph.D. in sociology with a strong computer/theoretical background in statistics and yet never really got much into matrix algebra. This video changed all of that! Fantastic job, Jason. Way to go, easy to understand and he cuts through all of the nonsense."
2,Really should be titled 1999 Caribbean Cruises,"Though Frommer's reviewed the ports of call in top notch Frommer's style they greatly lack in up to date ship information. In particular, little information on Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the Seas- which is the reason I purchased it. I emailed the author concerning this and received no response."
5,DEMO QUALITY,"CRISP VIDEO,BEAUTIFULLY DEFINED AUDIO W/TIGHT,CLEAN BASS.THIS IS A MUST-HAVE FOR ANY HOME THEATER.STRONG PERFORMANCE AND SONG SELECTION WILL APPEAL TO NON-GENRE FANS.ONE OF THE FEW CONCERT DISCS YOU WILL WATCH IN ITS ENTIRITY"
5,Truly First Class,"Video and audio quality is exceptional. LOVE the songs and sequence, as well as the between-song comments by Alison and the others. A real first class group and concert. Have watched it three times in the first week, recommended it to everyone, have loaned it out, and am here to send another as a gift. The interviews and extras on the second disc are also great. This is my New Favorite DVD. :-)"
4,"Great Group & what a voice Alison has, huh?","This is a GREAT DVD performance by Alison Krauss & Union Station. The sound is very good, and the stage location makes you feel like you're right there with them. Great close-ups and views throughout the concert!The ONLY thing I don't like about this DVD is that it's in ""Wide Screen"" format. I personally prefer Full Screen on all movies....Even if you only like Alison's singing a little, you'll love this concert DVD!4 Stars only because of the Wide Screen format. 5 Stars for the performance itself...."
5,Wonderful,I don't think I could say anything better than what everyone else already has. They could sing T.V. commercials or Nursery Rhymes and I'd still listen. They are amazing.
4,BOOK DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY PASSENGER LISTS!!,"I had been searching for this book ever since I read its poorly-written review because I thought it contained the passengers' surnames for each voyage. It arrived this morning, and I eagerly opened the book only to discover that there were NO passenger lists. Be advised that it is the National Archives that houses the lists, NOT this book, which is merely an aid to using the Archives.I suspect that the book is so difficult to locate because everyone thinks it has the passenger lists.The book does have some useful information, but it probably will not be what you're expecting. - Karen....disappointed"
5,Love it,"Ethan and Grace are perfect for eachother, but It got really irritating how he thought Grace was 'delicate' and 'fragile' expecially after she is raising a daughter alone and working such hard jobs. She stood up to him and that was cool. They really flow together."
3,i got what i wanted when i wanted it,I thought the earrings were beautiful and I got exactly what was specified. It came in a timely manner and I would shop with this company again in a heart beat.
3,JERRY'S LOVE LETTER TO DEAN!,"I grew up in the 60's and remember practically all the notable events of Martin and Lewis. Their appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show was my first taste of their act. Sorry, but they werent for me. And later on when their romance ended, I liked Dean better.I am not a fan of Jerry Lewis altho I appreciate his work for Muscular Dystrophy. He'd be lost without it. But I do appreciate his unrequited love for Dean Martin.These were two men were enigmas to each other and yet clicked. I remember Dean Martin's son's fatal plane crash. Dino was married to Dorothy Hamill at the time. She was a favorite and a star in her own right.Life changes; life goes on. This is a quick read. Lots of facts become clear that were kept from the public at the time. Poor Jerry. Sometimes it's harder on the survivor."
2,sad,"I have always enjoyed the Martin/Lewis films. They were well made, funny and great entertainment for the family. If there had been a rating system back then, they would always have been rated 'G'. I'm sad to say, his book would probably have been rated 'R'. It's sad how entertainers can be successful and make a lot of money, and suddenly morality goes out the window."
4,Funny!,"I bought this video for my daughter for Christmas last year. We have always liked SNL, especially the older 80's shows. She loves it! Just wish they would do more of the ""cheerleader"" skits!"
5,Starrett 98-8 8-Inch Precision Machinists Level,"This is a fine piece of equipment. Very well made, solid, carefully machined. A good level is one of the few precision measuring devices that is self- calibrating. It did not arrive calibrated but ten minutes of tinkering put things right and it has been perfectly adequate to the task of leveling the beds and ways of a whole shop full of mills and other precision cutting machinery. You can spend a lot more without getting appreciably better results. The photos are a little misleading in that there is only one level in the box. The instrument has two glasses( a ""major"" and a ""minor"") set at 90 degrees in the same plane, both on the same frame. The ""major"" glass is the only one that is truly accurate. The ""minor"" glass just lets you know if you are in the ballpark with respect to the second axis of the plane you are concerned about.Starrett 98-8 8-Inch Precision Machinists Level"
2,we've all got problems,"the message of this book seems to be that transsexual people are more than just transsexuals. they are people. yes, thank you mr. rees. thank you for beating that message into me for 184 pages. seemingly without direction, he pounds out the events of his life, giving the reader the name of every friend along the way. oh, and thanking each of them, again and again. a look into a life with conflict, but we all have problems. read it if you somehow think homosexuals are the same thing as transexuals, but by and large an un-enlightening book."
2,"great premise, but......","I randomly picked this book up in a bookstore. The back sounded interesting (then again they all do) but I was disappointed by the story's execution. He saves all of his revelations for the last 3 pages, (not nearly enough) and the rest of the book is confusing and boring. There is no character development, and what is going on with the secondary characters is never fully explained. It's too bad, especially as he had a great initial premise. If you want good apolyptic writing try The Handmaids Tale by Margaret Atwood (feminist) or Good Omens by Terry something and Neil something (humor). Horror seems like the right genre for apolyptic stories, but so far I haven't found any authors that I like or any books that competently dealt with it."
1,over rated guide,"This guide is more of the same. Basically tells you about the colleges you already know have good reputations-- ivys, and the ones just below them. Not helpful for kids who want to follow a non-liberal arts path. Not an in depth book, more just a glossary of colleges and universities. Big disappointment"
3,Fiske Name attached,Good Purchase? - Would be a Great Purchase if More Majors were included. Sort of a back and forth college match up of information. I am not certain if I would have purchased this book - knowing what I know.It does have the Fiske bits of helpful information!
2,Blue is the word!,"My darling 75 year old neighbor gave me this trilogy. (She is my source for most of my 'hot' reads):DBad Jack Callahan and sweet Dani Dupree get together after 13 years of separation. They were hot as teenagers and it didnt stop there. Formulaic in that there was a secret child and that they go at it hot and heavier than before. So much so that I found myself skimming over some of the episodes. (I cant believe I just typed that!!!!).The ending was sweet but I have diffiuclty in how Matt received the news about Holly which was skimmed over like a night pass from Batman.Well, its fiction and my neighbor loved it. Now I have to read the next two so I will be invited back for her oatmeal raisen cookies again!!!!! TBC"
5,"Haven't seen it, but it will be great.","Everybody needs to hear ALL of the Lips albums, not just the last two. ""Transmissions..."" may be one of the most beautiful albums of all time."
5,A simply amazing read,My mother was 10 years old when the Russians came into Berlin. She had told me stories of family friends she knew of who were raped repeatedly by the plundering Russians. Many ended their own life after.This book really was an eye opener. Dread enters your stomach as you're reading the book especially before the approaching days of the Russians. Her power of observation of everything around her is gripping. A simply amazing read.
5,A Woman in Berlin,A most interesting book about life in Berlin during the Russian occupation. Quite disturbing events described. Should be read by all who are troubled by man's inhumanity to man.
4,Retelling of D.H. Lawrence's THE FOX.,"British goremeister Norman J. Warren's THE PREY is actually a retelling of D.H. Lawrence's classic novelle, THE FOX.Lawrence's THE FOX is about a young man who intrudes upon a lesbian couple's cozy world, creating a tense love triangle. There's also an actual fox, a metaphor for the man's entry into their world.THE PREY has it all, including the fox. Only, in THE PREY, the young man happens to be an alien who occassionally kills (turns out he likes the taste of human flesh).At the end, the film diverges from the book. Still, it's interesting seeing an old literary classic recast into a sci-fi gorefest."
5,A video? From Herb? It's about time!,"I was just cruising around Amazon and found out that ol' Herb finally put out a DVD and in concert to boot. Well, I have been waiting for some time to see herb in action. I haven't seen him in action since he performed with the TJB in 1984 promoting their Bullish album on the Grammy's. I know this is a pre review, but what can I say? I will get this DVD and love it! I certainly hope he puts out more videos. LONG OVERDUE, HERB!"
5,adidas = great product,"Had this snickers for a month now. Rubberized toe is really easy to clean, while I am quite messy. Very comfortable"
4,Terrible quality but I like it anyway,"Super cheap construction - looks almost unfinished inside and they sewed the front pocket all wonky (one corner way higher up than the other and a hole from where the machine missed the seam) but I really like it anyway - it's the perfect size for me; carries a bulky wallet and three other zippered sacs as well as a crossword book, my iphone and sundry other small items. It hangs comfortably cross-body and seems to weigh less then my other bag with the same stuff in it. It's so cheaply made that I don't think it will last very long but so inexpensive that I'm ordering another one to replace it when it finally does fall apart (which it will - soon, probably)."
4,Canvas Messenger Bag,"This item is geared towards woman, however we found a different use for it. It was originally ordered for my son to use as part of his Indiana Jones Halloween Costume, which was a perfect accent to the whole look and handy to carry his candy. Now that halloween has passed he has found it helpful to take along with him on his scout outings, it's the perfect size to hold his handbook, note pad, and other supplies, it is also a perfect color match to the official khaki green scout pants too!"
2,Be Real!!,"The Cash-Money has ran out!!lol This CD wuz a big dissapointment. I thought Turk wuz gonna come wit something. Turks lyrics were wasted over these broke like a joke beats! Some tracks were barely aight. The only tracks I really like is....Its In Me, At The Same Time, Freak Da Hoes, Soldierette, All Night, Wanna Be Down. I wouldn't waste my money on it. My cuz did."
4,HOT HOT HOT&HOT,"this is one of the best cashmoney cd ever turk came out raw on this album offtop.my boys the bigtymers came out so,so on dis album but could of came alot better. i think that this ALBUM is going to blow turk up in show biz sceen the album features alot of new comers from cashmoney records b.g. brother hakiem ,lac, stone and 2 newer people christina and mickey christina 2 me sounds preety good.Preety good means preety good,but where is juvinile?Juvinile is not even feat.in any of those songs but the new comers fill in for him good.Best cuts r 17,2,3,6,10,14,18,19,8.There are s lot of dunb skits doe,but overall good"
3,freesia spray,"For those of you who know the wonderful fragrance of Freesia flowers, you will be disappointed by this spray. I have tried many scents and cannot find one to match the flowers in my garden. This spray does not smell much like the flower, however it does have a lovely fragrance."
1,All grown children disappoint by these standards,"A whining feel-good book for baby boomers who want an excuse for laying guilt trips on their grown children. With the exception of a few throw-away comments this book equates ""adultolescents'"" being unmarried or less than wildly successful with criminal activity and drug use. I am 30-something, have an Ivy League PhD and, with my partner, am financially secure. I'm also gay (but in a committed relationship) and unemployed (in a town with a more than 7% unemployment rate). While I am inclined to be grateful for my parents for all that they've done to get me here, Jane Adams encourages them to see the half-empty glass and perceive me as a morally inferior lazy ""boomeranging"" disappointment. I'd be surprised if my parents agree with her!"
1,"When Our Grown Kids Disappoint Us: Letting Go of Their Problems, Loving Them Anyway, and Getting on with Our Lives","Do not waste your money or time reading this book. The title covers what little depth there is between the covers. No solutions other than the obvious. Disappointing...a lot of rambling and not well thought out.If your are looking for direction, meaning and change, try ""Setting Boundaries with Your Adult Children: Six Steps to Hope and Healing for Struggling Parents"" by Allison Bottke and available on Amazon."
1,So now what??,Adams spends a lot of time describing cases but offers very little in solutions. I know now where we are; we just need directions back.
4,If nothing else it proves the struggle is more common than I thought.,"I love my kids. You love your kids. But how many of us are now wondering at what point we screwed up in raising them? Of course we love them, but I wasn't prepared for them rebounding and struggling so hard to be self-sufficient. Tough love was easier before the grandkids came. Now I feel responsible for another generation. I flew the nest at age 18 and never again looked to my parents to rescue me. I just expected that my own children would do the same.This book helped some, but I'm still looking for answers."
5,excellent resource,This book was so helpful that I bought an additional copy for my support group's library. I have also given a copy to a family member.
3,easy read,"I like the author's writing style, however, her assumption that all children graduate high school and then go to college is wrong. I have 3 children, am divorced, and barely get by as a R.N. for 29 years so cannot afford to send anyone to college. One of my sons dropped out of high school and is jobless and not interested in finishing school or doing anything. Those of us who make less than $60,000 per year for a family of four are not sending children to college and so these kids cannot get the education they need for success. I did meet with college recruiters and financial planners, they all laughed in my face and told me white children don't get grant money so my children will work wherever they can or take out college loans that leave them penniless for many years beyond graduation. The author should get off her pedestal and look down at the little people who are below her."
2,Boomer specific,"It was specific to the baby boomer parents. So older parents would not benefit from this book. More often than not, it stated the obvious, rather than giving helpful suggestions."
2,It's not a ghost story.,Don't be mislead by the cover of this book or its synopsis. This book isn't a creepy ghost story. It's a boring romance with a pathetic villan. The characters are flat and unrealistic (not to mention the plot). The best thing about this book was the first chapter. Too bad Blaylock couldn't keep the rest of the story up to that par.
2,Technically Lacking,"The book doesn't deliver on presenting a computer application system for evaluating performance. It takes the CCRC's accredition questions and just expands on them. From the information that was presented I not sure if the authors know what an application system is. In any event the book lacks any hard technical information, or performance standards, that can be used for evaluating and designing a project. It's presentation is more like a general business plan from a recent MBA graduate."
3,The Darker Side of Human Decision Making,"Caught in a seen where a decision must be made to either preserve the family or betray their son, the family faces a moral decision. Telling the decision from their own words and their own perspectives, the novelist explores the darker side of human decision making.Very emotional.The movie does not follow the book. In the movie, the son's murder is an accident. In the book, it's intentional. The producers of the movie thought it might be a better story if the murder was unintentional with the outward appearance of guilt than an actual intentional murder."
3,Passes time for an elderly person,I got this for my father N Law. He played it for a while. I think he enjoyed it and now he has it put away for another time. Arrived very fast. thanks
3,"Now If I could Just Comprehend How to PLay it, I'd be Happy.",I had to rate durability of this item with 5 stars inasmuch as I am an adult who will handle it carefully; if I gave it to my four year old nephew I'm sure he'd make short work of playing with it. After all there are very few durable toys for kids.
1,Just terrible - waste of money,"This is a terrible product - inexpensive, and shows you get what you pay for. The screen is 100x brighter on the advertisement here than it is in actuality. I got this for my father, and he can't see the screen as it's so dark. Game makes noise, but like my dad says, sounds good, but don't know why it's making noise. I have great vision and it's so dark, could not make heads or tails. Waste of money."
1,Don't buy this lampshade,"Don't waste your money. Although this product was very well packaged, the lampshade was dented all around. The damage must have been done before the lampshade was ever boxed. A very high shipping price was not refundable.I rate the product itself (had it not been dented) as cheap-looking."
3,Too much clutter,"Snuffy's simple solo performances on this album are a ""5"", no question ... and if you like booming symphony orchestras and distracting New Age vocalists to accompany guitars, then you'll probably judge the whole album a ""5."" But there are too few of the former, too many of the latter. So please give us another album, Snuffy. Only next time bring fewer friends."
3,Missing Parts,"I was really looking forward to receiving this item. But when I started putting the Monster Truck together, following the directions to the letter, I was missing parts. Now I have half a truck together wondering what I will do to finish it. This is the second Mega Bloks Probuilders I have try to put together and could not finish becuause of missing parts."
5,Way Cool,"When was the last time you picked up a medical textbook and had the reaction ""Hey Way Cool"". That is the reaction you will have to Armstrong and Cohen's practical, beautifully illustrated, readable textbook. This book straddles the media divide betwixt the standard twentieth century text and the future's 21st century media by the way it has been organized. I highly recommend this book to any interested physician."
4,One Glaring Omission,"There are some great songs on this CD, including quite a few songs used in Mitsubishi, Volkswagen, and Gap ads, but one song I would have loved to see included is the song in the current Mitsubishi ad showing lots of different people singing along to it (""Start the Commotion""?). Hopefully that will be included if there is ever an ""As Seen on TV 2."""
2,Product should be described as very small,"product came in good package and was on time as expected. i was disappointed at first for the VeRY small size. the picture of this product should not be close up, but rather, there must be a tool, a hammer at the side or anything to have a good view how big it is. only Nails can fit this and very small tools. And this is in fact what i did to make a good use of it. anyway if you are looking for storage of nails, or sort of, this is for you. but otherwise, avoid."
3,nibbling the hand that feeds,"In his second book ""The End of Patience"" we have David Shenk's self aggrandizing insights into the complex dark canyons of the technological revolution we have been drawn into. Like a prophet from above Shenk has generously mined from his own omni-present commentary on the mélange of ""our"" patronage of all that is technologically new and shinny in order to sound a warning.This warning - in and of itself - might be easier to take seriously were it not itself coming from one whose success is built, and dependent on, the very industry he seeks to protect ""us"" from. However, looking at Shenk through the filter of the book's point of view, it is hard not to agree with the basis of his premises. And we can hardly blame him for only nibbling the hand that feeds him."
3,BEWARE!! NO AC ADAPTOR!,I purchased this item from the Amazon site and it was shipped by JR Music World- This item DOES NOT COME WITH AN AC ADAPTER- as specified on the ad!!! I contacted JandR- they apologized but said its a web error- they did say i could return the item
1,DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE,"OKAY EVERY REVEIW ON THIS PAGE THAT I READ FOR SCHEMIN WAS A BUNCH OF BULL. READING THE REVIEWS FELT LIKE I WAS READING SOMETHING SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THE ANDREA BLACKSTONE PERSONALLY. BE REAL ABOUT THE BOOK. IT WAS THE WORST BOOK...NO PUSH BY SAPPHIRE WAS THE WORST BOOK I READ BUT THIS ONE IS A CLOSE SECOND. I HATED IT. THE DETAIL WAS OFF THE PLOT WAS OFF AND HER SO CALLED SURPRISED ENDING WAS BEYOND SICK. IT WAS NOT WORTH MY TIME. I REALLY TIRED AND I GAVE IT A FAIR SHOT, BUT FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR A GOOD BOOK TO READ PUHHHHLLLLEASE AVOID THIS ONE."
1,el stinko de mayo,This movie is the worst of the worst. it smells like the most rancid road kill you ever encountered. if i had paid money to see this crap i'd be demanding a refund. as it is i was pissed off at free. (i belong to blockbuster all u can rent club at one price).so unless you need help sleeping or you are really gullible skip this one kiddies its a snoozer.
1,Dreadful!,Cheating hero and one of the weakest most ridiculous heroines ever written. I couldn't decide which one I hated more. Do yourself a favor skip it.
4,Great toy for the price and educational value,"My son loves to hit the number and the song is very pleasant, not annoying at all. Great buy! He is currently 10 months and I am sure he will put more use to the toy once he is older."
2,THE CORD IS SUPPOSED TO BE SHORT!,"We have the old version of this phone. Im not sure if this one has a cord that is on the front of it but ours did. Im writing this to warn everyone who is upset that the cord on this toy is too short. Ours had a cord for the phone and a cord to pull the toy with. I was in making dinner one day and i heard some crying and i walked in to find both of the two cords got tangled some how around one of my little boys neck! when i got it off there was a deep purple indent on his poor neck. Now i know some people might be saying i need to watch my babies more but only a mother of twins would understand how hard it is. Now the cord to pull the toy has been cut off, they still like the toy however. Im just glad i got to him in time."
3,Cord To Short,Our biggest complaint is that the cord is to short. We don't want our child to strangle herself but we do want her to have fun.
1,Disappointing,"'The fact that this book is subtitled ""How the Rise of the Next Superpower Challenges America and the World"" is likely one of the most clever and slick false advertising campaigns ever designed to sell a travel log to the public.'Could not agree more with you Dianne !!!Buying this book even at 5 bucks is a major rip off: the contain is highly disappointing.The author throws a multitude of facts and statistics that can be found in any newspaper or library without providing any analysis."
4,Good transaction,"The book is arrived about five days the expected arrival day, it's in perfect conditions, good packaging.It was a very good transaction!"
2,Unstable circuitry,I had to return this unit. When switched to the maximum boost or buck range several frequency bands were not stable and caused very loud ringing at that frequency. It was totally unusable. It seemed to work ok on the lower boost/buck range.
1,too simple,"I have tried several recipes from this book, the peanut butter banana and the orange cinnamon, and in both cases the batter was way too thick. This book may be a tidy compilation of waffle recipes on the outside (think crispy) but on the inside it is uncooked... and far too fluffy for what an ordinary egg white should do. Also it is a little too simplistic for my taste* ... there are no pictures or pairing suggestions or explanations of why egg white is necessary to waffles in comparison to pancakes, and so on. I am considering buying ""The Best of Waffles and Pancakes"" now to see if it is better, only because it is the only other book on waffles available on amazon.com, though one reviewer said it did not have enough pictures either. Good luck wafflers!"
1,Can't Read It,The print in this book was way too small for my 78 year old eyes. I couldn't enlarge it with my settings. Returned it for refund right away.
2,"Hello, please!","Well, I'm sorry to break the lucky 5-star streak that the book's had so far, but God the book was really bad. Boring doesn't cut it. If you want to read a good sexy book, go to Karen Kendall. Julie Kenner was a big disappointment. I did enjoy her book on the Bridesmaid Chronicles (but enjoyed K.K.'s much better). Read one of her books and compare... the $5.00 I spent on this book were the worst $5 I've spent on a book - EVER."
5,Cute and Fun--A Great Romp,"I read a lot of Harlequin Temptations. I always find them cute and funny and sexy. I have a few favorite Temptation authors, ones who really understand dishing up a romantic fantasy, steamy style. Julie Kenner does this well! Devin is yummy, to-die-for and clever. He knows how to keep Paris (the heroine) and the readers teased and breathless. I found myself turning the pages just to see what this outrageous duo would do next. Kenner has such a wry, engaging way with words. I laughed out loud quite a few times. I'm sure hoping for more from Julie Kenner. Really, no one does Temptation better!"
5,Great resource,"I've been playing guitar for over 25 years. I ran across Desi's podcasts and bought the book. I must say, I've been struggling with trying to learn modes, and major and minor scales for the last couple years. Everything became clear after reading this. It's as if a fog has been lifted.I think i've progressed more on the guitar in the last 3 months than in the last 25 years before it. I would hightly recommend buying this book, and listening to the podcasts (they complement each other) It costs less than one guitar lesson.Oh, and after you get the book, you still have to practice. But he gives so many song examples to practice along with, it's not boring."
5,Finally!!!,"I have been a guitar instructor for over 20 years, and have always been frustrated with teaching popular music, as there has never been any organized text to work from with students. Not any more! Fretboard Theory is an excellent book filling that void. Desi Serna has put a considerable amount of thought into the presentation of the material in this book, and listing actual popular song examples as ways of practicing the concepts he presents shows he's a real teacher. In my opinion, its the best book of its kind out today!"
3,OK. pleased so far,"I've owned a LaCie firewire for about a year now and I've never had any major problems with it. If you improperly eject a firewire you can have issues though-- but many firewire will do the same. I blame the previous comments on the iMac not jus the LaCie drive. I work with many people who talk pooly of the iMacs and all their bugs. I have had a few instances when I improperly ejected the drive and it didn't show up on my desktop-- but I slapped it around (literally), restarted my computer and waited a few hours and everything was OK. But yeah its not the greatest drive- looks pretty slick though."
1,don't buy LaCie drives - they will die young,"I bought a 60 GB LaCie Pocket Drive USB2/Firewire drive in August 2003, for $349.95 from Microwarehouse. Died December 2004, 3 months after manufacturers warranty ended.Customer service was unhelpful, told me that there are only 4 manufacturers out there, and all have the same warranty. So I'm out $350.00.My company also bought a LaCie d2 FireWire , 80 GB (300656) Hard Drive, which died after 3 months."
1,The Fast and the Furious Soundtrack,What happened to this CD? Where's the techno that i heard in the movie? What ever happened to Limp Bizkit? This soundtrack could have been a lot better.
2,Missing Songs,Its a rap album of songs that have with little to do the film. The songs that people are seem desperate to seek out are as follows.Deep Enough by Live (not quite sure from which part of the film!)Watch your Back by John Barnes (Fight at the beginning)Debonaire by Dope (Polce raid of Johnny Tran)and finallyNurega by Organic Audio (House Party scene)Hope this helps those of you who want a non or slightly less rap version.
2,ehhh,"where is that techno song that they were playin when they went back to the house after brian saved dom from the cops that is a nasty song and i was gunna get the cd for that song and the other techno but this is all rap...ja rule is cool but put it on me isn't even in the movie .... it was a great movie but i'm disappointed in the soundtrackmass, usa"
2,where is the good music?,"I saw the movie and loved it, i rushed out and picked up the soundtrack only to find out that most of the songs from the movie i liked werent on the cd. The movie had many good rock songs that didn't show up. The song were Vince was fighting with Brian outside Torretos store was awsome and not there. If anyone knows the name of that song, i would love an e-mail. Overall I am very dissapointed!! Dont buy!"
1,JUNK,"Did not broadcast with any consistency, jamming at times, then suddenly working and dumping huge amounts of material in one place, then jamming again. Finally, the crank just came off in my hand, and after spreading the remaining fertilizer by hand, I threw the spreader over the fence. This, in my opinion, is another example of a large company making a few extra pennies by selling items manufactured at the lowest possible price. Do not WASTE MONEY on this piece of JUNK. I will think twice before buying anything again with the Scotts brand on it."
1,This is JUNK,I owned an older version of this spreader for about 15 years and it worked great until it finally broke. I purchased the version 2 and I could not use it for more than one fill. It becomes too hard to turn the crank. Took it back for an exchange and that one also only worked for maybe two fills. Will be taking the second one back for a refund and looking for a different and better brand.
3,Great phone!,"It is a great phone with all the basic features you need,the only thing is that the battery does not last long and some keypads does not function as it says in the manual."
4,Connectors hard to get out,"I really like the length of the product and the cable itself seems to be high quality, the connectors themselves are a little tricky to get to release from your computer or modem. I have the trick down, but it is a bit more effort than what I would like. That is my only complaint."
5,Thank God it's on DVD now,Can't believe ABC canceled this show... now we only have 2 seasons to watch... groan...
1,Exceedingly mediocre....,"This is not by any means a collection of the BEST. There are a few classics, but not nearly enough. This is largely a tribute to the later years.A best-of collection simply must be more comprehensive, from the entire history of SNL, especially when the show had meaningful political satire and biting social commentary.In this collection, there are WAY too many parodies that are just juvenile, or at best adolescent. The best parodies were fine for almost all ages because they were quality. Aside from many being in bad taste, most of these just aren't funny."
2,Invest in Better Cords,"I was very disappointed with these cords. You should really invest in other cords, much better ones. I wish I had gotten some from Monster or a more trustworthy company. The metal pieces at the end of the cords always come undone and the cords are really poor quality. Trust me, invest in something better"
3,Have to be honest...,"As much as I loved these 2 in their prime, this is a bit lackluster. The playing was slowed down a bit and doc's picking is a bit sloppy these days (he is 82 yrs old). I also don't appreciate the first 3 songs (maybe the best ones on the entire DVD) being interrupted by little biographies. Couldn't you have put those bios somewhere else other than in the MIDDLE of songs (at least put them between songs)."
3,Good music - too much talk.,"When I purchase a concert DVD, I buy it for the music, not as a documentary of the artists' lives. Other music lovers might not agree. Worth the price for the music."
3,Lots of Loose Ends,"I'm glad this book had the variety of seeing Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan interact with other Jedi, but there are several major loose ends which is why I don't think it's as good as the other books. First, how did the parents even know their child was force sensitive? That was a real leap. Then, in a society with information so tightly controlled as that on Kegan, how did the parents even know where to send their message or how to get it out? Don't we think some safeguards would exist to prevent a regular person from sending a message out? Then, through several searches and confinements, Obi-Wan and Siri were allowed to keep their lightsabers, even though they were obviously not ""handwarmers."" However, the ending will send a shiver up your spine. I really like this series of books overall, but this one was a little weak."
5,You should take a peak at this book!,"This is another one of Jude Watson's great books! I like the plot, and how the story unfolds. I think that it was a good idea to have Siri and Adi Gallia go on this Mission with Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, because you don't really know that much about them before. (I don't think Siri looks to good on the front cover, but she is a GREAT character in the book! Second only to Obi-Wan!) This is one of the funnier books, and is on my list of top 10 Star Wars Books!"
3,Not for side sleepers,"My special needs 10 yr old wears these both day and night. He is still learning to use the bathroom, but likes the idea of not having to wear a diaper. Although the fit is great and they work really for him during the day and for short naps, I find that I have to use a pad similar to a sanitary napkin across the sides at night because he is a side sleeper and there is no absorbancy in the sides of these at all."
4,Real Live-F Marino and Mahogany Rush,"Breathless!! That's how this recording leaves you. Like a master painter this group leaves deft touches on their musical canvas. There is no lover of classic rock that can sit through ""Poppy"" and not be moved. Both a homage to those who tread before them and an innovative guitar tour de force; this cut alone makes the disc worthwhile."
2,"Frank is technically very good - but lacks originality,","One thing about Frank Marino is that he is a master at copying other great guitarists' styles and sounds. This DVD proves that in spades. This is also the reason why Frank's career never really took off.Frank lacks originality. He has no ""signature"" sound of his own, unlike other guitar greats like Carlos Santana, Johnny Winter, Jimmy Page, Ritchie Blackmore, Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen.Technically, there is no question that Frank is very good, which is why I find it so disappointing that he doesn't concentrate on developing his OWN sound. Copying other guitarists is like going to a karaoke bar and watching someone trying to sing like Frank Sinatra and Whitney Houston.Finally, this CD is far too long and repetitive. To me, it comes off as one huge Frank Marino ego trip and nothing more. Frank should also ease up on the gazillion special effects as well.My interest in listening further waned after the first 20 minutes."
1,JUNK,"Don't waste your money on this China made JUNK! When and if you get it started, it is so weak, you have to use it like a rack saw to even cut a small limb. JUNK !!!!! I've used it twice, oil leaking out of the bottom, doesn't oil the chain. McCulloch should be ashamed to put their name on this chainsaw."
1,My how times haves changed,"20 years ago I had a McCulloch saw and it was a work horse. This one is a piece of crap. Made in China (of course). Parts are loosely put together. It is cheap feeling. Most of all, it will not run properly and I wouldn't dare to try to cut wood for fear of something gogin horribly awry. Stay away form this bargain basement junk."
3,An Okay Read,I thought I was going to get a diffenrent read in christian entertainment but was dissapointed. What some people will do for money. I think I'll try another christian novel to read for recommendation to my book club.
4,Scooby-Doo is a child's video hero.,"I, for one, am glad that they keep making Scooby-Doo movies. The old stuff is still fun to watch and the new ones are great for me and my nearly 3 year old son. I have to admit though, El Chupacabra from this movie and the ghosts from The Boo Brothers is scary for my son to watch at nighttime so I don't offer it as a choice at night. In this day and age of foul mouths and violence on TV, I am glad to offer Scooby-Doo as a choice for my son."
2,Doesn't explain much,"This book doesn't explain things clearly. If you don't already know the subject, then it doesn't help much at all. I think that when you're looking to learn a subject that it's up to the writer to explain like you ""don't"" know. it doesn't! i just follow along with my instructor's in-class lecture to get information."
3,More about the pilots than the aircraft,"A great book about F-15E pilots experience in that war. It does not however specifically tell you anything much about how the aircraft performs or how it functioned in the gulf war out side of the pilots personal accounts. If you are interested in pilots war time experience - great. If , like me, you are more interested about the aircraft itself you might want to consider some thing else."
4,DIFFERENT BITS AND PIECES - DONT EXPECT A STORY..,"This book is a collection of Manson's entire testimony, drawings, lyrics, artwork, letters, articles, photos, poems and short stories by Manson. (If you're looking for details about the murders or Manson and his ""family"" l suggest 'Manson - in his own words'.) This book doesnt offer much detail about all that. It also has some interesting quotes from his philosophy, ""Maybe you lost your real self and your real life for paper with pictures of dead people on them"" ""The news gives you 5% of whats going on, and even thats distorted"" ""l was convicted of witchcraft in the 20th century and my case made the prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi filthy rich behind the book and film he wrote - enough said"". This book makes a good addition for someone who is already familiar with Charlie, the ""family"" and the crimes."
5,Mickey comes out great every time!!,"I was so excited to order this for my six year old son at Christmas. The waffles come out great everytime I use it! Just follow the instructions and enjoy. I use a ladle to get the batter in evenly. Doesn't take long to figure out how much batter is too much. I have found the Bisquick Reduced Fat to make really good waffles, even better when you drop chocolate chips or pecans on top of the batter before closing the lid. Always have extra batter and waffles freeze well in ziplock bags and make a quick breakfast before school. Too much fun!!!"
5,"One of the best, and I have seen 20 episodes already","Any episode where the mothers appear is very funny. Either the mother of Lenard or the mother of Sheldon. Also the ""girl friend"" of Sheldon Amy is also very funny."
4,Great show,purchased for my husband. He's a big fan. He was very happy with the set and decided to purchase more!No issues with this purchase.
5,Nerds rule!,"I have loved this show since the very first episode of the first season. My inner geek girl and Trekkie, really appreciates just how witty and chalk full of entertainment this show really is. You can't help but love all of the characters. Though, Sheldon is my favorite. My husband always says that I am a female version of Sheldon. I take it as a compliment...lol. Anyhow, I highly recommend this series."
5,a good laugh,Total 3rd season of what I think is one of the funniest shows on TV these days. Especially love Sheldon--he's so insulting and his friends just stand by him. I especially like Sheldon's phrase Bazinga!
5,LOVE THIS SHOW,This Show Has Been One Of My Faves Since Day ONE! This Show Is Going To Be Around For A Long Time
5,This was Xmas present,Shes really happy with now having all seasons to watch now. I'm a hero in my house. About time for that.
2,Overrated,"Good ideas and pictures, but it needs more informational depth and actual ideas as to the basic framing process involved with basement remodeling."
3,"Fun Continues, But Cast Changes","""Are You Being Served?: Volume 10"" is still funny but you can tell the plots are weaker and the cast is changing. We still have the colorfully coiffed Mrs. Slocombe (Mollie Sugden), cheeky Miss Brahms (Wendy Richard) and mincing Mr. Humphries (John Inman) in their territorial and quirky arguments, but you can feel the aging of the series, and laughter winding down. There are still laughs and smiles, but not as many. This disc includes the following episdoes: ""the Agent,"" ""The Punch and Judy Affair,"" ""Is It Catching?"" ""A personal Problem,"" ""Front Page Story"" and ""Sit Out."" Most of the discs run 3 hours and I find watching three series in a row, you need a break before you sit down for another 90 minutes. Overall still entertaining though."
2,Disappointed,"This item was purchased to be used at our winter address which is serviced by Comcast. When I tried to have the modem activated at the local Comcast office. I was told their system would not accept the serial number on the unit. I had the modem looked at by a Comcast technician today. who told me this was an obsolete model, might be stolen from the company. This was a refurbished unit. at a reduced price. however I am very disappointed in this. Will hesitate to buy electronics this way in the future."
4,"Item got here in 2 days, good seller",The only thing that needs to be done is set up the mac address and i'll be good to go. Item came in condition just like the stock photo presents. It also came as promised with the Ethernet Cat5 Cable and the power adapter. Item was here in 2 days from the date i ordered it which was december 9th. Good cable modem thats not too big and not too small.
5,great product,work very well. lots cheaper than paying rental to cable company. deliver on time as quoted.I should purchase this product 2 year ago.
3,Wouldn't work for me,"Although the unit I'm sure was a great product, but if you have phone + Internet + cable, this unit will not work because it doesn't have anywhere on the back of the unit to hook up a phine line connection to. So I wound up selling it, losing $10.00 on the deal."
4,Good Price,Compare to other brand modem.Price is cheap and quality is good.Keep internet down & up stream consistently.Way better than rental cable modem from cable company.Cheaper than rental cable modem (after 1 yr)
1,couldnt give it half a star,this modem is a piece of junk i cant give it .5 of a star or i would buy a motorola
1,bad adapter,I bought this modem because time warner started to charge the modem lease fee. The modem is same as one that time warner provides. But the adapter coming with this modem is cheaply built and does not work out of box. I have to use my old adapter.
2,Modem,"Internet keeps shutting off and the Internet company say's it's the modem, how can we check to see if it is the modem? It's not that old."
4,A Winner - Wartime Britain,"Wartime Britain is brilliant and very interesting. My wife and I thought the acting, directing, and screen play were first rate."
4,Mickey Waffles,Great Product for a Disney Fan! Same waffles that are served at Chef Mickey's in the Contemporary. Kids love to help make the waffles and then eat them. The only problem I had was one of the front shapes did not always make a complete shape. It takes a little bit of time to cook depending on the size of your family. (4 to 5 minutes to make 4 waffles)
5,Charles River Clothing is Great,"My daughter absolutely loves her Olympian Jacket. Did not initially get the pants, becasue was not sure of the jacket durablity. she has worn the jacket almost everyday for over a year and held up well. Ordered the pants. Well made and assume will hold up as well as the jacket.Love Cahrles River Apparel!!!"
5,Great Source of Info and Great Reading,"This book has an awesome narrative style that will keep students, history buffs and anybody interested. Mr. Amin's vast body of research and insightful illustrations shed great light on a sorely under-researched and very timely topic. This is a must-read!"
4,"not ""dreary"" as one reviewer put it","First, I wish to rebut the reviewer who calls this a dreary waste of time, -this is somewhat PC, yes. But it is the truth. These things did happen. It does not whitewash the ferocity of Indian tribes, but one must admit we were brutal also. Have you no heart, sir, to call this dreary? This documentary is fascinating and beautifully photographed. I especially love the story in episode 8 about David Love and Ethel Waxham, because I grew up in Wyoming not too far from the area they did."
1,selective and biased,"Well, I looked at the one star reviews before purchasing and thought they were blowing hot air. However, $60 later I find myself agreeing with them.The West according to Ken Burns, is a revisionist history which takes the phrase ""politically correct"" to mean ""selective historical moments to be presented in a totally biased way"".Getting away from the ""pc"" issue, the film is ""choppy"" in the extreme with no seeming connection between the 'events' being presented. If you like your history presented 'chronologically' (as I do) then this fails in the extreme.Now I know the liberal/marxist pc colors Ken Burns wears I will avoid anything else by him.One final point - before all you pc-ers start flagging this review down please appreciate I understand events do not occur in a vacuum, and that there is more than one side to a story - however, if you're honest you'll admit that more than one side was not given."
5,THE WEST (KEN BURNS PRESENTS),"I LOVE IT! I HAD WANTED TO PURCHASE THIS ITEM FOR A LONG TIME AND I AM NOT ONE TO NORMALLY DENY MYSELF MUCH; IF I WANT IT, I BUY IT! HOWEVER, THIS WAS ONE THAT I HAD ADMITTEDLY HELD OFF ON JUST BECAUSE I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE WITH SPENDING THE AMOUNT THAT IT ALWAYS SOLD FOR. FINDING IT ON AMAZON WAS A GREAT DEAL AS I FIND NEARLY ALL AMAZON DEALS TO BE. YOU ARE TREMENDOUS TO DEAL WITH. I BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE ITEMS I ORDERED FROM ""CAIMAN"". THEY HAVE BEEN MY FAVORITES TO DEAL WITH FOR EVERY REASON, SO IF I AM ORDERING THINGS LIKE DVDS, I ACTUALLY SEEK THEM OUT DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NEVER ANY PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER AND MOST OF THE TIME THEIR PRICE IS EITHER THE BEST OFFERED OR SO CLOSE THAT I CHOOSE TO ORDER FROM THEM. THEY'RE TERRIFIC!"
2,Not for the scholar,"As someone trained in neuroscience, I was curious about what kind of marriage could be made between science and theology. Reading this work, though, was disappointing for me. Supposing a Christian world-view [although this was not made plain up front], both the neuroscience and the theology were facile, lacking depth and scholarship. If you're a theology student looking for a scientific link, the level of neuroscience in this book is just about right; but for scientists, or those fluent in both fields, the book is lacking."
2,Don't buy it if you want to hear Sublime music,"This is a 28 song review of mostly So Cal punk and ska bands some of which are pretty good, most of which are not. The only thing it has to do with Sublime or Voodoo Glow Skulls were two lame interviews...so I was disappointed."
5,One Common Denominator,"Donna Hill returns with a thrilling novel about 3 women with one common goal, PAYBACK! Hill cleverly takes 3 very different women from 3 very different walks of life and brings them together through one common denominator. The main character, Tess, talks two strangers into committing murder in the name of retribution (now that's gangsta!) Do yourself a favor and read this novel. It's filled with suspense and several twists and turns. The story was so captivating, I read it in a couple of hours."
2,Not sure,I purchased this item noticing that the length of the handle would be perfect. The issue I had was the bristles being a little to long and toooo soft. I wasn't expecting a toooo soft scrub but this product bristles are really soft and long.
3,far from her best,"As a dedicated Lucinda fan, this recording came as a major disappointment. I doubt there is one song on this CD that is as good as any of the songs from her previous three efforts. Now, those recordings did not have a single weak song among them, so we are comparing against a very high standard.I was wary when I heard that, in contrast her previous work, she wrote and recorded these songs quickly. It sounds like it. Essence lacks the literary detail and musical vitality that distinguishes the Lucinda that so many of us have come to love. The songs drone on without enough structural variation. The press also praised a new looseness in her vocals. Well, they were plenty loose already. She sounds tired here.Poor Lucinda is still pretty good, but with all those other gems out there, why start here?"
4,"Lucinda Williams, Essence","This is a good album, I like her voice and the CD is in really good condition. Amazon does a great job withall my orders"
3,uneven,"You can't compare this to Car Wheels. You could believe that album took 7 years to make, it was so wonderfully crafted and had such a vivid sound. Well, you can believe this was ""rushed"" out in a year or two. The only song that really sticks is ""get right with god."" Many of the other songs are so slow and such downers that I just have to skip them or I can't make it through in one listen."
4,Sensual,"Lucinda Williams's latest album hits rock and roll right in the soul. She doesn't miss a beat with her earthy vocals and rocker-chick attitude.""Essence"" is seductive - it plain and simple expresses womanhood.Tracks #2, #3, and #4, ""Steal your love,"" ""Envy the Wind"" and ""Blue"" are so incredibly feminine and soft - a complete turnabout from the main track, ""essence"" that proves the versatility of this album. Williams rocks and rolls between these moods, seductive, feminine, and rocker-chick which makes this album a pleasure to listen to no matter what mood I am in or am trying to set."
1,Startlingly Bad,"Essence is such a weak, disappointing release that it is almost inconceivable that Lucinda Williams' loved ones and friends would have allowed it to be shipped. The absence of Steve Earle in the background is flashing like a big neon sign. The lyrics are manufactured from old issues of Southern Living and you can hear Ms Williams' trying to make her voice raspy and sad. Don't listen to this CD while driving; you immediately go to sleep."
1,essence,"I am surprised at the good press this album is getting. Lucinda Williams sounds almost intoxicated. Her enunciation is poor with slurred speech. The songs are not melodic enough for either folk,country or even any genere of pop music. The instrumentation is foggy and indistinct. I would rate it a zero if I could. I have seen her perform and she is great in person but doesn't come accross as well in the studio. She needs new studio advisors. From what I understand, though, she would refuse to take their advice."
5,"Lucinda gives hope on an otherwise bleak, generic 21'st century music scene","I just discovered this amazing singer-songwriter about two years ago with World Without Tears,a cross between Neil Young and Billie Holiday might be stating it too simply, but the first rate songwriting and real emotion to spare are undeniable, Bus to Baton Rouge literally brings me to the point of tears on almost every listening, I highly reccomend this and the other two cd's I have, Car Wheels On A Gravel Road and World Without Tears.Not a bad track to be found. Can't wait to see her live."
2,"BOO, BAD!","Not Fisher Price quality at all. I had purchased 2 of these and returned them the same day. The sound is pitiful! I couldn't hardly understand what letter it was saying so how could a young child? Also, when you put it on a letter it backed up to a different letter when you pulled the lever. Very disappointed!"
4,NEEDS IMPROVEMENT,"Our daughter seems to enjoy this toy. She loves pulling the handle down and making the pointer spin around. And she appears to like hearing the descriptions of the different nouns every time she does so. But the audio on this toy is not up to par. It is sometimes muffled so it can be very difficult to make out what it's saying half the time. And the corresponding sound effects are horrible. For example, the helicopter sounds nothing like a helicopter. But it is educational in that I can point to the different pictures and teach her what they are. This is certainly not a bad toy, but it could definitely use some improvement."
1,Not a Mega Man Game,"This is the dumbest mega man title yet. I was floored when i saw the game and first played it, but when i saw that there were no bosses and no charge shot, i felt betrayed. i did finish the game as i did not want to lose the money, just a big let down."
3,Very cute but a little messy,"When we got this item in it was a little dirty and smudged up. As I was 3 weeks from my due date and antsy to get the room set up (good thing because the little dude was born a few days later...), I cleaned it up instead of returning it. A little rubbing alcohol, Qtips and elbow grease and good as new! It has been up for over a year and is an adorable finishing touch to the room."
2,Colors are not as advertised,"I ordered the chamomile mat. It looks NOTHING like the shown color, not even remotely close. The tags on matdo indeed say Chamomile. Roommate ordered the Burgundy, same problem. It's not Burgundy.Be aware that the colors they are advertising the mats to be are not accurate."
5,comfy mat,The mat is nice and comfy and makes the workout much more enjoyable. Great color selection and a great value.
3,A little dissapointed,"I got my mat within two days of ordering which was awesome. However, at first i noticed it does cause some slipping during downward dog and other poses. I also ordered the ""seafoam green"" and it turned out to be lime green... a little disapointed with that. The thickness is great though and provides plenty of comfort for headstands on my wooden floors.Overall a pretty good deal for the price."
1,Color Blind,"The ""red"" is VERY pink. We sent them back and have yet to get a credit. What seemed like a great product turned out to be a bad experience for us."
1,Yoga Accessories Yoga Mat,"This yoga mat is not very good. I mean, there isn't much of a difference between one yoga mat and the next, but this one was a pretty bad one to buy. I've used it 5 times now and all I do is slip on it. The material is comfortable, but that doesn't make a difference if I can't even balance myself in down dog without slipping. DO NOT BUY. Find a different one. Got that Slate Blue crap."
5,"Extra thick, great price, awesome mat","LOVE the mat. It's super thick and was a great price. However, it does smell sort of funky. Just needs to be washed."
2,Not Sticky,"If you do gentle yoga that doesn't make you sweat, this might be a good mat for you, as it is nice and thick, providing a good cushion between you and the floor. However, if you do ashtanga or any other strenuous yoga that works up a sweat, you'll find yourself sliding out of downward dog and other positions again and again. I've had this mat for a while and have started using a Hugger Mugger Tapas mat on top of it, so I get the cushion without all the sliding."
3,It gets slippery when wet.,"I can't use it for hot yoga, but for regular yoga its ok so long as my palms don't sweat too much."
1,Late delivery,Merchant advertised that stock was available when in fact it was not. Was not kept up to date on the status of the delivery and only received it more than 2 weeks after the expected delivery date.
2,Not as expected,This is not extra think and is not as wide as other standard mats. Very disappointed with this purchase.
4,Love this Yoga Mat,"This mat is the perfect size and thickness. I use it for my exercise routine and it works perfectly. I was a little disappointed in the color, it turned out brighter than I thought. As far as function goes, it is great!"
1,Slippery when dry,"This is a slippery yoga mat. Your hands will slide, your feet will slide. If you like sliding and hate holding static poses you will love this mat.The mat matches the picture and was delivered on time. The new mat smell goes away after a day or so if you air it out."
5,A great mat for an affordable price,"I bought this mat when I wanted to start P90X and I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. From the reviews, I noticed that some people had some issues with the bad smell coming out of the mat but I did not have such problem. I can say the mat is almost odorless. I was about to be lured into buying a mat with similar specifications which would cost me around 90 bucks but I am so happy I came across this one and I ended up buying it. By the way, the ultra thickness does make a big difference. All in all, it is a great mat with a very affordable price!"
4,Yep it's a yoga mat,"Not much to say about this item, yep it's a yoga mat and does the trick. It is longer then I expected so that is a plus."
5,great yoga matt,"Perfect thickness, sticky enough for hot yoga, love the purple color and a great price. Received the matt before it was promised. Whats not to love :)"
5,Love the extra cushioning this mat provides,"I bought this mat because my ""regular"" mat just didn't have enough cushioning for the concrete floor at yoga class. My knees hurt terribly on many poses and even doubling my mat didn't seem to be a great solution. (It was bulky, clumsy and still not very comfy.)This mat is about twice as thick as a ""normal"" mat. That's a big difference to my knees! Plus, I think it helps with comfort in most poses. It seems easier to do balances on this mat. (It's also easier to do balances on grass or carpet for me--my feet like soft, cushy surfaces.)I shopped around online and in area stores and this mat is not only reasonably priced, but it's the best price I could find for a thick mat.If you are finding yoga hurts when you put weight on your knees, sit bones, palms, or whatever body part, try this mat."
3,Not sticky,"Sadly, this yoga mat did not live up to expectations. While there was only a very faint smell when I first opened it, the mat is not sticky at all. In fact, it is made from the same material as my cheap slippery mat that came with ""The Firm"" beginners set. I tried downward dog just to give it a test run and my hands were slipping at a considerable rate. I am pretty upset with myself for not investing a little bit more in the Jade mat.I washed the mat with soap and water and it is still drying. It has a foamy texture and really absorbed the water. I hope that this will do the trick and improve the surface a bit. I will still use this mat for pilates, though. Even though it seems too slippery for yoga poses, the mat is long, wide and thick. I'm pretty tall, so it is important for me to have a mat that will accomodate me. I got it in light lavender and it is really a pretty color- very close to the one shown in the picture.Overall, great mat for pilates, not so much yoga."
3,Affordable but slips,I picked up this mat because the ones at my studio were too short and too thin. This helped with both those problems but I was still stuck stacking a studio sticky mat on top of it so I didn't slip. I am a moderate sweater.
4,Good padding but slippery,"Love the padding - I no longer have to fold a blanket under my knees.Slippery - I strongly suggest to use a yoga towel with it. I purchased the AngelBeauty Microfiber Non Skid Yoga Towel Yoga Mat 24""x72"" with Carry Bag + Gift Box. Both products together = perfect!"
5,Great stuff,"Another doozy from this bluegrass powerhouse! Vincent has really got the goods -- this disc doesn't slow down or cheese out even once; it's just one really good, really authentic song after another, with solid picking that's as heartfelt as it is flawless. Banjoist Tom Adams holds down the floor, while Vincent's mandolin work is a melodic delight. If it sounds like I'm gushing, well... I am. This album is one of the strongest I've heard in years, with great song selection, soulful vocals and picking that can't be beat. Includes a nice tribute to Bill Monroe (""Is The Grass Any Bluer?""), a breakneck cover of Ernest Tubb's ""Nails In My Coffin,"" and an insightful gospel number called ""You Don't Love God (If You Don't Love Your Neighbor""). Highly recommended."
2,If you want a lesson on Jewish Morality...,"The only reason I gave this book 2 stars was because the meditations were good. However, for the author to start drawing moral and philosophical conclusions based on circular questions is ridiculous. For the most part the book is filled with the same nonsense you may find in any book on Judaism. If you believe it, great, if not, reading this book will certainly subject you to it. It is a poor attempt of legitimacy for various biblical phrases and 'ancient texts' (that were by most scholarly accounts written 1,000 years ago) through bad proofs, and decent meditative experiences - although whether the origin of some is judaic or not is questionable. This book is comparable to any other occidental religion trying to 'adjust' to a new paradigm, regardless of how many times the author cries otherwise."
5,Excellent value,"Best present the grandkids got, been playing with them non-stop. Boy and girl 5 to 7 Great for the imagination. Oh and I like them Too! Grandpa"
5,Best tape I've found-gives me energy!,"I'm 6 months pregnant with my second baby and I'm feeling great! I love this tape because for me, it does just as it says - it relaxes me and I feel like I have more energy when I'm done. I just pop the tape in when my 2 year old is down for a nap and I have time for myself and time to tune in to my new baby inside. I think Rocki the instructor really gets that. I have some other tapes, but this is the best one I've found."
2,Corn Zipper,"Although the corn zipper works well, it only removes 2 rows of kernels at a time. We find using a knife much easier."
1,Well Made,"I purchased this corn zipper because of the reviews. I should have read the product description, which clearly says, ""Sharp teeth cut between kernels and cobs removing two rows at once."" I should have looked at the photo better, which clearly shows that you can't see what you are cutting. This is great if you don't mind bad spots in with your corn, but makes it hard to ""zip"" the good kernels off and leave the bad. I'm guessing the manufacturer only shows the top view, because if you saw those two little teeth, you would realize that this is one labor-intensive tool!I used this tool on 1/2 ear of corn -- and that was enough. Not worth the money. I'm amazed that so many gave this thing a good rating. Lots of friends of the manufacturer???"
4,Good Reference Misses the Mark in Some Cases,"The Celtic Heroic Age combines together writings from Classical authors, Irish monks, and Brittonic storytellers in a fine collection of important mythological and heroic reference material. Koch and Carey use several good translations of the texts, including some of their own, to weave together a story as it may have been told in an earlier era. However, I was a bit disappointed that some of the primary sources of the mythological cycle, such as Cath Maige Tuired, were absent. Even missing some crucial mythological information, this is the best resource I have found so far for Celtic mythology and culture, brought together in readable language for modern audiences."
4,Riveting,"This is one of Huggin's better novels. It is captivating, exciting, and brushes upon (albeit rather vaguely) the earthly orchestrators of the evil forces arrayed against christianity. I rank it following Huggins other novels, Rora, A Wolf Story,and the Reckoning, respectively."
1,Made my cat puke,"This stuff is terrible, my cat would eat it and then vomit it up. AVOID at all costs, all of this brand did it."
5,Best salt ever!,"If you think all salt is the same, just try this! Because of its unique flavor and texture, you will use less and enjoy salted foods so much more. This is not your ordinary off the shelf salt. I have tried other products from the same Company and they too are unique, flavorful and well worth the little extra cost when you consider the enhancement to your favorite foods."
5,"A nail brush review? Sure, okay.","First, I can't find any decent nail brush at any grocers or pharmacy or Bed and Bath store. None!They all sell long soft wimpy useless garbage. These brushes from Amazon work. The wood is nice and hard so don't think they will split any time soon. The bristles on one side are great for under nails. The other side is okay."
5,German military vehicles,"This is an excellent source on WWII German armor. It gives general information on the scouting cars as well on the support vehicles. Some nice photos and shorts on the eight wheelers. If you like to model German armor this video, as well others in the series, would be one of your best DVD amor references.Stug III & IV - Assault GunsPanzer I & II: Light TanksTiger: Heavy Tank Panzer VI."
5,AN AMAZING WRITER,I HAVE THIS BOOK NOW FOREVER! THIS TIME IN HISTORY HAS ALWAYS AMAZED ME AND ELIE WIESEL MAKESYOU FEEL YOU ARE RIGHT THEIR. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT IT REALLY HAPPENED..................
5,Definitive..,"This is one of the best, ""punk"" rock album ever made. Its completely definitive, as was the Sex Pistols first record, of the new sound of ""punk"", ""new wave"" or whatever you want to call it sound. It doesnt get better than ""She Lost Control""...except maybe the 12"" remix (im not sure which i love more). For me, one of the best records made from the era."
4,Unknown Pleasures,"Unknown Pleasures being Joy Division's debut album and their 1979 release and one can say that this album sounds alot like Sisters of Mercy and The Cure. Songs that standout on this release are ""New Dawn Fades"", ""She's Lost Control"" and ""Shadowplay"". The front of the booklet is really nice but the booklet itself is quite sparse and contains no lyrics. 4/5."
4,"Solid, but not Closer","Unknown Pleasures is a solid piece of work, but it isn't the absolute classic that Closer is."
2,not the best score by horner,"No doubt that this is not one of James Horner's best score. I can tell this because the theme of the movie wasn't compatible with Horner's deep inner self, emotional style of music. Movies of this type such as Braveheart, Glory, Titanic, A beautiful Mind bring out the best in Horner. I recommend seeing the movie before buying any soundtrack. Some reviewers complained that the song in the commercial was not on the cd, it wasn't even played in the movie. You can't expect that for every movie(such as this and Saving Private Ryan). Another reviewer said that this cd was poor because it contained no Navajo songs(again none were played in the movie). Yes this album is poor, but not just because it doesn't contain any Navajo music."
1,Idiotic drivel,"So....if I look at the evidence that supports evolutionary explanations of the origin of species, and agree that evolutionary natural selection is the cause of the change seen in species, then I will become first, an atheist, and then Hitler, and try to destroy the world......OK. I guess that is why those radical Biology teachers hijacked those 3 jet liners and brought down the twin towers on 9-11...... Oh, wait, I forgot....those were RELIGIOUS zealots.Honestly, this movie is the most transparent propoganda piece ever created. A pathetic attempt to smear scientific advancement, and knowledge in general, in order to keep the masses indoctrinated into Ben Stein's particular interpretation of religious doctrine."
1,conspiracy-theory rant masquerading as investigative inquiry,"Here is an anti science proponent lambasting the evolution agenda and using the Holocaust to further his cause. I side with the Chicago Tribune and give this 1 star, simply because negative stars are not possible."
1,"A disservice to the ID crowd, a sideshow for the rest of us.","The backstory of this movie should be enough to fill even the most zealous with doubt as to the validity of intelligent design. From the bait-and-switch tactics used to lure credible scientists into appearing in the film, to misquoting Darwin in order to support the movie's erroneous and shameful link between Natural Selection and Hitler's ""final solution,"" to the EXPELLING of biologist PZ Meyers - who starred in the film - from an advance screening, the makers of this film seem to be uncomfortable approaching their project in an above-board manner. If I bought into ID (which I don't), I'd expect an honest and confident approach to the topic. A movie like this will assure ID's place on the fringes of fundamentalism."
5,EXCELLENT,"All I know is that every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall confess to God. We must pray for these one's who are blinded by the great deceiver."
1,Ignorant propaganda,"I was thinking of giving this piece of trash two stars, because some of the material in it is genuinely interesting, but the stench of its odious demagoguery eventually became too much.Just as it might be hard to identify which specific piece of garbage in a landfill stinks the most, so it's iffy to identify which specific piece of garbage in this film is the most rank. But I think its take on the Holocaust must be one of the top contenders. Richard Weikart's ""From Darwin to Hitler"" forms at least part of the basis for Stein's odious propaganda. I wrote a review of Weikart's book. You can read my review for the details of why its a such a weak foundation for Stein's propaganda."
1,Equating Science with Communism,"The very first scene in this movie shows you all you need to know: the Wall going up in East Germany by the communists. And Stein really wants me to believe that people who believe in evolution are like the communists ? It is not only non-sensical, but to me, very offensive. I have been in East Germany and I consider myself a Reagan conservative. This analogy between the Soviets - who murdered dissenters, and scientists, is cheap, ridiculous, and offensive."
1,And people wonder why America is fading,"If this sewage truly reflects the opinions and critical thinking ability of the American public, it's no wonder America is on a horrible decline.Ben and crew should be embarrassed by this self-destructive and intentionally ignorant film."
5,Chasing the rabbit,"I'll keep this brief.Ben Stein and his production crew approach with an ideal and an agenda, as do all documentary makers, but instead of forcing evidence into their model they actually follow much of their interviews up with research. A lesson most of the documentary makers out there need to learn.I like how this video isn't about creation or intellegent design or evolution, really. It's about the freedom to investigate. It's about the clash of world ideals. It's about the concept of ""what if"". What if we choose an amoral path? What if we choose a path of belief? What if all began with aliens? What if we never figure out what began the first cell?The video is also about who is answering these questions and by what authority.For those out there tossing pseudo-reviews based on what you've heard, partially saw, etc. You should really test and check yourself. It is worth its time."
3,I wont reccomend this and I wont tell you not to see it,"I refuse to recommend this movie, and i refuse to tell you not to see it. its good whenver anyone makes a movie presenting a viewpoint and the very essense of the movie again makes you understand this this too is an exercise in free speech. I turned this off 27 minutes into the movie because i had had enough by then. so take it for what its worth."
1,"ridiculous ""film""","I'll keep it short and simply say that anyone going into viewing this ""film"" with even an entry level knowledge of biology or history (or both) will be immediately insulted and ashamed and embarrassed for having watched it. Equating Hitler with Darwinism is revisionist history, and trying to blame Darwin for Hitler's depraved acts is a mendacious. This film is purely propaganda. Even Fox news rated it poorly (that says something in itself.) It's funny that PZ Myers was ""expelled"" from the theater showing after being invited to see it! Do a quick google search for ""expelled exposed"" to read the total deconstruction of the film by people who know what they're talking about."
1,Stein Hid His True Motives To Trick Darwinists. How Is That A Documentary?,"This movie doesn't even deserve a review. Ben Stein went to great lengths to lie about his movie in order to skew his interviews. If is so sure in his cause, why can't he let people voice their opinions with informed consent?"
1,A painful cacophony of belligerent ignorance,"Yes, I watched the movie (I sat for an interminable period of time in stunned silence at my parents' house).Not only is it ignorant of even the most basic, fundamental tenets of modern evolutionary thought, it's ugly conflation of anti-semitism and evolution should sicken rational, even vaguely intelligent viewers.Riefenstahl & Goebbels would have been proud to see their techniques used so blatantly in today's ""enlightened"" era."
3,Advocating expansion of debate on Darwinism,"""Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed"" is an interesting and slick expose of modern academia's attempt to silence any possible criticism of Darwinism.This documentary doesn't so much advocate that intelligent design is the 'answer' to the origins of life, but it does attempt to allow for the teaching of an academic theory that resolves the apparent conflict between science and religion.From the negative reviews of the mainstream media I expected ""Expelled"" to be amateurish and bible-thumping, but it is actually quite modest in its ambitions. If anything, it's worth watching simply to be introduced to Prof. David Berlinski, a real intellectual loose-cannon that will endear himself to anyone who has a suspicion of the university system and its academic pretensions."
5,Expelled is right on.,"The movie, Expelled, rings home true. The experience of those who discover scientific evidence that contradicts the evolutionary paradigm, but are silenced with intimidation when they expose that evidence, is more commonplace than you think. Those who rate this film as a 1 are no doubt part of the problem."
5,Brilliant,"I could talk for hours concerning the Intellectual Merits of this Film.Simply put: It's not a plea for simple-minded Creationism; It's a plea for FREEDOM of Intellectual Discussion.Think about it: What was the Status of Physics, of Mathematics, of Astronomy, of any modern Science in 1859 ? I'll tell you: Primitive at best.Yet those who blindly hold Darwin as their Savior, cling now to ideas 150 years old ! Darwin did not build a stairway to the truths of Evolution, but only a first step. His theories are valid, but woefully incomplete.It is well past the proper time to put Darwin in his place: as a Pioneer. Each year that passes poses new questions, new incongruities, new problems with strict Darwinism. A fresh approach will bring us closer to the answer.Those who hold each word in ""On The Origin of Species"" as a literal truth are just as deluded as those who hold each word of the Bible, or Koran, to be just as literally true.It is time to move on."
1,Bias and Dishonest,"The right questions were never asked during this film and you get the feeling that that wasn't the point. It also demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the scientific process. Science and truth aren't democratic and have no agenda. The just are. IF someone can produce real evidence of intelligent design, it would get published. That is why ""teach the controversy"" just doesn't work. As far as science is concerned, there is none. This documentary could have been so much better if he had tried to do it honestly."
2,Dishonest and biased.,"From his gratuitous misquoting of Darwin (Descent of Man) to his exploitative interviews with Dawkins and Myers (who believed they were being interviewed for a different film), Stein offers not one glimmer of concern for honesty or integrity in this frankly awful film. As a work of propaganda is is sure to be effective, but it loses all moral high ground with such underhanded tactics. It is thus most effective as a demonstration of the remarkable lengths creationists feel they are permitted to go to get to the truth. If you have to lie to get there, that can't be a good sign."
1,Conspiracy theories and little else,"Wow, anything more dishonest I've never seen. I thought at some point that Ben Stein was an intelligent fellow, but after seeing him fall for this Intelligent Design creationism garbage I think he's an utter dolt. The movie is sheer propaganda for the Discovery Institute and their nutty, ignorant ideas; nothing else. The misquoting of Charles Darwin's words is shameful, and the implied link between evolution and Nazism has to be one of the most vile and revolting things ever suggested. That Hitler thought he was doing god's work by killing jews is, of course, never mentioned."
1,A pack of lies,"This film is a pack of lies, poorly presented, and unbelievably tedious. I was unable to watch the whole thing. It made me so angry I couldn't bear it. I lasted about 45 minutes."
1,"Whatever your feelings on ID, this is a DULL movie","I found this documentary rambling, uninformative and downright dull. No matter what your beliefs on the subject matter, I wouldn't waste my time."
4,Good job; could have done better,"I think that Ben did a great job of showing that the emperor has no clothes when it comes to the beliefs of the Darwinist establishment. He also did a good job of showing how Darwinist propaganda affects a nations views (Nazi Germany). I wish he had shown more of the substance of Intelligent Design and how it stacks up against what substance there is for Darwinism. I guess his real goal was not to weigh the issues, but to call for a level playing field so that Darwinist ideas of life's origins can properly be labeled as superstition instead of posing as science. By that measure, I'd say he succeeded."
5,"excellent, thought-provoking movie",Great movie which gives much to think about. Academia is stumbling into the abyss of hubris and ignorance. Thanks to Stein and company for this movie
3,DOESN'T WORK LIKE A TURBO TWIST,"I couldn't tell any difference in power being that this one is a 450 watt. I had a 400 watt and it burned up and this one has a funny smell like it's going to burn up too. Also, mine was an open box item. I was hoping for better performance since I use my blender a lot. I hasn't crushed all the ice cubes yet when making a frozen drink."
5,Engrossing,"Just want to add my praise. Cadbury's compelling writing adds to the already enthralling story. One of the best books I've read in a long time. Beautifully researched and organized. Great history, yet it rivals the best of fiction."
5,Piece of mind,"Easy to install, look great, no rust after 3 months. great price 2 day delivery. Key is heavy duty, best price I could find"
4,great flick,"Why I forgot about this movie; this is probably one of the few movies of that era that my father took me to see; sadly, I forgot about watching it, but thank you [...] for hipping me to it."
1,"Bad book, select much better books by Laithi or Oppenheim",Terrible book. Would recommend books such as Oppenheim's Signals and Systems or Laithi's Linear Systems and Signals.A very good book on the subject that is easy to follow as a quick guide is Signals and Systems Made Ridiculously Simpleby Zoher Z. Karu.Stay away from Roberts book if at all possible. Confuses even easy to understand topics.
4,Perfect for the traveller on his own!,"Great detail and a perfect size for walking! Completely opened it is 9"" X 33"" and is fan-folded to a convenient 9"" X 4"".This map will last a life-time. The metro stations are clearly marked, along with all the major attractions. Rome is easy to doon foot."
2,Too Small,"I was wishful that this map would live up to its siblings but I was very disappointed. While the streets are accurate and well labeled, the area of coverage is just plain silly. If you don't care to see the area east or south of the Piazza Navona, this map might work for you. Otherwise you will be far better off with the free maps that are offered at just about every hotel. They cover the area from north and east of the Villa Borghese and down below the Circus Maximus."
1,Don't bother,I bought this map for a trip to rome. It proved to be a major frustraion throughout our vacation. I did much better with the free map that I got when I bought the Rome city pass.
4,Good old wreckless fun!,"the whole dvd set is pretty much enjoyable. you get rik mayall and adrian edmondson's old comic antics. all the episodes are all quite amusing, very entertaining humor. i know this is a whole other comedy show, but i find the young ones more enjoyable to watch. still bottom is a great show to watch if you love wreckless, fun comedy!"
4,Nice....,"Here's some smooth, bluesy jazz. Not the slow sad kind, but the fun, high-steppin' kind. Very good and a great CD for a music lover's collection. This one will get you movin'."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"At a bargain price, I didn't have high expectations. So it went into the 5 disk CD player in shuffle mode, while I did the Sunday crosswords. Noting Leon Parker's ""Caravan"" & the haunting ""I Cant Give you Anything but Love"" by Terence Blanchard, I gave the CD first up during Monday nights, reading on the porch detail. The refreshing mix even perked the ears of the Mrs. who normally tries not to listen. ""Barbados Delight"" & ""Shades of Gray"" pleasantly surprised, while only Bela Fleck's ""Zona Mona"" seemed subpar compared to some of their other work for which I am more accustom to. All in all, a delightful hour of entertainment."
4,Wagon Train-John McIntire,"Very good, although I expected th have series fearuring Ward Bond but maybe that was my fault."
3,This story falls between chairs,"The author's writing style is clever, but its ironic approach towards fantasy is not as imaginative or successful as, for example, ""The Phantom Tollbooth.""What some reviewers have described as clever wordplay is just using uncommon English words with wrong meanings. For example: He uses the term ""pismire"" (which is an ant) for a gun. Why? This doesn't amuse me.For me, this book invites comparison with ""A Wrinkle in Time"", ""Bruno and Sylvie"", and ""The Phantom Tollbooth."" However, it doesn't compare well with them. Another book that comes to mind: Italo Calvino's ""The Nonexistent Knight and The Cloven Viscount,"" both for character traits and for attitude; but the Calvino book is far finer."
4,GREAT!!!,"I think that this is a great album. I believe that it is not receiving as great reviews as it should because it is not really pop(which is what Michael is really known for)but consists more of ballads and r&b; tunes and also was not promoted at all by sony/epic.However it is alot better than Brittney spears and all those stupid boy bands that sing these empty tunes that are selling more records.Also the music industry is just messed up nowadays. All it is interested in doing is selling sex, not good music. Keep up the good work Michael jackson. ( i am not a michael jackson fanatic, but an objective evaluator, in case you are looking to say that this person is just another mj freak fanatic)"
4,"Pretty Solid, But A Few Weak Links...","Overall I'll say that I am impressed by this cd. I wasn't expecting much in this day of great artists turning to crap, and when I listened to the CD the first time, I wasn't impressed at all. But I persisted, and after a few times through, I really like it.THE most solid track is #15,""Whatever Happens,"" featuring Carlos Santana on guitar. It's a VERY good song, with a kind of haunting feel to it. Kind of reminds me of ""Little Susie"" at times, but I feel it is a better track overall.The first 3 songs are similar, dancy type songs. BUt please don't assume that that is all the album brings. The remainder of the album are soft, beautiful ballads. The best of these I would have to say are tracks 8, ""Speechless,"" and 14, ""Lost Children."" Very, very nice.All in all, I am impressed."
4,Back to Off The Wall,"I think Mike has went back to the old school and gave us what we used to hearing from him. Very Good job, my personal favorite is Break of Dawn. First 8 songs are off the hook! Stay with what you good at Mike...1 luvLaura"
4,"Too much hype, too much criticism","If you buy this CD expecting a new musical breakthrough the likes of ""Thriller"" or ""Off the Wall,"" you may find yourself a little disappointed. With ""Invincible,"" Jackson isn't reinventing pop music. It's more like a return to his roots - songs like the hit ""You Rock My World,"" ""Break of Dawn,"" ""Heaven Can Wait"" and the gorgeous ""Butterfly"" are refreshing in their soulful simplicity, especially after his inspired but bloated last effort, ""History."" When Jackson is singing about love, he's terrific; the ""message songs"" like ""Privacy,"" ""Lost Children"" and ""Threatened"" don't come off as well. It seems as though Michael is desperate to defend himself to his listeners, but his fans will love him as long as he keeps putting out impeccably produced feel-good grooves. All in all, despite the criticism resulting from an over-abundance of hype, ""Invincible"" is a solid set of songs that live up to the standards of the former pop king."
3,The Return Of MJ:,"well let me knock all the usual Problems here which Hurt the Set.Sappy Ballads too much of that&Tired DarkChild Produciton except on a couple cuts the first single ""You Rock My World"" trips me out.a tired 80's theme as the DarkChild Track.but now the Plus Side ""Whatever Happens"" With Carlos Santana Tight.""Butterflies"" Very Soulful.""Break Of Dawn"",""Heaven Can Wait""""Unbreakable"" are Must Have Jams.MJ is a Smart Artist e Knows what makes a Good Album Nowadays&He has that here.now of course things aren't on the same Level as the Old Days but this Album can Easily School anything going for Pop&R&B Now.The Knock is gonna be because it's MJ because of Expectation but when you Listen carefully at what's out now then you see MJ Brought the Goods.His Vocals Sound the Best they have on a whole in Many a Moon.Be He Loved or Loathed you can't deny MJ.the Music,Production,Arrangements are on Point here.MJ does alot more on His Records than Many folks think."
2,sony did promote this......,"..... I know cause I bought it. Michael was such a great entertainer. I expected great things, however for spending 35 million dollars on this album he wasted his money. Why did the album not do well? play this next to THRILLER or OFF THE WALL and you will know why. One of the points is we can't judge him on terms of his music alone any more. He brings up his personal struggles in his songs all the time. There are some good songs on this album like YOU ROCK MY WORLD however there are alot of martyrdom songs. The part where sony did not promote this is hogwash. The week this came out he was everywhere. On vh1, trl,instore signings, and to top it off he through himself that big starstudded tribute. I think people are finally giving up. Michael needs to get back to what made him good. Cut the star studded galas, cut the whiny why are they picking on me songs and give us your dancing and a killer r&b band and not this glossy sheen production."
5,Addictive,"WOW!! What can I say?? Im ""speechless"". I have never really been a fan of the man, but after hearing this album, i have listened to a couple of his other albums aswell, and my conclusion is....the man is a true genious.10/10 - Threatened, Whatever Happens, Privacy, 2000 Watts,Heaven Can Wait9/10 - Unbreakable, Heartbreaker, Invincible, Butterflies8/10 - You rock My World7/10 - Break Of Dawn, Speechless, You are my life,Don't Walk away, Cry, The lost ChildrenBUY IT, OR MISS A PHENOMONAL ALBUMI have to be honest though.... it isn't quite as good as Thriller"
4,Worth It!,"""Speechless"" and ""Whatever Happens"" are worth the price. The rest is up to your taste. But one day, when the chips are down and you don't know what's around the bend, you'll NEED those two songs. I promise you.RM"
5,The real KING Makes his comeback in STYLE,"This CD iz an absolute masterpiece. I got it yesterday (it came out earlier in Australia) and nothing more can be said about it, other than that it is totally brilliant. The standout tracks are Unbreakable with Biggie, You Rock My world, The lost children, speechless, threatened... i could go on and on... but i wont y'all! This is real music, something for everyone, Rodney Jerkins has done a great job with MJ... watch out for this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!bdw David Fletcha iz da bomb"
5,Invincible is the best album of 2001,"Michael Jackson's Invincible is the best album of 2001 because it combines R and B, Hip-Hop to produce the most groundbreaking music on the new millenium. All the upbeat songs on the album are potential hits, they are all melodic and lyrically superior to any artist out there. He gives us a different sound then we are used to, a better sound in fact. There are only 2 filler songs on this album. The slow songs are great to. Break of Dawn is by far the best song of the millenium and if it was put on the radio, it would be an instant hit."
2,infantile re-hash,"I've never bought a micheal jackson record, and I'll not start now that he's gone....but whenever I heard them on the radio..or at a friends place... I noticed the songs all began to sound the same. Stuck in an 80's rut... the dancing, the wigs and make-up, the juvenile singing....all designed to keep him an innocent itty bitty little boy in the public's mind. Never getting older, in his fantasy riddled mind, he seemed to be our dream of never changing never aging, so we seemed to admire his antics, without really questioning what a sordid lifestyle he must have been living"
4,"Good, but NOT BLOW YOU AWAY","This album is pretty good, but don't expect it to be on par with ""Thriller"" or ""Dangerous""!"
1,Shamon Now!,My take on the people giving this piece of junk a favorable review is as follows:AGE <12IQ <12
1,What a let down!!,I highly anticipated this album when it came out. But boy was I disappointed. The only good song is 'Butterflies' and he didn't even write it himself!Don't buy this album and if u do then listen 2 it and realise that u wasted ur money!!!
5,This is Hot!,I love this CD!! It rocks! The beats grip ya and won't let you go. Another excellent release from Michael. I have all of his cds - he is the master of The Groove. If you can enjoy his music without dwelling on his eccentricities you will be most rewarded. Love it!! Rock on Michael!
5,The King of Pop Returns,"I was waiting to get this CD the moment it came out and I must say that I wasn't disappointed. I have heard three other songs on the net, which were ""Rock My World"", ""Butterflies"" and ""Cry"", and I liked all three, so I had to see what the others had to offer. As for the Invincible album overall, Michael is great as ever. Each song I was able to digest very well with the new R&B sound that Jackson creates for several songs while mixing it with his familar signature sounds. And, some of his slower stuff like ""Break of Dawn"" and ""Speechless"" were fun to listen to as well. The one song I really wanted to hear was the one where I heard Carlos Santana, being a fan of his music, played a guitar solo and that of course is ""Whatever Happens"" and I thought that was a great contribution as I recognized it. Although the CD is not revolutionary by all means, but the sound is great all the way through. I highly recommend this for all MJ fans."
2,weak comeback,"By 2000, the idea of being invincible was descriptive of everything that Michael Jackson simply wasn't. That's not to say the title of his 2001 release ""Invincible"" is irrelevant. Jackson probably used the media's radical exposure of his undeniably abstract (and often controversial) lifestyle to his advantage and thereby, preserving his ""invincibility.The bulk of ""Invincible"" seems like recycled pieces of ""Off the Wall"" songs all mixed in a blender. Ten years later, with this album in it's entirety considered, that is a dissappointment. Michael can't seem to fuel the airwaves through pop mainstream and he can't satisfy long time fans by providing diverse, catchy songs. He had the ability to give us memorable lyrics and R and B beats as he proved with his 80's releases, but in the state he is currently going towards, that's highly unlikely."
5,Micheal Still Has It!! Like Him Or Not!!!,I puchased this CD on the first day because the first couple of singles have been getting mad airplay. (Rock My World and Butterflies) I am glad I did. This album is well produced and worth the money he invested into it. His vocals are still silky smooth and he can still perform. A lot of people I know are MJ haters but when you think about it who can take the crown and keep it for long as him? Who has the stage presence? Still sellout crowds across the world and still make the best videos? (Short films) For longer than I have been alive he has been in this industry. He truly has longevity!!! That's why he gets five stars even though the remix with JAY-Z aka blueprint isn't on here.
1,King of Crap!!!,"to bad none of the young generation that MJ is so desperately trying to appeal to remember the days when he actually had talent. now he needs to enlist the help of like a million producers and songwriters, resulting in a record that sounds so bland and generic it makes me ill.Michael, why dont you just get a great soul band together like you should have done 15 years ago..."
5,Under-rated wonder,I don't understand why this did not sell better when it came out. It's FABULOUS! I love Michael's new stuff and it shows where he was in his life at the time. Ever changing to keep up with the times.
4,maybe not his best but this is an underated c.D,"MMM after 6 years of hiding michael jackson is back with a sleeve full of tricks.Basically i took off one star because to me it does not sound like a classic Michael Jackson Album Not many absurd Out breaks like ""HEE Hee"" that we know and love michael for. But in reality This is a very good C.D Great power songs but the key to this album is The ooey Gooey Rnb/Soul tracks that he puts out! though its a little strange taking note that jackson is talking about making love but its still hott! If Michael shells out another C.D like this only with a few better songs and better promotion! he just might beat thriller cause we all know he is chasing thriller! cause we are all chasing thriller!"
3,"It's good, but by MJ standards, it's a C+/B- album.","This album has a couple of really nice cuts off of it with ""You Rock My World"", ""Unbreakable"", and ""Break of Dawn"". They're all very nice songs, and ""Whatever Happens"", and ""Speechless"" aren't bad, but when you compare this album to OFF THE WALL, THRILLER, BAD, and DANGEROUS, this album is treated like a spare tire. Hopefully Michael Jackson's new album coming this fall (2007), will be better. If he can release more songs of ""You Rock My World"" quality and put out another ""Billie Jean"" or ""Beat It"", then we can really say the King of Pop is back, but if he's putting out another Invincible, I will be kind of sad. That all being said, being the MJ fan that I am, I'm still going to buy the new album, because I'm confident it will have one or two cuts worth having."
3,MJ fan,"Not as good as his others, but if you're an MJ fan, it is a must have. It has some great tracks."
3,A Star Is Fade-in,"The king of pop made a great return. ""You Rock My World"" was that song, we have been waiting for since ""Blood On The Dancefloor"". It is a new Jackson classic. But this album is far from his best. I hoped it would be the best pop album in the year. But even sister Janet makes better songs. Michael are overproduced. He have tried to much. All the uptempo songs alright, but the ballads are to many. How many times are we gonna have to hear ""Heal The World""? Even this, it is still a better album then Sony Records seems to think. They should give it a chance. If they release ""Whatver Happends"", they will see, Michael on Top 10 of the Billboard chart again. Becourse that song, it in best Jackson/Santana style. Michael is still the king, only threat can be in the futher: Robbie Williams."
2,MJ Can Do Better!!!,"Please don't get me wrong, I LOVE MICHAEL JACKSON!!!!! But ""Invincible"" is by far his worst album yet. I waited in the cold all morning to be the first one to buy it when it came out, but I was very disappointed once I had listened to it.Michael Jackson, in my opinion, is the most talented musician alive today, without a doubt, but ""Invincible"" seems too self-conscious. It's as if Michael keeps trying to replicate Thriller's success without taking any risks. ""The Lost Children"" is one of the worst MJ songs I have ever heard. He tries to cater to children too much with his music but he has to realise that they aren't the ones that fork over the money for his albums.I'll always be a fan of Michael's, he's the greatest, I just hope he realises that there is a reason why ""Invincible"" isn't lighting the world on fire -- because he is capable of producing much better music than this."
3,Is he still the King Of Pop??,"Though this album is not bad, I would have to say that it's an average album overall, but not as good the Michael Jackson albums from Off The Wall to Dangerous. Better than the HIStory 2nd Cd though.The ballads on this album (Butterflies, Speechless, You Are My Life, Cry, Lost Children)are very nice and have a very harmonious melody. However, the funky tracks that made Michael a unique artist lack of originality, and pretty much you would skip a lot of them. You Rock My World is the only one of them who stands above the others, and perhaps Privacy.If you're a true Michael Jackson fan, get the album, but if you're just the kind of person who like some of his music and expects this to be his best work ever, then don't buy it."
2,Time to go back to the roots,"This album, thumbs down. This album is NO WHERE as good as Dangerous, Thriller, or Bad. He is trying WAY to hard to get a new generation of listeners. Tomorrow he is on TRL on MTV. What is this? This isn't his ""generation."" I think this album should be in the economy bin. Maybe 2 songs on it are decent, but NOTHING stands out like his old albums. Black or White song was better than anything on this new album.A Definite PASS. Go buy Jackson 5 Greatest Hits cd"
3,GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT,"Not to bad of a book, so buy the least expensive book available. Some of the governmenr stuff is true, I wonder how the author found out. It takes a little getting use to his writing style. His interpretation of the end times should make one think about reading the bible and shoring up they faith in Jesus. Whether it will happen in the fashion that he wrote it . . . don't know what to say.The ending was weak. Several chapters used to built up the coming of the great decite; takes only two paragraphs to describe the closing of the gate."
1,wasted effort,"Could have been a good book if the authors possessed a shred of talent. Appears to be a written info-mercial for his website. Characters are weak,plot is thin, predictable. Actually its ridiculous, a waste of time and money."
2,My house still stunk!,"I purchased this product for my greyhound who, if you've ever known one, had the typical problem for them which is unbelievably foul flatulence.A local specialty pet store had recommended this product but were out of it. Their review of the product had me really excited, so I bought this online.After two weeks on the product (sprinkling it over his food at the recommended dosage for his weight) there was no appreciable difference.But, all's not lost ~ I did find a solution!! Non-fat, plain natural yogurt! Two dollops, twice a day, we're odor free!!"
5,Incredible,"I am so glad I got this CD. It is rare to hear Jazz go in a new direction. The compositional vision on this recording is revolutionary. Fans of Andrew Hill, Mcoy Tyner, Steve Topping and Bartok would love this CD."
5,The illegitimate child of Johnny Hartman and Sarah Vaughn!,"Fans of classic vocal jazz will be blown away by this album. Jeffery Smith sounds like the illegitimate child of Sarah Vaughn and Johnny Hartman. In a world of fakes, this is the real thing..."
2,Hellboy costume issues,"Well first the coat is fine. The mask is OK but I would much rather had gone for the full face one now. The hand is pitiful. It is a flat piece of latex with two cheap straps you put around your wrist, it is not even inclosed like a glove and looks nothing like the photos."
2,Too Messy!,"This is the third juice extractor we've tried so I am starting to know what I'm talking about. There are too many parts to remove and clean on this one, and the base becomes a big mess, too. The fruit that is left is very wet still, so we're getting too little juice for the amount of fruit. And the place where you put the fruit in is too small. It takes way too much time to prep the fruit small enough. I was very disappointed in this juicer, to say the least."
1,Not for mobile use,"We were looking for a cheap/flexible mobile dvd player. This is not it. The unit works fine untill you move it. It skips, and skips, and skips.....They should note that it is NOT for use in a moving vehicle (and why include a cigerette lighter adapter?) The good news...the vendor issued a return authorization with little hassle."
1,Junk,This thing broke beyond repair after minimal usage. It runs hot and is very heavy. The battery life is not acceptable.Buy a cheap laptop instead.
5,A DREAM PERFORMANCE,"Personally among all Bruckner's symphonies, I like most the Eighth, especially the ""Adagio"". I don't feel this symphony and the adagio too long, heavy and redundant or rethorical, as someone thinks.The tension, the ""aura"", the depth that Furtwängler brings to this score, are so incredible, astonishing, marvellous that you'll feel every note absolutely necessary.Truly a great experience!"
5,"All I have to say is buy it, now, right this second!!","The best in modern jazz Medeski, Martin, and Wood team up with a legendary guitarist. The sound is dreamlike,the first time I heard it, I fell in love with it. Defenitely a must have for any fan of jazz or any music genre for that matter. One of the best albums of the 90's that noone hears."
4,A Go Go,"John Scofield, along with Medeski, Martin, & Wood, offers a great combination to produce excellent jazz. The upbeat tempos and funk-based bass lines are all wonderful, however, I found the CD at times to be monotonous in tone and often lacking in the variety part of it. Though great as it might be, and as much skill as it takes (as a guitarist I would know), I'd have to give this a 3.5 star because it lacks in variety and development in the songs. Perhaps the first 4 songs are original and wonderful, it truly impressed me, after that it gets kind of old...until you get to Hottentot. This is perhaps the best song of the album, the solos are unpredictable, original, and great. It develops from the funk based rhythm to a more fusion and harder beat song. Overall a pretty good album."
1,"SADLY , SADLY","WEBSTER WOULD SAY THAT I AM ""AFFECTED WITH UNHAPPINESS"" AND HE WOULD BE CORRECT. THIS OFFERING IS REPETITIOUS AND BORING. A GOOD THOUGHT CRAMMED IN A NOISY BOX AND OCCASIONALLY ALLOWED TO SURFACE. SEE A PAIR OF HANDS GLEEFULLY RUBBED TOGETHER AT THE CLINKING OF THE COINS THIS HYPED UP CLATTER IS GENERATING? THERE IS TRUTH IN ADVERTISING IF YOU LOOK CLOSE ENOUGH."
1,dismal customer service,"I loved my first trager backpack. After many years of use it eventually came apart at the seams. I liked it so much, that I bought another. The same thing happened, the seams came apart, but this time it happened almost immediately. I contacted Trager and they asked me to send it in for repair or replacement. I did this. Then I NEVER heard back from them again. I have emailed, called and left VMs and tried everything. They have never responded to me. I now have to buy something else as I have been without the bag I was using every day. I will not buy another Trager product."
5,Best of times,"Well,where to start.This is the season of the series when CBS pick it up.The are a few episodes that were only shown in Synication.It has some really memerable episodes on the Disks including the controversial episode ""Rapheal Meets his Match"".This is a very nice set.Brought back som great memeries.Though I wish that Mona Lisa would have made another appearance but thems the breaks."
4,Not bad,"The non-stick coating didn't even last a month and began flaking away. But once we removed it all from the bottom, everything worked fine. For the money, it does exactly what I wanted - heats up water and keeps it warm all day. Worth the purchase."
2,Not what I expected.,I must have misread the description on this item. I thought I could do more than boil water with it. No brochure came with it to describe uses.
5,Clem Snide in Wisconsin,"I was convinced by a friend to go see Clem Snide at the Miramar Theatre in Milwaukee, WI. I had never heard their music much less heard of them. They played with Jimmy's Comet and Mark Waldoch that night, and I must say it was the best [money] I've ever spent. I had no idea what to expect but walked away a huge fan. I even drove to Madison the next day to see them again. The music is AMAZING. Just when you think the song is gonna be slow, like ""Don't Be Afraid of Your Anger,"" it turns out to be upbeat and silly. ""Evil vs. Good"" has some great horn and strings rifs, and ""Moment in the Sun"" makes me wanna sing along. ""Long Lost Twin"" cracks me up and makes me a little sad at the same time. I highly recommend listening to these guys. I didn't even know they existed and now I'm telling all my friends..."
4,Another very good album....,"It's not quite as strong as ""Your Favorite Music"", but this is still one of the best things I've heard this year. I think it's worth the purchase for the song ""Ice Cube"" alone, easily one of the best and the catchiest things Clem Snide has done yet. Definitely recommended."
5,Simply Wonderful,"After enjoying this and the Simply Grand CD, I must say that Gary Clark truly feels then shares the music. You can feel his musical emotions throughout each and every song. His musical talent is mixed with a true love of creating the music thus making each song so much more than just piano playing. I hope to see a third CD out soon and continued success in the future."
1,An emberessment...,"Just think of the poor elephant to was killed for hsi tusks to make this awfukl cheesy listening cd. Just bloew average easy listening piano, with no uniqueness, and really it's not all that beautiflul, but as they say beauty is in the eyes of teh beholder, so listen and judge for yourself, but to me it's just boring, uninteresting music, and tehre are at least a couple hundred better pianists out there, so why on earth bother with thsi drek."
2,Loud and Annoying Trash,"I did not like this album at all.. Much like most rappers from Atlanta, their Loud screaming is just not music!.. I only recommend this to fans of this club hopping loud rap... But, from my opinion, its just not worth listening to"
3,WHAT?! OKAY!,"I love Lil Jon but there are two things I must point out about this product. First, if getting on vinyl, its a single. Or atleast the one that I recieved was. On side A there are three different versions of Put Yo Hood Up. Radio, street, and instrumental. Total time around 14 mins. On side B there are three different versions of Cant Stop Pimpin. Radio, street, and instrumental. Total time around 18 mins. So together with side A and side B is around 30 mins, give or take. The second thing to point out is that the record comes in a blank jacket. Which is orange by the way with a black and red label listing what is on the record. Its cool cause at the bottom it says, Caution: Known to cause riots. The record itself is on red vinyl with a white label. I was wanting the full album and got a single but its cool. I only paid a few bucks for it. By the way its the first vinyl record ive ever bought and owned."
1,Do Not Buy,This is a terrible iron. Do not buy it. It blows water out of the bottom two holes. It is so bad that the iron is sitting in a pool of water shortly after starting to use it. It soaks the clothes you are trying to press. I have used almost everyday for several weeks and it does not get better. I'm going to try and get my money back and buy a different iron.
2,Shattered......,"Awoke this morning and found my lid was shattered.All of our Swiss Diamond items are hand washed in hot, soapy water, rinsed in hot water, hand dried, and put away. The hand treatment on the Swiss Diamond products is to prolong the surface life.This particular lid rests on it's edge in a cabinet, over to the right side, and the cabinet is lined with the rubber mesh cabinet liner material.This lid was found shattered, beginning in the center, with crack lines radially outward. The edge glass was all intact, though cracked.This glass is apparently tempered, as all the glass pieces were roughly rectangular in shape.It's too bad that Swiss Diamond doesn't warranty lids, as I'd surely get this one replaced under warranty. As it stands, I'll have to purchase a new one, and, as the name of this product states, ""Replacement ... Cover"".. so plan on replacing it at some point..."
2,"works good for a while, but it's not all that great","This juicer does a good job at juicing but leaves a lot to be desired. The opening isn't wide enough and you have you cut up everything to fit, then it doesn't juice everything and huge chunks get wasted. The blade is hard to clean and the pulp holding area is not very big so you have to stop in between if you are doing a large batch of something. After a while the unit becomes VERY difficult to open and close. I recently broke both of the bones in my arm, and now with my weaker arm strength I cannot use this juicer anymore. It's good for muscle men, but for people with injuries, women, or elderly people I would not recommend this juicer, get one that is more user friendly."
5,Good juicer.,"My wife has been using this for about 3 months and it's working great.As the previous review said, cleanup is simple, but you need to get a larger brush for the cutter (I picked up a cheap dish brush at WalMart that works fine). It's loud, but it isn't as if you're running it all the time, so it isn't that much of a problem. Still, if you're in an apartment with thin walls, you may want to consider some other unit.I'm slightly concerned about the lifetime of the cutter unit, which looks a little lightweight. But no problems with it so far."
1,Disappointed,"We've had two of these and they both failed. The locking mechanism is made of plastic and breaks off. I used it lightly--maybe once every couple weeks at the most. Waring did replace the broken piece once (i paid shipping) but it failed again in the same place, so I'm done."
1,a waste of juice,The juicer does the job but wastes so much fruit and veggie juice. After juicing when I open the top I can squeeze the leftover pulp and there is sooo much juice in it still that didnt even get into the cup. Also large chunks of carrots and celery dont even get juiced you can see them in the pulp. This is not a good veggie juicer it seems to do better with citrus fruits. The top feeder is small so you have to cut all fruits into small pieces. Its alot of work to use this juicer!!! Also the inside blade is hard to clean and there are always chunks left on it no matter how long or how hard I scrub it. Please Try a different juicer... You get what you pay for in this case!!
3,GREAT VALUE - But not a great juicer,"LOTS to like - but not love - about this juicer.- VERY durable... good build quality.- EASY to clean...- Doesn't take up a lot of real estate because it's self-contained (no external pulp bin.)All of this is trumped by one relatively serious flaw: IT DOES NOT DO A ""100%"" JOB OF EXTRACTING THE JUICE. The best juicers on the market produce a comparatively ""dry"" pulp. In other words, the juice is more juicy! But those juicers cost two-to-five times as much money.From a PRICE or VALUE standpoint, you CANNOT find a better juicer!"
3,Review of the Waring Juicer,I was a little disappointed with the product. You can't juice 32oz in one shot you have to empty out the pulp a couple of times. Also I found that the juice collected at the bottom of the pulp rather than falling out the spout. I also had 2 large pieces of celery and carrot left after juicing my first time. I realized that in total I spent around $70 and so for that amount of money I figured I would return it and get the $90 juicer that my cousin has and I know that you can wait to empty it when 32oz is done.
2,it's ok,I'm a little disappointed. I read alot of reviews and people seemed very happy with this juicer but I think it wastes alot of the fruit. Even blackberries that should be pulverized leave good size peices behind and it's not that easy to clean. But I quess for the money it's as good as you get.
5,Very Easy to Use and Very Easy to Clean,"This is my first ever Juicer. I like it. It's easy to use and very easy to clean. It comes appart easilly and after a quick rinse in the sink it goes right into the dishwasher where it cleans up quickly for the next use. Putting it back together is easy as well. It also looks nice on my counter top when waiting for it's next use. So far I have experimented with Honey Dew mellons, Pine Apples and Kiwis. The juice is good, not overly sweet like store bought juices. Also I have learned that Pine Apple/Honey Dew juice goes great with Vodka. My friends are loving it."
4,Juice extractor for the fit,"We got this juice extractor through our wedding registry.We are very happy with it, we agree with the reviews of previous costumers, though if a child sleeps while you juice, that has to do with good sleep...However, when you push the fruits and vegetables into the feed tube, the pusher creates a vacuum, which makes it hard to pull the pusher back out. This means you end up doing quite some some excercise to juice... This makes it a little less effortless to juice...."
1,Noisy,"Well it's at a very low price which is good but is offset by it's negative points. After using it for a couple of times I no longer want to use it because of noise and also because it wastes some juice. So that means I bought something I can't use, -1 for me."
1,"Dangerous, Poisonous. Amazon to please delist this hazardous product.","This Juicer has a top cover that is cast in flexible plastic. It's so poorly designed that the plastic is far to flexible and touches the spinning blade when you press down on the vegetable with any force at all. The pieces of shredded plastic end up ""somewhere"".The juicer has that characteristic smell of melted plastic when left out of use for too long -- this is extremely unhealthy. Consult one of the recent popular documentaries about the effects of plastic poisening on people's health.The plunging hole is very small. You'll often find yourself having to slice a vegetable down the middle to get it to fit in.Vegetables easily get stuck in the hole. Then you have to press down hard -- and get shredding plastic again.My experience is only with the typical things one would juice: carrots, apple slices, celery sticks. So I am not trying to juice anything exotic w.r.t. my comments.This juicer should not be in production."
5,"Love it, it's fantastic.","I really enjoy this juicer. It's the first one I've ever bought. It's pretty quiet, does a good job, and the price is fantastic. Really happy with how well it works for the price!"
5,Great product!,This juice extractor works well for the price! Easy to use and clean! I would recommend this product to a friend.
2,Beware - pulp very wet / smell of burning wires after 2 weeks of use,"After using this juicer for 2 week, for 3 days in a row, there was a smell of burning wires - no smoke. The juicer is still working fine, and the smell has since stopped. It makes me wonder just how long the motor will last. I never over load it, and actually go slow to try and extract as much juice as possible. The pulp is very wet, so I know I am loosing alot of good juice. The design is very good, but the strainer is a little small, as you can really only get one cup of juice before needing to clean. Cleanup is simple. That is what I was looking for. I would recommend something different, if you want more juice out of your fruits and veggies."
1,Not functional,After couple of months it stopped working. I never gave it to much use. It seems to be an electronic problem because it does not even runs.
4,This is a great juicer,"This is my first juicer. After quite a bit of research, I decided to go with this one. I've been using this juicer for about a month, and I am very pleased with it. I agree with one comment on using a toothbrush instead of the the brush they give you. It cleans the filter, and especially the teeth on the blade very well. It does leak out of the seam at the top a little, but I notice this happens when I am juicing cucumbers, bell peppers, or fruits with high liquid content. It doesn't leak when I juice carrots, spinach, ginger, and other things. Not a big deal. Overall, a great product. I use it almost every day. Very easy clean up. Looks great too. Definitely worth the price guys!"
2,Lots of waste,"This juicer is ok, but about half of whatever goes through it ends up still whole in the waste compartment. Not a lot of juice, but lots of waste, even if you cut things up really well first."
5,Juicer,"I promptly received the product within a few days. It was exactly what I expected and in great condition. It juices effectively, doesn't make too much noise and is easy to clean. Thank you."
3,A little advisory,"I agree with the prior reviewer's assessment of the artwork - upscale graphic novel is appropriate. However, I differ with his opinion that this would appeal to both sexes. There are several female figures nude from the waist up and, unlike the Rider-Waite decks, the breasts are drawn in a nearly pornographic manner. There are also attractive men, but none of them are exposed in this way.A large number of tarot decks feature nude figures in a more innocent, we-are-all-members-of-humankind fashion. The Robin Wood deck, for instance, features both male and female nudity, but not like some of the women are portrayed in the Avalon deck. I wish I had known this deck contained these images before ordering, as I will likely not use it."
5,It serves the concept well.,"This compilation stays true to the Buddha Bar music concept. In fact, it is the most consistent compilation in terms of tempo flow since the release of the 5th volume. As always, it is divided in two CDs called Paris and New York. The Paris CD is more loungy, perfect for a quiet dinner with friends or to vegetate quietly in a sofa. The New York CD is more upbeat and contains an incredible collection of good track from unknown artitst (not including Schiller).Overall, I think this is money well spent!"
4,Vol. VIII: great asian sounds...,"I have all eight Buddha Bar albums with Vols. III and VI being my favorites so far. Now as I listen to Vol. VIII now for the second time, I must say... it's a good one! esp. ""Disc 2 - New York."" The sound is mostly South Asian-based and that makes for a very consistent listening experience. Although I liked discovering new world artists by listening to the previous Buddha Bars, I find some of their CDs rather disjointed because of the wide range of musical cultures represented. But not this one..."
2,disappointed x 2,The product number on the website was for a different goal.The large goal that was described on the website had the product number of a 5 foot goal.Contacted Amazon twice and the wrong goal was shipped both times.
5,Wonderful historical romance,"I can't give a book a mediocre review because of a few typos or errors in the kindle conversion process. It would have been nice if someone had proofread the kindle version, but still a wonderful book. The story centers around the labor unrest of the times and ultimate formation of labor unions. In the midst of all this is a lovely story of a young girl raised by a ""gypsy"" of sorts. It is a very compelling story, well written and with gripping characters. I couldn't put it down and read it in one day. Highly recommend it."
3,High Hopes,I had high hopes for this book when I read the author's bio but was disappointed in all the typos in it. I don't know how many of the typos were caused from converting from one format to another on the author's side but it made for a difficult read. I couldn't understand why she kept saying that the main character had perfect diction and then would have her use some slang. The dialogue is difficult to read because the author is trying to make it more like the way the characters talk. The story is interesting if you can get past all that.
4,What a great CD!,"I fell in love with this cd from the first track. I especially love ""Baby Hugh Hef"". The production on this album is extremely tight, and while the lyrics aren't the strong point, they aren't supposed to be. The entire package is dope."
1,cant listen to 1 song straight through,what is this?this is so horrible when i listen to it i think i must be stoned and it completely confuses you and its the worst CD mix what is it? is it some low budget rap wannabe with synthesized heavy metal in the background? The producer even nows how bad he be makin it cuz he be blastin a crappy beat for the first 25 seconds of every song because hes too scared to just rap
2,Ugh.....If ya' like weed,"I love Korn and Fieldy's work on Korn, so i said ""hey why not buy this CD?"" So i did... 1) I expect PHAT beats, and i got them 2) I expect bad, yet decent lyrics that AT LEAST u can listen too...I got worse A LOT WORSE than i expect. Besides being the worse lyricist i've heard in a while, all Fieldy's talks about is WEED, thats IT!!! Come on man i expect better!!!"
5,Excellent!!,I have one of NYC use it all the time. Will be going to Ireland in the Fall and know this will come in handy. Have already mapped out a few places we plan to vist.
2,Very up and down,"I have had a very strange experience feeding my kitten Merrick food. The first time I gave it to her, she loved it and ate it all up. I was so happy I had found something that looked and smelt good and went ahead and ordered a case of 24. Much to my dismay, after 2 days of eating this food, she gets a stomach upset. I switched her back (over a period of days) to her old food, then back to Merrick again, and the same thing happened. Soft stools, tummy upset etc etc. I cannot feed her this stuff anymore. Now I am stuck with 20 odd cans of Merrick."
4,Work with what you got and drop the baggage.,"Season 2's look at La Gondola was fairly enjoyable, because it shows a lot of bad practices in the restaurant business without placing much importance on changing the restaurant itself. The menu was not simplified nearly as much as other restaurants in the series. Also, I liked the end result. The piano was a nice touch."
1,Not even worth one star,"OK, first off whoever reviewed this and gave it 5 stars is either insanely rich and naive or work for the company that produces this blatant rip-off? I mean $800.00 for a freakin' mini-garden shed plus a couple parts that you can pick up for about $150.00 anywhere else. Absolutely brilliant example of the ""people will buy anything if you put the right spin on it"". Well the only spin on this is that it is a rip. If you have $800.00 to spend on a box for your generator go get one of the good quality vented exterior metal boxes that are 1000 times safer, possibly cheaper and will last 1000 times longer. Or for fun, you can buy this one, let your generator run all night and watch the box melt and burst into flames! XD"
1,In reality... the music is NOT so beautiful,"This cd really isn't as great as all the reviewers rave on about. For one thing the melody lines Clark plays are dull, and uninteresting, and they may be ""beautiful"", but a sort of centerfold beauty, might be nice to look at, but there's nothing going on inside(no iner beauty). Very superficial, easy listening music, at best. Life is too short to waste 45 minutes of it listening to something so mundane..."
5,ptphd,"sit back... feel the passion... this is not just piano... this is the soul embracing the essence of sound, the fingers enticing the depths of emotion, an artist of pureness and intense devotion to the music expressed through the heart. BRAVO"
3,Fits the 2013 Hyundai Elantra,"At the time of purchase, the product description says it fits a 2012 Hyundai Elantra. I have a 2013 model and decided to take a chance that Hyundai did not make any changes to the wheels.The wheel locks look too different from the standard wheel bolts, so they are sort of conspicuous. The design of the key makes it difficult to apply enough torque when tightening the wheel locks. I am still wary of earlier comments from other users that the multiple wheel locks they received shared the same key."
2,Sticking out.,These locks are too long! They stick out. I wish they made these locks in the same length as the regular lugnuts.
3,"Sander good, paper too expensive and hard to find","This is a useful and well-made sander, but it only uses Black and Decker paper that costs [a lot of money] for 5 sheets (if you can even find the paper - it is here on Amazon.com, but usually is hard to find at a hardware store), making it too expensive to use a lot. Orbital sanders with standard size disks or palm sanders that use 1/4 sheets of regular sandpaper are much more economical - about one tenth the cost. It has performed well the times I used it, but I almost never use it due to the expensive paper (that lasts no longer than other paper - you will use up several sheets on a small project)."
4,Good book,"This book was kind of hard to find, but thankfully the price wasn't too bad. The book came exactly as described which was wonderful. Now I can get some more ideas for my afghans."
2,Dry and Pedantic,"I was amazed at how little my interest in Beethoven's life translated into any attachment to this book. I've been reading it off and on for over a year, during which I've zipped through other more engaging books. I keep going back to Beethoven in the hopes that it will take off but it never does. It reads much more academically than it has to - I've encountered much greater depth in far more accessible styles of writing. Although the book is fairly recent, it reads as if it were written in the early 20th century. While there are interesting facts presented, the weight of the narrative style demands far greater effort than the rewards of putting up with it give you in the end."
2,Reprint,"I have read ""How to Simply Cut Hair"", and from the Table of Contents and Excerpt viewable on Amazon.com, ""How to Simply Cut Hair Even Better"" looks like an exact reprint of the first book. If you have one you don't need the other."
5,Excellent,I bought this a few years ago. Have read & used others but keep going back to the basics in this book.Experiment. And enjoy.
2,Very disappointing,"I bought this books several years ago and for some reason just got around to reading it. The spells were very simplistic and the affirmation were wordy. I found the formatting annoying. When I tried to perform one or two of the spells, I found that I concentrated more on reading the text then the ritual. The layout of the spells should have been conducive to having the book open if that is what the author recommends.If you are curious buy used."
4,Tarot and Spellcasting? Of Course!,"I admit when Tarot Spells first appeared, I was skeptical; can something like this work? Does it work? My experiences with the knowledge within show that you don't have to have an understanding of Tarot Cards or even how to read them;Simply look up a spell or a problem, do the simple layouts and visualizations, believe they work---- and they will."
4,Wow,"I just got this CD yesterday and am still listening and absorbing, but it has to be said that the bonus CD is truly remarkable, while the Haendel/Ashkenazy coupling in Szymanovsi's ""Mythes"" is stunning...very heroic and convincing music making done by both artists."
4,A Good Read,"The Queen of Everything is an interesting book. I didn't find it spectacular, but it wasn't bad at all. The idea behind the plot is certainly an original one, and I liked Jordan's honest commentary of the things around her. The way she described Laylani, her mother, the people coming to Parrish Island, Big Mama and every aspect of her life was great. I didn't mind when she went off on a tangent telling another story, especially if it was about fiesty Grandpa Eugene."
3,boring and slow,i started reading this book and i found it very....SLOW!!! it doesn't really get to the point but talks about all this other nonsense. I feel this book was not good and I feel teenagers would not enjoy it. I agree with other reviews i have read it and it doesn't grab you at all.
3,compatibility problem,i've had this card for a while and have only recently encountered problems with it. i recently purchased a rca lyra rd1072 mp3 player with a sd expansion slot. while playing mp3's on the pqi sd card in the rca lyra the songs skip. i tried a sd card from another manufacturer in my rca lyra and had no problems. i also tried my pqi sd card in a different mp3 player and had no skipping problem.
1,Junk,this is a terrible book. i was wanting to learn how to use the things that nature provides to build things such as wigwams tepee etc... and not have to rely on having a home depot around. if u want to know how to live of the land then dont buy this book
3,"Well made, but slow","I didn't get to finish watching the movie as it's so slow in its plot, like most films back then were. I love classic movies, and really interested in this because I'm from Burma. And given that it's a film made by non-Burmese set in Burma, it's relatively somewhat realistic although of course, with some creative licenses here and there. My parents did watch it to the end and they loved it. I guess they have more patience than I do. The quality of the DVD is very good."
2,burmesian harp,"The service was ok, but the DVD doesn't work in Germany ... (there was no information about this)"
2,Blackjack card shoe,Upon my first use of the product the sliding mechanism in the shoe broke. The metal roller in the bottom gave way from the plastic housing. The product's aesthetics were good but this is irrelevent if the product does not work.
2,Poor Quality,The plastic piece at the front is simply glued on and the glue didn't hold for long. After a few times of using this shoe it broke off.
3,Okay results-not fantastic,"I wear my hair in microbraids for an extended amount of time. With that being said, after i take my extensions, i have massive nearly impossible knots that just dont want to come out without a fight. I found that this detangler worked okay with those knots. If i left it for a few mintues the knot would definently loosen up for me. However i would still need to really get in there to get the knot out. Overall the product is definently worth the money and i will defiently continue to purchase it cuz its a better detangler than the rest lol"
2,it was ok,"I thought this hair detangler would have made detangling my hair a much easier process, but it did not. I honestly did not see or feel much of any difference in using this spray in my hair after applying it to my damp hair. My hair texture is slightly curly and detangling it after I shower has always been a bit of a hassle, so it just might be my hair and not the general case for everyone else."
4,Necessary for exam but needs improvement,"Everyone who takes the P.E. exam has this book at their side during the test, but be warned that it's full of typos. Be sure to check the errata sheet so you can correct the errors. Also, the binding is very poor quality for the price. After two months of light use my appendices are falling out."
5,Very Useful In Passing the Exam,I bought it four weeks before I sit in the exam. I studied it every for at least 4 hours in weekday and at least 8 hours in the weekends. And I have passed the PE!Highly recommend!
1,AMAZON CREDIT DISCOUNT A TRICK DON'T DO IT,"The advertisement for a $30 credit is deceiving, don't fall for it."
2,Not really all that soft.,I was looking for a great cushiony sock with out paying way too much and for what I got at this price was disappointing. Who makes great socks these days -so that everytime you wear them it feels like you have bought a new pair shoes? I won't try this brand again.
3,If Not For the Battery...,"Really not a bad little saw. Keep in mind, it is not corded and it is not for the contractor. After you get past that, the quick blade change is above average and the saw is unusually light weight for recirpocating saws (compare to a Porter Cable corded). It does eat the 14.4V batteries for lunch, I found it lasts for about 10-15 minutes of heavy duty work. With the six hour recharge, you need several batteries on hand. Still, it is reasonably priced and complements my Firestorm 14.4 collection well. Overall I have been satisfied."
4,Summer Music,"Summer 2001 has arrived, and Shades of Brown is the music to accompany it. If you like Ozomatli, this will be the next record you buy. There are differences between the two, though. This one is less pure latin, less hip-hop, but more funk, jazz and ... pop! A fine mixture, not complex.... Regarding the texts, I agree with the second reviewer. If you don't hear the lines of the chorus of the title track, it's a shame. And 'Spill the Wine', for example, is pretty funny, without any 'political' contents. By the way: what does Mocosos mean?"
2,Embarassing,"Alright, I will concede that the music on this album is at times sound, which saves it from a one star rating. These guys are capable musicians, and the tunes them selves are decent, not overly inspired, but not bad.The lyrics, though, are terrible. Probably the worst I've heard on any record in a long, long time. And they're even worse when the band attempts to be political (""The Border""), which come off as immature and lacking in insight. The problem is, these guys think they're being profound, when in fact thay're embarassing themselves.If you want Latin fusion, check out Ozomatli, Los Super Seven and, of course, Los Lobos. Steer clear of this clunker."

3,Terrible recording quality!!!,"Before buying this CD when I looked at the band list I thought this HAD to be one of the best comps ever made. And yes it certainly would have been one of the best comps ever made if it wasn't for a certain factor. RECORDING QUALITY! The recording to this CD is beyond garage style recording. It's BAD garage style recording. Side One Dummy Records is making all of these great bands look like total $hi+ and making a buck while doing it! If you love punk rock and don't mind AWFUL recording then by all means buy this. You would probably give it 5 stars in fact! However, if you aren't and you buy it, don't say I didn't warn you."
