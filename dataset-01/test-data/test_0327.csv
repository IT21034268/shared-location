4,Durable,This bag has held up to years of daily use with just minimal fraying. Bought it off Amazon for a third of what other places were charging. The only drawback is that it has just one zip up pouch in addition to the main holding area. Would have liked a few more smaller pockets.
1,ALERT -- BIG ERRORS in the posted reviews,"The posted reviews are *not* about ""Fine Reader OCR"", they are aboout the ""Lingvo"" dictionary......"
5,Excellent,"I became interested in purchasing this CD when the song ""Danse Mon Esmeralda"" was performed by an Ice Dance French couple at the exhibitions of the 2000 World Figure Skating Championships. I do not speak any French, but I want to learn. This soundtrack of the Notre Dame de Paris is awesome. There's not one single song that I would say I didn't like. All the songs are wonderful and I can't count the times I've listened to this CD since I purchased it. The music crosses the language barrier. I recommend this CD to anyone who reads this review."
5,Amazing,Althougth the alblum is in french the actors and actresses sing the songs with such passion and emotion it amazes you. Noa's portrayal of the Gypsy Girl Esmeralda is amazing. Her songs are filled with emotion. She knows exactly what emotions to use. During Bohemienne she's singing happily and seductively but in Vivre which is one of the songs near to when she's going to be killed u can hera the fear in her voice. The same goes for all the actors and actresses in the show. Luck Mervil and Garou are amazing. If your considering getting any Notre Dame De Paris soundtrack get this one or the live French Alblum!
5,A GEM OF A MUSICAL,"Notre Dame de Paris just received its English premiere in Las Vegas and hopefully it will be bound for Broadway in the near future. The Live Parisian Cast Recording of this show is INCREDIBLE. The lyrics (in French) are beautiful to listen to. This show is especially moving because all of the common chorus members become the ""sans-papiers"" --those without papers. Every word of this show has great meaning and power. The music is equally as expressive. Notre Dame is a musical for a new generation of theatre-goers. It is modern, the music is everything you could wish for from a rock/pop musical. The first time that I heard this show, I was blown away by all of the performances. The first entrance of Esmerelda is so hauntingly beautiful (""Bohémienne"")...this is a show you can easily get lost in forever, and it's not a bad place to be."
2,Not much for 20+ bucks,"Perhaps I didnt read carefully before purchasing this OL a couple wks ago.Besides the fact there are only 4 episodes divided into 2 discs & only photo gallery of each episode for extras, these episodes are edited to 30 min each.From what I remember & Donny says in the 1st season episode ""We have a whole hour."" The complete opening credits (animated sequence), ""It takes Two"" segments, solos & music videos w/flower or seagull introduction, & more comedy sketches, are all missing.I don't know why it had to cost the same as purchasing a 20-30 episode of a tv season from any series & why each episode edited & chopped in half couldnt have just been put onto 1 disc.But because I haven't seen an episode for over 30 yrs (while in prime time) that's why i hastily purchased this."
3,they just dont last,"they were fine for the first 6 months , we followed directions but the non stick surface really does not last.. you really have to baby these.. I wouldn't recommend them..."
1,Cuisinart cookware- not worth the money!!!!!,"Have owned for several years. My 1st full set of matchig cookware! Very, very disappointed with this cookware, considering the cost!!!!! Finish wears off & food begins to stick, like any regular cheap cookware. Only problem is, I can't bring myself to throw it out after spending that uch money! If I'd bought something cheap & a-la-carte, like I'd done my whole life, I'd feel much better. Absolutely NOT worth the money!!!! WAY OVER-RATED!!! And Cuisinarts Warranty isn't worth the paper it's written on!!"
1,Got wrong region DVD!,"Well, can't really say if this is good or bad as they shipped DVD for the WRONG REGION. Product description on this page says Region 1 (USA, where I live).The DVD we got though says Region 2/3/4/5/6, and wont play on my DVD players as a result.Don't know if this was a fluke or if Amazon's inventory is messed up.Replacement will be here in a week - maybe they'll get it right this time.(I've ordered lots of stuff from Amazon, and never had a problem - stuff happens!)UPDATE 8/4/2010 -Replacement DVD came in, wrong region AGAIN.DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE IN USA!!! Product description on Amazon says REGION 1 BUT THEY ARE SHIPPING REGION 2/3/4/5/6!!WHAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY SHIPPING REQUIRES EUROPEAN DVD PLAYER!!!!Very disappointed.Update 8/13/2010I called Amazon back on the 5th or so, and they pulled this item from the site to check inventory, and now it's back up. So maybe they fixed it... but refund process is painless anyway if not."
5,AMAZING SIMPLE PLAN AT THEIR BEST,its amazing and if you have any questions or disagree email me at confuzzled_vex@hotmail.com
5,For all Simple Plan fans:,"There are a lot of music DVD's out there that are half-assed. There aren't a whole lot of extra stuff to be seen, and fans think, ""What the hell? I spent my money on THIS crap?"" Quite the contrary with ""A Big Package For You."" There are so many funny moments and cool extra footage that this is definitely worth the money that you spend on it. A must-have for all Simple Plan fans. Hell, even if you AREN'T a fan of theirs, get it anyway. It's funny as hell."
2,Disappointed,I saw this on Dr. Oz for pain. Dr. Oz was raving about its pain relief. I've tried it four or five times on my tennis/golf elbows. It did nothing to relief the pain. I don't recommend spending your money on this product.
1,System Specs,"The only thing that this product said you needed is a windows or mac platform. It did NOT specify which VERSION of windows you must use. IT DOES NOT WORK ON MY COMPUTER. My computer is apparently too GOOD to run this game. It also stated that you would get free expedited shipping... it did NOT. It's the seller's fault honestly. I remember this game from when I was younger, and it's a great game. Unfortunately, I cannot PLAY it, AND I had to pay for the shipping when it was supposed to be free. Don't order from booksbylenyb, TERRIBLE SELLER."
5,A Small View of London at Large,"This is a beautiful work of art for anyone who loves to look outside the well known sites of London, although that is there as well. I thorougly enjoy picking it up and having a read about the various sections and looking at the illustrations that will remind you of your time there or desire to go. The layout and illustrations brings to mind what a Grand Tour participant would have created upon visiting a new city.Wonderful, just wonderful."
1,Gelatin,If you eat Kosher or Halal this is a bad buy! I think the ingredients should be put in the description!
5,Wonderfully entertaining!,"This entertaining novel keeps you guessing until the very end! Witty and intriguing, the pace never lets down!!"
1,Terrible,"My book was lost in the mail(so they said so), which was not the sellers fault. But then when I would email them they would not get back to me right away. I was not very happy with them. Then finally after they sent me a new book, the day it came two books came, so I really wonder if it ever ""got lost in the mail"" or if they just never sent it. I was not happy because my class had already started and I needed this book."
4,Brain Gym book,I had this book years ago and lost it. I was happy to find it again. It's a great book.
5,Works perfectly,"Although I was skeptical that this ""highway safety cone"" looking device would support my trailer tongue, it turns out that it works like a charm. No more wood or concrete blocks. This was a great purchase!"
4,"A ""must have"" for the trailer","I used one of these for years then, sadly, left it at a campsite. It took me awhile to locate a replacement, but this one from Amazon fills the bill nicely. Some people have said on here that they find it weak, and it collapses after a few uses. My trailer has 1000# of tongue weight and I have found this stand to be strong and sturdy---I can only say that they must be misusing it in some way .."
1,trailer tongue jack stand,"I have used this stand and can not recommend it. The flange at the top broke off so there is nothing to keep the jack from sliding off. The trailer was only 19 feet long, so it wasn't too heavy."
1,Waste of money,"This was a completely useless purchase. The plastic is of a very low quality, you can rip it very easily. You would be lucky to get one use out of it."
2,slow movie,"This movie was not as interesting as I thought it would be, I was a little disappointed, but it was watchable.Wasn't at all what I thought it would be."
5,cheap and good,"Superose is as sweet as any of the higher priced one's, but it just as good. The free shipping is also a plus."
2,not worth buying or using,"By the time my child was able to manage the writing involved, she was far beyond the concepts taught. While we enjoyed a few of the first lessons, the end of the book makes very heavy weather of what should be simple, intuitive grammar. Any child who reads will pick up on the basics being taught here -- the difference between a question and a statement, paragraphing, what a noun is, etc, without needing to be taught the specific terminology. Later, when more formal grammar is taught, these concepts will be second nature. However, if you have a young (5 - 7) yr. old child who enjoys doing lots of writing, this might be very enjoyable."
5,Gift,I bought this item as a gift for my nephews. They really enjoys the videos. This was a great purchase.
1,I hate this DVD,"Don't waste your money on this DVD, it is not any good. The graphics look like someone made them on their home computer and they are very distracting. If you would like to purchase an excellent educational DVD for your toddler, I highly recommend Letter Factory by Leap Frog."
4,Integrates diabetes into a vairety of lifestyles,"The authors address both the medical and the emotional aspects of diabetes. There is relatively more on the medical and dietary aspects of diabetes than on the emotional side.I particularly liked the fact that they discuss diabetes regimens for individuals who can only manage intermediate or loose control. Tight control can be dangerous for individual who are unable to maintain a diet or test themselves frequently.I was a little surprised at what they consider intensive control. They say that such individuals typically test themselves 2-4 times per day. (1-2 for Type II diabetes) Personally, I would never be able to safely maintain my level of control with only with so few tests per day.A few of the suggestions in this book, such as prescription dietary aids, are out of date. Still, this is an excellent overall guide to having a balanced life while living with diabetes.Carol Watkins, M.D."
2,A Sketch - Not a History,"I assume that this book receives some praise only because of a lack of modern histories on Edward III. Unfortunately, the book is totally inadequate to its task - barely scratching the surface of Edward and the impact of activity in both England and France. Its complete lack of primary sources from France (except Frossiart so one should say reliable sources) and the lowlands is startling in a text that claims to study Edward III. It is excessively anglophobic in its view of Edward's reign and so cannot help but present a skewed and incomplete picture. Its organization makes the presentation even worse - by considering each estate separately, it makes a tricky history because of the time scale even more disjointed and trivial in scope and coverage. I could go on about the flaws and inaccuracies (such as lack of consideration of low land promised subsidies, etc.), but will not."
2,Possibly 1 mm too wide,"I just hammered the hell out of this thing to get it to fit inside the filter basket. With about 1/8th of an inch left, I have given up. My basket now looks like a mangled piece of art. I have the ECM150 model, which this basket supposedly fits. Trust me -- it doesn't.I didn't want to go all the way down to one star as this obviously fits other models (as per other reviews). If you are purchasing this for your beloved ECM150, I wish you good luck -- go buy a hammer and a vice."
2,If you prefer books over the Internet.,"Some people don't enjoy reading a computer screen. If that's you, then you'll appreciate the book."
2,questionable origin of book,"Book received is a former (I hope that is the case) library book from Sun Prairie Public Library stamped ""For Reference, Do Not Take From This Room"". Would like some reassurance that this book was purchased from the library."
5,"not what i expected, but definitly better.","I never read anything by Mavis Cheek, but I saw this and thought, ""what a cute little summer read this ought to be."" This book is alot more that just a May/December romance... it's a story about a woman who is emotionally, sexually and morally conflicted, which I believe all persons can relate to at some point in their lives. It's not just about an affair, it's also about sibling rivalry that can be so cruel it can manifest itself into adulthood realtionships and decisions. Dilys, the main character, really learned an enormous amount about herself and the people that are most important in her life, which often, gets completely overlooked due to the trials of everyday living."
1,wasted money,"This book was a completely waste of money. I read the Italian edition, but also the title of the English edition is misleading. First of all, the book is not about an aunt. The aunt is the excuse a rich & wealthy woman uses to meet her secret lover. A certain point an aunt is introduced, and she explain the ruined life of the family, but it is 1 chapter only, and the family history does not really compare to the main character's (Dylis).I'd like to get my money back, but I know it is not possible. Really a waste of money."
2,Modern Art,"This book is very much geared towards modern art. While the materials listing is comprehensive (i.e. defining the materials that you might use to embroider), and the how-to diagrams seem to be good (I already knew how to embroider, so I didn't need help there), this book is completely geared to modern-art creations. Which didn't help me at all, seeing how I do medieval bead embroidery. I think there was one picture of a Victorian embroidery and that was it.Also, it didn't have patterns to follow. It's pretty much nothing more than a modern-art idea book."
4,beethoven meets stokoski,"Stokowski's interpretation of Beethovens 9th symphony has many fine moments and is a worthy addition to any Beethoven collection . The recording quality is not as rich as Von Karajan's version but still very good.If a listener could make a patchwork quilt of the best movements from various versions it might approach perfection ,for them! However this should satisfy most expectations very nicely"
3,WTF...,"Yeah, its got good growls and some decent guitar. But it just seems like the singer and the band are on two diff. ideas. band - let's play as fast as we can. singer - I'm just going to growl some stuff.I had to listen to this album 4 times before I could put a ""yeah its pretty good"" sticker on it.And HOW do u load the enhanced part of this cd? I can't figure it out."
4,Good Basic Siphon Gun,"Draws media well, especially with shortened hose. Reasonably comfortable grip and trigger. Metal threaded tip (chrome end piece in photo) fits fairly poorly with gun body -- it doesn't leak air, but the threads scrape loudly. Problem was cured with a stiff steel brush. Gun disassembles well -- metal tip, ceramic tip and o-ring, and front assembly all come apart easily. Didn't take the trigger apart. I wouldn't want to strip the paint from a car with this setup, but for smaller items (exhaust manifold, small steel pieces) it works very well."
5,One of the best artists out there,North American music has been so horrible recentley that I have been happily converted to Latin music. My favorite artists are Cristian and Alejandro Sanz. Cristian's voice is so beautiful and soothing that I listen to this album day and night.
2,Que Chasco,"""Amar Es"" difinitivamente no este disco. Tener que escuchar todo el disco es un trauma agonisante y psicopata. No hay nada bueno en este disco. La única canción buen es el primer corte, ""No hace falta"", pero no salva al disco. Es un material de pobre calidad encuanto a la música y talento.:( :( :( : ( :( : ("
3,Just Okay,"I think Sinatra's voice was excellent during the decade of the 60's. It could be powerful, and it could be soft (as in the Jobim recordings). So it stands to reason that his voice is excellent in this 1960's television special.I particularly like his rendition of ""Cycles"" on this DVD. With his beautiful voice, and the equally beautiful orchestra behind him, he conveys a mood that another singer would have a hard time duplicating. I've heard it said that Sinatra sang a song for every mood. The performance of this song confirms that to me. His renditions of ""Nice 'N' Easy,"" and ""How Little We Know"" are equally beautiful.I enjoyed The Fifth Dimension and Diahann Carroll. Is this my favorite Sinatra DVD? No. That honor goes to the Sinatra DVD which has Ella Fitzgerald and Antonio Carlos Jobim on it. That show was the best! However, this one is worth watching."
1,Terrible Ink Save your money,"I purchased thinking it was the same as HP Ink and it dried out after just a few printings it dried out I tried to get so answers and no one got back to me, it was a big waste of money!"
1,It's not erotic and not funny then what is it .... try dumb,"I can not believe that I wasted my money on a movie whose basic premise is not sex & zen, but rather, a ribald tale of a man getting his poorly endowed penis replaced by a horse penis.To do that, the fat slovenly, drunken fool of a doctor, even built a small guillotine and (believe it or not) a ramp for the penis to slide down, just before, (yup you guessed it)the dog scarfes it up ....As a male, watching this stuff, the pucker/shudder factor certainly raised jumped 20 degrees ....Yes the cinematography sound etc etc was excellent, the girls were OK, and, yes, the story starts and ends with zen pronouncements, from the elders, that is about the only good thing I could say ..... and, I really think thats giving this DVD much more credit than its worth....."
1,It's a Fake!!!,"When I opened it I realized I had been ripped off. The letters on the bottle were crooked and the cap looked fake. Although the scent is similar, it is definitely watered down. I have purchased at department stores and online before. There are certain websites that are cheaper than department stores that have authentic products. If it is much cheaper than the department store price, it is probably a knockoff!"
5,HEAVENLY AROMA,MY FIRST BOTTLE WAS A GIFT FROM A FRIEND. IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE FOR ME AT MACY'S. THIS IS A REAL TREAT AN JUST MY BUDGET.
5,I love it,"I ordered it for myself for Christmas, and love it. Everyone around me, including the kids, love the scent too. It is a pleasant, clean, and flowery smell which is not too overwelming."
3,Pedometers,"Good buy for the price. If you're looking for quantity over quality, this is the way to go. Good for promotions, give-aways, etc..."
1,Pedometer is totally in accurate,"The ""Step count"" is totally out of whack & inaccurate - all i have is an extra watch! - if I was not this lazy & did not have health problem - Iwould have definitely returned the junk.Extremely dissatisfied"
1,Does not keep accurate count of steps,"For several days I wore the watch in conjuntion with a belt-affixed pedomoter to establish the accuracy of the watch. On every occasion, the watch did not count all the steps."
2,Pedometer review,"It doesn't give accurate readings for my steps. I can walk around for 30 minutes and it says I only walked 2 steps. But, you get what you pay for. What can you expect for less than 2 bucks!"
3,extra wires,the connectors was a little loose and they had more wires than needed. there are 4 wires that are blanks on all the 94-98 jetta's instead of leaving them blank they put wires in them and call them mute wires. well installing a stereo you need room so i cut them out.
4,Nice effort from Sinead,"A quality effort from Sinead O'Connor. Maturation in style is clearly evident with her soul-searching melodies. Overall, a very good record."
2,Sinead disappointment,"I thought I would really like this release, maybe to be a little inspired by its contents. Neither happened. I played it twice, then never again."
2,Disappointing,"This is a real disappointment. I like Sinead O'Connor's voice very much. Her track on ""Tears of Stone"" with the Chieftans is one of my favorites. But there's too much ""I'm ticked off"" on this CD and not enough real vocal expression. About three of the songs work, the rest are just repetition of the same theme: People are out to get me because I'm a strong Irish woman. Sorry, I need more than that to stay interested. This CD goes straight to the garage sale."
3,Large Tricycle - Great for older or taller kids,"I just bought this tricycle for my son who will be 2 in a couple of weeks. He is almost 35 inches and several inches too short for this tricycle. I am disappointed the manufacturer advertises this bike for 2+ years, but doesn't qualify it with the child's height needed to ride the bike. While the bike is adjustable, it isn't adjustable until your child is ready for the chopper side. That means your child has to be about 36-37 inches at least to be tall enough to start using this bike. My son was so excited to have his first bicycle, but is too small to ride this one. The advertising is misleading...The bike was easy to assemble and appears to be sturdy. I would recommend it for parents of older children (or taller 2 year olds)."
4,"Good quality, but hard to find replacement blades","I have used the Saw Boss for home maintenance tasks for about the last 5-6 years. It is clearly a well made tool: it has a solid feel to it. It cuts 2x lumber at a 45 degree angle with one pass and has sufficient power. I like the fact that it is much lighter than many 7 1/4 inch circular saws. Also, the dust nozzle can direct the stream of sawdust in any direction you choose. However, if I had to do it over again I would probably buy a high-end 7 1/4 inch saw, such as a Porter Cable or a De Walt. My reason for this is the difficulty in finding 6-inch saw blades. Few places carry them."
3,If Mastodon & Botch (RIP) had a baby...,"...it's name would be The Minus Tide. Seeing that I'm from West Virginia I'm used to not seeing good acts from the state because let's face it, not much of any music scene here. I've seen what little scene we had come in go near the capital city and Huntington seeing shows at the Brickhouse, Boiler Room and HYAMP (RIP, friggin' Marshall). But in northern West Virginia in Morgantown there's something else that happens, heavier music, why it is that way I don't know, perhaps it's to due with influences of acts from Pittsburg and Eastern Ohio... Anyway, Morgantown's The Minus Tide successfully blended styles of metal and hardcore to produce Anakuklosis - a very heavy and mythological sounding record. Even though I'm sure the band's not together anymore since it was released a few years ago and all I finally bought it a few months back and liked what I heard."
2,Missing,"This CD comprises of a few great songs, however, they are missing ""Moon River"" by Henry Mancini. HBO should not be allowed to make dvd's or cd's if they are unaware of the most touching moments in their show. It may have taken Big and Carrie until the end of the show to get it together, but this song was so perfectly situated to end a season and to show the depth of feelings she had for him."
2,soundtrack without a theme song,"I buy soundtrack recordings primarily to hear the theme of the show or movie. In the case of Sex and the City, there were two variations of the Douglas Cuomo theme at the beginning and end of the show which,I don't know..I thought the producers of the cd might pick up on the fact that this is what people would like to hear. Instead we have a collection of tunes in which there are some standouts even though I haven't heard them in the show like the ballad by Trisha Yearwood and the reworking of the Gregory Issacs tune Dreams Come True. Take note producers of this cd, people buy soundtracks to hear the THEME of the show ...why else would you buy a soundtrack cd?"
4,Got what I wanted,"Unlike the other reviews, I didn't buy this Cd for the theme song to sex in the city, so really didn't care that it wasn't the real one. I bought this Cd for the Trisha Yearwood song, For Only You. She never recorded it on any of her albums and this was the only Cd I could find it on. Its the most beautiful song Ive ever heard and I am walking to it for my wedding in August of this year. The rest of the songs are upbeat and puts you in a funky mood.....For all those who are getting married, Please listen to For Only You, you will fall in love with it too."
3,Nothing special,"Great for practice, I personally dont think this head is good in Live situations, but If its the sounds you're going for by all means follow your ears."
4,Cruise Mystery Keeps You Guessing...,"In NgaioMarsh's ""Singing in the Shrouds"", dependable New Scotland Yard detective Roderick Alleyn is going on a cruise -- but not a vacation. Sent in secret to prove his hunch that a murderer is on the Cape Farewell, a cargo ship sailing to South Africa via Portugal, Alleyn meets up with an intriguing list of characters, most of whom could be legitimate subjects. All he has to go on is a scrap of paper in the last victim's hand -- an embarkation note -- and the murderer's predilection for singing and leaving a certain flower on the victim after the murder is completed. There are other clues, one of which I didn't get until the end, which point to the eventual culprit, but as always, Marsh delivers a wonderful analysis of character as well as a good plot. There's also humor and an interesting portrayal of some sexuality issues that are interesting to read in a book originally published in 1958. A good escape into a different time."
5,Kung Fu Classic,This was the film that got me interested in Kung Fu films. It was as good as I remembered and I would pit it against some of the films made in recent times.
4,Wonderful,"An adaptation of Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""Feathertop"", this play brings to life all the elements of that short-story. I performed as ""Polly"" (alias ""Rachel"" in the play) & its wonderful to see it dramatized."
2,under powered,"I bought this drill based on positive reviews I found here, and liked the idea of it being reversible. I was disappointed when it didn't have sufficient torque to drive a 5/8 auger bit through a floor joist. Went out and bought a Dewalt which had no problem. The Dewalt isn't reversible but doesn't need to be for drilling since it has enough power to drill through without getting bound or stuck. I don't know if I got a defective drill (other reviewers said they've drilled joists), or whether it's just an underpowered tool."
5,So Fun...,"I bought this for my nephew because he loves playing on the computer; however, in the process of playing on the computer, some files and programs were deleted or damaged. This computer program/game has been wonderful for him. It locks out the computer so he can have fun and his parents don't worry about the computer system messing up. :-)"
3,Solid Roots Rock with Some Complexity and Great Lyrics,"If you like bands like the now defunct Storyville, The Wallflowers, and Farmer Not So John and you like to sit back on a Saturday night and have a listen to something that won't let you tune out, then you'll like Genghis Angus. The lead vocals are great, the lyrics deserving of your attention and there's always a major chord riff around the corner to get your air guitar wound up. You could call this music alternative roots rock perhaps, I'm not sure and that's a good thing because music that's easy to classify isn't all that interesting to me. I'm still enjoying 12 Days and am looking forward to what this band will do in the next few years. Hopefully they won't follow Storyville to the CD bin marked ""great band making good music with a lot of potential that will never be fulfilled"". For all you Storyville fans looking for something else to listen to, try these guys."
2,Way too expensive for a paperback,Attractive book but not a good value. All the information is available for free on the internet where it is periodically updated and can be referenced for free without wearing out.
3,Started well but...,"I was hoping for great things having read Tale of a Dog and thoroughly enjoying it. Death of a Beekeeper showed some promise initially but never managed to deliver losing direction about a third (?) of the way in. Banalities take precidence: 'You can never truly appreciate things until you are in danger of losing them' blah, blah, blah...soap operas suffice for such insight. Otherwise, the remainder of the novel, written as fragments in the notebooks of the protagonist, resembles fragments in the notebooks for the idea of a novel by a writer who never quite puts the effort in to fully flesh them out. There are some beautiful passages but overall, the novel is aimless and not particularly coherent."
4,Very useful!,"This book is for students aiming at a band 5-6, and a good starter (when followed up with other texts) for students needing a higher score.It is a very useful IELTS-related item to purchase because:1) it presents the learner with the 4 IELTS modules (or parts)2) it can help both General and Academic Module students3) it broadens one's vocabulary by setting such activities in 16 every day situations, each of them very likely to be somehow involved in the spoken part of IELTS (hobbies, cooking, traveling, geography, weather, money, studying, fitness, cars, celebrity gossips, reading, nature, buildings, feelings, technical innovation, languages)4) it gives one actual *tips* on what to do and what not to do during the exam!5) it has lots of pictures, so it's very good for visual learners.However, this book might not be good if you are either a very conceptual person, or a very example-based one. Rules aren't described in detail, and examples are but very few."
2,"Not a quality book, be careful","Don't rush and buy this book unless you are looking for a superficial review of Inventor, the coverage is very basic, most of the material is just the online help rewritten, I've even spotted technical mistakes, even the paper is of poor quality, I totally disagree with the 5 star reviewers and I advise the author to focus and do a better job, Inventor is a great software and should not be handled so lightly."
5,african villages in modern times - what really happens,I found this book to be very very interesting! It's a great insight into how the Zimbabwean people manage to combine their traditional ways in the modern world - and the ensuing problems that arise.This is one woman's story who returns to her birth country after living in western society. Her insights into the differences (and similarities) between Africa and the West are enlightening.A fantastic read which combines reality and history!
3,cd,i wanted this CD for the song Follow Me. which i love this song the other songs are OK. the service was excellent received with in a week. can't complain about the service. Thanks
5,Thank you,I give it 5 stars.This is a quick reference book for the Struts framework.Serves as an excellent guide for the Struts framework.
3,Not as good as her watercolor book,"I had hoped this would be in the style of her ""Painting Greeting Cards in Watercolor"" book, but it isn't.While it is interesting that she compares oil vs. acrylic, she neglects to do the same for watercolor vs. acrylic. Thinned out with water, acrylic can be used just like watercolor (in transparent fashion), yet be permanent and fade-resistant. Also, whereas with watercolor you typically paint light colors first and dark colors later, with acrylic, you can just paint right over what you just painted, with no show-through. Neither advantage is mentioned in this book.I agree with a previous reviewer that for a beginner, this book does not provide very clear instruction--if you're just beginning acrylics, you'd do much better watching any Sue Scheewe show (carried on many PBS stations).This book is not bad, but not nearly as good as her watercolor book. I'm glad I bought it used."
4,Great for tanning,I bought these so I could protect my nipples while in the tanning bed and they work great. They stick very well and stay put. I have not used them under my clothes so I can't give you an opinion on that but they do stick very well.
5,Network+ Exam Cram - Coriolis Press,"I did not know, until after I finished the exam, that the passing score had been raised to 82%. I scored 88%. As usuall, exam cram was my best friend for exam preparation and review. I do feel however, that the ""cram sheet"" could have been better.Overall, this is a must-have for any person preparing to take the CompTIA Network+ exam."
2,Ok bug fllector blocks hood latch,It's ok and does what it's supposed to but it is now a major major pain to unlatch my pickup hood because this thing rides so far out from the hood edge. I had another brand before this one that was much better. So I don't recommend this one.
1,Uh-oh,"I own a lot of Makita tools and I am an ardent supporter, but I would not recommend this tool. I have been using the 9.6 volt drill for years. It's a tank. I decided to upgrade and bought this drill based on a test in Wood magazine. I had to return 2 of them due to excessive play in the shaft the chuck is attached to. I should have heeded that warning. My drill worked fine for about a year. Then I knocked it off a 4 foot step ladder. It fell about 2 feet into a pile of leaves and mulch. Honest! It broke. Something in the gear assembly gave out. I disassembled it. Couldn't find the broken part. There are a lot of plastic gears in there. Very disappointed."
2,Don't waste your money.,"The book should have been excellent. It was very accessible and easy to follow, taught concepts in a logical manner (Basics, then algebra, then various aspects of geometry, then trigonometry, etc.), and gave useful tips on problem-solving and SAT traps to avoid.However, its undoing was that apparently no one had bothered to proofread it before its publication- there were tons of errors throughout the whole thing. Many were simple calculation errors and algebraic errors that, while being incredibly annoying, were easy to spot and ignore. However, I found entire formulas that were improperly stated (leading to severe confusion on my part until I checked other sources), mis-naming of quadrants, parts of polynomial equations that randomly disappeared while the book demonstrated ""solutions"", and so many other major problems that I really think that the book did more to confuse than to help me. Until the book undergoes a major revision, I would suggest turning to another source."
3,It's kinda good.,"""Me,myself,and Irene"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in along time,so when I heard there was a soundtrack,I had to have it.So I went to costco and picked up a copy of it.It wasn't what I expected ,so I was kinda dissapointed but it still was worth the money.My favorite song is by The Offspring , entitled ""Totalimmortal"",that song is so tight,I love it. The song I don't like is by Ellis Paul,titled ""The world ain't slowin' down.""I don't know whether to recommend this cd or not,it's up to you."
2,Song name,"I'm looking for the name of the song the ""kids"" listen to in the helicopter when rescuing Hank/Charlie. Unfortunately, it's missing on the soundtrack. thx"
1,FYI,"The song with the lyric ""He wrote on the corner of the table..."" is ""Don't Say You Don't Remember,"" 1972 by Beverly Bremers."
3,this has been asked like 3 times,"Does anyone know that rap song being played at the end when the kids show up in the helicopter?And as far as the soundtrack goes, no Steely Dan song should ever be covered, especially by Smash Mouth. They absolutely destroyed ""Do It Again""."
3,1 good song,The only part of this cd I liked was total immortal by the offspring the rest were horrible but I thought that total immortal was such a good song I gave the cd 3 stars. In hindsight I think it would have been better to just download the total immortal mp3 and not waste money
4,the push stars shine,"this was overall a fun and enjoyed album, but i must say the push stars absolutely stand out with their fabulous cover of ""bad sneakers"". i saw them on craig kilborn the other night and decided to buy the cd based on that, and that song is definitely the highlight of the album. i'm so glad i got the cd even just for that one song."
3,too many songs missing,"What is the name of the song when Charlie and Irene come out of the cafe and sit on the steps together? He is telling her about his mother and his childhood, and in the background is a very pretty song which starts ""He wrote on the corner of the table..."" and has a chorus which goes ""Don't say you don't remember, I'll never love anyone else..."" This song is not on the soundtrack, it was omitted from the CD as were many other songs. Can someone tell me the song and the group singing it?"
2,Lots of key songs missing,"I really enjoyed this movie and a lot of the songs in the movie.. however, there are a LOT of key songs that establish the feel for this movie, missing on the soundtrack CD. HardKnox, Cake, and there is one song that I have been on an endless mecca to find.. the song when Charlie's sons pull him out of the river in the helicopter at the end.. can SOMEONE PLEASE tell me the name and artist of that song."
1,Give credit where it's due,"""Totalimmortal"" is simply an incredible song and one of my favorites songs ever. Offspring is one of my most hated bands ever. The band that originally wrote and put out ""Totalimmortal,"" AFI, is my favorite band ever.I don't want everyone goin' round saying ""Offspring's 'Totalimmortal' is the best song on the album"" without realizing this song wouldn't even be here if not for the kings of East Bay Hard Core, AFI. So I say to you, put credit where it's due and credit AFI, not the Offspring for the insanely good song."
2,Not for beginners,"I'm new to sashiko, and this book didn't offer much help. It has lots of designs and nice photographs, but the nitty gritty details (how to start/stop stitching, which needle to use, etc) were missing. When the author did offer specifics, she assumed the reader already knew the steps (she said to tie a square knot then a half hitch knot but didn't describe how). The author emphasized continuous machine stitching, yet most of the designs featured parallel lines. Doesn't that mean a lot of starting and stopping? The projects were attractive, but there were few step-by-step illustrations for how to make them.In short, if you're an experienced sewist, you'll probably get more out of this book than I did. If you're a beginner, you might enjoy reading about the history of sashiko and seeing the beautiful designs, but you won't feel ready to start sewing them."
2,Not That Good,"I buy tools for a construction company. I bought two of these kits over a year and a half ago. The screws in the saw base are all ways falling out. The batterys have been replaced twice. BUT the worst thing is, the chucks are always working lose. The drill is balanced good for a 18 volt and the saw (When New) could rip down some 2x lumber."
3,Only 2 really great songs.,There were only 2 really great songs on this CD so it would have been much less expensive to download them from I-tunes.
2,This could have fit on one DVD,"Johnny was the best, and any material from his show will always be greatly appreciated. The material on these DVD's may have been duplicated on the 12-disc set (which I have not completely watched), but not on the Ultimate Johnny Carson Collection (which I have watched repeatedly).HOWEVER, my biggest gripe is how distressingly short these discs are. They claim a run-time of four hours, but that apparently includes the 30 minute ""best of"" featurette and the ""Return to Studio One"" show; the actual clips run just over two hours, spread out over 3 discs. When I sit down to watch a DVD and it's over in 45 minutes (or less!), I feel ripped off.I love Johnny and look forward to seeing more of him on DVD. I just hope the production company doesn't continue packaging little material in multiple sets to raise the prices. Instead, future sets should use the Ultimate Collection as their model; that was a FANTASTIC set."
5,Best lens for the money,"This lens is my fifth lens. I cannot believe how sharp this lens is. The price was very good and it has an equivalent of 100-400mm. It's fast (2.8) and works beautifully. Focus is not the fastest, but not bad either. Less noise with this than my 40-150 lens. The lens is a little heavy, but can still be used hand held or on a tri-pod. If you have IS (Image Stabilization) built into the camera, you will enjoy this lens even handheld in low light."
5,"An excellent lens, worth every panny","I've had my E1, 14-54 and 50-200 for over two years now. They have performed flawlessly. As all Olympus bodies have automatic sensor cleaning, and all three are weather and dust sealed, in over 20,000 photos I've never had to worry about dusty or rainy conditions. I've taken pictures on the beach in windy conditions, indoors at school concerts handheld in low light, and in pouring rain. I've always been delighted with the pictures I get, and the 50-200 is a star performer. It's very sharp, compact for the reach (400mm 35mm equivalent) and speed it gives. And I've since bought the 7-14, giving me an incredible range coverage in 3 lenses."
2,Average,"Whether you are an amatuer or professional, you can do better than this. Not all that useful. Also I note that all these 5-star reviews sound alike and most are from ""A Customer"" hmmmm..."
3,Some songs are better then none!,"Not all of these songs would be consider my favorite, but some songs such as Never Never or I will be waiting are definatly some of the better tracks. So while this CD has a few good songs, it is much better then none at all!~~~~~~*Natalie*~~~~~~~~"
5,great work,so yeah the review up top kinda knocks on the album but trust me flip hes still the man and still underground king he comes to the game with some of the most unique and creative beats Ive ever heard on this album and his voice style helps aid to the general feal of the songs and its not just bland rap each track is like a small masterpiece very good album if you dont know about lil flip yet better tune in because he's here to stay like it or not.
2,Skip It,"i have been a lil flip fan since the start and i have gotta to say. dont believe the hype ..... especially not on this cd. this isnt lil flip at his best . this is lil flip commercialized and its not the real flip. compared to his other cd's this is the worst but im expectin better in the future 1 song on the cd is bangin and thats ""Game Over""just get the clover g mixtape its cheaper and way better!"
1,whoa,"I. Rockwell must have looked up his 10-dollar word in his 10-cent dictionary. ""Quandry"" is not a word - ""quandary"" is, however. All of this goes directly to the problem with this disc, as well as most other rap discs and their listeners. All of them must be forced to pass literacy exams: otherwise, the whole enterprise amounts to nothing more than stupid people hanging out all day listening to the utter vacuity spilling from the gaping maws of other stupid people."
3,"Not Underground Legend, Thats for sure","Well like the title says, this album is no where near Underground Legend, but still is a decent album with a few good songs on it. Id have to agree that it seems like flip went a little mainstream and commercial on this album, but flip is still an all time favorite of mine. His new album is set to release in May and im hoping that its better than this, but this album is still worth listening to, just not what i had expected when i bought it. overall 3 starsTop Tracks1 I Came To Bring The Pain2 Represent3 Dem Boyz4 Yall Dont Want It5 Aint No Nigga"
2,WHAT IS THIS NONSCENCE,This album sucks both discs.Tha lyrics sucked everything sucked.The only songs I liked was Sunshine and Game Over nothing else.
1,I'm not feeling this.,"Lil Flip has produced a good album undaground legend, but this is defintely not one of them, this album is the same old, same old watered down bling-bling nonsense that has been done in his first place, the songs are terrible, and lil flip's has lost his talent, this has got to be the worst thing to come out of houston, Lil Flip would have been better if he had worked with his former manager Humpty Hump.What a Mess."
5,Game Over-Different Look,"For anyone who has ever listened to Lil' Flip, you know this latest CD brings a new style of music to the table. His latest joint definitely brings a new style for Flip. A lot of people argue he has lost his underground flow, but I think the new turn is good for Lil Flip, and it fits him pretty well. The CD features some bangin beats, and features a lot of respected rappers. Better than Undaground Legend by far in my honest opinion. Good CD to pick up, both discs are loaded with good songs."
2,U Gotta Feel Me,"I'm from Houston Texas and been a Lil' Flip fan ever since he was a barely reconizable local rapper. I felt everything Flip made. One of the best CD I've ever hear is Undaground Legends, so I figuered this was going to be better, but unluckiy it wasn't what I expected. Flip always claimed Houston in his prior CDs and that made him gain lots of respect, but on U Gotta Feel Me he doesn't even has one Houston area rapper. There a couple a songs that go off, but overall I don't recommend this CD he fell off."
2,He Fell Off,"Since im from Texas i been a Flip fan forever. But since he signed major, he done fell off. This cd is garbage. He aint the same Lil Flip that i used to hear wreckin the mic for Swisha House. Dont waste your money on this cd cuz Lil Flip has fell off."
1,naw man,This kat is garbage freesytle legend maybe but who is he rapping against the lyrics are the same lame commerical material. Game Over his game hasn't started.
1,Dissapointed!,"I bought this for my guild wars account hoping to add another character slot for a cheap price. Well, they changed the parameters and now you will only get the extra character slot if your account has the Nightfall campaign on it already. I added the key to my account and only received the bonus weapons, not the slot. I emailed guild wars support who informed me that you no longer receive the extra slot unless you purchase Nightfall. I ordered two copies of this hoping to add two slots to my two seperate gw accounts. After all, they were PRE SALE discs therefore any account would not have had Nightfall already on them to receive the extra slot. They changed this after the release of the Nightfall campaign. Just a heads up for anyone wanting to get an extra character slot for a cheap price."
1,Bad Electrical Smell,"very disapointed with this refurbished product. As soon as i got it home and plugged it in, I got a very strong electrical smell coming from the unit. I tried it a few times hoping it was just a 'new part"" smell but it only worsened. I will call the manufacture for a replacement, but what a hasstle and hopefully the replacement unit will work better. I'm finding that newer proudcts don't hold a candle to the older products made years ago. My mom's old blender still works like a charm and boy does it crunch ice!"
5,Simply the Best,"I have had several cordless drills over the years and find the Makita 18 Volt 6343DWAE to be the best. It has plenty of torque for most everyday type fastener applications and works very well as a drill for drilling pilot holes, Etc., however, I would only use this tool in a pinch for drilling very large holes, i.e. holes in studs for running wire -- hey, I have a Hole-Hawg for that! I like this drill so much that I just purchased the same model but with the hammer drill feature - and - I bought the 18 Volt flashlight, too. I highly recommend this tool."
2,The chuck broke,"I just purchased the cordless drill combo kit and went to drill some holes just to tested out how much power there is. I loaded up the drill with 1/2 drill bit and drill about 30 holes into the tree, the battery died after that, also the drill chuck kind of stuck in the middle not very smooth. Is there a quality problems with Makita, casue I've heard so many good thing about it. Anyway I love the weight and balance on this drill."
4,A Good Entry Level Drill Press,"Have used this press for about a year and have drilled through metal, hard woods and soft woods with out any issues. It is easy to assemble and is small and light enough to barely make the ""portable"" grade. I utlimately ended up purchasing the 12"" version because this version isn't compatible with the many Delta accessories, and if you have stock on the table thicker than 2 inches there isn't any clearance between the bit and the stock. If the drill had been compatible with the various Delta accessories I would have rated it a 5.In response to a previous reviewer, changing speeds involves adjusting a belt in the upper housing. This is very easy, and takes less than a minute after dealing with it once."
2,Poor color saturation and bad flavor,"The color saturation of this product is not very good. I was unable to achieve more than a dark pink for my Christmas cookie icing. In addition, the dye made the buttercream frosting taste like chemicals. Very disappointing!"
1,Colours Change!,Another terrible quality product from Wilton - why do they have a monopoly in the USA on cake decorating stuff? There are WAY better products out there. My mom used these colours to make my birthday cake. I went to have another piece 3 days later and the lovely lilac color had turned into a murky blue. The colours don't just change into another attractive colour they go into horrible dingy colours - supposing I had sold a wedding cake and it had changed colour before the day?! Don't risk it and don't waste your money on this terrible product. Don't buy their horrible stiff dry fondant either.
2,Only to see on video but not to buy,This movie had a good concept but the first part of the movie it was like Vivica Foxx wanted to showcase her body because she's over forty and the acting was not great. Carmen Electra was okay and Stacy Dash who I didn't know was 39 looks good but her acting is the same from when she was in Mo Money. Bill Bellemy is still playing the same role but I was glad to see that he has been working out. Sheryl Underwood must be trying to promote herself since she was in this and Something New which is way better than this movie. I wouldn't have released this in the theatre too. I think the ending was a bit cheesy. It should have ended with the guy getting played in the end. I'm tired of these movies that try to wrap it in a bow in the end. Dash should have figured it out and played him and left him in the end. Then the movie would have been true to the name
5,From a great Verdi fan,"What a pleasure to see a traditional but my no means old-fashioned ""Macbeth"". It does not have modern women with pocketbooks figuring as witches like the one from the Met but rather a very pleasant and very lively array of these creatures. The principals and the scenery could belong to any time but, along with the costumes, they are totally believable wherever you want to place them.Keenlyside is superb and so is Monastyrska. I have never heard her before and notice that she will be singing ""Aida"" at the Met this coming season. Although ""Aida"" is not my favorite opera, I definitely will not want to miss Monastyrska.I now own four different ""Macbeth""s. So far, my favorite ""Macbeth"" was the one with Kostas Paskalis and Josephine Barstow but I now would be hard put to decide which one of these two would go to the top of my list. Fortunately, as I now have both, it's a decision I don't have to make.Steffi B. Rath"
3,could be better,"When i received the saw the first thing I noticed was the dust that covered the case. Next was the warranty card was for the 1990's, I emailed the seller with my concerns and he answered that I could return the tool if I had any trouble with it. Sounds fair to me. I've only used the saw twice,it has more than enough power and ,so far the battery is fine. The one thing that suprised me was the second time I took the saw out of the case I found 2 of the screws that hold on the base laying in bottom of the case. I have never had a fastner loose on any makita tool before this. Time will tell."
4,Good Biographical Sketch of Overlooked Founding Father,"The author does an excellent job of underlining the fact each of our Founding Fathers were in some manner motivated by personal gain...nothing wrong with that...naive, perhaps, to think otherwise...doesn't diminish their accomplishments."
5,"""One Great Sander""","A recent comparison article of random ordit sanders in a popular wood working magazine led me to the Bosch 3727DVS sander.Most random orbit sanders are difficult to control in relationship to ""spin out"" and balance. The Bosch in so well balanced that it will sand as agressively as you want it too yet still produce a great swirl free finish.I do recommend for darker hardwoods (walnut & mahogany) to sand to at least 220 grit for a truly undetectale swirl marks. Lighter hardwoods (oak, birch, ash, etc.) swirl marks are undectable as low as 150 grit.Bottom line, ""one great sander"" for control, performance, and value."
2,So so player,The radio tuner on this player is terrible and will only bring in the strongest signal and no signals that another radio right next to it will bring in. The MP3 player part is okay but it does have some problems. The finish is flaking off on my player leaving part of it with a shiny finish and part dull. I also experience the unit shutting down with the slightest bump against something. There are frequently lines in the display that require the player to be shut off to get rid of. If the player experiences a problem and shuts down it does not pick up where it left off but rather goes back to the beginning of the play list. Overall I would say look at other players as I am now doing.
3,Glider of Neptune,Glidermen of Neptune covers the subject of the glidermen of the 101st and 82nd Airborne Division from an American point of view. This becomes especially clear when the author starts discussing the British gliders. The book is very deltailed when it comes to describing the operations until the landing. After landing the story ends. What I missed is how the men were doing after landing. The glidermen did make a difference in Normandy and that does not become clear in this book.A nice story about the subject although the title doesn't cover the story the way it could have done.
1,Terribly disappointed,I have been a fan of Jesse for years. He is a superb guitarist and very artistic. He has written some of the most interesting music for guitar of all modern composers. His previous albums are wonderful. This CD is like nothing he has yet made. The vocal add nothing and detract from his music. I'll still be one of his greatest fans but I don't imagine I'll listen to this one much.
3,Nomad by Jesse Cook,"Very good album, if you like vocals. I prefer instrutmentals and love Cook's other albums."
5,wow factor still exist after 2 years...,"Personal ExperienceAfter an inordinate amount of research, I finally decided on this unit.I've connected my HS20 to my Toshiba HD-DVD player and the look is nothing short of stunning. It's honestly hard tearing myself away from the unit. The picture is that good. Had a friend over to watch the Matrix and the superlatives were flying. Just like being at the theatre was one remark.The unit is whisper quiet. Remote is fine, while the manual could include greater detail on the unit.If I had one negative remark for this unit, I would have wished it to be brighter. The rated 1400ANSI is dramatically reduced when the optimal settings are set. I prefer to have all the lights off in my flat and I've already got a dark room where my PJ sits. I use it exclusively for movies. I still prefer my 25inch CRT for regular viewing of the news, etc.ProblemsFlawless so far."
4,Good bits for the money.,"These bits make a smooth cut and don't try to walk to much when you plunge with them. I did a double mortice for a bed bracket with these bits. Its nice having all the common sizes all together, i like the box it comes in, its great having a place to keep your bits organized and safe. These are not as high quality as Freud or Rockler bits, but what to you expect for the money? If your doing production work these bits will obviously not stand up long but for most people these bits will give you you biggest bang for your buck."
4,Aquarian High-Energy Snare Drum Head,"A nice heavier head for rock and louder music that has good projection quality. Also, have found that it records pretty well when cranked-up with a lower- budget snare, namely, the Ludwig Acrolite snare drum. I used hot rods and the back-beat came out nice and fat. I don't know about lighter things like brush-work, etc., but in the above applications, a good head."
5,Tough head!,"This head is for heavy hitters and those who like their snare heads tight. Tuned right and hit hard, this thing sounds like a gunshot going off. Wouldn't be a good head for brush work or light finesse playing."
4,wireless?,"I received this package thinking that ""wireless"" meant close to or very few wires. I was let down as soon as the package was opened--I saw many wires! A friend helped me put the system together, and, after we were finished, he told me his ordinary, run-of-the-mill surround sound system had the same number of wires! In fact, he recanted his original statement and said that my Kenwood system had more than his junk-Aiwa! This sytem is not ""wireless;"" the system does, however, ""relocate"" the obvious wires that ordinarily stretch across the room. This enables the buyer/listener to avoid the unpleasant sight of cross-wires. On a more pleasant note, this is Kenwood, guys, and the sound is magnificent! I am still pleased with everything even though ""wireless"" is fudging the truth."
4,"Pleasant Change From Blood, Gore and Sex","I saw this movie more than once. A pleasant change from blood, gore and sex as most movies today are plagued with. I admit I originally watched it because of yummy Matthew. (In his undies no less!) But Gary Oldman was fantastic! Could this really be the forbidding Count Dracula? I thought all of the characters were well acted and the subject matter worth thinking about. I worked for many years with handicapped children and their world IS different than ours. I found the subject realistic because many parents cannot accept a ""different"" child.I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because I didn't like the ending. It seemed to need another half hour to see if Steven could put it back together with Carol. Also, because the women's wardrobes were too bizarre for my tastes and I found that distracting. Call me lop sided because I suppose I would like ANYTHING with the divineMr. McC in it!"
1,Yes this is a bad movie.,The reviews said this was movie that would be better off not having been made....and they were right! Great fun seeing the wonderful cast stumble through the horrible dialog and action though. Well worth the .62 cents I paid for it!
1,Dead. Boring.,"This game has good possibilities, but it is ruined by the lack of people on the two servers this game has. Everytime I logged in, all I saw was little to no one on. If people had been on, they were away from keyboard status or link dead. The actual system of the game is kinda cool, how you create your character, by selecting the powers and path you want to follow, but after the first few steps, it becomes confusing and you dont know where to go.... Pass on this one. If it becomes free, then pick it up."
5,Purple Icing,"I made a three layer Monster High cake with the purple icing. I used strawberry icing for trim. It was the best cake I have ever made. The color was perfect with the pink. And,oh boy, it was delicious. I got some of the dark purple on my sweater. I thought for sure it would stain. It washed right out a day later. I highly recommend Scott's Icing to everyone. I think everyone should try it. The price was good for the quality of the icing."
3,True Stories in the News,"The stories were good, but the book was rather old looking. I would recomment it for beginning students in English."
2,Flashes of cleverness not enough to sustain the story.,"Initial flashes of cleverness and artful story-telling rocket you through the first half of the book. From then on, plot and story fizzle out like a guttering candle--and so does the reader's desire to continue on. It's almost as if Rechy is frosting a cake and discovers he doesn't have quite enough frosting for the whole; but instead of making more frosting, he chooses to make do by thinning out what he already has applied. Pity!"
5,WAH HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!!!!!,"I laughed myself to death watching this movie!!! It is downright hilarious and funny! My whole family loves it and they always get a kick out of it, especially the ride down the side of the apartment building! Now THAT was funny! HA HA HA! I'm cracking myself up here! Get it and see it! Yes, it is funny!!!"
5,Just a good movie,"A very entertaining movie that you can watch over and over. No sex, violence or bad language. Movie received on time and in excellent condition. Would definitely deal with this seller again."
5,first wives club,I am very pleased with my piurchase and the service was very quick. I would order again.
1,One of the few movies I wanted to walk out on.,"I realize I'm not the target audience being a college student when this came out, but I'm usually pretty tolerant of films direction and messaging - however, wow, couldn't take it. Even as a college student I thought the plot of revenge to be childish and weak, these are supposed to be role models of successful women? I guess the idea is it isn't meant to be taken seriously, but still seemed more harsh than funny and didn't really have much respect for the characters by the end. Plot was pretty weak, acting wasn't that hot, writing wasn't that good."
5,I Loved This Movie! Really Really Good Movie! Great Cast!,I loved this movie alot! It was a really really good movie! It had an excellent cast in it! Really great cast! The Movie is about three women who get revenge on their ex-husbands who divorced them for younger women! They get good revenge on their ex-husbands! Great Movie!
5,Awesome movie!!,"I usually don't review movies...but when I saw that the majority of bad reviews for this movie were some obsessed idiot's spam, I wanted to set the record straight! So, if you are looking at the negative feedback, notice the repetition and phrasing and realize the same jerk wrote it all. This movie has something for everyone. Great acting, tears, laughter. And when they sing at the end, I love it!!"
3,A fun comedy all the stars shine,"A enjoyed this film and mainly it was becouse of the stars. Three legends all in one film bette Midler is great, Goldie Hawn is halariouse and then there is Diane Keaton who is the weakest link but still good. the story is funny as 3 divorced women get revenge ont here husbands. Overall the film is good it has some slow parts which makes the film only a good film and not great."
3,"Great Cast, Weak Script","It's hard to go wrong with the likes of Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn, and Diane Keeton; each actress is unique, and the trio play well with each other. Unfortunately, the material isn't what it should be-- and most of the belly laughs rely on the stars' on-going ability to turn lead into gold."
2,Not the Best Jackie Book I've Read,"The thing that irritated me most about this book is the fact that the author does not know how to punctuate sentences or use correct verbage. It seemed to me like a fifth-grader wrote it and forgot to use the spell check. Also, the author gets bogged down in details that really had nothing to do with Jackie Kennedy Onassis (the Bossa Nova section almost put me to sleep).I suggest you save your money and buy the video instead."
4,A Teacher's Perspective,"While not all of the stories in this book count as great literature by today's standards (although some certainly do), the title story in this collection is seriously thought provoking. Some of the best discussions in my 8th grade English class were spurred on by ""The Lady or the Tiger,"" which is an excellent story to use to further the development of critical thinking skills. It also serves as a literary Rorshach test, promoting self exploration and evaluation. Frank Stockton obviously respected children's ability to think for themselves, and his appreciation for the intelligence of the young clearly comes through in these stories. I enjoyed reading this one when I was a teenager, and love passing it on to my students. If somehow, you have missed reading this, I highly recommend it."
1,Completely Peter'd out on us...TWICE!,Everything was going well for my four year old when the system shut down on the 4th song. New batteries and different AV connections to the other 5 open ports on my TV left me feeling like I had a lemon. I took it back and exchanged it for another brand new one. This time it took one song and it zonked out...AGAIN.Unreliable and not built to withstand a 4 year old girl??? What gives?!My system is being returned for good. This absolutely was the worst product I've ever purchased regardless of the price!
5,whoo hoo!,"my boyfriend surprised me with this:D whoo hoo!!! i have a question though--wheres the little box you mark that says ""already owned"" ??? i cant find it anywhere and i think it used to be below all the comments.."
1,Beware - the worst I have ever owned,"Not exactly sure if this is the same model number but my wife bought me a Remington with this same ""cleaning station"" setup. The cleaning station broke down after approx 6 weeks and the metal parts that were submerged in the alcohol/oil mix had actually rusted out. The shaver itself was the most uncomfortable I have ever used and drew blood and made my neck look red and angry more often than not. I dumped this overpriced gimmick for a $38 Norelco and I swear my face jumped for joy that day."
2,Save your money,"I bought this shaver a couple of months ago and I stopped using it. If you do not grow a great deal of facial hair then this shaver will be fine to purchase, but i have hair on my neck and this does not get to them unfortunatly. The top part of my face the machine shaves but I will have to reshave in a day. The cleanining system is the worst part of this deal it says it is an automatic cleaning system but it really doesnt clean at all, I have to dissassemble the shaver and run it through with water to get the hairs out of the way. My advice is still with the razor blades it will cost less money and less headache."
3,Captain Beefheart: The Buddah Years,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EGGBG2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgThe Buddah YearsThe quality of the CD was very good as described (used). The CD itself was good if you like Zappaistic lyrics. It has many shining points but doesn't seem to be as consistent as his other albums. I give it a 5 out of an overall 10.
5,What a value,"My buddy has this cd and he lent it to me. Within 2 weeks I bought it used for about $4.00 delivered. If you like 50's music and love songs, these are good tunes. HIGHLY recommended."
3,First Bible Stories,Still looking for first addition. Bigger brighter and kid friendly. The original was put out about 2001 or 2002.Put out by Jillian and fabulous artist.
4,grass cutter,"I love this lawn mower, it's easy to start and easy to push around, it takes care of my grass just fine. The only problem I am having is finding an air filter for it. Lowes, Home Depot, Amazon even the Yard Man dealer does not have them. Where in the world do I buy parts?"
3,A Big Let Down!!,"I, like others, bought this for the vacuum feature. The vacuum catches about 75% of the hair but it never collects in the collection tray. I dont know where it is goin. The blade and 9 different settings are good but that feature comes on just about every trimmer model. Bottom line is if you want to try because of the vacuum feature, DONT!!!"
1,not the best trimmer available,"This trimmer is a disaster! The blades caught and pulled my beard. The flimsy plastic guide frequently slipped off the side tracks. The vacuum picks up only maybe 50% of the whiskers, so you still have a mess to clean up. The unit is big and heavy. My complaints to Remington Customer Service have resulted in only the suggestion to ""use a pre-shave product"". I'm going back to my Norelco Acu-Control trimmer."
3,"Entertaining yet predictable, technical errors.","Dark Water Dive was a typical murder mystery & it was easy to figure out whodunit before the ending although the ""why"" had a nice twist. I would have liked to see al ittle more development of other characters in the book, specifically the boss & the love interest. The diving was well done except for a couple of technical errors that you wont notice if you arent a certified scuba diver. Easy beach read that wont tax your brain too much trying to remember alot of characters & plot twists..."
3,Not as interesting as Chainer's Torment,"The book gives and ending to the Odyssey Cycle. It does its job dutifully, and brings the whole story to full circle. However, it doesn't impress me particularly with the story nor the writing. This is not to say that it is bad, but it is not excellent either (hence the 3 stars). The ending is again kind of sloopy (like Chainer's Torment), and doesn't really explain what happens next for Kahmahl or Jeska. I guess it will have to continue in Onslaught."
1,v6 Performance,This book is very out dated!! It is a history of the V6 engine up to the early 80's. Look for a more up to date book.
2,"Very pooly written, does not show the human side of Andrea","My name is Rick Jackson. If you read the acknowledgements, you'll see me listed as a contributor. I am currently married to Andrea (Sand) Mims, who continutes to serve a life sentence after being falsely convicted of 1st degree murder. The Andrea depicted in ""Rancho Mirage"" is not the Andrea I know and love. Saroyan painted a very negative picture of her based on transcripts, police reports, and interviews with prosecution witnesses. A history of Andrea's life and a little investigation would have revealed a very different story. I would like to write a follow-up book, tentatively to be titled ""Rape of an Angel."" I would welcome the assistance of any writer able to help in this project"
4,Great game,Monopoloy is a classic and we love the Georgia Bulldogs so this was right up our alley. Fun to play and even better to see all the great Dawg hang outs!
3,Uneven,"Some of the tracks are great, other less so. The quality of the production is also uneven. Not bad altogether, but maybe he should have put more work into it before releasing it"
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"Our five year old was so happy to get this for Christmas this past year, but the pirate ship is probably the worst constructed toy we have ever had. The designers of this toy did not take into account the target age group and their ability to put the pieces back together. The minute you touch the ship it falls apart, leaving the child frustrated and disappointed. I definately DO NOT recommend this toy, ESPECIALLY for how much it costs! Totally not worth it!"
2,Cake cutter,A serrated knife works better. Maybe I can find another use for this? Perhaps I didn't use it correctly though.
2,ok but,"I like Joe Vitale and think he does care about others (I do not know who Mark Ryan is), but this DVD was incredibly boring and after viewing it 3-4 times we could not watch in anymore. I do not know if subliminals work or not but for us it was a ""not""."
3,"like them all, but like the vampires best","Derik, a werewolf who suddenly discovers he's become an Alpha, is sent off on a mission to take care of the reincarnation of Morgan Le Fay (Dr. Sara Gunn), per the instructions of the seer of the Wyndham werewolves. If Derik doesn't do this, she sees a vision of the apocalypse. But Sara has no idea that the fate of the world is in her hands or that she is an incarnation of the evil sorceress. The hilarity in this comedic romance doesn't stop, especially when they set off to stop `the bad guys' - a cult that is trying to reincarnate King Arthur. The humor is sharp and quick, although I prefer Davidson's `undead' series featuring Betsy, the Vampire Queen. I will read anything by MaryJanice Davidson...I even have some of her YA books, published years ago."
1,Read it at the library,"The main story is okay, typical MJD and good to read on a quiet, lazy afternoon. I don't understand why the Derek character somehow turned into a surfer dude when he started out talking like a regular person but ... whatever dude. The sex and romance were very rushed, I suppose it had to be in order to fit everything into so few pages!I read all the reviews and was surprised no one mentioned the second story. Maybe my library had a different version and I was just unlucky enough to get the bonus. I would have been mad if I paid for this, only to find the last third of the book is a separate novella -- a horrid rape ""romance"" that reads like something written by a cave man. Rape, bondage, forced blood feeding, constant use of the female c word ... yes that is so very romantic. Seriously, it was that bad. I had to stop."
3,brain candy,"Derik, a werewolf from MaryJanice Davidson's east-coast Pack of Wyndham werewolves, is on a mission: he has been told to ""take care of"" Dr. Sarah Gunn, the reincarnation of Morgan Le Fay - lest she destroy the world. The only problem? Sarah isn't evil. In fact, she's downright cute, and too lucky for words. When Derik literally cannot kill her, he and Sarah decide to team up to take a cross-country road trip to track down and eliminate the real threat.The story was cute. I finished it quickly, but I think if I had had to put the book down, I would have been hard-pressed to pick it back up. I didn't care overmuch what happened - I knew that Sarah and Derik would end up together and that the world would be saved. I knew the ""twist"" almost from the beginning.The best way for me to describe Davidson's writing is ""brain candy."" I know it's empty calories, so to speak, but it's addictive in the same way cotton candy is: fluffy, full of air, saccharine-sweet, and you just can't get enough."
5,Keeps the temperature in my house down!,"I placed these blinds on 3 windows and am very glad I did. Living in the mountains, we don't need airconditioning, but the house can get too warm when the sun beats in. These blinds have definately helped keep the house cooler. They were easy to install, look good, and are easy to raise and lower. I didn't intially install the lower clip, but am doing so as the blinds tend to ""flap"" against the house with a breeze. We are very pleased with our purchase."
3,Needs some tweaking,"I bought two of these and waited a week after installing the first one to see if I was going to adjust and deal with the problem it had and go ahead and install the 2nd or if I would hate it completely and return the 2nd.I have a large screened in porch that faces West. It gets HOT in the late afternoon and I thought these would be perfect to keep the sun off the porch and as an added plus, keep the rooms just beyond the porch a bit cooler.The shades do keep the sun from cooking the porch and from shining further in through the house windows, but the roll up feature sucks. The previous roll up shade I had came with cords on either end and one in the middle. These only have cords on the ends and the width is such that the ends rolls up okay, but unless you have a second person guiding the shade as you roll it up, the center is extremely loose and messy. Looks awful.That being said, I did install the 2nd one, I just try not to look at them when they are raised."
5,To Catch A King,"I watched this movie several years ago, and enjoyed it very much. For some strange reason I thought about it again. Did some research and found it on Amazon."
1,"Didn't receive 5, received 1 pulley","Thought I was ordering a set of 5 pulleys, shipped as one unit, from first line of product description: ""Sold as one unit. (1 unit = 5 each.) Single."" I only received one pulley. Was a really expensive pulley. Don't know if this is poor translation, or a trick to sell a pulley for way more than it was worth. Same pulley is selling for way less than listed here at other locations."
2,"Made in China, cheap alloy",I purchased this to replace a door handle that stripped out on a 1995 Gmc Vandura 3500. I never leave reviews but had to for this product. It snapped off after less than a month of use. Spend a couple extra dollars and get a better one.
3,A+ for Ice Fishing.,"very nice real. works smoothly and good single bearing. maybe a little grinding noise but not very noticable to the average guy. hope it wont be a problem down the road.i always take out the clicker on my fly reels as i use them for ice fishing and dont want people to hear me crankin in the fish, and out of the 2 that i bought, i could only unscrew one. seems they use a type of loctite on the mechinism (spelling?).unfortunatly i had to break off the clicker on the second reel.but i was able to flip the bearing easily for leftys and am very happy with the product.for ice fishing i would personally go with the 4/5 over the 2/3. its a little small but fits nicely in your hand"
5,GREAT REEL FOR THE MONEY,"SMOOTH ACTION, GOOD BRAKING AND REALlY WORTH THE ATTRACTIVE PRICE. HANDLES LIKE A REEL THAT COSTS 3 TIMES AS MUCH AS THE OSUMA. EASILY HOLDS 150 YARDS OF BACKING AND ALL THE FLY LINE."
5,looks and works great,This faucet looks and works great. It came within 3 days of ordering it. Actually arrived on a holiday! We give a quick wipe down with a dish towel or microfiber cloth and it stays nice and shiny.
1,Exploitation,"Don't buy this one! Although the voice is eternal, this CD was produced by greedy people who decided to try make a quick buck and who picked up discarded takes and left-overs and put them together with a lot of talk and little music. Phyllis would certainly have disapproved - may her soul rest in peace!"
2,Making a quick buck......,"This Cd is only for the hardcore Hyman fan, who have to own every note she ever recorded(like me). The producers quickly put out this CD after her death to obviously capitalize on her passing. Hyman reportedly loved to sit in on sessions and that is what this is, but the quality, despite her voice, is just not there. If you are a newcomer to Phyllis, check out the many other fine examples of her immense talent. When you become an addict to her voice(and you will), then there may be room in your collection for this CD. Be forewarned, though."
5,good book,"Very good book, It came highly recommended and was special in so far as it was not a species identification book. The Author, the Perspective, and the Scope of the book are all extraordinary."
5,It Does What I Ask Of It,This batter head tamed the unwanted ring and resonance of an old Slingerland snare drum. The snare is no longer the weak link in an otherwise fine drum kit.
1,Would not Recommend,"Based on the previous reviews, I was expecting a totally different fragance. I was quite shocked when my order arrived and I eagerly sprayed the perfume for a sample, to only be truly disappointed by the scent. It's a very heavy scent -- it almost makes me think of a little old lady.According to the previous reviews, this was also a perfume that Michael Jackson wore for years. Wow! I can't imagine that he would want to smell like a little old lady! This is not a manly scent by any means."
5,Bal a Varsailles,Bal a Versailles has a unique pleaseing fragrence which sets you out from the crowd.
1,Don't buy this item!,"I bought this shoe organizer about a month ago and I am throwing it away today! I loved the idea that it held so many pairs of shoes, but the materials are VERY cheep and the pockets for the shoes are WAY too short. I have small feet (size 6) and the shoes still stick halfway out and fall out with any movement of the door. Has the potential to be a great product, but too bad the company decided to cut the corners and create a product that is a waste of money."
1,Very Misleading in Size,"Notice the photo. It shows lots ofbig shoes cluttering-up the floor ofthe closet, and then after the productis used, no clutter. The implicationis that shoes bigger than small highheels can fit in it. NOT TRUE. The shoeson the left (BEFORE photo)are not the onesthat were put away in the SHOES AWAY! Thisproduct is only big enough (in each spaceprovided) for a small pair of high heels to be stored!!I recommend this only for children or verysmall ladies. I have size 11 shoes and itSOOOO does not hold my shoes. I have to scrunchthem up to get them in or only put one of the shoes, not both,in one or every other one of the slots. That means the numberof pairs of shoes that is advertised as what it holds, does not applyto larger sizes at all!"
2,sucked!,"very flimsy product, not meant to hold that many shoes, mine ended up ripping off the hangers because it was too heavy. don't buy it!"
1,Doesn't hang right and ripped,"For such a simple product, we couldn't figure out how to hang it so that the shoes angled down, and didn't fall out. There are some mystery straps that we tried to macgyver, but that didn't work. The shoes kept falling out. Then I saw that it was ripping at the seams, and that was the end. Back it goes."
2,do not waste money,"Thought I was purchasing the same thing that I had owned for about 10 years and had worked wonderfully. My first one was showing it's age and plastic was starting to tear, so I replaced it with what I thought was an identical item. Have only had this up a couple of weeks and things are breaking already, rendering it unusable. I have fewer pairs of shoes in it then the old one, because I cleaned out when hanging the new one and it could not even handle fewer pairs of shoes. Steer clear..."
1,Garbage,Pure garbage. Fits a child's shoe only. I wear mens 10. Ripped two pockets trying to get a shoe in. Thew it away the same day I received it.
1,piece of sheet paper,"I admit I was not using the product as it was intended probably. However, the material was so cheap I could give it a slight tug and it would tear, more similar to paper towel than canvas. The wood stabilizers on each level might been sturdier if there was popsicle sticks in there instead of the balsa wood the manufacturer opted to use. The one bright spot is the sturdy plastic D ring that connects the rack to the hooks, they didn't even break when the rest of the rack quickly detached from the hooks. Unless you have 36 or so pairs of flip flops or slippers DO NOT BUY! If you are a sneakerhead DO NOT BUY! If you are a big-footed woman DO NOT BUY! If you have the money to buy something nicer I suggest you keep on looking. Don't waste your time with this thing."
2,it broke!,"It broke!. I've had it on the door with a pair of shoes in each slot for about a week and this morning it broke. the plastic rings didn't hold up on one side and the strap let loose on the other. I'm going to get metal rings from the hardware store and re-enforce the straps by sewing them better to fix it but they really should start out with metal rings and re-enforce the straps. Otherwise, it's a great concept. I like that it holds so many more pairs of shoes than the other one I have that is flat and can only hold one shoe per pocket."
2,disappointed,"nice idea but the openings for the shoes are way too small i guess if you are organizing kids shoes well i guess it will work, so i cant use it"
1,Big dissapointment,"The shoe rack collapsed only two days after I diligently organized my shoes in it. Truth be told I wasn't surprised, I couldn't comprehend how those flimsy plastic hooks could possibly hold up 35 pairs of shoe, and surely enough it couldn't and didn't. Needless to say, if I saw this in a store I wouldn't have purchased it, but it looked like a good idea online."
1,Not Worth It,"I've had the same experience as other reviewers. I was really thrilled at first because of the number of shoes it could hold. But then I discovered that while flats fit fine, shoes with heels fall out regularly (I'm a size 7). Worse yet, over the course of a few months, one by one, the dividers started giving away and now the whole thing's falling apart. Guess I'll have to forgo the quantity in favor of quality....."
5,Wow!!!,"Making the decision to read a fiction story along with a non-fiction book concurently my librarian suggested a Ann Rule Book. Well, I am a fan now. The only problem is the truth sometimes reads more like fiction than fiction itself. This man was truly a monster, to his family and society itself. If Lucifer is on earth he probably is in the body of Allen. I Will now begin my journey to read all of Ann Rules works, I am sure I will enjoy them all."
1,Caren,"This is absolutely the worst written book that I have ever read. Perhaps it doesn't matter, because the story IS riveting. Having read other Ann Rule books, I have to wonder if she had less experienced staff members write it for her. It is written in a choppy manner, with various grammatical issues, as well (I'm no expert on grammar -- but these issues are obvious). I can believe that much effort was put into researching this book, but I wish more effort had been put into the writing of this book."
2,D U L L,"Why, why, why did we have to learn about the grandparents of Sheila and Alan? What did that have to do with the story? While I felt very bad that Sheila was brutally murdered, I think Ann Rule tried to make Sheila this poor helpless creature when infact, Sheila had lots of avenues to take if she really wanted to get away from Alan. I love Ann Rule's true crime however, this time she definately missed the mark."
4,"Not bad, not great","For the most part, this book is well-written and presents the researched facts in an orderly fashion. However, it goes on FOREVER! I love Ann Rule's writings, but does she always have to use titles and lines from once popular songs for her book titles? You Belong To Me, Every Breath You Take, etc., etc.Blackthorne is a wicked man, if man he be. As for Sheila, I felt sorry for her, but didn't understand why she didn't get out sooner. While she definitely was no angel, either, she didn't deserve to be abused. I was happy that she found a good man the second go-round. However, she allowed him to abuse her children. When their father abused them, she made it a court case. When their step-father did it, she joined in. My Dad was a Marine D.I. and he wasn't an abusive parent. So,in my opinion, Jamie Bellush has no excuse for abusing children, his or not. Why the girls let him adopt them is beyond me."
2,Boring -- Wait for the City Confidential Version,"This is a ""true-crime"" novel about an abused wife/mother who leaves her wealthy, charming husband after years of marriage. The husband wants revenge and stalks her and eventually brutally murders her. This is where the story begins.The story itself is interesting enough. And Rule does a good job of keeping your attention for a while. But after the murder, the ensuing court case just goes on and on. It's as though Rule has made a deal to mention everyone in the book that she interviewed, so she has to give the most intricate details of the court case in order to fit everyone in.Bottom line: The TV show City Confidential could do a great job with this story (if it hasn't already), but as a book it's just plain boring. One of the few books I was not able to finish."
2,Not one of her best,"This was not one of Ann Rule's best books. ""Bitter Harvest"" and ""Stranger Beside Me"" are much better reads.In a nutshell: ""Every Breath You Take"" is too long and it's difficult to sympathize with the individual(s) as they were portrayed in the book."
1,600 pages should have been 300!,"The story is interesting but way, way too long. Ann Rule's books keep getting worse. Her first books were great but have gone down hill lately. Some are nothing more than old newspaper articles put into book form. This one is half filler material about houses, cities, wedding dress descriptions.........yawn. I'm done spending good money on bad Ann Rule books."
2,B O R I N G,"That's the best way to describe this book. There were times I couldn't keep my eyes open. Sheila Bellush was by all accounts, smart...so why did she stay with the bird faced Allen?(which Ann Rule continuously calls ""handsome"")... If that's not enough, she deals with him bringing home prostitutes both male and female(not to mention a few lovers in between). She finally has enough and leaves the man she fears, only to move on the same block with him? Then we are bored with the family tree....we have to go back to the childhoods of Allen and Sheila's parents. While the only interest lies with Allen's family, because his life with them, would mold him into the person he would become. Maybe it's because the victim herself wanted Ann Rule to write her story, but I feel Ms. Rule just threw in too much needless information. The real interest lies in the killer himself. That would have been an interesting story..."
4,Beyond Brilliant,This book was so awesome! I really enjoyed it and it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. When I was reading it I got so into it that when I went to sleep I had the light oN! It was truly an awesome book!
3,A little different,"This was not what I expected it to be.First the Satanic Bible was more a fluent read. I got the Devil's Notebook and it was more of compiled essays and thoughts.The thoughts and essays themselves are both comical and has a very different view on people, thinking and that sort thing. I have enjoyed reading this book.I have liked to pick this one off and on because really you don't have to read it from beginning to end, so I read chapter whenever...just sort of picking it out of the contents page.A good readThanks :-)"
2,I Remember When Satan Was Scary,"Suppsedly hundreds of thousands members worldwide, Lavey codified satanism into a religion. Trying to pave the way, he denied any illegal activity by members. That is not what most people think of when they think of satanism, and for mabny it was no longer scary. It seems supposd ""satanists"" don't even have a horror film fan's understanding of the subject. Lavey is not legitimate."
5,One of the first still one of the best serial killer novel,"I've read this book a long time ago and loved it then and still love it now. The author tracks his two main protagonists that is the female serial killer, a rarity in literature as well as in life, and his cop, with great skill. We simpathize with her even while she butchers her victims, slipping down a slippery slope that she seems to be able to recognize, but not to stop. We also seem to feel that she is not particularly smart or bright, no superwoman at all. A mousy woman that transforms at night not with the help of a cat suit or a mask but simple flashy dress and makeup. Delaney comes back to us loyal readers of the first and second deadly sins, dripping his wet sandwiches over the sink, trampling in his heavy boots all through Manhattan, solving the crime as always through patient police work and sheer doggedness. A treat to lovers of crime fiction and still holds its own after all those years."
3,A little too short...,"I really think this book is good for beginners and for those who have no idea of what the movements mean in generel. However I find the book a bit too generel, leaving very few specifics on how to actually perform the movements. Another thing is that this book is quite expensive for it's size. The book is pretty small and has only something like 80 pages if you don't count all the advertisements as real pages.I think the book holds some good points, but it somehow leaves the reader wanting more. I read the entire book in about an hour and a half.This is not a bad book, it just think this is little else than an introduction to wing chun system."
3,Don Redman and his orchestra 1931-1933,"Don Redman was one of the great jazz arrangers of all time and this CD has some wonderful songs.The highlights of this 24 selection disc are ""Shakin' The African,"" ""Chant Of The Weed,"" ""I Heard,"" ""You Gave Me Everything But Love,"" ""Doin' What I Please,"" ""Nagasaki,"" ""Doin' The New Low-Down"" (both versions) and the medley of ""Shuffle Your Feet/Bandanna Babies.""""You Gave Me Everything But Love"" is a classic sung by Harlan Lattimore, whose voice is incredible on this number...five stars for this song.The take of ""Doin' The New Low-Down"" with Bojangles Robinson is lively and cheerful and, if you close you eyes, you can ""see"" Mr. Bojangles tapping away. In simple terms...GREAT!The ""Shuffle Your Feet/Bandanna Babies"" medley is superior, too, with Harry and Donald Mills supplying wonderful vocals.There are a few weak spots...but the highlights mentioned are well worth the purchase price...JMB"
4,"Two Books, Identical Content","These authors have also written a book titled ""Intelligent Decision Support Methods"". The two books (""Seven Methods"" and ""Intelligent Decision Support"") are virtually identical. They have the same content, the same graphics, the same layout, the same case studies. The basic content (first 202 of 250 pages) is word for word, page for page IDENTICAL. The ONLY diffference between the 2 books is that ""7 Methods"" includes suggested solutions for the case studies (adding about 1 page for each of the 7 case studies). Do NOT buy ""Intelligent Decision Support Methods"". It is twice as expensive (hard cover vs soft cover) with no benefit."
5,An excellent introduction to cutting-edge methodologies,"I found the book extremely well-designed for three reasons: First, the description of the ""seven methods"" is accompanied by a conceptual framework where the pros and cons of each are discussed and compared. Second, despite being a business-oriented book, it provides the reader with all the quantitative details needed to access more technical readings. Third, the authors use a very readable language throughout the book."
2,A passable adaptation at best,"Well, to start off with, if you're not familiar with the underlying book, this will probably have absolutely zero appeal to you.For fans of the book, this is mostly a let down. Most of the clever, funny, endearing, and amusing scenes from the book have either been excised in the film or just haven't translated to film all that well. It's kind of a pity, because the excellent television adaptation of Hogfather showed that the Discworld can be adapted to screen successfully.Recommendation: pass, go directly to Hogfather."
2,a bit of a dud,"It's hard to know what to say about this: they had such a mish-mash of ideas that came to nothing. But some of them were good.One thing that'll make you sit bolt upright is the ending, which is abrupt, unexpected, thought-provoking, and, well, French in character.However, thinking back on it, I don't think the movie ""earned"" that ending: it was not that coherent. It seemed rather that they didn't know how to tie the two story threads together and so simply ended it by rolling the credits. I found this highly dissatisfying and weird for a movie that was so light-hearted in character: it was almost like it was a betrayal of what went before, rather than a completion or a resolution.And the tourist? Please! Why couldn't it have just been about a rogue wizard on the run? That was a serviceable enough premise! Why'd you have to add all that other junk?"
4,Needs subtitles,"I am among those who loved it, knowing a movie will never quite ""be"" the novel, but, with double, or triple echo on Death's voice, it really needs subtitles to help understand his dialogue. With them, I probably would give it 5 stars."
3,Color of Magic DVD,"The Color of Magic is entertaining but not too funny. There are some interesting characters and ideas, but the movie lacks depth and does not always make sense. The book with the same characters related to the movie, The Light Fantastic, is better. But the book is very much written in the same style as the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy books by the late Douglas Adams, which are better than the Light Fantastic."
4,The Color of Magic,This was an all around geat movie for a mixed audience of adults and children of different ages. We will enjoy it again several times.
1,So Bad,"This movie is dumber than ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"". The actors must have REALLY needed the money. Do yourself a favor, pass it up and buy a nice cigar instead."
3,Campy Humor!,"I Liked this movie because of the campy humor, but it is not for everyone. The graphics were well done too!"
4,WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!,"I saw these advertised on QVC and was curious enough to give them a try. WOW... I was very surprsed with the results and the ease of use. It only takes about a minute to apply to your whole body and it really does dry instantly. I will warn you though that it will take 2 to 3 towelettes to cover your body. I have fair skin and it took 3 applications to get the color that I was looking for. I originally bought a box of 10 towelettes and used 8 of them to get a nice looking tan. But after that, it just takes 2 towelettes every 5 to 7 days to keep the tan. Overall, I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants an nice golden tan. If you are looking for a ultra dark tan, then this is not the product for you."
3,"Nice color, horrible smell and streaks","Ok, so i was so excited to finally get my tan towels, but due to either my mismanagement or something, i have streaks-- especially on the first leg i started on. My left foot also came out very stained looking...i guess i need to perfect this method. I did like the color in the morning, but a warning to you: it SMELLS. it really really does.I am going to try again tonight, but at this point unsure if i'll buy again."
5,Arguably the best review of the Luby's massacre ever written,"If you are interested in a straight forward play- by-play of how the Luby's Cafeteria Massacre carried out, then this book is your first choice. From a detailed history of George Hennard and events leading up to his rampage to the aftermath that ensued, this book flows in an easy to read and gripping style. No prejudices or bias' are forced on the reader. The facts and people are presented as they were and you are left with many questions and conlusions. This is a superior review to modern day mass murder and to true crime in general. Pick it up if you love a good read."
2,Use Only if You're Counting Carbs or Evaluating Fast Food,"Over 1/3 of the total book pages are devoted to fast food evaluation, broken down into calories, fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, protein, and carbs. If you're a fast food eater, than this will probably be a good guide for you. However, if you're looking for a calorie counter for basic foods...this is not your guide. The rest of the foods are broken down according to calories, fat, and carbs. That's it. There are very small sections devoted to protein, salt, fiber, etc. counters, but these don't even begin to cover the range of basic foods we all probably eat on a daily basis.In short, handy to have for carb counting and fast food evaluating. Otherwise...save yourself the $."
2,Not as much information as I expected,"The book contains saturated fat data for only fast food. Different types of information are presented for different types of foods. Space is wasted on a rehash of basic nutritional concepts that everyone already knows (food pyramid, calcium is good for you, etc.)."
5,Beautifulness,"This case meets all of my expectations. It's a good value, and the pockets are big enough to hold all my stuff.--Rachel"
2,Good Overview but redundant,"Here are my opinions after buying and reading the book.- If you are student / fresher who wants to ""learn"" System Verilog then skip this book. This book assumes that you already know Verilog well.- This book deals only with design. Authors plan to come up with one more for Verification.- If you have plenty of cash ($130 for design and $130 for verification book) or your rich company pays for your books then go ahead and add this book to your library. If not then read free LRM http://www.eda.org/sv/SystemVerilog_3.1a.pdf- Practice, practice, practice. Just by reading Verilog books no one has become a good design/verification engineer.(...)Verilog won't become IEEE standard as it is. Thus this book will be superceded by a version which is slightly different anyway."
3,Not useful as a reference,"System Verilog is the ASIC HDL of the future, and this is one of the first books specifically addressing its use for Design, as opposed to Assertions or Testbenches. As such, it is an important book. And the authors are certainly Verilog experts.My main criticism of the book is that it's not so useful as a reference. I pull it off this shelf, flip to the back, and often find the Index lacking. It's only four pages long, which is awfully short for such a long technical textbook."
1,Chasing Her Own Ambulance,"I was really excited to get my hands on this book. Having suffered from eating disorders myself, I was hoping it would re-affirm my recovery efforts.Imagine my surprise and disappointment after drowning in the hubris and shameless self-promotion that pours from every page of A Very Hungry Girl. The book prompted me to write my first Amazon review.I couldn't believe that there were positive Amazon reviews until I noticed that many of them hail from the author's friends. This manuever is wholly in line with the thinly-veiled thesis of the book. The author hopes to profit from her disease and even more abhorrent, the suffering of others.I wish I could write that the book is mediocre but at least the intention is heroic, but I cannot.Please, please, please read Life Inside the Thin Cage by Constance Rhodes for less ego and more inspiration."
3,Not my fav,This tea is just okay. I love Yogi teas but much prefer their Ginger or Licorice tea. I will buy those next time instead of this one.
5,Excellent tea,I am a tea lover and this Yogi Tea is my favorite in all kind of ways: it has an excellent taste and its smell is inviting and exotic. Just love it!
4,Much Fun!...,"...Although too much STEW, GLADIATORS, and GALLEY SHIPS. (Although the first may be legit, I've never encountered a fantasy novel incorporating the other two.) A must read for any and all who are tired of all the old cliches. If nothing else, buy it for the map and introduction!"
4,A great and fun book,"A great read for would be fantasy writers. Some parts are little... short and seem to be lacking. Overall, its a fun read but I wouldn't read all of it, just what applies to you."
2,A Look at Cliches,"This book looks at the cliches from the fantasy genre. I bought it because, as a fantasy author, I figured it could help me steer clear of cliches. It does offer laughs, and I was glad to see that I'm not the only one who has noticed that caravans in fantasy literature are ALWAYS ambushed early on. But I thought it could have been more complete. There's no entry for 'love', and that's usually part of any fantasy novel. So, my main complaint is a lack of important entries. Also, the entries that do exist often just point out a cliche and move on. Yes, we all know that the 'slender youth' is usually a girl in disguise. Is it really that entertaining to just read that fact? It's the clever comments accompanying the cliche that are entertaining, not just the cliche alone. The entries too often just list the cliches and are dull because of it."
5,Lighten up! This book is F-U-N-N-Y!,"I think most of the negative reviews are from people whose tongue is not inserted properly in their cheek.Really, guys, who goes around COUNTING cliches and who can really catch every single one when it all comes dowen to it. This book is full of wicked humor and a skewering look at fantasy not to be missed.True fans of any genre are the ones that can laugh at it. This book is great because it tells writers exactly what cliches to avoid and points out funny facts. (Come to think of it, when HAS a fantasy character, a serious heroic one, mind you, ever worn socks? Tell me if you know!)Read it, be prepared for initial indignation, then laughter then get on with your life and for heaven's sake don't count how many times these tired cliches have been used! It spoils all the fun"
3,OMT - too many,Travel guide to the fantasy land is a nice touch to the cliche`s in fantasy books.this is not a book it's a a Dictionary to many things/places you will encounter in your travles.some of the items are funny but many of them has many links to other items that misses the point of them all.And don't forget the OMT that almost 50% of the items has one.A nice addition to the fantasy collection. nice to show friends not more.
5,An Excellent Guide,"I'm sure the other patients at my chiropractor's office must have thought there was a nut in one of the rooms because I laughed loudly at so many entries. This is THE fantasy book to give to friends who don't want to read fantasy. They'll get the basic idea in fewer pages than most epics, and they'll probably enjoy it. (Just be prepared for smug looks the next time you're caught reading fantasy.) Ann E. Nichols"
3,Good book. Lacking some details,"As usual, books in this collection are well done. The text is clear and concise. The book is full of color pictures illustrating the text.This book covers all kind of hardware from simple nail to complex hinges.The ""catalog"" part of the book is well done. If covers a lot without getting too boring.I would have given it a 5 stars rating if the information on how to install the hardware was more detailed. If you already know how to install something, reading the text makes complete sense. If you don't it is sometimes difficult with the text alone to get a good idea of the process."
3,Okay to pass the time,"This was a light, and ultimately very forgettable read. I don't quite understand why it has received such positive reviews. The book is only average, at best. I found the prose to be rather weak, the characters not very interesting and the setting difficult to visualize. The plot was interesting, and quite original. It certainly did not end up going anywhere even close to the direction I expected it to. However, the ending felt very anti-climactic.It's an okay book to pass the time. Would make a fun book to read on a long plane journey or something like that. If you're interested in giving it a try, I recommend that you don't pay too much for it. It's not really worth it. I got my copy used from Amazon Marketplace, and am glad I didn't pay much. I would have been more critical with this review if I had paid more."
5,Great book - Buy a C5 Today!!,"As an avid vette fan since my teens, I finished this book in less than a week (I usually take months to read a book cover to cover). The C5 vette is a significant leap forward for chevy and it is amazing the car got built (read the book for the details!). You two may want to run out and spend $45k on a new vette for your garage after reading this book. I highly recommend it."
4,Very Good!,"For some reason this CD hasn't been released in the U.S.. It should be, this CD really rocks, best music that come out in some time. in a different time ""The Magic"" would have been a huge radio hit."
1,This well-meraning book is a mess and a waste of money,"Despite the large ad in the NYTimes, this book disappointed me grievously. It seems written by a high-schooler for high-schoolers: Limp, fuzzy prose; foggy history. A key name spelled variously; a century wrongly named; Avignon moved to northern France. A mess! I think the publisher is one of those self-publishing outfits. I should have been on my guard."
3,Non-practical issue,"All the routhines are rewritten for c++ and 0-index array sounds good to me. They replaced array with their own vector and matrix class and they also gave the solutions if you don't like their classes. You can read the first chaper of the book more about the class they used on their website.But be careful, if you use STL vector, you have to copy the data to NR vector, then call the routines. In other words, they are not compatible with each other. Either you hack into their sourceor you have to use at least two vector classes at the same time.I call the way they did neither Fortran style nor C++ style. Really deprice the value of the content."
2,Not as much as a step forward as the C version,"I have dipped into the C version of NR since it came out almost ten years ago. It has been very useful. Having recently got the C++ version I may have had unrealistically high expectations. It is a good book, but I don't judge that it is that much better from the C version. All modern C++ compilers accept C programs so you can still get the formidable benefits of NR without moving to this version. I particularly disliked the size of the header file in the C++ version. It has to be included in all code (or else write your own individual header files) and since it runs to many thousands of characters, surely it was obvious that no one would spend time entering it? A bad decision for the reader and user, but one that definitely encourages the purchase of the downloadable code package."
3,raven,"I found the book very interesting,as it caught my attention,this was suppose to be read when I was in school,funny it took me another forty years to complete"
3,Where is it?,I remember reading this poem over and over until there was no true meaning to the poem.i didnt fin the poem I was looking for bu I did find some of my favorite lines of Lenore.
1,"Wonderful original, but distracting editing.","No one anywhere can argue that ""The Raven"" is anything less than wonderful. I love E.A.Poe.HOWEVER, the editing in this is terrible, and very distracting. To be clear I'm not talking about a slight misspelling or a run-on sentence. This was poorly edited and poorly formatted. Do not waste your time or money on this. I got it for free, and that was too high a price. How very disappointing."
3,It was very interesting,"Sure, amybe I didn't really understand this poem, but who needs to? I loved the way the words sort of came off of the page and into your mind, and how it made you use your imagination in order to understand it. That made it all the more creepy. I'm not sure if the movie THE CROW was sort of based on the poem, but I know that it(the poem) is quoted, and that the movie was excellent."
5,Great Product,Purchased for my 3yr old for Halloween. He and everyone else loved the costume. Thanks for making his Halloween
4,Excellent Depiction of Savage War,Watching this video you can almost get into the head of a gureilla fighter. What he thinks when he finds his enemy in the gun sights. It also shows us the determination they have when faced with odds unlikly in there favour. There upheaval of society leads them to unrest and sometimes for the good many for the bad.
2,Not what I expected,This book did not give the info promised. It does not rate each product. Only gives a review of what something is. I was very disappointed with this book & do not recommend. Go get Baby bargains. It's been my bible!!
1,Not what I expected from Consumer Reports,"I was hoping for a format similar to their magazine with rating charts. But, it is more text with a few charts. It was more cumbersome than helpful and a waste of money.I have found that ""Baby Bargins"" is a great resource. Highly recommeded!!! I just got it a couple weeks ago and have saved money on a quality crib and it helped me to decide which stroller was a better option."
3,Helpful......sort of,"Book is very informative about most baby products but it really wasn't what I thought it would be. I was looking for a book rating all baby products. While it did rate some products, it did not rate many so it didn't really help me out too much."
4,cop that Sh** is right!!,"This Cd is HOT!!!! The beats are amazing as only Timberland can do. The flow of the whole album is good. With a cast of appearences by Beenie Man, Brandy, Wyclef, Missy, and Bubba Sparkxx. Songs like the Hit ""Indian flute"" appear on the cd as well as ""Cop that shi**"" with Missy. The 2 songs with Raje Shwari are bad ass, the Indian style beats are insane!!!The remix of ""Naughty Eye"" with Beenie Man is a great song. The original version I think is better. ""N 2 Da Music"" with Brandy is tight too. Over all the whole cd is good Tim and Magoo deliver a hit again!!! Pick it up today"
3,Under Construction,"Timbaland is one of the best producers in hip-hop nowadays and that do a certain extend becomes evident in this album. On the other hand, ""Under Construction 2"" creates a jolly mood and is pretty enjoyable all the way through. Unfortunately, neither the lyrical skill of Timbo, nor the ones of Magoo can astonish you any way. The lyrical content is again an issue if you are looking for a socially engaged album, because apart from ""Cop that S***"" the album does not have much of a message to send to the world. Still, a very enjoyable album, recommended not only to the Timbaland fanatics, but to all unpretentious rap listeners."
3,"Interesting, but not a book you can't put down","It's nice to learn about the situation in Latin America in such a microcosmal type of way, but the book tends to go on and on sometimes, not always fascinating. A lot of the stories about individual Bolivian women are very interesting. Again, it's interesting to learn about someting so small, domestic servants in Bolivia, that can be applied to something so big, the entire country of Bolivia, or for that matter many socially startified countries."
1,trashed it,This is a revised version of a product that I used to really like. This 'improved' version was horribly salty and abrasive. Used it a few times and then threw it in the trash.
2,The New Simply Gargle,"A few years ago I tried Simply Gargle. I liked it very much and have been looking for it. I found it on line and ordered this. I do not care for the form or amount of liquid there is to gargle. Some one came up with this new form or design with the twist off tab. There is simply not enough to get a good gargle going and it doesn't taste good. If you ever come out with the old form again, I would certainly buy it.-Mrs. Jacks"
3,Salt water rinse,"There have been times when dentists have recomended rinsing with salt water. I'm not a dentist but there is a good use for this product and it is very convenient. If you are in need of this, I would consider buying this item."
5,A Great Alternative to Over the Counter Meds,"With the recent removal of some over the counter medications for children's cold symptoms, I was looking for alternative cold and allergy treatments for me and my family. I found Simply Gargle to be an effective early treatment for sore throats and coughs. In two instances where I felt a cold coming on, I used this product and the sickness never took hold. The product was also effective for my children's allergies. At first, I was a little put off by the unexpected orange color of the product, but the taste is pleasant and it is easy to use the single serving plastic packets. This is a good natural alternative treatment...well worth the price."
5,works as promised,"had an ""issue"" -- snaked the clog through the septic. re-cloged each time. Used this through an inlet and problem solved. saved hundreds."
5,this game rocks,"let me put it simply: this game is amazing. basically, in the game you are either a terrorist or a counter-terrorist trying to complete various objectives depending on the map-such as bombing something, rescuing hostages, or the most fun one: eliminating the other side. the weapons are all real-life and just realistic enough to be fun but not annoying (ex: extreme recoil is very perturbing). this game is definitely one of the best ever, even though the graphics are a bit bad because of its age(which really doesn't matter) get this game if you have a fast internet connection, otherwise it will probably be choppy and not fun. also, there are thousands of servers running cs(i recommend homelan servers) and always tens of thousands of people playing, no matter what time it is(time seems not to exist when playing!). Otherwise, this game is constant action and strategy blended perfectly. the sequel, counter-strike:condition zero, will be released in august 2002, definitely get it!"
5,It's GGRRRRRREAT!!,"This game is great! It combines strategy w/ fun and exitement.The different levels & weapons keep it interesting. If u r bored, with this game hanging around, it'll keep u busy 'till dinner!"
5,My Time To Review...,"Ok. I've been a gaming fan for a long long long time. I bought half life when it came out, and i heard about this new game called counter-strike. So after a while, I bought it and started playing. I got so frusterated at first because it was NOTHING like the other first person shooters i've played. But thats because its LIFELIKE! After a while, you learn how to stay out of the middle of gunfights and play a tactical, skillful game. After a week or so of practice, you'll see why counter strike is one of the best games in existence. If you like life-like games. GET THIS! If you don't.. STILL GET IT! It is great! You will become addicted like me."
1,"Great Game, horrible product","Counter strike is an amazing game, but this version is out of date and unstable. Avoid it at all costs. You will spend hours updating and you'll be lucky to get this game to run at all."
1,don't buy this game if you don't have half-life,"first of all this is a multi player game no single player. I just found out that you need half life to play it(which i don't have). Anyway it installed nicely i did trainig and then looked for campaign mode but of course it's not there. then i tried multi player i checked for servers and it said something like this ""we are sorry could not find any data"" after i did it a couple times it finally let me get servers but there WEREN'T ANY, ARRRGGG. So i tried training again and it froze before i got in so i uninstalled and reinstalled tried again with the same result. i tried to load a saved spot in training but it takes me to the last 3 seconds in the game and then a c4 blows me up. i know it sounds funny at first but try doing that over 20 times! So i uninstalled it again and threw it in the garbage but my dad took it out. I'm too late to return this trash don't be like me -- buy the call of dutys or the medal of honors, etc. Just dont buy this game!"
5,"Great fun, addictive, excellent","This is a excellent game, I love playing it, its kinda of addictive, youll love it."
4,Fantastic Action,"Counter-Strike is a fantastic, reality-themed, goal-oriented first-person-shooter. Its gameplay is neither simulation nor arcade, but a lovely mix of the two. On the one hand, all your weapons have a real-life counterpart and you have to take into account things like recoil and movement when aiming. But on the other hand, you don't have to worry about irritating things like bandaging wounds or bleeding. If you want to play a boring simulation, go get Rogue Spear. If you want to play a repetitive shooter, get Quake III. If you want a game that offers fast action and harrowing close-calls, get Counter-Strike. But don't buy this. This is the ""retail"" version. Go buy Half-Life (a tremendous game in and of itself) and download the ""mod version.""BTW - The only reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 is because CS has slowly been making its way over to the simulation side of things. It used to be much more fun than it currently is."
4,Enjoyable Light Reading .-),"Transcripts of a series of lectures given by W.E.Butler in a thought provoking and very entertaining style.Being a member of the Liberal Catholic Church myself,it was a bit of a surprise to find out he was a priest in the very same Church,and made reading it (for me anyway) all the more interesting.Although,I would have to say,it may not be everybody's cup of tea."
1,Not the same item as promised in the picture....,"While the item will fit my 8985 razor, it is not the ""older"" blades as the picture shows. Instead, it's the ""newer"" version which doesn't last as long. I found this out after I replaced my blades about a year and a half ago. The good shave only lasted about 3 months. I'll use these newer blades again (since the older ones are almost impossible to find) but I won't be enjoying it."
1,Planters Warped: Could Not Assemble,"Bought 2 planters to replace exact same ones purchased 15 years ago. Plastic sides were obviously warped, possibly stored a long time. Could not assemble even with tools, time, patience. Returned."
3,Technodog,"Smoked Swiss Cheese 3 lb.The service was very prompt as it was with my first order. As in my other reviews I've stated that I felt that the smoked Swiss was outstanding, but was a bit disappointed with the Cheddar. Although not a bad product or anything, I'll purchase a different brand the next time. Be sure and try their smoked Swiss however, you can't go wrong with that!"
3,Could be better,"Although Humongous does a great job, there should be some changes. After a couple months my 4 year old is starting to get bored with this one. The same items are always needed and they're always in the same place. Unlike Travels through Time, which my daughter still plays after a year, the items are in different places and you have to listen closely to the clues each time. I hope that newer products will be better, not just different."
4,Not to shabby,"I bought this case because it looks durable and I like that it came in green which is the color of me Zen. It's very durable, leather, easy to clean and dust and dirt doesn't stick to it like those rubber cases which I hate. It also has a stiff leather belt hook which for me, is alot more comfortable and less bulky than those wierd little plastic ones which I'm great at destroying. The buttons on the Zen are still easy to work through the case which I was worried about since some other customers said that was a problem. I thankfully did not have this problem at all. The only reason I gave this case a 4 and not a 5 is because the pics make it look like you can use the flap like a stand if you snap it shut from behind. I thought that would be neat; I could prop it up to watch movies or whatever, so I tried to do that and it did not work at all, which is a shame. Either way I still like the case and if I ever destroy this one I would definity replace with the same one."
1,Poor Poor Product,"I bought my daught a Aiwa CD player and like the other commentsmade the CD changer quit after a year. Went to get it fixed and therepairman stated he is seeing alot of these all with the same problem. he recommended to stay away from this product. Take his advice. I wish I would of known this earlier. Yes it is cheap for what you get, but it will only last a few months and then you need to go and but something else."
1,AIWA MALFUNCTION,"I've had my Aiwa for no more than a year before I began havingproblems with it. I loved it so much I dust it everyday. Now, itdoesn't play cds. The cds just spin without any music from the system..."
3,Adequate system for a nice price,"The main influence on my purchase of this system was the cost. I was unable to find a system with half the power for the price. The system has a good, clear, room filling sound. As well, it makes an excellent starer system for a home theatre. However, I was dissapointed with the FM and AM reception. As well, I would suggest the purchase of a subwoofer for anyone seeking serious bass response from this unit."
3,"Good facts, good read","I think this was a well documented book. I was very impressed with the details of the accounts of different events which took place throughout. I think the author did a decent job of balancing the art of telling a story the the science of presenting factual information. At times the chronology of the book was hard to follow. The author goes from one time frame to another at times as a opposed to a steady progression from the past to the future. Overall, I think this is a good book and I would recommend it to anyone looking for insignt about organized crime & social networks in general"
2,Not worth the trouble,"i could not get through this book . It seemed to go back in forth in time with random stories of violence with so many differant characters , it was hard to keep up with who was doing what ."
4,This is a Gang,"You know I get real tired of hearing old timers talking about the "" good ole days"",and how we had respect.Why they lying? I spent a lot of time talking to my old heads up in Philly and to tell the truth, you had cats doing they thing that never even get mention in the book. The big gunners were on the down low. Anyways its all Gangsta. Many rehabilitated themselves and are good peoples.These cats were dangerous and politically connected. The moral of the story is, you aint hustlin in Philly unless someone extortin you, or you just big like that. All of that NOI righteous stuff(lol) come on now. They never were real Muslims untill after 75' when they started heading towards orthodox Islam. NOI always been a gang. My old head told me in the 1940's he was recruited to rob for them. Good book, but very vital details were left out as well. It could have been an Encyclopedia set."
1,Not much ear training in this book,"The title of this book is misleading. Apparently academics use the term ""Ear Training"" for the entire set of skills associated with sight reading music. The specific skills amateurs might associate with the term, hearing and recognizing intervals etc. are only a part of that and represent less that a quarter of the text of this book. I'm not qualified to judge how good this book is in the other areas it covers but as a text focused on ear training in specific it was a disappointment. What little there was wasn't very useful to me."
5,Good book!,"I enjoyed this book and all the vivid pictures and statistics it has. Here, we are given a different side of Tijuana that the popular media doesn't shows us. This book presents cultural, artistic and social aspects of Tijuana that even those of us that are familiar with the city may not know about. Well done!"
4,Saving Your Brain,"Excellent resource. Would like to see an update though. Much of the research was from 2002, I'd like to hear the results of the many promising treatments highlighted. Most importantly, I'd like to hear the newest promising treatments."
4,"Great movie, fun extras","My daughter and I love this movie. Though she hates DVD extras. Fortunately, I love them and these were fun. Highly recommend the movie and the DVD version!"
5,One of my fav movies!,"Big fan of this movie, watched it A LOT of times in my younger years, VHS taped it from the times it aired in HBO. Loved the EXTENDED CUT. Had never seen it and those extra scenes were great. The only CON is that I bought it in the States and it won't play in my Latinamerican DVD player, but I knew there was that possibility because of that zoning BS."
4,Rick Elias and Guy's love for jazz,"Normally a solo artist and member of Rich Mullins' Ragamuffin Band, Rick Elias and his wife Linda wrote the majority of the performed songs in this movie. He even has a cameo role, playing guitar for the Vegas-suited band that tours with and introduces The Wonders. This is a very good, but not entirely great, movie. My only deep regret is Tom Hanks cutting short the absolutely mesmerizing duet at the end of the show with Guy and Del Paxton. I've rewound and played that scene about a hundred times. Guy's respect for ""good"" Jazz as a recurring theme throughout the movie is its driving force. If for no other reason, see the movie for that reason."
3,That Thing You Do,"For some reason, the movie skips in a few places. I was happy with the service in receiving the movie quickly but we believe something is wrong with the DVD."
4,Great Boots,"I needed some brown work boots for my summer job, and they needed to be cheap. Where to go?? Amazon! I really like the look of these boots, the fit, the sole is grippy--the only thing I would recommend to get with these boots is a pair of inserts because there is not much heel support. One last thing--one of the little metal links that holds the shoelaces feel off right after I wore them for a day, but all was well because I just stuck the shoelace through the hole which was underneath the little metal thing. Overall, great boots for the price."
1,"Yard-Man 12A-469P701 6.5, 21 in 3N1 Self-Propelled Mower","Amazon sent me a 2003 model, that had two wheels damaged and yellow hubs missing. Had to order from the Manufacture and they did not send a hub cap. Found the 2005 model for $259.00 at Home Depot and Amazon will not honor there low price Guarentee, they said look at the fine print. I ordered the mower from Amazon at work, and if I waited until after work and bought the mower I would have had a fully functional product for $40.00 less and it would have been a 2005 product."
1,"Fast delivery, but sprays oil","It arrived quickly, but the oil cap was broken. I tried running it in this state but it sprays oil everywhere and smokes alarmingly. I don't have a car that it fits in, so now I'm having to pay the local service agent to pick it up."
1,Doesn't pull a tight vaccume.,"This is not a good product. It does not pull a very tight vacuum and a five dollar plastic model from the grocery store will do a better job. Granted it is pretty, but other than that, it's pretty worthless. Also, the handle broke off the device when pumping one time, fortunately I was able to repair it and still use it, but I think I would have been happier if it had broke and could then purchase something else.Do not purchase this product unless you want your wine to go bad."
4,ready to customize,Just what I was looking for since I will have it professionally airbrushed and it is a blank canvas ready to go. Nicely weighted so it won't tip over. The head and pompom both bobble. It comes with a set of acrylic paints in several colors and a paint brush.
1,Yawnfest At Best,"Don't believe the hype on here, this is just another b grade film that should have been made with a bigger budget, makes you crave for the 70's Gargoyles film that Stan Winston did the effects on, at least that was scary and well made.So may I suggest you buy that film instead, don't waste your time or money on this one."
5,Sacred,"This book was great. Not the best in the series. Darkness Take My Hand is the best, with this following. Lehane is a great writer. Makes you not want to put the book down. He really knows how to keep your attention."
4,Nice little spray gun for backyard projects,"Bought this to spray interior doors during a remodel. I have a 120 max PSI Husky air compressor, which actually made it hard to find spray guns of any quality that would be compatible with my compressor (used mainly for airbrushing). The Campbell spray gun did the job nicely. While I'm pretty familiar with spray guns and compressors, the gun was easy to set up and use, and I would assume it would be just as easy for someone with no experience with spray guns.The gun comes with extra tips and clear instructions, as well as cleaning oil and necessary tightening tools. Easy to use, easy to clean. I have no complaints and am glad I purchased this. I probably would not try to use this to paint very large projects, say, the interior of a house or siding, but would be fine for baseboards, doors, trim, playhouses, fences, and other similarly sized projects."
5,such an amazing costume...too bad it was too small,"Such a bummer that this didn't fit my 7-mo old by the time Halloween came around, because it's the best costume ever. Fyi, it's a bunting - no holes for the feet. She was just too big for it. But if I ever have a newborn at Halloween, it's going to wear this. I almost cut holes in it just bc it was so cute, but the fabric is just plain crafting felt, and I was afraid it would fall apart if I cut it."
4,"Fake ""letterboxing"" gives you less image. Story remains great.","For some reason, the DVD producers have decided to make this into a ""widescreen"" presentation. But this is not a widescreen film. It is a t.v. movie made in 1988. It was shot at an aspect ratio of 1.33 to 1 (a perfect fit for your standard t.v. screen). The result of the modification is that you see LESS of the image. They simply cropped off the top and bottoms of the picture. You can see that this is NOT how ""Noble House"" was meant to be seen at the very beginning: the credits feature medallions of the actors faces along with their names, and the tops of the medals (and the tops of the actors' heads) are CUT OFF. Also, now, several shots look crowded.That aside, everything else is great. The image (what's left of it) is sharp and clear. The story remains fascinating and the acting top notch. It's a great tale of international intrigue and finance. (And, oh, those 80s fashions!)"
5,Noble House,"Noble House is a beautifully filmed and beautifully cast mini-series made from James Clavell's book of the same name. It is highly entertaining with Pierce Brosnan as the 'Tai-Pan', and John Rhys-Davis as the perfect rival. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
4,Stood the test of time,"I remembered watching this years and years ago when it was first shown on television, so I wasn't sure how it would stand the test nearly 20 years later. As it turned out I enjoyed it, didn't regret buying it, and don't feel the need to hide it at the back of my collection."
2,"Great story, lousy technical quality","This applies to a new tape. The story is great but the technical quality is awful. The tape, made in 1988, has squeezed 355 minutes of playing time into a 240 minute cassette by reducing the thickness of the tape. The result is extremely faded colors and occasional static. If this caused by the tape's age or thickness I am not in a position to say. If the reduced thickness is the cause then two cassettes is the obvious solution. I assume that when a DVD is issued the technical quality will have been rectified. I have placed a preorder for a DVD."
1,Not Brown Nubuck!,"The shoes pictured are brown nubuck(suede)-just what I wanted. The shoes I received were brown leather - not at all what I wanted. Shoeflake was very prompt in refunding my payment, but I was very disappointed not to get what I ordered, and annoyed by the waste of my time involved in reporting the error, sending back the incorrect merchandise and waiting for a refund."
3,Surprising for Fluke,"An Allen wrench is needed to switch the head around from the cut to the flush side. A small ball bearing rolls out while doing this. It's surprising how much of a pain it is for a Fluke product. I love the company, but for $180 this needs to be addressed and fixed."
3,FUNNY GAME!,"WELL,THIS IS A CHANGE FROM THE MILLIONAIRE SERIES...YOU CAN TAKE TURNS BEATING MONEY OUT OF MILLIONAIRES,THE HARDER THE QUESTIONS ARE,THE HARDER THE PUNCH,BUT MAN! SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE TOUGH,TOUGH,TOUGH! AND OCASIONALLY,IT THROWS IN A QUESTION THAT MAKES ZERO SENSE,BUT MAKES YOU LAUGH! FUNNY GAME,VERY INSULTING HOST. NEEDS A SCOREBOARD."
2,"Cute teapot, poor packing/shipping.","I bought this teapot recently. It is supposed to come in a ""stylish gift box"" but did not come in a box at all. Inside the amazon box it was just wrapped in bubble wrap, which was a disappointment. Furthermore, the teapot was missing its lid. When I contacted Amazon they said that they could not send me a new lid. I had to return the teapot and they would send me a new one. Their next email said that the teapot was out of stock so I could take a $5 refund and keep the teapot (with no lid) or simply return it. Now I have no teapot. All in all, had it been packed properly (with the lid and in the box that is advertised) it would have been a very cute teapot."
2,Meh,Not my kind of heroine. I skipped paragraphs on occasion to keep my eyes from rolling too much. I was not impressed with the Dirk and Steele organization either.
5,Book soon to become game!,"Not only is this book the incredible start to Marjorie's Dirk & Steele series, it is also the basis of a computer game that allows you to see the characters and tour their world! (Look to [...] for info on that.) While Marjorie continues with this fantasy series, she's also the author of the Hunter Kiss series, an intensely involved story with magic and demons which is also well worth checking out."
5,Great start to a series,A somehow very oriental story about a were tiger trapped in puzzle box by an evil magician. Dela buys the box and inadvertently frees Hari at least temporarily. Well done plot and an interesting collection of paranormal talents masquerading as a detective agency. Of course a dragon is involved and we have a verity of compelling well drawn characters. Nicely done erotic scenes without the explicit sex that has come to too often clutter up the genre.Outstanding read.
3,Another shapeshifter romance,"Another impossibly-handsome-I'm-tormented hero rescued by the scrappy-and-beautiful heroine. It's adequate to pass the time, but neither one was unique or interesting enough to make me want to buy the rest of the series. Give me Patricia Briggs or Anne Bishop, any day."
5,Entertainment to the max!,"That's why I read novels, to be entertained, and what a fantastic read Tiger Eye was! A tough, resilient, capable heroine and one severely HOT hero. (I want a Hari of my own.) I loved coming along on the wild ride that was Marjorie Liu's debut book. And having been in Beijing many times, I can vouch for the accuracy of the author's descriptions of the city, except, darn it, no one's ever tried to sell me a puzzle box! If you love the paranormal, characters you can root for, and an involving storyline, then this book's for you."
1,"Oh no, the action stopped and they're having ANOTHER long-winded conversation.","I absolutely love Marjorie Liu's Hunter Kiss books. Dark, beautiful prose. That said, this book is so different it's as though it was written by a different author. There are small spurts of interesting action that pull the plot along... only to be mired down a page later with too much repetitive dialogue. I really wanted to like the main character Dela Reese and her love interest Hari, but after the umpteenth overwrought conversation about her protection, safety, and emotional well-being... ugh. This book became a tiresome mess. Also, I bought this as a Kindle edition and it's jam-packed full of typos. Annoying."
1,A disappointing book,"I picked this book based on the positive reviews on Amazon, but sadly was disappointed that I wasted money on it. The auther is, certainly, passionate about gardening in the mid-west, and her interest is clear. But, as a useful guide for creating a yard, it's not so good - it's a random stream of thoughts, and I did not find the photos to be the least bit helpful. There are so many better choices for books on mid-west gardening. Save your money."
2,Did Not Atomize Well,I bought this to replace the gun that came with my CH 3500 HVLP system. The original replacement gun was over $200 so I opted for the less expensive one. I have over 20 years experience finishing furniture in my opinion I did not like the way it atomized the material I sprayed. I thinned the material and warmed slightly as I usually do for good atomiation. Nice touch coming with two different sized needles.
4,Tiny prongs,"I ordered two CZ wedding ring sets and this one is by far the better of the two. The main CZ is very pretty and has a lot of fire, but the band is poorly crafted and does not look as nice as the encrusted CZ's around the solitaire. The four prongs on the solitaire are dinky, giving it more of a phony feel, considering the main CZ is large and would require a more hardy prong setting (if it was genuine). Time will tell if the rodium plating holds up but overall it does look like white gold. I am a fine jewelry fan so I may be just a bit nit picky considering the price and materials. Overall not a bad ring for the price."
2,Are we falling apart??,"I had to read this in high school, thought it was interesting and maybe possible (people not being able to handle rapid change), but now it's 38 years later...well, where are all the people coming apart at the seams cause of technological change? We seem to handle it no prob, and plenty of people still lead simple lives if they want to, it just didn't happen Alvin, sorry, but you keep on self-promoting, this is America after all.."
3,"Plausible in 1970, but dated now........","I read this book in 1975 while in 7th grade and thought it was awesome. However, the future ""Shock"" has failed to materialize as predicted.Almost all of the technological changes that really changed society happenned from 1850-1950. If you took a person from the developed world in 1950 (let alone 1970, the date of this book) and plopped them in 2004, they'd have little trouble adapting. Air travel, telephones, radio, TV, etc. would all be completely familair......... Even much ballyhooed technology such as the Internet or cell phones are easily understood and refinements of older technologies.....Now take someone from 1850 and drop them in 1950.....That would be a Future Shock!"
2,Skip the Kindle Edition,"This is not a beginners learn to draw book. The instruction is on how to take your drawing practice out in the field. Claudia's artwork is beautiful. I have both a print copy and the Kindle edition. I got the Kindle edition for inspiration while traveling but the Kindle edition is worthless. The images are small and very low res. The actual book is larger than a standard sheet of paper but the digitized images are a couple of inches tall and are blurry when you zoom in. Most of the text in this book is done in Claudia's calligraphic hand, so that is also part of the low-res blurry image. NorthLight needs to step up on formatting their art books for digital readers."
4,My daughter loves this,"And so do I! Very cute, the one side falls off but I just snap it back on. I only wish that it included a couple of tutus or some kind of dress up clothes for the ponies in the dressing/ vanity area. I remember this little pony boutique they had out when I was little and it had hats and shoes. Regardless, good toy."
2,Fell apart first minute out of box,"This was the one thing my dd wanted for Christmas. Found it on sale but still a little miffed at the fact that the sides broke off the second it was opened. The case doesn't stay closed when you carry it because of this. When you open it to play, you have to lean it on something because the top is so heavy it falls backwards. My dd still loves it a bunch so I didn't have the heart to return it...I wanted to real bad. She also got the Cotton Candy Cafe and the Salon and so far they've been ok. But I think that's because they are small and open up to only 2 sides and nothing fancy.All and all, I would not recommend this toy and would return it in a heartbeat if dd wouldn't be crushed. Too bad, because it's real cute."
3,Great stories not so good quality,I have read all of the Cadfael books. The stories are great. Derek Jacobi is great as Cadfael. The rest of the cast is done very well. My main complaint is that the DVD transfer from VHS is very muddy. Acorn studios just took the VHS tapes and put them on DVD. They also did that with Miss Marple and other series.
2,European Disc Format,"The DVD's were in European format, which means I cannot play on my Blue Ray and have to use my computer which is inconvenient. It would have been nice to know that ahead of time."
2,Complete Series on Prime? NOT!,"I was so excited to see that the complete series was on Amazon Prime. Until I found out that it was only the first 4 episodes of the complete series. Amazon needs to get all the episodes into prime or break them up by episode. I loved this when it was on PBS Mystery, and would love to watch the rest of them again. I'd give it 5 stars if this is fixed."
5,Great Cadfael,"Cadfael is a wonderful series to watch. Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed watching them and wished there were more in the series. I would highly recommend this series for entertainment and for educational purposes--learning about the middle ages. Buy the whole series--not one at a time. It is sooo good, it is hard to wait to watch the next episode."
3,Gidget Collection,"I rated the Gidget Collection a 3 star.I forgot that Sandra Dee was only in the original Gidget. Deborah Wally was the second Gidget and the third woman was forgetable.Clif Robertson is still fabulous as the Kahuna, as is Bobby Darren.....as Moondoggie. It brings me back to my own life growing as a tomgirl and surfing the beaches of Hawaii..."
3,Hmm,"These were 3 great movies that got horrible DVD release. I mean I bought the DVD set because it was better than nothing. But still Columbia House should have given these 3 glorious films the respect they rightfully deserved, I mean why couldn't they release it in Widescreen format. The first movie in the set gets a 1 disc release that isn't double sided. It is the best Gidget movie of them all. The 1959 Film Gidget which Sandra Dee, James Darren, and Arthur O'Connell. Which was the best ever. Than comes Gidget Goes Hawaiian. With Deborah Walley, Michael Callan, James Darren, and Carl Reiner. Then the last Gidget Film, Gidget Goes To Rome, which starred Cindy Carroll as Gidget, James Darren in his last role as Moondoggie, and Don Porter as Gidgets father, who played Gidgets father in the 60's TV Series Gidget which starred Sally Fields as Gidget. Which Gidget Goes To Rome, also stars the beautiful Jessie Royce Landis, as the funny guardian. The movies are great, but the set was ick."
3,Fun & Light,Gidget is best for young girls. The movie is light meaning easy to watch nothing bad happens. It should not be taken seriously. Just a movie to watch when it is raining or for a girls night out.
1,Less Than Stellar Set,"Not only did they put a Cinemascope film in a ""Full Frame"" dvd, but again, they put 3 movies together that should be sold separately (for those who disliked the second and third movies like me) or in a collector's box set. Sandra Dee was the best, and in my opinion, the only Gidget. The second and third movies were just horrible! Yes they have James Darren back as Moondoggie, but why not bring back Sandra Dee if they were going to make sequels? Save your money, this set is not worth buying.If you want to see Gidget in all its original beauty and not hacked to pieces like on this dvd set, tune into TCM they play it occasionally."
3,Not for everyone,"Unless you are in your fifties or older you will not enjoy this kind of movies. Nevertheless you can enjoy some beautiful scenes in the movies of Rome and the lovely Hawaiian beaches for surfing. If you like Sandra dee, this will be perfect."
1,more full frame crop from Sony,"I don't understand why Sony, the company that makes widescreen HD TV's, would release their catalog titles (originally shot in 1.85 and 2.35 aspect ratio) on DVD in 1.33 Full Frame... the ""Gidget"" movies, ""Trouble with Angels"", ""Living Free"", ""Perfect"".... the list goes on and on. Why bother? Sony's Electronics division and Home Video Entertainment division need to talk to one another."
3,Columbia Tri-Star just doesn't care,"The other viewers are correct in lambasting Columbia Tri-Star for releasing these pictures (not to mention Roz as Mother Superior) in pan-and-scan full-frame. But it is not merely for the original ""Gidget"" that this matters; ""Gidget Goes Hawaiian"" is delightful as well and features some snappy production numbers. Columbia put itself to no expense apparently in doing the DVD transfer, since it looks like the same unrestored, sometimes dirty print as the VHS issue was used. Even so, it doesn't look half as bad as some pan-and-scan jobs and for many who encountered this picture first on TV, the full-screen will at least look ""normal."""
1,No INK!,"I have had this printer only 3 months. I don't print very much but now when I need ink, it's run out! Okkkkkkkk, I go shopping for an ink cart. Can I find one? Not a Black one! I have looked everywhere online and cannot find the black ink #c6614A ANYWHERE! And Although I did find a close match to the color cart. The desc. does not list the Deskjet 612C as a model that uses it. BEWARE BUYER! What good is a printer with NO INK?"
2,VOICEOF THE BLOOD,"I LIKED THE STORY AND CONNECTED WITH THE CHARACTERS. IT IS A BOOK THAT DELVES INTO THE UNDERBELLIE OF LIFE. THE LANGUAGE IS GUTTERAL AND CRASS. I JUDGE IT HARSH IN SOME RESPECTS SINCE I'VE READ SOME ROMANCE VAMPIRE NOVELS SOME HAVE HAVE ROMANCE DESCRIPED INSTEAD OF USING FU.. CU.. DI.. COULD HAVE BEEN FLESHED OUT MORE, DID NOT LIKE ENDING."
5,Favorite Book When I Was Little,When I was little my mom used to read me this book all the time. It was my favortie book and I highly recommend it.
1,It is misleading...,"The category is Jacquard Activators and Agents. The product is just the 5lbs of Soda Ash, which is necessary for dying and works fine. This title and total lack of description are entirely misleading."
3,cult flick needs a dvd release.,"This little horror flick has alot of charm and is creepy to be sure. What's really cool is that they shot it at a mountain town in UTAh, although the story takes place in colorado for some reason. However I couldn't tell the difference and I live in colorado. IT's a fun flick with decent effects and the acting is good too. With several mainstream actors. And yes there's even a line where a character says : 'IT's the boogens!' If you are a horror snob who has to have todays cgi effects and superfast jarring pacing then perhaps you may not get how fun this one is. But I love older horror and this one deserves to be out on dvd too , doubled with another flick if possible. The print looks good on this but vhs is a dead medium because it's picture quality is limited compared to dvd severely. And of course blu ray is three times better than that. Someone needs to put out boxsets of lots of these little horror flicks on blu ray , or three to a disc would help."
3,The Boogens,"The Boogens, despite its name, is a well paced horror film which pays justice to the cult monster movies of the 1950's. The editing style gives the viewer a well balanced blend of suspense, shock and gore to make the film both eerie and frightening. I originally saw this movie on cable about 18 years ago and was equally entertained after watching the VHS copy I recently purchased. The ""Boogens,"" themselves, are a bit cheesy looking and were designed after a sheep's brain with slashing tenticles for legs (I learned this from the make up effects person in charge of creating the creatures for this film). The directing coupled with the editing style are what save this movie by giving us only a glimpse of the the creatures, keeping us on the edge of our seat for the majority of the film. This is one of the few real monster movies that are a credit to the monster genre.I know 3 stars may not seem like much but only the best films are worthy of 4 and above."
4,Scared for years,"I was dating in high school when I saw this movie at the local drive-in. It scared me so much that I slept with my mother for a week...and never attempted to see it again. It is now 21 years later and I have never forgotten the title or the entire movie...it is vivid in my mind. I am going to purchase it, watch it again to see if my more mature mind will be as scared as the kid left in me. Mind you, I am not a slasher movie fan, and this was perfect. Just enough suspense without the gore. A must see for those of you that wish to be scared for years..."
5,Awesome!,I loved watching this 80's horror flick! It has a good story and the actors were great! I am so happy I purchased it! Have already watched it twice over the weekend......what a life...LOL! It really was good though :)
4,Good History and Faith Story,I purchased this book for my pilgrimage to Assisi. It was a perfect companion to touring as a Catholic Pilgrim to the many sites within Assisi. The book goes beyond Assisi to a few places St. Francis and Claire were. This is not a typical tour book (no hours/costs/restaurants) but the city is so small that it doesn't seem necessary. What is necessary is to give context and background to the reason people visit Assisi. THe Life of St. Francis and St. Claire.
2,A Missed Opportunity,"The idea for this new edition of the Bible was great; however, the result is a disappointment. The text is not easy to read. The font size is too small. The margin white space should have been used to increase the font size or less text should have been put on each page. It seems that no one took a good look at the final product in terms of the book's readability."
2,I tried to like this movie...,"I hoped this movie would be better than the other reviews say it is. No, it isn't. And I tried to like it. The acting is bad, and not just in places. The story loses focus, and, as a viewer, I got lost out of boredom. The effects are... non-existent. I thought this technique was a clever low-budget tactic, but they used it for EVERY effects moment. Some moments in the cinematography showed promise. The pacing of the movie is very slow and tedious, though."
3,decent beginner guide,"This is a slim, question-and-answer style book that deals with some basic, seemingly puzzling, behaviors exhibited by dogs, explaining the biological and psychological reasons behind them in clear understandable language. This is by no means a comprehensive overview of dog behavior, and is best recommended for the reader with a casual interest in the subject."
5,The Ghostly Lover strikes deep and true.,"The Ghostly Lover tracks the shifting currents of the emotions, thoughts, and observations of it's characters with terrific precision and care. Elizabeth Hardwick is so sensitive to the curves of our moods, how a frown or a passing reminiscence can send us spinning elsewhere. We are so immersed in the minds and hearts of the characters that it is hard to wake up from the book and not experience the world as they would. An upper middle-class Kentucky family, lost in themselves, the young daughter desparate to break from the strictures of niceties and surface-skimming chit chat, but with no model to learn from save the black maid, whom she idolizes for her brutality and rawness. This book had a huge effect on me. It inspired me to observe with the same sensitivity my own heart and others around me...as well as the tiny details of the world around us. If you read this, please write me and tell me what you thought. I can't stop thinking about it."
2,not worth the cost of shipping,"The bottle is barely bigger than that of the tabasco source and it tastes like something I could have made up myself, felt a bit cheated considering the shipping cost is twice the cost of the item. You porbably can get soemthing better on the supermarket shelf."
5,Raunchy historical romp,"Love this series and an eagerly awaiting the final season DVD due to ship at the end of October 2010. Great costumes, dialog, debauchery, and peek behind the historical era of Henry VIII. If only history courses could have been brought to life in this manner, it would've been everyone's favorite subject."
2,Poor book,"This book will stuff you with many rules of the C# 2.0, but lamentably it does not teach how to use them. The programs are short and poor. Definitively this is not the form to teach a beginner how a programming language must be used. And the book doesn't explain the differences between C# 1.0 and C# 2.0, except a short chapter about generics."
5,Transports the reader back to a time of war and danger,"My Carrier War: The Life And Times Of A Naval Aviator In WW II is a gripping memoir of Norman E. Berg, who was a pilot-in-training and earned his wings three days after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. In addition to recounting harrowing battles, My Carrier War also explores the author's inner conflicts and chronicles a young couple's efforts to balance military duty with commitment and love. Black-and-white photographs illustrate the powerful, evocative text. A memoir so strong it transports the reader back to a time of war, danger, and uncertainty, when the fate of America and the world was at stake, My Carrier War is a very welcome contribution to the growing library of World War II memoirs and autobiographies."
1,Dissapointed,"We had all the Little People VHS and DVDs except this one, so I was excited to finally be bringing it home. My daughter (now 26 months) has been hooked on Little People episodes since she was 6 months old! But this particular DVD was dissapointing. Because half of the episodes are simply summaries of past LP shows. It doesn't hold my daughter's attention because she's seen it before. It was a waste - I was looking for something fresh and new to show her and all we found was a replay of her other already owned episodes. :("
3,Good mix of songs - Good Covers to classic ballads,"In this two-CD set, there is a decent mix of both Tagalog and English songs. The English songs are mostly all covers to classic R&B and pop ballads, which are done well. For a two-person group, they come off sounding well and producing some relaxing music."
2,"BAD CD-CHANGER, GREAT SOUND!","It is all good except for a few things: the fm receptor is in the back of the stereo sytem and must be pulled out all the way to receive it the clearest, the cd changer is extremely slow and makes alot of noise, also when theres no cds in there it searches through each dics holder, it takes alot of time and wastes alot of power. Other than that the sound is great, the look is nice, theres a nice and simple remote, and contains all the features of a stereo system!"
3,Solución práctica,La diferencia entre usar esto a usar cinta es la ventaja de poder quitar y poner los gel pads en cualquier posición en el tambor. No tienen la misma respuesta pero ayudan a corregir los problemas comunes. Buena opción pero no es la mejor solución.
3,"Good for the kids, annoying for adults!","Well, my child has enjoyed this video for a couple of years. I am very particular about the kinds of shows I let my children watch, and this video does fit the bill as far as being sweet and wholesome and very geared towards innocent young minds. It is also somewhat educational. For all of those reasons I say it is a good video for little ones to watch. I could show it to any child without fear of their parent disapproving of any of the content. I can turn it on and let my own children watch it without any concerns. The trouble is, the video is also very corny. The characters are very annoying. The adults seem to be more immature than the children. And the story lines go beyond imaginative to being silly. While there are several childrens' shows and videos that I personally like and even enjoy, these one really drives me crazy. I am glad that others like it because it is so very kid-friendly."
1,here comes my baby,"3 cd's, 82 songs, 2 great songs and 80 that are awful.what a shame, here comes my baby and silince is golden are so good.sould have been able to come up with some better cuts."
2,Won't work on computer!,"My daugter loves this toy but it won't work on the computer. But, she just loves the music. She just downloaded Baby, come back to me and say ok from Vannesa's hudgens music. she loves it!"
4,Daugher really likes it,"The only thing about this is that it does not show the song playing in a window... but other than that it's easy for my 10yr. old daughter to use- she's downloaded songs and changed her playlist without needing any help from me. She really likes the online features, too!"
3,As good as Other cheap MP3 players,I purchased this for my 5 year old and it was very easy to install music on. The online site is a little neat but daughter doesn't really care to play on it much - she just likes the music player. It holds several songs and she loves that she can switch out the accessories on it. It like another Barbie doll or something. The only bad thing is that you have to start at the beginning each time you turn it on. It does skip songs but if you have older songs on it first you have to skip past all of those to get to the newer ones you want to listen to. Overall this is a really good item for the clearance price of $12.99. I gave $20 w/free deco packs and I think that was worth it.
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a bad buy. Even if you charge for over an hour will shut itself off after a couple of minutes, hense no power to your amp. Please do research before you buy a capacitor and speakers through amazon.com/discount jungle.com. Pretty sure I got ripped off."
1,A Short Story Balooned into 597 pages,"There is exactly one plot device in this book.And it gives it away on the book jacket.Then you have to wait for 400 pages to see it.This book is literally just every character saying the same thing to every other character over and over and over and over. Instead of developing what could have been a very interesting idea set in the ""invasion"" story backdrop it is a continuous stream of talking heads. All of whom repeat what they said in the last book.What little character development is so minimal, that you need a microscope to find it. Don't bother with this one. Harry can do much better."
2,Homeward Bound,"Tedious.Skilled writing, but the author makes the same point on every other page for hundreds of pages"
2,2 1/2 stars for talented Deborah Shelton,"This is a soft porn film starring Nick Cassavetes as an ex-con working as an investigator for an ex-cop who owns an insurance agency. Jack Nietzsche (Cassavetes) investigates fraudulent claims. For example he peeps into the window of a hottie in a wheel chair who actually has no problem moving around when no one's looking. She's even able to have sex! No sense explaining a thread bare thin plot involving strippers, hookers, gangsters and con-men. Cassavetes who's now into directing (""Notebook"", ""Alpha Dog"") made the right move. It's definitely worth mentioning his co-star, Deborah Shelton a former Miss USA/Texas who does the full monty several times. Also Miles O'Keeffe (remember Tarzan with Bo Derek?) and Richard Roundtree (original ""Shaft"") have roles. The movie is terrible except the sex scenes which are particularly good for this genre. I was going to toss this film, but realized it's out of print and auctioning for over $30. Like I said, a keeper."
4,"Great, challenging workout","This is a great workout for beginners who want to work their way up to a more advanced level of exercising, and intermediate exercisers like me who don't always want to use weights. The portion of the workout in which you can add weights feels a little silly w/out them, but I'm sure there's still some good toning happening. The only thing I don't like is the ""yoga stretch""/cool down in the longer workout, b/c it doesn't feel like a cool down. I'm sure some enthusiastic yogis feel that holding downward dog and one-legged dog is relaxing, but after a 50-minute workout I'd prefer to sit on the floor (or just stand) and stretch. Tanja is a great, fun instructor."
4,Good intensity- could use longer cardio...,"I like the choreaoghraphy of this video quite a bit. However, the cardio portion is only about 20 mins - which isn't ideal if you're trying to lose weight. Otherwise, great instructor. Moderate intensity."
1,WARNING!!! DO NOT BUY,"As a Digital Photographer and a MAC user, I found iPhoto crashes when you try to IMPORT any DIGITAL (only)l pictures from Adobe Photosop CS & Adobe Elemebts 2. I can downlaod my pictures to iPhoto from my Digital camera (D70), export them to my pictures folder, adjust the pictures using either above mentioned software, but cannot Import any of them. Go to MacRumors, you'll see that you're not alone. Hey APPLE?? When are you going to fix this????"
4,Very nice upgrade,"Excellent upgrade to iPhoto (I really like the full-screen editing), + iWeb is easy to use, though I wish it had a few more templates/customizability. I haven't used iMovie or iDVD much yet, but the transitions, etc. look very nice. iWeb/iPhoto integration for photo-based web pages is great."
4,Not for PMG3,Might be a good product but I'll never know.I purchased before doing my homework.It will not install on Blue and White G3
1,Not worth it if you do not have a .MAC account,I do not have a .mac account because I have my own domain. And all the feature in this DVD is something you can use with a .Mac account. iPhoto is fine OK update.
3,Breaking Point,"This was the first book, by Martina Navratilova and Elizabeth Nickles that I had read and I have to say that it was hard going getting into the book but once past those first 50 pages it was an enjoyable read. Easy read, fast paced mystery with lots of action and for those of us who love tennis quite an insight into some of the behind the scene wranglings that we may never have thought of. I enjoyed it and would say that most tennis fans would."
3,At Wits end,"I have always enjoyed Ema's works , but some how this book did not really appeal to me that much."
5,wits end,Very good book. A quick easy read. Comical. Addresses Parenthood and married life in a hilarious way . I would recommend this book for light hearted nighttime reading.
4,"details, details","I have to disagree with the previous reviewer. I read that review, and I was all set to wade my way through the first couple chapters, forcing myself to read it in order to get to the good parts. However, I didn't find it that difficult to get into. I really enjoyed all the detail and complication of the story, and some set up is helpful here. I was pleased to see that there weren't any dreadfully obvious inconsistencies as one sometimes finds in complicated tales. I had a hard time putting it down in places. The only reason I couldn't give it five stars was that the dialogue could occasionally be improved, but I've heard far worse in Star Trek episodes. Read it, you won't be sorry."
5,An Amazing Product,Not often do I ever see a product which compines function and style so well. Not only was I sure that my CDs were safe. I was proud to carry them around in their stylish case.And best of all this product although it is very high quality is not very expesive.
2,The best of their veggie dinners is still not very good,"I gagged it down and later that night it came back up. Not lot of flavor going either way, you are better off with zatarain's black bens and rice. They are only $3 and taste very very good at home and on the trail. Mix with tuna for a special treat. Add some ""tillamoos"" or tortilas for variation."
5,This is an excellent film that just happens to be animated.,"""Rail of the Star"" is based on the true story of a Japanese family caught behind Communist lines in Korea at the end of WWII, as told by their young daughter. The animation is first-rate and the writing is superb; if made in the US, this TV Tokyo production would have nailed down an Emmy, or had a solid shot at an Oscar.Parents: please note that, although there are no actual combat scenes, this is a movie about war, and very bad things happen to some of the charcters. Young kids may need you to watch it with them, and preschoolers probably shouldn't see it at all.This film is especially recommended for schools and libraries."
5,A must watch,"Relatable, informative and empowering. I hope all expectant parents get a chance to view this film. A great modern way to understand birthing choices as well as a comprehensive explanation of the support thats available."
3,"Not bad, but not her best work","Dark Horse was not a bad book, but it did take me an awful long time to read, which in my terms basically means that the story wasn't intriguing enough for me to not want to put it down. I liked the main character, Elena Estes, but it also seemed like more of the same as in many of her other books...female in a role of law enforcement that did something that has turned all her colleagues against her so she is now an outsider and must try to do her job while dealing with their animosity.. does anyone else feel like this formula is getting kind of old in her books. I'd like to maybe read something a little different for once. Aside from that fact, the story wasn't bad, it just wasn't that intriguing; and the ending was not very satifying to me. I'm still a fan of Tami Hoag, but I really did not find this to be her best work."
1,very upset,"this book was not too great. Story is repeating itself in each chapter over and over again. Very disappointing. I read her others book such lucky lady, ashes to ashes, dust to dust,and guilty sins they were very good."
3,"A definite ""skimmer""","This book never really pulled me in. So, I ended up skimming through it, skipping the meandering paragraphs that didn't help the story line at all.A. The ""feelings"" between the two main characters seemed thrown in just to have some sort of ""relaltionsbip"". There was no chemistry between the two at all!B. The only character who was at all appealing was Molly, and she was 12 yers old!C. Many of the lines made me think I was in a Sam Spade novel. ""She flashed a thousand-watt, toothpaste-ad smile that was nothing more than jaw muscles flexing."" A few lines like this would have been amusing. But, a few hundred is overkill!I will say, this is one of the few Tami Hoag books I wasn't too jazzed about. So, I'm sure I'll buy her next."
3,Dark horse,Very good Kept me interested all the way to the end Will read more of her books in the future
4,Excellent,She's a good author. Made me want to keep turning the page. Can't wait to read the next one in this series.
3,Interesting Setting,Drawn into a kidnapping and murder by a twelve year old girl the heroine finds herself facing her own demons of when she made bad choices as a police detective. Hoag places this mystery thriller in the middle of the elite horse country in south Florida.It was impressive how the author smoothly wove many faceted characters into the story. She took what could have been a rather obvious and predictable story and made it interesting and intriguing through the many sub-plots. A fun read.
3,good deal for price,cubes do NOT measure up to an ounce. 2 cubes equal 1.5 ounces. Plastic is very hard and sturdy. Milk stays sealed. Milk cubes will fall out with a little twisting.
4,Easy way to save some money,"I wanted to feed my son something that I made and knew where it came from. I liked that I could control what went into his food and the quality of the ingredients. During the summer I was able to find fresh fruit and veggies at the local farmers market and make all kinds of great food. Easy to use, easy to remove frozen cubes, easy to adjust his amount. Once the cubes were frozen I would pop out of the tray and place into a freezer bag and label. As he grew I would just give him an extra cube. I also liked the benefit that I could make a ton of food for only a few dollars. After the first few uses it payed for itself.The only reason that I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that it became stained easily. I tried to bleach it but the stain is still there. I know it is clean, but it still looks dirty."
5,Awesome trays,I use these trays to store purée baby food in. They are a little stiff once frozen which makes it difficult to get cubes out but I just leave the tray out for a minute and then twist to release cubes. The lids don't snap on but they gift well enough to keep the food from getting frosty.
2,Good luck getting the cubes out,"It is VERY difficult to get the cubes out of the trays. The trays do not bend well enough to easily pop the cubes out. Yes, of course you can run warm water over the back of the tray to loosen them, but this is NOT an effective way for getting frozen breastmilk out, as it begins to melt slightly, which is not good if you are planning to store the frozen cubes for the future.Also if you're trying to make cubes that are exactly 1 oz in size, this is not the tray for you; pouring in one ounce of breastmilk overflows the little compartment. It might work fine for baby foods to slightly overfill the compartment, but it is messy and extremely annoying with milk.The only positive thing I have to say about these trays is that the lids fit well and are easy to put on and take off."
3,"maybe fine for baby food, but not good for breastmilk","I bought these trays with the expectation that I could use them for breastmilk and just pop an ounce or two out on occasion to add to a smaller bottle that I pumped. It is entirely too hard to just pop one cube out. The whole thing has to thaw out (at least a little bit) for me to get anything out, which kinda defeats the purpose of having it. My son hasn't started on solids yet, but when he does, I will try them again for some homemade baby food...I don't see any reason why they wouldn't work fine for that."
5,ORDERED MORE!,"LOVED these trays. Only ordered a set of 2 at first to test it out. After I made a few batches of baby food, I realized I should have ordered more! Just ordered 2 more sets of two! Love these so much more than other products I have tried! They make perfect 1 oz cubes, freeze for 8 hrs then pop out into a ziploc bag!!! love love love!"
2,cookbook that needs more recipes,I ordered this for my grandma. This book had some helpful information but I was really wanting recipes that she could make that would be simple and fast. Unfortunately there weren't that many recipes nor were there very many recipes in there that I think my grandma would want to make. She's not a gourmet and she has declining health. I was wanting a recipe book with more traditional recipes for her.
4,A Fine Romance,I enjoyed the way Julie's character changed in the movie. It was interesting and fun! Both characteres evolved as the movie played.
2,Extremely frustrating,"Not much in the way of a romance, fine or otherwise. She's cold and stuffy, he's a pathetic buffoon. They fuss and fume over being dumped by their spouses. The only thing they have in common is her spouse is now with his. The rest of the movie is a tepid plot to regain what they've lost (she repeatedly demands that he come up with a means of getting her husband away from his wife and is quite putout when he won't cooperate). Since neither spouse is ever seen, one is left to wonder why the overwhelming desire to get them back. Are they crazy or just desperate? By all accounts, what they `lost' wasn't that great to begin with. This makes them stupid and the ordeal they subject the audience to tedious and tiresome. Not a good movie on any account. I expected better from everyone even remotely affiliated with this doomed project.Definitely not a keeper."
2,"For putting TiVo to disc, it sucks","I hope somebody comes out with a better program for transferring TiVO recordings to DVD. This has got to be the slowest, buggiest program I ever used. Have not used it for anything else. It is SLOW! The fact that TiVo connected themselves with such awful software to make TiVO DVD's is a big mistake. Whoever approved that at TiVo should be fired and they should start again with a different company. Not even a single update in all this time, they must have had lots of complaints. Apparently, they just don't care. Plan on about 2 hours total for each 1/2 hour show. I'm not kidding."
1,Not Like Previous Games,"It's not at all like the fighting games Soul Caliber was. It's like a story based RPG but when you actually FIND the two-player its in the same settings! Split screen, disorienting, not fun.The controls are ok with the WiiMote but the game itself feels rushed, unpolished, gritty. I wish I would have rented it before I bought it."
2,"Cheaply made, functions though","This works but within a day or two, the outer ring around the knob separates from the knob, so you can turn and turn the knob past the start and end points where it stops, and a lot of times you turn the knob only to realize that the loose outer ring is the only thing actually moving. Will probably replace soon, because it's such a pain not having accurate control of the knob."
5,Works great!,Works as advertised - I may need more of these for the house.Used this one in a mobile application to control a sub amp.Very smooth operation - easy hookup.
4,so far good,"so far good - helpful, wish there was more Nanda diagnosis related to options though............................ - I am curious about other books out there. Got if for a good price though"
3,I would have rather seen her with Ricardo...,"I thought this movie was very watchable, and for the most part enjoyable, but I was disappointed in the end. I don't understand what Mary Astor's character saw in Mr. Duneen. He was not a likable guy, a womanizer, and an obvious alcoholic. While Ricardo Cortez's character left much to be desired as well (a married man who only stayed married for the money) he was light years more likable than Mr. Duneen. Even so, worth viewing once."
4,Nice change of pace,"This game is a welcome change of pace to all the other racing games out there. The cars are extremely realistic. They don't handle great ,have poor breaking and slow acceleration. It takes strategy to win these races not just speed and skill as in most racing games. If you like realism this is a great game."
3,"Enahnced features, new apps, so what.","I've been a Mac advocate since I switched from Windows to Mac in 2003 and may even consider myself a Mac biggot howeveer, I'm not that impressed with iLife 06 as I'm not really gaining any noticable functionality, features. The new program iWeb is a concept thats been done successfully by two others, Sandvox and RapidWeaver. In either case, their functionality and features far outweigh that of iWeb and give me no reason what so ever to use iWeb. I am a .Mac subscriber and am even thinking that's becomming a waste of my money as I'm not that impressed with their email system but thats another story.Bottom line, aside from some minor enhancements and tweaks to iPhoto and GarageBand with iMovie HD, I don't see that much benefit from iLife 06 and believe I'll think twice before getting the next release. Particularly if iWeb still only connects to .Mac in the future."
1,Very Unimpressive,"I'm a big fan of the Modern Library series, and of Collinson's work in general, but the only virtue of this book is its brevity. It is certainly not for the general reader who wants an introduction to the Reformation: Collinson leaves too many basic ideas and concepts unexplained, and too many phrases in Latin untranslated. A symptomatic example: He writes, ""We are nearly at the end of the chapter on Calvinism in which we have yet to define Calvinism"" (p. 100). Not a very useful approach! The best parts of the book are its grounding in historiography (how historians' interpretations of the Reformation have changed over time) and its bibliography. Its major weakness, other than those already noted, is that it does not provide a sense of what people actually thought about religion, other than the insightful - but pithy - comment that the Reformation substituted the Ten Commandments for the Seven Deadly Sins (p. 13). It's not worth the time or the price."
4,A Post-Primer on the Reformation and Counter-Reformation,A truly well-written work covering the broad spectrum of the Reformation in the various countries of Europe. Chillson clearly makes distinctions as to the characteristics of the Reformation (and Counter-Reformation) in those countries most affected. One needs to have a reasonably good understanding of the basics of the Reformation to get the most out of this work.
4,A fun murder mystery,"I have been reading mysteries for about two years now, and I have been shocked at how serious most of them are. I realize that murder is a heavy subject, but if I want grim details accompaning medical/criminal facts, I would read the newspaper. Camila T. Crespi offers a refreshing heroine who doesn't take herself too seriously. In fact, Simona Griffo isn't even a professional detective. Rather, she is a working woman who lets her curiosity get her into situations where she doesn't belong. Crespi's characters in Bad Fit are not incredibly complex, but they are interesting. It is fun to be able to unwind the mystery with the heroine which rarely happens in mysteries because the reader isn't often on the same level as the heroine. I reccommend Bad Fit (or any of Crespi's other mysteries) to anyone who wants a quick-paced, interesting, and fun mystery."
2,Not great...,"I purchased this pedometer because I had already been through two Sportlines that were garbage. I had high hopes that this one would be better, but it was not. Although it has some cool features, like the flip-up design, overall it was lacking. The worst thing about it is that the Reset button is very easy to bump into. The radio feature was pretty useless, too. Also, the clip was extremely weak. The pedometer was constantly flying from my waistband. I lost it within a week. Save yourself the frustration and don't buy it."
1,I second that...,FM radio does not work. All other features work (don't know about accuracy). Customer service told me that the battery that powers the radio must be dead. So I went out and purchased a $5 battery only to find out that it was a waste of time and money. Radio still did not work. Buyer beware... Do NOT purchase.
3,for beginners only,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.30 minutes into this workout, I checked my calorie count because I knew I had not broken a sweat or done any heavy breathing and discovered 150 whole calories torched. I fast forwarded through the rest (which was upper body push up work and some ab/glut work) and decided I did not miss much calorie burning time by skipping on to another workout DVD that would actually get my heart rate up.Instructor, music, backup ""dancers"", moves, scenery were fine but I would only recommend this for beginners if you actually want to get the ""cardio"" in the title."
1,"Don't waste your money, lemons abound...","It seems a few are happy, but those of us with the brand new ""lemons"" aren't. After very frustrating tries of it not running when hot I did some web research to find out it was due to a bad coil. This happened right out of the box. I should have returned it. New coil is about $50! Also, as I changed the coil I noticed this wasn't the first time due to bolt scoring and the fact one was stripped from the engine housing. Shame on these guys for pawning it off as new! Also turns out I was missing the side discharge piece. I should never have bought this type of thing online. Foo-ey."
4,Good Instructional Book on Handguns,"Massad Ayoob is one of the best known authors on handguns and their use in defensive situations, but like most gun writers, he eschews great revolvers that are no longer in production, sticking primarily to production pieces. He also has a difficult time saying anything bad about any of the guns, a sure sign of a gun hack. Even so, one can learn a lot from his experience, especially the legal ramifications of using a handgun for defense. One such tidbit is to tell the police briefly what happened, but keep your mouth shut until your attorney arrives. The police aren't always your friends, despite their actions and comments. Meanwhile, anything YOU say can and undoubtedly will be used against you in a court of law. It's an excellent book for beginners and experienced alike."
3,"informative, although too much on competition","This book covers a lot more competitive shooting, (haven't finished the book, so I gave it a 3) so far than self-defense and handgun tactics. However, there is a lot of information about handguns, and I think it will get more interesting as it goes on. Since I've never shot a handgun, I bought this book in hopes of giving me some basics so I can use this to help me train when I do go to the range. Since I don't know much about guns, I'd say this book does a good job of giving me an idea of what's going on and proper ways of shooting. Very informative. Again, I would've given the book a 5 star rating, but I haven't finished it. One bad thing is, the book seems SOOOOO old, kinda disappointed in the paper quality. But I believe if i finished the book, I would've given it a 5."
3,Too Tight,"I know swim caps are supposed to be tight on your head but this one is very tight! It leaves a horrible red mark across my forehead everytime I use it and it gives me a horrible headache. It serves its purpose, but it is a more than a little tight."
3,"Decent, but too tight","The swim cap was very durable and high quality, but it is REALLY tight. I don't have an abnormally large head, but this thing feels very constricting.Hopefully it stretches a bit with more wear."
4,Latex swim cap,"I bought this swim cap for myself, and like the one I bought for my daughter it sticks together when it dries so I have to peel it apart. It doesn't affect the quality of the swim cap, it still works fine."
2,Should spend few more bucks for silicone,"Getting latex instead of silicone is a wrong decision. This swim cap is not flexible enough to put on. Plus, I hate the plastic smell."
5,A fabulous picture of the time,"what a fabulous picture of the time as seen by a young boy. The illustrations, drawn by the author as a child, and the many souvenirs represented are priceless."
5,great movie,the movie was great and in exclent quality.....arrived on time...my husband loved it and was greatfully added to our movie addition
4,Old timer,"Today the story, plot, and special effects is sort of corny--but in the early days when it was releasted, it was a ""grabber"". I remember as a young lad sitting on the edge of my seat watching this thing. Wow, could this really happen some day?? As we all know now, it did, but with considerably different means. It was the forrunner. DVD quality was pretty good."
3,Destination: letdown,"This a great old classic scifi flick. It is another George Pal creation which won awards for special effects. It's strictly 50s with nuclear nerves and the race for space in post war America. Robert Heinlein is credited as a screenwriter and the film is partially based upon his novel ""Rocketship Galileo"". I've seen the film countless times and that's why this dvd appealed to me. Nice case, too bad the quality of the disc was lacking. The colors (especially those wild moonsuits) seemed muted. The sound was muted too. I had to crank the volume on my tv up to levels I'd never seen before just to make the dialog clear. Since it touts itself as an ""anniversary edition"", I would think that it would have been a quality presentation. A great flick presented with faded images and POOR sound...what a letdown."
3,Historically interesing,"If you are a fan of science history as well as a science fiction fan (like me) you will want to see this movie. It was the first sci-fi film to attempt a scientifically accurate account of a flight to the moon.Bearing in mind that it was made 40 years ago using special effects and acting styles of that time, this is a well done movie.If you're looking for something that offers fast action adventure, keep looking, this isn't it. But if you like the more cerebral writings of Robert Heinlein, AC Clarke and Isaac Asimov you'll find this interesting."
4,Not a great film but a noteworthy one,"The Bottom Line:Destination Moon is one of the very few films I can name made prior to the Apollo program that tried to envision realistically how a flight to the moon would come about, and this alone makes it almost worth recommending: nothing about the film is exceptionally well done but neither are there any real problems with it, so if the movie sounds interesting check it out.3/4"
2,Since when did easy get so hard?,"This game broke my heart. I wasn't really a fan of Tiger 05, but Tiger 04 is one of the best games ever made. What happened with 06? There are just too many things to do with the analog sticks that make the game play seeminly impossible. I sold it back and started playing 04 again. You should too."
2,What happened????,Why did EA take a perfect game and screw with it? The '05 game was perfect; easy to play but challenging. There is absolutely no way to shape your shot and add distance with the L1 button unless your an octopus or maybe EA wanted this to be a two player game. One to swing the club and the other to tap L1 for added distance. All I asked was for the '05 gameplay with the same controls but add different courses and a few new players. What we received was a completely different game with difficult menus to navigate and ridiculous controls. If you have played Tiger from 2002 to 2005 you will be dissapointed in the new game. Please take me seriously when I say rent the game before buying it. SAVE YOUR $$$$! I want a refund!
2,Aren't made to play with.,"These Godzilla figures were very cool, but as soon as my son started to pick them up and play they would fall apart. Arms, legs and tails came off easily. Overall he was disappointed and became upset everytime they fell apart."
1,Horrible quality,This necklace lasted all of 3 days before changing colors and the clasp breaking. I am very unhappy. I do not recommend this necklace for anyone at any time.
1,"Junk after 11,000 miles","Replaced both front wheel bearings in '05 Nissan Murano in November of 2011. One or both replacement bearings (TIMKEN HA590046) have failed after a little less than 11,000 miles, and 16 months - warranty is 12 months. I paid over $250 with S&H - could have saved a lot of $$$ and bought cheaper, but thought I was paying for quality. You might as well buy cheaper parts, since the pricey ones fail just after warranty anyway!!!"
2,More fact than fun,"I enjoyed the ""Worst Case Scenario"" book, so I thought this game would be fun. However, it was a complete waste of my money. The basic idea of the game is to progress on the board to the finish by answering questions with a,b,c, options that deal with ""real life"" worst case scenarios. If the players get answers wrong they lose ""limbs"" on their playing pieces. While the questions and answers were interesting, most players ended up spending their time challenging what the card stated as the correct answer. Not only this, but once you've read and answered a question, it's easy to remember, so the next time you play you waste time skipping through questions you already know the answer to. In the end, this game was quite boring."
4,Ash Ra Tempel - 'Friendship' (Manikin Records),"Decent 2000 reunion effort between two of krautrock's most noted players. What's it been now, like nearly thirty years since Ash Ra Tempel main player / guitarist Manuel Gottsching and synthesizer pioneer Klaus Schulze has played on the same record? Good things come to those who wait. 'Friendship' is good, having three lengthy tracks to it.""Reunion"" (30:40) is a nicely done laid-back progressive piece that picks up the pace a bit halfway through. ""Pikant"" (21:40) is probably considered to be world music and the title cut ""Friendship"" (26:30) is a good chance for Gottsching's guitar playing to show off it's sound scape capabilities. A should-have."
3,This game can be sssooo boring sometimes!!!,"This game has a good story line but the exposition in between the battles can be just a little too wordy. Too much exposition to put in a game can make the game a little boring. The cool thing about this game is that when you strike a bad guy or a creature, blood comes out!^-^"
5,"What a great, and versatile lens","I predict this lens will be spending a lot of time on my camera.Only cons is that the motor is a bit noisy... other than that... I love it, it even comes with a lens hood!"
2,long and confusing,"youre this dude who travels all about this underground world and battles weird monsters.when you get into a room with them.the combat mode is very strange.you must pick and choose each minute aspect of every strike you perform.whenever you get nailed with a move you learn it.you can customize your guys fighting style.sounds gresat right?WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!youve got like 10 million stats to keep track of,the game gives you no real indication of whats wrong when it is.theres no clear cut way to go.the instructions are really vague.its all a good idea but,it failed miserably.i wonder if stalin programmed it?"
2,I was disappointed,"I LOVED Mystical Ninja for N64! I rented it 5 times in a row before buying it. When I saw that this game was out, I had to get it, but boy was that a mistake. Sure, the graphics are great, and the storyline is good, but it has sooooooo many more ways to die, less powers and abilities, and is SUPER difficult. I spent 5 hours trying to beat one stage!!! Definately one for someone with lots of patience!!!"
5,Highly recommended for students of furniture design & styles,"This A-Z encyclopedia of contemporary furniture, fashion and graphics designs provides an engrossing survey featuring over a thousand color photos of the works of the finest modern designers. From discussions of individual contributions to wider-ranging surveys of styles, movements and innovations, World Design packs in details about the changing, evolving world and styles of designers."
2,Much More WWE Much Less ECW,This is worse then the 2008 becuase this time there were only 2 good matches.The first one was Y2J vs Rey-Rey for the IC title which stole the show and had the perfect finish. The second one was the ladder match for the World's title which was an epic brawl. The Hog pen match was one of the worst and most dumbest matches I ever seen and I saw every match with Doink The Clown in them. The Submission match between John Cena & Big Show looked like it kept on going & going & going just like the bunny from the battery commercials and it's the same basic match only without the pinfalls. The rest of them were second to third rate. I give this PPV a 3 out of 10.
5,One of the best introductions to copywriting available.,This is one of the best hands-on introductions to copywriting available. It's perfect for beginning students and even as a refresher for old pros. It's chock full of exercises designed to get you thinking about creating good advertising instead of mimicing what already exists. Simply a must for anyone interested in copywriting as a career
4,Fun Pan Set,"I've only made a ""candy corn cake"" (found in the Wilton 2006 Cake Decorating Yearbook, pg. 42) so far, and it turned out pretty good. I made the cake from scratch, and the batter was thinner than a cake mix. The color rings weren't as exact as in the picture, but it still looked pretty good! I can't wait to make more cakes!"
2,Not what I expected.,"let me start by saying that the pans work wonderfully. All three cakes came off with no trouble and not one inch stuck to the pan. I did not use any form of oil or spray. The pans are just that good alone. However, the plastic part that is supposed to help make the cake come out checkered stinks! You would need to have four or more hands to maybe make it come out right and that is if the cake batters don't merge together in the oven. The plastic part does not stay to the bottom of the pan well enough. Therefore, the cake batters end up coming out like marble cake instead of checkered. I was not happy with my finished product because it was not at all what I expected."
2,Bad pans,"I think having a kit to create a checkerboard cake is a great idea, but for a company that specializes in decorating, it seems odd that they included nonstick pans that have sloped sides instead of basic aluminum pans with straight sides. Wilton makes some nice cake pans but these aren't it. I would gladly pay extra for pans that are more appropriate to creating a three layer cake. Because of the pans being nonstick, it was very difficult to make the divider insert stay in place while adding the batter. I would not recommend this product to anyone wanting to make a nice looking cake."
3,What were they thinking?,"I tried to find a checkerboard set like this without the pans but just couldn't. As the other reviewers have mentioned, ""What was Wilton thinking when they put sloped-sided pans in this package?"" The sloped sides do not, in any way, help make this type of cake any easier. It's actually more work because now you either have to trim them or fill in between them.I really liked the way the checkerboard itself turned out though and knew going into it that the pans were just all wrong."
4,fun and easy to use,"Fun, and easy to use.Read directions for bake times on cake mixes to make sure they are the same (as some can be much different.)"
1,What a piece of garbage!,"Are you guys getting paid to write the reviews for this thing?I cant believe i bought it on your recommendation!what a HUGE disappointment, nothing about it reached me. gameplay is sub par. graphics suck big! nuff said"
3,hey jerry pornelle say what?,"hey jerry boy do you have even a shread of intelligence? if you bought the game based on these peoples reviews and didnt like it may i suggest you rent games before you buy them in the future? why dont you tell people why you didnt like the game. its called writing an intelligent review-but i guess you dont know how to do that. clod. as for my opinion ofthis game -in short, it is a good boxing simulation for playstation , at least the best there is out now. yes, it has its flaws but for the true boxing fan the gameplay and fighter selection as well as the realistic announcing make it a worthwhile buy for any true fan of the sport. for clods like jerry-may i suggest ready 2 rumble, a game that appeals to people of less intelligence. nuff said."
2,Who wants to hear a spy whining about killing.,"The main problem with this game is it trys to make a point. Its target audience doesnt want to hear about snakes love life or how meryl always wanted to be a soldier, (boo hoo) We want to Kill, Maim and Destroy. Every boss that has tried to shoot snake, as soon as he shoots them they start whining about their horrible past or their family. WHO ON EARTH CARES. Another bad point is there are no great cinema clips, they all use the in game graphics. I read all these great reveiws saying its just like a movie and I was sorely disapointed. It got 2 stars because if you press your buttons and fastforward the cinema clips, you can at least pretend that snake is a tough-guy."
4,"Good, but i'm spoiled to MGS2.","THis game invented stealth to the gaming industry. Plus, it porved that you could be a badass in a video game. Unfortuantly, no one who has played MGS2 is gonna go play MGS1. And that's a shame, because MGS1 almost beats the 2nd one. Better gameplay? Yes, there's a lot more action, stealth is more important, and there's more gameplay than movie. The story's pretty normal until the end. It seems like a regular terroist movie turned into a game. However, there are some bad things compared to the 2nd one. Bad graphics, can't shoot in First person mode, and you don't have a tranquilizer. Oh well, this is Playstation 1. They improved on MGS2, but only a little."
4,Much Better Than Syphon Filter,"This is a great game. There are endless exciting fights and challenges, and the puzzles are reasonable. A few words of warning: The cimema scenes are endless, sometimes as long as 20 consecutive minutes, and often your desire to keep playing will frustrate. Some of the boss fights (such as the second meetings with Raven and Wolf) seem impossible and can be frustrating. This is also a short game - it took me about 12 hours, and I'm no gaming expert. It may also leave unfulfilled, but that is more due to the excellent gameplay than a subpar ending.Now that its $20, I strongly urge you to buy it if it sounds at all interesting to you."
5,Simply the best,"Metal Gear Solid is the best game i've ever played and is in my opinion the best game of all time. I bought this game after my friends suggested it to me because he raved about it day and night, I can't blame him. The realistic game play and Video just blew me away. I beat this game in a week under easy because i barely ever slept and failed all of my tests that week. Metal Gear Solid is the yard stick to which I measure any other game. Oh and if you love this game as much as I did, you'll probably love Syphon Filter as well."
4,One of my favorite games,"I absolutely fell in love with this game when I first played. The story can get a little confusing at times, but thats no reason not to get this game. This game uses stealth, which really makes it fun for a number of reasons. The graphics in this game are a little cliche, but then again, it came out in 99 and its for PS1, come on. Only problem, it's way too short. If there would have been say, another 4 or 5 hours added to the game, I would have given this game a 5. But due to its lack of lenght, I give it a 4...out of 5"
2,Want to buy MGS?,"I came to Amazon to buy a ""Sim"" game, when I got sucked in by people saying this was the ""best game"", so I bought it instead. Now I wish I hadn't. It's not even as good as ""Resident Evil"".Rent MGS and then buy Command & Conquer! You'll be glad you did!"
4,Metal gear solid,"Game arrived quickly, and works well.Being new to console gaming, I really did not know what I was missing.The game is very challenging and is right on time."
5,Metal gears new game is solid!,"Whoa!I borrowed MGS from my best friend,being a metal gear fanatic.I expected pretty much the usuall.Damn,I was so friggin wrong!Graphics,8 out of 10:The graphics are great,snowy enviroments,the works.The faces in cutscenes could be better with the vampire-like eyes, but its still a great gameStory,10:This story is just...great!.Now leave me alone!Controlling,8:The controlling could be alittle tricky at first,I reccomend trying some VR missions first.Replay Value:Once you get through this game,you'll never wanna stop!"
5,Just What We Needed,"This was a perfect solution for our little guy. He has reflux and needs to sleep at an angle. It also keeps him still at night. He used to wake himself up, and now he sleeps soundly."
2,Be careful with this,"My daughter is almost three weeks and because she is a squimer, she ends up with her head hanging off the back or side. I had to take it out, for me it was more dangerous."
2,BEWARE! Not very safe and isn't made well.,"I bought this when my daughter was a month old and had terrible reflux. Not only did it not help the reflux, but I don't feel it was safe and it didn't hold up in the washing machine. On several occasions, my daughter ended up sliding down in between the side positioners. She was very small, born just over 5lbs, and did not fit to well in this. Because of her reflux, I needed this to stand up to repeated washings. Even with putting absorbant materieal on top of this to try and protect it, she still spit up right through it. When I washed this item, it ended up being deformed. Save your money and find something else. This product is not grea.t The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is my daughter seemed somewhat comfortable in it, that it until she fell in between the positioners."
2,Inclined To Sleep,"This item was truley a great find until the first time my son spit up on it. Then came the challange of cleaning the sleeper. The outer cover and bolsters came through the washing machine and dryer both with no problems but the inner inclined pad was a different story. It folded over on itself and stuck together. Then after the dryer, it became even tougher to return to the outer covering. I would only recommend this item it your newborn does not EVER spit up and require cleaning of bed linens. Right!"
2,Didn't Like it,"We returned it because we really were unhappy with it. Our baby would slip down and it was akward for her to sleep in. We purchased the ""First Years Air Flow"" sleep positioner instead and love it."
4,GREAT- BUT HARD TO PUT COVER ON AFTER WASHING,I REALLY AM HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT EXCEPT HAVING TO PUT THE COVER BACK ON IT AFTER WASHING. IT IS DIFFICULT TO STUFF THE FOAM INTO IT. I AM GOING TO TRY THE OTHER REVIEWER'S SUGGESTION ABOUT PUTTING THE SHEET OVER THE FOAM INSTEAD.
1,Only good for a week and not great then!,"I am not too impressed with this product. It was okay for the first week, but then my son started to slide up or down and would not even be on it by the time he woke up, which defeated the purpose. The sides do not attach very well to begin with and definitely are not helpful if the baby scoots during sleep. Another problem is with washing it. It is very hard to get the cover back on once you take it off. It is like it doesn't fit properly. My son is 5 weeks old and I stopped using this 3 1/2 weeks ago. Don't waste your money!"
3,"It's ""OK""",The down fall of this product is....Make sure you have it all the way at the top of the bed. If you have a sqirmy baby their head could hang over the backend. Also there were several occasions when she wiggled her way to the bottom. I woke up and she had wedged herself all the way to the bottom and her poor little arms were above her head. How uncomfortable. It's ok to use as long as you supervise them. It didn't really help with spit up either. She still spit up a little with the pad. The only part washable is the cover which is a pain to get back on.
1,Does not work,Both of my daughters slid right down the positioner. So I stopped using it right away. I do not recommend this product at all.
2,Definitely Not Safe!!!,"I purchased this sleep positioner for my not even 2 week old daughter figuring she would stay in it throughout the night. Being the neurotic new mother that I am, I woke up to check up on her.. I was horrified when I found her perpendicular to the wedge and the basinet.. It scared me to death and I will not use it again.. I already returned it after one scary night... I just recently purchased the baby's first years positioner. Haven't tried it yet, but I am hoping that this won't happen again!!"
2,not safe,"I bought this product with safety in mind. However, when my daughter was a month old, I was woken one night to her grunting. I found that she had wiggled her way down the positioner and had only her head between the wedges. She was also covered by her blankets which she had wiggled under. I think a flat positioner would be a much safer choice."
1,fell apart,"I was very excited to use the positioner and it really helped keep my little one in place. But, after the very first time in the washing machine, the foam insert began to crumble into pieces. Also, it is very hard to reassemble after washing/drying. Then, the second time through (the wash) caused a big hole in the middle of the positioner. It looked like someone took a huge bite, not to mention all of the foam I had to clean out of my washing machine. I would definitely not buy this item, and am going to look for more sturdy positioners."
2,Air flow positioner is better,"We have this positioner in the porta crib and the Air Flow positioner in the bassinet. The Inclined to Sleep positioner isn't our favorite because our 3 week old slides down in it while sleeping and wakes up crying and uncomfortable. (This doesn't happen in the Air Flow which is 1/2 the price!) The Inclined to Sleep looks comfortable, but not when the little one wakes up crying and uncomfortable!"
3,"It WAS OK, not anymore!","We bought this for our daughter in the hopes that it would get her to sleep in her crib and not with us. It worked, however, she ends up at the bottom of the wedge almost every night! Don't see what good the sides are! We even tried to put them closer together but she still ends up at the bottom! Not to confident about this!"
1,SIDS RISK,"I do not have this exact item, but I did have 2 sleep positioners until I threw them away. I used to think they actually reduced SIDS, but they actually increase the risk. The SIDs Alliance does not recommend these or any form of soft bedding, blankets, or bumper pads. The nurses at the hospital where I had my children would not allow us to use anything like this in the hospital. Our pediatrician says do not use these. My state's child care licencing laws prohibit the use of anything soft in cribs, including bumper pads. I have no idea why these are still made."
3,Too Hot,"My son slept soundly on this mat and I felt I didn't need to worry about him suffocating, because he couldn't roll, but he just got too hot and would wake up sweaty. Don't use it if his room is warm."
3,Great Start but Doesn't Last Long,"We registered for this sleep positioner and received for our little guy who used it for three weeks. At first it really helped him to sleep and feel secure coupled with swaddling. After he spit up on it, I washed the cover in washing maching. I had a horrible time getting it to fit back on the foam as the cover had shrunk. Also, the foam holds smell (i.e. leaky diaper, spit up). The incline helped my son not to spit up as much; however, the pad has ""smooshed"" down and is almost flat after just 3 weeks of use. Now I use my wedge pillow from when I was pregnant to prop up my little guy who has reflux. So far it has worked better, I know the wedge will not smoosh since I used it every night when I was pregnant, and the cover has not shrunk. I so don't throw away your money on this, perhaps by the pregnancy wedge instead."
4,The Beauty of the Live Peformance,"Certain bands are just doing a job, others clearly enjoy the live performance which become a unique recording. From what I hear I would have loved to see and hear this band live. If what is others say is true, this certainly would have been nice to have a DVD version. Perfect sound quality doesn't necessarily make a great live performance. Showmanship involves more than being able to reproduce something note for note. This group though I think has it and their fans appreciate it. Too bad about the aging process."
2,Right is not left and left is not right,"On at least two occasions Patricia calls for the wrong leg to be moved which is incredibly annoying, especially because she is so into the ""flow"" of the movements. If you are not watching the screen (which you will not be doing if you are in downward facing dog), you have to stop the routine and readjust. Also, the right and left sides of the legs are not worked out evenly. I do not love the music and really prefer the Rodney Yee ""15 Minute Results Yoga"" with which the ""Cardio Burn yoga was packaged. It is easier to follow and far more relaxing.For amusement, watch the interview with Patricia and try to keep track of the number of times she mentions her mentor, John Friend. I know people love this guy, but her rapture at every mention of his name veers uncomfortably close to that of a cult member for my taste."
4,Love the express workout,"This video has been my first experience with yoga and I have been pleasantly surprised! I did the express workout five or six times before even attempting the longer one and I was surprised how much slower and almost boring the longer one was. The repetition of the child's pose feels good as a stretch but as far as a cardiovascular workout, it is definitely lacking. However, the express workout is great and the flow from one pose to another is challenging and requires a lot of core strength and practice. I try to do the 30 min. workout 5 times per week and when I am finished I feel great every time! I find Patricia to be very inspiring, positive and calming. She is great at what she does and I hope to someday make flow yoga look as graceful as she does! Great 30 min. workout. Ok 60 min workout. Good starter dvd, nice music, and beautiful California backdrop! I will continue to use it!"
2,Where is the cardio??,"Maybe it's cardio for people who have never worked out.The main work out was very slow, and Patricia's cheesy sayings were really starting to make me gag. I even had to turn the sound off. I will probably NEVER do this one again.Now, there is a bonus express workout that actually was not too bad. Still was not close to a tough yoga workout, but MUCH improved and she kept her silly phrases to a minimum. The bonus stretch was okay. I can do these 2 bonus features infrequently.Due to her EXTREME cheesiness and turtle-moving-rate for the main workout, I will NEVER buy any products with Patricia Moreno."
2,The band seems disinterested,"I realize that Michael Schenker and UFO have gone their separate ways, but Vinnie Moore just isn't cutting it. Moore built his reputation as a ""shredder"" for Mike Varney's Shrapnel Records in 1986. Blame Eddie Van Halen. EVERYONE wanted to play faster than Eddie at the time. Not ""as fast""...FASTER. Moore's style on ""Mind's Eye"" was classified as ""Shred/Neo-Classical Metal""...which is just terrific, but let's all remember that Michael Schenker is basically a thug, and UFO built its reputation on being a melodic thug band. Not ""power pop"" in the style of Journey...they were tougher than that. Moore's sound is too thin. He never really whacks you between the eyes. Maybe this edition of the band can find success in taking new material in a new direction, but as a sampler of old UFO, stick with ""Strangers In The Night"" or the live tracks from ""Covenant."""
4,a must have,my baby preferred to sleep on her side and this provided me with reassurance. also the bumpers around her made her feel snug and secure.
3,it was ok,"Used it for a short time, baby preferred not to have movements restricted. She would wake up because her arms hit the sides."
1,Did not cure,Did not cure. They will be forced to take this product off the market because it is defective. Ruined my $5000 bathroom project.
2,BAIT~MOTORS~TACLE,"Crater Lake, Oregon...3 hours from Vegas has a history of being struck by meteors arousing claymation dinosaurs. Apparently the heat causes an egg to hatch, one that contains a fully grown beast.The film has a few main characters, but then introduces people to be quick episodes. The humor is corny and there is humor by design, but not nearly as much as the MST quality monster. The type of humor we are exposed to is when the two town idiots argue over a sign ""Bait, motors, tacle"" and complain that Bait is spelled Bate. If you enjoy MST style movies, or simply want to punish your kids, this film will do.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."
3,So-So!,"I like James Garner and Jack Lemmon but do not feel this was their best work. They are both ex-presidents whom we find doing various jobs after their bout in the White House. One writes books that no one reads, one does speeches that no one listens to, and of course they hate each other.Thrown together by circumstances making them the bad guys, they run for their lives and are forced to see America through each others eyes and the eyes of the people.I would like to say it is enemies made friends, but I'm not sure that is how this movie ended. I didn't like some of the talk that went on and didn't feel it needed to be as crude as it was, I felt it took away from the movie. However, the two men as usual do a fine job of portraying their characters, I will give them that much! I have seen better but I have seen worse!"
3,my fellow americans,who said being the ex president is no fun !!!! a republican and ademocrat coming together for the good of the country only in the movies avery funny movie.
5,My Fellow Americans,James Garner and Jack Lemmon come across hilarious with thier Republican-Democrat Jokes! good writing and cast.
3,Negative Nancy,"I had high hopes for this book as the reviews were good. The author doesn't give many positive highlights about anything in Panama. I was really disappointed with the authors reviews on food. Out of all the places he reviewed they were all negative. Why would I want to go eat from a place listed in his book? There were some great places to eat in Panama City ( Taj Majal and Marsala). I agree that the cuisine is nothing to write home about in Panama, but he could have found some nice place to eat. Also if you plan on using the public transportation system, this book doesn't give very much. It is mostly written from the perspective of rental cars or your own car."
3,"Sexy looks, plane tunes.","It looks really cool. Display is somewhat cirved up, so it may be a little bit inconvenient to see from below (that is, from your bed). Tuning is difficult, so I keep the same station all the time. TV band is impossible to tune in, at least in my neighborhood. Display is very beautiful. It is so bright that I usually keep it face off in the night. I would give six stars for the looks, but the radio is a bit disappointing. You can find a clock with digital tuning for the price."
4,"Alright, but should have been better","Easy to use word processor with a nice, minimalist interface. But it does have some minor problems.Bad exporting feature aside, iWork's Pages doesn't identify or help correct grammar mistakes in documents. Has an okay ""spell check"" feature, though. These features are important to me because I write lots of papers. For these reasons, I took off one big star."
2,Item returned,"I didn't want to rate this item because I did not use it. I had to contact the seller about returning it, because the hinges were broken off. Petco has a policy where you can return/exchange to a local store, but since the item was broken the seller requested that I just dispose of it properly. I then shopped in the local store and purchased an item that was unbroken and more appropriate for our need in addition. This item in the store looked very sturdy, I am not sure why the one I received was broken in the manner it was. Seller was very fair in customer support and solving the issue of the broken item. I would definitely buy from them again."
4,Not Blue/Gray...Red/Beige,"I already had one container and wanted another one. When I couldn't find it in either of the local petstore's, I resorted to an online purchase. It's exactly what I expected except for one detail...its not blue and gray! Its red and beige. It doesn't match the other container I have, but it doesn't matter if its just going to be sitting in the garage."
4,Great value for the money,"With the purchase of this monitor, I finally joined the LCD monitor club. I think it is time for everyone to join the club and what better way than with this monitor ! Great price. Great quality. Takes only a couple of minutes to set up. After the computer is switched on, it does an auto adjust and that is it.I didn't give it 5 stars only because I didn't want to make it look like this is the best among the best. I have seen better LCD monitors than this. The images are a weeny little distorted - like letters typed using a type writer on a bad sheet of paper. This may not be the choice for someone who works on a computer 8 hrs a day. But this is the perfect choice for a home computer."
5,Body Fantasies Fresh White Musk,People I don't know frequently stop and say they like my perfume and sometimes ask what is it. I just say its musk and don't let on that its a $7 body spray.
2,Left Down Again,I agree with the first review. I was a fan of Y/R in the late 70's and 80's and found the music so beautiful it has haunted me to this day that I cannot find out or obtain that same music. I would love to know if it is available on any other recording.
1,Unpalatable,"Being a magician currently in the military, I bought this book with great excitement. I had expected the author to create a fictional world around basic historic facts, so the point made by other reviews about the book not being true did not effect me one way or the other. However, the book soon lost my interest. The authors writing style is very awkward. It is neither matter of fact non-fiction, nor compelling fiction. He has chosen a writing style somewhere in-between the two, and it did not work for me. A great ""true"" story with great ""real-life"" characters but poorly presented. In a word, unpalatable."
2,Boring and predictable,"Edward James Olmos is a great actor. He is the only reason that I gave this movie even a '2 rating'.This was a very disappointing, far from memorable movie. I will probably pass it on to one of my grandsons who likes baseball.I found this movie to be boring and predictable."
4,Fun,"Burnout Legends was the first PSP game I bought. So, I didnt have too much of an expectation. But now I am happy with the purchase. Road Rage and Eliminator are the ones I like most.There's one thing I didnt like about this game. There is some delay while loading events. The game itself takes a while to load initially."
3,"It's a fun game, but sluggish at times","The gameplay is fine but the graphics could have been better and the frames are'nt all that great. also, clipping problems are present. overall, i like it ok."
1,Horrible service from seller,"This purchase could not have gone more poorly, as I have yet to receive the title at the time of writing this. The seller apparently sent someone else this game...and has asked me to return some mysterious ""other"" game that he assumes he sent me. This is not the case, I have waited for well over a month for this title...all the while requesting some sort of coorespondence witht the seller of which he pretty much refuses to respond to all of mine...Other than to say ""I am waiting for you to return the wrong game that you received""....of which I have none to return. This is getting downtright rediculous at this point and I need to know what the next steps are."
4,"Fascinating topic, fair writing, tragic ending","If you like French haute cuisine, this book will give you a lot of insights into how it's created -- not how it's cooked, but the amazing amount of work by a large group of people to produce and serve it. The writing is serviceable but a bit simplistic.I just heard that Mr. Loiseau was found dead yesterday, probably a suicide in the face of a downgrade in his Gault-Millau rating and a possible downgrade by Michelin. What a tragedy."
1,What the heck happend?,"Firstly, I just have to say I loved Turok and Turok 2. Turok 3 however was a big disappointment. The graphics and sound were pretty good overall I guess, but the playability was non-existent. The best part of the game was inside of the first 10 minutes. I dont know what happend here, but I was majorly mad at wasting my hard earned cash. Buy this game if you need an expensive coaster."
1,Turok 3,I purchased Turok 3 in hopes of being equally stunned by the graphics that I saw in Turok 2. I'm sorry to say I was let down-big time. Turok 3 does not even come close to the fantastic graphics that you seen in #2. It seems slower and has jerky movements. I would encourage people not to purchase it. The creators or turok 3 should be ashamed of the quality of this game.
2,this hurts,"its like shooting myself in the foot to say this game sucks, but the truth is it does. turok 2 was a masterpiece. But instead of trying to top it, which makes most companies succesful with a video game franchise like turok, it looks like acclaim thought using the same trick twice would do it, unfortunatley thats not the case. the boss fights were awful and didnt make any sense. The weapons were the same as turok 2 with a few upgrades, most of wich are useless and uncreative. The graphics were excellent for this games time though. Theres more but i cant name them all. If your a casual first person shooter then avoid this game, but if your a turok fan then this game should be in your collection."
2,New Turok game lacks punch of series,"The Turok series is a classic for n-64, but the series has become stagent. Turok 3 lacks the weapons and levels that the other two turoks had. What happended to dinosaurs? You'll see muntant bloodsucking leaches than you will dinosaurs. The producers of this game promised better multiplayer than rage wars. Boy were they wrong. This game also has little replay abilty.I recommend that you should rent it instead of buying it."
1,Don't waste the time or money,I made my order in Feb and it is the middle of June already and I have nothing to show for it. DONT BUY. I have contacted and called. Even the e-mail that they update me with today has absolutley no genuine apology. It just says they will be resending a copy of May. WHY WOULD I WANT MAY's ISSUE now??...Dont waste time or money.
1,Horrible watered down hisory,I sat down to watch this documentary with my family. And 10 minutes into it I changed my mind realizing it was much of the same garbage found in watered down history books.
4,I love the details and wealth of information.,"It's a first rate documentary. I'm viewing it slowly...There's a lot of factual information to digest. It's just what I wanted - solid, historical content."
4,Just OK,"I was given this mower as a gift because it is small and light weight. My children meant well, but I do not think this mower was designed for my lawn which is over 1,000 square feet and has a slight up hill portion. I believe this mower has guts and does get the job done, but it is small and for a smaller lawn. The mower does leave the grass cut nicely, I use the highest height adjustment. I have a complaint about the wheels constantly coming off while I am using the mower. The handle is not really strong enough for up hill mowing and I am only going up a slight incline. I cut my lawn once a week. If the grass were to really get high this mower would have a tough time. I wish the mower was made 18"" wide and it would serve me much better. The quality could also be improved the grass catcher is a good idea, but holds little and is made cheaply. If I were to replace it I would get a bigger more sturdily build mower. I do like electric though, had been using a gas mower."
3,great for small lawns but with some negatives,"it is practical, small, easy to assemsble, easy to carry around, easy to use...some negatives: the handle cannot be folded so it takers more space to store. The adjustment for level of grass is very very difficult. Instead of a easy button, you need to disassemble the wheels to get to the part where the level of blade can be adjusted. It comes with a level that cuts your grass from the root and leaves just soil! So, you have to go through the difficult process to adjust it to the highest level (which is 3"" of grass anyway). It should have been much easier (such as a nob or a botton outside) to adjust the level of the blade easily."
1,"Too Small, Too Fragile","I purchased this mower for a very small yard which is not level. The mower would not roll easily over rough places in the yard, would not cut high grass without bogging down & shutting off. At one point when traveling over a rut in the yard, one of the back wheels flew off even though they had been tightened when the mower was put together. The mower might work well for trimming where grass is short & ground is very flat but is too light weight for anything more."
3,leave the wheels off,"The mower is the right size for my lawn.Assembly went well except for adjusting the wheels.Don't know who suggested to put the wheels on the mowerat the plant but they made a very large mistake.Leave them off,that way people can easily adjust them to their likingThank You"
3,acceptible yard equipment,"The ryobi 13"" cutter is acceptible for a small yard. The shipping was slow in arriving. The mower had been partially assembled prior to shipping. The wheels had been installed and screwed in so tight thatI WAS unable to unscrew them and had to take it to a service facility to correct the factory assembly. Im fairly handy and do my own mechanics - this was not possible. equipment is good, --- not great."
5,Electric mower,"This mower is fine for the yard I have. I have only used it a couple of times but I'm hopining it will last longer than the last electric mower I had which died after 5 years. The model I purchased must have been discontinued because when I went on line to register it, it wasn't even listed among the products on their website."
1,The Zire 21 resets when placed near your cell phone !,"This is outrageous - my Zire 21 was frequently doing spontaneous hard resets, losing all the data. I finally figured out why - it can't be kept near a cell phone. Huh ???? What do they think we're all carrying around with us all the time ? Someone should file a class action lawsuit and make them do a recall on all these units ... Meanwhile, don't buy one unless you want to be constantly backing up your data, since Palm is apparently doing nothing about this."
2,not a great item,"While the Zire 21 is economical if you're looking for just the basics, the annoyances of it far outweight the money you save. The lack of a back light is a bit annoying. More of a hassel are the technical glitches and problems that I frequently have. Mine has a habit of constantly resetting itself and erasing all the information stored in it and going back to blank factory settings. A hotsync restores the info, but it's a pain if you are out during the day and need your date book or address book then."
1,Bad Palm Pilot,"Like the others, I bought this Palm since my old Palm V died. Lured by the low price and name 'Palm', I figured this would be ok just for the basics. After a few months (just after the meager 90 day warranty expired) my Palm died. Kaput. Nothing. After doing some 'soft' and 'hard' resets, still nothing. I will not buy anything from Palm again. Waste of money and time..."
1,Poor customer service,"I recently replaced my Palm 105 with the new Palm Zire 21. While the features are more than adequate for organizational, non-web needs, my particular unit has not worked correctly since I bought it a couple of months ago. It wipes out all the data from time to time, making it useless. Palm's service has been deplorable. Even though the unit is clearly defective, and is still under manufacturer's warranty, Palm will not replace it free of charge - and has offered only to repair for a $39 handling fee (this for a unit that cost $99 to purchase!). What a foolish business decision on their part - they have lost my confidence and all future business."
2,This game [is not good] !!,"I purchased this game and initially was amazed with the simple storyline and simple yet nice graphics. But later as the game progressed, I started getting distraught. Some of the levels of this game are almost impossible to complete. Added to it the slow movement of the character Dirk despite in the run mode, the inability of the game to really capture quick keyboard movements at some times, inability to set hotkeys for the essences (one has to keep scrolling through the list to pick any specific essence)...and you have a very very frustrating game. I thought the notorious 'Obstacle course' of Indiana Jones- Emperor's tomb was most difficult (took me atleast 125 tries) but the 'Pits and Falls' level of Dragon's lair has taken the cake. 140 times and still counting. Grrrr...Game designers->Make levels difficult but not at the complete advantage of the game engine. Gamers->Buy this game, play it, come to some of the difficult levels and throw it away."
2,Nothing Groundbreaking Here,"As is typical of this series, The Third Thousand Years is nothing more than a retelling of the old testament in Skousen's own words, with a series of student-style review questions at the end of each chapter.Boring. Nothing mind-stretching. Told very simply, as if he's teaching 10-year-olds. He doesn't even really teach anything as far as deeper meanings or enlighten the reader on the larger-world context in which these stories were lived and told.I prefer to read the Bible for myself and glean my own meanings from its stories rather than read someone else's. Much more interesting."
2,Not very good Quality,"When I got these, one of the cartridges had loose ink all over inside the package. The ink also does not print consistently. Sometimes it prints great. Other times it looks like my ink is already running out. Not happy with this purchase!"
4,Good game not so good playability,"Good game with lots of neat objects and items. The iteractions are cool too. Everything you need to throw a great party. But you get bored of it after a while, and don't get it and plan on not spending more money on another expantion pack. The Sims Makin Magic, Bustin out, and Hot date give you a lot more to do so you are never in a position where all your mood bars are full and you dont have something to do."
5,GREAT but......,"This is an awsome game (well at least the regular one is) I love being in so much control. This is a great game for power hungry people =) BUT... if you don't have a computer that can download things or a computer that can handle all the EP's (expansion packs) than it's not worth it. I don' t think it's very fun if you can't explore new places or do new things like in the EP's. If you do get it you'll get tired of it VERY quickly, BUT... if you go to www.c-and-c-enterprises.com you can get some awsome downloads that will help spice up the game. Here is what I think of the EP's I haveSuperstar * * * *It's HARD to become a superstar!!Makin Magic * * * * *I love earning crystals!Unleashed * * * *I Love the pets but it was a little dissapointing cuz u can't do much w/ themThanks for reading! I hope this helped!"
2,Incorrect Remote,I returned the player because the remote did not work with the unit. A second player was sent and it had the same problem. The remote that came with these players is generic with no brand name or logo and is incompatible with the unit.
1,DON'T BUY,"Wish this review would allow a 0 or 1/2 star rating! Don't waste your money. Spend a few extra dollars and buy one that will work for more than half a year. Bought this (name brand, should be good and what a value!) - sucker! DVD stopped working within 4 months. Memorex offered to repair - for $75 plus the cost of shipping to them. Why would I want to pay more than it's worth to have this piece of junk fixed? Spend the extra money you'd be spending anyway!"
2,Anatomy & physiology,I forgot to mention that the book did come in a brown paper wrap that was torn off the book and the mail man saw part of my address and brought to me. rhonda
4,Doing Business in China,This is a very good book to give you a general overview of business practices in China. I had to buy it since it was required for one of my MBA classes and I did enjoy reading it.
1,Beware the Hype and Rigged Reviews,Oh come on - please give us more credit. So many 5 star reviews to go with that must-click ad on the WSJ homepage. Does anyone seriously believe most of them weren't written by the author himself?
3,"Looks like an excellent game, but.............","Even thought all I have is the demo, it looks pretty cool, up until the battles. It's a painful reminder of Final Fantasy for Playstation. That's probably the only drwaback. But if the rest of the game continues that way, I wouldn't buy it. I'd probably wait for that Animorphs game for Playstation come out and buy it after the price drops. Well, that's my recommendation."
3,Like Other Reviewers Have Said...,"... this is a solid Cannibal Corpse album, but offers nothing new or particularly invigorating. Everything sounds great: production, musicianship, vocals. All the tracks are entertaining. ""Pounded into Dust"", ""Dead Human Collection"", ""Unleashing the Bloodthirsty"" and ""Blowtorch Slaughter"" being the best tracks. Unfortunately there are no tracks of the magnitude of say ""Hammer Smashed Face"", ""Staring Through the Eyes of the Dead"" or ""Devoured by Vermin"". As such this is an entertaining but non essential record by the band. Newcomers should start off with ""Tomb of the Mutilated"", ""The Bleeding"" and ""Vile"". ""Live Cannibalism"" is also a good place to start."
1,I know how this band was born....,"I imagine it was something like this... THey realized they were a bunch of bad and talentless musicians. So, they decided to gain some public attention by drawing gore covers and disgusting lyrics. As it's always the case, they succeeded in finding some nerds that will like their ""Music""..."
1,cannibal corpse? What a joke!,"Cannibal Corpse the stupidest band in the world, Death Metal? No no no, this isn't death metal, this music is flat out .... Oh oh, let's kill a woman and describe it, how interesting. This album, along with all the other Cannibal Corpse albums ....! If you want real death metal, with real lyrics, get In Flames or Morbid Angel... quit supporting this worthless band!"
3,Ehh..,"Now I'm not like one of those imbeciles ranting ""they're so disgusting""; I can't stand those brainless reviews. The lyrics don't constitute the entire album, and the next time you think of Cannibal Corpse as untalented, find one of their songs and then play it on guitar, bass, and drums, since you know so much about musicianship. That doesn't suggest that this album was great though; after the departure of Chris Barnes this once groundbreaking death metal outfit has fallen into the repetitive slump of grindcore. For some reason, the artwork has changed accordingly with the music style and the vocalist, and that has lost its edge as well. This, Vile, and Gore Obsessed are good to listen to if you want some heavy technical metal, but it's not fitting for the name. With Chris Barnes, they put out album after album, each one great, and each one a little bit better than its predecessor. Then starting with Vile, they became a different band that goes nowhere. Just my thoughts."
3,Meh...,"This particular Cannibal Corpse album sounded uninspired and formulaic to me, plus there was not enough variation in the song structures. If i remember right it was just WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!(end song),(next song)WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW! and so on, and so on, until they had enough songs for an album. This one got SOLD! I much prefer Gallery of Suicide (their best imo) and Gore Obsessed."
1,BAD,"I dont beleive u people like... ALL CC CD'S SOUND THE SAME. In fact now that I think about it all death metal sounds the same. Answer this for me, can u put a CC cd in your cd player and press random and when a song comes on can u name it without looking?..."
5,Pounded into Dust and back..,"This is really the first cd by them that I have had the honor of listening to. It is so intense and great guitarwork.No one has anything on them. (...)As far as the pop issue goes, in one ear and out the other..."
4,An excellent book to introduce a novice to the principles of nitrous oxide,"I first read this book in about 1993. Back then it was still reasonably new, so most of the principles discussed were cutting edge, and inline with the beliefs and logic of nitrous racers of the day. Now it's a bit dated, and lots of new concepts in the application of nitrous to modern racing engines have emerged. However, the book still delivers an excellent history of how nitrous came into common use and also the fundamentals of how it works. I'd recommend this book to any novice nitrous user to improve his or her understanding of what it can and cannot do."
1,needs a battery,"Returning this, disappointed to find that it needs a 9v battery or an AC adapter, not included. The battery is drained as long as there is a plug in one of the two input jacks. Silly rabbit, why couldn't it cycle off when no signal flowing for 5-10 minutes (or some similar solution)? I'd be replacing the battery constantly or having to unplug it all the time. (Rest of my setup is all on a single power strip that I can switch on/off easily.) The old Boss FV-200 on loan to me from a friend doesn't require any power source."
4,little big man,Good straight rock n roll. This is good ole bar music. i especially liked track 5. Sure looks good to me. Radio airstream friendly for the 40 something adult. I hate to make comparisons but if you like Bob Segar you will like this!---Anthony hanley
5,GOOD BOOK,This is the book that most of the information in the anarchist cookbook came from.Only this book has a few more explosives and some guns to make right at home.Pretty good book.
5,The end all and be all of improvised weaponry!,"The series this book belongs to is both comprehensive and accurate.If you've ever taken a college level chemistry course, you already know that the information contained in 'do it yourself' books on this subject is often impractical and sometimes extremely dangerous to apply.While I strongly discourage using this information, you may find it helpful to know that the techniques and devices contained in the manual were invented/tested by Frankford Arsenal in the late 60's.Whatever your specific interests in improvised munitions is, you'll find it in this series of books. (Especially valuable are the sections on swiches & detonators.)Don't waste your time on the Anarchist Cookbook and similar works of theoretical crackpottery. If you want information about the subject that is tried & true, go with the black book."
3,Jane Austen,"I have not opened the original packaging. I did not buy it as a toy, but as a collectible. I understand it is no longer being made, so am glad to get it."
5,flavorful,If you like a flavorful tea this is for you. It seeps up dark and has much flavor not like some others that always seem watered down.
4,I like it but still don't understand purpose of Pentagram,"This band isn't really so Satanic or Pagan as sternly Anti-Christian. Not that I don't like it. It's fast enough and interesting enough. Some grinding, some high pitched whining. Strong on the Bass end. Typical. Faster and more Hectic than Aeon-Path of Fire, and thus better."
5,Complete and essential,"I think is impossible start any project, test any code, think anything about searching and indexing with Lucene or Lucene.Net if you didn't read Lucene In Action, Second Edition before do it.The structure of the book is comprensive and has an increasing curve of knowledge. From history and conceptual, to samples, to API and to the core.Very useful for newbie or professional.I think the best technical book passed by my hands"
3,It is very helpful,It is very helpful and I learned a lot to complete my work project. I recommend it for any Solr beginners.
4,"Come on guys, I've seen a lot worse....","The game isn't all that bad. I've played alot of games in my time and found some awlful games. Waisted money, time and energy. Darkened skye is a little hard, well, pretty hard, and without the walkthru, I most likely wouldn't have gotton thru it either. Although, it kept me entertained, it's a good leangth, and cute to say the least. Although, after I got the first two birds in Zen'jai hills, for some reason I couldn't cross the bridge for a long time, I can't figure that one out.But, I enjoyed it for the most part, and would buy part 2 if it came out.Charmed...Christine"
3,"Relax, it isn't that awful...","The game is not perfect, and thats been established, but what it does do, that some players may find interesting, is make a mockery of the adventure game. It uses its dialouge and run of the mill story line to lampoon the average adventure game. The graphics aren't terrific and the controls make game play difficult, but the character's voices are terrific (I believe that Linda Larkin, the woman who voices the lead character, also did the voice for Jasmine in Disney's Aladdin.The truth is, that when I first started the game I wasn't expecting much and was mainly playing the game because I figured that I had to at least check it out before I rolled my eyes and passed it over. If you're looking for a game that you don't have to take too seriously, then this is a good pick. Just remember, save. Save often, you will die, and it does get frustrating."
5,My favorite version! Anthony Andrews rocks as TSP.,"No one plays the dashing English lord with such charm, humor and panache as Anthony Andrews! Just as Jane Seymour played the best Marguerite St. Just. All the actors' portrayal in this version of Scarlet Pimpernel has become my gold standard with which to compare others. I just wish they had serialized this TV movie like one of the newer adaptations then the fun would have lasted so much longer. Still, I'd rather have this shorter bijoux than any other."
5,Is he in heaven? Or is he in hell?...,"The first time I saw this wonderful movie I was on pins and needles till the Day Dream sailed out of the last frame. The best word I can think of to describe the whole film is charming. Lord Percy Blakeny stole my heart, (along with Margurites) and the show! His ability to transform his features before your very eyes is astounding as well as enthrawling. I would definately put this movie in my top five, possibly my top three. Get it! Watch it! Again and again and again! You'll never regret it!"
5,Wonderful!!,"I love period movies anyway and I've watched this one at least 5 times. The actor who plays the part of the Scarlet Pimpernel seems a bit insipid initially, but as the movie progresses, he portrays just the right mix of tenderness and strength and of course, sense of humor to make the part believable. Jane Seymour is wonderful as usual."
5,The Scarlet Pimpernel,One of my favourite movies ever. Anthony Andrews is amazing in it and so is Jane Seymour. So very good
5,DVD is Coming,"Good news. The Anthony Andrews version WILL be released on DVD later this year. I don't have a release date yet, but I am sure the company that is organising the US release, Image Entertainment, will give it plenty of promotion nearer the time.RegardsAndrew LuffLondon Films"
5,"Wonderful story, Keeps you spellbound, a must see","I loved "" The Scarlet Pimpernel "" as it is a wholesome movie with Romance, humor, intrigue, suspense, honor and people having compassion for others like those in the League. I thought all of the acters and actresses were wonderful especially the romantic couple Anthiony Andrews as Percy, so handsome and versitile in his acting and Jane Seymour as Marguerite, so beautiful and talented. I have almost worn my tape out watching it so much. It's a movie your family will love."
5,I loved it!,"This movie was great! I love period peices and I absolutly love Jane Seymour. It's amazing how beautiful she was when this movie was filmed, and she's much more beautiful now."
1,Too silly.,"I don't understand why this movie has recieved such rave reviews. I watched it and could only handle it for 30 minutes before feeling compelled to turn it off. It was way too silly and ""over the top"" for me. It is a great story, but this version was unbearable."
5,It's disturbing how much I like this movie.,"So what if some of the holes in the plot are so big you can drive through them with a bus? So what if the script is cheesy? This is an eminently watchable movie, and I've watched it, sad to say, about five times... in the last two days. Anthony Andrews is even better here than in Bridehead Revisited. Jane Seymour does a fine job also, and Ian McKellen oozes malice as Chauvelin."
4,great acting but ending slightly different from book,"I've seen the original movie with Leslie Howard and Merle Oberon and they also did justice to their roles as Percy and Marguerite; if you love old-time flicks, go for it! This more updated version with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour is just as entertaining. In both versions, the acting is superb and the scenes and sets are perfect. The only disappointment is that neither of the movies endings quite follow the book and usually as you read the book, you already have in mind how the story is to unfold. Nonetheless, for the hopeless romantics out there (gentlemen take note--this isn't just a chick-flick), pop a version into your VCR, cuddle up with your sweetie and enjoy the fun!!! It is classic romance at its finest with all the pomp and circumstance of merry old England!!"
1,Not the book to use for Bible understanding,This book is written with the Jehovah's Witness doctrine in mind. What this means is that it approaches the Bible to try and make the Bible support their views as opposed to reading to Bible to find God's will. It is good for learning the false doctrine of the JW though. If you want to know what God has to say just pick up the Bible and start reading/studying.
1,Buy the American Release,I bought the international release from Amazon marketplace and received what appears to be a bootleg. Optical and audio quality are horrible. Looks and sounds like it was dubbed from VHS or filmed in a theater.
4,'My life in Pink' doesn't stink!,Yep! I love this movie. I love the fact that this little guy is so convinced by his gender mix-up that he doesn't care or even notice that the adult world around him is in uproar. I was rooting for the parents' liberalism and love for their 'son' to finally conquer their fears and embarrassment caused by the close-minded stares of those around them. This movie is a testament to those who have the courage and confidence to be themselves.
3,The Warlock is back,"Just got done watching Warlock 3. I can't say that it was a work of art by any means, but it was decent. It had an awesome soundtrack to it! Bruce Payne's performance as the Warlock was pretty good...it is kind of hard to decide who was the best between him and Julian Sands. I'd say its about equal. Ashley Laurence does well too...she's a pretty lady. Over all I would give this movie about three stars...it wasn't great, but it was good. I reccomend it if your a fan of the warlock series."
3,eh...it's okay,"this isn't all that you might think it is, definitly a surprising twist from the other 2 warlock movies which is good but it needs work a whole lot of it , looking for a B movie then this is for you however if your looking for a good witch movie you might want to check else where"
3,Boe-bot programming,"It a great robot overall to build. Fun to wach my grand kids build,but tryd to download the soft wear .contacted parallax but they have not updated there it since 2010 . I am disappointed"
3,boebot review,this was fun to build and very challenging to write new programs for. i painted the aluminum body metallic red which looks great.
2,"Great Idea, Not So Great Performance",Very disappointing as we are always looking for non-chemical ways to control pests in our house and garden. The wasp catcher looks great. We hung it within 3 feet of a known wasp nest. And caught nothing but ants.
3,good,"I am not a Jerry Lewis fan, I bought this for the Andy Hardy part, and as ususal the Andy Hardy is too funny. Nice for a dreary Sunday movie watching."
3,Eh,"I bought the first video and was a happy camper, I recieved this one and it seemed to cover less important information and was 4 hours less than the first one. Also in the first one he toke his time and walked you through step by step, in this one he runs through problems like a frieght train and at times I had to rewind a few times, not up to his teaching standards as he was on fractions to algebra. Im disappointed.but the quality is a little better but sound cuts out and is pitchy occassionally.nothing to drastic."
5,Excellent resource for those struggling w/ Algebra 2!,"I bought this for my son who was struggling with Algebra 2. It has helped him tremendously. It is not a substitute for doing homework or for class participation, but it has helped him to better understand concepts he wasn't quite grasping on his own while studying whatever his teacher assigned, and using class notes. It's a good supplement."
3,Good game but missing the small stuff,"The game keeps getting better with each year, but EA misses the small stuff with this one, putting.Every time after you make your putt, the screen will do some awkward/clunky/not smooth transition to an aerial view of the hole.It is choppy and poorly seamed together, and makes you think something is broken every time you see it.Aside from that great game! solid mechanics, calendar tour is slick and as you earn skills, etc, you get sponsors.Online play is pretty tight...aside from the nagging putting stuff, solid fun!"
2,HORRIBLE!!! Stick with 2005,"OK, I don't know who's paying the two guys below, but this game rots! It looks just like 2005, loads more slowly (believe it or not), the menus are really cumbersome, AND you have much less ball control. This is a game, not a golf simulator for pros to play when it's snowing out. This is not supposed to be like a flight simulator for pilots who need to log their hours. Its a game. It should be fun. It isn't. Add to all of these disappointments the fact that you can't earn money/skill points for your own profile when playing other golfers (a near necessity, as they start you out with so little skill a 12 yo kid could toast you). AND you earn them incredibly slowly. I'll still play it, but when I'm having the guys over for some Tiger, it's still gonna be 2005, we've all agreed. Save your money, they'll fix it next year and we can all buy a good game then."
5,Excellent writing and wit,"G.K. Chesterton displays his level of wit and insights into Palestine. His candid views are presented here in a style that is fresh and interesting to modern readers. I highly recommend ""The New Jerusalem""."
4,Catchy Boogie Woogie,"An easy listening CD, with ""catchy"" tunes from the first track. If you dance to music as part of an exercise routine, this is an excellent warm up CD!"
1,Que Lastima !,"Que Asco este material, tengo todo lo de shakira su primer album Magia,Peligro, Pies Descalzos, Donde Estan los Ladrones, Mtv Desconectado, Servicio de Lavanderia, Remixes En Portugues, y Definitivamente esto no Merece Ser Mencionado, no tiene esa calidad que ella siempre nos da, bueno no me importa pero le doy lo que se merece, espero que a la proxima que vaya hacer un disco de presentaciones en VIVO con Dvd aga algo que merezca ser de ella."
2,Don't know...,"I thought this sounded WAY better than her other live CD, Unplugged, and the DVD was good. The only annoying thing is that the CD includes only 10 songs from the show. I think there could have been at least 12 or 14. Also, all of the songs on the DVD are from either ¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones? or Laundry Service, and then there's Back In Black, which was OK. The only song from Pies Descalzos was Estoy Aquí, and I hate how the live version of that song sounds. It's nothing like the one on the album. As for the DVD, it's mostly good. However, the part with Antonio surprising Shakira (by having the Mexicans sing a song for her) on Valentine's Day doesn't seem real; it looks as if it's acted out. For example, when Antonio wakes up Shakira, she's already wearing all of her make-up and her hair's brushed."
1,Come Back ! Shaki,"Porfa Vuelve hacer la misma de antes, no como ahora que eres una rubia descelebrada y tonta. Este Dvd No vale la Pena comprarlo asi sea de una artista tan completa como tu, pero bueno solo les digo a todos que compren In This Skin De Jessica Que Sus canciones Estan Rebuenas En Especial In This Skin, Take My Breath Away , Whith You And Angels."
1,I'm Sorry,"The Dvd Recording Is No Way Live Its Straight From Laundry Service, and i can't get the cd to play on my computer so i may never hear Shakira live until they come to my city or i break down and buy a stereo, i wanted to like this so much but I can't say i'm a happy camper right Now."
2,really mediocre,"My husband and I bought this ""all-in-one"" printer a couple years ago for $129... After a few months the scanner stopped working, since we were still under warranty, we managed to have it replaced, however, I have to say that it is a really mediocre printer, the paper jams a lot, the printing is never even, the ink cartridges are very small, etc. Right now I am buying another printer and will keep this one as a scanner only, for as long as it will work (cross my fingers). Look for another printer while you are still on time."
2,You get what you pay for.,"I've owned this printer for a year, and for awhile it was okay. It does a horrible job of printing pictures, but scanning and copying work good. Paper feeds crooked every time, and I'm not unfamiliar with printers. I tried everything to fix the silly thing. Now it won't feed paper at all. Unless you print daily, be prepared to ""clean"" the cartridges before you print.I'm moving to Epson - I like the idea of a color cartridge for each color and it comes highly recommended by friends."
1,.Mac is something of a joke,"Why would anyone want to pay for web services such as these when the same stuff can be found free at various sites? Gmail offers its free email services with 1GB space. Various photo sites allow you to post, distribute, and print your pics. Sure .mac allows you to work ""seamlessly"" with iphoto but is this really worth the yearly membership price? Evidently, many reviewers don't think so and I would heartily agree. I wish apple would put its energy into something more worthy. I love mac products and think their computers, laptops, ipod are top rate--so why waste their time on a service that resembles AOL?"
4,Good Camera,"Easy to use, battery stays charged for a long time, nice LCD display, great zoom, and the convience of using your computer floppy drive. It is a little expensive for 640*480 resolution, and the picture quality could be a little better."
4,Exactly the right product,"I ordered this camera for my Dad. He needed an easy-to-use camera for his real estate business. The easiest I could imagine was pictures on floppy disks to e.mail to clients, no USB transfer.I worked with the camera for a week and it was great. I had to give it up to him reluctantly, so I'm ordering another to use in my web site business."
3,"Good camera, but the resolution...","The Mavica FD73 is a good camera if you're just getting started out. But the low 0.3 megapixel resolution is a problem. Even on the ""fine"" setting, it's still not enough detail to really satisfy. Love the removable-media method of storing pictures - allows extended sessions by giving you an unlimited and easily-replenishable supply of media (you can make a quick dash to a local Wal-Mart in a pinch).All in all, great camera for casual photo-shooting, or if you're shooting photos for a personal Web site or small-business Web site. But if you're really into photography, and need the resolution, get one of the CD Mavicas."
4,getting alot of use from this camera,"I read alot of the reviews for this camera before I purchased it. Mostly I was concerned about the pic quality, but decided to get it anyway. It has two main modes: standard and email. Both modes produce fairly good quality pics, perhaps not suitable for editing, but great for standard utility shots to send to friends or use in online auctions. It takes the best pics when the object is well lit; pics are sometimes grainy when taken indoors with low light. Overall, I'd say that this camera offers what most people need in a digital camera and I am glad that I didn't spend more. The pics are high quality, the camera is easy to use, has very high battery life and lots of functionality. Tip: buy a camera case right away."
1,WARNING!,"This camera is a dud. I bought one to take on vacation. The photos look okay on the camera, but when you get home and look at them on your PC they are almost all out of focus. The auto fucus worked properly less than 10% of the time. There is NO manual focus on this camera. My vacation shots are ruined."
3,good but not great camera,"The Sony Mavica was my first color digital camera. Although I took a lot of pictures with it, I eventually bought another digital camera. The biggest problems with the Mavica are.1. The resolution - 640 by 480 just isn't good enough. If you do any photo editing at all, the quality suffers because of the low resolution. You need at least a 1200 by 800-1000 resolution, preferably more.2. The LCD is too hard to use, especially in strong light. You really need a viewfinder.3. The floppys just don't store enough. If you go on vacation, you need to carry a bunch of extra floppies in your pocket.On the plus side, the battery life and 10x zoom are great. But that just doesn't make up for the weaknesses mentioned above. Do your self a favor and get camera with better resolution - and maybe you'll only have to buy one.P.S. I traded up to a Kodak DC260 and like it fine."
2,Book is very outdated,"This book was probably a good resource when it came out in 1990, but condsidering it hasn't been updated since, you'd be wasting your money. Electric RCs have come a long ways since this book came out 19 years ago!"
1,"It might work for throttle body injection, not multiport","Oh, it will fit a 1999 S-10 chev fuel pump assembly. But it won't make the correct pressure. The pressure it makes is more for throttle body injection in older S-10's. Its not enough for Multiport injection. So watch out! Don't remove the fuel tank twice and spend around $280 bucks anyway for a full assembly that works like it should. If I had known at the time, I would have bought the E3943M. I don't know who is telling these guys all these parts fit. Because they don't!"
3,Other Cartel....,"it was good to read about the other major cartel in colombia, The cartel allowed Pablo Escobar to cause Havoc and quietly but efficiently went about spreading they're tentacles around the world. A fascinating insight to the inner workings of one of the most successful drug distribution networks ever! Maybe it was me but i knocked stars off the review because of the constant flicking back and forth to the index page to remind myself of each main character of the book. But this should not stop anyone who may be interested in this fascinating subject of one of Forbes top earners!"
3,Somewhat disappointing,"This wrap is a ""one size fits all"" but if you have a 32 size waist or smaller, it will be too large. It is also quite long and feels like wearing a skirt."
5,Great phone for a great price,"For under 60 bucks this is a great value!! DSS, Caller ID, etc. You can't go wrong here at all. This phone is a much better value than the 2.4GHz models. Panasonic continues to be the best in this field(cordless phones), among many others. My only wish is that someday all the cordless phones will have internal antennas and continue to become smaller and closer to cellular sized handsets."
2,"Convenient, but low headset volume and short battery life","The phone is very convenient for the user; especially used on a belt with a headset. However, remote users complained of low, distant sound. Most disappointingly, the battery life has deteriorated quickly, and after a year it is nearly unusable."
1,Broken Bottle,"Packaging was poor, pack only in peanuts (no wrap). No fragile warning label on outside. Thermos bottle's glass was shattered before the package was opened. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!"
4,New to Computer Coloring? Pick this book up!!!,"When I first got Photoshop, intent on learning how to color my drawings in that comic book style, I didn't know where to start. So, I started surfing Amazon for computer coloring books, and bought a few. Some of them were good, some just plain awful, but of all of the ones I bought, this is certainly the best.""Digital Manga Workshop"" is an excellent introduction for amateurs looking to get their work colored via computer. It provides handy, step-by-step guides on the process, and is extremely useful. Even the novice Photoshop user (much of the book focuses on the use of Photoshop, much to my delight) will have no trouble following their instructions. I cannot recommend this highly enough."
4,This game is just a must have,"This game is great. The ports are excellent. With three huge vintage RPG's on one little cartridge, your going to play this for a long time."
1,don't get it !,"I DEFINATELY wouldn't get this unless u r a SERIOUS RPG player. The graphics are terrible and the gameplay isnt good. It gets old extremely fast.I just got it the other day and Hated it. I'm turning it in to get a Better game, and if u have it, u should 2."
3,dynamite !!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i found this season borderline, it was funny but there was definetly something missing. i also thought by this series it was more JJ'S good times, the writers also got a bit carried away with the whole 'DYNAMITE' catchphrase. It's good that all the episodes touched on real issues. the final episode is John Amos's last episode, which i didnt like because Amos was superb in his role."
5,"You can enjoy this just for the pictures, or....","Delve into these wonderful recipes that use lots of fresh ingredients to create wonderfully flavor-filled dishes that are evocative of the southwest. Great pictures, clear directions, terrific layout."
5,excellant,Loved as a kid and still do! Brought back old memories and my kids love it too! 5 stars for good clean entertainment with good morals!
2,doesn't work,The product doesn't work like people say. The smell is still there. the cat still uses that area its a waste of money don't buy the rug doctor pet stuff works better.
3,Not bad but not good.,"The best part about this game is it's title. McGrath vs. Pastrana. While the idea of mixing Freestyle Motocross and Racing into one game is great, this game lacks a lot of the qualities that make a good MX game. Handling is ridiculous, graphics are sub-par, and it just leaves you feeling empty. If you're looking for a game to mess around on to waste time, then get. Otherwise, I'd reccomend Championship Motocross 2001 w/ RC."
4,This is a Rerelease of Kickbox Yoga Fusion,"I preordered this because I really like the Patricia Moreno dvds I own. The fine print on the back of the dvd states that it is a rerelease of Kickbox Yoga Fusion, released in September 2007 and still being sold here at Amazon under that title.Kickbox Yoga FusionThis should be added to Amazon's product description. It is a great workout, but why on earth is Gaiam rereleasing it under a new title when it has been out for less than a year?"
1,Too bad it's so darn small!,"It's only 10 inches x 10 inches in width and length. Most of these hampers are at least 14 inches square. So small it's barely usable, I'd be taking clothes out before I'm ready to do laundry. Read the reviews at target.com too. I'm returning it which is sad because it's really, really cute!"
5,Best movie! Hard to find...,"I actually wanted to rent this movie by streaming, however, not one service (Netflix, iTunes, Blockbuster, etc.) offers it. Amazon is where I found a DVD for sale at a RIDICULOUSLY low price. It actually cost almost as much to ship it! Arrived when expected, in excellent condition."
1,Boring - for little kids only!,Weak sci-fi. Like Disney movies for kids. I couldn't wait until it was over! I would never watch a second time. Mork calling Orson!
2,Long and boring,"Very long. Very boring. This movie did not hold my attention very long. I made it about 1.5 hours through and realized that you were basically watching the same story being repeated over several generations in the same family. The whole ""freedom"" and ""declaration of humanity"" themes just didn't save it. It's very difficult to portray the life of a single character spanning 200 years, and ""Bicentennial Man"" didn't pull it off.The biggest problem is that the life of ""Andrew"" is portrayed so quickly, moving through time like the years are broken blades of grass, it's impossible to make a connection with the character. Once you think you may be connecting with him and feeling what he feels, BAM, the movie just skipped 16 years, and you're left with, ""Hey, wait a minute, I was just getting into that period.""Robin Williams and the special effects guys did a fantastic job. Other than that, it's just plain dumb."
2,Of course the book was better,"I've always liked Robin Williams, and I grew up reading Isaac Asimov. That's the problem. I'm sure that if you never read the novella, you really enjoy the movie. But like most people who read the story first, I can't get past the fact that the storyline was butchered for the sake of making the movie. Asimov rarely included romance in his writing, and what little he did wasn't included in Bicentennial Man. Maybe if they just called it something else, or said ""loosely based on ideas and characters created by Isaac Asimov.""For those of you who have never read Isaac Asimov's original, enjoy this movie. It has special effects and a storyline you don't already know, and one of Robin Williams's better performances. But if you've read the book, don't disappoint yourself."
3,entertaining,It was entertaining. Not great but I'm not sorry I watched it. I must type eight more words to submit
4,Early NES fighting in your hand,"Urban Champion is one of the many arcadey-styled NES games for the system. It doesn't really have any features, but the gameplay is just plain addicting.1-Player mode has you pit against a CPU player. You must punch him into a manhole to win, but that manhole's pretty far away. You have to keep punching him until he falls in. You can punch either in his face or in the gut. It depends on where he blocks himself.2-Player mode has the same setup, except that it's you're friend that you are facing.Oh yeah, and watch out for police. Who knows what they'll do if you get caught?When you win, I just find the scene to be funny, since someone from the building you're in front of cheers for your victory.Overall, it's a stellar fighting game that you might want to try out. But please note its lack of features.Now that it's on the GBA released in these cards, the appeal might increase."
2,Almost a great machine,"Great and great looking machine - Size, weight, screen dimensions, screen clarity, specs .... Great product for the price and as a package arguably better than comparable IBM and Dell.What's the hitch? They have something called a udf format for their CD/DVD drive and it doesn't read std/typical software drivers. So you try to load you printer driver or data transfer (i.e., intellimover) software to transfer data from your old computer to the Vaio and it won't read it. You need to go to another computer burn the software on a another CD for it to read it. Sony tech service says they know nothing about it, but all the trouble shooters I spoke to at these other companies (i.e., Brother, intellimover) say it's a known thing. Hated to give up the machine and some people stay with it. I gave up. Probably should be 2.5 stars."
5,an truly wonderful book.,"This is the story of the motzart that no one heard about even though she was just as talented.it is inspiring emotional book that almost any one can realte to.In that it is about feeling(and being)unappriciated,and the frustration that comes with it.Every one should read this book.It is truly inspiring."
2,rather boring after a while.,"Fun at first, but the slots are pathetic, and the game grows tiring quickly. Not to mention, they made a SERIOUS mistake/flaw in designing this game, as you can max out your charater in a matter of hours if you know how (save your game, go to the roulette, put everything on zero/double zero, if you win, holy cow do you have a lot of money. If you lose, simply restart and load your game. Continue this until you win, and have buku bucks). Enjoy this nice tip, and then be like me and grow bored of the game and disgard it."
5,It's the ONLY thing that works for pet hair,"I know it's not the sturdiest piece of equipment, but I keep buying them because they are the ONLY devices that will really get pet hair off furniture, pillows, any cloth surfaces."
1,Flimsy,"Not well made; back part keeps falling off; ""lint brush"" area is quite small. Though it works, it's not any better than lint brushes you can buy for a couple of dollars at the drugstore."
3,Breakable,It is good and works nice. It even has a way for you to easily remove the lint but be careful. It is made of weak plastic and parts will break if it hits the floor.
1,Worst Waste of Money,"This is, without a doubt, the worst workout video I've ever purchased. The instructor doesn't teach proper form, instills no power or excitment into the moves, has a boring set, and uses uninspiring, slow music. I wasn't even able to give this one away!"
4,"Not Great, not terrible either.","I heard alot of negative reviews about this cd so I almost didn't buy it. Not as bad as I thought. A little cheesy at times. Nothing like there first 5 albums which were great. But, by far is not there greatest cd either. Watch Granny run run sounds like grandpa got viagra. Of course this album was released in 1974, before viagra existed. Now I have all GFr's albums (except for there early 80's releases). Much more to Gfr than the capitol series. Very interesting band, glad I got into them. Mark Farner was very political as well. Wonder what his take would be on the happenings on the iraq war?"
3,eh.,"As a daoist that can read the chinese directly, I don't find the book very worthwhile.As a thelemite, I find that it struggles to unite thelemic concepts with daoism. It has its moments, but for the most part, you'll get what you need out of any translation you can read."
4,I'm so excited about this translation!,I feel I could study this translation for years and still find new pearls of wisdom. Truly excellent work.
1,Thelemic Tao Te Ching,"Crowley has done it again... Great work from the hallucionary one. He has come up with his own ""version"" of the Tao Te Ching and I am a practioner of the Tao for many years and his works show great misunderstandings of the Way.If you want to understand Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching, put this book aside; if you are a Crowley die-hard fan, and want Thelemic ""flavour"", this one fits well but it is not Eastern philosophy. Be warned."
1,W a r n i n g,"Warning: if you do not like clinical details into abnormal psyches, do not read this book.I was so demoralized by this book. I liked the writing style and so kept with it to the end. BUT the grisly, gory, despicable details about child abuse, torture, morbidity, etc., were disgusting! It angered me so much that I had been suckered into such a horrific tale. I HATED IT!I don't like to ever write bad reviews, but I'll never read another of this author's books."
1,Very Disappointing,"Save your money and buy a Tony Hillerman book instead. The Visitant is simply unbelievable. If the male Anasazi War Chiefs were that confused, insipid, and wimpy, it is no wonder the Anasazi died out. The book is politically correct, if you value that sort of thing (I don't). However, if you like harmless fantasies about women warriors and powerful clan matrons, you might like it."
4,For the 70s Rock Fan,"A solid collection of hits from various artists. Many of these songsreceive little or no airplay these days (2007), so the music sounds fresh.My personal favorites are tracks by Ace (featuring Paul Carrack) and TedNugent. Re-discover, reminisce, re-live, rewind, and replay...you'll doit all."
1,Where's the instrumental music?,Where is the awesome instrumental music used throughout the movie?Each climax in the movie had awesome instrumental parts in the background. I left the theatre very excited about getting this CD just for the fanfare at the end of the movie. Forget it. The instrumental music cannot be found anywhere. (I've been trying to track it down for years.)What a disappointment. I have the oldies included from other albums and venues. What a shame they didn't include the soundtrack music which is not available anywhere else.Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
1,Disappointing,"I was very excited about this product when I saw it online, because our son LOVES to be outside but the mosquitos are all over him every time we step foot outside. I didn't want to have to spray him down every time he wanted to go outside for five minutes either. Unfortunately, I have seen absolutely no difference in the number of bites he gets using the bands or going out without any protection at all. I had also bought some adult bands, which are equally ineffective. Great concept. Poor results."
4,Good for for older adults,I ordered this puzzle for my 87 year old mother in law who has shaky hands. She was able to assemble the pieces with minimal difficulty. The extra fold out photo was helpful as well. She enjoyed doing a jigsaw puzzle again and I will order more.
4,the dodgers/badfinger,John Wilson is a most gifted song writer & singer. He had a band titled the Dodgers in 1976 that featured former BADFINGER members Tom Evans (who co-wrote with the late Pete Ham WITHOUT YOU) & Bob Jackson.It's too bad that John Wilson never joined BADFINGER as he'd have fit in very well. He writes & sings some songs in a very BEATLE way. I mean that in an honest way as well.Check out his song WE ALL NEED TO BE IN LOVE & 24 reasons (co-written with Tom Evans) You won't be dissapointed.I only wish I could find more recordings by this man. He really is that good & not a bad guitar player.
3,HD????,"This is one of my favorite movies of all times. Released on BluRay, I thought I get the best of both HD and sound, well the sound is there in Tru-Dolby HD, the picture quality is unfortunately grainy. The DVD version is better."
1,nonsense,"lived in North Wales all my life; born, bred and educated. This book is about as real as Lord of the Rings. the only positive I can take from it is that he chose Wales instead of the usual American choice of Scotland and Ireland."
4,I would have given it five stars but nothings perfect,"I just completed reading the Word. Oh - my - Goddess!!! This is a fantastic read!!! A friend in Atlanta referred the author to me a couple of years ago. I am NOT a Pagan but I can relate to this book. Very spiritual.I saw the excellent reviews and the poor reviews on Amazon. Frankly, that got my attention. I read some excerpts but could find no controversial passages. So I bought it. Ouch! It is not an inexpensive book. But after reading most of it, I have decided that I will never again look at the price tag before purchasing a book that looks interesting. This is an excellent buy. There is so much information in this one book, I may never buy another craft book again! I would like to talk to Rhuddlwm about his experiences. I just returned from Europe and wish I had had enough time to see Betws-y-coed Wales. His description of the Fairy Ring allowed me to feel the energy spiral up. Does anyone know how to get in touch with him?"
1,Angry,I am Angry I Wasted so Much Money On These Books. They ARe not True. I Moved to Anglesey and Thought I Should Learn About Wales and Druids.I now Can Read Real Books who Dont Lie to ME
2,Consultants can help a non-profit.,"Readable, but seems to a little bit padded out. Whilst understanding how well your organization is managed and setting fund development plans is important its not really the topic of this book. I would have preferred more on selecting consultants and setting achievable goals."
1,Pretentious and tedious...kids immediately smell it as false,"The tedious, self-serving prose in this book reads as though the author loves the sound of his own narative voice WAY too much. His endless, conjunction-addled sentences leave smart kids looking -- aching -- for the POINT. Steig sets up a sweet and caring friendship between a mouse and a whale -- certainly an unlikely pair -- but instead of playing with the natural contrasts there, he overburdens the story with his heavy-handed voice. There is so much focus on despair and helplessness that the story bogs down...and sinks under the weight of Steig's ego."
4,Good Shoe,"These are good sturdy shoes, but are a little stiff feeling, I tend to like softer leather."
5,Pyrex 1-Quart Measuring Cup,This is a heavy duty measuring cup that will last many years. I don't like plastic.
1,Warped!,"The main reason I purchased a large Pyrex measuring cup is so I can use it for prep work, especially heating/melting ingredients. Imagine my dismay when my cup arrived and I discovered the glass is warped! A defect like this suggests production problems and I don't want to risk heating something that is already flawed which takes away my main reason for the purchase. Also, I wonder about the accuracy of the measuring lines since the warping causes hills and valleys of glass inside the cup. I guess I just spent $11 for a paperweight with storage capacity... and I still need another measuring cup!"
4,It's a measuring cup,"There's not much to say except the obvious: good brand, clear markings, convenient handle. The only drawback is its weight and bulk. Still, when buying a glass product this comes with the territory."
5,Perfect size for smaller jobs,"You can't beat Pyrex. It's tried and true. And this measuring cup in a handy size for smaller jobs. I had the 2-cup version and it just seemed to large sometimes. This is a nice, smaller size -- not so heavy since there's not so much glass. I highly recommend."
4,Good product,"I would buy another one when I need to. There are others out there, but this on is made in the USA; that's why I chose it over the others."
4,Almost perfect,Everyone should have a Pyrex measuring cup. This one is pretty classic. The only thing I don't like about it is it doesn't seem to pour as smoothly as the old ones. It's pretty easy to spill if you pour too quickly.
1,Not the same Pyrex: shatters into sharp tiny pieces,"So, my Pyrex measuring cup fell the distance of one foot onto my plain formica counter and pretty much exploded. There were sharp tiny shards everywhere -- even five feet away. It was almost impressive: I didn't know something could shatter so widely and effectively. I had to throw out the night's dinner, which was sitting on the stovetop nearby, and vacuum/mop the kitchen several times. I was still finding tiny slivers of glass days later. I don't take issue with the thing breaking: I dropped it, after all. But the way it broke makes it bad news in any kitchen."
2,Not what you would think.,I bought this Pyrex Prepware Measuring Cup thinking that it would be a great way to measure ingredients and pour them into a mixing bowl or to warm up hot water and pour it in a coffee cup filled with hot chocolate. This measuring cup doesn't pour well at all. If you are needing something to warm and pour avoid this and keep your counter tops dry. This is also true of the bigger Pyrex Prepware Measuring Cups as well.
4,Great Motorcycle Cover,"I've purchased this cover to protect my Ducati 1098 and it actually lived up to its name.The material is certainly protective over wind, sun, moisture, dust and water. It looks good and it also has cloth padding on the tail side of the bike which I believe prevents it from scratching the paint.It has one strap under the cover which allows you to wrap it around the bike - becoming very useful in windy days.I've used it in New England weather for about eight months this season; I've noticed that it eventually loses its waterproofness but it still feels very durable and no rips.So, if you have a bike that you want to protect, for the price, this is a great choice and I love the camo print :)"
5,Paper Soldiers Capture Boy's attention,"My son loves these soldiers. There are 22 historically-researched characters, with names and affiliations attached, either French or English. They are very colorful and he thinks they are a BIG step up from the usual plastic soldiers. Make believe at its best for the precocious child whose creative play goes a step beyond the norm."
4,It's only Natural,"This is a great album as well. Probably my second favorite. This album gets any vote from me because I absolutely love their version of ""Liar"". I was also impressed with their version of Jesse Colin-Young's ""Sunlight"". Of course you've got the big hits ""Joy To The World"" and ""One Man Band"" that hold the album together. One particular song that stands out on this album for some reason is a track entitled ""Heavy Church"". You'll have to pick this CD up to understand it. I also like the instrumental track ""Fire Eater"". It adds a nice touch."
1,Little of nothing,"The ""book"" is highly over overrated.It contains very little of the contant to be important and helpful for person to learn or expand the knowledge in that field."
2,Lackluster,"My fiance' is a very experienced graphic designer and artist and loves art books in general, to get ideas, inspiration and see other artist's works. This book is nice quality as far as the paper, photos and print, but I'm sorry...it's really boring. I ordered it for my fiance' for Christmas and when it arrived I opened it, flipped through it, and immediately put it back in the box for return to Amazon. I've seen some killer street art out there, and this is only about 1/4 full of anything interesting. I feel like I could have gathered the photos for this book. Seems a bit amateurish for what I think it could have been."
2,seems like a better filter but be careful,"Bought this filter and tried it in a Corolla 2005 CE, would not fit properly. The filter cover would not close and I tried applying force. Did not want to push too hard on the cover latch because it defianatly would have broke the latch. The filter seems a little too large on the lip and doesnt allow the filter box lid to close entirely. I bought a cheaper filter here on Amazon for my Corolla and it worked perfectly. Be careful with this filter; it may or may not fit."
3,It does suck air in,"I drove about 500 mi on a new filter. Based on couple of refills mileage did not improve. It is impossible to tell if engine has more power or not. I would like to believe that it does, but it could be me whipping more RPM's from the engine. Well, I hope that I don't need to wash the filter for 50K miles and it's a good thing."
3,Good idea... needs more weight,"This product helps to control the ""ringing"" that is present in a bass drum. It will not make the drum sound ""deeper"" like a feather pillow. The attachments are (2) strips of velcro that did not stick to the inside of my wood drum; so the item came loose after a week and was floating around inside the drum. It is also a bit lighter than i expected, but it will do the job in giving you control of your sound and looks better than an old pillow or towel. For that deeper sound, I changed out the single 7mil head and ordered a double ply 7mil head and that did the trick to deliver the solid deep sound that I was after."
5,Works great with large cupcake tips,"Just used this over this past weekend with Wilton's cupcake decorating set. While the large tips do not require a coupler, I liked using this one."
1,Dont Get.......East Coast Rap....,"I bought this CD trying to get into the east coast sound. Big mistake, all the tracks sound a like is just a long bore. I miss Tupac Style song...California love, I anit mad at cha... those are great song.."
1,Over-Rated,"Nas is a below average MC. Hova is the G.O.A.T--end of story. Dont waste your money on this--buy Blueprint, Unplugged, and Best of Both Worlds instead."
4,First album for Nas a HipHop classic,"No doubt about it this is the finest debut album ever made. I didn't give it 5 stars because it lacks good beats, but just listen to nas and you will know what all the hype is about. But i'm writing this in 2003 and would recommend that you buy this in the sale and listen to it and be impressed by the lyrical genius that you are listening to and then buy his latest album 'God's Son' and be totally amazed, because if one album beats this- it's that! For this album though, the lyrics you hear on this album will never quite be matched by another artist."
3,Nas who?,Y'all can't be serious about giving this album 5 stars. It's bad enough The Source magazine gave it 5 mics.
2,Nas + Illmatic = cult classic,"I can't believe how many people like this album, it's just crazy, there is'nt much to listen to on this CD, all the tracks sound the same. I was very dissapointed, i got it because of the five stars, one of the most overrated albums of all time if you ask me.Get Pac, Dre., or biggie these albums the real deal."
3,i mean it was koo,"i mean it was koo but i dont understand how people call it the greatest album ever, im sorry but all eyez on me has that label. There is only 10 songs, i mean its not even exactly a full album but it was koo. I respect nas but hes not better than 2pac. i recommed buyin this if u like rap but its not essential to your collection like all eyez on me. DONT FORGET THAT TUPAC CD PEACE!!!!!!!!"
2,2 Stars For Music Beats/5 Stars For Lyrics,"The beats on this cd are WACK! I was expecting so much more from this album since Illmatic was and is one of the best rap albums ever made. Nas' rhymes are SICK! I just hate the fact that the beats/tracks don't hold the same quality. I heard some Illmatic remixes that these NC boys did that was WAAAAY better. I mean lose your mind true hotness! If you can get your hands on those, you won't be disappointed."
5,Nas Made The Best Rap Cd Of All Time.,"People just be real you hate to admit but this is the greatist of all time. Come on N.Y. State of Mind, One Love is just the best songs in the album. So if You get this you will like it."
5,before the downfall,"the nas most people know today is a terrible rapper. lets get a few things straight, if you love pop ... then go for nastradamos but if your want some of the best hip-hop on planet earth get this. Nas has created his entire 20 years in 9 of the best hip-hop songs ever. This album is pure genious. Hip hop fan or not you must get this album at all costs..........warningavoid nas's later work except for it was written (3 1/2 stars) or stillmatic(4 stars)the rest of his stuff is badGET THIS NOW!!"
5,No words to describe.,"Just got one to say Nas is G.O.A.T the lyrics will speak themselves, and for the people that have a lower then 4 star rating on this, you people have a bad taste in music and life.Best east coast rap album of all times in my opinion."
5,Classic,"Nas, this album is amazing. i bought this album 10 years after it came out. i got it with tha anniversary edition. i always heard how good it was and it was tha best rap album out there. i listened and i just wanted more 10 songs wasnt enough. this album is hott and theres no big name apperances, no super producers like neptunes or kanyae west. jus large professor, q-tip,az and tha best nas. his lyrics r like no other. from begining to end its crazy. if yur a new rap fan or old u need this. to know where rap came from or where its goin this is where it started. with ILLMATIC"
3,OVERHYPED,Yes Nas' lyricsm on the album is very thought provoking and advanced for 94 but the production just flat out sucks. This album is overhyped. Most of the people who gave it 5 stars on here never heard of Illmatic until Stilmatic came out. The album is too short and the produciton is terrible. There are about 5 solid songs on it but the rest is just garbage. Black Moon-Enta Da Stage is a much better album for the time. Go buy that before you get Illmatic. Illmatic is a pretty good album but it doesnt deserve the five that it got in the Source. Its generally just overhyped. On NAs' part the Album is a 5 but the production is a 2.
3,"Nas is the best rappa, he out blows all","I found out about Nas when I played Tony Hawk's Underground, when I heard his ""World is Yours"" song. A week later I bought Illmatic, it was a great album. I had always liked fitty but he couldn't match Nas at all, he blew me away."
3,Did I get the same copy as everyone else?,"I dunno why there is so much praise over this album. Yes, I have listened to it. Countless times. The lyrics are typical Nas lyrics, and I the beats do nothing for me.Nas Stillmatic in my opinion is way better."
3,great debut but way overated,the lyrics are amazing but the beats are just plain wack. you can't ride around in your car to this album. It's far from being the best album in hip hop but its in the top 3 or 4 best debut in rap history...
4,rattenbury,"This is a sympathetic biography of the man responsible for Victoria (Vancouver Island's) magnificent architecture.As a non Canadian I was drawn to this book as much out of interest about the man and his architecture as the love-hate relationship Canadians seem to have with him.It is extensively researched and not only gives his background, but covers his life after his fame as Victoria's most famous architect.It is easy to read and is in fact a great story.Anyone who enjoys reading novels should not be put off by the fact that this is a biography! It has romance corruption and tragedy. This is all set at the time of the Klondike gold rush and is graphically described.You need have no interest or knowledge in either architecture or history to enjoy this."
4,Covers Everything You Need to Think About and Do,"I guess we all plan differently. Some of us circulate some of the problems within our brain and come to a conclusion without writing it down. In ""Living Your Road Trip Dream"" Phil and Carol White wrote very comphrehensively of everything a person might think of before setting out and they offer ways to think about and solve any issues.Almost half of their book is spent on the planning. It includes things I never thought about, or had already concluded before I got to what I considered the planning stage. It's an excellent book for anyone who wants to consider a long road trip--the financial aspects, how to tell your friends and family, what to take, emergency stuff, etc.Written a breezy style, it makes the trip seem possible, by taking it one step at a time.I very much recommend this excellent book!"
5,Brilliant Explanation!!,"Never, in all my many years of reading publications on Indiana commercial leases have I read anything so urbane, witty, insightful, and, yet, completely on point. The topic simply could not have been covered any more expertly. This, I tell you, is the only resource you ever will need on Indiana commercial leases!"
5,Excellent Quality and Value!,"I spent a month doing research before buying this model. I couldn't find a cheaper tractor with the same features anywhere else. By purchasing through Amazon.com, not only did I get the best price, but there was no tax and free shipping right to my garage door!I own a snow thrower and push mower by MTD and the quality is excellent. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
1,DC fan,"I have always been a dawson's creek fan, and while it really didn't matter to me who ended up with who. I must admit that the Dawson Joey moments, weather they were together or just friends where always magic. Yes, they did fight a lot, but it was no more than Pacey & Joey fought during season 4. It was moments like the graduation episode where Joey had Dawson read her the letter her mother wrote for her, or the final epside of season 4 where they kissed at the very end right before Dawson left for college. When Dawson showed up at Joeys door, at the end of the first episode of season 5 always gives me chills.While Dawson was always my favorite, and the finale was So-So,I think it was a little rushed, Williamson wrote the entire script in 8 hours, because he was working on other movies at the time. I just hope when 7th heaven ends, that finale will be much better and have a little more thought put into it."
4,"Nice, but...","Largely unnecessary with the release of season six on disc. I purchased mainly because of the rumors of low sales of season five and the possibility that there might not be a season six disc. There's nothing wrong with this disc -- it's a nice transfer, of course -- it's just that for a few bucks more you can get the whole season."
1,The Creek Finally Ran Dry,"I have not seen the extended cut of this horrible program, but I can't imagine sitting through one more manipulative minute. This show was about as bad as it could have been. Basically, Dawson's Creek ran dry after about the second season, but I stuck around...And it has finally ended. I would have given this terrible piece of trash no stars but for the merciful quality of it ending the series. They should have killed of the whole miserable bunch of them--that would have been interesting!"
5,Memories..,"This DVD is amazing, especially if you already love the series. The final conclusion is great and I loved how the music in the final episode was a culmination of the music in the series.There are few extras, but they do show tidbits of the very first episode and the parts that didn't make it to the series debut, such as Dawson's original father.I'd definately recommend this dvd to anyone who is a fan of the show."
2,Rent Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead,"I have to admit that I was a big fan of Branagh before this. I loved him in Much Ado About Nothing, and especially in Peter's Friends, but it seemed that right before this his hammy acting started taking over his personae. I think maybe him in Frankenstein ruined him on me, but this truly took the cake. He is way too over the top in this performance as the Danish prince, when so many have done better versions. I felt the film followed his lead with some bright shining moments, particularly Jack Lemmon and Billy Crystal. Hamlet is my favorite of the Bard's plays, but this was much too Hollywood for my eyes. Rent Olivier's or even Mel Gibson's version, or better still rent the very clever Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, penned by Tom Stoppard of Shakespeare in Love fame. It is the most clever movie ever made."
2,.,"Goofy and pretentious, though thorough and accurate adaptation of Hamlet. Branaugh is as silly and self-important ever, playing Hamlet (of course -- Branaugh *must* be the star) as a prissy brat, making it more difficult than usual to empathize (much less sympathize) with him and his plight. The sets are lavish and some of the other actors do quite well in their roles. Certain scenes are given interesting and creative twists, and all in all it is clear that a lot went into the making of this. That's worth something. But it isn't enough, especially once you get to the absolutely ludicrous, over-the-top climax (the climax of the play itself is fine, it's just the way Branaugh does it that's awful.) A well-intended, colorfully painted, but ultimately overrated version of Hamlet."
3,"Great movie, not so great product","This movie is fantastic; an excellent portrayal and very moving. The encoding carried by Amazon is subpar. There are several scenes with dropped frames and choppy video. Amazon has promised me that they will review the video and attempt to re-encode. Until they do, watch the film, but get it somewhere else."
5,Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet is the best!!!!!,"This is by far the best version of Hamlet and I've seen them all so I know this is the best. This version is the only one that I've seen that doesn't cut out any part of the play. It is performed in it's entirety, and even though it's a little modernistic it still holds the truest to the original play written by Shakespeare himself. Kenneth Branagh as well as the rest of the cast did an amazing job at conveying the correct emotions and staying true to the story. It is an excellent movie and everybody should see it."
4,One of my favorite movies!,"This version of Hamlet is excellent. At around four hours the movie requires some determination to watch, but if you like Shakespeare it doesn't seem like that long, really. I can't rate it a perfect 5 stars because some of the actors just shouldn't be here - Jack Lemmon is horrible, and some of the other acting is questionable, but the parts of Hamlet, Claudius, Gertrude, the gravedigger, and many others are, in my opinion, great to watch. My favorite scene is when Hamlet has the players stage his mini play-within-a-play, The Mousetrap, to confirm for himself the guilt of Claudius in old Hamlet's death. Here Branagh really shines - every time I watch it I have to rewind it a couple of times just because the scene is so fun to watch. Kate Winslet is excellent as Ophelia, especially when she begins to lose her mind. Rent the movie once at least, and if you like it as much as I did, you'll have to buy it."
4,Hamlet,I liked it but Romeo and Juliet was better. I would recommend it for most intellectuals and Shakespeare fans. It might be hard to follow for the younger crowd. Had trouble with buffering because of low provider signal so missed out on potential picture quality.
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this for my 2 1/2 year old for Halloween. The item I ordered stated the product was a size 2T. When the package arrived I attempted to put it on my child only to find out the size of the spandex suit they sent was 6 MONTHS!! It is too close to Halloween to return the costume for a new size so I will have to find something to replace the spandex suit. The shell, gloves, and boots all fit and appear to be the correct size. Do not buy from this company."
1,Burnt CD,Bought this CD thinking it was the 2006 re-release. Pretty sure someone just copied it from the original and created a CD cover. Some CD players won't even read it.
5,John Denver Xmas CD,"Wore out my last one, came very quickly, great price, highly recommend, my favorite xmas CD in my truck, merry xmas"
5,excellent painting book,Fabulous painting book.Have yet to try the lessons but the instructions are set out clearly and will be easily followed.The quality of the paper in the book make it a must for art students.
4,Romanov Paper Dolls,"This set of paper dolls are wonderful. With beautiful clothes full of detail it is easy to relive the life of the ill-fated Romanovs. The set includes the Tsar Nichols and the Tsaritsa Alexandra. There is a younger verison of the two (when they were married) and an older version of the two. Also there are the beautiful Grand Duchesses Olga,Tatiana,Marie, and Anastasia. Also the tsarvitch is included.With easy to understand and informative notes I highly recommend this book to paper doll lovers or people who are fans of the Romanovs."
5,"""Good and Scary Film""","""Halloween 5"" was released in 1989 on a budget of $3,000,000 and eventually made close to $12,000,000 at the North American box office. Still most fans and critics hated ""Halloween 5"" as the horror genre of the 1980's began to wane as people were getting tired of the same stories being featured in ""Halloween"", ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Friday the 13th's"" franchises. By 1989 the horror and good writing fell to the wayside as studios simply wanted to draw in the box office crowd to make money.In this outing Michael Myers, again, returns to town to do some killing. Not much is new here in terms of plot, but the death sequences are mind-blowing and the finale original."
2,"Halloween 5 is not as ""Halloween"" as the rest",In the 5th installment in the halloween series Mike is back and with a vengence (and a new mask) Where he continually stalks his neice in a mental institution. This sequel is a totally unnecessary and is a disgrace to the others in the series. (It also has way too many endings) On the good side it is scary and features a brlliant performance by a young starlett (Danielle Harris) Worth a Rent and a must for fans.
4,THIS ONE WAS ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST!,THIS ONE WAS SCARY.THE WRITER WAS REALLY CREATIVE HAVING DANIELLE HARRIS HIDE IN THE LAUNDRY SHOOT AND MICHEL TRYING TO STAB HER FROM THE OUTSIDE.THAT WAS REALLY FREAKY.AND IT WAS COOL HOW DANIELLE COULD FEEL WHEN MICHAEL WAS GOING TO KILL SOMEONE.ANYBODY WHO LIKES GOOD THRILLERS GET THIS ONE AND YOU'LL WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN.PREPARE TO GET FREAKED OUT BEFORE WATCHING THIS MOVIE.REALLY SCARY!
1,No sir i did not like it!!,"It was a very cheesy movie. The whole story about Michael and Jamie having that psychic link thing was very lame,and very UNREALISTIC!!!"
3,An okay movie.,"Honestly, I didn't enjoy this one at all. I thought some of the acting could have been better."
3,Still pretty good,"This movie had ""great last movie"" written all over it but unfortanately it wasn't. This movie picks up where 4 left of but unlike 1 and 2 Meyers waits a year before going after heis niece once more. Its a rutine horror filck but had the set up to be a good horror flick, but overall it still works."
2,Five times a charm?,"I don't think so...Though this one was pretty ok, it did not prepare us for it's AWFUL sequel, The Curse...I did not like this film at all. It lost pace half way through and what is with Michael's hair?"
2,Halloween 5 - in search of a plot,"I loved Parts 1,4,7 but I must say this one reached a low, the same low that part two did. It has undertones of a ""jason"" type movie and the plot does not make sense when you think about it and also the mysterious way they set up for a sequel was tacky. VERY tacky. The ending was not brilliant, it was stupid, and involved unexplained characters (circular reference to nonsensical plot). Definitely not as good as 1, 4, or 7 (H20). Watch it if like me, you must see every piece of drivel associated with a long running story, but if you want a thriller get either 1 or 4, if you want closure get 7 (H20)."
5,SUSPENSE RITE,THE 2ND BEST MOVIE IN THE SERIES THIS ONE HAS THE DARKNESS AND ATMOSPHERE THAT 1AND 2 HAD THERES SO LITTLE GORE THANK GOD THERES A BRIEF BRIEEF NUDE SCENE THAT MOST DONT EVEN NOTIVE MICHALES HANDS ARE BURNT AND DEFORMES MAKES IT CREPIER WE SEE A CREEPYER SIDE OF MICHAL AND THE MASK GREAT
3,"Not as good as Halloween 1,2,or 4.","I think that this movie was made simply to make money. I am a HUGE fan of these movies, and I think this was the worst of all of them. There are to many senseless killings. Michael is supposed to be going after his relatives (in this movie, his niece Jaime). But in this sequel he goes off and kills a bunch of (extrememly annoying) teenagers that are in no way stopping him from getting to Jamie. I feel that this was the worst of the series."
3,Good but not as good as part four,Part five does not have the atmosphere as part four but it keeps the mood the film starts off wih a quick recap. The main reason this film does not succeed as well as part four is because Dwight Little was not the derector some french guy was and he made this the goriest so far (Later sequels got even gorier)this was a fun sequel with some scary scenes (the luandry shoot and Tina being all by her self after the party)Killing off Rachel was a mistake (Mostapha Akkad said killing of Rachel was the bigest mistake in the series) I really liked her charecter in part four but the film is still good I would recommend it if youre a Halloween fan
3,creepy but no where as good as 12 4,this one was scary fun a fun slasher adventure 1 2 4 were way better but it was fun and had a decent plot worth watching.
4,a lost jem,"I was a bit sceptical about purchasing this book but glad I did.The intelligence department in first world war theatre were the cream of the British army (in Africa) and did some pretty amazing feats of reconnaissance work. The author being present.It was the first modern jungle guerrilla war i.e. machine guns armoured cars,et, and the British had a worthy opponent in the Ascaris, tribesman trained and led by Germans in modern warfare tactics.Well written and entertaining also not many books let alone accounts in existence."
2,.,"Overrated. The movie really loses force, clarity, and credibility in the last 45 minutes or so, and some of the ""harshly funny truths"" of the film are too gimmicky to be fully appreciated. That isn't to say that there aren't some impressive flourishes of style and a sense that there may be some real talent behind this. But I found this film a bit disappointing on the whole. Solondz's next film, Happiness, is far superior."
1,Depressing stuff,"I rented this movie because I had been told by some friends that it was a great black comedy. I fail to see any comedy in this movie whatsoever. Instead, I found myself dragged into the misery of the main character and her despicable family. It was a compelling idea, no doubt, but Solondz would have been well served to lighten this movie up a little bit."
4,Oh my God! This was my life!!,"Well, not exactly. This movie sure does resurrect the woes of a product of suburban dreariness. I loved this movie because it is told very simply, no over-the-top acting, explosions or SFX. Just a summary of the life of an 11 year old geek, whom I'm very surprised still has the will to live!"
2,The absolute worst quality dvd transfer i have ever seen.,"I was extremely disappointed at the poor quality of the DVD transfer on this title, very blurry soft images, shaking picture, pixelated and extremely annoying to view. It is like viewing a non HD television channel on an hd Television. The quality on my VHS version of this film is much better which is ridiculous. The people who transferred this film should be ashamed, they have ruined a great film by doing a cheap low quality transfer. Beware if you enjoy a good sharp DVD quality picture, this title fails completely as a DVD!"
4,Disturbingly excellent,"This is a greatly disturbing American film. One watches this film laughing all the way through, while simultaneously shocked at the provocative and deeply disturbing character interaction one sees. Welcome to the Dollhouse is a satire of the stereotype of the American condition. It challenges us to look beyond what 1950's television told us what is the American family. This film should be seen. If you liked American Beauty, this film is similar to it, although it is far superior. Its strength lies not only in its writing and acting, but also in its humility. A great film for the serious thinker and casual movie viewer alike. Deserves its R rating."
4,Jan Brady Lives,"First off, whoever thinks this is ""the worst movie ever"" should stick with Hollywood cookie-cutter comedies....maybe you'll ""get"" those.Anyway, this IS a comedy, believe it or not. You might not be laughing all the way through, but I'll bet you'll at least have a smile...and maybe you will laugh all the way through the second time you see it.Heather does an EXCELLENT job here in portraying Dawn Weiner, and the other cast-mates also turn in fine performances...but enough about the actual movie content...This DVD is double-sided, one side being full-screen, the other being widescreen (letterbox). There are brief bios of the director, and the two actors playing Dawn Weiner and Brandon, the boy that initially torments her. Also included is the movie trailer.If you like this film, you might be interested in Todd Solondz later efforts, ""Happiness"" and ""Storytelling""."
3,Pretty Weak!,"I have bi-polar disorder, and I will say that this is a fair history of manic depression. For that alone I give it three stars. The actors in this half hour documentary seem to overdo the disorder. It would be funny were it not so tragic."
1,What a boring book.,I have to agree with the recent reviewers. Star could have been so much better. I got literally sick of how much people fawn over the main character. I'm not understanding why there's a film made out of this either.
2,"Only parts of it are good, but most of it is boring","The story revolves around the strikingly gorgeous Crystal, who is an aspiring actress. She goes through a lot of tragedies and grief, but remains determined to make her dream come true no matter what.Some of the book is good, like when Crystal first moves to San Francisco. Although I didn't want her to leave Boyd and Hiroko behind, since they were the only people who truly cared about her (other than her father).Most of the book was boring though, like the relationship between Crystal and Spencer. There was always something keeping them apart, even after they kept finding each other, and it started to get old after a while.It took me a long time to read this, because I would get sick of it so easily, but I eventually finished it. In the end I still like Danielle Steel, but this one isn't a favorite."
4,Not really a fan of this style or of Plastic Man but...,"I am not really a fan of either Plastic Man or of Kyle Baker's over the top Ren and Stimpy-esque cartoon style. However, I had to pick up the plastic book with Plastic Man all over it so that it looks like you are actually holding Plastic Man trying to hide out as the book itself!Once I started reading this one, I must admit that I got into it. The artistic style grew on me and Plastic Man became less annoying (sort of...). This one is full of lots of sight gags and off-color comments and references.I was entertained and that's all that counts. I give it a ""B""."
5,DVD captures the excitement of this band; tons of material,"This DVD captures the excitement of a live performance of Franz Ferdinand. For the price, you get a ton of material. Disc one has live performances from around the globe, a documentary, and some interesting and fun ""easter eggs"". Disc two has two full live concerts. Well worth the price. The next best thing to having Alex, Nick, Bob and Paul play in your living room."
4,CIPA mirror review,Not much to say- it sticks on and works fine. I did prefer the older designs with the sheet metal backing over the current plastic ones.
2,Maybe not..,"I just received this blender, and it came missing the middle piece of the lid. In addition, the jar did not sit sturdy in the base and was therefore very wobbly, as well as feeling really cheap. After reading a couple of reviews saying theirs had died after several months of use, and the bottom of the box that said it's made in China, I say ""no thanks."""
4,Kalorik BL-16909,"A very good blender for the price. Much better than similar priced Oster,Hamilton Beach etc. Motor is powerful and not too noisy. Only criticism is that it only has 2 settings, high and low."
2,Makes a mess,"I used my new blender for the first time today to make blender hollandaise. I have done this many times with other blenders and have had no problems. Today, I put the egg yolks in the blender, put the top on and took off the locking cap to pour in the butter. When I started it, the yolks came flying out the top. I had to put my hand over the opening to try to pour the butter in. Neadless to say, the hollandaise was horrible. Does anybody know if I did something wrong? Has anybody else had this problem?"
1,Do not buy this Blender!!,"Bought it in April, had to return first one because of no lid. (Amazon was GREAT and sent another one very quickly)Second One blended ok, but sounded horribly loud! Then in August small ball-bearing sized metal pieces and sharp metal slivers started showing up in our food!! I called the Kalorik service #, and they told me I had to BUY new blades. Would not listen to any reasoning about the dangers of the machine. WOULD NOT REFUND or REPLACE.DO NOT BUY THIS BLENDER!"
2,Ok...except for Alec Baldwin's narration.,"In general, my kids love Thomas. We love the books (we have the super-huge treasury, among others), and the other videos are usually fine. However, this one drives me NUTS. Alec Baldwin's voice acting here is horrible. He makes all of the characters sound like spoiled brats, thus changing the tone of the whole video to a negative, whiny experience. All of the engines sound the same - snobbish and rude, even when speaking common, every day phrases. Not only does this make me really dislike this video, but I worry about my children mimicking his attitude.Look for the videos with the other voice actors - they do a MUCH better job of portraying childlike behavior without making you cringe. (Ringo in particular does a great job.) We like this video, but it does not get as much play as the others, simply because of the narration. Get it, but don't pay too much for it."
3,"Not the Best, Not the Worst","Make Someone Happy is a decent video with a few decent episodes. Alec Baldwin narrates, and his narration has pros and cons. The pros are the narration itself, is rather good and Baldwin does give characters creative character voices but the cons are that some episodes aren't that exciting and Baldwin does make James sound like a sterotypical gay man. But those Chinese Dragon and eye rolling complaints or full of crap. The Chinese dragon never said anything and all the engines roll their eyes to make up for the fact that their mouthes don't move! Happy Ever After, James and the Trouble with Trees, and A Suprise For Percy are the best episodes on this Thomas & Friends release."
2,Cut to the chase already!,"Ok - was looking for somewhat ""general"" study material for a newly formed small group. It is just that, general and average. The music choice on the DVD is awful, and became a running joke in our group. Andy Stanley rambles and talks too much to get the basic point across that one should always stop and ask themselves, ""What is the wise thing for me to do,"" prior to taking action on something. While this is an important and valid point, the study asks this question repeatedly in a mundane series of examples."
1,Lame Excuse for a Probe Thermometer,"First, the probe is junk--it failed on the second use. Second, the thermometer wasn't designed by anyone who's ever cooked meat...the auto-off feature means you won't hear any temperature alarm you've set unless you constantly poke at the buttons to keep the unit on (or more likely, you'll discover your meat's temperature by the thick, black smoke leaving your grill). Finally, the magnets on the back aren't even strong enough to hold the unit on a refrigerator! How a product this poorly designed and built made it to market is beyond my understanding."
2,Don't buy it if you need the magnet,"Unbelievably the 2 magnets won't even hold-up the display's own weight, without the probe connected!You'd think they would have actually tried it once after designing it.I did give it 2 stars because it works and I like the beeper's sound. I haven't had it long enough to see the probe start to read high as others have said, but reading high is definitely a bad way for it to fail since you'll get undercooked food."
3,Good features but the probes fail,"I like the features of this product, but like others here I have had the tempuratuer probe fail afer a few months of use on two separate units, either stuck on high or become eratic and obviously inaccurate. I only use it to measure meat tempuratures so don't think I abused it."
1,Don't bother,"Probe is junk. Wears out too easily. It's hard to replace, too expensive when you can find it. Manufacturer does reply to emails to customer service. Buy something other than Trutemp or it's parent company Taylor."
5,Not Free SF Reader,"A really pretty decent anthology, given I remember it decades later, with several good stories. Not quite a 3.50.Spectrum 5 : Student Body - F. L.

5,The Human Factor,"The Human Factor is a unique book. It provides a philosophical approach to a problem within our society that we have not been able to solve. This book will challenge every individual to really examine themselves and look deeper into what life truly has. I fully recommend this book to anyone looking for a different kind of approach to life.Thank you,Mohammed Alasady"
5,Heavy As Christian Gets!!!,"This is the second Impending Doom album I bought, though I'd heard songs from it on myspace and such, I still was stunned by this album, it is amazing. Very heavy, and very strong Chritian message. If you like grind, or death metal, I suggest check this out."
4,Wish I Had Read It Years Ago,"I wish I had read this book years ago. For those who want to be able to effectively deal with the challenges of working in an organization, this book can be a great overview. While it is almost an advertisement for the firm which the authors own which helps troubled firms, it can also serve -- if read and studied very carefully -- as a great way to develop one's own approach to office politics, and the myriad complexities of trying to fit in and advance within a big, competitive business work group. Book repeats things but also mentions that thoughts need to be repeated and repeated to be correctly and fully learned."
4,Good value for the money,"The response time of this thermometer is pretty decent in its price range: it goes from freezing to boiling (or back) in about 15 seconds.The measurement range is OK -- at a maximum of 302 F you won't be able to use it for deep frying or melting sugar, but it's more than sufficient for measuring meat/pastry doneness.All in all it's a decent choice if you just want a basic unit for everyday tasks. If you need auto-off or a Celsius mode, look at similar Taylor models for a little bit more.The next significant step-up is the Thermoworks really-instant Thermapen at a whopping $80 (sold under the name ""Digital thermometer"" on Amazon - see B0001VWRCC)."
4,meh,"A New DAY - Awesome. I loved it.f.U. - It's pretty good.Dimension Intrusion- This is a really, really good track.Another Time (Revisited) - The best on the CD, by far, IMO.Substance Abuse - This is the best acid techno song I've ever heard.Everything else is only mediocre, but those tracks well make up for the uninspiring rest."
5,sneaky boss,my boss will never sneak up on me again :) should be used for a car but great to put on the corner of your monitor o see behind you
2,"lightweight plastic, but scuffed in the packaging","lightweight plastic, would be shiny and clear, but scuffed in the packaging, probably from being stacked or under a heavier object at some point."
3,It does the job,"I've been using this on my monitor in my cubicle at work for over a year now. It has fallen off a few times, the adhesive on the back isn't the greatest over time but when it falls off, I've just put it back up and it has stayed for quite a while. I don't quite get the field of view on this that I would like since the mirror is only about 2 inches wide."
2,Mirror surface is scuffed,"As others experienced, the mirrored surface was slightly scuffed inside of the package. Simply the movement of the mirror against the plastic packaging scratched it. It's like chromed plastic instead of glass, so that's why its easily marred. I highly doubt it could withstand the rigors of the environment if stuck on a car door mirror. More suited for inside applications, like using it as a computer monitor mirror."
3,It is what it is..,"I got these, of course, because I had to have em' to play my NES. They work & are cheap thus the 3 stars. However, you'll find they make gameplay 1000x more difficult & frustrating than a REAL controlpad. It's now become a fact of life that I can't do the same things in my fave games than before & funny I find myself altering play around the crappiness of the pads. Oh well, better than not playing I guess."
2,Not the same....,Wasn't the same as the original controllers and cheaply made. I already broke the two that I got after playing about 30 hours
4,Good entry level screen,Product was easy to install and reasonably priced. It provides a good picture quality for the money. I think the biggest fault is the lack of adeuqate instructions on how to set the down set point and the screen can't be configured to automatically raise/lower with the on/off of projector.
1,"CAUTION ! Good cast, HORRIBLE PLOT, HORRIBLE ACTING!","I can't believe it. Sutherland, FOnda and Ann-Miller, altough not big stars, are, without any doubt, very respectable actors to make such a lousy picture. Maybe the director is to blame, for having extracted such sleepy performances from the actors. Ann-Miller's character is totally empty, no purpose at all. Fonda is totally unconvincent as the deaf beaten woman. Kiefer Sutherland seems to be only waiting for his paycheck and his partner cop (don't know his name), who acts as the ""bad cop"", is ludicrous."
1,Worse than mediocre,"Worse than mediocre thriller about an abused wife who goes on the lam after she is linked circumstantially to the death of her husband and sister. Determined to prove that her husband is alive she follows leads across the state, her peril increasing at each stop. Chasing after her are the traditional `good-cop' and `bad-cop' pair of partners. One is convinced of her innocence the other more interested in closing the case and getting home. This pair is often able to corner their suspect but never quite to capture her. All the main players meet up in a remote town in the desert and the truth begins to unfold with deadly consequences for some.Wow! This was a bad movie. The lead acted as if she was tranquilized, The cops couldn't find a suspect if he or she is in the police station (this happens twice) and everyone else is as one-dimensional as can be. Avoid this one at all costs."
3,Fonda is great and Sutherland is mostly silent,this is about Bridget Fonda..she loses her memory because of her abusive husband..Kiefer is the cop trying to protect her..not a bad movie.. I liked it because of the leads..though can you say that Kiefer was mostly silent in this one...and the guy whos the wife beater should burn in eternal hell..first saw this on Fox because they always..mostly air movies on the weekends and this was one of them.
3,"Sorry X-Box-ers, CS Has failed on this console","I have played CS for 6 years and when I tried to played CS on xbox I just about gagged and fell over, I cannot stand the controls. I do have to give kudos for trying but I didn't like it at all.At heart CS is a mouse and keyboard game, and with the min specs for cs being 250MHz and 64MB ram for lan games (HL 1.1.0.0, CS 1.5) there isn't much of a excuse for playing it on a console than a PC (unless you havent gotten a new computer since 1996)Price comparason:PC: $10 (Half-Life can be found in the bargin bin then download CS from somewhere that has CS 1.5 or 1.6; or buy CS retail {not CS:CZ} for the same price at Wal-Mart/Fred Meyers)X-Box: $20-35Choice is clear: PC wins"
1,A waste of money if you don't have X Box Live,"I saw this game and thought it might be fun, as I enjoy games like Ghost Recon; however, I was very disappointed. There is not much you can do with this game unless you have X Box Live. The single player missions are pretty boring and you will get tired of them within the first 15 minutes or so. I don't have X Box Live, so I can not comment on the game play online.Pros: None that I could see. There are better first person shooters out there.Cons: Lack of game play offline. Graphics were not the best and the IA was not very intelligent.Overall: Try Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six, or some of the other Tom Clancy 1st Person shooters."
1,CS for Counter-Strike,"If you have CS for PC don't get it for Xbox,the campaign missions suck. Only get it if you have Xbox Live. The AI Cpu's are dumb. CS for Xbox is a big dissapointment!!"
2,Don't hate me CS fans,"I'm gonna keep this short and sweet. Counter-Strike on Xbox is just barely ok. Only buy this game if you have Xbox Live, that is where a bulk of the action is. If you own CS on PC, don't buy the game."
4,Atleast it ACTUALLY works,"This is probably the first time i got a used game with very few scratches like this, this one doesn't have any scratches at all. It's great!!!!"
3,Beware...need medium coupler,"These are are large pastry tips. For me, that was not a probem since I didn't want them for fine work. What was a probem was that the ""better bought together"" couplers were 4 small couplers, competely incompatable."
3,Two different sizes!,"Note, these tubes in this set are two different sizes. Three of them have a 3cm diameter base, and three of them have a 3.5cm base. When I bought a large coupler to use with these, it will only fit the 3 smaller tubes. Frankly, I don't know what coupler will fit the larger ones, but I'd love to know.They seem to work fine, but there's a good chance that if you don't have this information you won't be able to use them all."
4,Ateco tubes need Ateco couplers,These are 2 different sizes of large pastry tips and needs Ateco medium and large couplers. I am very pleased them. I use zip lock bags instead of pastry bags.
2,Better books are available,"I bought this book shortly before it was replaced in the ""Colloquials"" series. Since I'd bought it, I decided I'd work with it for awhile. It's notable mostly for what it doesn't have- a key to the exercises, so you have an idea if you're going in the right direction or not. The solution- get another book! The tape part is good and clear, a point in its favor. It might be worth having as a supplement to some more checkable reference."
1,He talks over the music,"He talks over the music. Do they try to make people buy a CD or should people download to compensate for the loss? When he was talking, it also made me realize that his music is probably pretty boring so the talking is somewhat compensating."
3,Just OK,"My 17 mo daughter received this as a gift. She is very excited about taking a bath with Pooh and Piglet but doesn't end up playing with it much when she is in the tub. Piglet does not float upright but she really doesn't mind. What she really likes is getting a ""shower"" from the froggy which Piglet is floating on and likes the routine of kissing Pooh and Piglet good night when it is time to get out of the tub."
3,Appalling book design,"A very fascinating, original book with a thoughtful text and illuminating photographs. It was definitely not intended to help you design your French Country summer house! I would have given it five stars, except that I've never seen a book designed so poorly that it was almost impossible to read. The photographs and their captions were nowhere near the corresponding text. Often it was difficult to tell what caption went with what photograph. Some photographs were missing captions. I spent a lot of time flipping back and forth as I read, trying to find the photographs being described in the text or vice versa. There were several pages where the text was in a light color over a background of a photograph, only readable with a very strong light or a magnifying glass. A great deal of thought had obviously gone into the writing, the translation, and the selection of illustrations; it was a shame that the material was handled this way. I am surprised at Thames and Hudson."
4,Good Book,This was a very good book with lots of detailed information. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the military.
4,Easy to Use/Easily Tolerated,"This product is easy to mix into my daughter's milk or yogurt and doesn't seem to upset her stomach. It is a nice alternative to cod liver oil which can really upset a little one's stomach. My only complaint is that when shaking milk to mix it up, it does become quite foamy and takes a while to settle."
3,somewhat disappointing,"My main complaints about this book are that the characters, via their dialogue, were rather two dimensional. There just wasn't much about the person that ever came through to bring me into the story. I couldn't empathize with the characters because I couldn't get into their heads. Just too wooden.The technical stuff about guns, the training and to some degree the action sequences were good, but they just couldn't save this book from being anything other than mediocre.A far better, though longer and more involved, book to recommend and compare with would be Unintended Consequences. Far better character development, I think."
2,Netgear GS605 v2 Failed after 3 Years,"My Netgear GS605 v2 worked well for a little over three years. Then I suddenly noticed problems streaming music and video from the NAS which connects to my home network using this switch. The transmission rate fell so low that music could only be streamed for a few seconds at a time before it had to be re-buffered. At first I suspected WiFi coverage issues at the player endpoints, but then I noticed that the one computer hardwired via the GS605 experienced significant performance degradation whenever accessing remote files. I thus tried circumventing the switch and all file transfer performance in our home network went back to normal. Since this switch cannot be configured, I have to assume it is broken. I just wish it had failed by stopping to function altogether. Since it degraded performance, this very basic switch was the last thing I checked after troubleshooting our WiFi, the player HW, player SW, NAS, and server SW."
5,Just what's needed to open up another room to your wired network.,"I have two Netgear Gigabit switches - one eight port I've had for a few years and this new five port I just purchased a couple months ago. Both have performed exactly as I'd hoped. I have pulled a CAT6 cable under my house from one to the other so these two serve as the backbone of my network. They're small, so they can fit into a small niche on a desk or a shelf (or TV stand) and they're quiet, they're fast, and most importantly they're reliable. I have a HTMini on my TV with external drives hooked up to it, and I have a PowerMac G5 acting as NAS in my office. Each serve up media and files just about as fast as a local disk to the other machines on the network. It's a thing of joy."
5,"No hassles, good price","There's not much to say other than the switch works as advertised the first time and every time. No set-up other than plugging it in was required for my simple application. I also really appreciate the ""green"" transformer-less power adapter that Netgear supplies as it is very compact and saves lots of energy."
2,Drops to 100TX from gigabit speeds,I just replaced two of these at home with 5 port trendnet gigabit switches instead.When initially started I would see gs605v2 provide gigabit speeds but either pc copying files would only use 20% of the available gigabit speed as reported by windows 7 networking tab on task manager. Frequently one pc would drop to 100TX speed and the other pc would see 8% network activity when copying files to / from the other.Both gs605 switches would become hot to the touch when left on for long periods of time. Both were left in well ventilated areas.So I replaced these with the trendnet switches instead and now I see 47% network utilization. I use cat 5e cabling and now copy files at roughly 2gb/minute where before I would see ~ .5 gb/ minute.
1,trigger finger sucks,"using PC SP3,ableton 7,reason 4,komplete 6 with battery 3 etc.enigma is a joke for programming assigning drums, its like EVERYTHING ELSE M-AUDIO does for software,half a$$d support,and NO Detailed Instructions...so be prepared to sign up for COUNTLESS forums on how to use it...i have to put the same question on diff forums to get a straight answer (ableton,propellerheads-reason,m-audio) the best one is Etechdocs...they actually have a nice tutorial,programs only Sometimes recognize it,im always reloading the drivers.....dont buy it, in fact, Boycott m-audio, im never buying any of their trash again!!Akai mpd24, or mpd32 is a better buy"
4,From the author,"One of the reasons that I never rely on Amazon.com for research or opinions is because of the random nature of both the ""Editorial Reviews"" and ""Customer Reviews"" posted here. That a book published 20 years ago and republished in paperback in 1990 still carries just these three reviews gives an idea of the sad state of a world run by computers, polls, everyone's an expert mentality, and near-random searches.Andrew Patner, author, I.F. Stone: A Portrait"
4,Spiritual Direction for a Spiritual Life,"The author, Henri J.M. Nouwen, is a Catholic Priest and writer. In this book he outlines three stages of spiritual growth: reaching out to one's self, then to others, and, finally, to God. He offers examples from literature, scripture, and life to help listeners through struggles with inner restlessness of faith.Erik Synnestvedt narrated the unabridged audiotapes I had. Anyone from any walk of life that has an interest in understanding a Christian's spiritual life can benefit from this book. Do your self a favor and read/listen to this small book."
5,Great Quality Super Fast Shipping,"All I can say is that the Quality, Price and Service that KTG Online gave me with this order was outstanding.This desk exceeded my expectations by about $40. I would guess that in a mall type retail environment that I would expect to pay around $75-$95 plus tax. (just a guess)Great Item A ++++Thanks"
1,Unhappy - keeps dying,I bought this product in 1/06. The LCD & audio to the speakers died by within 9 months. I had it repaired and it died again a little more than a year later. Now it's out of warranty. There is no servicer nearby so I'd have to mail it in and it's not small. What a waste of money and time!
3,SuSE Linux 9 Bible is good for the newbie,"I purchased this book because I am moving to Novell SuSE Linux Professional 9.2 from RedHat Linux 9 Professional. I wanted something new instead of migrating to RedHat Workstation or Fedora. SuSE Linux 9 Bible gives good detail on installation using YaST. The book goes through disk partitioning, the fundamentals of the Linux System, RPM packages, networking, administration and desktop customization. I thought the book was better than RedHat Linux 9 Bible which I purchased 2 years ago. The book comes with Linux 9.1 on a CD. This is good for a newbie to mid-level administrators. If you are doing anything fancy you can get the official Novell SuSE Linux Professional 9.2 User and Administration Guides on-line and in PDF format. SuSE is an exceptional Linux System and with Novell and IBM's backing could tip the scales away from RedHat Linux. I give it ""Daumen Oben"" (""thumbs up"" in German)."
5,Great music,"Although there is much music missing on this soundtrack, it is still a great soundtrack to listen to. And yes, you can say that it is ""so seventies"", but: That's whats fun about this soundtrack.It has great sounds on it that give you the feeling of the movie. My personal favorite is ""Bond 77""Also the title song, ""Nobody does it better"" is one of the best title songs in the Bond history.The soundtrack also includes music that wasn't used in the film. The track ""Anya"" was never used in the movie, but it has beautiful music that really touches my heart.If you liked the feeling you got from the movie because of the music, this is a soundtrack for you.But you have to listen to it yourself and make your own opinion. But I think it has some of the greatest music in the entire Bond series. Nobody does it better ;)"
5,The good sort of pain,"Cartoon genius Tim Kreider does here what he does best - political critique. Certainly not for Republican sorts, this collection is eight years' worth of brilliant spite."
2,Like Georgette Heyer???,"I bought this book because of the 'like Georgette Heyer' description and was disappointed. I did NOT think this was a clean book, and I was not happy with the hero's morals, because he had no problem thinking of his past life and the various females he had behaved badly with, also no problem thinking of behaving badly with current females!I believe in most people's estimation this book was 'clean' but I thought the insinuations and the moral charactor, as well as the description of the love scenes to be too much."
2,Casual walkers should skip this one,"The unilaterally good reviews for this book are what led me to purchase it in advance of my recent trip to the UK. However, I was disappointed to find that there was virtually no info that would be useful to a casual walker/hiker such as myself. The 'short walks' listed are 6-8 hours long, while the 'long walks' are multi-day adventures. There are virtually no routes given for the majority of walkers who are looking for more manageable 1-3 hour afternoon walks. We found the TI maps in each town to be far more helpful, and there are also books out there with a wider variety of walking choices. I ended up ditching this book in a B&B at the end of my stay - hopefully a more hardcore walker will stumble across it and find it useful."
1,nokia N75 failed to startup contact the retailer in 90 days :(,"I have used Nokia phones for past eight (8) years. Never had an issues with the phones, well until now... :( Purchased phone in June 2010 and in October 2010 it started to freeze up on me and then it gives me Phone failed to startup contact the retailer. So I did, Nokia gave me steps to reset it, still same error. I called reseller ""unlockedcellphonekings"" they told me sorry 90 days has passed nothing we can do. I called Amazon Customer Service, same comment nothing we can do sorry.It is unfortunate to pay over $100, and have an item un-operational in 3 months.If you buy the phone see if you can by a warranty.I am not sure if I buy another Nokia again... :("
2,13 and God,"German hip hop mixed with electronica. In all honesty it didn't work for me. The meloncholic tunes of The Notwist and Console are clear and strong with seemingly definite direction from Martin Gretschmann, then suddenly there is a ridiculous outburst of rap from an individual sounding somewhat like a bad Primus or Residents album. If the desire to experiment with electronica still exists in Germany I suggest they stick with the concepts begun by Oval. As a colsolation track two ""Men of Station"" is one of the best Notwist/Console songs I've heard since Pilot, in fact it's better. The decision then is this, is the album worth a majority of crud in exchange for a small amount of beauty? For an individual such as myself it most definitely was."
3,"Great story,,, only if it were completed,,,","I read PSME in Japanese from comic books, then saw this movie. I was so excited to watch every episode, only to realize that this is not done completely! It ended just when all the interesting part of the story was about to evolve. I felt sad, but thinking that there must be another DVD for the later part. My hope turned into disappointment when I learnt that there was any more!!! I strongly recommend viewers to find a way to read comic books of PSME since the story is a lot deeper and more exciting."
4,Great beginning of the year read aloud.,"Great story about acceptance, being at peace with one's self and going against the odds.I loved it and so did my students. We will forever remember Zinkoff!"
5,LOSER!!!,"Have you ever seen or heard of a boy, who was just there, standing in the backround? Well in this book LOSER, there is a loser, his name is Donald Zinkoff. He is a kid who does not care what people say, or think of him...... but as he gets older he starts to notice and care what people say about him.... CAN'T SAY ANYMORE! Donald (loser) is a funny and cool charactor. Thoughout the book you become to like Donald more and more! i would reccomend this book to all ages!-MAdi"
4,Is he really a Loser?,"I read Loser. I thought it was a really well written book because I thought that he did a good job explaining Zinkoff and his family in the story. Zinkoff wears a tall giraffe hat to school on the first day. His teacher tells him to take it off and put it in his cubbyhole but he doesn't want to. So he puts it on the floor next to him. At recess he brings it outside. The older kids take it away from him, but Donald Zinkoff doesn't care at all. I think kids ages 9 to 10 will like to read this book."
3,loser,"This book was a very strange book. When i say strange I mean it in a good. I just would think that someone wouldn't write about such a odd Character. The main Character is Zinkoff he is slightly disabled. So in this book it shows his first day of school and how it went. But he didn't understand school, he just wasn't smart. All through this book he went up against dangerous odds and just didn't take it serious and thought it was a joke."
2,Loser,"by Brandt,CALoserThe book Loser is one of those annoying books that either your teacher forces you to read, or you are attracted to it for one weird reason or another. Either way, you'll fall into a pit of doom! This is simply a strange and down right boring read.The first strange thing that I noticed was that the book was written in third person and present tense. This ugly combo creates something like this: ""He walks over to the water fountain and takes a drink."" ahem, Boring!!!! I mean come on, who writes a book like that?No offence to the author. Really, peace on earth. And for that matter I give the author credit for the fact that they wrote the book. And that some parts were sort of interesting. Notice the word some. Anyway I guess that this is just an oppinion thing.So be sure understand. If you happen to like books about... well... losers who must survive the dark clutches of school.(Yea Right) Then give it a shot. And everyone else, BEWARE!The End"
1,Spinelli has no taste,"This book, Loser, is AWFUL. Spinelli is almost like one of the other kids in this book, laughing and pointing at him, like he's the main attraction at a freak show. It's so terribly mean, and only shows what's become of our children today. If someone's different, they are automatically labled as weird. It's terrible. And Spinelli brings it out in her book as if it's amusing. It's sick. I'm an avid reader and very accomplished writer, so I know what I'm talking about. I read Stargirl by Spinelli, and hated that book too. I thought I'd give Spinelli a second chance by reading Loser. She doesn't deserve it. Save your money. Buy Harry Potter or the Shadow Children books instead. Spinelli's books are a waste of paper."
3,"Good, Liked ""Stargirl"" More","Jerry Spinelli follows up ""Stargirl"" with a story of another outsider, this time a boy named Donald Zinkoff. He's a vibrant and curious boy and the narrative takes us from first grade up into middle school. I liked this book, and appreciated it's message, but didn't enjoy it as much as ""Stargirl"". This book has a removed third person narrative,like someone's reporting key moments of the boy's life, and it left me not as emotional invested as ""Stargirl"" did. Still, it's a decent book with it's heart in the right place, and a character probably many people can relate to and hopefully learn from."
1,"""Loser"" really is a loser","After reading this book, I vowed never to read another Spinelli book ever again. The flat, identical characters, the flat, simplistic storyline, none of it seemed to have any depth at all. Zinkoff seems to be autistic or challenged to me, yet no information was given on his questionable mental health. Nothing really happened in the book that stood out for me, not much of a climax in the storyline. After such a good book like Stargirl, I'm wondering what in the world Spinelli did to write this one. ""Loser"" tried miserably to inspire me to sympathize with Zinkoff, while all it did was to make me think it was all an obvious pity-party for everyone who's ever felt different. Too many books have been written on this, I feel like I'm drowning in a bowl of chicken soup(books)."
3,Loser,"In my opinion this book was the best ever. I could relate to Donald Zinkoff because he was a genuine person not relying on others validate him. As a teenager we sometimes wait on our friends to make us feel accepted but he didn't. I really enjoyed the book also because it was written about a first grader who goes through some of the same things as a teenager.I compare this book written by Jerry Spenilli to another that I've read, Stargirl. It is about a young lady who too deals with peer pressure but does not surrender to it. I think that Mr. Spenilli writes very well about books dealing with peer pressure because maybe he dealt with it himself. I really enjoyed reading Stargirl.I think that this book definitely should be taught and read in schools because young people deal with a lot of peer pressure. Some good and some bad. This book teaches you to think for yourself, be yourself and make wise choices. I think it should be read by young people of all ages."
5,Loser will be great winner,"Do you have a best friend?Are you always picking on anything fromyour school or your society?Loser is about a boy named Zinkoff.He is like any ordinary kid.He talks, laughs,and has fun.Zinkoff, the main character, has many emotions.Zinkoff has his own world.Zinkoff grew very slowly and difficultly, yet he was very independent from his parents.He did not get any help from his parents, because he took the problems himself.He did not speak to parents.Many people do not recognize themselves in society, because they are too busy at work.They do not have their own character.People just imitate others.While I was reading Loser, I was thinking about my childhood, and I could understand my son, what he thought.I always wanted my son to be perfect.I was not so when I was young.As an adult, I sometimes feel like Loser; like Zinkoff in this society.I believe that this book is for teenagers, but it is also good for adults.Now, I wish that Zinkoff will be great winner."
1,"western chief men's 16"" knee boot",I ordeded this boot in a size 14. the plastic packaging the boots came in stated a size 14 on a sticker and a size 10 printed on the plastic. The attached tag on the boot stated a size 14 but on the bottom of the boot was stamped size 10. Turns out the boots were a size 10 (too small) and had to be returned.
2,Way too big,"I was looking for a cheap pair of waterproof boots that I could wear on a boat. These seemed good; only problem was they were WAY too big. I wear a size 10, ordered a size 10, but they were really more like a size 14. I tried stuffing the toes with cotton, but ended up returning them."
3,Confortables and light,"Compre 2 pares de estas botas y han resultados suaves, ligeras y muy comodas... espero resistan el trabajo, pero por el precio creo que se obtiene value for money.."
1,"Do not rent this-the actual movie is not ""Five Fingers of Death""","DO NOT RENT THIS! THIS IS NOT ""FIVE FINGERS OF DEATH""!The product image is correct and the actual title of the film is ""King Boxer"", which is the U.S. title for ""Five Fingers of Death"", but the actual film is wrong. This is not the Shaw Bros. classic starring Lo Lieh. The actual film you are renting is about Thai Boxing."
2,"Maybe I just don't know what I'm doing, but...","...I have yet to take a non-blurry closeup with these lenses. My closeups were better without this lens. Now, I do have an ""older"" digital camera - a Kodak DC210, but the Kodak web site says these lenses will work with this camera. I'm thinking maybe I'm just too much of a novice, and I'm obviously doing something wrong, but the instruction booklet certainly isn't any help. It's one of those ""general"" instruction booklets that cover multiple products. So, I would say that unless you're really up on use of lenses on digital cameras, pass these up."
3,Not What I am Looking For,"So far, the DVD I am trying to find has not been found. This DVD had lapping waves and some of the sky does not seem to change. Not much bird life or critters in the sand. MY quest is to find large swells, bird life and activity in the sand that shows the place is alive.It is a pretty tropical color but it is not what I am hunting for in a wave DVD. I bought both the Costa Rica DVD's and I would suggest that you get one to see if it is what you want."
1,The plot is a cheat,"There's a malady at the heart of this book. Problem is, the malady as depicted here has little to do with the malady as it exists in real life. Much occurs in the book that could and does not occur when actual humans have this malady.I understand that readers are fascinated by the questions of good, evil, and volition raised by THR3E. For me, the fact that the plot is almost wholly removed from reality renders it irrelevant to genuine questions of good, evil, and volition.Having stuck through almost all the way to the end leaves me feeling cheated. Life's too short to spend on thriller-mysteries that make no sense in the end."
1,Lacking depth,"I have nothing profound to say, just like the book. There are a lot of sections where the author goes into lecture mode rather than focus on story telling. The actual plot is very linear as are the characters. The villain is more like a giant pimple waiting to burst rather than a well played nemesis. Much of the intrigue is lost on events which are really not plausible. The author might have done better to write a stylized story with more blatantly fictional elements rather than try to use every day life as the backdrop. The law enforcement screen play is like watching an old FBI flick from the 70's."
3,Wanted more,"I guessed the twist too early and it ruined the story for me. Also I truly enjoyed the style of writing, I wanted something more. I was a little hungry while reading."
5,Speechless...,"Hands down, this is the best book I have ever read. Out of five stars, this one is a TEN. For once in my life, upon completion of this book, I was completely speechless. I finished the book at my father-in-laws and a friend who had read it asked me what I thought. What could I say other than WOW....?I'm generally not one of those people who watch or read detective stories, just because they tend to be rather predictable. I must say, however that this one was different....I greatly agree with the review below about the book's finale. Dekker seemed to place every likely scenario on the table, yet nothing will prepare you for the conclusion.Hold on, because this one takes you for the ride of your life."
2,Incredibly obvious,"I only made it to the end of this book because I kept thinking that the whole thing was so obvious that there had to be a ""gotcha."" There isn't. You will have it diagnosed by chapter 2. Really disappointing."
4,Unexpected and Chilling Surprises,"A wild ride, with unexpected twists and turns and a stunning ending. Recommend it to anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers."
3,Slow in the beginning,"Outlaw Star, brought her by Bandai Entertainment, contains 9 episodes in this Collection. There are a total of 26 episodes in this series with 3 collections. This collection of 9 episodes seemed to be quite boring. It was basically introducing the characters and what I like to call, 'Filler Episodes.' The characters still continue to be introduced a bit in the second Collection but that is where it starts picking up. The Second Collection has some good episodes setting it up for the end. Better to get the unedited DVD than the ones on Toonami. I prefer the Japanese vocal track over the English Dub in this case. And saying this, I can't wait to get the 3rd Collection. This isn't the best anime or a favorite of mine yet but I'm sure it will prove quite enjoyable."
4,A safe buy for those new to anime,"As most people do, I started my anime career by watching the ever-popular Dragonball Z. After I realized that that show no longer did it for me. I began to search for something with a little more depth and originality. I was lucky enough to come across an anime such as this one.Many people in America may have a problem relating to anime's that have a great deal of japanese culture woven into the story, but I have found that the storyline focuses more on a healthy portion of action, character development, and of course...humor! Don't miss out on this high quality, fast paced anime."
5,Outlaw Star; one of the best Anime's to date.,"This Anime isn't bad, it's good! In fact, it's great. I don't own any of these Anime DVD's, but I'm trying to get enough money to. I've read reveiws and seen the Cartoon Network show (Edited :P), and I'm pretty hyped up about the whole thing.Here's the scoop for those of you who have never heard of this Anime before. This is one of the best Anime's created, number three in my list, and will keep you on the edge of your seat, or whatever your sitting on. The only thing is that I don't like when the ""Next Episode"" things. I know it creates anxiety to see the next episode, but I don't want to know, really.The amount of characters that there are is great. It gives the whole thing a great variety of how people effect each other. The tragedy, nudity(:)), and a great story line.So, if you want a good Anime, get Outlaw Star!"
2,Not one of their better efforts.,"I didn't think this was a very good album, especially for a group with America's reputation and record of success. It was a flop when it was released in the late 70s and failed to produce any big hits. George Martin's production is flawless as usual, but the songs are uneven."
4,beautiful and handy~~~,"Despite the long time it took to be mailed this mouse is really desirable: beautiful color and design, swift response and fine functions. And for a cordless mouse it is quite economical with great quality."
5,Still Ideal!,"I think this mouse is really good, however it has ONE downside so far..Alt & Tab (one of the 2) cannot be manually assigned to it's custom buttons, this might only be important for gamers.As for artists in Photoshop, I was able to figure out how to get the middle button to move the screen.Overall I am still very happy with the mouse I still encourage anyone to buy itThere is an update for the mouses software that would re-allow the alt/tab abilities for the mouse(in its private software custom settings), so still buy it and try it =)Review Updated 2012 - Still no other mouse quite like it. The original one bought lasted me 7 years before its clicking ability died out.Too bad I can't find another one.."
1,NO FRAGRANCE,I EXPECTED THIS PRODUCT TO AT LEAST SMELL HALF AS GOOD AS THE DISCONTINUED AVON PRODUCT. I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT IT HAD NO FRAGRANCE. IT ONLY HAS BODY WASH AND LOTION AND A BUNCH OF USELESS ITEMS. THERE IS NO BODY SPRAY WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE FOR THE PRICE. BUT THAT IS A MOOT POINT SINCE THERE IS NO FRAGRANCE AT ALL!
3,Good enough for government work...,"Soft contrast, specularities on the edges. Great for surveillance bad for prints above 5 x 7."
4,Not bad for under $1000,"I'm sure one of the Canon big lenses would be sharper and faster, but this one isn't a bad lens at all. I will try, but not recommend it, with a 1.4x extender. So far, the 500mm photos do seem a little soft. But if you have your f/7 to 8 in daylight you should be good. No IS? Hey, you'd pay a lot more for that. You are going to use this on a tripod or monopod, so no IS isn't a problem at all."
3,ant,hey anti've got respect for tennessee rap artists but have some respect for the northeast tri state area cuz new york city started this whole rap thing.
5,its great,You need to double check the width that you require before purchasing so you have all the extensions necessary to put the gate up once you have every thing it works well. Very pleased with my purchase
4,Songs that you'll be singing all day!,"We received this as a gift for my three month old son. He loves it! This is the only video that he watches so far. We've tried others and they don't hold his attention. It's fun to see the other babies and toddlers making the signs.It also gives parents many new songs to sing while doing other things (diaper changing time in particular). I'm back at work now and I'm still singing ""The Wheels on the Bus"" song to myself.I only wish that they slowed down the ABC song. It's too hard to learn all the signs at the normal speed of the song."
3,Much better than Vol. 1 - but still not worth the money,"I purchased volumes 1 & 2 in an effort to expand my sons' basic signing knowledge and I'm greatly disappointed! Both boys have loved learning signs from the (Baby Hands productions) ""First Signs"" & ""Sharing Signs"" and also Baby Einstein's ""Around the House."" Comparatively, Signing Smart is truly not worth the investment. The songs, toys & children used in Vol. 2 are a great plus. And in Vol. 2, an adult leads the children in signing to the songs (which helps tremendously). But still, knowing there are better quality productions out there makes Signing Smart hard to stomach."
5,Great DVD. Realistic and Streetwise!,"This DVD is a realistic training lesson on the practicality and use of the KUBOTON. It covers everything from the proper grip to various defense methods and procedures. It is good for anyone from the beginner who knows nothing of this defdense tool, to the experienced practicioner. I highly reccomend it."
2,Not user friendly,"For the price of this DVD, it should not require installation of special programming before a computer will play; for that matter, the bloody thing should play on any device. The info contained is comprehensive, and closely mirrors the information contained in James Gurney's indispensible book, ""Color and Light.""Color and Light: A Guide for the Realist Painter"
4,replacement light cover,It worked fine. although it was alittle under size of the original. A little modtifacation and it worked just fine..
5,Buen cd,Creo q Leonardo muestra realmente su talento con este trabajo y vale muchisimo la pena escucharlo
4,Excellent Program for the Money,"I had been using Adobe Pagemill but didn't want to spend $400 (GoLive) for a new Web design program for OSX. I only need to update and re-design my Web site every now and then, and I am not fluent in html. Freeway 4 Express is great. I tried the free trial of GoLive and was just overwhelmed...Then I tried the free trial of Freeway 4 Express. It didn't take any time at all to get a page designed, and I added a few fun effects that I didn't have with Pagemill. A great buy for the money if you just want to drag and drop and maybe use a little html."
5,Great product,"The pillow is adorable, very soft. The tail of the dolphin makes a handle to carry the pillow around. Would recommend it to everyone."
1,[Bad],...The drummer can barely keep time. There are some nice arrangements but I'd rather hear more competent musicians play them.
3,A DVD that will beloved by all!,The storyline is very very very exciting now! i was so anxious so watch the next DVD ( operation 4). This DVD is a 5 star DVD!
3,It;s all about repeats,"It's all about catching the repeats, think about this for a moment, the numbers repeats all the time in diffrent playdays, but what if you can catch them, all on one line, your lottery ticket. The more you read something the more it comes to light, the instructions on how to, keep reading it, the cent$ of it will come."
2,"Try Ultra Dance 2, it's much better.","I bought this CD based on the fact that I liked Ultra Dance 2. I thought the third one would be another good CD to listen to for the summer. I was disappointed when I got my CDs and listened to them. The mixes on these songs are terrible, with the exception of two tracks. On the other hand, Ultra Dance 2, which is mixed by DJ Encore, is much better in comparison. Although the songs on Ultra Dance 2 are last year songs, it is worth more than this one. Trust me, you are not missing anything."
4,Love these shoes,I like these shoes a lot they run a little small but are really cute and comfortable.
4,Great cartridge,I haven't had a chance to use this cartridge yet but have lots of ideas on what to do with it.
2,The only reasons to buy it are for a complete Myst collection and for the Mac-Only Easter Egg,"This game is the worst version of Myst. The original is classic and realMyst is my personal favorite version. The only reason to buy Masterpiece is for the Mac-only easter egg. Basically, set the book room lock in Mechanical to all ""C"" symbols and click the lower right bolt of the panel. You're taken to a website w/ a beta vid of Uru/Mudpie. And no, there are no You Tube vids of it and the link isn't on the Myst wiki 'cause Cyan said not to publish it. So, this game is basically a $16-$170 easter egg. Which is wrong. Cyan, just release the link so Masterpiece can die in peace. There's my 2 cents about this version. Myst deserves 5/5, but this expensive easter egg is worthless."
4,Region 2,Loved Series 1 but unfortunately i do not have a special DVD player for Region 2. Wish this and other series could be made available for play inUSA. thanks.
1,Save Your Money!,"This book is a total waste of money. Also, the author profile on Robert Sjoquist are exaggerations. This man has not started seven companies! I worked for him for two years and he is dishonest, has been married three times, and has been sued numerous times by his employees. He has also been sued by his customers. Not fit to give business advice."
2,Good Toy but not safe to chew on,"Got these for a 1st birthday gift and she loves them. BUT, she loves to chew on them and they are made in China. I have read several places that the paint comes off. As they have no indication of ""non-toxic"" on them, they are not regulated for chewing on. That means they are most likely unsafe, as are most toys from China that don't say ""non-toxic"".On a side not, I wonder how something gains the label ""non-toxic""? How are the rules determined and enforced? I don't really trust anything that doesn't specifically say it is ok to chew on.If your child is older and can be trusted to keep them out of their mouth, and not drink out of them in the tub, they should be a good toy for the bath. Very cute."
2,BEWARE!!! Harbor mold and fungus,"My daughter received these as a gift. They are adorable and the right size for her tiny hands. HOWEVER, I soon realized they were a danger! I kept seeing little black particles in her bathwater, specifically after we squirt the toys. I soon realized it was the toy. I was confused as I squeeze the water out after each use. I cut one open and YUCK it was filled with mold. I did a quick internet search and realized this is a common problem, specifically with this brand. Be very careful. Cute toy if not used in the water."
3,Cute toys!,"These are very cute, but they are a lot smaller than I had expected. Makes a good baby shower present."
3,good for the price,"My daughter who is 11 months enjoys playing with these. However, the paint has already started peeling off of the turtle and we've only used these in the bath less than 10 times before it started peeling. Even though it says it's non-toxic, the set is essentially down to 7 pieces since I won't let her play with the turtle any more. The carrying case is convenient for storage between uses."
5,Anime to Video Game at it's best,"Just got to play this game yesterday. (Yeah. I bought it for a while, but my 360 had the 3 red light hardware failure. Microsoft was great at getting it fixed. Not mad at Microsoft. Only inconvenience was not being able to play 360 games for a 3 weeks).These are my first impressions of the game.Very interesting and dynamic. Story line follows the anime VERY well. I'm happy with the graphics during gameplay, but the video clips are pretty low res. Only got to some of the mini games. Not very challenging yet and slightly boring start. But I expect it to get much better as the story progresses. Controls are great. Love being able to go through the Leaf Village. It's like RPG meets fighting.Highly recommend this game."
2,Not much help,"This book is cute, but not much help for little ones to ease their move. It does show that all the boxes get packed and go to a new house which will be better. But it doesn't say that it will be better for the kids, just for the parents."
1,Worst wrestling biography I ever read...oooooh yeah!,"As an avid wrestling fan for many years...I had been searching for a biography written by/about Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage. When I found this book written by Jacqueline Mudge, I thought I would be getting an inside look into the history of Randy Poffo's growing up, and a trueful look into his life in the world of professional wrestling. NOT THE CASE!! Although there was maybe a page and a half that was dedicated to his growing up, and dreams of being a professional baseball player. The rest of the book merely chronicals his professional career through the eyes of the story-lines...not the behind the scenes look I was hoping for. There wasn't anything in this book that I didn't already know, and couldn't be found from watching the Wrestlemania's that he was involved in. I gave this book one star, and can't tell you how disappointing a read this was."
1,Sand In The Wind,I wanted a new hardbound copy of this book and was surprised to receive a used copy for $70+ I would have preferred a new soft cover copy at a much lower price. Thanks for your time.Kevin Creahan
3,An OK Friday night distraction,"Made for TV and inspired by a true story, Flood takes us to a small town down the Mississippi awaiting disastrous high waters coming from upstream. Not too far fetched considering what happened in Iowa last summer (2008). The script is good, and the execution OK. The main drama, of two kids gone to fetch grandpa from the impending danger and getting stuck right in it, reminded me a lot of Dante's Peak. I was a bit disappointed by the lack of flood damage shown, and the evident amateurism of the levee set. They kept telling us of towns upstream being flooded, but never showed any. CNN's footage of Iowa was much scarier! But overall it's enjoyable."
3,There is a learning curve,"Like others have said, this mirror is designed for the driver's side. Placing one on the passenger side mirror is completely useless.On the driver side, the convex mirror significantly distorts the distance of cars. Cars in the next lane 2 or 3 car lengths away appear as a dot barely noticeable in the mirror. Cars next or in your blind spot is fairly noticeable. Users just have to get use to where cars are in the mirror related to your own car."
2,"Great idea, needs work.","I though the shape and design were going to be winners, but the inside edge is over 1/2"" thick.Should taper from 1/8"", etc.Mounted them and the 1/2"" + height is too much. Way too thick.Tossed these and got thin stick on mirrors."
1,crap,"hated it, not better that the Remo Palam patches, dont buy this bc they will fall off over time, and its not as durable."
3,It helps,I found this book to be quite useful as long as it is used in conjunction with other sources for preparation.To insure you are fully coverd for the test you will need to go more in depth into the things discussed in this book.Overall this book is a big help.
1,Great start goes down hill fast!,"As a sufferer of this dreadful disease myself, I was eager to read a book about Carcinoid Syndrome. And I guess that's the problem. The beginning chapters-maybe four or five- are about the illness, then this book disintegrates into a story that has nothing to do with an illness of any kind. It's about a bloody ski trip money fiasco! Christ! Who cares? I'm sorry. Write another book called "" Who took the Ski Money"" or something. Where were the editors?! Don't sell a book to people dying to find out more about a miserable debilitating cancer and then switch to a personal legal battle that has nothing to do with it what so ever. I just don't get it. And wish I hadn't gotten it-this book, that is. Don't waste your money."
5,Definitely a Classic! a must read!!!,"Our Hero Deleuze is back at it once again on his Bergsonian quest to conquer the movement-image.This time descending light from the plane of immanence will guide our hero through phenomenological blunders. Wow! what an amazing book! Deleuze has done it again, I mean talk about the varities! Perception-Image, Affect Image and Action Image. It totally clairfies any misconsceptions about the liquid, gasous and solid states. If there is such thing as a rhizomatic world, could the Time-Image be a prequel? Deleuze is smoking!!!!"
1,Product not as described,"I really liked this nice set of glasses. Looked like a great deal for box of 12. I ordered 1 set and got only 1 single glass. I wrote to seller many times and got no response back. I am still hoping to get remaining 11 glasses, but it doesn't look so promising. I noticed I am not the only one with the same problem. Now I am stuck with 1 single glass that is overpriced. I am not happy about that."
3,Teddy does Country,"I enjoyed the first two Teddy Thompson albums very much, and was very impressed with his vocals. He was the sort of soothing, melodic voice that wraps itself around every song he attempts. As you can tell from the reviews, this album was a slight departure for Teddy, where he covers a bunch of classic country tunes. It's all very well done, and Teddy has chosen material that suits his voice, but there's a same-iness to it all, creating a very mellow mood with not many sonic peaks and valleys. As another reviewer noted, nearly every song on here was performed better by the original artist. It's not like Teddy is doing a bad job of covering these tunes. Not at all. But he hasn't really added anything to the compositions, nor made me want to go back and discover any of the original artists. A good, solid album, but far from spectacular."
5,Great fun!,I am an intermediate level player and bought this to use on the new MacBook Air with OSX10.5.2. I was pleasantly surprised with the fast loading speed for the game and the ease of use. The board letters are big and bright enough and you can see the countdown for the number of tiles left. No unexpected program quits. Extras like Scrabble dictionary and hints make this a great way to upgrade your skills.
2,It cheats!,"This game is well done, fun, and addictive, BUT it cheats. There are a small number of words in its dictionary that do not appear in the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary (4th edition). It beat me tonight (barely) by using GADJO. If you look this up in the OSPD4, it isn't there. If you look it up in its own online version, it's there, but with ""Definition not available"". If you look it up in Google, it's a Barcelona-based gypsy-ska group, which gets its name from the Roma word for non-Romanji people. (That's the sort of obscure word that Scrabble lives by, but to use such a word when it is NOT in the OSPD is just cheating!) This is the second or third time in a year or so that I have encountered one of these. Grrrr...."
2,Too many unusual words,this Scrabble accepts a number of non English words that seem to me totally unnecessary...Why not stick to english??Thank you
4,On the hands,Slim enough to cover my hands and yet thin enough to grip the wheel. Need to get a summer weight....
2,The Funeral DVD,"The Funeral is a good movie, as I had seen it before; however, the DVD is of poor quality and therefore I didn't watch it. I wish Amazon would provide information on the DVD label, so we would know what company has produced the DVD."
2,Yawn. . .bury it!,"I was really disappointed in this movie, ESPECIALLY since I love Christopher Walken Chris Penn, and Benicio Del Toro-- all the makings for a great movie, but I couldn't stay with it, either I would lose interest, or fall asleep. Sorry to say this just didn't do it for me. I guess I expected more action, plot, something. . . it was just lacking."
1,Critic,This is a rather boring and uninteresting book. Contrary to its publisher's description it is not full of anecdotal or interesting background information. I wish I hadn't bought it. I might sell it back.
4,Lighting DVD,"I rated this high because I thought it provided a great overall look at the hardware available for the studio and provided a light technical overview. I have looked at other programs, such as the Dean Collins series, which was highly technical but didn't offer information about hardware availability. Hope this helps you."
2,I liked the print,"What I can say? The best thing in the book was the fine print. If you don't buy books to read, but because the print... you have a nice opportunity"
5,First exposure to test driven development,"I attended a workshop on test driven development presented by James Newkirk. I was so intrigued with the concept that I had to go out and get his book to find out more. As a result our project now uses NUnit, TestDriven.net for test driven development and find that this has really boosted confidence in the developers and their code. The concept of test-driven development is a very useful agile method of writing code to the requirements based on tests (Red/Green/Refactor). This has certainly changed my perspective towards development and want to thank James Newkirk for purveying this concept."
3,Get the Complete Miniseries instead!,"Having watched and thoroughly enjoyed the entire miniseries on TV in the 1980s, I bought this set and expected it to be the same. I was very disappointed with the editing done to reduce the length from 8 hours down to 5 hours. The result is choppy, with dialogue frequently referring to scenes and sequences that were cut. In addition, there are editorial gaffes in some of the recaps of previous episodes where the cut scenes are recapped. These instances left me wondering what I had missed -- and then I realized that the scenes had been cut out. While this cut is still riveting, if you're willing to sit still for 5 hours of this version of Shaka Zulu, I'd recommend spending the additional 3 hours watching the complete version -- and at about the same price. It's well worth it!"
5,Great little spice rack,"I got this spice rack for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it because is doesn't take up a lot of room, the jars are glass and it looks great. It was packed well and arrived in perfect shape."
5,Perfect!,"I love this spice rack! It's sturdy, functions well and looks wonderful. The spices I have used were all fresh. I did a LOT of research before buying this product, and this one lives up to it's reviews. No more shuffling through my cabinets in search of a certain spice, everything is at my fingertips. Even my husband loves this spice rack! As far as price, Amazon offered the lowest on this item. Definitely a great deal!"
1,Terrible lids,"If I could give it 0 stars, I would. All the lids on all the jars don't snap shut. My spices are all pale/old/dried out. Terrible."
3,Great spice rack!,"I looked at multiple spice racks and was glad to find this rotating one. It looks good on my counter and is easy to use. The best part is the containers where already filled.Thanks,Juju"
2,Can't fit teaspoons in the jars,"I bought this spice rack because it looked nice and organized, but I hate that I can't fit my teaspoons in them for recipes. Also the names of the spices starting coming off in the 1st month of use. I still prefer my store-bought spices."
4,Spice rack,This spice rack is very attractive. Takes up a fair amount of space. Does not have names of spices in very 'easy to read' places. The delivery time was better than expected. Well packed. Would buy anoher one if needed.
5,Love my Jar Orbit Spice Rack,I love my Jar Orbit Spice Rack. The stand is very convenient. The 2 sided lids are great. The locking inner lid is a great idea for the spices I don't use very often. I would like to have another tier of empty jars for my own spices.
4,Brilliant Look at Sordid Chapter in Film History,"This is a beautifully written, brutally honest, well-researched, wholly unsentimental, and non-judgemental portrait of low-budget sexploitation filmmaker Andy Milligan. While some of the violence and depravity displayed by Milligan and his players is portrayed in such graphic detail as to occasionally make the reader feel thoroughly soiled, McDonough's book is like a particularly devastating car wreck-it's a horrifying spectacle from which it's impossible to turn away. After having read this, I have no desire to see a single scene from an Andy Milligan movie, but found this book to be an incredibly rewarding look at the seamy underbelly of low-budget American cinema, as well as the fascinating putative beginnings of New York's off-Broadway theater.McDonough does a remarkable job chronicling the offbeat, the eccentric, the forgotten, and I'm now especially eager to read the author's long-time-forthcoming biography of Neil Young."
2,Wrestling with the Godhead,"W. Somerset Maugham wrote, ""A good rule for writers: do not explain overmuch."" Unfortunately, this is exactly what Boyd does. His lack of clear organization, both in text and documentation of source materials, makes for inconvenient, tedious reading. Oneness Pentecostal doctrine is simplistic. Even when contrasting ""Oneness Pentecostals & the Trinity"", a well-written text could cover the subject in half the space. This book is wordy, repetitive, and contains too much of Boyd's personal angst to be objective. A broader, deeper, better-written book on the subject of Oneness Pentecostalism (including the Oneness/Trinity controversy) is Thomas A. Fudge's ""Christianity without the Cross: A History of Salvation in Oneness Pentecostalism"".Christianity Without the Cross: A History of Salvation in Oneness Pentecostalism"
4,Anais is always searching,"This book has so much wisdom. I find myself reading it very slowly to stop and really think about what she has to say. This volume of her diary is more disconnected than the one prior, but the insight is much more profound."
4,The best literary diary ever,Anais Nin's Diary is the best diary I have ever read. It is so detailed like capturing her thought patterns so intricately that one is amazed at her depth of character. She is quite honest in her relationships to June and Henry Miller.You are going to love it if you love reading personal accounts or diaries. This one takes it to another level.
3,in spanish,"el sonido muy bueno, pero en el playlist hicieron mucha falta canciones q si estan en el helalive"
3,Great protection but little extra room,Case fits camera well but there is little extra room except for perhaps an extra tape. It would be nice if there was room for the AC adapter & cables.
3,good book but too big and bulky,"This is a very thorough book, but i wanted something that would be convenient to carry with me so I could use it wherever I needed it. This book is great for at home use but too large to carry in a purse or by hand."
3,if you like knock-outs this is for you....,what i dont like about this dvd is that it is mainly knock-outs which isnt that important to me...i was hoping for more of the best matches in the ufc... they didnt even have the ken shamrock vs. gracie fight and alot of the time i would rather see the whole match not just the last 2 minute of the fight where some 1 would get knocked out or submitted in... it gets boring real quickoverall its an average dvd not great more of a rental to me...
1,"Not so good, had small hole in front, loose thread hanging out, rough edges, not finished looking.","Bought ""Batman"" costume whished it was better quality. Had small hole in front, wasn't cheap, so not happy with that. Can't return it 'cause my son loves it, gift from'Santa'. Unfinished hems & hanging threads. Wouldn't recommend a coustume from this sight again."
3,This book is mediocre.,"It would help a lot if a color matching guide (palette) was included in the book. There are a variety of color interpretations made by clothing manufacturers, it is at times difficult to find the exact color match the author is suggesting."
3,Crystal Children,"The book was fine and I even started noticing more children that seemed to fit the description of Crystal Children around me. Then I realized that maybe I was reading too much into this and will have to hold my judgement, since most of the information was coming from parents about their children and I held and propogated similiar views about my children, who are now grown. Don't we all do this in one way or another? And isn't our society geared to stifle, drug and destroy all our wonderful children? One good thing about this book is maybe more parents will recognize all children as gifted and not be so quick to write any of them off. And maybe more of these angels among us will be protected and recognized. Maybe we grown ups will pay attention too. I recommend the book as it has prompted me to investigate this further."
5,EYE OPENING,IF YOU ARE AN INDIGO/CHRYSTAL/RAINBOW THIS BOOK WILL EXPLAIN YOU WHY YOU ARE THE WAY YOU ARE. IT MAKES IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND YOURSELF. IT WILL TAKE YOUR SPIRITUAL UNDERSTANDING TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL. NICE BOOK.
1,"Whittle away, old timer","This obviously archaic version of what Dr. Rosenfeld considers a timely view of alternative medicine does nothing more than demonstrate his age and misconceptions about contemporary healthcare.Particularly in his views on chiropractic in the chapter ""A Disjointed Theory?"", Rosenfeld says chiropractors are excellent for low backs but believes they should never touch necks. How disjointed is HIS theory? Is the spine in the neck all that much more delicate or different from that of the lower back? I myself have had problems in the past in both regions and have found chiropractic to be my only true source of relief and correction of the true source of my problem.The only thing Dr. Rosenfeld sheds light on in this book is his medical bias, age-old theories, and misguided hypotheses. And all without merit. ""The truest sign of ignorance is to dispell something you know nothing about."""
2,Reebok Heart Monitor,"The Reebok Heart Monitor arrived without a working battery. Dead as a doornail. I contacted the Reebok people, as instructed in the material. The cost of shipping it to them plus the time lost without the product made it more sensible to purchase a battery locally. Although I purchased a better battery than would have been installed originally, it cost me an extra $25 that should not have been necessary."
4,"This book was well-written, and the content was excellent.","The way that this book was fitted together was really excellent, although it was a bit monotonous concerning the ignorance of the people involved. I liked this book because it was a real page turner, and you never knew what was going to happen next."
2,THE HEROINE IS AN UGLY DUCK!!!!!!,"I did not really like this book,Seona was not very pretty and I think it kinda ruined the book for me. But if you don't mind that then you should read this book."
5,70'S,SAW THE MOVIE ON TV AND WITHIN MINUTES ORDERED THE DVD. GOTTA LOVE THE 70'S. THOSE WERE THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES.
4,Great for the price,"This dartboard isn't the most high end item I've ever purchased, but its certainly a great deal and will do the the trick. Easy to hang and packaged well. I saw some reviews that were not as positive, but for the price, you can't find anythng out there as nice, unless you're willing to pay substantially more money."
2,Busted,"Mine arrived in the original shipping container packaging with a packing slip affixed to the outside of the box. While this thin-skinned packaging kept it safe in the container on the way across the Pacific, I do not think it was intended to serve as a shipping container in it's own right. My dartboard cabinet arrived severely damaged.The right cabinet door was completely broken off at the hinges while the top hinge took some of the cabinet with it. The brass screws that had held the cabinet door on were loose in the box and during shipping one came to rest on the dartboard surface and damaged it by permanently indenting the board with a screw profile.The supplied darts are a step above disposable bar darts although the flights (stars and bars along with the union jack) are very nice quality and look good on my Nodors.I contacted Harvil and they are having me work through Amazon to get the item replaced."
2,"""Bad Attitude"" left me with an attitude","I write this as I got this book by misteak*. (purposely misspelled) I thought this was an actual experience book, It wasn't and it was my fault for not being more selective. It was well written, but the action in the book was mainly of a ompany political nature with minimal action. I have experienced some of the things described in this bnook and it briught back rather unpleasant memories of my service days as well as my real life work in ""the World"". I guess I could say that it was a reminder to me to look before I leap."
2,A Real Disappointment,"I got this book hoping for somthing akin to Caro's biographies of Moses and LBJ, and was very disappointed. The authors are more concerned with segregated housing in Chicago, and the civil rights movement - they appear to make no effort to understand or explain Daley the person or what made him tick. Just page after boring page on the unfairness of segregated housing and how racist Daley was. This could use some ""truth in packaging"" - I would not have bought and read a book on the struggle for ""fair housing"" and civil rights in Chicago, and it needs a label ""WARNING - Authors despise Irish Catholics and smugly look down on them"". I agree that, while Royko's bio of Daley is not the efinitive one, it is at least readable and entertaining compared to this diatribe."
2,Errors Abound,"If you're looking for a basic primer on Richard J. Daley, then this book is a harmless introduction. Serious historians will find the many inaccuracies in this book appalling though. On a first skimming, I found two mistakes, and I'm just a little above the average citizen in my knowledge of the city. It's rather scary that the two authors are national journalists, given the sloppy treatment of the facts here."
2,An Oversimplified View Of A Very Complex Man,"While authors Cohen and Taylor ceaselessly document Daley's racism and political power, they explain almost nothing about his family or his true feelings. It is a very shallow, one-sided portrait of someone who was anything but simple. Daley ran the city of Chicago extremely well for many years, but most of the book deals with housing and racism. As a longtime Chicagoan, I was very disappointed with this book. I wanted to know what made Daley tick; this book did not tell me. There was nothing in this book that I couldn't have learned from other sources."

5,This is a great battery,"I bought this battery to replace the crappy battery that comes stock on my '08 BWM R1200GS motorcycle. And fortunately for me I replaced it just before a huge cold snap gripped Texas for more than a week (temps were hovering around 15F the whole week). Even though I let the bike sit in the parking lot for a week due to icy roads, when I finally got around to starting it in very cold weather it cranked without any hesitation. I know for a fact my original battery wouldn't even have clicked. I am one happy customer."
5,Don't buy another type of battery...,I am purchasing this Odessey PC535 to replace the one I currently have on my HD XLH1200 sportster. The battery lasted me 13 years! I'll never buy another brand/type again.
2,unbelievable plot,"I love that this book is set in San Francisco. And the story about her having a 'pretend' life to escape her fame as a rich society girl is interesting. Hardly anyone could resist reading about the lifestyle of the rich and famous, and this book does that.The plot is just way too unbelievable. How could Kezia have escaped the notice of paparazzi? How could the other people she hung out with not recognize her? Spoilers ahead: Worst, how could she, with all of her money and power, not hire an amazing lawyer for her boyfriend? That was stupid. And then her falling for the other guy is just way unbelievable."
4,Another great book by Danielle Steel,Passions Promise.I bought this book because the one had was pretty ragged and I lost a couple of the pages
5,Passions promise,As usual Danielle Steele has again written a wonderful book with interesting characters and a good story line It arrived in good condition and on time
2,Best of inane Jay Jay videos (and that's not saying much).,"I got several Jay Jay videos from the library where I work, expecting a cute show for my kids. Instead, I found that they are all pretty stupid! Some of the episodes try to teach a good lesson, but the plotlines are misguided and lame."
3,Installation a pain,"The drive performs as expected given that it uses an IDE interface (reasonably quick and very quiet). I installed this as a back-up device in an older Dell running XP Pro. The instructions in the box were poorly written and incomplete. I had to go online to get the needed info which was OK since I have multiple computers, but if you are replacing the boot drive on your only computer, well you want to do your research in advance."
3,It's ok but not what I order,"This item shows 500 GB of hard drive storage. But when I received it and install it in my pc, and I check my hard drive properties, it only shows 125 GB hard drive storage. I bought it brand new for $64.00."
5,Original arrangements of great songs,"The video showcases a new spin on some established great songs. The arrangements are unique and the performance is top-notch. The arrangement on The Luckiest is amazing and Ben shares his thoughts between songs. If you are new to the group or a long time fan, you will enjoy the original arrangements on these songs."
2,wordy,"I bought the book for 3 reasons:- C# (I was a VB.NET developer)- eXtreme programming- Unit TestingOnly Unit Testing did fulfill my expectations.The book itself doesn't read easy. It contains a lot of text without telling much. I think the book could be reduced to 250 pages without loosing the strength of it.The references in the book and some chapters were interesting.They inspired me to test some new ideas.The author knows his profession without any doubt, but I didn't get used to the way he wrote this book."
1,"what, no editors?","I like Ron's writing style, but the code samples in the book bore only superficial relationship to the text. I expected to be able to sit down with this book and follow along, but I could not because the disconnect between code and text was so great that I couldn't bear to read any further. The book sits, unfinished by me, which is fitting since it was left unfinished by Ron and the publisher."
5,adorable snail,"Ordered one for a friend's baby's first birthday; it was so nice I ordered one for our one-year-old, too. I had seen one in the infant room at a Montessori school before he was born and loved it. Great toy, very cool motion. Baby likes it too."
1,O'My Ouch!!!,"I was very hopeful about this product so when I received it in the mail my husband and I wanted to try it immediately. Unfortunately instead of the pleasing tingling sensation promised all I felt was an intense burning. Needless to say, it is not something I would try again or recommend to anybody."
5,RV rear view mirror,I have a 1993 Chevy Van 3500 Chassis. This was almost the same as factory original. Stainless steel outer body should remain maintnenace free for a long time. Bolted right on. Doesn't vibrate like the old one. Can't go wrong here.
2,Big Dissapointment,"I expected a wonderful resource of Christmas tunes and their history, what I got was a misirable book with very little information, some of it completly wrong. It excludes many of the tunes because of copyright--for the price, they could have gotten permission--it is very easy to do--simply call the owner or write them a letter--most of the time there is no charge."
1,DON' T BUY THIS,"I purchased this product however the CD's don't contain the millions of images, fonts, clip art etc. You get a couple of CD's with some fairly useless images and an activiation code entitling one years access to their download website. After the year they expect that you will pay for a subscription at crazy prices!! Unless this is what you want don't bother with this item.Mine is going back since this is not what they represent on the box. (they designed a good package/box but the contents are nothing like what the box shows)."
1,Pales in comparison to volume 1,"There are far fewer matches than volume one, and some fights seemed to be thrown in as an afterthought. My opinion is that this was rushed to production. Hands down I would recommend volume 1 over volume 2.Special features on the DVD are minimal, but do include an interview with Bas Rutten."
3,Not much there,"The cover is better than the book. The cover and title has one think this book is about St. Joseph, not about the author. My mistake and my waste of money."
1,One Sided,The tape I received had only one side.I was disappointed and returned it which Amazon credited money back to my account.Amazon is great for backing the products sold on their site.I will try Home Depot next.
1,lousy,"Used this for area rugs on hardwood floors--didn't hold the rugs, but, in removal took the floor coating with it. This was in every case, so now I have refinishing to do. Beware of this product!"
1,Doesn't work well for me,I bought this tape to hold down some oriental rugs that are on top of low-pile carpet. It's not holding the rug down and starting to buckle again in several places. Not recommended for this use.
3,"basically acceptable, but....","The problem is this tape is way too thin to effectively ""grab"" the underside of the carpet. I find some of the stair treads I used it for keep shifting position because the tape lies so flat. It should be thicker so the adhesive surface is pressed against the carpet backing."
5,Cool collection,I thought they were all preaty funny. I recomend this to anyone who wants to laugh and chill. Half baked is my favorite.
1,"awkward, and not in a fun way.","Not funny. Felt immature, not in a way that might be seen as humorous, but immature as though it were a film school project made by film students who thought they were funnier than they are. Also, the kid actors seemed awkward (and not haha awkward, but out-of-place awkward) - overall it's just plain not worth wasting your time on. I'm sorry..."
2,CHEAP Built,the shoes were great for about 10 days than started falling apart.They still look good on the outside but not holding together on the inside. I'm not fat nor do I have swety feet
4,Best Yet!!!!,"I have to say, this cd is the best cd that he has done. At first I was like here we go again with the one hit cd's(PLEASE DON'T GO), but after listening too it a couple of times it is DA BOMB. I have been listening to this cd everyday all day ever since. I really love the tracks WHO DAT & WEDDING SONG. I would recommend this cd to all."
4,TANK*** SEX LOVE AND PAIN,"I LOVE THIS CD IT IS BETTER BY FAR THAN HIS LAST TWO CDS. THE TITLE SONG SEX, LOVE AND PAIN IS THE BOMB, THEN THERE IS HEARTBREAK, PLEASE DON'T GO, WHEN, AND BODY. THE REST OF THE CD IS THE BOMB AS WELL IT IS A GREAT LISTEN WHEN DRIVING OR AT HOME WITH YOUR MAN, TANK DID THE JOB ON THIS CD"
4,Show him some respect!,"Tank does not get the respect he deserves. This guy continually puts out great albums. You can tell that he takes his time. Why is it that 40-year old men like R. Kelly put out songs like ""I'm a Flirt"" and sales go through the roof but someone putting out genuine R&B can't even get a decent record deal. Tank is signed to blackground records. This album is quickly becoming a classic. I'm not saying that he should be up there with Luther, but he's definately better than all the Trey Songz and Ne-Yos of the world."
5,A truly unique workout.,"I have been buying workout videos for many, many years and I can say that this is one of the most unique and CHALLENGING series of workout DVDs (also purchased the Core Body and Lower Body workout). Don't let the word ""ballet"" trick you into thinking that this is going to be easy. This is a HARD workout!!!! And I LOVE IT! Leah moves slowly enough through the moves to let you really tune in to how it is supposed to feel, but doesn't stay on any one move so long that you pass muscle failure. I would HIGHLY recommend her videos!"
3,Don't expect it to last,This metronome is not built to last. I have used mine every day for four years and the buttons no longer register presses. The Tama Rhythm Watch and the Boss DB-90 are pricier because they are designed better. They use knobs and switches instead of cheap rubber buttons.
5,apc liscious,"Its funny their are a few people who have written a recomendation for the second instalment of the sceries and also diddnt notice that amazon has the vol 1 and 2s songs backwards it you really want to know what the actual names for these song are check out vol 2. This is an excellent disk from laswell and the apc group. nicky skepelotis dxt exc... A very hard dist to fund do to its french pressing, its on the actual apc label and is still in print from them directelly through nyc at WWW.apc.fr if you get one dont be scared the cd looks burnt and their is just a picture of a drum set and the song titles on the back thats the only way it came. Hip hop dub fushion liscious enjoy."
3,Great!! but...,"I have a few gripes w/ this book. First of all, Narm is one of the most annoying character ever. Couldn't he have been, just slightly less... whiny, whimpering and wussy? ^_~ Seriously, it's not too bad. I love the Hidden House, and how the characters interact. I just think the little morale Shandril yells at the lich and Narm's weakling attitude were too much. Aside from that, I really enjoyed it. It's even more action-packed than the first one."
3,got it to run on my mac,"Great service from amazon, as usual. I bought this to run on my mac as a virtual machine. Its windows and I'm glad its not Vista."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"THIS PRODUCT WAS TO BE SOLD WITH A NEW COMPUTER, NOT INDIVIDUALLY. IT IS A ONE TIME USE ONLY SO MY RATING IS AS LOW AS IT CAN BE I WOULD NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR AGAIN."
4,Solid.,"I've owned XP for a couple of years, and its a great system. It doesnt crash, its easy to use, and its customization is much better then Vista and Mac OSX (but not better then Linux.) Its the most professional, its used by business people. Its also great to have if your a bit geekier. You can change the themes. Code and game if you want. Its just more flexible (Mac OSX/Vista isn't.)Right now I'm running Vista (I hate it, and so do all my freinds) and on another computer (a shiny new Imac) I have apple. It comes down to this:XP > Mac OSX > Vista. And Linux goes somewhere in there depending on who you are.Overall XP is the best. There are a few exceptions, like being dumb/effortless, or being a professional photographer/video maker, but XP is better for normal stuff. And no one, and I mean NO ONE, should use vista."
4,Suited my needs,"This product is fine and suited my needs. I did have a couple problems installing it at first (because it was not listed as OEM software on the website, so I wasn't expecting this) but I worked it out. I used this product to install on my Mac to run windows-based programs. Everything is ok now."
4,XP vs. Vista,"I like XP. Why go Vista? Why do they keep upgrading the product so often? I know it's all about money, but if there are no significant improvements, they don't need to distribute new product. Plus, I can't play my old WIN 95 games/programs. Why don't they issue a fix for that? I won't upgrade until they stop supporting XP or not even that if I don't have to."
4,windows xp for apple notebook,"I recently bought the full version windows xp with sp2 for my mac notebook due to the fact that many of the programs I needed do not have mac versions. I found the installation with Bootcamp(already equip with new apple notebooks) and absolutely seemless transition. I split my hard drive between mac and windows xp(I did not go with parallels) and have found no issues as yet except my computer once stopped in the middle of an application and just rebooted itself and it hasn't happened again. When my desk top is ready to replaced, I will use the windows xp version again on the apple desk top that I plan to purchase. Great buy....Also very easy to uninstall off apple notebook and start over... We all know how windows gets jammed up after a while and regardless of all the disk cleanups and defrags etc it starts to run slow and needs to be redone."
1,"Buy a Mac, save your sanity!","I used to ow a PC...I work with PCs all day at work. I've used every version of this lousy OS that's been released, up to and including, Windoze XPNow, I come home to my Mac (2nd one I have personally owned) and know what a REAL OS is supposed to be.Unless you have specific programs that don't have Mac compatible versions, you really have no reason to buy a PC. Seriously. Why anyone would, with all the porly built versions of Windoze, is beyond me.Anyway, if you REALLY must have Windoze...you can put it on a Mac now. You will have the ability to shut the damn thing off and move on over the wonderfully put together OS X when you don't want to deal with it anymore.Please people, get a Mac and teach Bill Gates to either make a good product or don't bother.All I have to say is that with a Mac, you can forget about CTRL ALT DELETE!"
1,hated it!,"My computer was so slow and buggy with this software it was pathetic, I recommendUbuntu 7.04 PC Edition"
1,It's just windows,"Delivery and service from Amazon was fine, as usual.The product is Winows, so it is buggy, flaky and horrible, as expected. Too bad I had to buy it!"
3,It's Windows....how many stars could it possibly get?,"I bought this to run on my macbook pro. It works fine with the new version of parallels which is a big improvement over the previous version. In retrospect, given the cost, I'd probably have been better off getting an Acer or HP netbook for $20-$40 more. I really just needed it to run a few programs, both of which would run fine on a netbook and then I'd have had a whole other computer! This version really should be $100.The installation and updating process for windows still amazes me for the number of steps required."
1,"Hi, I'm a Mac",I do not like windows in anyway. I was forced to by it to run a program on my Mac (which I LOVE) using Parallels. I cringe every time I have to open it.
3,It isn't too bad,"I've seen the ""Larry The Cable Guy"" movies and like a previous reviewer said, each one is getting better. I rented ""Witless Protection"" and found it quite amusing. Sure it has some hard to believe situations and outcomes, but, hey, so does the ""Indiana Jones"" series."
1,Larry should have remained a cable guy,"This man is why terrorists hate us. He makes our entire nation look stupid and uneducated. I think that it is sad and insulting that someone so completely talentless can become such a success in the entertainment industry, and also a sad statement about the mentality of society."
5,Awesome product,"Fits my thick laptop with a 15.4"" screen perfectly. Even has a little pouch for the power brick. The neoprene is so stretchy that even the brick fits. Perfect for those who dont want to lug around a heavy laptop case."
4,GOOD SUBJECT,"I enjoyed the play, young people really need to watch this, to know what marriage is about."
4,Good play,I like plays & this one was real good....it was real & it had a good message. The actors were great & it was believable.
3,Possible Movie in the future,I think that this play is going to be perry's next movie. I dont know if its in the making yet though.
3,Stains everything in sight,"This lube is great at what it does. It goes on light, cleans your chain and provides silky smooth chain movement. But it is dyed red and the dye tends to stick on everything including the hard to reach areas in the interior of the cassette. It also seemed to permanently stain my plastic chainstay guard. Now instead of being clear, it's pink (stained red against a white paint job). I understand that the dye helps you distinguish between the products, but this seems to be a case of aesthetics getting in the way of function. I chucked the bottle in the trash after only using about half of it."
5,The Rescue-The Best In The Willy Trilogy,"This movie is great, despite what you may be thinking. More realistic that Free Willy 1 and 2, it's plot is seamless and easy to believe. Jesse (Jason James Richter) interns with Randolph (Schellenburg, the Native American guy) as a research assistant. They find Willy with Jesse's harmonica call played 24 hours a day throughout the Canadian sea. They encounter a whaling boat, but the captain's son, ten year old Max, is silently opposed to whaling. Max and Jesse work together to try and stop the whaling boat. It isn't kid-ish like the other two Willy movies, and features less of Jesse. The whales are beautiful, and there is a pleasant surprize at the end. Hopefully there are more Willy movies ready to come out!"
5,remarkable,"Sudbin's is certainly one of the most remarkable Rachmaninoff discs to come down the pike in recent years. The playing is bold, colorful and the technique is matchless. Beautifful sonics a bonus. Don't miss it."
1,Quite poor thriller,"This is one of the worst thrillers / mysteries I have read. The characters are unbelievable, the dialogue is exceedingly disappointing .. what else can I say?"
5,MAAB IS ON THE RISE,"This album is as real as it gets. GET IT NOW also get the S.L.A.B.-ED version, it is sick"
1,Someone who has had a wonderful experience in Christian Scie,"I just am amazed that some of the reviewers here actually credit this False and unreliable story of ""fiction"" as a ""reliable"" source! They even go on to thinking this garbage is true! Christian Science is far from being a cult and obviously these reviewers are non-Christain Scientists who know nothing about the religion except for all the ""NEGATIVE"" things they read, or they , like the author failed to grasp what Christian Science is all about. If one wants to get a fair and honest opinion they should read ""MARY BAKER EDDY"" by Gillian Gill, a NON CHRISTIAN SCIENTIST. Also they should take a walk to the Christain Science reading room and read the Science and Health, but actually READ IT! Obviously something MS. KRAMER did not do! This author had a bad experience but instead of trying to correct it in a Spirtual manner, she decides to balme it on a religion and its founder. VERY SAD!"
4,10 year old son loves it!,These are terrific teaching tools. My son loves all of the CS in this series and watches them over and over again.
5,Great product.,Ordered this product for a friend. It arrived on time and my friend is very happy with the item. It is small enough for her needs.
3,Leg fell off after a couple uses,"I really like the steamer, but after just a few uses, a leg fell off. I'm just a few days past the return date and so I'm pretty bummed. I tried to use it without the third leg, but it just doesn't work."
2,Okay but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend,"The basket is great, but I can't get the little spindle handle to screw into the basket no matter how much my husband or I have tried. So the basket is nice quality but definitely not as handy if I can't easily lift out steaming veggies with that handle."
5,Great Product,This product is easy to use and compact. I have a very small house/kitchen and little to no storage space this folds up to fit in a very small space. It is also very practical compared to spending a ton of money on a steamer pot.
3,OK,The plastic handle works great to get the steamer out of the pot.The steamer seems like it could be a little better quality though. The legs started coming unscrewed after a few uses and they have also bent a little.
3,Misleading,"I bought this product thinking it was the large 11' size steamer and it was the smaller one at only 9"". I had impression from product photograph it was larger as the 9"" size was NOT shown in copy as it is now!When it arrived I never used it to see how the long metal holder operated. I have two others in small 9"" size so just packed up and returned for full refund.Steamers come in two sizes and I wish all vendors selling them would be clear in stating size in description."
1,Broke before I could even use it!,"What else can I say but that one of the legs broke off right after I washed it, before I could even use it!"
3,Great idea but stem didn't slide that easily,"I thought the stem would pop up easier than it did. In order to put the lid on the pot I used I had to push the stem down which defeated the purpose of why I purchased this steamer. If you have a taller pot, you can leave it all the way up and you don't have to put your hand so close to the heat to remove the basket."
2,The Stem is too high,"As mentioned in other reviews, the stem of the steamer is too high. I have two pots that accommodate the height, but recently bought a new pot and it doesn't fit that one. I bought two of the steamers. The stem on both are wobbly and I'm unable to tighten it. It works okay, but there should be better alternatives."
2,Not Safe for a Baby,"I purchased the Elegant Blue Baby Bottle Bank on Amazon through another seller as a baby shower gift. It looked like a great idea and I was sure the new mom was going to appreciate it! However, when I received the product, I was shocked to note it was made out of cheap plastic and the edges of many of the items inside were rough. There was no way I could hand this over to somebody as a gift, especially when there was a newborn involved. I returned it immediately and thankfully, without any hassle. I really have to say - I would not recommend this product for your own child or that of any other. Please buy something else."
3,OK I JUST GOT IT FOR THE COP THEME SONG !,I STILL LIKE THE LP BETTER BUT THE COP THEME IS HARD TO FINED YOU CANT GET THE OTHER THEMES ON BETTER CD NUFF SAID !
3,Not one of my favorite by Brand,"This is just a little too convoluted for my taste. Turns, turns again, turns upside down, and leaves us all breathless."
1,Piece of Junk // Do not recommend purchasing,"I'd give this zero stars if I could. First of all, I thought this was set up similar to the bookshelves that fold up and require no assembly. However, for this little gem, some ""assembly"" is required. You have to hammer in dowels to hold 3 of the 5 shelves. When I started pounding in the dowels, the rack started coming apart. After pounding it back together, it wouldn't hold. I was not about to trust that it would hold multiple bottlles of wine. It is going back. I don't believe you have to spend a fortune on a wine rack that is going to be in a closet, but this isn't that wine rack."
1,"cheap, half-broken, banged up and not even worth the price","I guess you get what you pay for. Package arrived half unwrapped / poorly taped, and the wine rack itself is cheaply made. Half the factory-installed screws were already ripped out of the wood, two of the shelves are crooked, and it took 30 minutes to install the other two shelves using just their cheap dowels. Not even worth the trouble to return it but buyer beware - something from either a better, higher-end vendor or Ikea would be much better than this."
2,wobbly and unstable,"I got this rack and put it together. Putting it together was easy enough but then I started to take a look. The whole thing was unstable and I wouldn't have trusted filling this thing up with wine for anything. The shelves that came pre-assembled were coming off the rack. I had to drill a few wholes and add a few more screws to shore this thing up. Sort of took the collapsable and easily stored features out of the product, but I had to do it so the thing would hold my wine."
4,Good nerdy compilation,This two cd set covers a lot of ground (up until the late forties) and supplies some extremely nerdy and detailed liner notes (with a French translation!). Not exactly a HANDSOME edition: the design is pretty bareboned. But as thorough an introduction to the Texas Playboys as one can hope for. I recommend it.
4,Great fun,"I bought 2 of these for 4 year old twins. One of them worked great, the other had a problem with the sound, instead of echoing what was said it would give off screeching sounds. I got a replacement immediately and that one worked perfectly. The kids loved the echo machines, as did most of the adults who tried them and pretty much wanted to get echo machines for themselves."
2,Amateur,"Absolutely horrific. His talent is questionable at best, his lack of training shows, and his voice is certainly below average. In addition, there seems to be no emotional depth in his music whatsoever, and frankly the lyrics are overdone.(""I know we've just met yesterday"") Yea, been there done that. Very unoriginal and a shame to our brown people.But on the other hand, I gotta give him props, just cause he's a brown person with a CD and actually finding success internationally, even if its unwarranted."
4,Tom and Jools,What a fabulous album! Every song is loaded with rhythm and soul. These two need to get together more often.
5,Great book if you are from Philly,"If you grew up in Philly or are familiar with the city, this is a fun book to read. I really enjoyed the histories of the various street names."
4,Good Battery,"Good Battery for the money. I own a Sony Vaio so the battery sticks out a little causing the laptop to sit on an angle when on a counter/desk top. Also makes it difficult to store in my travel bag, usually have to remove the battery. Otherwise it is very good and keeps a very good charge, much better than the Sony battery that came with my laptop."
2,Died after one year.,"I bought this just over a year ago on Amazon, as a replacement for the old battery in my Sony laptop Vaio model VGN-FE700G. It fit and worked great for about one year, then there was a loud pop and it died. It will no longer hold a charge and must be replaced. The negative rating is solely because it only lasted about a year - just past the warranty period."
5,A handy tool,This book is good for diabetics or anyone counting carbohydrates. Some extraneous information (protein and sodium) is included. Most major resturant chain foods are included. Must use index in back to locate foods since book is not alphabetic.
2,its still not here?,"I had ordered this Dec. 27th. It took over 3 weeks to get, so starting my new years resoulution on dieting had to wait. This is the first time this has happened. I just wished i would have recieved an email letting me know how long it was going to take. Dont accept an order unless it will go out in 7-10 days.As far as the book, its great! Service not so great!"
4,Very helpful,"I needed something small to carry in my purse, and a friend had this. Very easy to use, and I'd recommend it to any friends who needed help counting calories. The price was right, also."
3,Eat This Not That,"Excellent for those who eat out a lot. Many excellent exchange ideas. But, it's not what I expected. I almost never eat out (a few times per year). The print is tiny and often in a color that is difficult to read."
4,helpful meal advice,"As my son was just diagnosed with insulin dependant diabetes, this book was very helpful from the minute we came home from the hospital. The next meal was in 3 hours and we needed to count every carb. We keep it our car for in case we are out to eat during the day. Perfect pocket book for us.I would appreciate more of a international selection and less fast food but it really did have quite a variety."
1,A Press problem,"Our paperback copy of this fine book has been totally ruined by the University of North Carolina Press. Pages appear out of order, some pages are repeated, and others are missing. It's unreadable."
2,false advertising,"I purchased this item 2 weeks ago and was promised 7 pounds of plastic star anchors and screws. The merchandise was OK but there couldn't have been even a pound of weight to the shipment, but I was charged for 7 pounds in the shipping! There were enough rosettes to get the job done but there sure was not what was promised would be shipped. If they were to be fair with me, shipping should be refunded and part of my purchase money."
5,Acoustic music has never sounded so good!,"Acoustic music has never sounded so good! Colin Hay has reached perfection with his 6th solo effort. His mastery of harmony, song writing and guitar is unmatched, Hays soothing vocals and reflective lyrics leave you wanting more. If Hays vocals sound a little familiar, they should, he fronted the Australian Grammy Award winning band Men At Work. Since going solo in 1986 Hay has improved dramatically with each album. His latest effort going somewhere is the best acoustic album in years- bar none. If you aren't familiar with Colin Hay, or think it's Men at Work revisited- think again, Hay has achieved a distinctive style all his own. If you haven't done so already, take the time and introduce yourself to Colin Hay, you'll be glad you did!"
5,Desert Island Album,"""Going Somewhere"" is as close to the perfect album as one could imagine. It's a great entree into Colin Hay's music for the uninitiated, and stands up just as well nearly ten years after its release for long-term fans.And if you haven't seen him live yet, you really should."
2,No memory effect? Yeah right...,"I've had my Allure for 5 months and love it, except that the battery has continually lost its charge. I can still talk for about an hour, but when it was new it could easily go for 2.5 hours. Oh well, I guess I can't do anything but buy another one..."
4,Somewhere in the darkness,"America's best selling book, somewhere in the darkness by Walter dean Myers has won a Newbery honor award. As soon as you start to read you will never stop.A life of a fourteen years old boy named jimmy is holding his own little world. He lives in Harlem. He never saw his father and lives with his mom. Suddenly one day he was walking home from school, he saw a man standing in front of his house. That's when the book starts to get interesting.I will recommend this book as one of the best book. The writing style is very persuasive. The father of jimmy is very dramatic. You will never know what he going to do next. This book has professional language and easy to read. This book is like more reality then fiction.It is the best time to try it out. It will probably take you week and half to finish it up. It also has lot of drama. Don't waste your time go ahead and start reading today."
2,it was confusing and it just didn't interest me,"It was about jimmy, who lived with his aunt because his dad was in jail. Then his dad came and took him to chicago and then to arkansas to try to prove to his son that he didn't kill the guards that he was charged of killing."
5,Buy this book!,"I have bought this book three times. I bought the 1st, 2nd and now 3rd Edition because Mark keeps adding more great information. While I was studying for my MCSE, I did not use this book for exam cram. This book is a reference guide to the operating system. It's so thick that reading it before an exam would take up all my time. This is because Mark takes his time to explain everything in detail. Now that I've finished my tests, I use this for reference, because exam cram books dont offer enough detail. And now that the book comes with a CD, I can take it with me on my laptop rather than lug the 1800 page tomb with me everywhere I go. I can't wait for his XP book!"
4,Windows 2000 Made easier,"What can I say about this book, it's all been said. I found this book helpful in setting up a Windows 2000 server, but wish it had a bit of better structuring. This is the sharpest criticism I have for an otherwise excellent book. It covers all the bases."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE A FIELD TECH,"I've been a MCSE now for about 5 years and this is the worst read I've ever had in terms of application. This book could be half the size if the author simply cut down on all the flowery explanation and potification. He simply needs to tell you why things are done and then how to do them.If you have the time at your IT job to read a college-like text book, then this book is for you. If you want to have a long drawn-out conversation each time you have a basic to advanced question about a Microsoft topic, then this book is for you.Please stay away if you are needing to get the job done and fast, but need some sound, clear, concise instruction."
3,Sorry! Where is the information on IPSec (IP Security)???,"Sorry! I am very dissapointed at Mr. Minasi's 3rd edition book. Frankly, there is some important information missing !!! So, where is the stuff on security, especially IPSec (IP Security), networking diagrams, etc... All I see is bunch of screen shots and lots of unrelated text to Windows 2000! Sorry Mr. Minasi, but, do we have to wait for the FOURTH Edition of your book to get the material we need to study for Win 2K MCSE??? This is ridiculous. I am dissapointed....!!! The series are nothing but a rip-off. I have the complete Mark Minasi's resource kit books. None of them are complete. He is using several other authors under his cover to publish these books. Frankly, Windows 2000 HELP files and Server Resource Kits by Microsoft are far better!!! -:)"
3,Not that good as the other comments,"I buy this book because all the comments on it are good, but I go through the first hundred pages finding it not that good. The book can be half of its thickness if Mark wrote more directly like the books on-line. Nearly half of the words are irrelvant to the topic. I appreciate the BOL writing style - straight to tell you everything. I still need a book because the BOL is not in a book form and I don't know how to print them in an organised sequence."
5,"Original, well written coming of age story",SKELLIG is highly original and beautifully written. The characters of Michael and Mina as well as their parents are well drawn and fully realized and I feel the book would appeal equally to girls and boys. The book is neither pure fantasy or realistic fiction but a unique and lyrically crafted blend. Michael's school life and Mina's home schooled life are nicely contrasted and though the book is set in England and has that definite British feel it is not confusing to the American reader. The book makes sense in the context of the fantasy character (Skellig) it creates and has a satisfying conclusion even though we never get a total understanding of who or what Skellig is though Almond gives us tantalizing hints. Too much explanation would have taken away some of the magic and grace of the story.
3,"Skellig,David Almond","I thought Skellig was a very well thought out and planned book.The way everything mentioned in the book fit in with the story I thought was very clever.The book always kept you in question about something and this way kept you reading it.It was very mysterious in the way that most things in it were not of the ordinary.I was dissapointed at the end because I was expecting more to go on with the main character,Skellig,and it was really just telling the story of Micheal's (the main boy) problems in life when he meets Skellig.This type of book I am not really fond of. Still I found 'Skellig' an interesting and certainly unique book."
2,OVERRATED,"What an overrated book for children this is. It was hard for my daughter or myself to empathise with 'Skellig' or with the children's love for him. His character was undeveloped beyond the morbid descriptions and habits of his eccentric predicament. Neither were we comfortable with some of the inappropriate language used to give the book a 'normal kid experience' or 'street cred' feel. With there being so many more imaginative, enriching new books out there I do sincerely wonder why this one has been so well received. Is it perhaps an overreaction to the current success of the more entertaining style of Rowling."
3,Skellig,Skellig was an interesting but not a very exciting book.I wouldn't say it was exciting because nothing really happened after they found Skellig.It was like a diary entry after that.I enjoyed the book because it was very imaginative and kept me wondering what would happen at the end.I would have given the book five star if was more exciting.
1,Needs special Charger,I purchased 2 of these high powered batteries for my 5 year old guns and received them just find out that I need a special charger which I cant find anywhere unless I buy an entirely new gun. It wood be nice if this info was posted on the site and not just on the box when I received it. The batteries were shipped in a timely fashion and in perfect shape. But only good for a one-time use since I cant charge them with my 15-min charger.
3,Murder most local,I don't normally read true crime but the connection to the area where I now live was enough for me the book. I wish the writing style of these crimes was a little less flippant and a little more coherant. My favorite of the set was the last one in the group. I have to wonder if Jerome von Selz was in the back of Bob Kane's mind when he created the Joker.
1,dumbbells stained my furniture,"These dumbbells are advertised as having non marking vinyl coating. I set them down on my white Lexington table, and later found purple stains where the dumbbells touched the table. There should be a warning about this in the advertisement. I tried cleaning solutions but nothing worked."
1,Not Much Power,"I bought this for cabinet installation. In tried to put a 2 1/2 inch screw into the side of a cabinet to connect two wall cabinets. It would not do it. It screwed most of it in, but it woukld not screw the last half inch in. Also I also tried to take out the same size screw that I had put in earlier with a 14 volt regular cordless drill. It could not do it. The Makita angle drill kept popping the built in circuit breaker in the drill, which is a great feature. The other review on this page says it has enough power for what it is designed for. Yes it does if you want to pre drill pilot holes for every screw you set or taking cabinet doors off. But sinking screws in studs is another story. I think an inexpensive corless screw driver would do just about as good a job doing that. I don't recommend this drill at all."
1,Not Happy with Amazon.com,"i would like to review this product, but since it is a discontinued item that Amazon still offers for sale on its' website, and then the wrong product is shipped from the manufacturer. I really have nothing good to say about this product or Amazon.com."
3,Fun light movie,"Rainy day movie. Simple plot that makes you feel like you are reading a romance novel. I guess I would classify this as a beach read except it is a movie. Not to complicated, but enjoyable."
2,"Shows, doesn't tell.","If this were a novel, I'd love its exposition: all show, no tell. Sadly, this is a Calculus textbook that gives examples, but seems not to care about explaining the topic. If it just did a poor job with its explanations, that'd be one thing, but it seems to leave them out altogether at certain points, and at others, presents a concept via an example before the explanation."
3,Eh....,"In this novel, Layla, the main charecter, is a bored housewife who is able to wish herself away to magical places. The setup is charming enough, but the book is unable to live up to its premise. The charecters seem to be merley prototypes of fairy tale charecters, and it is difficult to sympathize with them. This book seems to be a fairy tale, but the magic seen in The Little Prince and other tales is absent. The author tries too hard to fit it in this genre."
3,Dreamweaver 101,"I have been using Dreameaver for a few years and have been looking for a more advanced book. When I saw the title ""Mastering Dreamweaver 3"" I thought it may be what I needed.. However, Once I recieved the book I found it filled with endless chapters on using basic tools in Dreamweaver and only one or two chapters covering more advanced topics.. The book also uses several chapters to introduce Fireworks.. Overall I feel the book does a good job in covering Dreamweaver and would be a good book for someone getting started-- but if you have already been using Dreaweaver for at least 6 months this book will probably not teach you anything new.."
3,Not Bad Not Great,"I gave the album three stars because of the track selection and pacing mainly. What's here is mostly great, except for Not Enough. Yuck! Why not put on Don't Tell Me, Aftershock, or Seventh Seal instead? Out of the three new songs, Up For Breakfast is the only one I like. The other two are awful, in my opinion. I like the beginning of ""Learning to See"", sounds sort of Stone Temple Pilotish, and then it turns pretty lame. I liked hearing the Hagar stuff remastered, especially the OU812 tunes. With the live tracks, why not put two Sammy songs, and two live Roth songs. Now that would have been cool! Not bad though, all in all. Saw them in Hartford last month, and they were amazing!!Bob"
2,This remastering job isn't good,"The song list is great. I don't care that the Dave stuff is mixed in with the Sammy stuff. It's all good.The two stars are there because of the mastering job. What ""remastering"" really means is this: ""We're going to throw a bunch of compression on the original mix. It doesn't matter that we're adding distortion (where it doesn't belong), raising the noise floor, and killing the dynamics, as long as we can get more level out of it. The folks that mastered Van Halen's previous studio albums didn't know what the hell they were doing anyway.""I would never have bought this if it wasn't for the three new Sammy songs. Unless you need the complete Van Hagar era, stay away from this."
1,"Music in an artform, don't make me laugh!","Some people may like the new tracks, but from reading these reviews a hell of alot don't. You can't force people to like summit just because YOU do! This album is nothing special and thats that."
4,"Good Stuff, just a few things missing.","Overall a pretty good compilation, just not enough songs! The three live tracks are from the ""Live: Right Here, Right Now"" CD which isn't that great to begin with, why not just use some old soundboard recordings instead? Or a 3rd bonus disc with the Gene Simmons VH demos?"
2,OK compilation but defect in CD,"The bottom line: the compilation is OK (a little lacking in the David Lee Roth department) and the new songs are forgettable. My biggest complaint - the end of ""Finish What Ya Started"" is cut off - no fade out, nothing. Is this a defect in the CD or intended?"
1,It's no dam good !,The only people who will like this are the people that did not buy the 'Best of' Album. The people that already own the 'Best of' Album can only wonder why Van Halen have released this. I therefore find this album totally unnecassary and disappointing.
1,5150=51% of a great era 50% of a crap era,"Who are these reviewers? Ignore the bad reviews! If people don't mind parting with their hard earned cash to buy repeat records with a different cover then what are they on? The DLR era made Van Halen what it is now. They may never of been heard of it if weren't for DLR. Sammy (bleach heard old whining git) Hagar's career would be over now if it weren't for VH. The Hagar era is mediocre at best. The new tracks on this record suck. Thankfully I have never bought a record from their Hagar era. This record stands up to the 5150 studio name, because with DLR it's 51% fantastic and with Hagar it's 50% crap."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"I'm sorry....I was drunk. Don't know what I was dri...er, I mean THInking but...once again...I fudged it. You're all right...I SHOULD have got Roth back. Did you actually HEAR sammies lyrics....lol. Man I gotta quit with the boozin..lol."
2,2 different bands...............,"The biggest thing I noticed from listening to this album is that it sounds like two different bands. It's almost as if Van Halen stepped down from being the back street raw metal band of the 70's/early 80's to some sort of mediocre glam rock band. One things for sure, if they hadn't had such a good start then they wouldn't be going now. Hagar has to be thankful to Mr Roth for that."
1,Album Release Is A Total Waste of Time and Money,"DO NOT BUY THIS VAN RIP-OFF Release. The 3 new songs don't even sound like Van Halen, the lyrics must have been written by a 2 year old, and the vocals are horrible. The rest of the 2 CD's were released on the last Best Of, and other previous albums, so why did I buy the same old stuff again. Just dumb!Eddie Van Halen said he had written enough new material for 10 new albums, and this is all we get. Total rip-off!. One of the CD's also has a defective track, which makes the 3rd Van Halen album release in a row with problems. This band should have retired years ago, when they still had some dignity!This album is nothing more than a cheap money grab."
1,Yawn...,"How many greatest hits packages are we going to get? Many of the same songs that were on ""Best of Vol 1"" are on this one too. The DLR era is far better than the SH era, but I'd like to hear some more new music instead of a new assortment of old songs.As far as the new tunes in this edition, yawn...nothing new after all this time off. C'mon, release some of that energy Ed! Sammy's lyrics are witless and boring per:usual... ""Sammy, ever heard of subtle sexual inuendo?""At least when Dave was in the band they were fun, now they seem to take themselves way too seriously. Get over yourselves and create something inovative or at least interesting...Please... With the state of hard rock music right now, the time is right for a classic band to make some impact, if they would just go into the studio, relax and have some fun."
5,great tool bag,I bought this bag to replace my bucket tool bag. It is great. It has lots of room and it is heavy duty. I recommend it.
4,An L.A. man's view of the dating game.,"Rodney displays the fears most of us have, both men and women. He knows what he wants but has for one reason or another been unable to obtain that certain relationship. After attending his best friend's wedding, main character, Rodney begins to contemplate love in his own world. He compiles a list of the 133 women he has had a relationship with, whittles that list down to the all important top 3 and goes on a quest to find each woman and attempt to find out if love is better the second time around. What Rodney does not seem to realize is that there is no second time, just an intermission and a continuation of the first time.This is an easy read and interesting in that is is a man's view. A good summer read."
2,Lacks Spunk,"This book lacks a lot of spunk that most African-American novels of today offer. After reading several online reviews of nothing but praise, I was truly disappointed. I accidentally left this book at a hotel on vacation and was not upset about the loss."
2,one woman short,"This was an okay book. It was not to exciting. Really, I mean it was a boar. I was kind of dissapointed because I had just finished reading 10 straight good books. But this book was something to read if u have nothing else to do."
1,Not a happy customer,The DVD was all scratched and does not work! I had to throw it away. NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER with this provider.
4,Weight Watchers/always good,"They have just so many different ways to cook things and so many great cookbooks. We love chicken, so it's great to have lots of different ideas on how to fix it up different and tastes so good."
5,Weight Watchers New Complete Cookbook,I actually ordered two books. One for my home and one for my cabin and the books were in better shape than advertised. I'm very pleased.
2,What am I missing?,"I bought this book with the idea of jumping enthusiastically into the program. Three days and 65.00 later I am pulling my hair out trying to get started. First of all, I expected a self directed set up, along with suggested meal plans (not the case). I can't attend meetings so paid 65.00 for the online program. I've been back and forth with the tech people trying to figure out why the program will not let me log in. I want to take the book back to Barnes & Noble but since the book is sold ""sealed"" so you can't see what you're getting before buying, that's probably not an option, and I've seen online postings that suggest it's next to impossible to cancel your online subscription, so that's, no doubt, not an option. In a word, I think Weight Watcher's operates as a scam. Very regretful that I was sucked in."
1,I had to call and e-mail twice after my book was never sent!,"It shipped the beginning of December and at the end of January, I had to e-mail amazon (twice) then call to say that I had not recieved my item. The customer service was great, but it should have not been as big of a hassle as it was"
2,The worst of the set,"This vol. # 3 is the worst of the set... It really deserved a 1 rating - The only reason to buy it would be to have a complete set... Or to have that one song you want. If you think I am kidding, you be the judge - You can listen to it here at Amazon . com"
3,just ok,"This is good at times but mostly it's just ok. First, the sound quality ranges from awfull to good but never excellent. There are quite a bit of analog recordings on here and most of the stuff on here was recorded in the 60s. There isn't a lot new to anyone that has been collecting music featuring the harp. In fact, there seem to be very few classical recordings available featuring the harp as there is. the performances are ok but are old fashioned in the way they play as expected from old recordings."
3,"Hmm, well I will tell you...","I got this for our used to be guitar player because he loved dropping his picks, as well as losing them all the time. So I got him a set of these...Pros:-You can put it on any key ring and always have a pick with you where ever you have your keys-Never drop another pic again!-Awesome feel too it, made me want to play guitar! (but I play bass so never)Cons:-The pick itself pretty much wears down in a few weeks, the plastic on the pick literally gets sanded off by the strings fairly quickly, not sure what the manufacturers were thinking..."
2,Inferior,Mallet arrived with no Bessey markings and no place of manufacture.Inferior workmanship as compared to other Bessey products that I own.
4,all female writers/readers should read about,"anais was so frank & true to her feelings& what she wrote was warm & sweet,though her erotic story was still a bit leg-behind than henry miller's, she's still a very good female writer."
3,wabi sabied,OK for a beginning understanding but very over done. The concept is lost because it is too well defined. Wabi sabi takes right brain intuitive thinking which cannot really be explained. Through book study one can begin to map out a foundation. The rest is gained through feeling and insight. It is creative spirit. I do not think wabi sabi means rustic. The term does not categorize in such a materialistic manner.
4,This book is quiet and beautiful,"It brings to light a new way of seeing in an ancient way of being. It is a small simple book, fitting for its content, that allows you to open your senses as you read it. Wabi-sabi in a word explains what many know already, life is all there in nature. It also shows us the wonder of decay and the beauty concealed therein."
1,Crappy DVD,"Very sloppy DVD version of a good film. Shame! One hundred dollars for a copy that does not include the full openingand closing of the movie. What a ripoff. Plus, two discs were not required."
4,Solid Advice,"This book, as all of the ""Buzz Your"" books do, starts with a rehasing of Seth Godin & Malcom Gladwell. If you're familiar with their works, much of this book will be familiar to you.If it's not familiar to you, Seth Godin & Malcom Gladwell's advice is solid and 'cutting edge' advertising. While I'd prefer to go back to the original, the material here is certainly well worth reviewing.The remainder of this book is solid advice on what to do to ""Buzz"" your music. A checklist of sorts, if you're serious about promoting your music, this ebook is worth the download. Why? Because you're bound to forget, or not think of one or two or a dozen of the items on this list.So, while you're reading it you may react with a sort of ""duh! that's obvious"" or ""oh, I never thought of that."" Either way, you'll benefit because odds are you haven't actually *done* all of the things in this ebook."
4,Cute toy,"I bought this toy for my baby (6mts) and she enjoys rolling the dog on the floor, it being cylindrical and then crawling after it. She does enjoy doing this a lot; also uses it as her teether!!!She has not yet grasped the idea of the dog being seated in the car and does not drag it behind her yet.I would recommend this toy."
2,Predictable and Overblown,"I have enjoyed all of Anderson & Beason's previous techno-thrillers, which were well-researched, suspenseful, full of 3-dimensional characters and believable -- if a bit apocalyptic.However, ""Ignition"" was just a cheap Hollywood pulp novel -- oversize hero, oversize villains and a plot that seems to be on rails. It was *way* below their potential and I'm sure it'll be a blockbuster movie."
2,"Disappointing, Slow Paced, Predictable","I have been a fan of Anderson and Beason for a few years. However, even a fan of the two could not excuse this piece of garbage masquerading as a book. The story was difficult to believe. The Vilians were inept and incompetent. It was more a matter of watching the terrorists kill each other off. The characters were cookie-cutter, cardboard, one-dimensional characters with no depth and histories so laughable to almost make this story a comedy. Finally in what can only be loosely termed a closing the author waxes nostalgic and tries to stir up emotion for the space program with the most rambling and incoherent arguments this reader has ever heard. All I can say to anybody looking to read a good book is look elsewhere."
5,A Celebration of Midwifery,"What a fantastic book for aspiring midwives or ""birth junkies""! The book is a collection of articles, reflections, and birth stories from both lay midwives and nurse-midwives. As an aspiring midwife, I enjoyed reading about the challenges and joys of a life as a midwife. Readers will love the photos of midwives and birthing mothers as well. This book would be a perfect introduction to midwifery, as well as a welcome addition to an enthusiast's library."
3,Not what I expected,"I thought this video would take me through a basic kettlebell workout. Instead, it's a detailed discussion of perfect form for 6 exercises. It has the feel of YouTube videos that were turned into a DVD. I think the instruction is great, even if the delivery is a little flat, but I'm not sure I would have paid $25 for it if I knew what I was getting. Kettlebell Lifting I & II could have been easily combined into one video, and then it might have been worth the price."
