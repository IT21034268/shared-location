3,Good info,"All of what is said in this book you already know but didn't want to hear.It's written in easy, friendly language.All about how to live better, longer.I'm still going to eat my daily chocolate, and live as long as I do."
5,Younger Next Year for Women,"This book was very entertaining and inspirational. It's easy to get distracted and think that as long as you are healthy, you don't need to maintain. The authors clearly point out the fact that if you are not maintaining, you are deteriorating whether you are aware of it or not. Since reading the book, I've been paying attention to what I eat and how much exercise my body gets. I've always been healthy and I don't want to lose that in the third trimester of life."
4,Just do it and humor,"My husband bought this book for me (and he purchased the companion book for men) for Christmas. I read it over a weekend. It makes so much sense: use it or lose it, and lose it unnecessarily. I have always been active, but have found myself making excuses for not working out as often or as vigorously as I know I still can. This book explains why it's so important to keep moving.Since reading the book, I have stepped up the frequency and the intensity of exercise, as the bood suggests. I've found myself with more energy than I would have expected. Don't just read the book, follow the guidelines. Aging is required but decaying is optional."
1,Don't Bother,"I found this book to be a waste of my $15. There are tons better out there. First of all, I found his language offensive, there were many times when he cussed and actually used the Lord's name in vain as a title for a chapter. The info was okay if you've never read a health care book before, you would probably reap some benefits from reading it. If you want a good self-care book get anything by Dr. Oz Mehmet. Personally, I would love to return this book."
1,Nothing New,"This book was recommended by a coworker, who is also a personal fitness trainer. I was disappointed. It's a quick read, two evenings; but nothing really new or inspiring. Save your money and put it towards good walking shoes."
2,Suspect Science,"I am reading many reviewers pan Chris's sections but laud Henry's. As a reader with an advanced degree in the biosciences, I am concerned that readers are being given science information that is just plain wrong. I was so put off by the Dr's incorrect information about ""bacterial mitochondria"", that it made me question other portions of the science. If he can be so wrong about this aspect, what other things are incorrect? I will leave it to readers to seek a basic microbiology textbook to learn about the science. I think the only value in the book is the motivation from a believer in the benefits of vigorous exercise.I agree that regular exercise and eating right is good for you, but at least Chris doesn't claim to be a scientist. He's just a guy who found a regimen that works for him and desires to spread the word -- even to women. I agree that his comments are a bit misogynistic."
2,Don't Oversell This,"Well, this is beautifully performed but I don't think one should put Biber in any position next to Bach, Handel, Purcell, etc. I guess it's a matter of taste but I found myself bored within a short time and really didn't want to be. Maybe I'm missing something here but if you're used to Bach cantatas and Purcell songs, you won't be deeply moved (or interested) in this I think. Take it for what it's worth..."
2,Somebody Else's Music,"Thank God! I finally finished this book and only did so to see if the stupidest, meanest cast of characters ever written got what was coming to them (some of them did, sort of). The book wasn't badly written and the story could have been pretty good except for the people inhabiting it. In the past year, I've read two other of this author's books: ""True Believers"" and ""And One to Die On"" but may not try any more of her works. In the epilogue, the author (Jane Haddam) notes that ""the picture of Jane Haddam didn't do her justice."" Take another picture, Jane, and stop talking about yourself in the third person in your novels. I've never felt compelled to review a book before but this one made me do it!"
4,Good Refresher,"I purchased this book as a math refresher for the NET test, it did a good job of reviewing the basics of math. I wouldn't waste my time reviewing the geometry, there was none of that on my test. This book did not review ratios, which were on my test. But overall served it's purpose. I can't critique any of the reading comprehension sections, since I didn't look at any of them."
3,nursing school entrance exam,this text needs a better index system I felt like i was always going back and forth through the sections besides organization it had helpful reviews
1,Too Expensive,The price is more expensive than that of Walmart's. Walmart prices is less than $20 for each the same box.
4,A good deal,"This here is a deal. I do laundry for my wife and me. The boxes last forever, and I never have to worry about going to the store to get more, or even running out. The only draw back for me is it comes in powder. I make a mess of the washer with it. I have been told to be careful, but that doesn't help. I would say I'm a liquid type of guy.If you are in the market for a heckuva lot of detergent, this is for you."
3,Good buy but have seen cheaper in store since,I thought this was a deal and then the next week I saw that I could have gotten tide cheaper in the local stores using coupons. It was convenient to have the detergent shipped to my door though. The actual detergent works well...cleans my clothes and is gentle enough for use on baby clothes as well.
5,Incredible deal,"Note that this item is a bundle of TWO large boxes of Tide, giving you 240 loads at about 20 cents per load. I don't know where you're shopping, but to me that's a great deal. Plus, there was no sales tax as there would have been at the grocery store, and it was delivered right to my doorstep with free shipping, instead of me having to lug it from the store. This is a great product and a great deal."
4,Good,"Nice Book.. it Is only for beginners and intermediate readers.. you will not found the secret of clownfish, but I think that you have to buy it."
4,Really nice book on Clownfishes AND host anemones,"Of the many books i got, this is by far the most detailed. Also because it focuses on one kind of fish i guess.pretty detailed info is available on the various clownfish types, some of the behaviours are also listed to understand your pet a little better.not a book focussed on filling pages for sure. however, a bit more was expected for detailed trouble shooting issues concerned to behaviours.overall a nice book if you want to get to know your clown or the anemones."
1,Solo Improv for Expanded Piano,"As A great admirer of Methany & Mays, I too looked forward to the release of this album. I have Lyle's last recording and play it often. I was very disappointed in this disjointed CD. This sounded like a bad practice session. I kept going from track to track to find something musically pleasing to the ear, but alas nothing even close."
1,Stanley has gone down hill,"I ordered about 4 Stanley products for Father's Day gifts. Stanley's have been used in my family for years. I thought they would be a great gift for my husband who eats his meals at work. Well they keep the food hot or cold and don't spill but the HUGE PROBLEM is the SMELL. Yep the smell. See the Stanley products maintain the smell of every food put into it. YES I do hand wash the Stanley products. I have tried soap, vinegar, baking soda and even bleach. Nothing stops the smell. My husband has quit using all of his Stanley products because it smells like every meal he has ever had in it. It really stinks. WE can't even use the Thermos for water because we can't get past the smell to drink the water. My husband ony used his Stanley products for a few months before we couldn't use them anymore. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND This Product to anyone. It is so sad because my family have always used Stanley and now the tradition ends with me."
1,returned for credit,When received the cover/cup was missing. I called Stanley and they sent me a new cup. When I installed the cup you could only tighten it part way and then it would pop off. obviously the threads on the vacuum bottle were messed up in manufacture. This would also account for why the cup was missing in the first place. I returned the item mainly due to the poor workmanship.
1,NEVER RECIEVED!,I never received this product and have tried to contact the seller multiple times. This was a very expensive piece of jewelry!
2,Uh... what happened and when?,"I admit I am not a big fan of Greenwood's, yet for some reason I keep subjecting myself to his book. This book differs from Greenwoods's other novels in that this one makes absolutley no sense what so ever. This book is a jumble of ideas all trying for the same page... it doesn't follow a logical line of thought, nor is there any real character development. I enjoy the character of Elminster, but how many Elminster books do we really need? The initial Elminster series was good, then it just fell apart after that.This book is definatley a pass..."
2,Pathetic,"Sadly, I've watched this author's work get worse and worse with time. This book should have been great. It's a great idea with a great story leading up to it from the work of other authors (ie Return of the Archwizards 1 and 2)....but it was horrible. Nothing but a bunch of unrelated plot snippets from myriad other books thinly strung together in a most contrived and poorly written manner. I forced myself through this book thinking it must get better....but it didn't. It makes me wonder if some 2-bit college hack threw something together at the last minute and they slapped Greenwood's name on it. This author needs to get it together and show proper respect for this venerable character."
2,The most tedious Forgotten realms book I have ever read,"If you are looking for more stories about El's life then this is a good book for it, but If you are looing for a novel with a strong plot then don't get it. This book is frustrating and tedious. There are a ton of unrelated stories spanning El's lifetime, a great deal of which aren't even about him."
3,Visual learners beware,"I purchased this book with the intent of learning to weld as a sculptor. What I found was a book that tried to be several things at once and mostly confused me. There is a dearth of technical info that goes into lengthy explanations of welding techiniques. But the illustrations in support of it are somewhat simplistic and even sometimes counter to the written explanation. There are also several 'projects' which are intended to help the student progress from simple to complex. But the projects seem to make great leaps forward in complexity without sufficient explanation. I get the feeling this would be a great course supplemental in the hands of a skilled instructor, but for a novice or even intermediate seeking self-education I would not recommend it."
2,Bias writings,"I wanted to return this book the same day that I received it in the mail but realized it was cheaper to just keep it being that it didn't cost too much. I purchased this book to have an up to date book of Presidents being that the last one I purchased ends with the 41st President. The write up on all of the Presidents is pretty good except for the current President of the United States of America, Barack Obama. The write up is focused on his election year and his opponents! There are very few pictures of him out and about like all the other Presidents. The one good part of this book is that it does have a separate section in the back for all of the First Ladies. Great pictures. I would not recommend for anyone needing a current Presidents book. Copyright is 2009 so maybe there needs to be a more up to date edition. If so, I would buy it."
1,Biased Cover,"What a joke to include Barack Obama on the cover. The bias starts there. Can't change who the presidents are, but when our current president makes the cover, who has no legacy yet, I was convinced it was a persuasion for the innocent minds reading it. I convinced my colleague to donate the book to the dumpster after seeing who they decided to place on the cover. What a joke."
1,The title says Hot but it's not! This wasn't at all what I wanted,"Lenny's Sub Shop was out of their sale jars of their Hot Pepper Relish (That says Hot it means HOT, that stuff will burn your tongue off) and I wanted some to put on my sandwich at home. This stuff is not any spicier than pickle relish and just as sweet."
1,"Taste is OK, but not the least bit hot.","I don't know what else to say. Remarkably, hot pepper relish is hard to find in a grocery store, so I ordered this. I have to assume that the other people reviewing the product weren't actually expecting it to be hot. If you want hot relish, I would look elsewhere."
2,Same Old,"Virtually every song on this CD appears on other CD's. The order of the tracks is poor, transitions too much, to make it a good party background cd. The only worthwhile thing about the cd is that it's all from the same wide genre, lounge. So, if you don't have any christmas cd's, and you like lounge, this is the cd for you."
1,Not for me,"I have used various Pureology products and the only one that works for my hair is the volumizing. The NanoWorks dried my hair out terribly. The first time I used it, it worked great but each time after that, my hair became drier and drier. It's taken me 4 weeks of moisturizing treatments to get it back in shape. I really like the volumizing but this product is not compatible with my fine, thin hair."
3,If Warhol knew how boring they made him seem!,"Quite disappointed with this documentary. Considering that I'm very familiar with Warhol and his life, I was surprised at how boring the makers of this documentary made his life seem. Worst aspect of the documentary was the droning voice of the female narrator, quite literally lulled me to sleep. What happened to the fun, flamboyance, the entertainment in Warhol's life!!!!!!!"
1,intex recreation pool_ horrible,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS POOL_ YOU MINE AS WELL LAY OUT SOME LINER AND HOSE IT DOWN. THIS POOL IS A PEACE OF CRAP_ THE SIZE IS RIGHT BUT THE WALLS DON'T STAY UP, WHO HAS TIME TO DEAL WITH THAT! CRAPPY POOL"
4,Freakin' Awesome,I got this pool and cannot believe how easy it was to set up. It holds over 250 gallons of water. I got it for an unbelievable price in my hometown.
5,One of the great classic Hollywood biographies.,"Thomas's ""King Cohn"" is a piercingly well written account of the life of the Columbia Pictures founder. The definitive work on the intensely private Cohn about whom little is known and practically nothing has been written.Mandatory reading for any true fan of the history and business of Hollywood. The notoriously gruff and tough studio chieftain is brilliantly rendered in what may be Thomas's finest work. ""King Cohn"" details the mogul's rise from New York City song plugger to Poverty Row impresario to one of the most powerful men in Hollywood during the studio's golden era.Rich with stories of Cohn's legendary brawls with Hollywood luminaries and peppered with candid quotes, ""King Cohn"" is a captivating read and deserves its place among the great Hollywood biographies."
1,Missed opportunity,"Just who was this box set designed for? Surely not for long time fans, with only a few meager unreleased tracks from their early days. And casual fans will avoid this like the plague. I can only agree with the previous reviewer; this is a colossal missed opportunity to give the fans something of substance for the approximately $100 price tag. You know you're in for it when the last track here is ""Purple Rain"", the awful Prince cover they did live because Clarke's child liked it. Oh dear. This box set is little more than the band patting itself on the back for hanging in there for 40 years. It surely lacks as something us fans can treasure."
2,Beginners Only,"This book is very basic. Those with any training, experience, or knowledge of Project Offices will not increase their knowledge here. For beginners, it is a good introduction chapter to allow you to know what you don't know and seek greater detail elsewhere."
1,I expected a lot more,"Excitedly, I opened the package and started into reading what I expected to be a brief but comprehensive tome on how to set up a project office. After just over 1 hour, I had finished the book. The only benefit I realized from this book was the extra time left in my evening resulting from the lack of substance contained within it. This... book contained less information than one article in the Project Management Institute's monthly magazine...."
4,Right Length,"It's the perfect length to chain four bicycles together; however, it's a nuisance when not in use. It does not coil so you can't loop it into a circle and carry it on your handlebar or arm. Even coiling it around the stem of your seat and putting a lock on it to secure in place isn't easy because it's too thick. Otherwise, it's strong and ships quickly."
1,same item for a higher price,"2 listings of this product, different color, yet when receive its the same. its not yellow its orange same as the other listing, I chose this listing instead of the other one even if the price is higher because of the color.. yet its the same. the picture posted is misleading"
1,GRIM Island,I didn't like this book very much. It was probably the most boring book I've ever read. It was good in the begining but it was just stinky the rest of the time. I pray the next one won't be so boring.
4,"island, shipwreck",this book is really good so far im not done but i'm into the book .the book is great because its about these six kids and they get stranded on a island . im not really in this book to now what the hole book is about . my good friend told me its a really good book and so i got it and read it and so fAR I like it.i cant wait to read the 3 three books i bet they are really good!!!
3,An OK Book,"Ok, I thought that this book would be really good, but it wasn't really that good. I mean, I think that all three books should be put into one...and the first book has no real plot. I mean, I don't know. It's kind of a weird book that leaves you thinking, ""uh, ok, that was really a waste of time..."" But there are pretty good...sort of...anyway, I plan on reading books 2 and 3............"
3,Okay,"This product smells when the bottle is open, but there is no aftertaste from taking the supplements. I cannot tell how beneficial they are."
1,"nice looking, poorly made","this clock is exactly the look I wanted, however, the alarm rarely works. It goes off at the wrong time, or does not work at all. I thought maybe I got a dud, but found similar complaints on other Big Ben models. Avoid if you need the alarm."
5,A perfect gift,"My sister gave me this book after I started getting ""serious"" about my own finances in my late 20's. I sort of figured that most of this book wouldn't apply to me, but after just 20 pages I already understood why I needed to start saving more, pay off my credit cards, and spend less on insurance. The language is very easy to read. I definitely recommend this book!"
5,You don't have to be foolish about money anymore.,"The Motley Fool's Money Guide will answer almost any money questions you might have. From buying a house to buying stock, this guide answers almost 500 questions related to personal finance, investing, banking, debt, insurance, retirement, and even wills and estates.The Guide question and answers runs from very basic money questions to more advanced ones and often gives references on the web where you can find more insight. You won't get bored reading this foolish tome either. Its has some wit and a little humor to it too keep it lively.Don't be foolish, get this book and answer almost all of your financial questions from how much insurance should you have to how to understand a corporate balance sheet."
4,Prince of the Pond,The Pond.There is a prince named Pin who has something happen to him. He gets turned into a frog by a hag. Then a frog comes by and becomes his friend. Pin calls this frog Jade.Some events in this story are Pin the frog doesn't want to have his babies to get eaten. He doesn't stay at the pond so he goes to a well instead. Where there are no water snakes no bullfrogs and no water scorpions and good bugs to eat.Something I learned from this book is somethings that may be important to us may not always be important to frogs. Some frogs may have the same resemblance as us like we both need water to survive. A message that the author might be sending is that we both don't always do everything the dame and probably never will.What I Love about this book is that there are a lot of outside activities and gorgeous ponds. The amount of sunny days reminds me of a beautiful summer day. It makes me happy when I read this book. I think that if your
1,Popeye (75th Anniversary),I am extremely disappointed. I assumed that the 75th Anniversary Collector's Edition would contain Popeye the Sailor Man's collection that I remember watching as a kid in the fifties and early sixties. As far as I am concerned I was ripped off.
2,"Wait, Warner Brothers WILL restore Popeye in 2007!",Warner Brothers is in the process of restoring the classic B&W and Color Popeye Cartoons for a July 31 2007 DVD release! Original Paramount main & end titles will be a part of the restoration. All will be mastered from pristine 35mm nitrate negatives!
2,Bought Used,"Like this title suggests, I bought this game used. Which I'm glad I didn't pay full price for, because it would be a rip off.If you want a cheap game multiplayer game to waste some time between good game releases, then this is a game for you. You can play co-op with up to 4 people online as well.Levels get very repetitive. Easier setting is no fun with limited fun items. The catch is you have to play harder settings for the chance to find find items like amulets that change you into monsters. But the hard setting is no fun either, you're constantly looking for ammo and health.Another thing that sucks is you can't save when you want and can only do so at save points.Finally one thing that irked me tremendously: If you accidentally exit a game, not only do you lose your current progress, but your ENTIRE GAME PROGRESS. It happened to us, and lost everything. The game was basically reset. We just past the second level, so it could have been worse."
1,Not so great!,"I was really excited when I received this little book. I LOVE pound cakes and paid a small fortune to obtain this book. I am an experienced baker and although I already have a large collection of books I read the positive reviews and could not resist. What a disappointment! I have now tried numerous recipes all with very mediocre results. For example: the Pineapple-Macadamia Nut came out more like bread, Liza's Pound Cake heavy and fairly tasteless, and the Coffee Cake recipe does not compare to the version in ""Perfect Cakes"" by Nick Malgieri. I think the problem lies in how the ingredients are put in the mixer. It is better to put in a bit of flour, then some sour cream, then some flour again instead of lumping everything together. I really, really wanted to like this book. I tried numerous recipes but there was not a winner among them. The Pound Cake cookbook by Fran Wheeler produced far better results. Not recommended!"
5,great cd!,"i love this cd! Christafari is the best modern day reggae band i know of. get it, you will not be disappointed!!!!"
3,As dissapointing as the phantom menace,"I bough this book recently and was surprised to find, not only are all the pictures tiny, THEY ARE BLACK AND WHITE! It is increadibly hard to read and does not cover ""revenge of the Sith"". I have a few other Sansweet books ""the action figure archive"", ""the star wars poster book"" and ""star wars - from concept to screen collectibles"". But, young jedi, save your money here and consider ""Star Wars Super Collector's Wish Book: Identification & Values"" by Geoffrey T Carlton. I find that book gets used alot more, is more up to date and easier to read. Hope this review was helpful (I think I was being generous with 3 stars, I havent opened this book since I got ""super collectors wishbook"")"
5,Everything you need to know...,"This is one of the few books I really can say answered all my expections... Great technical details, yet in plain english... ENJOY!"
3,Not what I expected,"I purchased this book expecting some of the mythologies of the film to be collected in some sort of encyclopedic format. Instead I was pleasantly surprised to find this filled with many anecdotes about the filming of many of the great classic horror films.The text is very dry and matter of fact, and many of the stories are ones told a thousand times over. The pictures are well worth the price of admission with some rare candid shots and many publicity stills that are getting tougher to find. Some of the anecdotes and quotes were new to me so it was a fairly pleasant read overall.There are better books on the subject but this one gets a passing grade for a horror buff."
4,Keeping the Vision M Going,"I'm a big fan of the now old Creative Zen Vision M media player that I use in classrooms equipped for video and audio devices, preferring it to newer Creative products or rival ones. While the player itself has lasted a long time now, its data and player cords wear out fairly quickly from the frequent use and rough handling I make of them. This Inspire 2.0 data cable is an inexpensive and effective way to keep my old Vision M going. I bought several and have had no problem with any of them. I recommend it to anyone who like me whats to keep a good thing going for as long as possible."
4,Very charming,"The four stars are a reflection of this work in comparison with that of G. Heyer, one of my favorites! All in all though I found this to be a delightful read, clean and charming. Especially nice to see is the complete lack of sweaty love scenes that make modern romances so crass and tacky. A definate find for anyone who is a hopeless romantic and enjoys a little pure and light-hearted fun."
2,So-so,"I had high hopes for this book based on other reviews and what I could see online. However, I was somewhat disappointed with the book when it arrived. Many of the pictures are small and not very colorful and the text was definitely lacking in wit. I loved the premise of this book, I just wish it had been done better and that the accompanying text had been as witty as I was lead to believe it would be."
2,this is just a printed version of the website,"Book is surprisingly short and most everything printed in the book may be viewed at the website. I expected extensively more that what I saw at the website, but it turned out the book was pretty much just a printed version of the website."
2,Americans forgot how to cook!,"What with the Great Depression and then World War II, people had been getting by with cooking and eating what they could get, that by the late 40s and 50s, when once again there was a great variety of foods available and people had money to spend, they had forgotten what to DO with it. That and more 'convenience' items (bottled sauces and dressings, instant geletin and pudding, etc.) coming onto the market that people didn't know how to use, the marketing departments of food companies had to come up with a lot of cookbooks quickly.The pictures, one can forgive. Artistic styles change, and photographs deteriorate over time. And some of the recipies aren't too bad, if not to our tastes today. But there were a lot of missteps.I would have preferred if some, at least, of the recipies were shown, and sometimes the commentary is a little too snarky."
4,Perfect Mother's Day gift for your aging Matriarch,"My Mother's pushing 70 so she probably owned all the catalogs Lileks combed through to find these truly hideous and unexplainable dishes.If you don't know who James Lileks is, go to his website and see if his humor appeals to you. He's got a lot of horrible food on his site, but this book is the ultimate collection of 50s food anti-culture.It's vile, and you'll love it.Now eat your radish Jell-o."
1,Disappointment!,"This book looked funny but wasn't, unless you find a lot of references to bodily fluids hilarious. The author claims to have found a bunch of 1950s cookbooks belonging to his mother and been inspired to reproduce selections from them with comments. These cookbooks are funny -- as it happens, I own one of the ones he includes -- but the level of his humor is fourth-grade, at best. The book has lots of descriptions of the cookbook pictures, comparing them to brains, blood, vomit, etc. enough!"
2,Cute but...,"Yes, food in mid-century America was funny and revolting. If you have never looked through your grandmother's cookbooks or seen vintage women's magazines this might be mind-blowingly hysterical, but otherwise it will just be cute and a conversation piece for your kidney-shaped coffee table. The author's sarcasm actually seems vindictive at times, like he was personally wronged by a meat casserole with jello topping. Which I guess, COULD happen... but it's kinda weird. Visit Lileks' website, because most of this is online."
2,Good,I had to return the first one due to the fact that the knob where you change the date and time fell off. Amazon is sending me another one and I am returning this one.
3,Just Ok,"Full Moon Rising is about part vampire, part werewolf Riley Jenson, who works for Melbourne's Directorate of Other Races, as does her twin brother, Rhoan. When Rhoan goes missing, a powerful vampire, Quinn, appears on Riley's doorstep and asks for her aid. Riley and Quinn team up to find Rhoan and investigate the mysterious deaths of Directorate agents and determine who's been creating vampire and werewolf clones.Full Moon Rising was an ok book. I'm not sure I'm that interested in the rest of the series. I was a little put off by the lack of a unique plot and graphic sex scenes throughout the book. I'm looking for more action and less romance in my books. The book seems like just another vampire - werewolf book nothing original stood out to me."
5,Great Book,"Loved the entire Riley Jensen series. Strong heroine. Interesting urban fantasy and romance. Liked that these books had a strong story line, fantasy and imagination."
5,Buy This Book,"Simply put: If you have a Mac, you must have this book. Period. Insightful, accurate, humorous, and possessing the rare ability to explain technical issues in common, every-day english that even my mother can understand. The bundled CD-ROM is a boon as well, containing hundreds of dollars of (legal) commercial software (REAL, not demos!) as well as useful shareware -- plus the entire book in a PDF file, great for PowerBook users!"
2,Disappointing and unbelievable,"Sometimes a story is only as good as its villan, and in ""Because the Night"" the villan is totally unbelievable: A renowned criminal psychiatrist, who is also a psychotic, a talented thief, a drug dealer and a cult leader/manipulator. His motive: the acquisition of data? Please.I still enjoyed Hopkins as a character, but the whole premis of the book was strained, and there was no opportunity for the main character to really shine. Overall, a weak sister to Ellroy's other Hopkins stories, which are in turn pale comparisons to his other works like ""LA Confidential"" and ""Black Dahlia."""
3,"Early Ellroy is Fine, but the master of crime fiction ages like a fine wine.","This early work of Ellroy's shows the tremendous talent that will blossom in later novels like The Big Nowhere, L.A. Confidential, Black Dahlia, and even his first novel Clandestine shows even more early brillance than what is served up here is Because The Night, a must for Ellroy buffs, but if you are new or just being introduced to James Ellroy start off with Clandestine!"
2,Cheap parts,"Missing screws, arm guard broke after first use (rivets on straps poped off), arrow rest bolt (the hook that you rest the arrow on when loading and shooting) cracked after 3rd shoot. My son and i are NOT happy!!!!Have they tried this item? Cheap parts!!!"
5,Great Chopper,"I bought this because I didn't like the slap chopper my husband purchased. The slap chopper took too much brute strength. This chopper gives many uniform sized pieces quickly, without the brute strength. It is easy to disassemble and put in the dishwasher. It comes in a nice plastic container to keep all of the pieces together. Great! I also have the Progressive Cherry Pitter that works the same way and saves a lot of time. Great products! :)"
2,needs improvment,"I do like the idea of this product as it is a huge time saver, but it did break on me shortly after I got it trying to do carrots.If it can't handle hard vegetables it should not claim it can. Both the orange frame and the plastic base cracked. I super glued it and now only use it for onions and peppers. It's not any good for soft things like grapes or tomatoes unless you want them mush. Definitely needs some design improvement."
1,product description is not truthful,"This product was a waste of my money. It does not cut carrots at all, and it was very difficult to cut even the celery."
2,"Dicer and Slicer just ""Okay""","I have found this dicer a God-send for making potato cubes for soups and potato salad. However, I was unsuccessful with onions and carrots. I'm sure it's just me doing something wrong. It takes quite a bit of strength in your wrists and hands to use on veggies that are really hard and dense. However, even if I only use it for potatoes - I'm happy."
2,Hinge Broke after very few usage. Got to return,Used very little and the hinge broke making it useless. I have to return and get a replacement. Amazon did a good job in replacing this item for me with a new one.
2,seems much more promissing than it actually is,"I was recommended enthusiastically to buy this set. However, once receiving it, I found out it will not properly cut all the vegetables, and that a lot of pressure and strength are needed.The bigger piece is fine, but the smaller one is pretty delicate.I do not think it is worth the money, or even the hassle of washing it after use; a knife is easier..."
4,"Great Chopper, plastic bin breaks",I love this chopper. It is heavy duty and makes chopping everything a snap. One problem is I am on my 3rd due to the plastic bin breaking after a month or two of uses.
5,Wonderful,"I have used this item for more than 5 years. I am thrilled to find that my fear in chopping tomatoes is unfounded. Will try it the next time I need chopped tomatoes. My review however is to say that in a lot of reviews the breakage of the hinge is mentioned. I found that as long as I had the hinges set correctly everything is ""hunky-dory"", and I take out any frustrations, of the day, on the veggies I am chopping! :)I loaned this chopper to a friend and guess what? It came back with one of the hinges broken. I am NOT angry, I can still use it and I have. I do not have to slice any of the veggies I chop 'really thin', however, I realize that you cannot put a whole 6-7 inch onion in a space that is 2-3 inches. I did not realize I should complain about cutting onions and potatoes into 4 or 6 pieces if they are large.I haven't complained yet and I won't, this gadget is ""wonderful"". JMHO"
2,Worked great for about 6 months,"This was one of my favorite kitchen gadgets for the first six months I had it. Used it to chop an ddice everything from onions, peppers, carrots, starwberries, celery, you name it. Cut prep time way down. It was definitely a pain to keep clean which was probably my biggest complaint until the plasic feet broke.The feet are raised plastic with rubber rings. After a few months of chopping (pressing down on the lid) the feet began to crack the plastic. Eventually the feet broke through the bottom of the clear plastic catch/measuring space. Now there are two giant holes in it and everything I shop falls out the bottom.It's in the trash now. Like I said, it worked for a few months, but it's cheaply made and will not hold up under regular use. I'd probably not recommend this."
1,Not as good as the one I already have made by Cubic,"I purchased one of these made by Cubic but that is not available anymore and this one was a complete disappointment (I sent it back) the blades are not sharp and it just mushed up everything I tried to cut in it. My other one has razor sharp blades and cuts everything cleanly. I am so disappointed in this item, I was excited to get another one and expected something that worked well but it certainly did not. Hope the Cubic one comes available again but it doesn't look like anytime soon."
1,Speculation is not historical evidence let alone evidence,"Yawn, get evidence, not conspiracy fantasies based on fantasies. Pointing out a verse in the Bible and saying, ""Oh it's really talking about flying pigs"" doesn't make it true and is not evidence. Evidence is factual and can be shown to be true by a logical statement."
3,"Durable,, but annoying","I got this bag for school..it's okay, but I'm not thrilled with it. It is very durable, spacious and fairly pretty, but there are some things that annoy me about it: It doesn't have many pockets and the side pockets it has are small and closed only by a small piece of Velcro. As a result, i can fit many office supplies in and when I put the bag flat with the top flap open, all my pencils and things fall out. Also the white starts to look dirty fairly quickly.I have been using it for a month now and nothing has ripped, but as I said before its really been annoying me."
5,Rare fairy tales from the Channel islands,"German-born Kurt Wiese lived on a farm in Frenchtown, New Jersey until his death in 1974. He wrote and illustrated over 20 children's books, and illustrated over 300 books by other authors. Kurt Wiese was awarded many honors during his career including the New York Herald Tribune Children's Spring Book Festival Award in 1941 for Captain Kid's Cow, in 1942 for Lions on the Hunt, in 1945 for The Wizard and His Magic Powder. He received the Caldecott Honor Book Award in 1946 for You Can Write Chinese and in 1948 for Fish in the Air. He also won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1959 for The Five Chinese Brothers, in 1965 for The Story About Ping, and in 1970 for Honk, The Moose."
5,"Excellent, but pricey","Sequencing and sorting are important skills for kids to practice, and this toy makes it fun. The bright colors and handy carrying case make it appealing and portable. What kid can resist multicolored critters?If you have the money, this is a good tool. If you can't shell out that much dough or if you just think your head might explode when you realize that the little plastic pieces you paid so much for are scattered all over the house, you can recreate the concept for little or nothing with a bag of twelve bean soup. For more information on how to do this, go here:[...]Otherwise, buy away. It's a great product."
3,FYI,"The cap that came with my new blitz gas can is a pain to use. The last thing I want when I'm doing yard work is to struggle with a gas cap, so Iordered these to replace the cap on my new gas can. These are nice, and much simpler to use, however they were too small to fit on my gas can. I'm sure I'll find something else to use these on but just be aware, if you are wanting these for a gas can, they may not fit."
5,5 extra stars,"I LOVE Joe Landsdale. I came across this book by accident about 10 years ago. Now that I know that it has been out of print for some time, I feel almost like one of the chosen ones. I feel lucky. I certainly recommend it to the fan of macabre short stories, if you can get it (ha, ha, na, na). Good luck."
5,Perfect stand for the TV!!,"This stand works perfectly for our new Samsung 56"" DLP HDTV. And it was so easy to assemble. My 9 year old daughter and I put it together as a surprise for my husband. It also has enough room to house all of our stereo, dvd player, tivo, dvr, playstation, etc. components! I give it an A+!! Thanks Amazon!!"
3,it works!,"A lil expensive just for a stand, but cheaper here than in most places... but its all about the TV and its great! worth it."
2,"Stand Is ""Light""","- I have a 61"" DLP on this stand & there is a slight, but noticable curvature in the top shelf. Also, the bottom shelf sags under the weight of my center channel speaker (40-50lb?). Compared to the prior DLP stand I had, this stand is poorly constructed. I'll be kicking it to the curb as soon as I find a decent deal on a well built stand."
1,"DO NOT BUY for 61""- sags, bends, cheap materials","Top support sags in the middle (from such a light weight TV!), side supports bend out, needs to be all metal construction. Regret purchase. Does match the finish of the 61"" Sammy thougth."
2,Decent stand.,"The stand arrived with some shipping damage in a well-beaten box. Assembly was easy. It seems a little flimsy and sags a little in the middle when extended fully for a 61 inch television, but would be fine for the 50 and 56 inch models."
3,Looks good but little support,Great loking product that matches the Samsung TV perfectly. Cannot hold any significant weight on the shelves. Glass flexes with normal stereo power amplifier on it. Had to use support block to shore up bottom shelf.
4,Good stand if used for a Samsung DLP set,"This stand looks good and went together well. It also fits the Samsung 61 inch DLP set very well and is a good match. One comment. I received the stand before the TV and put my old 27 inch CRT TV on top of it for a few days. There was a noticeable sag in the wood on the topmost shelf after a few days. Apparently the design is such that the weight needs to be evenly distributed along the top. So be careful not to put anything heavy on this stand. Once the DLP TV was on top of it, the stand was fine. I guess the light weight of the DLP set (only 75 lbs!) and the wide weight distribution makes the difference."
2,"not well designed, thought out","I have always been a believer in buying the stand that goes with the TV and never had a problem. This stand does look good and fits well with my 56"" Samsung.But issues include:1) Stand is not deap enough. I do not have super high end componets or anything and they hang off the front of the stand2)The glass shelves are not near strong enough. They are sagging and again my compentes are not high end. For someone that has a heavy amp this stand is not an option.3) The whole stand leans forward and I really thought at first the whole thing was going to tip over. I shimmed up the front of the stand and that seemed to solve the problem."
2,Not impressed,"I had problems with this keyboard, if you tried to adjust profile while in a game, the keyboard locked up and wouldn't work even after reboot. Took a while to get the keyboard ""unstuck"" had to basically reset the keyboard profiles after using another keyboard to get back up and running."
3,Warning about tags,"This product is incorrectly tagged as wireless/cordless/bluetooth. It is, in fact, a wired keyboard. You can find that out by clicking the ""see more technical details"" link, but both the screenshots and tags would have you believe otherwise."
2,Mammoth of a keyboard but not worth the price.,"Bought this thing for full retail price about a year ago, and I don't feel it was worth the money. It is a huge keyboard and the software is pretty good. Probably best if you play FPS but for me, playing WOW, basically like any other keyboard. Its not backlit so you might want to look for that feature. You can plug your headphones directly into it which is cool. Anyway it is broke right now at first the space bar stopped working and now most of the keys don't work. I contacted customer support by email and basically they told me I was S.O.L. They said they don't have any sort of repair program and don't exchange keyboards."
2,CONS For Razer,"I don't see the cons of a Tarantula keyboard enough in print. If I did I would not have bought mine. I pluged my nice 2.1 speakers into the keyboard and moving my keyboard broke my cord. Nice speakers no more. I do not plug my expensive replaced logitech z-2300 into my keyboard any longer. The keyboard is illuminated but not the keys most used: w,a,s,d,z,x,c,f,g,r,1,2,3,4,5,6,shift,control. They have a place for a raised light to sit. Like I want a lamp for my keyboard. Next time I buy a gaming keyboard it will have the correct keys illuminated, not a place for a lamp. Consider the cons before buying."
2,Disappointed.....,I absolutely LOVE Nude by Bill Blast...but the perfume I received from Amazon was so old...all you can smell is that old alcohol smell of outdated perfume. I've never been disappointed in a product from Amazon....but this was awful!!!!
4,"Heavy Story, Light Read","I just finished this wonderful book after only two days. I couldn't put it down. Panzarino writes her own life story in a novel-like, episodic narrative style. She tells her story with shocking honesty as well as humor. This book is both eye-opening and entertaining, and I highly recommend it."
1,weak,"The reason post soviet republics are struggling right now is because the ineffective oppressive state machinery has entered into a transitory mafia controlled capitalism, BECAUSE of its communist roots. Its not the revenge of history it's the resultof it! No poised argument for socialism"
5,Am I Human Or Monster?,Would you call a human a monster? Could a human be an endangered species? Read this book and you'll really be surprised
5,They cut well,"I like these blades and buy them exclusively. I bought them to use with a circle guide but the cutter didn't extend the blade far enough to work. Not the blade's fault, so that doesn't enter into the picture in this review."
1,buh buh BAD,"Here it is, the stuff I try to warn others about so they don't do the same stupid thing I did: purchase any circuit party album. Take your pic, each and every one of them is the worst that techno or dance has to offer, [boomboomboomboomboomboom] with barely a change in beat. Yes, there are some vocals, but not very good ones, the beats that are there are just awful. This is a very boring series, and not worth a penny."
5,Fast Paced,Liked the fast pace and acting was superb. I think the British are exceptional at producing these types of programs. Thank you.
5,has worked great for years,i bought this 4 or 5 years ago and it still works perfectly. i like that it has a solid stem that plugs into my cigarette lighter so that i can position it where it's easy to view/operate while i'm driving.
5,Great service,"Item was as described or better, arrived very quickly, professionally packed. Recommended. Great Helen Miren UK Mystery DVD."
1,Too bad for all concerned --,"Helen Mirren, Dublin, London, New York, Masterpiece Theatre trappings and costumes --What's not to like?Alas, the whole movie. Preposterous is too kind. Every plot development is either signaled way way ahead --- or so absurd it is a nonsequitur. Heavy-handed, slow, tortuous ( yes, there's torture in the movie, but the plot has also been tortured).Disappointed!"
1,so disappointed,Sorry - I cannot recommend. Watched the ending twice - it's like a significant portion of the film is missing. I spent three hours plus watching a film that left me puzzled why I wasted my time.
5,"Fabulous, absorbing, breathtaking!!!","Did you ever wonder why and where our luggage gets lost? Or did you wonder how they operate those iron birds and we have no idea so far? I found many answers to those questions and many more! I am a frequent flyer and now I know many aspects of this system. I was stunned how they managed to cover so many areas of the operation and the movie has no flaws! So, do not ever hesitate to get this title and you will enjoy watching it over and over! My friends come to visit me and they never get tired to watch it! Thanks to the people who made this movie!"
5,Perfect for those with Latex Allergy,I bought two pairs for my mom who is allergic to Latex. Everytime we went to the store we looked for latex free gloves but they were never stocked. I found these and my mom loves them. She uses them everyday for dishes and other household chores and they do not irritate her. They are long enough so soap and cleaners do not get on her skin. I highly recommend these if you are allergic to latex!
2,OK -- but big and clunky,"These gloves are OK, they work well enough and seem very durable, but they are big and clunky. It's not easy to maneuver your hands in them."
2,Can You Stand The Stench? A Warning...,"I have purchased several of these types of gloves including this model. After a short time, the fabric inside inevitable gets wet. There is no way to remove the lining, so it stays wet, which feels nasty on the hands.The lining then begins to stink because it remains wet. Then it starts to really stink. Then your hands start to stink every time you use them. Then...you throw them in the garbage.If you get these, plan on wearing another pair of gloves inside them, because after a dozen uses they feel real gross. I think these would be a great idea if they could come up with a way to clean them inside. I tried turning them inside out and that was not only a chore that took more time than the gloves are worth, it only solved the problem for a day or so."
2,expensive and not much more durable than regular gloves,"these gloves are thick, and the cloth liner is nice. however after a couple of months' use, the cloth liner invariably becomes damp and reeks of mildew, and the rubber strangely becomes less flexible. in the end, i think using the regular rubber gloves and tossing them would be more cost-effective than these blue ones."
2,Too stiff for dishwashing,"I purchased these gloves because I wanted latex-free gloves for dishwashing. Unfortunately, the material is way too thick/stiff to wash dishes. Would be more appropriate for scrubbing bathrooms/floors where there isn't as much need for gripping small items."
4,Durable and Roomy,"These gloves were delivered quickly. These gloves are comfortable and roomy. They are easy to slip on and off unlike those cheap gloves. A little pricey, but worth the value."
1,Misrepresentation,This product does not work with all Ipods -- no indication that the product does not work with video Ipods was made in the online product description. I would give it and the company that markets it 0 stars but that is not an option
3,Billy Joel Live From Long Island,"Very sad, but as other reviewers have said, they should have remastered this from the original recording. C'mon Billy! Excellent performance, poor quality video. I can't complain too much, because bang for the buck, I got it ""for a song."" I knew what I was getting into. So don't pay much for this (less than $10)! Make sure to get the Stranger 30th anniversary collection, since it is a steal! It includes 2 DVD's, one made during ""The Stranger"" tour and the other for ""The Old Grey Whistle Test (BBC's ""MTV""), both of excellent film quality. Also, of course, included is The Stranger, remaster and a copy of BJ's actual songwriting notebook!"
1,"Absolutely Great Performance! Terrible VHS tape, of all things!","I've had this tape for many years. Unfortunately, I no longer have a VHS player in my system. My question is: who in hell owns the rights to this great performance? I'm convinced a release in either SD DVD or Blu Ray would sell like crazy. Incredible! Some of the garbage being released on Blu Ray is....well......garbage, while this landmark show sits idle on VHS tape only. ?????????"
3,Billy Joel 'Live From Long Island' BLU-RAY,"We need this concert released on BLU-RAY. It would be a CRIME not to reissue this FANTASTIC CONCERT in the Blu- Ray format. WAKE UP!! This was his most FAN INTIMATE concert he has done. It's like, 'EVERYONE I KNEW IN MY LIFE IS HERE'!!!I felt like I knew him myself watching this concert. And what a TON of ENERGY!! Liberty Devitto was busy too! But, this DVD is just a VHS Tape to dvd. I had the old laser disc years ago and it looked MUCH better than this. It's a shame someone is getting away with it!!"
3,"Decent item, poor packaging","Cute Spongebob keychain, intended as a gift for a friend and big Spongebob fan. Unfortunately, when the keychain arrived, it had scotch tape all around it, attaching it to the cardboard piece that came with it. I now have a sticky keychain that is not acceptable for giving."
5,I was amazed with the quality!,"I was really amazed with the quality of the DVD. My husband loved the Martin Show so much, I got him the entire series. And the pricing on this site was much better than the stores pricing. Plus I got free shipping! Couldnt beat it with a stick!"
5,Who's the biggest Martin fan?.........ME!!!!!!,"This is the season I personally have been waiting for, it has some of the funniest episodes, and it does have my all time favorites. The episode when he's at the DMV getting his license. An absolute must have for all Martin fans. I bought Seasons 1,2, and 3 all @ midnight as soon as they hit the shelf in the stores. So you can believe I'm going to be in there when this one hits the shelf."
3,SOS Help for Parents,Purchased this for my daughter. She has never told me one way or the other if the book was helpful to her.
1,be carful,I got thes today and removed rear panel in my exporer and fone that the conecter for the amp was wrong and didnot plug in and after 2 hr i foned wiring diegram for amp and cut and spised wiring to by pass amp pig tal ket was usless !!!!!!!!!!!
5,Better than expected,"The head gaskets in this set are genuine Subaru, the Fuji Heavy Industries logo stamped into them. I expected an off the wall brand. Good value."
3,The Craft of Scientific Presentations....,"The book is thorough and informative, written by someone who has obviously been there and done that. Though the prose isn't particularly inspiring, the information is good."
2,Overall Disappointed,"The first story was so bad I couldn't even finish it. I couldn't get into the second story although for me it was educational, if nothing else. The third story was by far the best and in fact was the reason I bought the book so it wasn't a total loss."
4,makes a good veggie burger for gluten free product,"this is a pretty good product, easy. It tends to be dry so I put more water (not a lot) and add spices. Better."
1,Uniden EXR2480 2.4 GHz Cordless,Two previous reviews by customers have noted interference by mocrowave ovens with the EXR2460 which is the same basic phone as the EXR2480 that I purchased.I HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THE INTERFERENCE WAS VERY NOTICEABLE AND I HAVE RETURNED THE PHONE BECAUSE IT WAS NOT AT ALL SATISFACTORY.
3,A Starting Point,"I would have to straddle the post here. I found this book to be much more basic than I had previously thought it would be given the community audience in which I found it. It lends itself wonderfully to those that are new to enema play I believe, which is a wonderful thing: in that I'd love to have more happy enema folks to share this interest with. However, as an enthusiast from way back, I found it personally boring, super basic, and far behind my scope of play possibilities be it the reality or fantasies within. But then I have done a large amount of reading on this topic prior to picking up this book.* Newer to enema play: read the book, it'll be helpful and give you some starting points.* If you've been doing this a while: spare yourself the money and time."
5,Great bottle and well worth the money,"This bottle is just what I was looking for ever since I discovered that nalgene bottles leached the chemical, Bisphenol-A. I remember the day I read the research on the chemical as I was sipping out of my nalgene. Ever since I have converted all my nalgene bottles to change containers. The Sigg Traveler Touch is the best choice in my opinion out on the market today. The design is sleek and the materials are high quality. It is so lightweight and I look forward to drinking out of it everyday and love looking at (I know I'm kinda of a geek). All in all I know I will stick with this company if I need bottles in the future. Go buy a Sigg and stay away from polycarbonate bottles!"
2,burned out in 4 months,"Purchased in August after trying about 6 different blow dryers. I really liked this one and used it almost everyday. 4 months later, I was using it and the power reduced and it smelled like the motor burned up. I let it sit for a couple of days and turned it back on and it still wasn't working properly and still smelled like the motor burned up. Very dissapointing. Unfortunately, the manufacturer warranty is not good because I purchased on Amazon...a risk I was willing to take."
4,"Great shoes, Great price","These shoes fit perfectly, are comfortable, and affordable. I only wish they looked a little darker like the picture."
3,men like f.b.i,"The men off Alien Agency look a lot like the f.b.i.I really like the bioplasm because it also has a molding container disguised as a dumpster .It has three men with it,agent raven,agent rock and agent poindexter."
5,Get this!,"Hey. I am a 13-year-old girl, and my sister who is 23 bought me this book. I have read and marked multiple pages for future reading. This book has really increased my outlook on life! I suffer from depression and anxiety, yet I feel so happy when I read this book each night. I believe that even adults would be enthralled with this book. So my conclusion is that if you have [have the money] or whatever, get this book!"
3,Reflection,"This is okay. I was looking for positive affirmations, and this is not that. It's more of a new thought a day, which is okay, but not what I had in mind."
1,Is Lime Juice Supposed to be Brown?,"I'm not sure if it's because the juice is organic, but the stuff is light brown like a spoiled lime. I've never seen lime juice any other color than light green."
1,"Nice character, but farfectched plot and crude sexual detail","This book features a strange by sympathetic character who lost his well-paying job, had to become a telemarketer to make ends meet, and has the original boss from hell who treats him like scum no matter how well he does or how hard he tries.But the plot seemed very farfetched. And, although I had looked forward to a book set in Times Square (an area I pass through at least twice each day), I do NOT appreciate sex ed when reading a mystery. Prior to reading this, I had had no idea what, er, happens to men's bodies (or the nearby furniture) when they go to those sex movie places on Times Square, and was much happier not knowing."
3,"The wireless works well, but...","the keyboard itself is a little mundane - key feel and breakover is soft, leading to a lot of mistypes - in addition the spacebar is noisy, making a loud clack every time you hit it (at least mine does). Definitely a step down from my Natural Keyboard Pro (which my wife now has...). However, for a wireless setup, it's the best I've seen - I do like the mouse!"
4,Not a heavy user,"I am not a heavy user and chose the wireless keyboard and mouse to get rid of the cables. The split keyboard has taken a little getting used to, but now very comfortable. I could see a where a heavy user would get up to speed quickly. I put my old keyboard away and won't be using it anymore."
1,"VERY POOR, there has to be better options","WOW... what a piece of trash! I like an ergonomic wireless keyboard/mouse combination and bought it for my computer at work but this model has little range away from the receiver. I was used to my standard Logitech wireless mouse/keyboard that came with my DELL computer at home. That has an enormous range and seems to be multidirectional. With the MS piece of junk, I was less than a foot (12"") away from the receiver and neither the keyboard nor mouse was detected. Might as well go back to the wired mouse and keyboard. Very very unsatisfied! Would not recommend this, even to Bill Gates... A big waste of well needed funds!!"
5,Wireless Keyboard and Mouse,Functions properly ergonomic correct if you do a lot of typing this is great to have
3,On the fence,"I received this disc from a French visitor and have listened to it several times. I still have the uncomfortable feeling that Ms. Alain is playing these pieces for the umpteenth time, and while they are technically brilliant, they seem a bit soul-less to me. I have an old vinyl recording by E. Power Biggs (who seems to have been at the opposite end of the spectrum from the Romantic school of organ music), and those recordings of French organ music, many of which are on the CD in question, had real feeling behind them. Still, there is no denying the power of this music."
1,too fast,"I bought this CD for the Widor and Bach. Both are played too fast. In each case, either the artist was trying to finish as quickly as possible or the technician accelerated the recording to get another peice included. In either case, there was no music, only speed. I was very dissapointed, because those are truely outstanding pieces when played at a reasonable pace. I am still looking for an excellent recording of the Widor piece."
4,Great lecture,The information contained in this lecture is the perfect antidote for any screenwriter accused of being too on-the-nose with their dialogue.Excellent advice & lots of examples. A great addition to your collection of DVD lectures from a great supplier who set terrific standards.
2,"OK, Limited, There are much better out there","We just got one for Christmas and will be returning it. The picture is average for all the ones we looked at in stores. We took an SD card with a variety of JPEG pictures to all the local stores that had similar models. Many were worse. Some were better. This one will only show digital camera files, not from a scanner or a phone. It will not play them if they were edited, cropped, rotated. We purchased one similarly priced at Radio Shack that did show a wider variation of files for someone else as a gift."
3,Deep Trouble 2,"This is my favorite book it's better than the first one,It's about Billy and Sheena spending another summer with their uncle Dr.Deep.When Billy and Sheena were swimming,they are starting to notice that the sea creatures are growing bigger,bigger and,bigger.If you don't have this book, it's good to give it a try."
4,Great for self groomers,This book will be invaluable now as I am going to groom my dog myself. The instructions are easily understood.
3,Clip Failure,"While this pedometer is small and works quite well, the plastic safety clip fell apart within a week. Bad design? I'm looking for a metal aligator clip to replace it with as it didn't seem worth the $ or the bother of complaining or sending it back."
2,Accusplit pedometer,"The pedometer is cute and well built, but I was looking for something like my old pedometer that measured miles, not steps. I would not have ordered the device if I had known that it did not measure miles."
1,Just another waste!!,"No decent information to really help me. I needed help potty training three puppies (different litters) all under 3 months, and crate training was just not working. Besides being very boring, this product did not help AT ALL. They are now 6 months old and yes, I finally have them going outside . . . but unfortunately now my mom does too. SIGH."
1,Totally worthless - save your money,"This book consists of about 80 pages, half of which are copies of TradeStation charts and simulations. The rest is large print with very little substance. This material might make a nice appendix in the TradeStation manual. If you don't use TradeStation, it's of no use to you.If you are looking for a good book which will help you develop your own trading system, I would recommend: Beyond Technical Analysis by Tushar Chande"
5,Book base on Bova's (1981) NOTES TO A SCIENCE FICTION WRITER,"The table of contents of Bova's excellent 1981 book contains many of the same items, includingthe two story examples. This new book is an update and expansion of the old one."
2,Too short and specific!,"If you are not a policeman or a lawyer, then this ""book"" or rather ""notebook"" should only interest you for historical purposes. I bought it, wanting to learn more about general observation and learning retention (I assumed that the book would deal with these topics in general - great mistake! I was even interested in observation as a detective, to be able to observe like Sherlock Holmes. This book doesn't offer you that.), but what I read about observation and learning retention was very specific, and centered around ""espionage-like activities"". It was funny reading chapters on how to understand a cover-up plan, and how to approach a building so as to not get caught by the people you are trying to spy on. The book is absolutely useless for someone who wants to learn about observation techniques in general. And although the learning retention techniques are useful, you can find them in plenty of other books. In summary, it was a partial waste of time and money. Sorry."
3,not a really bad keyboard,"Well, several things kind bad about this keyboard. The key prints are printed right on, i can feel the letters of the keys. One day, the letters are probably gonna start wearing off. Only 5 keys simultaneously. Not a really good keyboard for playing games."
3,Microsoft Ergo Keyboard,"This Microsoft ergonomic keyboard doesn't have the bells and whistles like the 4000's does, but the cost is half of the 4000. But It does please many of the employees in the company. If you don't need or want the programable hotkeys this would be a nice choice."
3,"Very comfortable, but mine had a problem","I found the keyboard very comfortable. Please note that this is PS/2 keyboard and if your computer has only USB ports, then dont buy this. I found a problem with this keyboard. I dont know it was specific to my piece of if it is problem with this model. The problem comes when we try to select multiple lines to text using the SHIFT + Arrow keys and then the END or HOME keys. Here is how you can reproduce this problem. Keep your cursor at the beginning of a line. Keep the SHIFT key pressed and press the down arrow key to select the lines of text. When you reach the last line you want to select, press the END key to complete selection of last line. The cursor moved to the end of the line but the whole selection is lost. This happens with the reverse also i.e. selecting upwards and hitting the HOME key. This might not seem like a a big issue but it irritated me a lot. I returned my keyboard. Haven't decided which one to buy to replace this."
2,Hard to Read,The days of the month are black on a medium blue background so they're difficult to read. A standard size and format would work better. Cartoons are great.
5,Icart Etchings,This is a beautiful book of Icart's work. We love Icart. It is a very well organized book. It is worth the money.
1,Lousy,"If you are looking for historical accuracy, don't look here.If you want to watch your own tanks flounder and rotate while trying to move down a straight road, while the computer AI takes them out with a level of accuracy that an M-1 would be hard pressed to match, then buy this game.If you want the computer's mortars to come down on you like they were laser guided, while yours seem to impact directly on top of their targets with no effect, buy this game.If you want to fight a battle to a ""draw"" and then play the next battle with your depleted forces, while the computer has miraculously refitted 100%This game is horrible. It feels like it was designed by a high school intern.Don't waste you time or your money."
3,Survival Island book 2,This is book 2 in a series of three. I am homeschooling my grandson and neededsomething more than futuristic plots. This fit the bill.It is a quick read due to the exciting plot.
2,"More Like ""Incomplete""","This book was a starting point, but was not ""Complete"" by any means. I was hoping this book would delve into specifics, such as how to go about obtaining contractors to have a coffee bar built, or give real life statistical examples of day-to-day coffee bar operations. Understanding the author(s) cannot possibly account for everything one would experience as a coffee bar owner, it would have been nice to get a picture. The good thing about the book, as stated earlier, is it gives ideas of things one should think about- such as payroll, hiring tips, color schemes, etc. but again, they're just starting points. It will be necessary for me to purchase another book to build on this one......bummer"
3,"Interesting subject matter, poor writing","While I found the book generally interesting, I was very distracted by the utter lack of copy editing. The book is riddled with what I can only call dumb mistakes, the kinds of goofs that a spell-checker wouldn't catch (such as ""affect"" and ""effect"" being used interchangeably, ""too"" being used instead of ""to"" and vice-versa, etc.).These errors were made all the more glaring by the author's unnecessarily florid -- I would even say pretentious -- writing style. For me the poor writing undermined the content and made me question whether the author really knew what he was talking about.In the end, the overall sloppiness of the writing made the whole book feel like a rather amateurish attempt to explore an intersting concept. It was the literary equivalent of a well-intentioned but shoddily executed Star Wars fan film.I think the author would do well to have a professional editor review his manuscript and fix the mistakes, then reissue the book."
2,really disappointed,"The look of this chair was really good, but it's manufacturing was terrible. First, when the chair arrived, the velcro used to attach the top of the seat was misaligned so it was constantly coming off. I had to buy and sew own a new piece of velcro which isn't so easy considering it is canvas. Secondly, the chair only gets about 5 minutes use each day, for brushing hair and teeth, but now I've noticed that the canvas that makes up the bottom of the chair is totally shredding and soon it won't be a seat anymore. I'll have to put the whole thing in the trash and buy a new one."
2,"So far so good, but till when?","I bought this even after the negative comments from many customers. So far, it is running fine. But one day, after about a month of purchase, the adapter started making loud cracking noise. I thought that was the end of its use. But it started working again by the end of my drive! It's working fine now, but I am not sure how long it will survive. So be aware of its problems before you decide to buy this :)"
2,Worked Well At First,Worked well for a good while until the cord broke. This is my third cassette adapter form various manufacturers to malfunction. Even still I have purchased another which is still functioning properly.
1,junk,This product arrived a day late and the package had been opened (through the Amazon shipping label) and resealed with clear tape. The product did not work and I did not return it as the return postage would have been 1/2 the refund.
2,"too much sound (not the one you want, though)",it makes a constant white noise in the background of the music you're playing
2,Works in one car but not the other,"I bought this to use in my 2003 Infiniti G35 (factory Bose system) after trying three different types of FM transmitters (all of which worked fine unless you were within 50 miles of any city with a poplulation over 10,000).It just did not work, period.I took into work and tried it in my staff vehicle (2003 Dodge Caravan, factory system) where it works OK. I brought the Sony adapter I had at work home and it works fine in the G35.However, the last time I was on a multi-hour road trip at work, I noticed the Belkin adapter is starting to make an annoying amount of mechanical noise. I may try to pop it open and see if there's any way to reduce the racket it's making, but I'll probably end up buying another Sony. The Sony adapter I have is at least ten years old and still works OK."
1,Don't waste your money,This product is aweful. It just absolutly refused to work in any of my cars. I tried it in a 2003 dodge van and it wouldn't even load correctly. i tried it in a 92 carolla... silence. i tried it my friends cars and it didn't work in any of theirs either. don't buy this. i wish i could give it zero stars.
2,What a piece,I had lots of trouble getting the tape into any tape deck and I would have to almost force it into my car tape deck for it to work. And as if that wasn't enough the wire striped and the jack fell off. Now it is out of service and I am out 20 dollars.
1,very annoyed,I selected this product specifically because the description said the adapter worked in both side-loading and front-loading cassette players. The model I received fits only side-loading and I need front-loading. Very annoying! Back it goes.
1,Dont purchase,"Within 5 months this product proved worthless. If I attempt to use it i enjoy a symphonic medley of 100% volume, no static; to 60% static at reduced volume; to no volume at all. Have used other ipods with it and received same result.Doesnt help faciitate your Ipod addiction and is frustrating as all hell on those long rides."
2,disappointing...,This is a very small cutting board. It still slips and doesn't lay flush on the counter.
2,Still got the voice - And still needs a good producer,"Etta never fails to deliver in the vocals. Gutteral bombast, sweet soul, gospel, blues, the lady is a living legend. But this album, like the last album ""produced"" by her son, is a nightmare. Chessy arrangments, tinkly bass, poor sound all around. She is a fierce mother and I'm sure she thinks her kids know best, but there is a reason why labels pair vocalists with the right producer. Should Etta get the chance to work with a fresh ear at the deck, she wouldn't need the novelty of some of the song choices.PS - 200lbs lighter and she remains the best live performer; blues, R/B, soul, whatever, in the world."
1,this is a depressing read,The stories in this book aren't enjoyable. I was excited about reading it but soon I reverted wasting time on the book.
4,Okay unit,"I found one on Ebay with 96mb total memory for a decent price. If you can find one on sale or on auction for a decent price, I say go for it.Sounds quality is excellent with a good set of earphones. Battery life is average. Menu is simple, and unit seems pretty sturdy.My only complaint is with the software. It often locks up, and will insist on putting files where there's no more room! I have a flash card in there as well, and the software sometimes doesn't want anything to do with it. Can be frustrating. Thankfully, Windows Media Player does file transfers a lot more eaisly.Basically, don't buy it retail. Look for a sale, or on half.com or ebay."
4,"tasty bar, but not the best","I like these. They're moist, chewy, and tasty. Good for breakfast or a quick snack. The only reason I am giving them 4 stars is because I prefer some of the other varieties. I like the chocolate one, the choc/coconut one, and also the apple/cinnamon one (same brand, although it comes in a different shape). If you are new to this type of bar, I would suggest trying one of those first, or get the variety pack."
2,Forced health!,"If you need to force yourself too eat less or have a healthy snack, this is the one! Not tasty: in fact slightly revolting. You would have to be desperate to finish it all."
3,GOOD TASTE BUT.............,I like the taste of the Raw Revolution Bars. The problem with the Cashew and Agave nectar bar is the consistency. It gets very soft and VERY OILY. I sometimes eat half and fold the package to close. With this one it leaks . Unfortunately I put one in my handbag and it leaked through ruining the leather. 8-(I like to carry a snack with me. This one will be for at home . Try the chocolate with coconut and the raspberry chocolate. I don't leave home without one.
1,Dont Waste Your Money!,Like some of the other reviews stated these seat covers do not hold up well. I used mine for about a month and they are rippimg at the seam. I have a smaller car and they seemed to fit well so I'm not sure what the issue is. I only wish I had checked out the reviews before I got them.
3,seat covers,"they look good but they did""t fit my seats very good seams are starting to come apart already and had to put holes in the top to put my headrests back on i have a versa and it is a pretty small car they are just ok ! so they wont fit over your headrest"
4,"Eaten at restaurant, but haven't gotten the book yet","I have eaten at Roy's (Seattle) three times now. Each time, I have loved the seafood! Not only were the dishes excellent, but the presentation was awesome as well. As I said, I don't have the book, but I highly recommend the restaurants. :) I plan to buy the book too, since I love preparing nice dinners for my friends & boyfriend."
4,Excellent toy for toddler,"My 18 months old daugther loves to play with it, because it is easy to put together."
5,To read again,"I bought this book back in 1988 or 1989 right after it came out. The copy is very well worn and I am currently reading it again probably for the 6th or 7th time. I may have read it more, not really sure. I have enjoyed it every time. It really is more about Cooper's philosophy on self defense, hunting and the erosion our country's values and traditions. This erosion can be traced to the elevation of ""girlie men"" in our society to places of prominence. This is my thought and not necessarily Cooper's We don't seem to be doing any better either. I read Cooper's column in Guns & Ammo and many letters to the magazine derided some of his opinions. More girlie men. Again, my opinion.I plan to get some of his other works and have no excuse for not doing so earlier."
5,"Much more than a ""gun book""","Cooper, a tireless advocate of self responsibility and personal virtue, gives this book enough adventure and colorful history to fill two lifetimes. Although it will be mostly read by the shooting public, this work is recommened to any who feel that our society has lost it's vision."
5,These are GREAT!!,"My son loves these bugs. They are educational when used for counting, sorting, and color recognition. i orginally purchased the discovery toys bug game and we lost all the catepillars. so when i saw these, i thought perfect, more bugs with plenty of catepillars. they are durable and fun to play with. we even put them on the trampoline and hit with our hands to watch them bounce. great sensory activity!!!"
1,A generic tribute CD for a generic band,Let me get this straight... A (pretend) punk band releases one album and gets a tribute album. This has to be a joke.
1,WHAT HAPPENED??,"I bought this CD because i am a huge simple plan fan! And it was HORRIBLE! These people have no voice what so ever and they just ruined the songs! I couldnt stand to listen to it after the 3rd song! I got it because im a big fan, so if you are then you can add it to the collection for looks. But beware DO NOT listen! Or if you do...do it at your own risk!!"
1,No Stars,"I can't believe that they rearranged the Insert/Home/Delete/End/PgUp/PgDn keys! Being a veteran computer user, gamer, and touch-typist, this keyboard is useless to me. Every time I go to hit one of these keys, I end up hitting the wrong one. Whose bright idea was it to change this key layout that's been working for more than 15 years??? What is Microsoft going to do next, rearrange the letter keys? Idiotic keyboard. Stay away."
3,A Different Kennedy,"Enjoyed this dvd, having listened to Brians music on cd and never seen him live i must say i found it strange,the whole performance came across as very like later Chris de burgh stuff.plus the older crowd of the belfast concert came across as verystiff, i was dissapointed in the fact that he did not seem to come alive with his music and the band seemed not to enjoying the gigthe sound quality is not great plus i felt it was over dubbed at timesbut Brian kennedys music is great this does not do it justice"
4,Great Reading!,"REBEL DOG is a wonderfully written, and clean book. The author does a marvelous job getting into the head of his central canine character. In fact, I often wondered if the writer was really a dog! Ha! Anyway, there is plenty of action and adventure in this story. I recommend it highly to both history buffs and dog lovers everywhere."
5,A great sing along for children,"This is another sing along that I've enjoyed watching with my children as well as others. I find that the wee sing videos encourages children to sing, dance, and do hand gestures. It captivates a childs imagination, and intrigues the children who are able to watch them with their family or friends."
5,My favorite childhood movie still exists!,"This movie was my absolute favorite when I was 5, 22 years later I am delighted that it's still produced!I am ordering a copy of it for my son who is now 2. I am hoping it's not too girly as I remember telling my mom that I HAD to have a red dress like Sally. :)"
5,A Favorite Oldie,"This DVD was what kept my own daughters happy when they were little, only back then it was on VHS. When I saw it was still available , on DVD, I decided to purchase it for my granddaughter since she too loves loves loves it...it brought back wonderful memories of my girls growing up . If any parent out there of a two yr old or older needs a DVD that's ""alive"" with good songs and is happy, they should purchase it. Thanks Amazon for always having what I need :)"
5,Wee Sing DVD - this one's the favorite!!,"This one is the one to start with...it's the classic that began it for my family! One of my sisters turned 27 this year around the holidays and one of the songs on this DVD was her absolute favorite for years! She loved the gift immediately as she has 2 small boys and now she's ready to get the rest!(back story) My sisters and I grew up watching the Wee Sing Videos when we were younger. We'd often talk about random scenes/parts from the movie that only we would ""get"". Now that the four of us have small children/toddlers of our own I thought it would be great to gift a DVD version this year for Christmas. Everyone's reaction was priceless and we enjoy playing them for the small ones! The older ones are already busting into the songs we know and love!!"
5,Brilliant description of Bernatz de Ventadorn's life,"This CD is brilliant. I enjoy it very much. It describes the Bernatz de Ventadorn's life (ca 1147-1170). He was a legendary troubadour. In this CD, someone can hear his love songs and the spoken description of his love for Eleanor of Aquitania. I highlight the quality of this sensitive work, executed by Camerata Mediterranea, and two songs: Non es meravelha seu chan and Can vei la lauzeta mover."
4,Good resource for ideas,"This is a nice little book. It's a little old, 1976 originally, but the designs are every bit as interesting and challenging as they were then. Though the illustrated patterns are presented as squares for afghans or hand bags, they could easily be altered for use in sweaters, wall hangings, and decorative bands for clothing. The graphed method of illustration makes the designs also useable for beading projects, cross-stitch, embroidery, and plastic or priscilla canvas needlepoint projects. Though none of the photographs are in color, this is probably a useful thing, as there is nothing to distract the worker from their own color choices, which will make the finished work, regardless of the medium, much more individual. A useful resource for design ideas."
3,celiac needed new grains,"I have celiac, and am also allergic to corn. SO, I bought amamrath because of an article on how it tastes like popcorn and can be popped.Plus it is said to be a very nutritious grain. I could not get it to pop no matter what I tried. But it does make a good grain for hot cereal."
4,Pablo,"Book started off fast, I couldn't put it down. It kind of bogged down half way through but I'm still spinning from first half. I may reread, b/c names get confusing especially w/ how many people he killed. The world is definitely a better place w/ out Pablo."
3,Too long,"Mark Bowden wrote Black Hawk Down, as everybody knows. I was looking forward to any book by Mr. Bowden, but this one is too much. If there was ever a guy who needed to be killed it was Pablo Escobar. However, reading the endless corruption and stupidity of Columbians was depressing, and furthered my low opinions of them. There is hardly a living soul in this sorry country who is not vile or evil. Anyway, the book runs on too long and I finally just turned to the page where he was finally shot, almost by accident."
4,A futuristic Doc Savage pastiche by master pulp author,This book came out in 1983 as one of an unrelated series of new books by pulp stalwart E. Hoffman Price. The action occurs in the mid-21st Century where 186 year old Doc Brandon faces the problems of a world that has been dumbed down and made so politically correct that government nolonger functions efficiently. Doc Brandon is a throwback to an earlier age of action. He has surrounded himslef with human simulants that he has cultivated from chimpanzees who form his trusted defense force. One of the female simulants is also his lover. In the story Doc's private reverie is threatened as dark forces seek to discover his secrets especilly the secret of his longevity. This is a rethinking of the Doc Savage persona as it would confront the strange changes in a more liberal modern world.
2,Buyer Beware!,"First off, let me say that these movies are great, and it is great to see them in hi-definition, I gave it such a low rating because of the lousy packaging.I was suckered in because you get two great movies in one package, the problem is, you get ABSOLUTELY NO BONUS FEATURES WHATSOEVER! Most multi-movie packages come with separate discs in a double case. Not so with this one.Strictly the movies, no audio-commentary, no deleted scenes, you can't even access the scenes from the menu. EPIC FAIL!It's common knowledge that a blu-ray disc will hold a ton of information, I feel that they could have done a lot better job than this."
4,smooth and smokey,I like the contrast of the trippy guitars with the driving base and drums. The singer's voice is haunting and full of repressed pain. I like how my mind wanders when I listen to some of the songs. Good driving music. Loss and Sweet Indecision are very strong...........
1,Terror,"I think the Amazon editor said it all... ""might not be a perfect vocalist...uses her voice... to terrorize.""I can only imagine the terror if you could actually hear the lyrics through all of the filters."
2,Perfect for driving me crazy,"Usually I am a real smart a55 when I write these reviews, but with this product I have to be a bit serious: This mouse about drove me crazy.Mainly, the scroll wheel. It scrolls way too easily and way too smoothly. There is little to no feedback, and I found the control panel settings for adjusting this to maddening. My fingers would constantly brush the wheel, which would then cause it to scroll 20 pages. It made me so crazy I missed stunt bike practice."
3,"Why move the ""eye""?","I've had the wireless intellimouse explorer for about 2 years now and I love it to death. The middle button on my original one just wore out, so I needed a new one. I got the tilt wheel one and it's great except for one thing.I don't like where the little optical eye thing is located. It's located off to the side, rather than the center and it affects my maneuverability with the mouse. As I move the mouse to where I need to click, I'll rotate it as well as move it. The new location for the eye affects this very much. Now, when I rotate the mouse, they eye is at the anchor point and so the pointer doesn't move.This problem might prompt me to return the mouse, if I can."
2,Cursor drifts,"I really wanted to like this mouse. It has an excellent shape. My hand folds comfortably around it. It's wireless, so I don't get cords tangled up on my desk. But. The cursor drifts after you take your hand off the mouse. There you are typing, or just reading, and the cursor starts drifting across the screen. A quick little shimmy of the mouse usually stops the drifting. But this shouldn't be happening in the first place. Very, very annoying."
2,"Won't connect, Flimsy tilt, Short battery life","Don't get this product! I returned one already.1. Won't connectMouse didn't work out box. Had to return to get another one. What a hassle. I wonder how long this mouse will last.2. Flimsy tiltWhat a lousy and flimsy design... How often does one use side scroll anyway? In any case, to use it takes large amount of finger extension and force. Lousy gimmick at best. And I miss the scroll with ""click"" as smooth scroll doesn't feel ""right"".3. 6 month battery life?Now that's a LIE! The damn Intellipoint software keeps on reminding me after 2 months that I need to change the battery and I used it only at home. I wish I got the Logi with built-in charger.Finally, I wish I bought the Logi with 600 dpi and recharger instead. I tried one and regret this terrible unreliable piece of trash."
2,"Beware of this ""mouse""","I changed my wired USB Intellimouse Explorer with this one.Read this: If you are going to use this mouse for Web Development and/or Gaming, better buy another mouse, not wireless.* I had troubles to get it work because of syncronization* The wheel is not too soft... it it the harder wheel I have ever touched!* Side buttons are for X-treme Large Fingers (F**k), Why 5 buttons if you can't touch them?* THIS MOUSE IS *** HEAVY ***, come on we are on 21th Century!* After all of this, the price is really high because of being platinum. there are other wireless microsoft mouses half the price.The only pro of this mouse is the really new style and its ergonomy (Right handed only)."
4,Caution left-handed users,"This mouse is not so ergonomic for left handed users. The two ""thumb"" buttons are not on the thumb side for lefties and the shape of the mouse is not as comfortable. If you are right-handed the mouse is nice."
5,Midnight Madness Rocks!,Midnight Madness has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remember! Who could forget Heart and Soul at the piano museum or 'Fagabeefe'? The sea is reversed. S.S. itari is mixed up and blind.
4,A Classic,"It is an awesome movie,it's old,but to me it's classic,Michael J.Fox,is soo young in it,to people they wouldn't know it's him compared to other movies that he did.The other stars did a great job also.I love that college students did a race,and they are put into groups.That's it."
2,Midnight Madness,"Overall a poor movie. It is worth it to see Michael J. Fox in his first movie. I got a chuckle or two from Eddie Deezen (the greatest movie nerd, hands down). And look for a camio from Pee-Wee Herman (yes, he keeps his pants up)."
3,it's out there,"quite an interesting read. Somewhat repetitive and lacking in hard data, but generally well researched and argued stories, which does leave one wanting more."
1,not about history,"This book is more about the authers, geolegist and other people than history itself. not to pleased with this guy."
2,"good art, thats it","The story is hard to follow and i didnt really understand what the hell was going on. I read this book halfway before putting it down and deciding to return it because it was so bad. Instantly regret buying this book. The book is in full color, but even that cant save a lazy effort and what is possibly one of the worst manga I have set my eyes upon."
1,Katsuya Terada Monkey King,"I was really disappointed with this book. I've been looking for a graphic representation of Monkey King for some time but this was stereotyping, sexist , and very difficult to find and follow any kind of plot."
5,Great book,"I've just got into Star Trek and decided to read some of the books the cast wrote. The first book I read was Walter's book. He told some hilarious stories, but yet he told about the serious stuff too.I've heard that some, if not all of the cast had issues with William Shatner. Walter could've made this a dirt book and tell about every dirty thing Shatner ever did to him. Walter didn't do that. He let it be known that he wasn't happy with some of the things Shatner did it on the set, but the whole book wasn't about that. I've read other books where stars and costars just let out all the bad feelings and the book turns out negative because it turns into 'I hate him because he did this and that, this and that, this and that- etc' I repeat that Walter's book ISN'T like that. It's worth a read if you are a Star Trek fan."
5,Rawr!,"My preschooler, kindergartner, and grade school-er all love when I bring these down. They play naturally (sans coaching or prompting) with them at each of their own development levels: Colors, type sorting, counting, adding and subtracting, and grouping/ dividing them between each other. Play with these lasts them at least 30 minutes and they pick up nicely back into the tub. I expect these will last us many years and pass on to share with nieces and nephews too."
5,GREAT so far,"I have only read 60 or so pages so far, but as other readers have accounted, I have a difficult time putting the book down.It reads like a hollywood movie, I have to snap myself to attention every-so-often to remind myslef that these accounts are true to life, that these things actually HAPPENED, which makes it even more gripping. The way the author goes from the experiences of the ghost soldiers and the prisoners on the death march is perfectly mixed.Nicely Done.Well, I finished the book a while back, and, in conclusion I repeat what I've said before...Nicely Done, Nicely done indeed."
5,Ghost Soldiers,Should be required reading for history classes lest we forget the horrible reality of war and why freedom requires the maintenance of a powerfull military capability. Dependance on the the civility of mankind is the certain road to enslavement
3,Good effort,"I knew little of our Pacific POW history. I read Dickey's Special Prisoner, but most history glosses over US POW treatment in WWII.The book is interesting and informative, and I'm glad it was written.However, I would have given 4 stars but found Sides writing a bit weak. I felt that he struggled between ""reporting"" what happened and trying to tell a good story. He's not a natural storyteller.The other weakness is of no fault of Sides: nothing really dramatic happens, which means, thankfully, the mission was very sucessful, but unfortunately lends itself to a uneventful read."
5,An excellent historical review!,"This is a great review of a fascinating WWII exploit about the secret recovery of American prisoners in the Phillipines. As an added bonus, it also gives an excellent and realistic review of the Bataan Death March. I had never heard of this secret mission before, so this story was extremely interesting. This is a wonderful read for people interested in wartime history. Hampton Sides did some marvelous research, and writes with the skill of an accomplished novelist."
5,Ghost Soldiers - A Courageous Undertaking,"Hampton Sides' careful research had yielded a true persepctive of the WWII Japanese military's barbaric mentality - coupled with a courageous resuce mission by specially selected Rangers. The author draws vivid accounts of the action involved and personalities of the three entities: Japanese oppressors, the prisoners themselves, and the rescue team. It is a book I'd highly recommend for those seeking a true perspective of WWII uncluttered by historic revisionism. This is from a WWII infantry veteran of the Philippine campaign and 16-year editor of the 33rd Infantry Division newsletter."
5,RIVETING audio book,"I listened to this book on tape while driving across country, and I didn't even notice the hours or the miles flying by because this book was SO good. I didn't have to stop and stretch or use the rest areas. You can read the other reviews for the contents of the book itself, but if you are looking for a book on tape to listen to - I HIGHLY recommend Ghost Soldiers. It's a well-written book and it's very well read on the tape. My only caution would be to have some kleenex handy for the end of the book. After I listened to the book on tape, I took a look at the hardcover book in the store just to see the pictures and the maps, but I was able to follow everything in the story without them."
4,A very good WWII story.........,"Ghost Soldiers presents a thrilling account of the rescue of POW's from a Japanese prisoner camp in the Phillipines of WWII. The book is fast-paced and relatively brief providing an excellent weekend's read. Hampton Sides does an admirable job introducing the characters and then weaving them into the narrative. Alternating chapters between the daring rescue effort and the desperate, diabolical experience of life at the camp helps build to a highly suspenseful conclusion.Ghost Soldiers certainly captures the reader, electrifying an empathy which has one cheering the rescuers efforts and silently exhorting the prisoners to hold on. These POWS suffered not only the Bataan Death March, but years of imprisonment afterwards. Their rescue was pure and utter heroism as was their indomitable determination to survive.I recommend the book highly for its' pace, suspense, and level of devotion to the courageous men and women of WWII."
4,Smply Outstanding,"Hampton Sides has written a remarkable story that conveys the essence of human nature, spirit, and sheer will to rise over adversity, in a self sacrificing manner. The historical data is wonderfully crafted into a novel, of sorts, that makes for a rather compelling read. The plot weaves multiple storylines together to create an impressive book that portrays the reality of the American spirit. The reader discovers new realms that are scarcely seen by a civilian that brings pride and honor to veterans alike. Once you become entangled in Sides craftsmanship, you relive this great story full of emotions and peril. Sides has found his calling and allows the reader to ride on an emotional roller coaster that ends where the road to freedom begins. History buffs and avid readers wil both find this an enjoyable read. Ghost Soldiers is an incredible book and a even more wonderful story. A must read."
2,"Ghost Soldiers, an enthralling account.","Excellent book, excellently written. I felt like I was there with the Rangers and with the prisoners. Very descriptive."
1,Poorly designed product: oil leaks out,"As some other reviewers have noted, the oil cartridge leaks. A lot. Not once you plug it in (then it works fine). But on its way to you. And when you're opening it. Or handling it. Or, really, doing anything with it. Mine arrived half-empty and got all over the floor, all over me, and all over my sweatshirt.I don't yet know if it works, but based purely on its leakiness I will never order it again. And, just for the record, the fault is not with Amazon's packaging; it's with the product design of the oil cartridge itself."
1,gee,"I read about alain delon, he said about himself, ""a pretty boy with beautiful face"". I was watching this movie and I have a 20/10 vision and I still couldn't figure out, why he said that, his little face with little piggy eyes. The only thing that is really going for him is his shoes. All his movies, how do I put it softly, [I do not like]. He don't even understand what he is doing in the movie as long as camera is rolling, again Alain Delon said that he feels miserable when camera stops rolling and director screams cut, I think he said that because he is afraid that one day director will say cut and you fired, get this untalanted [guy] out, I'll have a better luck doing serious movie with Robin Williams."
5,The Blue Anywhere,"After having had my computer system compromised, I am reading this novel for the second time. The first time I read it was before this had happened and I didn't pay much attention to the computer hacking parts of the story. This time I am. It is amazing just how some very talented individuals can use their superior intelligence to hack into systems anywhere at anytime. This is why I entitled my review of The Blue Nowhere as The Blue Anywhere. I would much prefer they used their intelligence to do some good in society. Since this is not the case though, we need to be well aware of their damaging potential."
1,Terrible,"If you eat sleep and dream of computers this may be OK for you, but if you are just an average user, this book is BAD. It is ALL about computers and hacking. The author did a lot of research and then strung it all together in a half way decent plot, but the computer ""action"" just drags it down. Don't waste your time."
2,Deaver is suffering from popularity,"Deaver seems to be dumbing down with each new book. I absolutely loved A Maiden's Grave, and The Bone Collector, but have been losing interest ever since, and I couldn't stand The Blue Nowhere. The biggest problem is that he spends the whole book lecturing about software, he sounds like he's trying to impress people with what he's learned, but I'm sorry, I've been a software engineer for 20 years and Deaver's been taken in by a lot of hype. Even so, I might have been ok with all that, if the book itself was any good. I guess I'm getting sick of books about super-smart psycho killers, its just not believable. The one in this book decides to kill a 15 year old boy just because he's a good programmer and therefore might be competition to him some day, yeah right."
3,"Entertaining, but . . .","I found Deaver's The Blue Nowhere to be a enthralling story with good characters and a strong plot. But, as a computer professional, I had a hard time with many of his ""facts"" about computers, especially mainframes. I've never seen or heard a computer room referred to as a ""dinosaur room"", although I'm sure some people, somewhere do so. Mainframe cables don't spring to life and injure folks, and air plenums (raised floors) don't typically co-exist with air ducts. Also, he uses the term stenanography (which my dictionaries don't define) where I believe he means steganography. Worth a read even with these and other similar distractors."
1,Total Waste of Time,"Now I remember why I quit reading Jeffery Deaver. In my opinion, this book was not a mystery, but a boring dissertation on computers. I read it because it was so highly recommended but could hardly wait until I was finally finished. Too predictable for me."
5,AWESOME!,"If you love technology & a good crime novel, this is the book you have been waiting for. This was the very first book of Deaver's I read, I went back & read the rest of them.A truly awesome book!"
4,Happy not to see Lincoln Rhyme again,"Fast paced story that I could not put down. My guess is that if you a computer tech whiz, there are probablly a lot of implausibilities in this story; but if you're not and you can handle all the acronyms and are somewhat into computers, you'll like it. The main character, Wyatt Gillette (a hacker)is released from prison temporarily to help find another hacker who is murdering people based on a computer game. Lots of surprises and twists. Bring back Wyatt Gillette"
3,Not as good as his Lincoln Rhyme books!,"I enjoyed this book, it even scared me a little, but doesn't compare to Bone Collector or Empty Chair. I'm not too computer literate, so alot of the technical ""stuff"" only confused me, although the characters did a pretty good job of explaining. I would buy his next novel, though, hoping it's as good as some of his earlier work."
2,Not very believable,"Does Jeff Deaver really expect anyone to believe that a hacker can build a computer out of wood and scraps of wire while locked in solitary confinement? To make matters worse, he has a cop look into the jumbled box of wires and determine at first glance that the homemade PC contained a modem? It's just too far-fetched. I've read almost all of the other Deaver novels and the only ones worth reading were the Lincoln Rhyme novels."
1,cheesy beefcake,"All in all, a low budget production with weak acting. I remember having such hopes for this film when it premiered and spent my time in the theater trying not to laugh at the dramatic moments. Even today, my partner and I dissolve into uncontrollable giggles by quoting the classic line at the climax of the film:""I'm the awesome one; you're the loser!""Rent this somewhere if you're curious, but spend your money on something else worthy of having in your gay dvd library."
1,All The Rage - dvd,Very disappointing. Advertising and reviews led me to believe it would be fantastic. Would not recommend buying.
4,Very thoughtful and interesting read,"Cheryl Reed's curiosity about nuns and women's Catholic religious orders inspired her to interview a wide variety of religious women across the U.S. The result is a fascinating look into the spirituality, community, politics, and purpose of the contemporary Catholic sisterhood. This is the type of book I love -- Reed interviews such a breadth of women, from those who are very traditional to very progressive, and tries to understand what inspires these women, and how they deal with the difficulties of their chosen lifestyle. Reed also asks the bigger question of can religious women be relevant in today's world. She comes up with some insightful ideas on how the women's monastic community has changed and continues to change to meet both individual spiritual needs as well as the needs of the broader community."
2,"Won't connect, Flimsy tilt, Short battery life,","Don't get this product! I returned one already.1. Won't connectMouse didn't work out box. Had to return to get another one. What a hassle. I wonder how long this mouse will last.2. Flimsy tiltWhat a lousy and flimsy design... How often does one use side scroll anyway? In any case, to use it takes large amount of finger extension and force. Lousy gimmick at best. And I miss the scroll with ""click"" as smooth scroll doesn't feel ""right"".3. 6 month battery life?Now that's a LIE! The damn Intellipoint software keeps on reminding me after 2 months that I need to change the battery and I used it only at home. I wish I got the Logi with built-in charger.Finally, I wish I bought the Logi with 600 dpi and recharger instead. I tried one and regret this terrible unreliable piece of trash."
5,Great Workout Mat,"Pros:*Durable*Good Padding*Excellent build qualityCons:The only thing I didn't really like was that this mat folds in two. I would have preferred a 3-way fold to provide better storage, but this is a minor concern ."
2,Not good as a sleeping pad,"Purchased this product hoping it would be thick and soft enough to provide comfort as a sleeping mat. Neither thick nor soft. Probably good as a workout mat, but no good for sleeping."
4,Nice and soft,Nice product. I rated it a '4' because it is bulky in storage. It folds into 2 for storage at 36 inches by 24 inches otherwise it performs at a '5'.
4,Nice mat for the price,"Great price, but once I received it and started using it the price made sense since I found this mat to be ok. It does not have the firmness that you will find with mats in professional gyms. It's durable but quite soft (I now totally get the reviewer who stated this is great used as a sleeping mat). Ok for most routines like crunches but anything that has you putting your weight on a body point like a knee, hand or elbow you can expect to feel through to the floor."
4,Good construction---probably slightly toxic,"The mat isn't, as the photo appears to me, some kind of slick fabric. It's like a vinyl. When the mat arrived, it even was slightly sticky, not slick, and it was odorous. It took some weeks for the odor to clear.Functionally, the mat is really good (and great at the price I myself paid: $39.95 with Free Super Saver shipping). It's not thick enough to cushion beyond moderate impact. I'd hesitate, if standing, to drop straight onto my knees on it. Yet it's ample to cushion one's body already near or on it, what I bought the mat for in the first place. In that capacity its slight softness is a virtue.The mat also comes in very handy for the friend who happens to sleep over on the floor.It tends to attract dust, but, yes, it is easy to wipe clean."
4,just what i need,This is actually my second purchase of the same item. Really good exercise mat and it is good enough to use it as guest for sleep over.
2,The tear very easily,"I own a boxing gym. The prior ab mats lasted me for approx 3+ years. I wish I could recall the name brand they were. These Everlast Mats, I ordered 4 of them, all 4 ripped the very first week. They were not abused, just simply sliding up against the wall to put them away, or if anyone scooted on them, they tore that way too. Very strange.It's a shame, because I really like how thick they are. Just to darn paper thin!!!"
5,Amazing mat for the price,"This mat is a great buy. It is firm but comfortable, looks very well made, and has not compressed after months of use. I liked it so much I bought another one so that I could do stretch during lunch at the office."
5,As described,"Unlike some other mats I looked at in stores, this one is thick enough to comfortably perform sit-ups. Just getting started with it, but it looks like it will hold its shape."
5,Laid Back Futurism,"I picked this title up because I am familar with some of the artsists featured on the disk and a huge Detroit techno head in general. Very pleased. This disk is eclectic in style and offerings, even challenging to what you may consider ""techno"". Beautifully produced with it's own unique groove. If you are a fan of Detroit techno and some of it's deeper mutations, this is what you are looking for."
3,CD does not help Sumi Jo,"Due to a strong recording contract, Sumi Jo is one of the more established coloratura singers in the circuit today. I have most of the CDs for classical voice...but this one, I sold to a used CD store.Ms. Jo tackles the repertoire in this CD with solid technique. Yet the repertoire itself falls short of commanding movement of heart. Much of it may be the hesitation with phrasing. Ms. Jo seemed unprepared and not thoughtful in her musical direction. In short, this is a great CD to give a young student a quick ""snapshot"" of repertoire. However, the performance is not great and I wouldn't buy it as a gift for a music-lover."
3,Not my favorite,I have read every book written by Mary Higgins Clark.... This is the first one that I put down and picked up months later. I found it slow at times and the ending not up to Clark's caliper.
4,AN ENJOYABLE SUMMER READ,"I look forward to MHC's novels with great anticipation! Her main character Emily is like many of those in her past books, a young successful career woman with time to investigate a murder. I liked the reincarnation twist, but I am partial to her stories set in Manhattan. This one had many twists, and kept me guessing about who the killer/stalker was. It wasn't my favorite of her books, but well worth the time. An enjoyable summer read!"
3,Audio hard to follow,"I listened to the audio version of this book. I HATED the narrator. Her voice was so monotone and dull that I wasn't able to follow the story. I'm not even sure I know what happened in the book. I don't want to be overly critical of the book since I need to re-read it, but I don't advise getting the audio version."
2,Not one of MHC's Better Books,"I thought this book had too many characters, so it became difficult to keep track off all of them. Many of her characters are also very generic and not very interesting. I don't think she did a very good job with exploring recarnation, I think she could have done a much better job with the topic. I definently don't recommend buying this book. Many of her early novels are a lot better."
4,A Thrilling Book,"This book had a lot of suspense and will keep the reader guessing until the end. Although the book did contain alot of characters, which could be confusing, I enjoyed the book very much. The only problem was the ending. I felt that the book ended rather abruptly and the author didn't wrap up all of the loose ends. I closed the book feeling that I needed more insight on the main characters feelings and actions at the end. I do, however, recommend this book to anyone that enjoys Mary Higgins Clark."
3,"Good, Light mystery...","Like most Mary Higgins Clark books, this one is a good, fast read and a good mystery. I thought I had the crime figured out and then changed my mind about 4 times, not knowing until the end which of my theories was correct. The main character, Emily changes jobs, sells some stock and moves to a quaint New Jersey seaside town where her ancestors had lived 100 years ago. A series of recent crimes has policed baffeld, and the town in a panic. The most eerie aspect of the crimes is their link and similarity to a series of crimes that took place 100 years ago involving one of Emily's ancestors and several other young women in the town at that time. There are a couple of side plots to keep you going as well. I would say this is one of her better books with a more involved plot than most.Clark is always a good standby!"
4,"OK, but not the greatest read","This book was pretty entertaining, but I didn't really like all the reincarnation stuff. It seemed to get old because she talked about it so much... But it was pretty fast paced and kept me guessing until the end. I read it in a couple days, if that says anything. I think some of her other books were better. But if you are a loyal Clark fan, you will probably enjoy it despite the ""little"" things...."
2,An Inferior Work by MHC,"Mary Higgins Clark is really coasting with this book. It is a huge disappointment. Her characters are formuliac and poorly developed. As a big fan of hers, I find it a shame she's putting out such poor work. Next time I'll read the ratings first."
2,Big disappointment,"While usually predictable, Mary Higgins Clark's books are a fast, enjoyable read. This story re: reincarnation was slow moving, predictable and a huge disappointment. Hopefully, this is just an aberration and I look forward to her next book."
1,Hard to follow ** uninteresting plot ** Too many characters,"I've been listening to the audio book by MHC of this title. I cannot finish it because it is too hard to follow. There are too many characters that are not interesting enough for me to even remember their names, and the plot has already sunk for me. Thumbs Down!"
3,A Good Sart,"All of the books in this series are nearly the same which can be a bit annoying. However, I view any weight-training programs offered as just a start rather than as the end all of what to do."
3,Value of the book,"I thought that this book would have been more robust, the exercises in the book are good, just nothing ground breaking. May want to save your dollar if you are an experienced martial artist!"
1,Do Not Go With Microsoft,"I was extremely disappointed. The software is designed to disable the touchpad on my laptop. Microsoft support (as always) is the worst in the industry. Even if you have to spend a little more, buy a different brand if you are looking for a wireless mouse!"
1,Very Upset With Doll,"I bought this doll the day it was released for the $249. because I was going out of the country for two weeks and I thought that when I got back she would be sold out. When I got home and opened the box, she had been opened I was very upset. Then when I got online to return her I found out that they had a special on her I got even more upset. I was going to just exchange her but I changed my mind when I found out that canada was selling her for $34, and they would not ship the the U.S. I my opinion she is worth the $249 but not if she is open before I even get her, and it is not right that people from a different country can buy her cheaper and we have to pay so much more or have to buy last years leftovers to get her. This was the fist time I ever bought anything from toys r us and amazon.com, and beleive me it will be the LAST TIME I ever buy form them again."
1,What a rip off!,When I saw the price for this barbie I couldn't believe it! For 249 dollars you could buy the Queen Elizabeth Barbie or a better platinum doll! This one isn't even close to their level of beauty! The special promotion where you buy 100.00 dollars worth of barbies to get this one for 34.99 is also riduclous. All of those are old dolls that most people already have. YOU COULD HAVE AT LEAST LET THE NEW DOLLS BE PART OF THE PROMOTION! I would've bought this if the new dolls were a part of this. This is an outrage!
3,"Nice, but..............................","I am happy to have this doll added to my other three flavor obsession dolls, however I am also happy that I didn't pay the original price for her. I needed the other dolls that I bought with the special and the $34.95 was an added bonus, but I wouldn't have paid the original price. She isn't any different than the other three in quality."
3,Quite hard to read.,"This is a photographic reproduction, I think, of a very early book. You would have to be very very keen to plough through it.That being said, you can dive into it and look up bits and find amazingly interesting this and that.I bought it but I hardly ever consult it.For most people, though, I think they would be disappointed. You could try Phelps' more modern work on a similar subject (though the gremlins got at him via the design and typesetting process)."
4,Very happy with this purchase.,"THis was failry easy and quickd to put together.It is very lightweight, so easy to move around.Not overly huge, so could be small for older kids to play soccer with.Perfect size for street hockey, which was our intended purchase.I am giving 4 stars because I ama bit worried about how durable it will be with boys rough housing.Mine will regularly be use with a decent sized group of boys aged 9-11 for roller street hockey.It is basically PVC pipes with a net, looks great with the sleeves/"
5,birthday gift,Game arrived on time and as described. It is a fun game for my six year old grandaughter who found it easy to play.Great game for this age group.
3,Very cute game..,Bought this game for my seven yr. old daughter. she has many build a bear stuffed animals. thought this would be a fun addition. The game takes you from the process of picking out the animal you want to stuffing it to picking out clothes. then you can take it on some adventures. the only flaw is that there is only a few animals to choose from. but all in all is a good game for the cheap price i paid.
2,Night of the Jackal: Not a good sequel at all,"The second book of the North Star series pales in comparison to the first. Maybe all the violence just got too old.I really wouldn't recommend this title even if you enjoyed the first issue.I don't know if the other books in this series is enjoyable like the first one. So if you have to get another one, skip over this one..."
5,"Great ideas, nice guide to what area you are improving","There are so many activities that I would never have thought of. Some are obvious and what every parent does but many are simple, use household objects, are fun and are new to us. I like having activities that don't require the latest and greatest toy. Would you think of using a paper towel roll and scarf to make a game? My son squeals at this and wants to pull the scarf. I also like that it lists what skills are being reinforced with each activity. My son needs more work on his upper body strength so I just flip through pages and stop on the activities that focus on this.We go to playgroups, My Gym, Mommy and Me and this book gave us plenty of new ideas of little activites that make our day so much more interesting. It's a big hit with Daddy too since he is often at a loss for what to play with a six month old."
3,we use it sometimes,"I bought this book used so it was worth the money. It's full of idea to entertain babies of all ages. We have gotten a few ideas from this that we wouldn't have thought of otherwise, that our baby has really enjoyed. But most of these we haven't used and will never use. It is becoming more useful as he gets older, though, so I think we'll be using it more and more."
3,Ok book,"My daughter is only 14 mos, so I have to admit, this review is based on the first part of the book. The best thing about this book is that I learned some new songs and accompanying singing activities that my daughter seems to really enjoy. The regular activities are pretty basic and you are probably already doing a lot of them. For instance, stacking, looking in the mirror and pointing out body parts, and playing with bubbles! I'm glad I bought it used :)"
2,Its not that great,"I was expecting more interesting and fun games that I hadn't already thought of myself. This is really simple play that most parents do already like hold your baby, rock your baby, look at your baby. Seriously! I had this covered and wanted more from this book."
5,"buy it , you'll love it !",extraordinary music !i lent this cd to my violin teacher & he was entralled.he said it was the best version of this piece he had ever listened to.
4,perfect for busy people,"This is an excellent way to start learning Russian, even if you don't spend that much time in your car. I'd give it 5 stars if they included a little information on grammar and corrected the mistakes on the alphabet page (they printed not using a Cyrillic font, the letters are totally incorrect!) Even still, I'm looking forward to buying the second level once I master the material in this course."
1,Very basic,There really isn't anything special or unique about this book. I hate to say that I didn't like it because I really like Jay Wiseman's SM101.
1,Don't buy for the Kindle,Hi folks--My low score is strictly due to the problems with formatting for the Kindle edition. It's essentially unreadable on the Kindle - each tip is in a microscopic font that can not be enlarged. You really need a magnifying glass to read the print.
1,"The absolute worst book, ever.","Generation X by Douglas Coupland, man, is absolutely the lamest book in the absoluete lamest genre of literature there is. There is nothing more annoying than books about whiny rich kids who are ""searching"" for their role in their generation, ""trying to find themselves."" The people who like this book are the same people who find art in music videos, who work at Blockbuster ""but really want to direct,"" and find great social significance in things like The Breakfast Club. Coupland is an absolute TERRIBLE writer, who apparantly has only read The Cathcer in the Rye and Less Than Zero.Everything I've read by the man is even worse than this."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,"TO SUGGEST THIS BOOK IS A BLEAK CRITICISM OF THE ""20 SOMETHINGS"" IS COMPLETELY MISGUIDED. tHIS BOOK IS A POIGNANT LOOK AT COMING OF AGE OVER EDUCATED AND UNDERMOTIVATED. gEN X IS A GREAT READ--FUNNY AND TRAGIC. fOR ANY ONE LOOKING FOR KEROUAC LIGHT THIS IS THE BOOK. NOT TO MENTION THAT THERE IS GREAT COMMENTARY AND ""DICTIONARY"" IN THE MARGINS. TO TRULY ENJOY THIS BOOK DON'T GO INTO IT EXPECTING REVELATION--IT'S SIMPLY AN ENTERTAINING LOOK AT LIFE THE WAY MANY OF US VIEW IT"
4,Knee-jerk Irony Defined Here,"I read this book in the year 2000, ten years too late. (I was busy exploring the Internet in 1990.) This title is not a ""must-read"", rather a ""must-have-read"". It is part of the next Western Canon, as are some other works by the same author. Get them now, skim through on a rainy day."
1,Not necessarily representative,"Although I'm a ""Gen-Xer,"" I don't see myself in thisbook, and I would be willing to wager that most of my friends wouldagree with that assesment. Douglas Coupland often paints ""my generation"" with too broad a brush, no matter if the ""paint"" is positive or negative. There are many other generational studies out there that are better written and more representative of reality than Coupland's portrayal of ""us."" Unfortunately, this is the one the media latched onto. END"
4,"It will touch, it will move you--but only if you're 20+","My parents wouldn't get this. My uncles and aunts wouldn't get this. My boss wouldn't understand this book. But my officemates and friends (alll in their twenties) surely get this book. They laughed, they got sad, they got scared. The book talked to a certain audience, and me presumably being one of them, was moved by the accuracy of the details he uses. The brand names. The company names. They evoke not just the literal image of the objects/entities, but the feelings, the emotions, the texture of the age that we are in right now. Definitely not for everyone, but definitely for my generation."
2,Doesn't do it for me,"This is not a very deep album and it doesn't make a point. It is vague and shallow, so I will not take long. It borders somewhere in between Soul and Hip-Hop. A mutt of the two but doesn't seem to have the good parts of either of them. These are 3 of the best on the West Coast, but each of them seemed to put only 1/3 of their regular efforts, which makes this a collabaration that really did not hold up to the hype that alot of fans gave it. These three need each other to be good, but none of them sound to good together. Something went wrong with this album, because these are three West Coast giants that got on this album and played it small here."
5,Long time T'ai Chi student,A wonderful little book of thoughts and peoms to go with T'ai Chi. It's title is extremely apt. I would recommend it to all who love T'ai Chi
2,Disappointed,"I bought this mouse because of its physical look (very attractive) and the advertised 3x longer battery life. In the end, I decided not to keep it. The shape and size of the mouse make it so uncomfortable to hold; my wrist and my hand hurt so much after a day of use. I thought that it needs a little time to get used to, but after a few days, I simply gave up. Therefore, before deciding on this mouse, make sure you try it first as it may not be for everyone.UPDATE: I have tried some other mice like the Logitech Cordless Click! Plus and the MX700. I didn't like the way they fit in my hand either because of the rather weird shapes. In the end, I am settled with the Logitech 2x wireless mouse. It does not have two extra buttons like the others but is so comfortable to the hand. I just love the mouse. Sometimes, less means more (the mouse is only $29.95 MSRP)..."
3,"It was OK looking, not anywhere near the best mouse available these days.","I owned and used this mouse for about five years. The ""leather"" look of it, I thought, was quite classy. Much nicer looking than the equivalent mouse without the leather trim.It was an OK mouse, I suppose. It didn't do so well when I tried using it on top of one of those crystal clear desk protectors.I now have theLogitech MX 1100 Cordless Laser Mouseand I like it a lot better. It glides easier, the clicking is a more gentle in nature, the double-clicking is more precise, and it has a number of superior buttons/features built directly into the mouse."
1,At First I Was Nearly Convinced Until I Got To Page 150,"This review is short and sweet. I read the book with great interest and was happy to take as probably genuine the accounts of strange phenomenon and the ability of some people to perform miracles or super-human feats. That is until I reached page 150. There I read about Sathya Sai Baba. He has an enormous following and is said to perform miracles and conjure gifts out of thin air for his admiring followers. This I found just a story too far. A brief amount of investigation plus a look at some of the videos on YouTube was enough to convince me the man is a sleight of hand stage magician. If Michael Talbot can be conned into writing about such people with obvious reverence an awe it doesn't say much for the rest of the so called ""facts"" in this book. I shall persevere to the end of the book as I have paid out good money but to say I'm disappointed is an understatement."
1,Just bad,"I have an open mind. I am open to a great many ideas, and embrace the evolving paradigm of our reality. With regret I feel compelled to relay that a moment taken to investigate the authors bibliography will shoot holes straight through this book. It is unfortunate, because it is this type of writing that allows strict scientific types to discredit theories that challenge the established ways of thinking.The premise is great. Unfortunately, the tangent of estranged supposed proofs does more harm than good."
1,Not as the title promised,"Really I was very disappointed about this book, I bougt it thinking that it was something that can improve my knowledge about the last ideas on science, but as soon I was progressing in the reading I was very annoyed ,because it is like a propaganda of ideas to be sold to people without no knowledge about the real science. I turn it down before the end."
1,"No good, no science fact","This book is all about psychic experiences. The writer tries to explain them by introducing in the first chapter only, a concept of holography, fetched from physics. This reasoning is far-fetched, certainly not scientific, and is based on fallacy: the writer only picks from here and there ""results from studies"" that support his views. He has no self-criticism and does not mention any arguments against his views. Not scientific, not worth buying. (I bought it thinking I bought a physics book. No so. I read it, then threw it away)."
2,About science but NOT science,"Amalgam of events with little or no critical view.E.g.: a few paragraphs about the ""holy"" man Sai Baba supposed miracles. These have been debunked since as hoaxes and magician tricks. The ""promotion"" of this guru feels ""funny"" in light of the many sexual mollestation charges and suspicious deaths around that guy.Ideas are interesting but that's about it."
2,Read the first 2 chapters...,"...and dump it...great advice given in a previous review.I think the ""shame"" about this book is that it glosses over some very interesting ideas with (in my opinion) some wholly unsupported and mostly un-related crap.Talbot is to the theory of the Holographic Universe what Mark Furman was to the guilt of OJ Simpson. Whatever truth there is to it will be hidden by his presentation of ""false evidence""."
2,Pretentious posturing.,"This might serve as a source for some interested in the current fervor over extending the methods of holography to a very broad range of topics, including the physics of both, perception, and cosmology. As a physicist, with background in psychology, I find both of those projects to be totally unfounded, and pretentious."
2,"No Comment, because product not compatable with Mac","I have no reason to believe that the product is bad, but it's security features were not compatable with Mac."
5,This anime is great!,"I hardly knew anything about Genertor Gawl when I bough it. I remembered seeing a trailor for it on another ADV DVD but I bought it anyways. Surprisingly, this anime was good, Really GOOD. With a nice mix of likes such as comedy and action, it was great. Though the story at first as rough to understand in the beginning, the rest of the elements of this seires, such as the comedy and action, made me forget about that and made me want to see more. The animation is great, and thing music was pretty good too. I suggest this as an anime that any collector or anime fan should have, or at leat see. I think the only downfall is that it only has 3 episodes, but it's still worth it!"
5,scared to death,"In the earlie fifties, I saw this movie and I was scared to death...I have never forgotten this movie over all the years. It has taken hollywood many years to equal this kind of scare. however today it is all too familiar. But one of the best I've ever seen."
5,A very beautiful book of memories and pictures,"This book is just what it says, a book of memories and photo diary. I bought this book for myself because I love Michelle and wanted this beautiful book of memories and pictures of her. And I'm 54 years old. Michelle is a wonderful role model and her books are an inspiration to everyone, including older people and not just little girls. I would reccommend it for anybody of any age."
4,Great review,"I listen to this on my drive to work every day. I like the way it jumps right into the lessons- you hear an English word or phrase followed by the French version. It goes fairly quickly. I believe it could have started out with more basics first- it introduces transportation and currency before teaching you basic numbers. If you already know the basic concepts and pronunciation, this is a great review. As a beginner course, it can be difficult to follow, unless you're reading along or are an excellent auditory learner."
2,Disappointing and returned...,"I had high hopes for this keyboard and the wireless works well. I notice some slight latency if the mouse is at rest. When I have my GPRS phone within 2 feet it interferes terribly.But worst of all is the Intellipoint 5.0 software and the key changes. The new software changes the default mapping for the middle click to ""Alt-tab"". You can restore application specific behavior by setting it back to auto-scroll (the old default). Also, tilt-wheel technology is stupid. However, I really like the new smooth wheel. I wish Logitech would do that.My biggest peeve - WHY move the delete and end keys around?? Why is delete so big???? And why is the left Ctrl key small??? I don't get it. I use End frequently and it should not have been moved. Very poor focus study I guess.Anyway, it was returned. Caveat emptor."
1,Dies very quick,"I have had this setup for a few years now. The keyboard died after one year, but the mouse keeps on working. I have tried it again after a few years and the keyboard worked for 30 minutes, but will not work after the restart. Doing my research on the internet and Microsoft forums it seems that my problem is the norm. The keyboard dies within a year and you get to use the mouse for the rest of the time. On the forums Microsoft simply suggests you try it on a different computer and if the keyboard does not work it's dead. But that still leaves thousands with a bad keyboard after just a short while."
4,"Good desktop combo, limited range.","I am biding my time until Microsoft comes out with an electro-luminescent bluetooth keyboard this coming September, so I purchased this combo used through Amazon Marketplace. I work a lot in dim lighting so I really like the light blue glow of the Saitek and Zippy keyboards.I like the mouse a lot, but the effective range is about 6 feet max. I ended up buying a USB repeating cable to move the receiver closer to where I want to use the mouse, as it had trouble with the signal from my comuter desk (I use it for a HTPC setup).The keyboard seems to have slightly better range. I am not crazy about the key response but that is an individual thing.It is a nice combo if you can get it refurbed or used."
5,just right!,My teanage son wanted something inbetween 9 and 10 and stumbled upon GHS electric guitar boomer set 9 1/2 strings while searching online. These strings turned out to be just right so we've ordered more.
3,Useful but superficial.,"Ram Dass has produced a spirituality industry that caters to the lowest common denominator. I am highly suspicious of the simple path to spiritual enlightenment and practice. That being said, even though I think that this book is generally superficial there are some useful insights in this book."
4,"Powerful, penetrating look at humility and service",The story of the guy who dressed up as a clown to cheer up the kids in the Pediatric Burn Ward was one of the toughest things I've ever read in my life. It seems almost unbelievable to me that such people actually exist. This is an inspiring book.
4,A great way to learn Spanish!,I have learned a lot in just under a week with this series. If you are committed to listening to it every day and going over the included workbook it is great. The only problem that I had with it is that sometimes the narrator is difficult to understand as far as annunciation and volume.
1,Didn't work,I got this as a christmas present for my husband. He went to try it and it won't even turn on. Took me twice talking to reps with the company to mail it back....still waiting on a new one
1,Terrible.,Myself and my friends/family cant stand this thing for anymore that 20 min or so. Definately not worth the money. I got mine from my work and it's in my closet now. Get a normal vibrating pad with heat if you have a sore back at the end of the day.
1,Not Satisfied,"We just opened our shiatsu massage Christmas day and it broke in 10 minutes. I was very unsatisfied with the performance. It did not do what it was supposed to. Every time the motor reached the bottom or the top it shut off. It would not turn on after it shut off the first time. It quit working after 10 minutes and it would not run properly when it did resume power. The unfortunate thing is they only allow 15 minute use at a time, and yes it does fall short of the high and low points of the spine. The other issue is it would improve if you could stop the motors at specific points on your back where you need it the most. I am leary on getting another one after this."
2,Uncomfortable,"I purchased this as a gift for my parents who are in their late 70's. They said it was uncomfortable to sit in and the balls were to hard on their backs. In the last 30 days, they've used this massage cushion only once."
3,Broke,"It worked great for 3 or 4 days and then it got stuck.I unplugged it and plugged it back in and it was still stuck, so I sent back to HoMedics.That was a couple weeks ago and I haven't heard back from them. Hope they don't forget me."
1,Cheap seams,"Had the massager for two months and when using it, the massager head on one side ripped the seam from the top to the bottom."
2,A little rough. I wish the heat would work by itself.,The massager really takes some getting used too. The first couple of times it down right hurt. I applied some towels to add some padding and that helped. The problem with this product is that it is built for one size of back.I probably would not reccomend this product unless you have had the oppurtunity to try it first.
2,a big no no,"we bought this for my mother 2 christmases ago, and it was good for a day and then from then on it was just too painful on the back to use. i do not recommend this product!!"
2,Junk,The first one we received broke after 2 days. The plastic gears inside of it stripped out. The replacement hasn't broke yet but is just not that comfortble. You have to use this device in a perfect chair because using it on a standard recliner or armchair does not align it correctly to your back.
1,Stinky,"I received this for a Christmas present. After opening the package, I could not even use it because the plastic smelled so strongly. According to the other reviews, the massager itself may be good, but the smell is not worth using it."
4,messaging,"using it will let you know what it will do for you, by that i mean somepart of it will be what you expect in accomplishing your back problem, lower ,upper or both.i am satisfied with the product."
3,Duane - NY,"It is a good product. But Amazon mis-advertises it by indicating it has 3 speeds. It has one speed.I email Amazon to tell them that their discription of the product is incorrect. What does Amazon do but send me a second massager that I have to return to them.Why is it that when you email Amazon that you either do not get a reply, or the reply answers a question you did not ask. And you do not get an answer to the question you did ask.Something gets lost in the translation. I am quite certain that the Executives of Amazon, or any other US company that outsources work to India, do not have any Indian secretaries or repectionists."
2,Disappointed,"Although I would agree that this gives quite a vigorous back massage, I was disappointed that after only 5 weeks the shiatsu mechanism malfunctioned. We now have to box it up and send it back for replacement/repair. For the money, I think the quality could have been better."
5,Trance inducing,"I've found this CD to be a wonderful way to induce a trance. I've noticed that I do feel different since using it, lighter and less tense somehow.Yet, I keep falling asleep during it, so I haven't yet (consciously) been able to follow the instructions to make spirit contact.I do have confidence though that it will prove as useful as her Sleep Deeply CD has been to me, once I manage my attention better."
1,i read the reviews,what happen they were a bunch of bull i got nothing out of this disc i followed all the rules and listen several time to make sure i was doing everything right. I hope that when you right a review i am happy that some got something out of it my copy is a in a dumpster some where. A BIG WASTE OF MY TIME.
3,there's a reason these crafts got lost,"i really, really wanted to love this book.I've been a member of craftster since the begining and gotten some awesome ideas from there, and this book got so many positive reviews.But I don't buy craft books to say how fun the projects are.I buy them to *do* the projects.I can't really see some of them (the egg carton lantern???) in anyone's home.There are a few little cute projects (headband, snow globe, book purse) but you can learn how to make them anywhere."
1,Warning,"I advise everyone who likes movies with an actual story line to not watch this movie. This is probably the worst movie I have seen so far. I assume it is made for an older audience, but that doesn't mean it needs to be made so poorly. Cheap music. Bad acting. Not sure why all the other reviews are so high."
3,Motocross Western Style,"Fred Ward and Peter Coyote turn in good performances in this time travel movie. Ward is accidently thrown back to the Old West when riding his motocross bike in a race. He stumbles across a time travel experiament and ends up back in the late 1800s. Coyote wants his bike at any cost and it's a game of cat and mouse for Ward to keep it from him. And if that doesn't get your interest, he has sex with his great great grandmother. Talk about a paradox."
3,Indifferent,"It's not a bad game, but it's not quite what I expected. I was hoping to slaughter and pillage and urinate on things, but it was minimal. A lot of it was solving puzzles and trying to get gremlins to do what you're telling them to do (they used ""idiot minions"" as an excuse to not put much effort into the AI). I guess it's okay. Just don't expect to slaughter and pillage everything in sight. You're still the good guy, they just make it sound mean."
3,"Okay, I guess.","What this game is, is that your a OverLord and are evil. You attack good creators and help or destroy stuff. It is a first person shoot type game, not any really strategy involved. You just got to make sure you remember where stuff is.I did not think it was worth what I paid for it! But, hey, that's just my opinion."
2,"Not great, kids need to really be in the mood",I bought this for my 5-year old daughter who loves litening to my classical music. She did not like it. It failed to grab her attention.
5,Wonderful for reading,Some have commented that Pocket PCs are too small. I like the size for reading. SO much easier to hold than a traditional book. It has not crashed once. Downloading is fine as long as you set both computers to highest baud rate. I could not be more pleased. Anxiously awaiting more titles. Audio books are worthwhile too. Something special about hearing a work read by its author.
2,Horny Dragon,"At first I was enchanted with what I thought was an original story. Modern, shape-shifting dragons hidden in our midst - sounds cool... But as I went along I realized it might as well have been a cheep knockoff of Ann Rice's Interview with the Vampire or any of the numerous stories written in a first person retrospective that has followed. ""Look at me! I am all powerful but I keep having problems with those pesky humans."" Too many foreshadowing hints in the book spoil the several twists and turns thrown at you in the last few chapters. Not to mention the page after page of dragon sex. I wouldn't read it again or recommend others go out of their way to hunt down a copy."
5,The Dragon Delasangre,"This book was great, never have i read anything like this. Yes the main character feed off humans but who cares, this is a book about dragons, and how they deal with living in the world today. anybody who loves a good dragon only book should pick this up."
2,"At first, good, then it became, cow poo!","This show was once a good show. There were many good episodes. I remember watching it a few years ago. I thought it couldn't run for more than a season at first. Then, you know what happened, in 2005. You wanna know what happened. This show (along with Spongebob) went WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYY downhill. CN thought they were gonna stop Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy at season 3 but did they listen? WRONG! they didn't listen. the plots got old, the characters turned from great to stupid, and the animation got worse.1999-2002 were the good ol' days of Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy.2003-2009 of Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy became the ""jumped the shark"" show.All in all, the new episodes were terrible, just go stick with the first 3 seasons of Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy. It was once a good show, but then it became awful."
4,Very good peeler,"Peels effortlessly, only didnt give it a 5 star because I think at a bigger angle the handle would be easier and quicker to use when peeling.. Good price and shipping"
2,French Lessons,"French Lessons did not live up to Mayle's earlier efforts. However, for the travel enthusiast, his vignettes offer pleasant excursions into the French countryside. Truffle hunting, frog leg tastings, and of course a cheese festival, all offer romantic ideas of what France was and, in many respects, continues to be today. Repetition sets in rather quickly in this Mayle travelogue. One has a sense that the second half of the book was destined as filler after having explored a very limited number of interesting festivals presented in the earlier pages. This is most unfortunate. I found myself hurrying through the second half of the book, much like a quick fastfood meal, rather than savoring chapter after chater as one might in a Michelin starred restaurant. However, it is a pleaant way to pass a few hours on the beach or sitting in a chair in the countryside dreaming of one's next trip to France and the true culinary delights that await the avid traveler."
1,"Please, do not buy this translation pen!","This software of the pen is terrible! I grew up with computers and software, but this is just terrible. The pen seems not to have the menues, that the software asks for. I tried hours, even another PC, but I was not able to install the dictinoaries to the pen, because the software could not connect to the pen. I am very angry now, and I had to return the pen. I am now looking for a pen from another brand.I had read the other comments before, about the bad software, but I thougt, I can handle that - I could not!"
3,SuperPen,"When it comes to scanning text, the pen works like a dream. The angle is a bit funny, but you get used to it. The software however, is another story. The pen came with a Spanish dictionary pre-installed (I suppose, addressed to the US market, where ""the"" foreign language is Spanish). Tried to load the German dictionary, no chance. I checked the manual, went to the Internet, tried to load it from the CD, but, no. So, for the time being, only used as a good line scanner."
5,A story of love and passion at its best,"I loved every moment reading the story of Mairey and Jack, two very passionate individuals who clearly and beautifully compliment each other. Ms. Needham's style of writing is not lyrical nor is it very Elizabeth Barrett-Browning; nonetheless, I enjoyed the down-to-earth exchange of anger, passion, love and laughter among the characters. I would certainly keep this book and read it all over again, and I can't wait to read Ms. Needham's other works as well."
2,Against the grain once again...,"Sorry everybody, I'm gonna go against the grain on this one. I really tried to get into the story but if the point of this site is be honest than...every page of this one became a chore just to get through...The only thing that stood out about ""The Wedding Night"" was this...""...'Not tonight Jack. You need to rest.' He waggled a finger at her, nearly cross-eyed with the effort. 'There's none for the wicked, my dear'""...And the first thing that came to mind was...hmmmm I wonder if Kresley Cole read this right before she titled her book ""No Rest for the Wicked""....LoL! That really is the kind of stuff I think about and I'm women enough to admit...it's exhausting!!!"
1,Unbelievably Bad!,"This has got to be the worst movie of it's type (big budget, big stars) I have ever seen. A complete [distruction] of Terry Southern's hilarious 60's novel, it captures not one of the laughs, not one of his comical characters and none of his satirical wit. The movie was deservedly savaged by critics and avoided by moviegoers. The best excuse I can find for it is that it was made during a time of many studio restrictions. and could be a truly funny independent film today."
5,Great blast from the Past,As students 34 yrs ago we raved over this film. I haven't seen it since until I found it recently by accident at Amazon. What a surprise!It maintains all the amusement and freshness of a genre that is seldom executed so well in more recent times. To see some of the great actors in their youth again was a real treat.Scandinavian girls were all the rage in the UK in the 60's and no wonder!!!
4,Best TV under $500,"This TV has a great picture tube for a non-flat TV. I looked at several 32 and 35 inch TV's, and know one had the same clarity and sharp contrast of the Sony Triniton line. This TV doesn't have all the monster features that other TV's have, but it has the best two features of any other TV, a great picture and a low price. You can't go wrong with this product; worst case: you put it in your kitchen so that you don't miss the Rams game while you make a sandwich."
2,Disappointing,"The set arrived poorly packaged. The product box was damaged and the salad bowl and servers had numerous scratches. Salad set was intended to be a wedding gift, but was not presentable and I returned."
4,Worth the read.,"Never read anything by this author before, thought I'd give it a try. Well worth it, as it turned out to be a sound crime book. With enough pace and action to keep me interested."
2,Part order,"The part I order was to have ,(VGA Y cable) 15pin on the male end, only had 14. Send back only to get the same cable"
3,Response to fellow from Maine,"I just bought the A210 and am terribly disappointed in the short term life of the batteries Fuji enclosed in the package. I appreicate your comments on the charger, as I just about ready to order that, thinking it would be best and would avoid the costs of the batteries. I am also finding that my picture frames don't follow suit...they skip backwards 2-4 digits when you take a pic, so you don't have a clue as to where you are. I was a firm believer in Fuji and Fuji films...I am saddened to read y our issues, and a few of my own that I have. The camera overall, seems to take great pics, but what do we do about the short life of batteries, and trying to find a decent charger and power supply cord? I guess we need to go to the Fuji site directly.Some one in Mass."
1,Don't waste your time on Fuji products,"I've ordered not one, not two, but three different cradles from Amazon for my Fuji A210 and I still don't have one that works and includes all the correct parts. The first one didn't work--it charged the batteries for only 15 to 30 minutes which meant that I could only take a few photos before the batteries went dead. I returned it and Amazon sent me a second one but the video cord was missing from the box. Amazon then sent me a third one and it was missing the same cord that was missing from the second box. Since this is the only style cradle I've been able to find that is compatible with this camera, I plan to return the camera, the spare batteries, and the photo card to Amazon for a complete refund and then start all over again with my camera selection. Don't waste your time on Fuji products like I did."
1,CLOSE TO SHORE,THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE AN INTERESTING BOOK SINCE I HAD HEARD IT WAS A TRUE STORY. ACTUALLY IT WAS TERRIBLE - DRAWN OUT AND MORE OF A HISTORY BOOK THAN A NOVEL. VERY DISAPPOINTED.
3,Read it if you are interested,"I liked this book because it had an interesting topic. I did not know about these shark attacks. I thought a lot of the extra added history in the book was boring. The book goes into a lot of detail about some of the characters, the hotels, the coast, the creek, and so on and so on. It made me feel like it was getting off topic. I liked how the author tried to write from the shark's perspective. If you like reading about sharks or strange incidents involving animals and humans then I think this book would be terrific to read.If you are strictly looking for a book to read about facts and shark attacks then this book might not be the book for you.Mostly the book had my attention but I did get frustrated with it since I thought it added too much detail in some cases."
5,Brings the pleasure back to branding,"Hooray for Ragas and Bueno! The first optimistic take on brands I've read in a long time - and certainly the most readable. Cult brands inspire ""intense devotion,"" a concept that goes way beyond brand loyalty. The examples are charming, fun, and unusual (Oprah? WWF? Vans?) and trace specific tactics that add up to an approach to branding that is inclusive versus exclusive, holistice versus segmented, open and friendly. Real insights here for my high tech and dot.com branding clients."
1,50 cent machine ring,I bought this ring for my girlfriend and I was very upset and so was I. I did not pay 46.90 dollars for a ring that I could buy from a 50 cent machine in a burger joint. I expected better material and have it be worth my money. On top of that the ring was not even as described! It was as if it were another ring! It had this dotted designe around the edge and the black areas in the back was not even black it was ALL silver! I'm returning this thing.
3,"OK, but there is better","Not the best, to tell you the truth. They throw a lot at you, and you are expected to understand and repeat. Though this is a low cost item, I find the ""drive-by"" Italian product better, or the Pimsleur conversational Italian - both designed for learning in the car - much better. It's not a bad product, but I believe there are better things out their. Ciao."
5,Excellent course,"Excellent course, especially for people who have a prior knowledge of the Latin languages and for people who spend a lot of time in their cars."
3,Not a terrible program,"Not bad. The translators need to slow down a bit. Overall, pretty good. I would buy again."
3,"Verbose, yet still outshines rivals","Although the topics presented in the first few chapters are presented in a much more elegant fashion in say Kittel and Kroemer, the subsequent discussion of introductory quantum mechanics is excellent, in fact to be preferred over other modern physics texts. An appendix journeys deeper into the mathematics for the interested while the main text maintains a smooth continuity through the various topics covered. At times this book is excessively verbose, particularly in the later chapters from solid state physics to nuclear physics, but the clarity contained in chapters 4-12 compensates for this. I recommend this text for the initiate in quantum mechanics. After working through the first 12 chapters move on to Merzbacher or a text devoted exclusively to the special topics covered."
4,Good Gospel Music,"I bought this album for the title song. It is a good version of the song, but not the greatest I have ever heard. If they had left out the dissertation about their baby boy it would have been better."
2,works by itself,"The program itself installed fine, but I need to print envelopes, wich some genuis did not program in, I use the other programs, but was forced to uninstall the works and go back to my older version. If you need spread sheets and the like it is fine but keep your old works it is much better."
5,nice bundle for the general family use or student,"Most people that write need Word - Microsoft's Word Processing Program. It is also found in Office - but many times the average family user does not need Powerpoint or Excel, but want general programs such as Money, Street Finder, an advanced Paint-photo publishing program and Word!! Picture It is Microsoft's publishing photo program and usually cost around $60. You get that Word, Money, Street Finder, and Encarta! All for a price coasting 1/3 or less of Office. This is amazing and just perfect for family use or student use.So if you need Word but gulp at the price of Office this is a very good alternative!Picture-it is a nifty program that does many of the same things Javc's PSP does, but in a for much easier for the casual learner to pick up. It has many create your own templates, such as cards and letter heads. The photo handling and effect are super.So this is work every penny."
5,Great home product!,"I love this bundle! I have worked with MS Publisher, Excel, Quicken, and Access and this does all those things for a LOT less. Works is definately the workhorse here, but I absolutely love the Money program. I am amazed at how detailed I can get with my money planning. As a PTA stay at home mom I use every program in here to do school projects, and Picture it! is so easy with my digital camera. Encarta's encyclopedia will be great for my son's homework, and I'm already planning trips with the Streets program. I couldn't be happier and so far I haven't had one error or problem"
2,OH GOD THE SMILES,"Why is everyone is always smiling in this book?! As far as the art goes, when a character is supposed to be pissed or sad it looks like they are trying to hide a smile as if about to burst out into laughter.Anyway...the only interesting thing in this book is Captain America."
3,Too much on her life,"I must say I am not enjoying this book as much as I thought. As someone who dreams, I though this book would help me with my gift. The book focused too much on the writer's experience but didn't turn it around to interest me (the reader). I haven't even finished the book. It's just too many stories. It does not have enough applications or help. I thought it would say more about God and His ways or direction. I was disappointed in this book. It wasn't for me."
2,Does not understand why Whites are Supreme!,"White America needs to find an author who has the courage to write the truth. Only Whites have the ability to lead, govern, etc. All others are weak and should work for Whites. They are still all children of God. No one race holds His love greater than another. But one and only one is the Master and the others are the children. Whites have a greater responsibility than the others; perhaps they know it and that is why they don't work very hard doing anything except ask for handouts from Whites."
2,David Janssen: Sheriff...,"David Janssen is the sheriff of a small Louisiana town. When a girl is found murdered (was it a man or wild dogs that killed her?), things look like they're going to get exciting. But then, looks can be deceiving. Everyone sort of stands around talking. And talking. Sheriff Janssen investigates by driving to the homes of various suspects to... talk. And talk. A posse is formed to hunt down and kill any stray dogs roaming around. Finally, the dead girl's brother ends up in jail for slugging the town doctor, who had gotten the girl pregnant. The werewolf shows up, tears the bars off the window, kills the deputy, and murders the brother in his jail cell. Now we're getting somewhere! Well, not really. Nothing else happens that could be described as remotely interesting. The werewolf (Bradford Dillman) looks like a man with a dirty nose who needs a shave. His sister (Barbara Rush) spends most of the movie talking with David Janssen. And talking. And talking..."
4,Superb,"This book had my attention from beginning to end. It has a bit of everything I like in a book; intrigue, swordplay, rich hishorical background and unconditional love."
2,Too much discussion around simple concepts,"It is a good book. But it's absolutely a very beginner's book. If someone is serious about option trading, further readings are definately required."
5,Very good for novices,"The book uses simple and easy way to explain the concepts of long/short stock options. Giving a lot of simple examples to let you understand the profit/loss on a simple long/short call/put, time values, intrinsic values, premium. If you are a novice on options, I strongly recommend this book to you as a first book on options.The book do not express much on professional terms like delta, gamma, theta,..... No detail usage of options strategies like straddle, strangle, butterfly spread, condor.....If you are well known on the concept of options, this book is not your choice."
1,No Stars Would Be a More Accurate Rating,"Horrible read with examples that are very difficult to understand as many have stated previously. Choppy, dry, confusing. That sums it up for me. I'm looking for a book written by an experienced and successful Options trader, not an accountant."
4,Great and simple Book,This book is explains the options trading for the beginners in simple language. A great book to start the trading business.
4,Excellent Beginners Guide To Option Trading,"I've been a stock trader and MBA for ten+ years, and always considered options trading too risky. This book was a welcome academic refresher which explained options in every day terms. With-in one month, I made over 30% on my initial investment with limited down-side risk. No bells, no whistles, just the KISS (Keep It Strickly Simple) knowledge to make money in the market."
3,"solid, but could be better...","I found the information presented in this book to be the solid and simple basics of options, but the presentation itself needs a lot of improvement. There are numerous errors (mix-ups between the terms ""put"" and ""call,"" and several erroneous examples), and the book is HIGHLY REPETITIVE--so repetitive as to be extremely de-motivating. I think this book could have easily been compressed into a pamphlet; at its current length, only people who learn best through repetition of scenarios and examples will enjoy this book. Perhaps if the author had enlarged the scope of the book to increase the information density of the book, I'd find it deserving of a permanent place on my bookshelf."
2,neurosis's debut,"although i am a huge neurosis fan this cd just doesn't have the cool ambience or the darkness. this isn't even the same style, it's hardcore, but the worst part it's not even good hardcore. i don't think i like one song on this cd. the only reason i got this cd is because i like neurosis so much. if you like neurosis get through silver in blood, times of grace and enemy of the sun, i think you can just leave the rest alone."
1,Will It Ever Arrive?,"I ordered it on 14 February, it is now 20 Mar. The only thing I have received so far has been a series of revised delivery dates. I can't tell you whether or not the book is any good, I would have to actually receive it to know that."
3,Better Options,"This is a descent book on the subject of marine radar. Since there aren't too many other books on the subject it's probably worth reading. However, the author goes into extreme detail on the engineering and related math of radar systems, something that the average user needs to know little of. You might want to skip that section. The book comes with a demo training radar simulator with the hope of getting you hooked so you'll pay an additional $200 for the real simulator and an online course. Save your money! Read the book (minus the over your head engineering section) and use the demo simulator. Then go out and practice on a sunny day....over and over. If you still feel the need for more instruction take a real classroom course. They're usually less expensive. Boatwise offers one for $79."
5,Best,Best pure nickel strings on the planet earth. They purr and growl where nickel plated strings shreik and yell. Great playability. Just like a warm knife thru butter. The only strings that will ever put on my Telecaster. A match made in heaven!
3,A intresting Anime,"This is your typical 80's style Action/ Sci-fi anime the story gose by rather quickly, the Graphics are typical for the 80's but it was fun to watch.This is a well thought but hurried stoy.It dose contain alot of violence, it dose have some nudity. It is not for children. If you are a die hard Sci-fi anime person you will enjoy this."
2,Some pretty scenery - and that's all,"Strange little film that showed the Pierson family to be of a very different stripe. One example: while the family is in Fiji for the year, and the final month being chronicled on film, the subject of the Pierson's 16 year-old daughter having sex comes up in an interview with the mother. The MOTHER says, ""She's sixteen and it's not up to me to tell someone how much sex to have..."" That should be enough to show you that this is either a very unusual family - or they exploited their lovely daughter for their own purposes in the making of the film. Very sad. Where was the parenting? I suppose this mother would have considered it, ""old-fashioned."" But seriously, what was the purpose of discussing the daughter's sex life at all? And then for mom to condone it as if it's none of her business? Very odd.The film has some pretty scenery, but to be brutally honest, that was the only part of the hour and a half that held my interest."
4,Did the job!,"My husband and I both used these for our recent trip to Turkey, where we did some extensive climbing over rocks, steep paths, etc. Never used hiking poles before - and these proved to be immensely useful! It gave us that extra confidence on some of the trickier terrain. Didn't give them 5 stars, because I'm a tough grader! :)"
2,Already broken :(,"I was really enjoying the poles, and after just 2 months, the wrist strap came off on my hike yesterday so I'm disappointed. I don't think I can repair it."
5,Best Caddy!,"Far the best pole shower caddy you can buy. The metal ones may look nicer but quickly become worn, rusty and ugly! This is SO easy to clean and lasts forever."
4,"Rich and bored is not boring, or is it?","In a deadly 10 round spectator sport participants alternate between being hunters and hunted. Naturally, the huntress falls in love with the ""victim"" of her final round in this highly stylized Italian 60's parody.Until recently The 10th Victim has been worth seeing due to its strong futuristic aestetic value and black humor. However, now the theme of this movie can be seen in a new light. Today audiences - who are bored with staged nastyness - want to see the real thing. This they can find on a host of survival shows, where participants are encouraged to humiliate one another and themselves in various ways. One of the factors that has contributed to paving the way for such Reality TV are the many movies that predicted this form of entertainment. The 10th Victim is an early example."
3,Could be better but it could be worse!,"Should you buy this version of Phantom of the Opera and watch it just so you can say you've seen it? If you're a huge Phantom ""Phan"" then yes but if not then it's up to you to decide. I can't guarantee you'll like it but I can't say I hated it either. It's kind of middle of the road for me. As far as following the original novel is concerned it somehow managed to follow the novel without following it. I don't know how frequently I'll watch it again but I doubt it will end up in my Phantom graveyard either { unlike a certain Phantom of Manhattan we all know and would love to burn }. It has its good moments and its bad moments. You can't be too picky with the quality of the sound or picture since it is a taping of a stage show but yeah. Some of the acting could have been better but oh well."
1,Disappointing,"If you have dreams about watching Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""The phantom of the Opera"" or something close to that, do not even attempt to buy this one, because you will be shocked and dissapointed by how the producers turned a fantastic story (which could have been a fantastic movie also)into something so bad. Especially the music is so disappointing and ear-scratching after the Weber version."
1,This musical theater version falls far short of Broadway.,"I have enjoyed performances of Phantom of the Opera in New York and San Francisco where you pay extravagant prices for major-league theatre. This video is not worth the discounted price of $20. The orchestra, the dance, the vocals, the costumes and the acting are all minor-league. For an absolutely pleasurable musical theatre experience on video, try CATS. You will not get up from your chair or pause your VCR for anything until the end. I guarantee it!"
1,Too bad as a musical,This version of phantom is far worse than Andrew Lloyd Webber's. I watched this one first and unfortunately the music was so boring that I fell in sleep. The lyric is also without power. Do not waste money and time on this one.
1,This wasn't the best I've ever seen...,"Well, I am a big and long time phan and this was a bit of a disappointment. Not to say that it's the actors fault. It's just the story was what did it. The sets, the music and the script, as well. The ending....well, it's not for Erik/Christine wishers. I wasn't expecting ALW's, but I thought it would be better then what it was. The actors/singers were good, but they weren't given a lot to work with."
1,Unbelievably Bad,"This musical interpretation of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" has to be one of the worst yet. There are no redeeming qualities in this production. From the very beginning it's amateur night in the theater. DVD looks like it was made on the cheap. Sound is distorted at times-there is no booklet/ very little info on back of box. Stay away from this one- it is not enjoyable."
2,Not for use on the stove!,"Very nice looking teapot but small and NOT FOR USE ON THE STOVE!!! It's only to serve tea. It says ""Never use it as kettle."" This should have been mentioned on the website. Now we have to return it."
4,Great Item,"I love this item - it helps to keep my bathtub/shower area free of so many separate bottles. The only thing I dislike is that it stops dispensing the product when there is still some in the container, but once refilled it's back to working great."
2,Disappointed,"I own a Better Living Classic IV Dispenser and it is wonderful. Works perfectly! So I ordered the III for my hall bath. 2 of the bottles will not work with any amount of product or priming (we've wasted almost a full bottle of shampoo and over an hour trying to get them to work). We cannot request replacement bottles as this is an AMAZON purchase and there is not an option to contact the seller. We do have the option to return the product, but we mistakenly placed this on the shower wall before we realized the bottles didn't work, and it will be quite cumbersome to remove. We are planning to purchase another IV Dispenser and just hope all the bottles are good (like they were in my first order) and we will just use those bottles in the III. Wish us luck! Very disappointed in all I'm having to do to make this Dispenser work for us."
1,MP3 DOES NOT INCLUDE All 10 TRACKS!,"MP3 DOES NOT INCLUDE All 10 TRACKS! It is only one song. You have to purchase the CD single to get all 10 tracks listed here. The customer reviews are very misleading, so be careful. When it says ""download the album here"" again, it's just one song -- the original."
5,A Valuable Expansion for all AD&D Campaigns,"This book offers both DMs and players a great opportunity to expand magic within their campaigns. In addition to giving a great array of new spells, the Tome of Magic includes several new wizard classes, all of which have become common in many AD&D campaigns. I especially liked the new wild mage class, which incorporates a moditied (and certainly fun-enhancing) spell casting system. The expansion of the priestly spheres of magic significantly enhanced the previously limited selection of priest spells. The only downside of this product is the selection of new magical items, many of which have not proven to be useful in my campaign. Overall, I have found the Tome of Magic to be one of the most useful accessories for the AD&D game."
3,nice card.,"This bundle is essentially a Sound Blaster Live! card, with the Live! drive and all the trimmings. It also includes an infrared remote control. If you add surround sound speakers, playing games can be enthralling. Imagine playing a game and actually hearing someone walking behind you (or shooting).The bundled software ranges from cool to useless. The games are nice, but I find the Keytar application particularly worthless. It presents the image of guitar which you ""play"" by strumming (moving the mouse).If you want the convenience of plugging in cables without reaching around to the back of the PC (like for headphones) or MIDI, then this bundle is for you. If not, then I would recommend the MP3 or X-gamer versions which are both cheaper.Also, please note that the installation CD will install a spy-ware application, which will sometimes ""phone home."" It can be removed by editing the registry without any ill effect. For privacy invasion, I have to deduct at least one star."
3,Great Shower Dispenser,This item reduces clutter in the shower and allows quick dispensing of shampoo and conditioner without shaking bottles. Easy to clean. Looks nice. I have also bought several for gifts.
2,Not Anti-Fogging,"It is supposed to not fog up but still it does. If you put shaving cream on the mirror it helps a bit, but not much."
5,Amazing!,"I watched this for the first time and it was marvelous. Given all the trash out there, it's great to see a really enjoyable and totally uplifting show. Mr. Crawford's energy and athleticism are amazing, demonstrated by his walking the tightrope across the stage without a net. The entire production is a dellight, even an apparent prop malfunction early on from which the star so gracefully recovers is a magic moment. The entire cast is a joy to watch and the pace never lets up, I was breathless at the end just watching.Best known as the original Phantom of the Opera, a visual record of which is not available to the public, this is Mr.Crawford's only theatrical work to be so well preserved. His work in Barnum lifted him above his reputation for lightweight comedy characters, showcased his vocal range and was his stepping stone to getting the Phantom part.This show will stand the test to time and be a delight for decades to come and would make a great gift to old and young alike. Bravo."
4,Michael Crawfiord's Barnum,"Having seen the play as it was presented in London, this DVD was most accurate. Again I enjoyed the enthusiasim of Crawford doing ALL the parts."
5,80s group still kicks,Top to bottem this album rules. Not one bad song. I love the vocals. This is definetely worth buying.The song velvet is awesome. I cant believe these guys dont get air play.
3,Ok,It was ok. like others better. will pick another book from same author. like the author. redeeming love was gteat.
4,good read,It was interesting all the way thru. It was a good clean book with a good plot and some great characters.
5,Wonderful story!,"I have long said that Francine Rivers is the best of the best in the Christian historical romance genre. Sin Eater takes her to a new level. What a wonderful, insightful novel. The depth of character development and the beautiful simplicity of the plot is stunning. Beautiful story written by a beautiful lady.This one's gonna win the gold!"
3,Kindle edition,"I am a huge France Rivers fan but I did not think was one of her best books. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the book but would not rate it on the top of her list. As far as the Kindle edition goes - it was horrible! There were missing parts, words different sizes and structures, huge spaces where there should not have been spaces. I was very disappointed with the Kindle copy of the book."
3,Very good,Like many of Francine Rivers books it souls you and you learn as you read this very thought provoking book. Francine Rivers has a true gift. The plot line is compelling and makes your mind really think.
5,Wonderful,This book really challenged me to think about my own habits and traditions that enslave me t o th I s world and keep me from experiencing the freedom that I have been given buy savior. Once pulverized to the dialect there is some great humor. Francine rivers write beautifully. Her passion for God s word is evident in her writing. What a blessing she is to those who enjoy historical fiction.
4,Thought provoking,"It took a while to get into this story. It's different dialogue was a little difficult to follow, but it was worth the extra effort. I love the way it ended."
5,Brought me to their world,"I read this is 2003, and have recommended it to many friends since. I just love the plot, the imagination in it, and also the way they spoke and the cadence of the story. I have such strong ideas in my mind of who Cadi and Fagan and Cullen and all the characters are now, that I almost don't want to see the movie, because I am afraid it will change the way I think of the characters and story now, and I don't want that to be lost in any way. This is a great mystery, and great romance all in one, and I recommend reading the book before you see the new movie."
2,Very narrow!,"I bought my size and thought I would be able to wear these sandals. I was totally wrong since they are very narrow and it didn't say they were narrow. My foot is not even wide, so unless you have very narrow feett, do not buy them because you will waste your money."
4,authentic,Very authentic moves and forms.Her English is not great. But the subtitle on key points compensate for that.Demonstration is clear and straight. Helpful tips
4,Pilates Intermediate Mat Workout,Once you're comfortable with Pilates Beginning Mat Workout this video is the next step. It builds on the exercises you learned in the beginning and increases speed and reps for a challenging Pilates workout.
1,No Personality - No Motivation - No Fun!,"I am new to Pilates, and I have two other Pilates DVDs that I bought about two months ago. I thought this one would be a good next step, but I was wrong! The instructors in both of the other DVDs really made me want to keep going, even if the exercises were hard....but this one was so dry I just wanted to turn it off and take a nap! If you are looking for a fun program that will keep you motivated while you exercise, I would suggest you choose something else."
2,I expected more for 40 dollars,"I was shocked at the thinness of this book. Not including the Appendix and and intro, I count about 73 pages. Many of those pages contain tables and many of those tables were *very* simple re-hashes of the examples. I feel like I spent way too much money on this book.It does a good job at explaining NQSOs and ISOs and all the quirks of each. When it got to the part I was really interested in ""Two Tax Saving strategies"", I found that while it does present some general ground rules and some examples, it ends up saying basically that it all depends on your situation. I half expected to read the proverbial ""speak to your tax advisor about your specific tax situation.""If you want basic info about Stock Options, you can find that on the Web. If you want general advice about what to do with your options - exercise and hold; delay; etc., this will give it. If you want detailed advice and formula for figuring out what to do, get something else."
2,Good on fundamentals but not much more,"The book is a helpful starting point for people totally unfamiliar with employee stock options. However, it does not give any innovative strategies for handling the options. It is simply a good source of basic information. Not written for professionals but may be useful for the beginner. (Although it is not bad for a self-published work.)"
5,Tough Topic - Made Simple,This book contains pertinent information that is presented in a clear and concise manner with plenty of examples to aid understanding.
5,Great organization product,"We have one of these in each bathroom and in our RV, they all do a great job and we are pretty rough on them. Eventually some parts wear out, but there are 9 of us, so that is expected. It sure keeps the shampoo and condition mess to a minimum."
4,GREAT DISPENSER,"I found this dispenser to be a great replacement for another brand that I purchased a few years ago. I put it up with ease and have had no problems. I only gave it a 4 star rating because it is not as good looking as some other models I have seen or purchased. I did follow the instructions to prime the chambers for use. So far, so good."
5,"Great looking, functional dispenser","Really nice product. Straight, simple lines - easy to install. Looks super. Just moved to new home; had one for over 15 years! Ordered exactly the same unit 15 yrs later and it still looks great!"
1,dissatified ex-Marine,"This was a total disaster, item was broken when arrived, missing parts, couldn't get it to stay connected,ie. sweatband would not connect to helmet"
1,How the British see IT,"""This is one of the FEEL-GOOD British books. The history of the Western World begins with the British defeating the Spanish armada, and ending on Waterloo . ""British"" victory."
2,"A collection of technical papers, not a how-to.",This book is a collection of technical papers on the chemistry and industrial processes of cheesemaking. It is not a how-to guide for making artisan cheeses at home.
3,No recipes,"This is an informative book about the history of cheese, how cheese is made at a molecular level, and starting a cheese company. What it doesn't give you is basic cheese recipies for the novice. I bit more involved than I wanted. Interesting reading, but now I STILL need another book to take me through a BASIC recipe and a list of equipment I can use that can be found in the regular home kitchen. I am making a couple of pounds of mozerella, not a large vat of Brie!"
1,Not as shown in picture!!!,Not easy at all to install. Picture shows a totally different version of this unit than what you will get. Cutting a rail required and not easy to calibrate. You might want to look elsewhere or check mfg's website for installation directions first to see if you want to try the unit that you will receive. I wish that I had.
1,more rehashed material...,"Put ""tactical"" in the title and sell it. If that doesn't work--call it a ""terrorist interdiction tactical manual of arms"" and sell it. Whatever it takes to bring in money and rubes (note: his glock 18 mags went up in price to $50 the day after they were used in the AZ shooting--his store says, ""buy them now before politicians ban them!""...anyone who uses tragedy to profit is a lowlife with no class). Like the other reviewer said, Gabe is a ""weak man with poor self esteem, and an inflated ego. I can not honestly recommend this book.""Anyone who disagrees with his Christian-soldier-Taliban-like fundamentalism is banned from his forums (myself included) without explanation--down the memory hole just like in 1984. Like Big Brother, he runs a tight ship for image control so that the clowns don't get a clue."
1,What I Learned About Shooting at the Police Academy,"The contents of this book are largely lifted from Police training manuals, and are not suited for the average citizen, unless you happen to be in a militia or you are a member of Al-Queda. I can't imagine why ordinary gun-enthusiasts would be interested in combat with fellow citizens, clearing and entering houses with hostile foes, and all the other techniques on offer here. Suarez makes a big deal about how he is a decorated officer, but no police officer worth their salt would put out books teaching citizens to be members of a tactical SWAT team.The author obviously isn't a police officer in good standing anymore because no commanding officer would permit someone to profit off the tactics presented here.If you are a gun-enthusiast, you would be better off buying something by John Farnam or Andy Stanford. Their books are written for citizen gun owners, and they don't teach how to indiscriminately kill people."
3,Some good advice but a little annoying,"A marriage counselor highly recommended this book to me and claimed that it helped all of his clients. I guess they'd give it five stars, but I had a hard time getting past the style of writing. I felt like I was reading a sales pitch for Smalley's other books and videos. I found the annecdotes about Smalley a bit drab and non-relevant--more like memoires written for his family and friends. The parts of the book that didn't annoy me, bored me. There is some good advice in there, but nothing novel that I haven't heard before. I did like the way Smalley described the importance of God in one's life and relationship, which is why I gave it three stars instead of two. I'm 33 and would not recommend this to my friends."
1,URC RF10 remote,"The item arrived on the promised date, was well packaged.Documentation is very good. It also came with a DVD which outlines nicely the set up, but really is superfluous.I really wanted to like the remote, but the one which I received would not always retain those commands that I had to ""teach"" to the unit.Therefore I will be returning it.I also have the URC R50, which performs very well, but now is just too costly to purchase another iteration of."
4,Awesome DVD,I would give it a 5 except the recording is a little crappy. There are spots where the colors flash from black and white back to color. I have this both on VHS and DVD so it is the actual program that is filmed this way not just a mistake that happened while recording from the master.I did this program a couple of times a week while recovering from back/shoulder/neck injuries. It really helped with my back and I also happened to lose a decent amount of weight when I combined it with more mindful eating.
4,Yes! This is probably the video you are looking for!,"I would recommand pilates to anyone! I tend to be somewhat uncordinated, so aerobics has never been an option for me (plus, I find the hostesses usually very annoying. The hostess on this one is easy to deal with). This is a great video for beginers. Also consider purchasing (from Drugstore.com) the set that includes the mat, body ring and body ring workout video. For under $100, and after only doing this 4-5 times, people will notice!I didn't give this video a 5 becuase it is a little slow, even for beginers."
5,Caban is a wonderful instructor,This video is very well explained and Caban makes Pilates a very light and fun experience with her bright smile and work ethic. The tape is challenging enough to push you to do your best and want to IMPROVE! My posture has already striaghtened up and my abs are firming and i have not yet reached 10 sessions. It's 20 minutes well worth it. I have the itermediate video and can't wait to get to it once i have managed the beginner video.
2,Only for complete beginners.,"This is a very good starting place for anyone who is an ABSOLUTE beginner. If you have even a bit of coordination or have dabbled in Pilates or Yoga this dvd will be too slow for you.While the instruction on the poses is good, the progression is very slow and you'll feel like you're lying around waiting for your workout to begin.The second part of this series (Intermediate Mat Workout) is an excellent workout and the instruction in the dvd is clear enough even if you haven't done this one first.If your remotely fit and coordinated, I would recommend skipping directly to the second offering in this series."
1,Red Flag-- Take a class!,"This is NOT for beginners. The instructor does not spend time on form, especially the importance of breathing-- I was shocked! If you plan on just working out at home using a video, this is definitely not the one. It honestly scares me that there are people relying on the quality of instruction on this tape as their only guide to Pilates."
2,Okay but not great,"This wasn't what I expected. I'm not sure what I expected exactly, but this wasn't it. And the lady on the tape is ANNOYING! She even refers to her ""tush"" as if it were made of gold and we should all strive to be like her. If you like irritating, chirpy women then maybe you won't mind. I can think of better workouts!"
1,Dont waste your time,"My husband gave me this as a gift knowing I like to workout and was looking for a new pilates program, otherwise I would never have bought it.If you use the method pilates then this will be too easy for you, and the method series is pretty easy to begin with.I have back problems and this only made it worse, now reading the other reviews on this page I wish I had seen them before I did it the first time.Some things are better to just pay the extra money and pay an expert to teach you how to do them right. Save your money and go to a class or a pilates instructor and use a machine. It is a world of difference."
2,Disappointed,"From someone who was introduced to pilates at a studio, this video was disappointing. The instructor moves way too fast to properly complete the moves. She misses key tips to help execute the moves properly. I recommend trying another instructor!!!!"
3,Short and no warm-up,"I think the title of my review says it all already. The workout is not bad, but it is only about half an hour long ( including the initial instructions about breathing ) and there is virtually no warm-up. The instructor makes you start with 'the hundred' and claims that 'this is your warm-up'."
2,A Waste of Cargo Space,"I purchased the Pirates' Beginning Mat Workout in an effort to ensure the good health and combat-readiness of my crew on our long ocean voyages raiding merchant vessels on the Spanish Main. To my dismay, I discovered that the excersize program was completely unsuited to the demands of seamenship and hand-to-hand combat, but seemed to be aimed at land-loving couch potatos out to trim a few extra pounds off their beer guts. If you value the lives of your crew, I strongly urge you to spend your loot elsewhere."
1,Not happy with product quality,"Product is faulty and jolts in my dvd. A complete waste of money as I will not sell to someone knowing it's faulty, unlike this seller."
4,great video but needs more detail,"the video is great and the intructor is entertaining. However, I wish they was a section on the dvd that explained the exercises very slowly and in more detail. I have a book that I use to supplement the video and I have been very happy with the combination."
2,Not enough of a workout,"I am not in the greatest shape, and I thought this was too short/easy. Plus the video effects are annoying. Would not recommend."
3,"Good cream, poor package","I really like this foot cream, but the packaging is poor. Two of the tubes had cracked squeeze nozzles so the cream comes out all over the top. Needs better packaging."
3,Sad read,">From the Black Hills Judy Troy Random House 1999 ISBN 0375502300 P.B. FictionIt is the summer after high school graduation and Mike Newlin is an average 18 year old, except his father has killed his secretary whom he was having an affair, now he has left to parts unknown. This was a very depressing book to read, I found it hard to stick with. The story line flowed well enough so well that you felt every hurt and pain that Mike goes through at his young age. It is very hard for Mike to go on after his father is gone, he must look out for his mother who thinks that her life is nothing without her husband,his girlfriend who is clinging all the time, and the fact that he is in love with his bosses wife. As you read this book keep the kleenex box handy because you will need them. Judy Troy is the author of two New York Times Notable books and a Whiting Award Winner."
3,The Complete Upholsterer,"Pretty good book by and large. I guess that learning a trade through a book is not going to happen. Nevertheless, I think it could include more aspects of upholstery and have more detailed step by step illustrations. Certainly very good as an overview with nicely chosen historical pictures."
5,Balance...it's what every mom needs!,"The Balanced Mom is an easy to follow, step by step guide to help moms find the delicate balance between work, family and self. Broken down into manageable bite sized chunks makes the tips and suggestions realistic enough to incorporate into mom's already overly extended day. Any mom will benefit when they learn how to more effectively balance their lives. This book helps to show them how. Debi Silber (Registered Dietitian, Certified Personal Trainer, Whole Health Coach)"
3,good but not as good as her first dvd,In general it is still good. This one is not as detailed as her first dvd. A lot of moves are rushed. I wished they had spend more time on the moves that were not covered in the first video.
5,The best lil-bratz toy yet!,"I was very excited when I heard about the new Lil~Bratz beach bike and what it came with. Meygan is my favorite brat and I was very happy that they finally made a version of her for the Lil~Bratz series. The bike comes with many accesories which are fun to play with. I would highly reccommend this toy for children of all ages. Un-like barbies, teens can collect bratz because they do not dress in pink, frilly dresses."
5,"5 Stars for Ella , negative 10 stars for production","How does a title like this make it onto the market? Do they not have quality control?This is my second purchase of the same title, i thought i may have just had a dud the first time, what a shame for a wonderful lady! Of course she looks great and the sound is superb, but it would be nice to have those in sync!"
1,Not a very good GPS,It is not user friendly when it comes out of the box. It does not know the current location when it power up and user has to set current location!? I have not seen any GPS on my car like this. Redrawing map is slow and creating route is difficult. Overall user interface is bad.
5,Music that will talk with your soul!,"The music of Michael Ganian is unique. Listening to this cd while sitting in the balcony and looking at the sunset on the ocean is an experience like none other. If you like the music of Astor Piazolla, Gotan Project or Bajofondo Tango Club, this cd will surpass your expectations! Definitely buy this cd."
4,Fellner Does Good Job on Beethoven Concertos,"The young Austrian pianist Till Fellner teamed with the famous British chamber orchestra Academy of St. Martin in the Fields in 1994 and they recorded the set of two Beethoven's early piano concertos for the French label Erato.Fellner does a good job, his technique is more than adequate for the pieces and his musicality soars on slower movements. The orchestra under Sir Neville Marriner is as polished as ever, making for an impressive recording, which deserves much more attention than it actually gets. In fact, I got this CD in a local store in Slovakia in 2001 for a very bargain price (about USD2.20!)I do not think you will go wrong with purchasing this album, even if you already have some recordings of Piano Concertos 2&3. Fellner and Marriner certainly do no shame to the great composer."
5,good deal,"My 174 Sailfish only had a 8"" deep tank. This unit was easy to adjust, seals good (comes withe new screws & gasket) works Great. Did i mention the fast shipping."
1,maybe the dog will eat them,"These are not only gluten, egg, dairy, etc etc etc free; they are flavor free as well. Dry, sandy, virtually no taste. I couldn't detect even a hint of lemon, and there seems to be about 8 poppy seeds per biscotti. Hard to believe these are made by the same company that makes the chocolate animal cookies, which are terrific. Perhaps Orgran 'Natural' is different fr/Orgran 'Gluten free.' In any case, I've got 9/10s of a bag of ""biscotti"" that I'm going to see if the dog will eat. Expensive doggie treats."
3,Disappointing and dry,"I thought this book would be more ""down-to-earth"" informative, but it is actually a collection of articles on endometriosis written by doctors and experts on the disease. I found it hard to read and not as instructive for the average sufferer as I had hoped. I did like the ""Joe with Endo"" cartoons throughout the book depicting what it would be like for a man to suffer with this malady, but I found most of the articles to be more like what one would find in a medical journal."
2,Dry,"I came here in search of ""The Endometriosis Answer Book: New Hope, New Help,"" which I had started reading at my doctor's office, but after reading all the positive reviews for this book purchased it instead. It may be more up to date, but it's dry, bland, flat, and skitters lightly across the various topics, presenting a series of short articles that don't go into the depth I wanted. I also found it coldly technical in places, and I must have an entirely different sense of humour than readers who liked the sketchy little comics scattered throughout. I'd like my mother to learn more about my condition, so I'll be sending her ""The Endometriosis Answer Book: New Hope, New Help"" instead -- it's much a better introduction to and explanation of what I'm going through for someone who isn't experiencing it herself."
2,This is not for left handed people,"I actually read a review stating it was not for left handed. But bought it anyway because the scissors depicted in the picture are actually lefthanded. How misleading. Useless to buy this one if you are left handed. I returned it.Furthermore, the scissors were packaged with cut off tie wraps on a piece of cardboard. I actually cut myself twice in an attempt to open it. Bad packaging design."
5,Warning: I am NOT religious (anymore),"I wanted to add that disclaimer so you wouldn't reject my review out of hand. Even though it is a bit preachy, the lesson is a good one for the religious and the secular alike. It's a message of mercy, and also makes it very clear that just because you have made bad decisions in the past doesn't mean you are worthless or that you cannot overcome your mistakes.Preaching aside, this is an entertaining adventure, and I enjoy it for that reason alone. Just because a book has a religious theme doesn't automatically make it bad. And heck, just because the lesson is religious in origin doesn't make it less valid."
3,Little Mistake,"My dad was an extra in this movie. He was one of the mall security guards. If you look close, you can see him looking at a map on the wall, then walking around the mall at the same time. I know its nothing, just one of those things we noticed when first watching it."
5,Party time!,"I love it when he throws the beer bottle and hits the old lady in the head. Also, when the beach chick is riding on the hood of the car. ""Lose her, man!"""
3,THE BOYS NEXT DOOR,"I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE FOR NOSTALGIA.YOU HAVE A YOUNG CHARLIE SHEEN AND HIS FRIEND, DECIDE TO TAKE A ROAD TRIP TO L.A. BEFORE THEY GET STUCK FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES AT A FACTORY JOB. IT SHOWS CHARLIE'S FRIEND LOSES HIS MIND,BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ANNOY,OR GET ON HIS NERVES.SO HE DECIDE'S TO BEAT THEM,OR WITH SOME HE DECIDE'S TO KILL THEM,OVER LITTLE THINGS.AT THE END CHARLIE IS FORCE TO MAKE CHOICE ABOUT HIS FRIEND.I WOULD RECOMMEND IT."
2,Very disapointing userinterface,"I bought this unit to scan old photos and slides. The software that drives the scanner is not intuitive to say the least. It has a fully automated mode to pick the best results for the user, but it ""remembers"" the settings from the previous manual operation. The ""professional"" mode does not let you control the size of file you create. Stay away unless you want a cheap product"
4,Totally Confidential Review!!!!,Do you want to read a book about a girl who has to keep a REALLY BIG secret?Well If so then this book is for you. Sally warner did a wonderful job writing this book(Totally Confidential). If you like excitment and reading a book you never want to put down then you should go to the nearest library or local book store and pick-up Totally Confidential.By the time you finished reading your book you'll want to pick it up again and read it over!!!
3,Good but....,"Printer does a lot of things right. It's cheap, it's fast. Setup was easy with the software provided.Problems after 1+ year of use: it jams a lot. So just be ready to pull paper bits out of strange openings frequently."
4,Great Printer,"I have only had it for a day.The print quality is excellent.The documentation is terrible and the Samsung website is pathetic. Samsung's knowledgebase website won't work with Safari or Firefox!!!!You have to have a brain the size of a (small) planet to figure out how to get the networking working, but luckily I do.Works great from my XP desktop, XP wireless laptop, and Mac.Prints fast. Loud but not bad. When I print on 3x5 cards they come out curled, but regular paper comes out OK.I will update this as I use it more."
5,A SHORT Messiest Moments REVIEW,"Also released in 1988 along with The Inside Scoop, The Messiest Moments features all of the sloppiest, slimiest, ickiest Physical Challenges and Obstacle Courses. Marc and Harvey do skits to introduce each segment, and at the end, Marc gets pummeled with an enormous amount of yellow slime.Visit http://www.freewebs.com/doubledare/doubledaremerchandise.htmTo view a picture of this item."
1,"Quality of the book, not the content a very big disappointment","In all the years I have purchased anything other than new from Amazon or one of its affiliates, I have never been disappointed; this time, it was an embarrassment. The inside cover was written all over, pages were all yellowed, and marked up. Bad news"
4,tire pressure guage,"The description and a statement on the package are incorrrect. The dial does not continue to show the pressure after the gauge has been withdrawn from the tire valve. However, since the dial swivels, it is easy to read the pressure while the gauge is on the valve. This shortcoming aside, the guage is sturdy, accurate, and easy to use."
4,Good quality boxes,"I bought these boxes to replace some old ones that had gotten damp and rotted (luckily my comics were in sleeves, so no damage there). These boxes showed up in good condition, and were very easy to fold together and assemble. They seem very sturdy and the cardboard is good and heavy. I would buy these again."
1,Stay away from Troy-Bilt trimmers!!!,"This thing is a piece of junk! I have had it less than three years and it looks destined for the scrap heap. Thing starts easily enough and is powerful, but the brush cutting blade is too soft and does not hold up like my previous Homelite did (cutting blade is soft and now has several dents cause it doesn't handle thick brush very well). Last summer, the pull cord started giving me trouble by first not going back in right away. Then it was somehow missing when I pulled the cord out. Wanted to get it fixed, but none of the service dealers listed on the Troy-Bilt site for my area (62049) work on these. Since I could find nobody to work on it and still had weeds/grass to trim, I continued to use it and now the pull cord has broken. For the price, I expect a longer life and at least one service provider. If you buy a Troy-Bilt weed trimmer, make sure someone in your area services these (and just because there website gives names doesn't make it so)."
1,Service Problems,"If you buy this online, make sure you have a local shop that will do warranty repair. Mine did not run well out of the box, and by the third time I used it, it would not run at all. I found that most of the service centers listed on the Troy-Bilt site would not work on it, and the nearest one that will is nearly an hour's drive away. There are plenty of other service centers in my area, they just will not do warranty work on Troy-Bilt. If you do not have a local center, buy it from someone who will service it."
2,Leaks after 6 months,"Bought this in November of '11 and it is leaking (July '12). It was a replacement for one that my sons had knocked down and broke and I was excited to be able to replace it so quickly and easily without having to swap out the mounting hardware. But after two fills, two of the chambers have started to leak. And now what??"
2,The Pheromone Golden Bath & Shower Gel is runny.,"When I opened the bottle and tipped it to put some on my fingertips, it ran down my arm. I suspected it was watered down. I was quite disappointed as it is my favorite all-time fragrance!"
5,Paul Bunyan and the Winter of the Blue Snow,"This is an absolutely delightful book, made even more so by the splendid illustrations. Down South, where it rarely snows, the kids love reading about the snow and think it's a riot that the snow turned blue! A cute story brought vividly to life by Carolyn Stich's imaginative, detailed drawings."
3,ok,"I love Hugh Grant, which was the inspiration behind it, but it wasn't the best movie i've seen. About a boy is a pretty good movie not four stars but good, American Dreamz was just sad!"
2,Would you really put your baby's pacifier in this?,This seems like a handle pouch for a pacifier but I can only do it if it's in a plastic sandwich baggie. The concept is convenient but just seems so unsanitary to me.
1,Great idea- not a great product. Skip it!,I loved the pacifier pocket the first week. It was so convenient to have the pacifier on the outside of the diaper bag in an easy to find location. But the snap that secures the pocket stopped working and the pocket would constantly fall off. I returned the product!
2,Not What I Hoped For,"I was so looking forward to these shoes, especially after reading all the wonderful reviews. They did arrive very quickly and I tried them on right away. The fit was fine, but I found the meshy fabric too be loose. I couldn't do alot of walking in them because I thought they would fly off. The fabric was very breathable and the arch and heal support was wonderful. Wished they would have worked, but I had to send them back."
5,UPLIFTING,This mussic takes you to another dimension...........it music communicates with my spirit and ignites my imagination....it definitely is the lanuage of the soul...........very relaxing...one of the best I have heard in years.
4,Excellent but incomplete,"Excellent description on mathematics needed in economic analysis especially in advanced level. But it do not include some topics such as dynamic optimization, integraion."
4,Good for what it is.,"Every undergraduate student that wants to earn a PhD in economics is usually told to take a set of math courses. These tend to include all the calculus courses, linear algebra, differential equations, real analysis, and mathematical statistics. If you've taken, or are taking all those courses, then this book will seem easy. However their are some things in this book that those courses do not teach. The material on optimization will probably be new to you, particularly the Kuhn Tucker theorem. The book is not too hard, nor is it too terse. I urge anyone who thinks that this book is terse and unmotivated to take a look at Walter Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis. That is a terse book, and even then it is very good. Those who complain that this book is too challenging are simply the mathematical have-nots of economics bitching because they don't like heavy math and don't like that modern economics is a field where you cannot do without it."
5,"Wonderful cards, wouldn't be with out them.",I bought these cards many years ago. I loved the pictures. Didn't quite understand them at first but over the years I have come to intergrate them in my thoughts and feelings. I use them like a calendar. 1-3l. and find them quite effective in interpreting things on a daily basis.
1,BOOOOOOooooooooooo!!,"What a waste of my money. I thought this book was going to be good from the reviews, but I was let down in a big way. First, did anyone proof this book at all. I was so confused that I thought I was losing my sight. Thank God I wasn't. I was just reading a book full of errors. Second, the story was not believable in any way. The whole crock of Leslie being stalked by the Faron guy made me cringe, because it didn't make much sense. I want to kill you by throwing pebbles at your window? I don't think so Gwynne.Here's a suggestion. Fans of interracial romance read:Sandra KittMarilyn LeeSeressia GlassEve VaughnOctavia ButlerKim McLarinLisa G. RileyJJ Murray"
3,GOOD,"I liked the fact that the race issue wasn't the main focus. I didn't expect that. It made them being together seem so normal. In reality they are going to have some issues, but it's not the 60's and times are changing, so if it seemed like the author didn't completly focus on that, that was probably partly why. Jordan's charater was a bit annoying though. H e seemed so dominering but I did love that scene where she lost her virginity. It was really beautiful. Interesting that she would write about a 28 year old virgin. Some of the other love scenes could be alittle corny but I would recommend this book."
2,DISAPOINTMENT,I was ready for suppence and danger around every corner.sadly all I got was the floating questions and flat answers.Forster has to build on the the theme of the story not just throw bits and pices in as and after thought.
1,Against the typos,"This book had to be the all time worst book that I have read. There were so many typo, her for here, her for him, him, for her, I was so mixted up I kept having to reread to make sure who was taking. Just bad all together. The story could have been good if we knew a little about Leslie and why she was so flighty so wishy washy, one minute she wanted Jordan the next see didn't, one minute she wants him to make love to her and then the very next second she wants him to leave her alone, what the heck. Please save your money and do not, repeat do not buy this book. Plus I thought this was a new release, from what I understand from reading the other review this is a reprint from 2003. One question Why? Why reprint it and not proofread it!"
1,Disappointing,"This is a list of 75 or so martial artists in alphabetical order. The monotone narrator (who also produced the film and is listed as a Great American Master/Champion)gives a paragraph length explanation of the importance of the martial artist, and then there is footage from that person. Lots of katas, ancient footage from high school gyms, with little exciting footage. I cannot recommend this documentary. Lastly, some of the footage was pulled from the movie ""The Warrior Within"" which is vastly superior to this, and is a must have."
3,Excellent for Davis fans Adequate for others,"This biography will delight young fans of Terrell Davis although readers without a working knowledge of football may have difficulty following the play-by-play descriptions that occur at different points in this story. The vocabulary is acceptable for the target audience, and while the writing is not outstanding - it is adequate."
2,Does not have examples,I want to be honest for this book. I'm a daily trader and want to learn more about technical analysis. After I read this book I notice that this book does not have any examples to make it understandable for readers. It just has explanations that make it boring to read. In my opinion find a book that has examples about real situation during trading stocks. YOU CAN NOT LEARN ONLY WITH EXPLENATIN. My suggestion is read other technical analysis books reviews to find out which one have both explanations follow by examples. Good luck
1,fungus,"My review is this~I was using the facial cleansing pads with teatree oil for several months when my family started to notice that the pigment of my skin was changing,I would use the pads on my face and neck and the back of my neck and yours was the only product I was using~that was 3 and a half yrs. ago and my skin is still without pigment and I want to know if the ingredient's can cause a fungus in the skin?I went to the doctor but they were of no help and to blame this on vitiligo isrediculous.The use of your product has caused severe depressionin my life and I feel that I deserve some answers to why yourproduct would affect my skin like this.please give me a number to call someone at your main branch as I have finally had enoughof questioning why?why?why? me.or have them please call me at612-328-4795 Joel anderson Thank you!!"
1,Chicago Haunts: Ghostly Lore of the Windy City,"I read this book with great anticipation, but finished it with utter and complete disappointment. Instead of being an objective and intelligent addition to the literature of parapsychology, this book is instead a catalog of ghosts which the author then proceeds to theorize away by any and every means she can come up with, including,folklore, mass hysteria and hypnotic roads. Her claim of being a "" seasoned ghosthunter"" is the only humorous line in the whole book."
2,Sucks the life out of the ghost stories,"No pun intended.The author, while a good researcher, is no storyteller. No atmosphere, no drama. Just a matter-of-fact re-telling of local ghostly legends and lore, this book reads more like a tourist guide than a true ghost story book. I was really disappointed, and put this book down several times for extended periods before coming back to it - I was that bored. Even the tale of Resurrection Mary, probably the best-known of the stories in this book, is filled with dry facts, presumably to show off the author's research chops.Supposedly, the author is a paranormal investigator - how about telling us about investigations in any of these places? And how about some direct quotes from people who have experienced the hauntings, instead of ""according to?""Boo, I say. Boo!"
2,alternate history as snack food,"This is alternate history as snack food: quick and clever but ultimately unsatisfying. Harrison's vision of nineteenth-century blitzkrieg warfare is plausible and sometimes fascinating, but his pacing is off, and the well-known characters throughout this book seem no livelier than figures in a diorama. What little character development we have to go on suggests that Harrison's views of Lincoln, Lee, Grant, and Sherman are entirely conventional.A subplot involving Jefferson Davis becomes a botched attempt to add a bass line to a narrative that somehow couldn't find one in the carnage of war. In fairness, however, the book does entertain, and it might be too much to expect Harrison to rise above the commonplace wisdom he affirms here. Having established that Mexico is hot, Ireland is green, and American audacity is not to be trifled with, I look forward to more gripping summer reads from other books."
4,Well worth the read,"I saw the movie and was totally mesmerized. While I had hoped this book would greatly expand on the movie, it really did not. It is still a good book I would recommend."
5,Eyewitness to Victory in Europe,"Maj. Winters presents his eyewitness account of the preparation for deployment to a combat zone and the actions of men and small units committed to combat against the Nazis. There is no ax to grind here, just the stories and events that occurred in the 506th PIR as seen through the eyes of a young officer. No bragging, no complaining, just the straight story as he saw it. A real piece of history and a must read for young officers and NCO's."
2,A book for those who must read everything on a subject,"This is a book for completists. It adds little to David Kenyon Webster's Parachute Regiment which the author could not get published in his lifetime and became of interest only after the TV Series came out. After the mini-series everyone seems to be jumping on the bandwagon. Even Shifty Powers, portraited as barely literate in the series has come out with his own opus. We can only hope he hired a better ghost writer than the late Major Winters."
2,Interesting topic.,"While it took a few pages to get into the story, by mid book I couldn't wait to see how it would end. The book contains spiritual mysteries (who is Quantum Cat, and what lurks deep in the forest?) and a more down to earth mystery (who is the woman in the cottage?). I was disappointed by the ending. It was very abrupt and lacked the depth of the storyline in total."
3,A Little Better Than The Rest,"So far this series has seen some stripped-down versions of comic books and a magician (Timothy Hunter) who really doesn't do anything. Well, in this book, Timothy plays a more active role and actually works some magic.Timothy has two main issues to work out. The first is how to tell Molly about his magic as he has no other secrets from her. The second is to deal with the fact that all of his old beliefs are coming true.Add one character from the previous book who thinks Tim has done him wrong and the plot is set. No real tension, even when an important character has his soul stolen.If you like the previous books, you will like this one, but if you prefer the comics than this one is closer than the rest."
5,Today's reality,From someone who has served in the military for over 15 years and served proudly especially in the Gulf War this book brings to light that with the changing of society and the world itself every country is looking to the cheap mans weapon of biological and chemical weapons. There are many other books out there that are starting to open Americas eyes as to that this will be a common threat in the next century. This book was written by an individual who served in the Russian military and actually headed their BW & CW creations and was in a position of authority when the Sverdlosk incident occured. I think everyone should a least try to read this book because it will open the individuals eyes about how lethal all these types of new weapons are. This type of warfare goes far back in time but now the technology that is in the 21st century can make a big difference.
4,Good Book,"It's a great book in that it takes you from the start of the growing season all the way to the first bottles sold in NYC. It certainly kept my attention throughout, great book for wine lovers."
3,Not for the long haul,"The Wagner HT775 performed well, but not long. I used it every 10 days for 15 minutes per session over almost 4 years, to roast coffee beans. Now the blower runs, but puts out no heat. That's an operating life of only 30-35 hours. I disassembled it to investigate, but can find no obvious problems such as a burnt coil or short. I think it's the switch, preventing me from activating the heating coils. I expected more from Wagner."
4,More great Sci-Fi from Kay Kenyon,"Interesting concept, well-developed characters and Kenyon's flowing style combine for a great read. Highly recommended."
1,What an utter load of crap.,"Gun toting children, talking gorillas, steam-powered (?) aircars and mile-long zeppelins: You'll find all of these while reading this book. Now it's OK if this was, say, a Douglas Adams book, but smith takes his ludicrous alternate history seriously. In Smith's opinion, if we only switched to an anarchist form of government, every human ailment would disappear instantaniously, along with some annoying laws of nature such as the conservation of energy, or the fact that animals can't think like humans. As to the characters... every character was ripped right out of a Heinlein book, and the bad guys are simply pathetic. I'd call it a ""mustn't read"". I'm sorry I ever did - although I got some cheap laughs out of it."
4,"A little dated, but the best general T-1 book available","I teach a college course called T-1 Network Design for which this is the textbook. I have been a practicing professional with T-1 circuits for more than 15 years, and IMHO, this is the best general T-1 textbook on the market. It's getting a little dated, but still not bad."
3,sry,liked the product; it lets me put my puzzle away then go back to it later with out tearing it all up; it's convient; fast delivery.
4,Perfect for Puzzlers!,I bought this as a gift for my sister in law who loves to do puzzles but has nowhere to keep them out when she's not working on them. This was a perfect gift for her and I have not heard any complaints.
1,Puzzle Roll Up,"The picture on the box showed the cloth to be green. It was black and therefore does not work well for puzzles with dark pieces. The material is stiffer and not as thick as I thought it would be. I considered sending the product back, but thought I could use it for something else. I would not recommend it."
2,Picture is significantly misleading,"I ordered these cubes to teach my son about fractions, decimals, percentages and how they interrelate. The cubes that arrive are marked with fractions on one side and blank on the other three. That completely defeats the purpose, and as far as I'm concerned, makes it 3/4ths worthless since only 1/4 of the sides are marked. It would have been one thing if the picture didn't show the other sides marked, but they CLEARLY are. As far as I'm concerned, this is false advertising."
1,Gone In 60 Seconds,"Cooling fan stopped and heat gun burned up, all in the first 60 second of use. Based on others good reviews, I assumed this was a good product, and it may be. Obviously, Wagner has no quality control because mine died in less time than it took to order it. I've only owned one other Wagner product, a paint sprayer with hose to feed paint from a can. It was a joke. It almost caught fire. I won't be buying anything else with the Wagner name on it."
3,DO NOT USE HIGH SETTING FOR LEAD PAINT!,"We purchased this heat gun at our local ACE Hardware. I really wish the manufacturer would state that removing paint at the lowest setting is safer due to the lower temps than at the highest temp, which is what the overview recommends. Many homes built prior to 1978 have layers of lead-based paint. After using this heat gun to remove paint for several days, I realized that the lead can be vaporized at high temps. So, I've ordered a respirator...but ideally this warning would be in the description of the gun, especially if it recommends it for use removing paint. Luckily, my toddler was elsewhere, but now I am a little worried about lead vapor exposure as we're trying for a second baby.Otherwise, the heat gun works as advertised, though the switch is a little easy to accidentally bump on, and it seems a little lower quality overall to a previous heat gun I owned."
1,Poor Quality,"Broke after only a few months, never seemed to run right to start with. Built cheap, cord cracked after first cold snap also."
2,Flexible Programming???,"This unit is very easy to set up with the area code based timing and has the ability to program 4 more individual on/off settings. BUT, I can only run one program at a time - in other words, I can't get it to automatically turn the lamp on just before I get up in the morning, off after I go to work, on just before I get home and back off after I go to sleep. Digital is nice, but setting up multiple on/off times were pretty easy on the old analog timers. Not sure why it's such a challenge this new 'advanced' unit. Also, the Zip Setting only turns things on at sunset. There is no flexibility to use it to turn something off at sunrise or to turn something on 1 hour before sunset.Bottom Line - There should be more functionality for the price."
1,While It Worked It Was Great,Our unit died today 14 months after we bought it. $200 for a replacement? I think not. Just bought the SqueezeBox Boom as a replacement.
3,Difficulty in setting up,"This product took much longer than necessary to setup.1) Your router must broadcast in Wireless B which is not explained in instructions manual. I had to change my settings on my router to broadcast both in g and b.2) The manual instructs to access Windows Media Connect through control panel or through system tray. On my computer, the windows media connect does not show up in either of these places. I had to go through Windows Media Player. Go to tools menu, select options, then select library tab, then select configure sharing, and then select sharing for the Soundbridge (none of this explained in manual).Some other notes: 1) Interface is somewhat difficult; 2) Can not use Jango or Pandora websites; 3) the sound is very good for a small appliance but is not comparable to a a-v receiver system; 4) pretty much does what it advertises to do."
1,"Good idea in theory, but bad power supply kills it","After a great deal of research I settled on the Roku Soundbridge. I bought it and loved it until a week later, on moving it to a different room and plugging it in, it failed to work.Research on the forums for this product on the Roku website reveals that this product has a common defect--a power supply that usually fails within the warrenty period.I returned it to Amazon, but I have not got a replacement, as the Roku is the only one with an Atomic clock based alarm, a concept I like very much.I am waiting for the new model whenever that comes, hopefully with a better powersupply in it this time.A great idea/concept, but badly flawed by the low quality power supply."
3,I love my Soundbridge ... until it dies,"I originally bought my Soundbridge Radio in 2006 when it first became available. I paid about $400 for it through Amazon. It completely died within about 9 months. I was able to get a replacement from Roku, which worked fine until yesterday. Again, it is completely dead, plug it in, no lights, no nothing. I was really, really happy with the product; it had good sound quality and did what I wanted: allowed me to play my Rhapsody and iTunes playlists in the kitchen without setting up a computer there. Occasionally had trouble with it interrupting songs to rebuffer, but this was solved by changing the channel on my wireless router. I am tempted to buy a new one, but even $250 is a lot to spend for something that might only last a couple years. Really wish I could get something reliable."
2,Buyer Beware - Design Flaw - Works for 3 Years,"After several years of it working flawlessly, my Roku just turned off, never to turn back on.I researched the problem, and it turns out that it is the power supply. After reading through Roku's forums, it looks like A LOT of people have this problem.The solution? Buy a refurbished Roku for $199 + shipping.I love the product, but know what you are getting into - a product you will need to replace in about 3 years.Reference: Google ""soundbridge power supply""."
1,Two FAILED Units in Three Years,"My SECOND Roku unit failed 14 months after the first one. When the first one failed, I went 15 rounds with their ""Customer Service"" reps who disowned the problem. Finally, I sent them a draft of the Amazon review I would publish if they didn't send me a replacement, and they finally agreed to send me a RECONDITIONED replacement unit. I'm done dealing with those clowns. These units are a great idea, but a very BAD reality. Too much money for too little durability and a complete absence of customer support. KEEP LOOKING!!!"
2,Some seriously bad prose,"The books suffers from terrible prose. The sentences are interrupted constantly with tangential thoughts set off by dashes and commas and semi-colons. I had to read it very slowly just to make sense of it.The topic is important. The historical data hidden beneath the mounds of unimportant reflective narrative is good.Not worth owning. Not worth reading. If the author could condense it down to about 75 pages, it would be a great read."
3,Good Introduction to Andean Music,"A couple of years ago I became mesmerized with Andean music when I first heard the classic El Condor Pasa. From there on I was determined to obtain a collection of good Andean music. While I think the style of Sacred Valley is good, the depth and variety does not match that of other pan flute artists such as Joel Francisco Perri, Pablo Carcamo and the group called Inkuyo. Their musical pieces and arrangements are rich and diverse. For a most beautiful Andean music album, I advise you to try: Magic of the Paraguayan Harp and Indian Flutes by artists Pablo Carcamo and Oscar Benito put out by the Musical Heritage Society (Classical Music. Believe me I know good music when I hear it! Once you try it, you'll know what I mean!"
4,Amon Guru - 'Krautrock Explosion' (Cleopatra),"Was slightly thrown off the first time I saw this CD. Thought the first couple of tunes looked familiar. After surfing around on the Internet a little, I discovered this was a re-release of Cleopatra's 1998 pressing of Space Explosion (see my review) + four added tracks. Some of you might remember this one-off project featured member(s) of Guru Guru, Cluster and Amon Duul II. Not great, but good. The two added bonus cuts I was most impressed with were the atmospheric ""Anabolica"" and the ambient ""Dat Loop"". Not for every fan of the krautrock, experimental or ambient genres but if you like music that's truly 'out there', hunt down the nearest copy of this semi-odd pick."
1,Looking for a PE Exam reference? Keep looking,"I purchased this book for specific use on the PE Exam (an engineering dictionary is recommended) and was dismayed that NONE of the terms I looked up during the 8-hour test was in this book. The book is heavy into electronic/electrical terms and probably covers the mechanical arena as well, but for civil engineering terms, environmental processes, anything to do with hydrology or water resources, this book is a loser. I do not recommend it unless you are taking the electrical or mechanical PE exam, or just wish to have a general reference handy in your office."
4,A Good Resource for the PE Exam,"I found the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Engineering to be a valuable resource when taking the Chemical Engineering PE Exam (Principles & Practice of Engineering). Having this resource with me on Exam Day enabled me to bag several of the 80 questions that I probably would have missed otherwise.The publication lists a lot of acromyms, many of which don't appear as such in the index of Perry's Handbook, or in the indices of any of my textbooks.Even if you decide it's not much good for anything else, it's still worth the purchase price just to have it with you on Test Day."
3,Good for a novice,Good coverage of some basics. Not so-good for detailed or obscure or really specific information. Better to choose a discipline specific dictionary.
4,Understanding Shan Hai Jing from a different perspective,"It is all good to view the creatures and landscapes described in Shan Hai Jing as something of fantasy. However, this ancient Chinese literature is not all about mythology. Instead, it has its scientific purpose and origin and it is a record of the wisdom and courage of Chinese ancestors. To find out more why it is so, please read Henriette Mertz's ""Pale Ink: Two Ancient Records of Chinese Exploration in America""."
1,alternative energy?,"I purchased this book in hopes of using it in a course I am teaching on alternative energies. If I could rip out the first 30 pages and cross off a few sentences in the remaining pages the book would be a good resource for students to understand alternative energy. However, with the first 30 pages in the book it is nothing more than a book written by Al Gore and all the left wing agendas that go with that. Chapters titled ""Energy Addicts"" and ""Nuclear Power A Failed Promise"" do not belong in a book that is supposed to be introducing the subject of alternative energy. Don't waste your money like I did on this book"
1,An OddBall Movie That Makes No Sense,"The action drifts from one scene to another, none of it making any sense. Spaghetti Western genre better left undone and unviewed."
3,Another Spaghetti Western,"SHORT REVIEW: I've seen a lot of Spaghetti Westerns, and this is just another one. Not bad, not great (thus, 3 stars). Nero, Millian, and Palance are some of the greatest actors to ever be associated with SW's, but overall this is just another re-hashing of the standard SW script format. Very, very similar to the film The Mercenary (aka Revenge of a Gunfighter).The print and presentation here are great; widescreen, no dirt, good sound, nice special features.That's all folks!"
5,insights into alien motives,"Love secrets of alien abductions are revealed. This film plays like a docu-drama, but includes alien actions sequences never before seen on film."
1,Sensational but Misleading,"Look at the other titles written by this author -- Atlantis, the Knights Templar, the Virgin Mary Conspiracy. Nobody with any credibility has expertise in all these fields. They're sensationalist, adventure stories masquerading as history."
5,Simply the Best Vampire Fiction on TV,"This British show does what nothing else seems to have accomplished: it built a supernatural thriller/melodrama that honors both its horror and intrigue elements and origins. The writing is top-notch, the performances first-rate and the cinematography is very, very solid. Though only six episodes, this show left me breathless the first time I saw it, and I've yet to get a bad review when screening it for horror-loving friends. This is highly, HIGHLY recommended for fans of horror, intrigue, melodrama and anyone who thinks that horror shows are unavoidably lame."
3,Cut too short,"A nice enough little series, but ultimately uncompelling. It seems to be intended to be a much longer series, but had to be abruptly cut short, taking all the mystery out of what could have been an interesting story arc. As such, it's ultimately unsatisfying."
5,Great stuff,"Wonderful take on the ""Code 5"" story.I've watched it twice already and while I haven't seen all the extras mentioned here, all I can say is GIMME MORE! Let's see a second series of this instead of one more reality-tv show."
2,Rehashing older stories doth not a novel make,"I find Ed Gorman a good, steady read, but if you have read ""Out There In The Darkness"", a novella, you have already read this story. Although a good story, I have to rate this one low because I dislike buying what I think are new novels, only to find that it is a rehash of an earlier work. Shame on you, Gorman."
1,"Rather pathetic, don't you think...","...that an author would write his own book reviews? Lame, lame, lame."
5,"Evil, Be Gone is Evil Be Good","I must admit that I was a bit skeptical about reading a first-time author like R. J. Estko. But my doubts were quickly soothed after the first chapter of ""Evil, Be Gone."" It's a political thriller... It's complete with all the twists that one expects when power and politics clash. The lead characters aren't necessarily likeable (they're surrounded by some ugly business,) but they aren't meant to be. They're tough, resourceful and admirable. My one question is ""When will we next see Col. John ""Lilly"" Lelankevitch?"""
3,They Shoulda Been On The Soundtrack,"I searched hi and low trying to find this song by Brothers Conti - Automatic. They're were not featured on the House of Wax soundtrack, robbed if you ask me cause that was the only decent song on the soundtrack. Thank god you can listen before you buy. However, the song was excellent, great beats, very catchy... hope they come you wtih their own album soon."
3,Not bad for the price,Not a bad sprayer for the price. Easy to clean up when using latex paints. Does have a tendency to once in a while spray gobs of paint out. I seem to have difficulty adjusting the spray pattern.
1,Big let down,"This sprinkler is not worth the money. It is difficult to adjust, the plastic parts do not stay in place and break easily. I used this item about 4 or 5 times before it became totally useless."
1,Buy From High School to Med. School over this one,"This book should stay where it it says in the title, ""underground."" From High School to Med. School is a more personal, informative, and captivating book. It's written by students for students. So the advice is more current and direct. It's also interesting how this book came out after From High School to Med. School and steals several of the tips, advice, and catch phases: ""Fast track"" etc. I and several of my friends have used From High School to Med. School and they have gained admissions to programs in the past year. So, we are obviously partial to the book, but it works!!!"
2,"Irrelevant, The book falls short on every issue",This book mentions a lot of interesting issues but falls short of covering any of them. My brother who is medical school recommended this razor sharp book by some ivy med students at secretroute.com that book is amazing.
3,Received wrong color iPod Shuffle,"Hi,The delivery speed was fine, however found out several weeks later from receiver of my gift to them came as a green iPod Shuffle not as an orange one as ordered & shown on my order receipt."
3,warm but leaky,"I received this robe as a gift and had high hopes for it. Out of the box, it was warm and cushy on. It's kind of like wearing a lightweight sleeping bag. The sleeves are full-length to the wrist, and they roll up easily and stay put when I'm cooking or otherwise using my hands a lot. The robe is full-length to the ankle. My only gripe is that the robe leaks feathers, at the seams and right through the 300-threads-per-inch fabric. Our sofa and rugs are now coated with a light dusting of feathers, presumably hypoallergenic but still annoying. The feathers poking through on the inside of the robe itch my skin. If this robe had higher-thread-count fabric, it'd be perfect, but unfortunately I can give it only 3 stars. FYI, the instructions say dry cleaning is recommended though machine washing twice a year is okay (?)."
5,Light but toasty warm,"This robe is lightweight but comfortably warm. It comes up around the neck to keep it warm too. The sleeves roll up to adjust the sleeve length. The rolled up sleeves are not bulky. I ordered the Teal which is darker than the online photo which looked more aqua color to me. However, the teal is pretty and hopefully will be less likely to show dirt. It is a good length for coverage when sitting down."
3,Poor quality printed paintings and pages of paperback edition,"I think because the book I've bought is paperback,pages are very thin and print of paintings is poor quality and illustrations are very small and there is not much details,also amount of good paintings of artists awfully deficient.Also most of the illustrations is black and white.But on the other hand there is a huge and deeply information about Northern Renaissance Art."
4,Good and easy read,"A pleasant and a quick read. The characterizations seemed a bit shallow at times, and the language and plotting seemed a bit ""square,"" for lack of a better word. I think Abby and the series have potential, though, and I think the B and C stories could be developed into something cute and interesting, too. I'll try another in the series for sure."
5,Teaching Chess,This was for my grandson who plays chess but not very well. He and another friend would sit and play and learn. It was a terrific gift. Thank you.
3,"Acceptable instrumentals, with one or two surprises","Acceptable instrumental versions of mostly hits, done in a mellow (and anonymous) manner with sax-dominated arrangements and performances. But one or two cuts are intriguing, including a version of ""Talking In Your Sleep"" - the Romantics song from the eighties - that is pretty uptempo, as these things go."
2,Another incomplete Kessinger publication,My 1874 edition of this book has 221 pages. This Kessinger copy has 144 pages. This seems rather incomplete. A complete PDF of the 1904 4th Edition is available free through Google Books.
4,"Beautiful, Goofy, Intriguing Herzog","""Fata Morgana"" (referring here to desert mirages), is one of Werner Herzog's strangest movies. It has no plot or characters. Much of it was shot in the Sahara (hence the title), presenting the filmmaker as mystical adventurer/explorer and visionary. Some parts of the movie were shot in contemporary Germany. There is an evocative poetic voice-over about paradise. All in all, I was both hypnotized and greatly impressed by this film. It's definitely not for everybody, but if you're mystically adventurous yourself, and have a sense of humor, this might be something you'd appreciate."
3,A little disapointed,"To be honest, I cant really complain too much about this jacket because I paid less than twenty dollars for it, yet I still have complaints. This jacket is a lot thinner than you probably would think it to be, and it looks like they skimped on materials whenever they had the chance. My biggest complaint though is the way it fits. I am about 6' 3"" and usually a large jacket will fit me, and XL is usually for fat people. The jacket fits good in the mid section but the sleeves are way too short. Even completely stretched they don't reach my wrists. Maybe I am just abnormal, but the jacket is unwearable to me."
2,Manual is okay,"Good delivery service, but the manual is just okay - it's missing some important details."
4,If,"If you think that the educational system has become bloated and depersonalised. If you agree that there must be a change in the way we teach and be taught. If you agree with Jensen's and other's views on this matter, then this book is for you. This book is not meant for everyone, but it wasn't made for everyone either. This book is for the open-minded and analytical, not for those who hate schooling for little to no reason, not unless you are searching for a reason WHY you loathed waking up on weekdays for the past 18 years. If you agree, then buy this book."
3,Book Analysis,"After reading the book ""Walking on Water"" i have learned many things. One of the most valuable things that I got from this book was to always say what you think. Don't go around watching what you say because you have the right to say what you want and think. The author Derrick Jensen always said what he thought in class and he was not scared of what any of his students would say. He always knew that someone would not agree with him and that was okay. A lot of people are scared to say what they believe because they are scared of people disagreeing with them. I don't think people should care what others think and I don't think that anyone should have to watch what they say because you are entitled to think whatever you want."
4,Great read!,quick read. Jensen is insightful and discusses his experience teaching in the classroom and his approach to learning and writing.
4,The Alacran Animal,"Matt is a boy. This book is the story of his life. He lives with his mother/caretaker celia.Then, these kidscome and take him to the Alacran house. Now he finds out that he is the clone of an opium lord named El Patron. All other clones have their intelligence destroyed at birth. Matt is the omnly one who didn't. they are used for implants for the original. Now he faces the problem of being a clone in a human world. Everyone hates him except Celia, El Patron, his bodygaurd Tam Lin and his friend maria. Read the book to find out more. I really liked it."
5,The House of the Scorpion,"The House Of The Scorpion is about a boy named Matteo Alacran, but some people call him Matt. And his mom is named Celia. In hte book Matt grows up and sees how life without his mother is. If you want to know what Matt dose in his life changing. And also Matt may also show how long a kid can be without his mom or dad. And Celia may not just be a great mom."
2,The House of The Scorpion,"I made Scorpion part of my advanced summer reading program because of its description and the awards it has won. The story is about the life of a boy who is a clone of a drug-lord. I think the book won the awards for the issues it raises such as morality, cloning, and prejudice rather then the quality of story or writing. I found the characters uninteresting especially the dialog. The writing did not transport me to this foreign location and time period. Overall I found the book a chore to complete. I recommend some of my other summer choices: The Book Thief, Octavian Nothing, To Kill a Mockingbird and Skellig. I really felt House of the Scorpion was a waste of my time."
4,Multiple Personality 'Perfect Spy',This is the 'Grandfather' of mind manipulation and probably inspired 'Manchurian Candidate.' Too bad so little is included about the suggestions used to access and influence the perfect spy 'personality' beyond the conscious knowledge and control of the hypnotic subject.
4,It's an Ariel watch,"If your little girl is in love with this fishy red-head you can't go wrong. Strap's leather, which is an improvement from most which are icky plastic. Not water proof,so make sure it's not on when they're swimming or in the bath/shower. Nice finish, for a kids watch I was impressed. Description says LED watch, but for the life of me I have no idea where to LED is. The thing does not light up when you push the stem. Our instructions were in japanese, so I doubt this watch is readily available in the U.S. For the hard core collectors, it does have the official holgram Disney sticker on it, if you are worried it's a knock-off."
2,more sophisticated - more simplistic,"this film takes the dangerously scheming housemaid of the 1960 B&W; original - and turns her into a ""victim"" of the rich family who hire herthis is the type of ""victim"" who at first accepts the husband into her bed despite the wife's considerate treatment of her - then eagerly welcomes himbut you shouldnt see it that way cuz the family is rich and heartless - as evidenced by their aloof manner - Western fashions - the cold empty silence of their spacious house - intruded on occasionally by the alien sounds of Western Classical musictheyre evil - so in this simpleminded universe - she must be the nice one - even the one family child loves herat least the film is technically sophisticated compared to the primative original - with suitably spare dialog - and actors who neatly fit into the 2-dimensional rolesthe characters are pawns in a screenplay - theres hardly an honest human moment thru out"
2,Not my taste,The characters were sssooo stereotypical which made it too predictable. The lessons it was trying to teach are old lessons that have been engraved on our brains.
1,Typical Korean Soap Opera Formula,"If you're familiar with Korean soap opera, then you already know the plot, the characters and the ending. It's a textbook K soap formula, but it may be entertaining for those who aren't familiar with the formula."
1,Waste of Money,This cookbook is nothing more than a list of pre-cooked and prepackaged foods you mix together. MOst of the entrees contain cream soups or some type of sauce. Salads are often canned peaches and cottage cheese. Meals are rounded out with bought rolls and a bought pie. I am very disappointed in this purchase!
2,"Not really a ""recipe"" book like I expected...","4 ingredient recipes, huh? Too many store bought heat-n-eat items listed as main dishes...it's more like a list of menus than a recipe book, though it does have some pretty simple recipes for side dishes and desserts, very few of which sound very appealing. There's something a bit stomach-turning for me to want to eat blueberry pie filling sprinkled with cookies and whipped cream as a dessert. Your taste may differ, however."
4,perfect for parties,"Very fun game to pull at parties, bbq's or rainy day fun..Doesnt hurt to have a had a nice beverage or two before playing!!!"
5,Before There Was Elvis There Was Sach,If Huntz Hall had continued his musical career he would have been the first major singing star of the 1950's. Sit back and enjoy as he sings.
4,Great Artist,"Must listen to First track ""We don't have a prayer"" sings a message that I feal is true in America today. Also very good vocals."
1,Poor Grip Magnets,These magnets are weak. They can only hold one or two sheets of paper.These are fine as chip clips. The magnets are for when the clip is NOT holding anything!The 8-pack of OXO Mini-Magnets are great.Follow this link to buy those instead:http://www.amazon.com/Oxo-Magnetic-8-Pack-Assorted-Colors/dp/B0002YTG3G
3,book review,It was interesting and had some great information but the examples of how we may become rich and stay rich were far from a secret equation. I enjoyed the book but already practice the examples presented.
5,After seeing the movie DOLPHIN TALE I fell madly in love with dolphins.,"Knowing my grandson Nate who has JD, would appreciate a dolphin to ride on, made me purchase this product. I wish I knew how to upload a photo of him riding his dolphin in his pool; so awesome...I love my grandson...& anything that makes him smile...which he did when he used his inflatable dolphin in his pool...made me smile...big time! I wish I could afford a pool to purchase the same dolphin...cause...honestly...after watching Dolphin Tale...I emphatically (spelling questionable) love dolphins too!"
4,good inflatable,I'm 17 years old and I got this for my little sister and its very easy to stay on and can hold my weight(190) I would recommend to kids 10 and over but for 9 and under they would tip.
1,NOT THE SHOW,I purchased this thinking it was the stage show how wrong !!!!I will be very carefull next time BUT it should have stated that.
1,Why did they print this book?,"this guide doesn't even have all the weapons in the players handbook. It mentions the ability of some weapons to break other weapons but never gives rules for that, and pretty much leaves out everything about all weapons except their history. the armor pictures are pretty good though, but that just isn't enough"
3,Could come in handy,"I was a bit suprised becose of the babble about every thing. Every armor has one entire page of text and another page for a drawing, still it adds a few weapons that I was suprised that were not in the Player's handbook, for an example Bolas and Caltrops"
1,Dissapointed,Seeing the quantity of 60 I assumed it was a 60 day supply. Dosing on the container was for two per day which makes this item a 30 day supply. I did not see any benefit or improvement with joint pain from the 30 day supply. I will not buy it again.
2,Why the Huge Price Increase?,"Purchased this item 01/29/08 for $14.79 per bottle to try it out. I'm feeling a little better so I decided to continue. Today, when I went to place my order, it is now $24.65 per bottle. How much will it be next time?"
5,Life saver,"I looked for these movie for so long couldn't find it anywhere in stores im so glad for resources like Amazon, quality items at discounted prizes:)."
5,"So Realistic!!!! A Have to Have,",This thing is awesome. It sounds just like an real owl. I highly recommend this to any one wanting to call in owl or just to use it as a locator call.
4,"Want to learn the deep, sensational secrets of Satanism??","Then go pick up something else. For something REAL for a change, this book delievers. There are no sensational stories in here, no ""secret Bible verses Satan hates"" or silly things like that. Just Scriptues that demonstrate the truth that Satan is a defeated enemy who is not everywhere at once. He's done a good job showing where some of the more popular rumors and theories about Angels and demons have come from. It even goes to the point of questioning the commonly-held belief of the orgins of Satan.This is not the sensationalism and rumors of Bob Larson or Mike Warnke. This is a level headed and intelligent search of the Scripture. You will think, and your view of Spiritual Warefare will be challenged (especally if you think ""Star Wars"" is Spiritual Warefare) so be forwarned!!"
4,Brief History of Chinese Civilization - Very Useful Survey,I found this a well indexed book to support a course in the History of Chinese Civilization (as a student) - easy to digest but with rich illustration of pieceds of art etc.Good text for a first year CHinese or Asian history course or for background to language and culture.
3,not rivetting but a good place to start - 3.5 stars,"In this relatively short work you will get a basic overview of the 4000 or so years of Chinese history. Schirokauer does a good job of giving a concise yet somewhat detailed account of not only Chinese history, but also developments in art, culture, religion, and philosophy. I was also pleased with his inclusion of the common people as well as emperors, generals, etc. The only problem is that this book suffers from a common problem among history textbooks; it is a bit dry. The book is not terribly written, but it took more a month to slog through b/c I frankly did not look forward to reading it even though I found the subject matter interesting and relevant (I live in the Far East). All that said this is a good place to start for a study of Chinese history. Just a bit of a slog."
2,Poorly crafted all around,"This could have been a fun movie; it was a promising concept at least. However, it falls victim to the bane of indie filmmaking; poor craftsmanship. The writing is uneven, as was the direction. The acting ranged from surprisingly good to exceptionally awful, but hovered somewhere around mediocre. The sound was decent ( a rarity in low budgets ), and the photography was pretty bad (looks like a long form student film). Overall, I'm baffled how it got to be on DVD, unless the filmmakers are doing the self-distribution thing, because the film's nothing special."
1,The Worst Movie of All Time,"My wife rented this movie last night and without a doubt this is the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot is just horrible. The acting is even worse. My favorite is the friend of Rochelle's, who is a cop, is the worst actress with a speaking part possibly of all time. Check out the uniform she is wearing. The fight scenes are just horrible fake. This movie looks like a couple of high school kids with their parents video camera and computer for editing made this."
5,the whole bag of chips,"This DVD set met and exceeded my expectations. Every episode of Zim that you ever wanted to see is found here. Not to mention the figurine of Grrr and Zim's house that nicely compliment a coffee table or flat surface of choice. If you like Zim, you have to have this.Dieses Produkt kann ich nur noch weiter empfehlen! Ist sehr witzig und hiermit kann man ziemlich gut die Langeweile vertreiben."
2,"Cardboard House, 3 in. Gir, and Crappy Extra DVD","Save your money. This is not worth it (except for true hard core fans). The DVD contains about 5 sec difference of the ""Uncut"" (fake) version of The Most Horrible Xmas Ever, Horrible Holiday Cheer (Vol. 3) DVD. Their was so crappy soundtrack of the MINIDISCs and only audio from unfinished shows (OF WHICH you COULD have downloaded 3 years ago online). And of course the interviews.It's Not Even worth $27. Just stick to the Action figures from Suncoast or DVDs from any store. The little Gir figure was cool but it's better to buy it for $14.99 at a comic book store."
5,Excellent!,"Sanaa Lathan and Wesley Snipes give this movie all the energy it needs. It's a story of love at first sight, love with problems and a man with a big ego. In other words: this movie is true to life!. I enjoyed the movie and I will own it on DVD, it's a good buy. It's too bad that is was an HBO movie, because it could have done well at the box office."
3,Disappearing Acts,I thought this was a very thoughtful black love story of its time. It was real and I recommend it to all romance fanatics especially of the African-American descent.
3,Wesley Snipes was a BAD choice for Sanaa's co-star...,"I'm not a huge Snipe's fan anyway, but I actually found myself turning away during their love scenes. Wesley just doesn't have the appeal that makes it believable that Zora would fall for him in the first place.Other than that, I thought the movie was okay. I really felt for Zora, I think Sanaa did a good job portraying the emotions and frustrations of that character. But again, it was hard to believe that she would fall for Wesley to begin with!"
4,Disappearing Acts,"If you've ever been in love with someone who was perhaps a bit out of your league and you foundd yourself constantly trying to compensate for that, then you know the rest. Wesley Snipes gives a powerful performance as a man who is a bit over his head and in love with Zora (Sanaa Lathan). Things heat up when the stakes get higher. Zora is pregnant, Franklin's out of work and their class differences become even more apparent when Zora just wants a night out on the town and Franklin just can't seem to get his act together. When the going gets tough, Franklin does a disappearing act of his own and Zora's on her own....this sounds like a familiar scenerio. The story is familiar but the ending is better. It looks like the family will make it after all. That's one for single mothers.If you're looking for a good black lover story, then ""Disappearing Acts"" is one that will leave you with a warm feeling inside and a positive feeling about love relationships."
2,What a drag,"I typically like Laura Nyro's music when it's sung by others - I find Laura herself to sound weird when she sings. That being said, I would take her versions of these songs over the ones presented on the disc. Most are so slow and dreary that they'll put you to sleep, or kill you from boredom. Why do artists these days feel the need when remaking a song, to slow it down? Laura's are slow enough!"
3,To the point,"Concise might be the best word to describe this digital test for logic overview text. Not many examples to get a beginner started, but understood for a graduate level probably. In all, boring, to the point, great to go to sleep over."
3,Intermittant Ink,"I bought these pens to use for writing checks, because they are supposed to help against check fraud. I right away noticed that the tip feels fairly fragile and since I have carbon copies under my checks, I am hesitant to apply pressure like I would with a ball point pen. So far, I haven't had any real problems with this though.Also, the ink will skip in places like a fountain pen might do, and blot in others. I guess this can be avoided if you write a little slower, and try not to stop with the pen on the paper."
2,STUPID!,I have the whole series on video and I must say this is my least favorite Puppet Master movie.This is not worth seeing.If you loved Puppet Master 4 then you should check this out otherwise stay away from this movie.This movie is the same as Puppet Master 4.Toulon's Puppets battle the killer Totems.
2,same stuff compiled,"agree on Sphinx comments by other readers. What's the big deal ? it was obviously a big rock that by a freak of nature looked like a lion laying down ... then eroded away. Later, a pharoah came along and recarved the head to look like him when he built a pyramid. It is obvious because ... the sphinx's head is far too small proportionally for the body, and the feet are way too big for the body too. Everything else in Egypt is perfectly proportioned and carved (including 3 massive perfectly proportioned pyramids nearby) ... except the no.1 icon the sphinx ????... its a no-brainer (yes I've been there).all these books are much the same - ancient people were every bit as smart as us now ... they just didn't have petrol and electricity ... could you image our modern ""advanced"" society if overnight we switched off the energy sources ... we'd be back in ""prehistory"" ourselves overnight ... and it wouldn't be ""mysterious"""
4,A great series--but where's the rest,"I've loved this series on PBS and was delighted to see the DVD's of series one here on Amazon. Still just as funny and delightfully entertaining as it was several years ago (when I saw it last on PBS).But where are the rest of the season? And French Fields, the follow up series? The series deserves FIVE STARS, but without the full set one is left wanting much more...."
3,A Waste of Time and Money,"It will will take you 3.5 hours to put this thing together. The universal ""picture book"" instructions for assembly could use improvement. Mine were blurry and hard to understand, especially when trying to decipher the shape/differences of smaller parts. Speaking of parts, there are too many. The wall panels could be wider. The block holes are not deep enough in some areas to ensure a secure fit. The base panels I had were slightly warped. My 6 year old played with this for 5 minutes and it collapsed. The only positive side is the accessories that come with it. My son likes all the figures and aliens that came with it, thus distracting him long enough for me to get rid of the outside wall panels and at least salvage the inner lab. I don't want to try to construct this again and don't plan to buy anymore products from Mega Blocks with this many pieces."
5,"Funniest, most engaging book I read in the 1980s!","I lost this book after lending it to countless friends, and I've thought of it often over the past decade. It is fiercely feminine, while it retains its femininity; the story makes you laugh even as you feel Eva's longing and pain. Her mother and her lover are real, flawed and entirely believable. And, above all, women get a sense of perspective on the things we THINK we want and those we don't. I've never felt this way about a character, and I've read MANY books. After all these years, I miss my brave yet scared; religous yet irreverent; funny and articulate Eva.Someone out there please bring her back."
4,fun fun and bad,we loved the whale when we blew it up but in 5 days a small whole appeared but we cleared it up with a patch kit so it still is fun
1,To smelly 4 me..,"I have sensitivities to perfumes and such. They always have a sample of some kind of cologne or something like that. They should be more considerate than to bomb you with these disgusting smells when you have allergies to them. Even when you tear out the mess, the whole magazine smells and it gets all over everything. Have an unscented version. But it's too late anyway. They burned this bridge by NOT thinking of it before I got sick from it."
4,Great Magazine,"I have had no problems with the service of delivery. The magazine is good article wise but there are a ton of advertisements, but what magazine isn't like that any more."
3,As expected,"Like: low price.Dislike: thin, repeated sex articles, uninteresting ads.Esquire has become lower end magazine for man compared to GQ magazine.Still, a good magazine for the price."
4,Gift,"Gave this as a gift to my best guy friend heard nothing but good reviews except for one complaint, sometimes pages are too cluttered with articles and type is annoying to read. He's 28, so I can imagine that would bother some older readers. He loves the content and sends me a picture every time an issue arrives. Great gift!"
1,Never received an issue,Ordered the magazine in August 2011 and still waiting to receive a single issue. I have tried getting the problem resolved through email with the publisher but with no results. Will be asking for a refund of my subscription.
1,where is it?,It must be VERY difficult to put a name on a list and put something in the mail. I got two subscriptions via Amazon and neither has arrived yet. Very frustrating.
1,Pure socialist propaganda!,"Boy, this magazine has sure changed since I subscribed 20 years ago. Since I now have more time for reading I thought I'd try it again. What a mistake! The first issue I received was loaded to the gills with slavish adulation disguised as articles about all of our progressive socialist rulers. You can get the same fawning puppy love for fascism at the Daily Kos website and it won't cost you anything. After all, why should you reward the haters of capitalism with your capital?"
1,Never received my order,"I ordered Esquire 4 months ago, I had contact Hearst publishing 3 times that I had not received the magazine and wanted to cancel. It took until 3 days ago to get a refund and that was when I had Amazon get involved. I will never order from Hearst publishing again. Should have read the feedback a little closer."
5,This Is the One,"Of all 20 of the CDs I have bought for meditation and hypnosis this is the one that stood out. It's very easy to follow, with no difficult visualizations, but a deep and wonderful hypnotic state is acquired. I put this on my MP3 player and now anytime I have an emotional pain in my mind I go right to this CD and it is erased, and replaced with a calming peace and emotional control. Janet is amazing and I hope she makes many more CDs. Thank You!"
4,"I didn't like them too much, but they might be good for your style.",They had too much of a metal sound to them. They didn't last as long as some of my others. Still decent strings if you like that sound.
2,Another Dissapointing Remake,I am big Retro gammer like many of you i like the arcade games of the past but when these companies make these classic collections or anniversary collections all you need is one however thats not the case here again . Namco makes there Namco museum a couple of years ago for the Ps2 and others its great 12 great games . Now with this anniversary collection you get 14 games and the two bonus games one that has already been on the previous collection pacmania and galaga 88 which is great. The other so called new games Suck and the Loading time of these games is slow. Just Dissapointing
5,Games for me,I enjoy playing old games it bring back memories when i was younger and like it a whole i wish it have so many games that some times me and my husband plays all day
1,Worthless for rugby,"Basic weight training information and program, nothing you cant find for free and better online. However if you want a compact program in your hands its a good starter. Don't buy this however if you actually want to have workouts specific to your position in rugby. I've never taken a look at the other books in this series, but i suspect that the workouts are almost all the same across any of the books( ulitmate guide to... football, cycling, etc). Really not worth the money for anyone who has experience in weightlifting or is looking to scrummage better, tackle harder or have a quicker sidestep"
2,Quality roller?,"Not the world's greatest quality. If you don't wash these out thoroughly and let dry, you better like hairy walls, because that's what you're going to get."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This book is a poor reprint of an original book by Braymer. They have changed the title and have not given frontspiece credit to the original. It is reduced in size, picture reproduction is poor, and the reproduction quality is so poor that it is hard to read. Binding is poor and pages fall out. For about the same price, you can get original copies of Braymer's excellent ""Rewinding Samll Motors"" and ""Armature Winding and Motor Repair, second edition"" through the used book market."
2,looks cheap,"I thought it looked very cute and sparkly from the picture, but it looks really cheap and flaky type of material when I got it -- very disappointed. And it didnt feel very comfortable either. I've had better product from Kenzie. I returned mine."
3,"Like a good conversation,","the author keeps you interested, and mixes just the right amount of humor into the work. Unfortunately, pre-60s horror movies, he seldom backs up his arguments, instead claiming something to be obviously homosexual and then describing the plot. While I admit, it is very easy to interpret some of these works as homosexual, and I know it would be difficult to find much evidence outside a James Whale movie, he relys primarily on circumstantial evidence to defend himself. (References and evidence are two different things.) Throughout the work, he makes interesting points which are well thought out, I'm glad I purchased it...but as it is, the book doesn't amount to more than a great conversation with somebody."
1,Nerve Surpport Formula,"I have Neuropathy form chemo therapy. To say the least it is very very unpleasant. I tried NSF for a month to no avail. I kept in contact with the company by email support and they kept saying increase the dose which I did a number of times. It did nothing for me. I took the whole bottle in 3 weeks or less time. Not one sign it was improving. So I tried and it was a waste of my money. Do your research, there are far cheaper and better result products out there. I will give you 1, Take B-6 in the form of Benfotimine 450/500mg per day along with Glutimine powder 4500mg 2x a day. Research it. You maybe surprised.NSF is just too expensive and if it doesn't work they tell you to just keep increasing the dosage, you would end up buying a min. of 3 bottles a month and that is very costly. Good luck."
1,preying on the desperate,"Chronic pain is debilitating, disabling, depressing. Already in a sorry state that isdifficult to combat, it is unhelpful to be tempted, out of sheer desperation, to buynearly anything for relief, regardless of cost. Seven years of 24/7 neuropathic footpain has brought me experiences including accupuncture, biofeedback, infra-red treaments,chiropractic and finally back surgery. None of these and none of the anti-depressantmedications relieved the symptoms and certainly didn't fix the problem. It was toosimple to believe a bottle of capsules could do more, but I bought them with hope.After consuming three bottles of these pills at a fast-paced escalation in amounttaken, I concluded they are worthless. All cases are different I realize, but if youhave any budget concerns, don't waste your money on these."
5,Nerve Support Formula helps me,"I have permanent nerve damage that runs from my low back all the way down my right leg. I have severe chronic pain all the time. I was looking for an holistic medication to help with the neuropathy I was experiencing in my leg (pins and needles, burning sensations, crawling sensations, etc) I take 4 Nerve Support Formula pills twice a day and that really helps. I do not have the neuropathy as long as I use this medication. I choose holistic medications because I do not like the side effects that come with the medications my doctor prescribes. This medication has made a big difference in pain management- I will continue to use this medication!"
1,BOMBARDED BY AGGRAVATING SALES CALLS!!! DO NOT PURCHASE!!,"Let the product do the talking and if it works people will continue to purchase it. Instead this company feels as if they need to call you multiple times to try and persuade you to purchase more. I haven't even had a chance to see if the product works yet, but I'm receiving multiple sales call. I promise, if this product works I'll order more and maybe raise my rating but for now please stop calling me."
2,After race,"How does one get ""after whiteness""? I thought that there was no such thing as race since race is a social construct and not a biological one; or does that only count when white is the racial label. I thought that we had moved beyond racial stereotypes and that we were a multicultural society but this must not be the case. What part of so-called white culture is so offensive to the author and what does he want to replace it with?White culture isn't about being a particular color but about a way of life, a society found on the rule of law, the right to practice or not practice a religious faith, freedom of expression and association, freedom of the press-sound familiar?"
5,Great tricycle,"My twin boys received this tricycle for their 2nd birthday. After reading many on-line reviews of various tricycles, I decided to go with Kettler's Supertrike I. I have not regretted my decision. My boys loved this tricycles from the moment they laid eyes on them. They ride them every single day. I can not say enough about how great they are. By the time they are 5, they'll be ready for a big boy bike. These tricycles will accomadate them until that age. If you are looking for a good tricycle with an excellent price tag, this product is for you."
5,One of the best ever,"I first read this book as a teenager and have read it about once a decade since. Holds up time after time, with characters I will never forget. I may be a bit prejudiced since I grew up in the area, but he gets it right. This book should find it's way back into print, but I'm glad to see there are still affordable used copies out there."
5,Wonderful moving video,This a wonderful look into a man who had a great effect on the world in general and on music. His words offered Peace and Pride for all people and nations. He will not be forgotten. He is a hero not only to Jamaica but to the world. This video is a dedication to the man and his music which I believe will always keep him and his message to the world alive. It is amazing that a man who was on earth such a short time-gave us so much.
2,commercial light pop music made by producers not artists,"most of the comments state that this a mixture of arabic and spanich music, some even say Rai and Flamenco...This is definitely not it! this is pop music with very little artistic or musical inovation, using common scales and harmonies common to both arabic and spanish music. If you think that Gypsy King is flamenco music than you would probably like this CD. It is pretty danceable and appropriate for a night club or a dance class. However, if your musical taste is somewhat more discerning or sophisticated, this CD will rapidly loose its charm. For something a bit more substantial check out Ilham Al Madfai or Radio Tarifa. both these groups draw on the convergence of arabic and spanich music. You might also want t o check the real Rai from the ""king of Rai"", Khaled ( 1,2,3 soleil,a live performance with a couple other rai singers is especially good)"
1,Don't waste your Money,"Don't waste your money on this movie. It might be rare, but the quality is horrible. Waxy and blurry, and some parts are very dark. There is no digital remastering done to this film. Definitely not DVD quality."
2,Reeses sugar-free peanut butter cups,"I like the product.However, it took quite a while before we got them.As a result the Peter buttercups themselves were melted.They are still edible, and good.They are hard to open though because they melted. The school"
3,I sure got STIFFED a few months back,"I bought a pair of these and their tennis socks just a couple months back and paid a whopping $15 each. Now these are $11 and the tennis socks are $10. I will say these are very good socks, very soft and comfortable after a few washings. The tennis socks are crap though. The balled up with lint and are falling apart. I can't wear them with shorts because they look s__ty and feel as bad.I would recommend these at the now $11 price. They are very comfortable for walking or hiking."
4,Great socks as always.,"Bought some of these about five years ago and loved them. I inspect trails for a parks dept and wear them everyday. Bought three new pairs to replace my old ones which are now becoming my house socks. After five years of abuse still no holes, but the elastic won't cut it on the trails anymore. Also I am allergic to wool, so these are the best thing I have found without wool."
5,"Great Hiking socks, lasts forever",I have Thorlo socks I bought in the late 90s and wear regularly. Great quality comfort and durability. They are expensive but are well worth it because they've outlasted two wives! I'm getting some more now because they're finally getting threadbare after over 10 years of use and perhaps hundreds of washes. You gotta love that.
4,Great product,"I've used Thorlo products for years, my son has taken up hiking in the ADK Montains and I bought these for him based on the great luck I've always had with Thorlo products. It's a gift for Christmas."
5,A great little gem of a movie.,"I rank Late for Dinner as one of my all time favorites. I discovered this movie years ago when I worked the counter at my sister's video store. I popped it in just for something to watch one evening. I'm glad I did. I waited patiantly for the DVD release but it never came, I had a VHS transfer copy which was ok but the quality was sub-par. When I heard about Amazon's manufactured on demand dervice, I was kinda hesitant about ordering Late for Dinner. I just didn't want another VHS transfer. I just received and watched it and it is supurb. Almost DVD quality picture. Now I'm waiting for a blue-ray release.LOL I love this movie that much."
3,Simple but cute,Never head about this film; I just came across it. Has the makings of something much better but unfortunately fell short.
1,Come on now...,"I read through this book in the store and did find it to have some good info, but the other review in here goes way overboard. It seems like this person is talking about the bible and not this book. The review states this book is ""a must-read"", ""an invaluable learning tool, as well as a must-keep guide for future reference"", ""an inspiring (yet mindful of pitfalls) strategy-packed book"", and ""leaves you wondering why he revealed all his secrets. ""Listen, if this is the author or some friend of theirs making this review, please don't insult our intelligence by making such a blatantly false review. This book may have some merit, but it's not the best thing since sliced bread."
2,Don't waste your time,"This books reads like a first year english paper. The author is more interested in exploring his nascent writing skills, that he forgets that someone will actually have to read it.If only the author actually got to the point and described what he calls ""Ultra Solutions"" in a manner that wasn't so annoying, this would be an ok book. The content is potentially interesting, but is wrapped in so much fluff that I found it impossible to finish the book."
4,Fine player,"The display is incredible. The animated movies that the kids mostly watch come across the screen with remarkable detail.On the down side: With the speakers on the side of the screen (not below), finding a case/car mounting system that would accomodate its width was difficult. I did finally find one at Bestbuy that only took slight modifications. As other have said, this player does not resume play after returning power to unit. So turning off the car and then returning, you start at the beginning of the show or mess with it to find where you left off. Lastly, louder volume would be nice.Still a nice player with a nice slim design. The battery is designed nice too (good for 3+ hours new). I mention the negatives, because they are the main reason I look at reviews."
5,Great stuff,Another great product from Barry Farms. Makes wonderful flour when put through the coffee mill!
2,Bottom of the Barrel?,These seeds were accompanied by small broken pieces of seed that just make the bag weigh 1 pound but the water is cloudy at rinsing and doesn't germinate. They sift their way to the bottom of the barrel and should be thrown out. They are included to weigh a full pound with pieces that should not be included. I have been growing wheatgrass for over 15 years. I will not buy these seeds again.
5,"""That dog will hunt""","I too saw the concert on Directv and was blown away by the sound, the energy and the pure showmanship of both the band and the kids. I also had reservations about an orchestra and a rock band, but in this case it works. You have a new and refreshed Collective Soul with the amazing talent and energy of the Atlanta Youth Orchestra combining into one outstanding show. My wife and I bought the dvd for my college aged daughter. It arrived yesterday. You think she'll notice the warpping off of the case? LOL"
5,Brilliant Show!,"I also had the chance to watch some (about 7 songs) of this concert on DirectTV and it was excellent! I wanted to purchase the DVD immediately, but I knew it would be a while before being released for sale.I must admit that, when I learned a few weeks ago that this DVD was going to be released, I was somewhat skeptical about the symphony accompanying the band. I guess it was because I really disliked the Metallica-with-symphony concert. But I tell you, Collective Soul with the symphony was brilliant! I get goose bumps from just thinking about it. And it makes it much cooler to see that the members of the symphony are kids!I can't wait!"
5,Spray gun filters,Handy to have if you want to change between what you are spraying colr wise or between a paint and a stain. works excellent with a solid stain
5,Excellent deal on Duracells,"Was amazed to find Duracells for such low price. Batteries came in very organized zip lock bag not Duracell packaging, but who cares? I just tear batteries out of Duracells pretty package and pitch it anyway, so don't let the reviews about packaging sway you from a great deal. Installed 9 batteries in LED flashlights, and even though the lights had good batteries in them the Duracells nearly doubled the light output. Faster than projected shipping too. Thanks alot."
5,Tycho and Kepler,An amazing and inspirational account of one of the greatest stories in the history of science. Extremely well written and scholarly. I have average reading skills but at times found the book impossible to put down. In spots I had to stop reading it because emotions took over. The best book I ever read about the classical scientists.
3,Ending lacking,It ended very abruptly. Made you wonder how it would end.Not satisfied with that ending. Maybe a sequel is planned
1,Boring,The storyline sounded so promising. But it just is not believable that the protagonist would react the way she did upon finding another woman with her husband's name. I found the pace slow and my attention kept wandering. Life is to short to waste on a poorly written book.
3,A TRICK OF LIGHT,"It took awhile to get into this novel but once I did I liked it.But I was surprised at the way it ended. I wanted it to be different.Two differnt worlds. two different families, one husband and fatherliving a lie. One wife also living a lie.As for the ending...you have to read the novel to find out."
2,Shallow characters and monotonous reading,I found myself skipping pages even when bored to death on the treadmill. Story seems to go nowhere for most of this book.
1,Not what expected,I returned this because I thought from the title it was the purple cow poems but it was more reprints of old newsprint stories.
1,Careful...you might not get the item displayed in the photo,"I ordered this expecting to get the Mad Scientwists Raspberry Reaction that's shown in the photo, but instead received Invisible Raspberry. I was going to use the Kool-aid to dye yarn, but obviously cannot use the invisible flavor to do so.--Just a warning to anyone who's planning on purchasing the item for anything other than drinking it (I'm sure it tastes great!)"
4,Madamme x,My mother recommended this movie to me I had never heard of it before and as she had outlined the story line I was keen to see it for myself and I was not disappointed it has a good story line and held my attention all the way through thoroughly recommended for people who like older movies.I rate it as a 4 star movie.
5,Grande Ecole,"This film has a great storyline, trivial and complicated just as life is, which makes itself so realistic that you will easily enter into some characters and feel the fluctuation. The director did an excellent job, putting all fragments together and reveal them properly. Really love it.The front cover could have better one"
5,It should have more than five stars,"This is a wonderful film that deals beautifully with same sex relationships while social and racial barriers exist. Although it is set in France, it can apply to all countries where same sex relationships could be curtailed as a result of pressure from the outside. The director deals with the subject in a way that leaves the audience yearning for the two main subjects to solidify their relationship and live happily ever after. I have watched the film many times and with each viewing I learn something new from the rich storyline and screenplay. Also, the DVD extras are very informative and are a useful insight into the minds of the actors and director. I look forward to seeing more films by this director, Robert Salis and also the young French-Algerian actor, Salim Kechiouche."
5,Amazing product,"This cable is the best DVI to HDMI cable I have used yet. I'm currently using it to write this review on my LCD TV. The connectors are sturdy and have good construction, and the plug casings are tough as well. The plug casings are small enough to be used even in tight port places like on my laptop, and the rubber coating on them makes them easy to grip and identify when reaching behind things.Video quality is great and it does exactly what the description says it will. And of course it ships with the connector covers for when you're not using it."
3,"works, but spins too fast","I purchased this mixer after borrowing a similar one from a fellow airbrush artist. His version spun slower though allowing to mix paint nicely in 1oz cups. this model, or at least the one I received spins way to fast for a 1oz cup and causes messy situations. I've been trying to slow it down but haven't succeeded, I guess I'll have to wait for the batteries to die down."
3,Everyone doesn't have to be Coltrane...,"Mindi Abair's new CD is may be classified in the ""Light Fluff"" section of the Jazz Genre, but it's Fun Light Fluff. I think the CD succeeds in being exactly what it is intended to be -- fun songs that are easy to listen to. And there is a place for that, just like there's a place for Coltrane, Parker, et al. They aren't the same and aren't supposed to be..."
3,Every Waking Moment?,I have just recently found Brenda Novak as a new author to read.This was my second book of hers.......the first kept me reading till the end.......this one .....found a little boring....kept putting it down.....and re-reading pages.....till I finished the book. Have looked up other books she written and will give them a try.
1,THEY ARE OUT OF STOCK,It would be great if a company could update their inventory so that consumers like myself don't waste our time for 4 days after placing an order only to find out it is indefinitely out of stock...if that's so..then why doesnt it say that on the amazon? So annoying
4,Surprised by the quality,"I bought this cd mainly for Bobby Kimballs vocals, but was surprised by the quality of the ""classic rock orchestra"". It is strange hearing Bobby sing songs he didn't originally do with the band. I love this guys voice, so controlled, yet soulful and powerful. And the orchestra really rocks with a stomping bass drum sound which I did not expect and some ripping guitar riffs (although not as 'up front' as in a Toto recording) also!Highlights for me are, Out of love; I'll be over you, and my favorite, Isolation. There is also a great version of One day at a time, one of the songs not on the cd packaging along with the LRB song Cool change.This (as someone has already said) is not Toto, but its very, very good and you will not be disappointed in purchasing this title.Darren Quilliam"
4,Buy It,I bought this for the movie Something New and the other movies were a bonus and for the price where do you go wrong?Sometimes you just want a luv story that isnt too corny and this will do the trick.Deliver Us From Eva you have to like one main women who steers the other women which drives their men nuts and they hire a man to date Eva who after some jabs from her does settle her down and falls for her.
5,Deep Understanding of the Anomaly,"The information in this book is profoundly informative and gives insights, viewpoint to clear up vagueness in the parables of Jesus. Now I understand what Jesus was talking about, what Jesus was about.Jesus was an anomaly, difficult to classify, but people constantly pidgen hole Jesus to conform to their viewpoint. To see what he was really about is enlightening. Jesus knew what was wrong with people but people generally do not want to know what is wrong with them. This is why this book is not on the best seller list, because people really do not want to know the turth. The truth is like the weather, knowing what it is, is frustrating, for there is nothing you can do about it. Often when one says ""I see!"" they stand lonely looking at the sight they enjoy, all alone. That must have been how Jesus felt especially in his last hours."
2,Sad White Balance,"This was my first DSLR camera so it was wonderful as it launched me in to a love of photography and launched my career as a photographer, however through learning my camera and pictures, I found the camera's white balance to be very poor. All of my tungsten shots were VERY yellow and the custom white balance does not give much help. Also, because Pentax's nicest camera that they make is the K5 (as of 2011) if you ever decide to go beyond that, you will be locked into Pentax lenses. I'd suggest starting with a Canon or Nikon which will give you a wider choice of lenses and cameras once you outgrow this one...which will happen quickly."
4,Happy so far,"Bought the K100D Super to use with my Pentax lenses from a ZX-30 35mm camera(also a great camera). After about a month of use, I am very happy so far. Huge difference in image quality and flexibility over my old HP Photosmart 730. Color and shapness are great and LCD screen is easy to see, even in sunlight. Have used a 300mm zoom and 2x converter on wildlife and pics are excellent. Would give it 5 stars, except I have only had it a month. Andy"
3,Not for me,"This may be ideal in some situations. I am a very visual learner. I had trouble with all the auditory input. I thought it would be easier to learn with this program as it broke away from traditional language learning, starting with grammar. As I already speak Spanish and French, in addition to English, I wanted to be able to connect this onto what I already knew. Entire sentences thrown at me verbally was basically incoherent to me. Had an entire transcript been available, even as a supplement on the Simon & Schuster website, breaking down the sentences, I might have enjoyed this more. I guess it's back to Rosetta Stone, which is essentially the same price anyway!"
5,The best way learn German,"I've been trying for years to become semi fluent in German. All of my previous efforts have gone down in flames. The Pimsleur series is fantastic. You learn the language by speaking the language. Complex grammár becomes second nature. I'm halfway through the Second part of the course. I've been working on it during my commute to work. Makes the commute almost bearable. I'll be going to Berlin in a couple of weeks. Feel as though I'll be able to communicate reasonably well.You won't get a huge vocabulary using the Pimsleur method. But, what you do learn will become part of you. You will know how to use the words in complex sentences. You will know how to use similar words as you learn them. You will learn practical words that can be used in everyday conversations.The series of lessons is not cheap. However, 'the Pinsleur series is worth every penny. Buy it!"
5,Worth not skipping school for,"Had there been courses like this during my college days I definitely would have skipped less and made it to class more often. What a well researched book that managed to balance fact and opinion quite nicely. A lot of that has to do with the person teaching the class. Sanchez has certainly earned his PhD in Van Halen. He comes across like that cool teacher you had growing up. The one who could crack jokes, play concert videos for you on fridays, and smoke out with you if you ran into him at a concert. The EVH tribute was the obvious choice for highlight, and it's amazing, but I equally loved where Kevin Dubrow was talking about the club days on the sunset strip. I'm embarrased to say it but I never knew Quiet Riot and VH came from the same scene. Reading about it blew me away. Kevin's memories of those early days are incredible, especially how he and Randy Rhoads went to VH shows together. Guys and gals if you love Van Halen you will love this book."
5,Simply beautiful!,"I first came across these salt crystal candle lights in Germany during a visit with my family a few years ago. I thought they were beautiful, but way too heavy to take back with me in my suitcase and quite expensive, too. So I was happy to see one on the Friday Sale for $13.78 and I ordered it right away. When it arrived, I put it in front of my fireplace. It is heavy enough so that the cats won't knock it over during one of their cat fits, and it emits a beautiful glow when lit after dark. Best of all, my husband thinks it is beautiful and somehow soothing - I love it!"
2,Tarp,The tarp was very stiff and had fold creases that won't come out. Overall was not very satisfied and would not order this again but it is not worth the postage to return it.
5,It gives Chicken Soup for Teens a run for their money.,"As a co-author to this book, I must admit I am biased. But, I would not have gotten involved if I did not think this is a book every teen must have. With a collection of youth speakers from across the United States, it is a collection of hilarious and touching stories from a variety of very different authors. This is the original in a series of four and it truly helps teens get the power to do what is positive. If you have any questions, just email me!"
4,Wonderful -- I read it in 8 hours!,"Much better than I thought it would be. Reminds me of John Fante's LA novels, only displaced in time. Authentic and true-to-life, even in the absurdest moments. There's nothing here that rings false. And, it has the heart we've come to expect when the name Farrelly is on it -- all the heart and absurdity one expects from someone named Farrelly.Thanks for writing this, Peter! I hope you'll do more novels someday!"
2,Disappointing,"A disappointing novel from the man who ostensibly wrote Something About Mary. Despite ""comedy"" in the title, there are few laughs and the comic situations the main character finds himself in are not particularly original. If you're looking for some meaty black humor or a book that really skewers the Hollywood industry, look elsewhere. It's moronic fluff from a man who should, theoretically, be capable of better things."
5,Prelife crisis story - makes you laugh at him and yourself.,"Farrelly gives hope to ""late bloomers"" that always thought, ""I can make it in Hollywood..."" the only difference is that he has really has a unique talent.Besides being a real knee slapper, its comforting to know that other people have the same quirky feelings, idiosyncracies and wacked out habits. I respect the story for what it is, autobiographical. It seems like it will be a great low budget movie some day. The neighbors, the crazy women, the agents all help create a real L.A. feel, be it slimey at times. God bless Peter Farrelly for admitting (even if he doesn't say its totally autobiographical) his masterbation habits. Great freaking read."
4,Good quick pictoral history,This book is a great pictoral history of San Diego's Gaslamp Quarter. It also serves as a great walking guide with pictures and history of the buildings still in the Gaslamp today.
3,Awake hypnosis,You are asked to remain awake or it will not work. Then she puts you to sleep. Hard to stay awake. The reader has a great voice and aspires to none of the breathy unintelligible nonsense one finds on discs of this ilk. I recommend it only if you are determined to work with it over a period of time.
1,I can't recall a thing,i gave the cd away to good will they were worthless to me. I felt she sould improve on the voice tone and the music choice. I can't self hynosis is a bunch of bull i was never relaxed at all. I did everything the tape said to do and i got nothing out of it.
1,Flawed design,"The other reviewers are correct. The filter will not fit over the intake flange. After I attempted to install the filter for over an hour, the over $50 filter callapsed as I tried to push it on. Threw it in the trash and ordered an OEM filter from Sonnen Porsche (http://www.porscheoemparts.com/partlocator/index.cfm?action=getJointLocator&siteid=215405)for $28. I've used K&N filters for many years without issue. Too bad K&N will not admit their error and redesign this flawed product."
1,Do not buy this for your Boxster,"Tried for 3 hours to fit this in my 2008 Boxster. K&Ns; are great and I have been using them for over 10 years now. The design on this filter is such that the ""sleeve"" end of the filter is made of flexible rubber which will NOT slip onto the air duct of your Porsche Boxster. I called K&N; and they gave me a reference number ""QA53566"" but did not own up to the fact that their design is flawed. The picture of this filter on the website does not show the intake side of the filter.This is not about just a one time install as with K&N; filters, one should remove, clean, oil charge and re-install quite frequently......even more often on performance vehicles to get the full benefit of good airflow.Good luck if you get this product.....I was not so lucky with this one.....suggest sticking to original Porsche filter."
4,Good reference text,This is one of the many texts I used as references. The author's style really set himself apart. Quite a useful book.
4,The Raid,This movie is almost pure action from the start to finish with an interesting ending. If you are into martial arts action type movies you will love this one!!!
5,Well worth watching,"If you like guns, martial arts, and alot of punch to the face, then you will not be disappointed in watching this show."
4,Rollercoaster ride of excitement,This was an exciting movie from about 5 minutes into the movie. I like action flicks. This was a hell of a ride.Must see.
3,KICK BUTT FIGHT SCENES!!!,I didn't care much for the story line or the acting. But I did throughly enjoy the fight scenes!!! I was exhausted just watching the kick butt fight scenes!!!
3,A movie for the action kungfu types out there.,"I am a big fan of these over the top ""one man against an army"" type flicks and this one was a good watch. As in all movies of this type the plot is a little weak. But the real show is the fighting. And theres lots and lots of it. Bought this one as a gift for a friend of mine that also likes these type of flicks."
5,Action packed!!!,Not a movie for everyone but if you love some action and amazing fighting this one's for you! It even has a decent story line.
1,"Very contrived, cliched with poorly executed action scenes","That is quite an accomplishment. The movie was the lousiest martial arts demonstration I'd ever seen. You will cringe as you see opponents appearing on cue to get beat up in awfully staged scenes. The plot, if there was one, is extremely contrived and unbelievable. The SWAT team in this movie is officially the world's worst. I mean, really, they had no backup? This movie has been massively overhyped and overrated on the web, and I find it all very dubious indeed.Supposedly, there are plans to do an American remake. I really hope this doesn't happen, as this, the original film, was just terrible to begin with. There's a reason the film did not get wide distribution.This may be great for young teens interested in mindless cartoon action, but for adults, 20 minutes may be all that they can stand.Also, does anyone know what the Redemption part had to do with the movie? Way to pretentiously add it on to the American version!!!"
5,Best Action Flick of All Time,Only in a foreign country do they get away with these kinds of stunts. Non-Stop urban combat and martial arts.
2,"Lots of pretty cool action, lousy movie.","I think my title says it all. There is a lot of action and some of it is on par with some of the better I've seen but it is such a horrible movie I'm not sure it swayed me (just my opinion) much. I was going to have some of the guys over to watch it on my home theater set-up, but after watching it I decided to save them the torture.Didn't like this movie at all!"
3,"Good movie but,",It's isn't English only subtitles. Really wish there was an English spoken version but its okay just read a lot
2,not told,They show in pictures two covers but only received one would have been nice to know that if you wanted a pair you needed to order two
2,One of the worst textbooks I've had to read,"I agree with those who said this book is badly written and jumps around too much. I was interested in the topic before taking a class centered around this book, but the combination of the teacher (who was one of the reviewers cited in the book) and the textbook have made me allergic to the topic.This book is not well organized. Due to its structure (which my teacher followed) we were often asking our professor whether he was on China or Japan because it was rarely clear. The writing is not smooth or remotely enjoyable to read. The content seemed somewhat random and you in no way get a feel for any of the periods or civilizations in a visceral or relatable way. I also agree with those who said there was too much emphasis on the art for an introductory text. This book is dry and fulfills all the negative stereotypes about history textbooks. If possible, avoid it."
4,35mm projector,Projector allowed viewing slides made in Korea in 1960.Great deal arrived in time as stated. Like new still in orignal box with instructions.Now am lookin for additionals bulbs for spares.
3,"Good, but not great","This is a good solid collection of information about Michigan hiking trails, and the three that I've actually walked were accurately depicted in the book. I've only given it three stars because the presentation is a bit lacking. Everything is in black and white and this genre practically demands some full-color photos and graphics."

2,Buy Crystalairs or Roomates.Leave Frankie On The Shelf,"The backround music seems like it is played on one of those electronic keyboards.not my style of doo wop.....if you like ""neo doo wop"" buy The roomates or/and the Crystalairs"
5,Recommended,This book is wonderful! The school guidance counselor recommended several books out of the series for us to use at home to help our 9 yr. old deal with some issues. The pictures are engaging and the words are easy enough for our child to read and understand. We have seen a huge improvement in behavior by all of us using the tools provided. The fact that he reads along with us when we read it to him and will pick the book up and read it himself speaks volumes to me. We have loaned this book and others from the series to friends but always make sure we get it back. This is not a book that will go missing from our house!
3,Mom Needs a Break,"Maybe Ellie needs a break from the twins. This book plods rather than waltzes. Cannell's usual sparkle is missing, and Ellie's character is somewhat anemic, showing little of her usual goofy charm. The ending is Victorian mush, which may appeal to some, but seemed overdone to me. Spring tonic? Vacation in Mazatlan? Let's hope that the next Cannell outing shows more spunk. In this one, Roxie rules."
5,Good book,My Husband actually likes these books and he is 40. He is a big fan of Star Wars (not to the point of collecting SW items) and likes to read most of the spin offs. He said that these books are written pretty good.
4,Pretty Good,Bought it because I wanted to have more options than just bleu cheese on my low carb diet. Taste surprisingly good and no funny after taste. Bacon flavor is light and the base is very rich and creamy.
3,Slightly updated but with several mistakes.,This book is a mere revised version of the previous volume. It has several places in the book that still refers to things in Maya 4.5 that have changes in 5. It is still a good refernce book even if some of the web links no longer work.
3,okay,an okay book but if your looking for a clean book for your teen look somewhere else. some swearing and a little innuendo. if your looking for a historical fiction on napoleon however this is great. i really love napoleon now.
3,finally - what?,"for quite some years, we haven't heard anything from them. and now they are back, finally? well for a true fan, maybe. but be aware of this: most of the tracks are from the last album 'heaven'. and several of these songs don't belong to a best of. while some of the great songs aren't there at all. some new songs have made it to this cd and they are really great for any u 96 fan, really!If you are a fan who haven't bought all their album, then you must buy this one. but if you, like me, have all their previous albums, then don't! all you get from this is 'heaven' all over again and a few new tracks, and an extra-cd that basicly is one large track (21 minutes?) with old hits that mostly are on the best of.This cd proves only one thing, u 96 are almost spelling it out for us: we're history, we have nothing new to give you, therefore we'd like to give out our 'best' songs one more time so that you wont forget us."
5,An important book,"After 8 years of scientific higher education culminating in a veterinary medical degree, I feel cheated for not having been exposed to Denton's ideas. Prideful scientists will not like Denton's challenge to the predominant paradigm, but his case is compelling and needs to be heard. His eye-opening critique needs to be widely read if science is to live up to its charge in the scientific method. I can't recommend it highly enough."
1,Crisis? What crisis?,"I am a professional in the life sciences and I can unequivocally state that there is no crisis in evolutionary biology. On the contrary, this is an exciting time to be studying evolution, with new fossil discoveries from China and elsewhere, as well as new evidence from molecules and genes of living organisms, giving us a clearer idea both of how living and extinct organisms are related, and how evolution has produced the myriad forms that it has. There is a very good reason why evolution is virtually universally accepted by biologists to explain the patterns seen in biology. Darwin's theories have been modified and expanded upon but never overthrown by modern biology. There simply are no other theories to explain the patterns seen in living organisms and in the fossil record."
5,A good thinking book on evolutionary theory and its shortcom,"I appreciated Denton's frankness in admitting problems with evolutionary theory. He saw the problems, recognized that evolutionary theory fails passing the scrutiny, and willingly admitted that although the theory is far from able to explain many well known facts, e.g., pass-through bird lungs versus bellows lungs of mammals and reptiles, he knew of no scientifically satisfactory answer to origins. Since I am a creationist, I was disappointed that he didn't feel that creation was a viable option. If science cannot allow a supernatural explanation, especially on the issue of origins, especially when intelligent design is so apparent in living systems (which Denton recognized), perhaps scientific explanations for origins are not possible. Jon Covey"
5,"On the Establishment's ""Scientific"" Unthink","All my life, I had accepted Darwinian evolution as ""fact"" (assuming it was overseen by God). That is, until, about age 50, when I read Denton's calm, highly technical, superb review of the scientific evidence against Darwin's theory. (My master's degree in natural history helped in reviewing his material.) When I finished Denton's book, I was very, very angry because I had been duped by the ""establishment"" all those years. The ""establishment"" has promoted scientific fictions instead of scientific facts because it finds the REAL scientific facts about ""evolution"" to be ""philosophically"" unacceptable."
3,Arguments that remain relevant,"When published in 1985 this book was seminal in crystallizing the growing disillusionment with darwinism and was instrumental in encouraging the I.D movement. Many years later his arguments still hold water as serious blows to the evolutionist paradigm, such as typology, the sequences of homologous proteins; the reality of what is indicated by the fossil record, and so on.These facts do not go away just because the evolutionist cabal has chosen to continue to ignore, hide or cloud them with obscurantist bluster.Denton himself is an agnostic, reaffirming that not all criticism of evolution is necessarily inspired by religious belief."
3,Compression isn't what it says,"I have medical grade support hose that I bought from the doctor's office after I had a vein removed from my left leg. they're very firm and difficult to get on. I bought the futuro knee highs because it's only my calf that needs the compression now, but I'm afraid the compression on these just isn't what it says it is. I originally bought the large, which according to the chart is actually smaller than my calf size. I should be wearing an X-tra large. The large size was at best a mild compression. so I returned it and went down to a medium. The compression on the medium is better, much more supportive, but it's still not what I would call a firm. And firm is what I need for my left leg unfortunately. The product will work for a while but eventually I'm still going to need something else."
5,Gotta have it,If you play Everquest you need this expansion or life would not be complete. If you have never played Everquest you should not buy this expansion now. Buy the originl software for ($$$)and learn to play. As a beginnger you will not be able to use this expansion for a very long time...you would die in seconds and be very sad.
2,Might have been great.,"The graphics are out of whack and with this expansion. SOE decided to hose the monk class so if you plan on purchashingPOP and play a monk, your wasting your money. Otherwise, thisexpansion might be ok.Dkj"
1,Waste of Time and Money,Another Expansion? What the heck they just came out with one about what 5 months ago geez i think the word Greedy comes into play . Come on I mean 1st they bring out a Expansion that requires you to upgrade your computer in order for it to work.... then they jack up the subscription Fee and now this . Save your money Folks for Star Wars Galaxies or World of Warcraft
3,An exhaustive work drawn from slanted data and conclusions.,"I read this book in preparation for a term paper arguing against affirmative action. I must agree with your reviewer from Lansing, Michigan. The data collected appears to be skewed in the authors' favor and there is no comparitable data arguing that a similar number of minority students would have fared just as well with AA."
5,Rock'n'Roll Shangri-La,"These guys came out of nowhere with spine-tingling performances at rock festivals near and far, that featured mind-blowing harmonies, '70s-style post-hippy rock-solid cojones, and tunes that sounded oddly like undiscovered classics. They came outta nowhere -- and on to nowhere did they disappear.Though the lads are English, according to rumor, the sound is unapologetically Yank -- or maybe North American, as a live version of ""Ohio"" graces the Japanese pressing of this album.This is the classic '70s FM radio platter that didn't come into existence until the disk of the millenium."
3,It's about time,"It's about time we could get our hands on some George Perkins. To bad this sounds like it is taken off old 45's. I looked for years for more of his songs after hearing ""Crying in the Streets"" on a comp. of old soul stuff. Even with the skips and scratches on this cd it's worth the wait. Let's hope someone can get their hands on the master tapes and make a better sounding cd one day."
5,I loved it.,"I found this book in the book shelf, and I remembered having read it before. I started on the first page and could not put it down. I stil can't find two animals, but otherwise I have solved the rest. I think this book should belong in the age group 6-100 because it is fun for everyone. I love the ending and can't wait till I read the other two books by this author, ""Around the World With Phineas Frog"" and ""One Odd Old Owl""."
3,I like it but dont love it,"Its a good tea sampler set, but it wasnt great. Alot of the flavors taste the same as the others. I was expecting something a little better. I was hoping it would be a contender with teavana's teas, but it wasnt. Good nonetheless"
5,Review041404,"The book was very good. I thought the descriptions and details of each person and event were very concrete and visual. This was the first real ""war"" story that kept my interest the whole way through. Overall excellent, the ending was just a little loose for me. What ever happened with Ronnie continuing in Med School after he was done serving his time in the Navy and what happened with the other two roommates? With that be the next book?"
4,review,It was a pleasant surprise coming across this book as it emcompasses many of the important subject matters in marketing. The authors have managed to cover a lot of key concepts in this slim volume of work. I especially like the chapters on marketing research and branding which were very good with a sound framework. I would certanily recommend this book to a larger audience such as a MBA class in business or marketing.
1,Not too good,Purchased for my sister. She states that the product leaks. Not very good . Perhaps for a gallon sized bottle not a mouth wash bottle.
4,Take me to live in Tammyland for a while!,I get that good feeling of the wholesome life whenever I watch Tammy and how she gets through her problems! Totally relaxing and enjoyable for me!
5,Tammy DVD set,My sisters and I would watch these movies everytime we found them on tv. We would even call each other to say they were on. So nice to have them in a set so we can watch them when we want.
5,Tammy and the Doctor,I bought this movie for my daughter. When this movie first came out I was 15 years old. After seeing it I was going to name my daughter Tammy from then on. She grew up and married a Doctor!!
5,Tammy movies,"These movies were my favorite movies growing up. I was named after Sandra Dee and enjoy all of her movies. I especially love the song ""Tammy's in Love"". Very cute movies! Thanks for making these available!"
5,More Classics,"I always enjoyed these. Debbie Reymolds is an all time favorite of mine. I have enjoyed all of her movies and these were some of my favorite ""Tammy"" movies. She is fresh and funny and just adorable. The perfect girl next door tiype. If it is nostalgia you want you can't go wrong with these."
2,Book club book didn't enjoy,"i read this book because it was on our book club list. to be honest, I wouldn't have bought it if it hadn't been for the book club and thought about not finishing it, as did others in the book club. The author told a story, but felt that he was trying to convey a message about whether ""civilized nations"" are better than ""barbarions"" and didn't enjoy the way he did it. Sorry, not my kind of book."
5,One of Coetzee's Best Works,"Even though this takes place in South Africa at a very specific moment in its history, this allegorical read could apply almost anywhere at almost any time. It affects how one sees place and how one envisions the consequences of change."
4,"read this and know how not to act as a ""civilized"" society","I was totally appalled by ignorance and ideals that make up a so called ""civilized"" society. This book clearly illustrates the prejudices that white society has about ""barbarian"" and what makes them so barbarous. Read the book and one will find that civilized and uncivilized are very closely related."
2,"Sorry, I disagree.","Sorry---I disagree with the rave reviews for this book. The use of language was exquisite, but dazzling language does not excuse a really depressing book. Read it for my book group, and there, again, I was in the minority. Also, too many unexplained items, such as the author's obsession with the Magistrate's sexuality."
5,An important book,"This book's reputation preceded it; I was not disappointed. There are some who believe Coetzee is our finest living writer. I am among them. Waiting for the Barbarians is a rare book. Seldomly has so few words achieved such clarity. It is on level with the classics the ""Heart of Darkness"" and ""1984""."
2,"Important, but Way Too Long!","The essence of ""Iraq Confidential"" is that the CIA and NSC were unwilling to permit a U.N. arm led by an American to successfully investigate what weapons Saddam had. The problem was that U.N. policy was to lift sanctions once Saddam had shown disarmament, while U.S. policy was to retain sactions until regime change, regardless of Iraq's armament. In addition, there were also problems with poor coordination between the CIA and FBI.The key ""bottom line"" is that this Machiavellian U.S. strategy to defeat arms inspection probably led to the U.S. and G.B. being convinced in 2003 that Saddam had WMD when he actually had none, and thereby an unnecessary war.As for Scott Ritter, he ended up becoming controversial himself (to say the least); fortunately Seymour Hersch's vouching for Scott makes the book credible. Regardless, ""Iraq Confidential"" should have only been an article - not nearly 300 pages."
3,Preview to book.,"I heard Scott Ritter's interview on the Commonwealth Club. Is his information a revelation or is he just promoting his book. I would like to listen to some of his old interviews on PBS before the War. I suppose it all comes down to whether regime change was in the best interests of the country. If in fact this book is just a rant, then his credibility is in question. (Rants from the pro-war side are equally tiresome)."
2,A Book Hard To Finish,"It's an okay book. I had a hard time finishing it, but I did, eventually. I am certain that most of what the book talks about are based on facts, as Ritter was the Chief Inspector for UNSCOM for Iraqi disarmament. I also happen to think that his work is full of self-preservation."
2,Incomplete,"The book tells the history of how the two brothers have used high credit risk customers to their advantage. They tell how they have been successful at ensuring prompt payment from these customers. Only problem is they are incomplete on telling you HOW they ensure prompt payment. Example: They state you can ask five simple questions to determine the credit risk of an individual, but never tell you the five questions. The book is in dire need of a grammar checker. The book is defintely focused on collecting from individuals."
3,W-h-i-n-e......,"Fast, excellent text. But don't buy this printer unless you're deaf. For 10-11 minutes after each print job it emits a faint(but not faint enough)high-pitched whine. We couldn't believe this was a ""feature,"" so we got our first unit replaced. Same noise. Probably OK in a loud office, but if you need to write or think in the same room with it, you're going to have to turn it off repeatedly. Fortunately, unlike some other newer printers, it DOES have an on/off switch."
4,Your Body Belongs to You,"I was looking for a book to help me explain to my children ages 3 and 5 that their body is theirs and they are the only ones who can touch their private parts. Also, that they have the right to refuse any kind of touch that makes them uncomfortable and this book illustrated this concept very well."
1,"If you can set it up, it might be good","The setup of this game alone is too much to handle. A practice session of the game has a 26-page instruction booklet. This is not a game for those unfamiliar with the ""Catan"" series. Not recommended."
3,Fair,"was ok...the only problem was, after buying the whole Gillian Kemp series...i realised that...all her books are copies of one another...interesting as they are, i was somewhat disappointed when i started reading my newest possesion only to see that i had already read it somewhere...and...guess where??!! in her previous book!"
3,It's HUGE!,"I purchased this pillow prior to hip surgery with hopes it would help me sleep on my side. However the pillow was just too large to handle with my limited motion. When my hip is healed and I have more mobility, I will try using it again but I'm not hopeful. I can't imagine that my husband, the pillow and I would be able to fit comfortably in one queen sized bed!"
1,not great,My neck hurts more than it ever did before! I have to bunch it up or its too flat to just lay on after a while. Very disappointed.
5,Good pillow,"Its a nice pillow and is filled up well. Much better than the $10 pillows you get at walmart of target. It would say it has medium body. It does have that gel feeling and is 'mushy' instead of the more flat feeling with the other pillows. Lets say this, if you pick it up, it will fall immediately after where your hand is. It won't stand on its own. But its filled well and I would say is heavier when compared to a normal polyester filled pillow."
3,Pregnant? Too Hot!,"I bought this pillow to help support my pregnant belly when I was 5 months pregnant. I used it twice. It is too hot! If you are pregnant and you are warm most of the time, I don't recommend this pillow. Also, it is very bulky and hard to manage in a queen size bed with another person in there too. I could just be wierd but I thought I would share that it really seems to keep the heat and was just too hot for me."
3,Not as firm as I would have liked,"I am a body pillow addict, cannot sleep without one! In the past I have purchased body pillows from BBB which were fiberfill and fell flat in no time. I have been using two body pillows in the same cover for extra support and that works relatively well. Saw this Beyond Down Gel Fiber Body Pillow and thought it sounded like a perfect fit. Feels like a feather pillow, it's fluffy and substantial BUT using it for support didn't go so well. The pillow ""smooshes"" down too much lacking the support I desire."
1,not what i expeceted,this pillow goes flat as soon as you lay on it no support at all.not worth the money was very disapointted in product.Beyond Down Gel Fiber Body Pillow
2,Bollywood stereo type!,"this book is a typical bollywood stereo type... Boy from rich family with dark secrets... meets girl, falls in love and his past comes to light through the girls best friend!Its a bollywood movie in book form! I imagined Shahrukh Khan enacting the role of Rattan and Kareena Kapoor that of Nalini! All that was missing were the trees, the dancing and the music!!!!"
4,A decent Probability textbook,"I brought the textbook for my prob class, and so far the content has been straightforward and understandable. It would have been better to have the hw problems immediately after each section and the answers to the problems at the back. But overall, the book is pretty extensive and covers a good area of probability (i'm only on the 2nd chapter so far though)."
4,"extra storage, yea!","Can't take too much weight, but is serving the purpose as additional storage which was much needed."
2,Too fragile,Purchased for underbed college storage but the baskets are very lightweight. Only very light garments or school supplies can be placed in them. They appeared more sturdy in the photo.
3,What a difference!,"I read the comic, and boy was I surprised! I saw the movie first, and I loved it! But the comic is different entirly! In the movie, the mask is a cartoony, wacky nice guy. But in the comic, he is a wacky, cartoony homicidal and violent guy! I liked the movie better."
4,"Nice, but never would pay the full price","Amazon had this for regular price of 50.00, definalty not worth that. GOt it for a great deal during the lightening pricing at the holidays. Really like it, its a very nice net, not heavy duty, but thats not what we wanted. we needed something that was light and easy to travel so we could take it to the park or drag it into the street, its the perfect weight and size for that."
4,Nice starter kit,"We got this kit for our 3 boys (7,4, and 2). The two year old wasn't into it but the others like it. The tubes of the net do come apart if you don't press the together tightly. The sticks have a flat blade so they aren't handed. Perfect for beginners. Overall it's a good starter kit.UPDATE: After a year, this is holding up nice. The only issue we have is that the tubes come apart fairly easy so we are popping them back together occasionally. I could glue them, but I like the option to take it apart for winter storage. The kids still love it."
3,Super tiny,Super tiny & really expensive 40.00 & no pillow case... Great if you travel on plains or trains. I don't regret this purchase it's just not worth 40.00 Plus more money for the pillow case
3,Not Standard Size,"Perhaps, I should own the blame for my low rating but here goes. I assumed I was getting a standard bed pillow but instead I recieved a very nice fluffy expensive travel sized pillow which I still have stowed in the closet because I can't think of what else to do with it. I can't hardly present it as a gift to my husband for which it was meant by putting a colossal sized pillow slip on it and placing it on our King Size bed and saying, ""Here Dear, I got you a brand new down pillow just like you've always wanted"". Again, maybe it was my bad because I didn't pay close enough attention to deminsions or something. If you verify this, you should be good to go."
2,Unacceptable errors,"I recently obtained the second edition of this text, since it seemed like it gave a fresh approach to the topic. I happen to be teaching this topic this semester, and so I went to the chapters dealing with computability and complexity theory. I found several glaring errors in terminology there, and this is simply unacceptable in a text. Apparently, the reviewers didn't do their job here. For example, in chapter 10, the author attempts to treat the classes P, NP, and NP-complete. Unfortunately, the term NP is used in many cases where NP-complete should be used. This leads to several areas of confusion. (Just because a problem is in the class NP, doesn't mean it is intractable -- it could be trivial, since P is a subset of NP.)In summary, there are several other texts out there that are relatively readable and accurate. Among them are Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et al, and Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms by Levitin."
5,WARNING,"Beowulf is an amazing story, and Donaldson's translation is suberb. HOWEVER, the black cover that just says beowulf in script is NOT a norton critical edition, it is just the Beowulf text with an introduction, and none of the essays that go with the actual Norton Critical Edition, which actually costs less. The Real Norton Critical Edition based on Donaldson's text has a blue cover, and says it is the ""prose edition."" I made the mistake, so don't make it yourself. The Black covered version is only 55 pages long, so the Beowulf text is all there, but nothing else."
4,Traditional Gaelic sounds from an English band,"Although the band is not from Ireland, you'd never know it. Of course, there are musicians from many places such as Canada, Australia, USA,Scotland and Galicia in Spain that effectively play Celtic music and add this band to the ever growing list. This is an all instrumental CD with a fairly brief running time of 42 minutes but what's here is good music played well."
5,Can't get enough of SheDaisy!,This cd is no different than any of their others....all sorts of great songs on it! My favorite and the main reason I had to have this one is Come Home Soon...very touching song - I can listen to it over and over!! If you've never heard anything by SheDaisy I recommend this one and The Whole Shebang!
2,It is Readable,"I do like that I can read this on the Kindle. That gets a 2. The formatting and navigation is poor. I blame the Kindle as much as IBD. I am not worried about the charts. I do like the ability to make clippings so I can come back to it later.The big difficulty I have is knowing if I ever read all of the segments I want or what the topics of the segements are.Poor navigation, and it being readable gets two stars."
1,Disappointing,"I was hopeing it would be more informative, like the Wall Street. The newspaper was very disappointing. The only good thing is it was ready to download when I turned the wireless on."
2,Army Men 2 for Gameboy color,"First of all, if you buy this game, be sure you have specifically Gameboy color. You can sort of use it on Gameboy Advance, but not the same. Also, apparently you should have a second part to it and play with another person.My son played it for a day or two, and then hasn't touched it, so I guess it is not as much fun as some others."
4,An excellent debut novel: crime with passion,"Well written and generally tightly plotted: this book had me enthralled from page 1. The science is used to inform and guide rather than to overwhelm, and analytical thinking features ahead of high tech gadgetry. There are some satisfying twists in the tale, and the use of language is wonderful. The characters have promise and I look forward to reading more by this author. If you like Tess Gerritsen's novels, add Elizabeth Becka to your list!Highly recommended."
2,Copper Bottom,"What ever happened to good old-fashioned mercury batteries? They had the highest capacity per size back in the day, and the output voltage was always stable. Not many so-called ""Alkaline"" batteries can say that today. If a copper-top could give you a steady 1.35V, maybe it'd get more than 2 stars."
2,Med Tech CLS Review,"This book shows the basics of the subjects involved. However, it receives 2 stars because of so many mis-spelled words, blocks of text inserted into the wrong places, and simply wrong answers in numerous places."
5,Great Stuff,"I'm a hot sauce fanatic, and have to say this is a pretty solid staple in the kitchen. It's nothing spectacular, but it beats Tabasco and Cholua everytime. If you want something with a lot of kick, then look elsewhere. If you're looking for some controlled heat, then this is the sauce for you!"
5,did ok.,"I did a full review and said this product was sent correctly and it looked like what the ad said.I am sick of doing these things for Amazon. Look, my opinion does not matter until I am unsatisfied. So If I do not say anything negative, then it was a good sale and is a good product. Amazon, quite pestering me with these damb stupid review requests. Leave me alone. I do not want to be bothered any more about why I buy something or why I like something. It makes for a hostel feeling that you want a pat on the back all the time. Be happy I bought something from you and if the is an issue, I will let you know."
5,Classic G-movie!,"I had read nothing but bad reviews of this movie over the years, and when I finally saw it, I thought it was one of the most entertaining of the series! Cheesy, but not as boring as the 90's Zilla movies, and not as awful as GODZILLA VS MEGALON. The first really menacing monster since Godzilla himself, and one of the only G films to reflect the time in which it was made, with acid rock, and long hair everywhere! Very enjoyable, but also very rare, I recommend picking it up soon before its gone for good!"
5,THIS CD IS AWESOME!!!!!!,"This is one of the greatest albums i have ever heard, right behind ""Pigwalk"" of course, but this Albm easily rises above ""rising, and ""snapping necks"" if you are looking for your first Stuck Mojo CD this is the one to get."
2,Disappointed,"What the heck were they thinking? Mojo ruled until now. Are they trying to go mainstream like Metallica? They had a recipe that worked, and this is not even from the same cookbook! The only good thing is they still bash liberals like Jesse Jackson, bums, etc... Not enough Bonz here to satisfy. I'm very disappointed with this album. I let someone borrow it and I don't even care if I get it back!"
5,A Must For All Keith Moon Fanatic's!,"Let me start out by saying;Moonie is no Roger Daltrey in the vocal department,but true fans Won't mind. The photo's alone are worth the price. There are some funny moments(Keith and Ringo are hilarious on Harry Nilson's Together), as well as some tears(I dare you to listen to Keith warble In My Life and not get choked up).The best songs vocally, by far, are: Do Me Good, Real Emotion, And Randy Newman's Naked Man(how fitting!), which are from a 1975 session and added here as bonus tracks. Although uncredited, these 3 feature David Bowie on back-ups and Ron Wood on guitar.And inside the C.D. tray, Keith..well..moons us! If you love Moonie-You don't want to miss this true collecter's item."
1,Keith Moon - 'Two Sides Of The Moon' (Pet Rock),"Unless you're an absolute Who / Keith Moon (R.I.P.) completist,you just might want to avoid this CD altogether. A total of eighteen tracks that was apparently Moon's only solo effort. Thank goodness for that! Was first released in 1975. Take it from me, every Townsend, Daltrey & Entwistle (R.I.P.) solo album are WAY better than this disc. I've seen used copies of this CD in several music stores that have been collecting dust for years. A true lemon."
5,Works Great! Once I figure out how to use it.,"Works Great!Didn't read the instruction at first, didn't realize that it must click twice first. So the first bottle of wine tested didn't do so well. But after I read the box again, I realized my mistake and now it works Great!"
5,Works beautifully,"After having gone through a few brands of these, it was really nice to find one that worked really well. I had other brands that were barely able to create any vacuum at all before they would fail and let air back in. This one works very well."
5,I WANNA BE LIKE JERRY!!!,"Jerry Colangelo delivers absolutely the most powerful message in his new book, ""How You Play The Game,"" which is, you can't have success without giving. Colangelo discusses a wide range of topics that helped him get to where he is today. He discusses forming partnerships, being a good person before becoming a role model, and staying focused. Jerry Colangelo is definitely an inspiration to me, and I believe all that he says is true!"
4,cool book,"this book was pretty cool. Unlike the previous book I read on sports marketing, this book wasn't boring. This book was a pretty quick read. This book can be helpful to people who are looking to own a team or anyone who just wants to start their own business."
3,Frauliens in Uniform a review,"70s film with allot of nudity. Thats about it. Nothing more nothing less. This is probably a hard to find DVD. I would say most people would probably pass on this movie but what the heck for guys who like nudes from the 70s, here you go."
1,no wonder the krauts lost,this movie made no sense. I could not figure it out. lucky for me there were lots of nice girls to look at. otherwise I would have snoozed off..on second thought maybe I should have taken a nap..save your money for something like hard bodies. or the Andy sidaris box set of girls guns and g strings
4,From the cover,"From the book:In this comprehensive study, the author argues that the Old Testament tabernacle and temples were symbolically designed to point to the end-time reality that God's presence, formerly limited to the holy of holies, was to be extended throughout the whole cosmos. Hence, John's vision in Revelation 21 is best understood as picturing the new heavens and earth as the eschatological temple. This stimulating exposition traces the theme of the tabernacle and temple along the Bible's story-line, also illuminating many texts and closely related themes. It shows how the significance and symbolism of the temple can be better understood in the light of contrasts to and similarities with the Ancient Near Eastern assumptions, and offers new insights into the meaning of the temple in both Old and New Testaments."
3,"A fun, light read","While not among the best Regency Romances that I've read, this book is a fun, light read. I enjoyed the heroine. She was just as spoiled as I imagine some of these women really were. She is captivated by her own charm and beauty. Jasper sees the sweetness beneath this conceit and the pursuit is on. I enjoyed seeing the two of them interacting. The kissing scenes were over the top and got to be ridiculous after a while. However, I enjoyed the book and recommend it to those who like a quick, light read in the tradition of Marion Chesney."
2,disappointed,"This book was a big disappointment. I thought it would be bigger. It was impossible to find Waldo, even with the magnifying glass. I went out and bought the larger version at Barns & Noble."
1,It's my fault for not reading the entire description,"I'd like to say that I've learned my lesson.From now on, I will read every word of the product information and description.This book is so small..Even my 4 year old doesn't use this book.I never take it anywhere with me. It doesn't even occur to me to pop it in my purse.Honestly, this was a waste of money for me. I kept it to remind me of my mistakes.The free magnifying lens doesn't help the fact that this book is so puny.If I could do it all over again, no, I would not buy this book, or the two other little ones I bought along with this one."
2,Good playing but the singing is brutal,"The guys can play that's for sure and tho Tommy Bolin isn't Ritchie Blackmore he makes some nice contributions to this album. Ian Paice and Jon Lord do what they do very well. However the singing is atrocious and detracts from whatever interest the instrumentation might engender. Dave Coverdale is out of tune and straining exactly as many times as he is singing well. A 50% rating of ""good"" is not. But the worst is Glenn Hughes whose R&B cliches and screachingly high pitched vocals get on my last nerve. That pseudo funk/r&b direction Hughes favors did not work in my opinion for the band. For example Hughes for reasons known only to himself inserts a cover of Georgia in the middle of Smoke On The Water and then proceeds to oversing it as only he (and Michael Bolton) can. That alone my friends was enough of a WTF?!? moment for me to pitch this cd in the resell pile. What a tasteless bozo, no wonder Ritchie Blackmore left after the lackluster Stormbringer album."
4,Years of pure class,"For those who liked King Crimson ( original) were excited by ELP forming, and like rock music ( and gary Moore )this is very good. Good covers of classics, tremendous guitar from Gary Moore and a couple of tunes I didn't know, put together with good quality sound.Had I been there I am sure this gig would have been way up there, as a live CD the quality is excellent.A seriously good value purchase."
3,still not what I was looking for...,"I thought that most of the book had a good overtone, but there were still a sort of warning in the book about the breed. I have never had my pits act in a ""pit"" manner, just a dog manner... they are always kenneled together, and have never been separated more than a couple days in their entire lives. I just think that this book, while trying to be good, has too much cautionary advice in it. They are dogs first, pits second... which means they have skin problems, are adorable, goofy, crazy tolerant, and can clear coffee tables with a single swipe of a tail... not some deranged neighbor-killing machine or a must be under constant supervision at all times to not attack another dog/family member, at least no more than any other dog... if any pit owners are looking for a book for some limelight on their dogs, I'm not sure this is it, although it's much better than some other books I've found..."
4,99 GRAND CARAVAN HITCH,"Instruction says 20 mins to install. It took me almost a full day. Some of the problems were not attributed to the hitch though. The existing bolts on the van were seized and my impact socket would not budge it, so I had to use a 1/2 inch breaker bar. The other major problem was drilling the third hole on each side of the van. A half inch hole would not work. I found that out the hard way. I could not pull the bolt though the hole and had to finally break off the fishing wire and abandon the bolt in the steel channel. I finally went to the hardware store to buy smaller bolts so that I would not need to remove the already installed hitch to drill a larger hole. What a mess."
4,Sin and redemption,"who is the real sinner and who should be redeemed? Socially acceptable sin without redemption...antisocial behavior and forgiveness.I loved being pulled into the cold world of the mirror (you might need to be under the covers for this book)and taking a look at human nature.There were a few things I wish were explored more, but overall it was a great story and once you got into it you had no choice but to follow the path laid out.I cant wait to read A Man of Two Worlds"
4,"EVIL, TIMES TWO","EVIL, TIMES TWOPressley Barclay was a well-known horror author looking for some inspiration. When he bought a foreboding gothic, country estate with a checkered past, he thought he found exactly what he needed.But, when he finds the mirror that was meant to be kept hidden, he is transported to another world. This world is dark and mysterious and inhabited by the two. Can Pressley solve the centuries-old mystery and free the two from their purgatory?Award-winning writer Andrea Dean Van Scoyoc creates a dark and sinister tale that strikes fear into even the most seasoned horror reader. Her attention to detail is unparalleled and paints a world of despair.Van Scoyoc does a masterful job in shocking the reader. Her in-depth narration of the murderous deeds of the two will astonish the reader to his or her core. ""The Two"" is truly evil and will be a favorite in any horror connoisseur's library. - Leigh O'Donovan - Authors on the Rise Book Reviews"
4,The Two is chilling,"Absolutely disturbing...just the way I like it. It's not the same old crap. The ending will leave you in shock. I recommend this book to anyone who likes stories told without all the sugar coating of the world.This book lets you feel the emotions of the main character, Pressley Barclay, and draws you in to the plot. You can feel a connection to all of the characters somehow.Andrea did a great job on this book and I look forward to reading her other works."
3,Giants,"Giants Is an awesome game, when I started out I thought it as designed to be a kids game. Well its not, the story line is slightly vulgar. Only an adult would truly get entertainment from this game. Graphics are excellent, scenes are wonderful and it's down right fun. Problems: You think Kabuto would be the fun one. Well let's just say that I just ran to the objectives from the boredom. Fortunately Kabuto is the last creature you play, the reaver was the most fun for me as she moves very fast. I suggest this game its load of fun for everyone. Good mission play and lots of laughs. Suggest this game for the true gamer as it will provide a new style of play. Not s must have but I you have a few bucks go ahead and get it you will have fun."
1,It crashed during the install!,"The game crashed once during the install and again during the opening movie. Once I got the game actually working I found sub-standard graphics, fuzzy inaudible sound, and gameplay that resembled the earliest attempts at doom (if those attempts were programmed by a four-year-old). Not only did this game waste my money, but it took 2 hours of my life I will never get back."
1,Salsa Boot Camp,"This was one of the worst videos I have ever bought. Most of the video expressed their thoughts on dance etiquette and misc information. i.e. they advised you to take a shower before one dances with their partner. If you want someone to teach you dance steps, this is not the video for you."
5,These are the songs you remember from when you were young!,Most of the songs on this video are also on the Sesame Street Platinum All-Time Favorites CD.
1,Disappointment,"I bought this for my 13 month old daughter. I was excited to add a new Sesame Street video to her collection because she absolutely loves watching them. This dvd, however, does not keep her attention at all. She gets bored watching it. What a waste of money. The other Sesame Street dvds we own hold her attention for the duration of the video. She loves to watch them. Unfortunately, this one doesn't do the same. I don't recommend it."
1,We own it for over 6 months,"and still haven't played the full DVD once. That's how bad this one is for my 15 month old son. Maybe, he will like it when he grows, until then it can't get his attention nor mine. It doesn't have the basics all DVDs have like menus, song selections, and etc. Picture quality is OK. I regret for buying it based on some of the reviews here."
4,Format doesn't serve the content,"I love Sesame Street. I love the music especially. I love every single song included in this collection. Unfortunately, the bare-bones production of this DVD makes watching these classic segments a mediocre experience for an adult.This DVD doesn't have a menu, has awkward chapter markers, and has fuzzy video quality. Most disappointing, many of the included songs have been edited down to being merely clips rather than full songs (""Do the Rubber Duck,"" for example).I hope that the Sesame Street: Old SchoolSesame Street - Old School, Vol. 1 (1969-1974)series of releases continues, so that I can see and share my favorite Sesame Street memories. The 25th Birthday DVD is an okay stopgap in the short term, but will not satisfy older and more fervent Sesame Street fans."
5,Sesame DVD,This DVD is great! My daughter watches it almost every day. She loves it! Me and my husband love it too since we were brought up on Sesame Street and like to see the old stuff from when we were kids.
3,25th Birthday Musical Celebration,"It was cute, touching and entertaining. But I was expecting more of showcasing special extra special highlights from earlier shows back in the day. Fortunately, the purchase wasn't that expensive.I do however, enjoy the cultural melting pot that Sesame Street has always strived for with diversity in people, culture and basically everything."
3,OK but much prefer the Mexican Harvest variety,"First sampling yielded a ""not-quite yuck"" factor but definitely not a ""hooray"" either. I've gotten used to them and will finish the order, but future orders will be Mexican Harvest. In general, I love the crunch and healthy ingredient list as I avoid traditional crackers."
3,JOE SATRIANI PLAYS ON THIS ONE,"Alot of Satch fans don't know this, but he played on the Greg Kihn 1986 tour and King Biscuit recorded a Greg Kihn show that features Satch on lead guitar. Virtually unknown back then, Satch plays with Kihn, whose popularity started to diwindle in the mid-80's. Greg and Co. are in fine rockin' form and as expected all his hits are here. It's fun to listen to Satch play songs like Lucky, Jeopardy, and the Breakup Song. Satch does catch some fire towards the end of the show, and roughs up the song solos to his likeing, but he is restrained to only being a sideman and not the lead dog head honcho of the show. But still it is worth buying if you're a Kihn or a Satch fan."
4,An interesting autobiography,"I thought that ENDLESS HIGHWAY was an interesting book. It showed a lot of what Carradine went through, and his triumphs. It has amusing moments and memories in it, along with powerful ones. It gives you a new dimension to add to that of which you see on television."
1,Not Happening!,Loved the Caldwell era of Tucker. Great live band.Bought this........wow..bad. Hate to say it. Toys singing is terrible. He never was a singer except for occasionally. A little went a long way. Great pickin though. I give it one star because of my dissapointment. Isn't their enough material for a 'live' Tucker album from the Caldwell era? Gotta be. This album doesn't suffice.
3,Southern Man,"This is a very enjoyable album.Sure it's not perfect,but as Toy said ,""I wrote the songs, I can play them any way I please.''This whole album is a very moving experience considering the standing of the man.Crossy"
5,This Common Ground,Great book to put you in the mood for a simpler more wholesome life where you don't get caught up in the hype of our 21st century society.I really enjoyed it.
5,Great for 7 string guitars,"I love Dean Markley Blue Steels. Tried a few other brands for seven string guitars and found that these are far superior. They ""break in"" very quickly and stay in tune. Even after being in a hot car for 8 hours."
1,Not worth it...,"They sent me a black Treo 750 case, which does not fit a Treo 650 or 700. The clear case that I recieved is ripped and too big for a 700p."
4,Very informative book.,"I'm actually just finishing up the book now. I'm really enjoying it.The author did some excellent research and provided a lot of descriptive information on the subject. I had never heard many of these facts before.Some of the standouts in this book include the author's ability to help us get to know the victims of the Antrhrax attacks. He humanizes them well.I have to admit that some of the early medical jargin in the first chapter was a little over my head. The average person, with no medical background, may find it a little overwhelming.However, I understand that this information was important and needed to be described.The rest of the book concentrates on the victims and the investigation.A very fascinating and enlightening book. At the time of these attacks, I never felt as though the public was getting the entire story, as far as detail. This book answers a lot of questions."
2,Disappointing text with incredible illustrations,"Despite the ambitious title of this book, the projects found inside, ranging from planting a terrarium to creating a Japanese rock garden, are a bit lacking. The reader is given only the most vague growing information without any scientific background or general gardening knowledge. The author, in fact, recommends that the reader seek out books on roses for her Rose Garden project! While flowers and herbs are included in the book's projects, vegetables are completely overlooked. However, the illustrations are absolutely beautiful, very Victorian in nature, and are inspirational in their sheer floriferous-ness. Although this is not a ""one stop shop"" book, the basic project ideas combined with the illustrations, may provide a very beginning young gardener with some incentives to get growing!"
2,Pleased at first,"I ordered this watch for my boyfriend for Christmas. It came packaged perfectly and he absolutely loved it. However, in March it stopped running true to time. He keeps trying to reset it with the current time, and 12 hours later, for example, only 2 hours on the watch will have passed by! I took it to a local jewelry store which sells Tag, Rolex, etc., and they checked the battery and said it was fine, so there is something wrong with the watch. Even though it was a greatly discounted price, it was still an expensive watch that I expected to last for a long time. Hopefully I can send it in to Movado and get it repaired, but even that costs at least $75."
5,Very Sleek,"I'm 22 and was looking for a fair priced watch to wear to work and home. This is it. I paid only $279.00 from chronoshark.com the other day. I was immediately attracted by its simplicity yet elegant look. Before purchasing it, I was a bit skeptical and asked my family and gf to see if they liked how it looked in pictures. They thought it was nice and when I told them the price they insisted on me getting it. I was still worried, but after opening up the box today, I am 100% satisfied. This watch will get heads turning. People will think your a classy high roller. You could pass this off as a $1000 watch if you felt so conceded. I cannot stress enough the beauty of this watch. Just don't buy from amazon.com as there are plenty of other sites that sell this for hundreds of dollars cheaper. Just take the time and search for them."
4,I Was At This Show...And It Was Great!,"Strangely, this CD only has songs from the first two 10cc albums, ignoring the more-popular-but-uneven The Original Soundtrack. Nevertheless the songs on here are played with amazing dexterity and authority, especially for a band that most people see as a twee studio group. Like the review title says, I was at this show and it totally rocked. There's no way a ""real"" 10cc fan (e.g. someone into them before ""I'm Not In Love"") is going to be disappointed by this record."
3,Acceptable release for phenomenal movie.,"Just got my copy of MSPS16 (along with the sequels!) on DVD. This review is for the DVD, not the movie (which is great). I was a bit worried that because of the format, this movie would lack in quality. I was surprised to find that the quality is just as good as it was back on October 23rd, 2009 when I caught the flick on TV, but it's nothing worth raving about. Another good bonus was that it's the uncut version, though I was disapointed to find that this version has the commercial cues unlike the iTunes version. It is what it is. If you can afford it, then I reccomend getting the DVD, especially because the movie itself is great."
3,subtitles?,this movie doesnt mention it has subtitles so thats disappointing... It had subtitles on t.v. earlier and it was good but for dvd... its sad.
5,Can't wait for the second book,I found it intreging and captivating. Couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the second book to come out next summer!! I would recommend it to all avid book readers!
1,Terrible,This dvd is terrible. It's like someone with a home movie camera who didn't know how to use it made this dvd. The video and sound are awful. I can't believe someone would put out such shotty work especially for the price they are charging for it. I felt like I have been taken. Please! Please! Please! do not spend your good money on this piece of trash. Will Henry should be ashamed of himself for putting out a product like this.
3,The electro-aversion therapy scene wins it for me,"I'd be loathe to call either of these classics, but I would buy this tape all the same, especially for the one scene where the family are wired in with the ability to shock each other. The way even Maggie jubilantly plays with the buttons is ingenious. Overall this episode has some other good moments but is no classic. I believe it was originally intended as the first ever episode, but the Christmas one got shown first. As for Life On the Fast Line, we see the first time the Simpsons family unit gets threatened, as a tenpin bowler called Jacques has nine fo the pins of his heart knocked over by Marge. In the end she decides not to go for the spare, but not before some tantilising moments. This one is amusing but doesn't have the spark and invention of the later episodes. More of a D'Oh than a Woo-Hoo. A good video to get but it shouldn't be top of your list."
5,This book is by far my favorite!,"I loved this book! It showcased the friendship between James and Sir Brian, a big reason to read the books. The trials Jim has to overcome and the way he triumphs over them using his intelligence and 20th century ideas is fascinating and original. The many plot twists make the book a can't put down-er, and it is full of a wonderful medeival atmosphere. A fabulous book!"
2,Soft gay porn,I only got this because I know Lorielle New and visit her live chat at times but had to fast forward thru the gay soft porn which I did not like
3,Great while it lasted.,"I bought two of these last winter to help with the heating bill. They worked great until they burnt out. The first one made it about six months then we noticed the thermostat became very incosistent. Shortly after that it turned off and would not turn back on. The second one made it almost to the end of its second winter, but bit it just like the first one. I wish they would have lasted longer than they did."
4,Classic Metal!,Ann's vocals are fantastic and classic metal!Chet Thompson's guitar work is show stopping as usual. One of the most under rated guitar players of his time.This album as a package will blow any metal heads socks off. Incredible stuff!
2,Very thin material,I was disappointed. The material reminds me of a very thin t-shirt. It doesn't look like the same item in the picture.
3,Not much support,"I was having some knee pain due to ligament injury. I found the Futuro knee support somewhat soft, and not really supportive. It provided a degree of compression, but not much. It also didn't breath much better than other products I have tried. If you're looking for much support you should probably look elsewhere."
1,Hate it,"Encouraged by all the reviews about this product, I bought it from Amazon. The smell was horrible. My Axe is better and cheaper than this"
4,Nice cologne for the price,"To be frank I am a value shopper, I try to find stuff worth the buck and let me assure you that this is surely a value deal. This cologne has a unique long lasting odour and is very good for daily use. I like the packaging, the bottle's cap is unique and feels very nice."
3,A lovely Voyage...,"Superb Fragrance.... At first not too sure... but then it grows on you... Most everyone likes that it has a crisp, clean scent.. ME TOO!"
4,Very nice!,This is one of the few colognes that I use in the summer time. It is a lot lighter than the other colognes I wear so it does not feel too heavy in the heat. I am getting married at the beach next month and this is the scent that I will wear. Recommended!
3,Nice...but very strong,"This cologne is a very unique ocean-scented cologne, but be warned- it's VERY strong. You don't need much to last you the day. I wear it for good luck, and it always works in my favor."
5,Great,I brought this for my husband after reading the reviews. I must say that we are very pleased with this. It is wonderful. It is a cross between curve soul and black by Kenneth Cole.
4,HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG WITH IT !!!,"NAUTICA VOYAGE... THIS PARTICULAR PERFUME IS JUST GREAT... NOT TOO STRONG AND NOT TOO LIGHT EITHER... CAN BE EASILY COMPARED TO ITS TOP KNOTS COMPETITIONS LIKE GUESS, CK, ETERNITY, AND SOME OTHER BRANDED PERFUMES LIKE DAVIDOFF COOLWATER ! WHICH IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE... IM JUST PLEASED AND HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASED... BUY IT YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH IT... 4 STARS BECAUSE ITS NOT THE BEST PERFUME OUT THERE... BUT 5 STARS ON PRICE WISE SMELLS WISE AND IN GENERAL..."
5,Good Stuff!,"This is really surprising, I am impressed by the performance of the fragrance, it does last a very long time.mild and pleasing... A++++"
1,The real one is good,"The real cologne is very good - this stuff they sell on Amazon is fake. At least, the bottle I received was fake.Five stars for the real cologne, zero stars for this fake stuff."
3,"worth the money, until you put it on","i was in macy's shopping for cologne and the lady recommended this to me, and i almost died cause i loved it so much. it smells kinda sweet at first, but it grew on me. i put it on EVERY single morning, like 4 squirts of it, and somehow, it wears off on the car ride to school, so it's like i never put it on. it might just be me, but i wouldn't take the risk. unless you're just going to spray it around your room to make it smell good, go with some armani or something."
1,Don't buy this one!,"Pros: Nice smell, stay fair enoughCons: No matter how you hold the bottle, it will LEAK while you spray!!"
3,Not bad,"Purchased this cologne based on the review, i guess it comes down to taste it's not bad but not great either. Kinda smells like a really light Polo Sport. Product was sealed in plastic so the it looks legit."
5,Brilliant Cockburn,"It goes without saying that this album is incredible (I have at least 6 or 7 BC albums, and as long as they don't drift too far into the folk music spectrum, I have nothing but praise for them) but it is in my view one of the most 'consistent' BC albums in my collection.There are no weak songs and everything, from The Trouble With Normal to Planet Of The Clowns, is incredible. From the trance-like rhythms of Hoop Dancer to the remarkable Going Up Against Chaos, this is an unforgettable album that for me is the most memorable album that I have yet heard from Bruce Cockburn."
5,great find,"I purchased this book to replace my old college textbook that I lent out to someone who I forgot, and I never got it back. This replacement was identical but like new and a lot cheaper than what I paid when I was in college 40 years ago. Excellent book!"
4,None,GREAT book....loved it!!!!!!!!I can not wait for another similar bookThank you Mr.StineKeep on giving us the goosebumbs!!!
4,Good but USB is sketchy,Not sure what the issue is but the USB does not work that well with my MacBook Pro- Great sound quality but not so happy with the USB being not so consistent.
5,Just Incredible,"If I had to summarize the review of these speakers into one word, it would be ""incredible"". This system delivers sound that you would expect from a much higher priced system. Sure, they are expensive already and are not for everybody because of that. But if you can afford these and are conflicted over which computer speakers to buy, these should be your choice every time. Well done, Bose."
5,Great product,"incredibly easy to set up wonderful sound, and very compact, I would highly reccomend these for a computer set up or even for your small home theater"
2,Poor midrange; Sound delay.,"I have a Klipsch Promedia GMX 2.1 setup that puts these to shame.Tested with AudioTest and I can hear the Klipsch up to 17K and down to 40.The Bose is from 40-15K.The Klipsch are two way satellites with a sub-woofer.Great sound all around from the Klipsch while the Bose is weak in the mid-range.They sound ""tinny.""Also the Bose has a noticeable delay.I have a Mac Pro and use Sounds4Fun which plays sounds for various actions.I also have many macros that play a sound upon completion.Add clicks for every key press.The Bose misses a lot of sounds and there is a perceptible delay.The Bose is connected via USB and the Klipsch via line out.Another big minus for me are the proprietary connectors Bose uses.ALL the Bose connectors are proprietary except the AC (which is odd but available).The Klipsch has a DIN connector but they are at least available."
2,Bose Companion 5,"Great speakers. I have had them for over 3/4 years now. But, when you play music at high volume the tend to muffle (might be a wrong word) the sound. The music will go up and down and I don't know why!!!?? I went to the Bose Authorised Dealer in Rosebank Mall (South Africa) and told them and they were puzzled as to why such an issue. I never returned them because I know of no other computer speaker that can match them. I normally have to remove the USB connection or lower the volume for about 5 minutes and the sound would be ok.Awesome speakers for Movies! I paid ZAR 6000!"
4,It works,"Product works as intended. Came with all attachments and manual so I can use it in the states or overseas. I purchased item used in ""like new"" condition, but it came with some dents in the outer case. The thing is built like a tank, so performance was not affected."
5,A great product ... exactly what I was looking for.,"I love this product. It's easy to use (both putting it on and taking it off). It completely covers all areas of the shopping cart surrounding the baby's seating area, keeping my 9-month old daughter's mouth off of the cart (yuck!). It's very cushy and she seems very comfortable in it. I also like that it has loops to hook toys onto and a little pocket to store a bottle or whatever. I would definitely recommend it over some of the other types of this product."
1,Is it possible to give less than 1 star?,"What a waste of a book deal! And to think that they let garbage like this get published when there are so many worthier writers out there. The worst part is, however, that there are people who actually are willing to buy this crap."
3,What happens when two of the best prog guitarists unite?,"They get in each other's way, that's what. Even when each tries to stay out of the way when the other guy wrote the song. Even though they both have synthesizer-interfaced guitars so that one of them can pretend to be a ""keyboardist"". The only point of interest, really, is singer Max Bacon, whose vocal resemblance to Styx's Dennis DeYoung is uncanny. Even though I was never a big Styx fan. Unfortunately, the only other place I heard Bacon was on one song from Mike Oldfield's ""Islands"" album. Where's he been at since, huh?"
4,Quite Good,"It is true there are some lose threads in this novel, however it does not mean that Kafka on the Shore wont lift you up from where you are sitting and bring you into a world where mystery, philosophy and mystic reign free. Overall, I found this novel invigorating and look forward to reading other stuff by Haruki Murakami, definitely quite an experience."
1,Trite and Underwhelming,"Extremely trite, sophomoric, flat, and boring. The connection between story lines is weak and anticlimatic. There are so many promising elements of foreshadowing that went nowhere, leaving me feeling cheated. The charcters are one-dimensional and unengaging. Very disappointed. Read Night Circus instead, if you like Magical Realism."
1,don't waste your time,"Pretentious clap-trap of little significant value. It asks much of the reader, giving nothing in return. Don't bother."
3,I'm on the fence,"I like magical realism as much as the next person, but I'm not entirely satisfied with what Murakami has in this novel. Although there is a germ for several fascinating stories, none of them play out to a satisfying conclusion. There is an Oedipal subtext which is well done, even if the identity of the father is never known. But I found myself raging at the author for not doing anything with the intriguing characters of Johnnie Walker, Col. Sanders and some of the other characters that flitter in and out of the plot.His writing is beautful thoughout and I particularly enjoyed his thoughtful characterization of the gender-bending librarian and Kafka's possible mother.It's a book that will stay in my memory, hence the three stars. But I longed for a satisfying ending with some ends tied up, and didn't get that satisfaction."
4,A lot to like,"In ""Kafka At The Shore"" there is an interplay of many elements: metaphysical, spiritual, aesthetic, emotional. There are beautiful sexual fantasies, and clinical descriptions of Kafka's penis. Like a well constructed symphony, there is a great range of voices. The novel is nicely paced, and well plotted. Murakami is adept at imagery, and does not hesitate to bring the metaphorical and impossible into the ""real"" world.At the same time, the novel does not have the emotional impact that it might, given its subject of a teenager trying to surmount the effects of a childhood without love. I also thought some parts could have been edited and tightened up such as the journey through the forest."
3,Doesn't quite deliver...,"I really liked the first half of this book. In the second half, it got needlessly weird, characters went away and/or completely changed personality for no good reason, and it just plain got difficult to WANT to read it. Don't get me wrong, I got completely wrapped up in the story--which is why I think I'm disappointed with it. In a trend common to today's writers, the ending is vague and doesn't wrap up all the loose ends--obviously the author hoping for a sequel--and the proverbial gun in the story never seems to be fired. (A common quote actually USED in the book, ""If there's a gun, eventually it will be fired."" Let's just say there's a whole, metaphorical, non-loaded arsenal here.) It's a good read, but not worth a re-read...and the ending is disappointing."
2,Lazy,"I had so much hope for this book, but it never really panned out. One can tell from the very beginning that Murakami is obviously a good writer, that's what held my interest to the end of the book. In anticipation of some great tie-in or genius event closures for all the weirdness, I was vastly disappointed in the lazy way he wrote Kafka's re-entry into his old life, and let the other characters just sort of drift off the page after nonessential drivel page after page. Too bad. Had heard such good things about him."
2,Painful Prose!,"As a word of caution, if you read novels for beautiful prose, avoid this book like the plague! It's written like a vampire novel off the young adult fiction rack. I don't know if it's Murakami or the translation; but reading Marakami's prose is like wading through sludge. Each inelegantly constructed paragraph is filled with cliches, mundane adjectives, and superflous intensifiers. If Murakami wrote like Pynchon, maybe this story would be bearable, but unduring 400 plus pages of prozaic writing in a book requiring the reader's imagination to find a point is beyond tenable. At least offer some pleasing paragraphs to entice the patient reader while he waits for a story to emerge. I'm curious how others who enjoyed this novel so much were able to get beyond the prose, because I really wanted to enjoy Marakami but couldn't."
2,Product placement and advertising cheapen this otherwise interesting read,"Had me turning the pages initially. The characters are well developed and interesting. The prose is rich and moving at times.Eventually I began to wonder about why it was important to mention that someone was driving a ""Mazda Miata"" and a ""Volkswagen Golf"" and quenching their thirst with a Pepsi (5 times in 2 pages)Companies like Pepsi and Volkswagen pay authors to place their products into their stories. (Just like in the movies) It's disgusting.It seems were forced to ingest more advertising with each passing moment.In a work of fiction by a supposed principled author, I found it disappointing and distracting to the point where I didn't want to read further."
1,Complete and utter rubbish,"I spotted Murakami's books only recently, and was excited when it came onto our writing program's reading list. So I was pretty happy to be reading this book to begin with - which usually gets me all defensive about what I'm reading....But man! This book is utter nonsense. Magic realism? Hogwash.The writing has way too much exposition, and every character starts preaching philosophy on every second page. It's ridiculous. And the point of the whole story? Who knows? It's utter nonsense! The whole things is written to cater to American audiences (there's even a scene in which these so called Japanese people are going to dial 911)Complete waste of 12 dollars, and I won't be reading any more of Murakami's work again."
4,Wallow in Depression...,"Randhir Khare turns this book to focus on the rootlessness of Anglo-Indians living in India today. In the process he manages to bring out the rootlessness of all mankind. These short stories leave you depressed, but it seems that is the intention of the author.It will take a certain frame to mind to really appreciate the feeling of sadness and melancholy imbued in the characters and events here. It feels like you are walking around an art gallery filled with somber pieces, each presenting a small slice of a small, closed, dark way of life, shunned by both the Indians and the British.What stops the book from being perfect is the same thing which gave it four stars. After a while the closedness begins to get to you. Armed with only that one simple message, it begins to feel more like a monograph than the multi-hued collection it had the potential to be."
2,Witty but far from being perfect,"A very sharp wit and a realistic approach to life in New York. It is about a Finnish model and her obsession with the disappearance of a friend. Some readers might be lost because the book talks about Finns and Finnish language a lot. I was impressed by the writer's knowledge on Finns although she is not of Finnish origin (her statements are very true!).The book starts off fast, so much that I was not able to drop it for a second, but halfway through, it became all the same. A pity, but still worth a shot for its good sarcastic humour."
5,Best Music Player for people on the go,Sony has made great improvements on it software (2004 edition is very stable). It is just as easy as itunes. If you have 1ghz processor or better don't worry about the software if you have a slower computer you may want to upgrade first. The baterry life is great. I run on a track team and I carry the music player in my spike bag. It rains some days and sometimes I have to leave it in direct sunlight. But it still works great.
3,Sony Misses the Boat,"Sony may have missed the boat with their MZ-S1 Net-MD Minidisc Walkman. First of all, it is HEAVY, over 1/2 pound with battery and minidisk. Second, it is designed to be a ""handheld"" unit which can be a bit awkard for some sport uses. Third, there are vertually no ""flat"" surfaces for mounting universal belt clip buttons. Fourth, the ""joystick"" control is quite a nifty idea , but it requires a lot of finess and practice to operate. Fifth, did I mention that it is HEAVY, weighing in at over 1/2 pound with battery and minidisk. Maybe that is the reason it is designed to be a handheld, its to heavy to carry around in a pocket or on a waist band."
1,A good idea if the software worked,"I initially bought this product on an impulse because what I wanted was not in stock and I wanted to get some tunes for my motorcycle. Well, the product is Great except for one BIG problem_____the software does not work after about 2-3 applications. I took it back and got a replacement to no avail. It still does not work. I'm taking it back to the retailer and am going to try Sony's S-2 CD Player/Reciever/MP3 unit. Do I sound bitter????You bet I am, after all the time and lost money(accessories) I've spent trying to make something work that doesn't___________work."
2,Overpriced and disappointing,"I know repition is key to learning a language but I found this set of CD's overdoes it by a long shot. The lessons are about 30 minutes each and cover only a minute amount of material in that time. Then the first 10 minutes of the next lesson is a review of the previous one, even though you are cautioned not to move to a new lesson until you have mastered the previous one. Words are broken into syllables so you can learn proper pronounciation, but the intact words are not in fact the same as the individual syllables, expecially with all the ellison that Italian employs. I think you can do much better for much less money."
2,Ridiculously expensive to teach a minimum of Italian.,"I have never understood why someone would pay $150.00 bucks to buy Pimsleur when the Teach Yourself Italian or Colloquial Italian series or Language 30 series for that matter would teach you more for $10 to $30 dollars. I guarantee that if you bought all three Pimsleur courses for $500 or so and learned all the material, you couldn't begin to carry on anything even approaching a very basic level of fluency. That's the illusion the ""Pimsleur method"" promises. It seems easy because it is. And why is it easy? Because it introduces minimum vocabulary, minimum grammar - in effect you avoid all the meaty stuff that you will need to speak the language beyond the most basic words and concepts. If you are a serious student, don't waste your money and get something that challenges you to learn what you need to learn. And if you just want to learn some simple phrases and touristy kind of stuff, buy something for $10 and save yourself a fistful of money."
2,IT WOULD NOT WORK WITH ANY OF MY SIGMA ZOOM LENS FOR CANON DIGITAL CAMERA EF MOUNT.,"I was diappointed to learn, only after receiving the unit that it was not compatible with any of my Sigma DG zoom lens for Canon EOS cameras with EF mounting. I checked and quickly found that there was no way to attach the converter to these lens. So, I had no choice but to return the merchandise. I must say that the return process provided was very simply and effective. Within only about 3 or 4 days of shipping it back at no cost, the full charge was credited to my account."
1,Could not use,I was unable to use the product as it was not compatible with the Sigma lens I had. The product description offered did not detail compatability. If it had I would have known not to order it. I must say however that I have used Sigma lenses for years and found them to be of the highest quality I was just unable to use this one.
1,Acttually I did not hate it.,"Although it was advertised as an extender for Nikon electronic cameras, it fitted none of my lenses. More detail required from the seller.Given the bewildering variety of mounts and lenses now available, advertisements need to carry a lot more detail about what an accessory does not fit. This one did not even fit my Sigma lenses. The list of lenses it did fit was comparatively short, and even these were not all fully functional (many did not support AF).Just not suitable for my needs."
2,"Not worth the money, buy a better lens instead","I spent a day photographing a sailboat race from the shore, and thought this would be an ideal time for the converter. I was using a Sigma 50-500, so with the teleconverter, I thought I was set. When I got home, I found the photos were never sharp or crisp, and just slightly blurry when zoomed in. The next night I used the same setup to take shots of the moon, with the same results. I took off the teleconverter, and I got sharper photos. If you need good crisp accurate shots (and who doesn't?), the teleconverter does not help. I don't see a point to ever use this item again. I bought my converter on E-bay for much less, but it's still not worth the money or the expectations. It's better to just save your money and get a better quality lens."
5,Sigma 2X EX DG APO Teleconverter for Nikon AF Cameras,"After reading the two reviews above, I was somewhat baffled. If you do any research on this product, you will find it clearly is made only for use with Sigma lenses, not Nikon lenses. The instruction manual that comes with the converter even lists which specific Sigma lenses to use. If you want a converter for Nikon lenses, buy the Nikon TC-20E (retails for more than twice the Sigma). Of course the quality of this product is poor when using a Nikon lens! I have a Sigma 70-200 zoom and it works beautifully; it is well worth the price."
5,Excellent and great price,"I field tested this Sigma 2X teleconverter with my Sigma 120 to 400 mm zoom telephoto lens to photograph Pulpit Rock at Cheaha State Park, AL, from 2.5 miles away. All photos from 240mm to 800mm were excellent in crispness and were taken from a tripod with remote shutter release."
1,Performance: So-So. Sound Quality: (expletive deleted),"It is reassuring to see that some reviewers of this 2-CD piece of crap are cognizant enough to notice the unforgivably horrible sound quality of this recording that should never have been released in the first place. My full review of this set is found under Volume 2. Should you choose not read it, here's the Cliffnotes version: Renaissance performs MUCH better on Live At Carnegie Hall (I think they were probably appalled & disheartened by the sound quality as they performed), and the ""sound quality"" is absolutely unbelievable--there is buzz from poor grounding and far too much feedback through nearly the entire concert to be tolerated. Either LISTEN to this recording CLOSELY before you buy it, or do yourself a huge favor and pass on it to begin with."
2,Messy,My husband couldn't wait to get a BrewStation. Even tho I don't drink coffee I agreed to have the monster on my cabinet and bought him one. It leaks!!! A constant mess on the counter. Very disapointing!I have read where others have had this problem.
2,"Good design, Bad coffee","I was desperate for a new coffeemaker and I found one of these on sale for a decent price, so I decided to give it a shot.It was easy to setup and easy to use. Everything worked properly and I had no problems with the quality of the coffeemaker or the process of setting it up.But what matters the most is: does the coffee taste good? Sadly, it did not. It tasted like chemicals and plastic. I tried four different brands of coffee, and they all had the same weird, chemicaly, plasticky taste. And yes, I did clean the coffeemaker thoroughly, following the manufacturer's instructions, before using it for the first time.I really did like the concept of this coffeemaker and the way it worked, but if the coffee is going to taste like plastic, there's no way I'm going to drink it. Back to the store it goes."
3,Great until it broke!!!,"We recently purchased this from our local Target store. I really enjoy the ease of use! Unfortunately after only two weeks it is dead. The water wont go into the ""carafe"". The bottom heating element works but the water stays cold and doesnt move. Today is Saturday so I will have to wait until Monday to contact customer service. If they will send a replacement I will try it one more time and just suffer through with my press pot in the meantime (major inconvenience with Thanksgiving next week)!!! I suggest if you buy this to tuck the box and receipt away in a closet so you can easily return it to the store when and if it dies."
1,If you're thinking of buying this...........don't,"Hands down the worst coffee maker I have ever owned. The convenience of having no carafe to fumble with is not worth it. A removable bucket that sits on top of a heating element replaces the carafe. While the bucket is much easier to clean, its handle is always unpleasantly wet when you go to remove it. Because the brewed coffee is stored inside the machine (instead of in a carafe), residual moisture becomes trapped when it is not in use, which begins to cause a funny smell and taste. After about a week of daily use my coffee started to taste like dishwater. The heating element is weak. With four cups remaining in the bucket, it takes about two hours to get it warmed up. Very disappointing overall."
1,Deceptive and False Advertising,"If you were lured by the promise of not having to replaace another carafe ever again or impressed by the picture on the box which actually shows the carafe falling on the floor, then think again. This is nothing more than false deceptive advertising. We owned this for a little over a year when the carafe (for the first time) fell from the counter onto the floor. The carafe began leaking from a small crack in the plastic. I called Hamilton Beach customer service, who could have cared less that it did fall and stated that even if were still under warrantee. They would not replace the carafe. They will however, sell replacement carafes for $16 although most glass carafes only cost $10-$12."
1,I bought the Hamilton Beach Brew Station Coffee Maker,"I bought the Hamilton Beach Brew Station Coffee Maker this Monday, today is Friday.I used it the same day and loved the ease of cleaning. This morning I made coffee and it was not even luke warm. I kept having to pour a cup and heat in microwave, then it also shut off after an hour. I got online and sent an email to Hamilton Beach customer service. The reply I got back was not acceptable. I was told to cut off the cord and ship it to them. I was also told that I would get a new unit in 4-6 weeks.What do I do in the meantime?I paid over 50.00 for this coffee maker and tomorrow I see no other option than to drive one hour to town to buy another coffee maker. What is the point in shipping me a new one if I have to buy something to use now? I will NOT buy another Hamilton Beach product."
3,A matter of taste...,"This is a nice idea and a nice looking unit, but the taste of the brew is noticeably different from what I get from my old unit with a glass carafe. I think the glass is the key. This unit brews into a plastic resevoir, and it seems that the plastic imparts some taste to the coffee.The resevoir also is not as well sealed and insulated as a standard thermos, so the coffee cools fairly quickly if you turn the brewstation off. If you leave it on, the coffee is kept warm with a heating element that produced the same burned flavor over time as leaving the carafe on the hot plate of a typical unit.So three stars for a nice idea and a good looking unit, but you sacrifice taste and it doesn't keep the brew hot long enough."
4,"Great coffeemaker, only 2 minor issues","I LOVE having no pot to worry about. The coffee stays fresh all day if necessary because air is not getting into the pot. I love the ease of use on this machine as well. Now, if someone would only come out with a way to OVER RIDE the 2 hr shut off that all coffee makers seem to have... {Nice feature if you need it, but a pain if you don't}My only 2 ""Issues"" are trivial 1. It is not tall enough to get my thermal mug under so I just put my coffee in a smaller cup and pour it in my mug. & 2. It is oddly shaped** so it doesn't really ""fit"" well in the corner of my kitchen counter.As I said though, these complaints to me, are trivial.Some people have said that theirs leaked. I've never had this problem. Not saying others don't, because I HAVE had problems with other Hamilton Beach appliances. I just know that this one is fine. Overall, I would recommend this item.**It is a very attractive coffee maker regardless of its shape."
4,Almost perfect!,"We've had this coffeemaker for 14 months and LOVE it! We never experienced any of the problems others have mentioned (leaking, broken dispenser, etc.)Two things keep me from rating the Brewstation with 5 stars. The clock is impossible to read, it's unlit and very small. Second, the pot stains very easily. Luckily, thanks to a tip mentioned by an early reviewer, we found that SoftScrub works very well!"
5,Cool product,My wife and I love this coffee maker. The coffee is simple to make and stays hot to the last drop. Clean up is a snap. I would highly recommend it.
3,Great idea but needs a little tweaking,"This is our second one of these as we really like it. However, the lid does not close as tightly as we would like. I would also like a detachable cord for easier cleaning of the entire unit."
5,It delivers!,"This book truly delivers on its title, ""Kick Start Your Dream Business"". It's full of totally practical advice and action steps that make your business a reality. He eschews business and marketing plans, focusing instead on spending time getting the business going and having the flexibility to pursue what's working (and ditch what's not).I've had my business for about a year, and wish I had the book when I started. It's been incredibly useful, also, in my latest endeavor--launching a new service within my existing business. I highly recommend it for that use, too."
5,inspirational and practical,"Kick Start Your Dream Business is a must read for any first time entrepreneur. Romanus Wolter is motivating yet pragmatic, and he takes you through the entire process of small business ownership - from developing a name to the marketing strategy. This book should be required reading for anyone thinking about turning his or her dreams into a reality. It is packed full of great ideas, completely inspirational, and a great read."
3,Mega-disappointed!,"This was hyped to be so great at growing hair especially in areas of hair loss/ shedding.This was not my experience. The product itself is nice enough, though the actual amount of product was less than I expected. I bought the small size because I only intended to try it over my small problem area. It smells great! texture is good, it will not goo up your hair, however, it just did nothing for me in terms of hair growth. I exercise daily, eat healthily, and have just a small area to the right temple that had thinned a bit. Other wise my hair is healthy and very thick and curly. I got no change, I tried it on other areas too, just in case that particular area was beyond help.I cannot say it made a difference for me at all, I even tried the method of mixing with JBCO before applying.Doesn't make my hair grow... but, as I said, it smells nice and does not leave residue."
2,concerned about the product chemical,"I have spiral curls and my hair is colored. Its kinda dry and to the middle of my back.This product did not condition my hair at all. Made it look HUGE and gave me an absolutley terrible headache. I did my version of a scientific experiment and had headaches EVERY SINGLE TIME. Last time i tried to use it just on my fingernails (my nails did grow more than ever and were strong) I had a bad headache. I had actually forgotten that I used it until a friend askded if I had used the product and then it dawned on me that I did. If you suffer from headaches, I would be cautious."
3,oy,"i am looking for this for help with my pet, sucks im having to read about it working on human hair and not many results written for pets, not much help for someone in need :("
1,Didn't received the product!,"Hello,after weeks of waiting for the product ,i didn't received the product yet even after talking to the seller.Disappointed."
2,Volunteers48,"Something has changed in the makeup of this fragrance. Bottle is different than shown as well as this is the second time I have ordered. The last was a larger bottle, so I tried the smaller one which was pictured in same bottle I had purchased a while back. The smaller bottle was not as pictured and the fragrance was also different like the larger one. I do not like the new fragrance as it is not the mild delightful smell as a while back. Even people have noticed the fragrance has changed as I wear it."
3,Professional Bandsaw?,"Not anywhere near ""professional"" quality but pretty good for around $260 when Lowe's had the clearance sale. Mine was off about 1/8"" between the lower and upper wheels, not coplanar that is. Delta tech support said it doesn't have to be coplanar if it tracks ok and no way to adjust it. A local guy at the woodshop store said it could be adjusted for coplanar with a shim washer - I guess Delta don't want you to touch the wheels.Anyway, its way underpowed, unable even resaw 4"" dry soft wood gracefully with a new 1/2"" blade. The lower wheel collects a lot of sawdust with much of it sticking to the tire - no dust collection yet. It labors and vibrates throughout the resaw process. It needed a wheel brush, fence and a larger motor. I think it will be ok when I adjust it for coplanar and replace with a larger motor."
1,Poor Fit and Finish - Not happy with Saw,"The fit and finish on this product is poor. Installation was difficult because few if any of the holes/bolts aligned up. Rough overall quality. Once I spent several hours wrestling with the saw too make things fit and cranked up the saw it banged and clanked like it had thrown a rod. I had to do much more adjustment and modification to get the saw to run smoother and it still sounds rough today. Additionally, the brackets that the table top sits/tilts on are made of thin cast iron and they break easily. I have replaced them twice already and I have only used this saw lightly. No re-sawing, just small cutting."
3,great bay area mix-----,this is a classic bay area mix with the only downside being way too much banter by the dj and his mock radio station tape mix theme
4,the rodney dangerfield of hip hop...,"this is a great compilation album and is def worth the purchase. Thes One has some surefire bangers on here that should not be slept on. My fav tracks: The Swass 10, Yacht Club, Eye to Eye, Noonen, and Back to the Grind . I crack up everytime i hear the swass 10 (does anyone know if unseasoned waffle fries are still IN?), and always have to rewind it. There are quite a few references to the movie Caddyshack that i didnt pick up on at first because i had never actually sat through the whole movie. but if youve seen it before, you will def be able to place the snippets that are sprinkled througout. Go head and hit the purchase button on this one."
5,A Great Gift Book for Development of Leaders.,"Success in life depends on the level of leadership and guidance which you develop within yourself and then are able to express to others. This book is beyond business principles and has many tried and true systems which can be adopted for everyday peak performance and courageous attitude. His ventures have led him back to the essence of network marketing; help enough people achieve their dreams, develop their talents, and listen to their missions, your life will become richer, more rewarding and encompass enhanced meaning. As a manager and leader in Espial, USA I gift this book to all my new enrollees. Thank you Amazon.com for offering this title."
4,Good choice for the price.,"I purchased this saw as an emergency replacement one night. Paid $271 at Lowes. I feel I got my moneys worth from this purchase. Many saws I looked at were much cheaper feeling for more money. I rate this saw as a homeowner model, its really too weak for every day use. It will just pull my 8"" dado, you have to go slow. It rips 1x4""s well and thats what I cut the most. Overall its a great saw for what you get if its $300 or less. It did better than expected. I actually got the fence to square up on the first try. The best low priced saw I've seen."
2,slater keeps this at bay,"this is really an awful movie but I like it because of Slater's performance which is the best thing in this film. Pesci is ok as Hollywood. but dont find anything special about this piece, only for Slater's work as the blank man who repeats himself over again and he does his character well. the end is stupid. plus its upped a notch by the cameo at the end by Harrison Ford."
3,"Comfy, but too soft","As a side sleeper, I think this pillow is way too soft. I find myself fluffing it in the middle of the night and I usually sleep through everything. I've been sleeping on it for two weeks now, and have yet to notice a difference in my neck pain. I won't give up on it yet, though! If you prefer a softer pillow, I would recommend this one."
4,Great Pillow,"Very pleased with this purchase. Pillows stay plump, soft with support. I get the support I like with this plump shape holding pillow."
5,Where's The Beef?,"I ordered this cd not to long ago, and it's really great!!! I'm a big fan of Green Day, and with Billie Joe helping sing in this band is really noticable. It's a really great cd and you really need to buy it if you're a Green Day fan. Also, buy they're other cds....they're great too!!!"
5,Very Readable,"As an engineering student trying to specialize in sigal processing, I found my mathematics background filled with holes. I embarked upon a journey to try to fill these holes and discovered what disservice my engineering education had done to me in terms of dealing with abstract notions like probability theory, etc. This book has been indispensible in re-engaging not only my anlytical skills but also continue on my path to a better understanding of the mathematics required to succeed professionally. Thank you, Prof. Abbott!"
2,Definitively this is not the supertramp best album,"As a very fan of Supertramp since I had 13 years old I had all supertramp almbums and definitively this is not their best. I think that the best works of Supertramp were the result of the combination of Roger Hodgson and Davies. I think it does not fix well with supertramp their radical change of style. When you listen to this album, except for one or two song it is difficult for the listener to distinguish the former supertramp style. Brother where you bound? was an excellent album even whitout Hodgson participation, but this one has a lack of something else"
2,THERE WORST YET.,SUPERTRAMP HAS NOT BEEN THE SAME SINCE FRONT RUNNER ROGER HODGSON LEFT THE BAND. HIS SOLO STUFF SOUNDS MORE LIKE SUPERTRAMP THAN SUPERTRAMP DOES. WE NEED MORE FROM HODGSON.
4,Sub Text,"I have watched the movie a number of times and had fun reading the script. The subtext is a riot. I think most thinkers will ""get"" it."
3,Great content - really tiny print,"Double Indemnity is perhaps the greatest Film Noire. With a screenplay by Wilder and Raymond Chandler, it should be. And I like to ""get under the hood"" of my favorite movies, read the words, get a sense of what went on behind the camera.This doesn't disappoint - it's as powerful a read as one could wish. But the print is really tiny - too small for me to read. I got the same content in Library of America Raymond Chandler - that version isn't formatted as a screenplay, so that's lost. But the print - for me - made up for it."
2,"Not the greatest, better than nothing","I bought this to replace a Shopsmith bandsaw. The most aggrevating problem is the lack of availability of quality blades. All the problems everyone has had with not being able to cut straight I had with the Shopsmith. I was able to solve the problem by purchasing better (i.e. not Vermont America or Olsen) blades. I found that the silicon steel blades solved the problem, but alas, they are not available for this Delta 9"". I use this saw to cut blanks for my lathe, mainly for making pens, pencils, etc. Even with a new blade, the unit does not have the power (stops) to cut 8/4 stock.I did manage to resolve all the problems of this saw - I purchased a 14"" Jet."
1,Let the buyer beware -,"I purchased this BS100 band saw as NEW from Amazon.com. I received in its place a used and damaged band saw. An attempt had been made - unsuccessfully - to repair the damaged top of the table. The plastic insert around the saw blade was damaged and discolored. The table top had huge saw marks in the table top slot. It appears that Amazon must be getting these Delta products from a gray market source that repackages used, damaged and defective products. Delta advised me that they do not ship saws in this condition. The Amazon motto should be ""Let the buyer beware""."
4,Inexpensive table saw worth every penny,"A starter saw that helped put the finishing touch on a beautiful cabinet installation convinced me to come out of woodworking retirement and attack a complete kitchen remodel. Yes it's inexpensive and could use a bigger table, but for a portable saw to cut cabinet trim pieces and other small projects, it is great. Sure I'll be spending [$$$] for a Jet next year but this was worth the minimal bucks today."
2,The Marvelous Margaret Rutherford Steals the Show: The VIPS,"The VIPS is in a word overdone, overacted, and a heavily veiled soap opera... Burton, Taylor, and Jordan all give performances way beneath their normal high quality range. These three seem to be sleepwalking through the production. At least Taylor looks wonderful; that's something. Fortunately, the film is saved by the terrific Margaret Rutherford as the Duchess, who walks off with the entire production and an Academy Award...Brava!!! In all fairness, Maggie Smith gives her usual solid performance;but it is Rutherford's film."
5,happy men,"I am more than pleased to learn new sexual ancient techniques to pleasure and rejuvinate my Jade Dragon. As an erotic writer, I needed to go to deeper levels of pleasure. And this book of ancient techniques has many formulas, behaviors and spiritual reasonings for his White Tigress! Health, pleasures, excitement and harmony - all wrapped up in one! I could not have imagined such renewal and details existed. Buy the companion book re the White Tigress. Then a true completion and understanding will form your lives. However, be prepared to practice some stimulating ideas....."
2,"Sound is not good, energy lackidasical,","Even though this cd features the best guitarist Motorhead ever had in Brian Robertson (ex of Thin Lizzy), the sound is poor, that it probably would not have been considered a good bootleg.Furthermore the energy isn't happening, an off night for the bandI have a cd called Live 83, (not a bootleg) from an independent label featuring from the same lineup which is far superior in sound and energyAs well this Cd includes an interview which is a cheap way of making up space on a cd"
3,Under powered and broken drive belt first week of use,"It is an ok machine for the light use home shop. However it is under powered and under built for anything besides sanding the edge of a 1x3. I was sanding some paint off a 1x3 piece of pine, with 50 grit very corase paper. To much pressure and the machine would bog down. Careful as I was to keep the pressure light, let the motion and paper do the work, the drive belt fell apart. I decided to write the review while I was herelooking for a new belt (or perhaps a 6 pack). Note purchased at local hardware store, for a few dollar more then Amazon price."
1,Don't Buy Cheap Tools!,"This is a very low quality tool. Not even a hobbiest level in my book. In a word, it's ""garbage"". No power, no bite, terrible vibration and the disk sander is useless. As a matter of fact, it wasn't long after I started using this sander that the disk just started spinning freely with no torque at all. It's run off a thin little belt driven by the motor instead of a direct connection. Any resistance (like sanding!) and it burns the belt and that's all she wrote. The belt sander is better but it bogs down with not too much pressure too. I can't believe Delta needs to sell this stuff and ruin their otherwise good name. But it's my fault for buying cheap tools. I won't ever do that again. You don't get what you don't pay for."
2,Grainy & Gross,"I make fruit/veggie smoothies everyday and normally use a whey protein powder. I tried this soy protein out and it was definitely a big disappointment. Super grainy and leaves a strange aftertase. Also, it doesn't blend well in a blender...the smoothies came out with a very liquid consistency rather than creamy and thick like a smoothie should be."
1,Does not dissolve well,"I wanted a unflavored, neutral tasting protein powder to add to soups and oatmeal to give me a little bit a protein boost. Alas, the NOW Sports Soy Protein Isolate Powder has too much of a talcum consistency. It does not dissolve well using a spoon and forms lots of clumps. Also, it has a strong ""processed"" taste that changes the flavor of things I've added it too. It is not neutral , and biting into a clump is particularly unpleasant.Maybe it works better in a blender but it was not the protein for my purpose."
2,Not the best experience :(,"It tastes good and mixes well, but the HUGE spoon that comes with it is almost impossible to use without doing a mess. Besides that, it made me go to the bathroom too often. I won't buy it again. There are better ones out there."
3,Not the best quality,"I typically buy these pumice sponges from The Body Shop and they work really well and last a long time. In fact, they often just get moldy from the moisture in the shower before anything else. I figured that would be the case with this brand but after a single use, I noticed that it was wearing away REALLY quickly. It seems to disintegrate very quickly, leaving yellow pumice bits all over the place. It's just a lot softer than the one from the Body Shop. I probably wouldn't buy this one again."
2,Great at first but fell apart quickly,"I did like the pumice for a week or so, but it fell apart (into small pieces) very quickly. Just not worth the money overall, as it did not last long."
1,Doesn't live up to its promise,"This book doesn't live up to its promise. I was so pleased to order it and receive it, and then I was so disappointed with what I got. Lord save us from self-conscious design like this. It also seems that Mr. Wolf only wants you to learn to see BEIGE. Blah."
3,500VA ain't much,"... at least for a normal desktop and monitor. (My system draws about 150W and drains the battery in less than 11 minutes, but I guess that's expected.) My main issue is the long recharge cycle. 24h for from 0 to 100% is a little long. No conclusive self test and no way to clear log after some testing to figure out the stamina dim the otherwise good software. (Using XP)"
3,Serial Killers of the Middle Ages,"This book is an example of the Victorian type of scholarship that ropes in everything that could concievably have something to do with the topic at hand. This means you get lots of interesting things around the edges. It should have made the book longer though. I was rather disappointed. This is why I only gave the book 3 stars. It's great stuff but the book should be thicker.A lot of the material centers on medieval France. It becomes pretty clear that what was known as a 'werewolf' at that time was what we would now call a 'serial killer' of a certain type, a modern example being Jeffrey Dahlmer. I wound up giving my copy to a friend who is an amateur criminologist, to be shared with her daughter the vampire expert."

Timothy O'Keefe's The Spicy Camp Cookbook is a wonderful compendium of delicious and easy to prepare recipes especially suited to just such occasions.

1,Broken Lathe,I received my Lathe today by UPS. It was damaged in the shipping process. Has anyone else had this problem????
1,BAD BAD BAD PRODUCE,"This is a bad wireless mouse that i have ever used before. It only work in the first 2 days when i received it, then the mouse stop working unreasonably. All the buttons still work fine but the mouse cannot move. I checked everything, the battery, the software, everything is fine. I think the laser sensor is broken. I can't believe that it's very easy to broke and i can only use it in 2 days."
5,A Broadway Diva - Debbie Gravitte,"What can I say about Debbie Gravitte that hasn't alreay been said? Ms. Gravitte is one of the leaders of Broadway Show music interpretation. I have the distinct pleasure of seeing Ms. Gravitte on the stage. I remember years ago - seeing Debbie in Denver in Zorba. I remember her sensational rendition of the song ""Life Is"". I performance I have remembered many years later. Several years ago I witnessed Ms. Gravitte thrilling a audience in Arvada, CO with the premiere performance of Defying Gravity . I knew from that moment on the the music from Wicked was going to be truly special. Thank you Debbie Gravitte. Please, please don't loose your humor and I'm looking forward to seeing you on the Great White Way again."
5,Best Bag Ever!,This bag has everything a Mom needs. I especially love the straps that allow you to hang it off the back of a stroller or shopping cart. The parent section is great and there are two ways in to the main section. It fits everything I need and my husband doesn't mind carrying it. I am a very orgaized person and the little pockets inside and out of the main section helps me keep things where I can find them.
3,Yumalicious!,"This stuff is very tasty and convient. If you are willing to fork the money over for something you are simply going to drink, then definitely buy some."
5,Elephant Orphans,"I bought Orphans of Tsavo in 1967, when I worked at Kilaguni Lodge in Tsavo West. I had been to see the orphans at Tsavo East.It is a brilliant written book and fasinating to read. People often think what a wonderful life Daphny Sheldrick must have had living in a National Park. It was an unforgetable time for her and her husband but also a very hard one. Please read the book and see for your self that it is not as easy as it looks. It also shows you how diffecult and frustrating it can be to look after wild baby animals. How do you comfort them and what to feed. It is a really brilliant book."
1,Not worth your time anymore,"I was once a subscriber and avid fan of the Economist, but sadly my eyes were opened to how they'll print anything to sell more copy when they endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 American presidential election. At this point I wouldn't be surprised to see an article from them declaring Hugo Chavez to be a swell guy, and capitalism to be a mistake."
3,"In depth and original, yet dull","""The Economist"" is a scholarly news magazine with a focus on the economic side of things. It streams in each week with many overlong articles. You could dedicate an entire evening or two reading the magazine cover to cover, but you probably wouldn't want to. Many of the articles aren't of general interest, but may be up the alley of a macroeconomist. The publisher appears to long for a globalized free-market world. A good magazine for some, perhaps, but not for many, I would say.I would recommend ""The Week"" and ""U.S. News and World Report"" instead of ""The Economist."""
2,Faulty Unit: Great Picture,"This unit caused us difficulty from the word go!! It gets stuck in the middle of playing a DVD and then when it moves again, it just scrolls through the menu options. I contacted Zenith and they are sending a replacement. I hope the new one works!! It is a shame, because the unit was easy to set up and the picture and sound quality are great."
2,Crapped out after 12 months,"This product looked good and worked well for the short run, but after 12 months shut down and was trash. I guess the quality they put in was only a twelve month supply. Look elesewhere for the long term.TORR"
1,Good for about a year,I had the unit for just under a year and it stopped reading DVDs. That was my one and only shot at Zenith. The player was used very little and it is not worth getting serviced since it is past 90 ay warranty.
2,Happy for only 14 months,"I purchased this unit after much research and was very happy with its operation until it stopped working after 14 months of average use. Then the unit refused to read any DVD. The inside was clean and the laser was clean and functional. I've always respected Zenith products, but I think this one was a lemon. I hope to hear from Zenith in the near future."
4,Cute Table!,"Once the table is put together its too cute, seems very sturdy and is nice quality. The only issue was putting the table together. The sticks you use to hold the baskets were soooooo hard to screw into both sides of the table. The holes were so tight trying to get the screws in that you had to use serious muscle...and breaks in between...to get it done. If that could be made easier then the table can be put together in no time. I'm still glad I got it."
5,Very cute table!,"We just recieved this table as a gift for my sons, and we love it. Easy to put together and very sturdy. The bins are great to keep their crayons and stuff.."
5,Sturdy and attractive,I am very impressed with how sturdy and well made this set is. The wood is solid and is sure to last a long time. It's also gorgeously designed and fits in well in our home without looking cheap or tacky. It was simple to put together but there are a lot of screws and my arm was getting quite sore!
3,3 stars,"This Delta Sander is very quiet and smooth and the workmanship appears to be good. The table top is flat.On the negative side, the dust collection is poor. The power is adequate for a home shop."
5,Pocket watch chain !,"For the price...this is a steal.Looks great with my wife's grandfather's 100 year old gold pocket watch.Although not solid gold, it fits the bill untilwe can afford the ""real"" thing !Very pleased with this purchase."
4,Increases testosterone when taken with other test boosters,"Tribulus is a very effective supplement but not something to take by itself. It works as a catalyst to other supplements to make them more effective. I've taken trib for the gym but have always stacked it with some other form of testosterone booster, and it works. I've also taken it with DAA,Tribulus Terrestris 90% Bulk Powder 25 Grams + FREE Primaforce D-Aspartic Acid 100 Grams. For more enhanced performance in the bedroom, they work better together than apart."
1,VOICES OVERDUBED,"I have the VHS version of this film and is the original Movie but with one exception. All of the voices have been overdubbed by American speaking people. NOT American speaking Japanese people. The voices are so bad, that some are duplicated among different actors in the movie. The Japanese version is excellent, worth watching."
4,Very nice,I bought it for my wife on her 30th b-day. She loved it! It was a great price for the value I got. Great seller too.I recommend.A
3,Don't feel much different,When I first got this CD I think it did help a little--I actually went on an audition and felt great. I've had it now for a month and have listened to it several times but it doesn't seem to be doing anything anymore. Maybe I've built an immunity to it.
2,Instructions,I need instructions for installation and operation of the Bell bicycle speedometer. Can you email them to me. Thank you.
1,It never worked!,I had my bos buy one after seeing it on T.V.Boy was that a mistake...it had no suction. I ended up taking all the area rugs and shaking them outside so I wouldn't have to admit I had been fooled by a commercial.
2,no thanks,Good on bare floors but not good for carpeting or even small rugs and runners. My 10 year old vacuum with a broken height/pile adjuster worked way better than this one.
1,Not happy.,"This thing will not pick up anything but tiny dust! No lint, no hair, no crumbs. It's very frustrating. I can hear it working hard, but the floor remains the same. Then it gets hot and shuts off. Don't buy this item; it will make you very sad."
1,I'm dissapointed,"It takes alot of work to get this little vacumn to pick up pet hair on a low pile rug, I have to sit down on the floor and use the crevice tool ( after piling it up with my hand) to get any picked up, forget the floor attachment it's virtually ,useless. Now the ONLY thing this vacumn is good for is for bare floors and only using the hand attachments. The floor attachment just flings it around the room.I sure wish I hadn't purchaed mine through Speigel as I'm unsure how to get a refund. Oh and the filter is looking pretty worn out and I've only had it for 6 months.( I was looking for a new one when I came across this site) SAVE your money and buy something else.P.S. I've yet to find any vacumn cleaner that picks up pet hair effectively that doesn't cost a month's salary."
1,Rip -off,"Considering buying this vacuum? Then just throw the money out the window. I was so disapointed by this vacuum. It does not pick up pet hair, it doesn't even pick up lint. It's very good at picking up dust, but, that's all. It also if FABULOUS at getting over-heated very fast. If you are looking for a great waste of money, and a fabulous workout from all the back and forth motion of desperately trying to get this to pick ANYTHING up off of a rug, this is the machine for you. If you're looking for a reliable light-weight vacuum -- look else where."
2,"Acceptable as broom alternative, useless as vacuum","I have two very small rugs that I need to vacuum occasionally, and this unit was not up to the task. In fact, its performance was abysmal, and I'm anything but a neatnick. This picks dust up from my hardwood floors without any problem, but I'm perfectly content to use a normal broom to handle that, and there are plenty of cordless options if you need a broom alternative. In the end, I'm not sure if this product's existence serves any purpose."
4,Very convenient,Very nice and convenient. Little bit too slow writing. I'm not using Sony compress software.
1,Slower than slow,"I wanted this ""thumb"" drive to work, but it is so slow as to be unuseable (anout USB 1.1 speed)."
5,Sad,"I was saddened to read about Christines struggle and eventual death of cystic fibrosis. This book does a great job of showing you the decline, and we watch as her lungs deteriorate until there is no quality of life left. It was awful because she loved life so much and knew what was happening to her and what she was missing out on.Some things bugged me-like her mother seemingly putting her love life ahead of Christine, and vacationing when Christine was dying in a hospital room...but it doesn't keep me from recommending the book because I loved Christine. I'm sad to see it is now out of print.Christine's beauty and strength really shined through. I wonder what her mom and sister are doing now."
1,wrong item shipped,"order these hooks (TWICE!) and they sent shower curtains (TWICE!), i believe the listing is wrong they mean to say shower curtain and not shower curtain ""hooks!"""
4,informative read,I bought the book as a gift for my wife and she found some of the lessons informative. Some of the lessons were common sense but others we interesting bits of knowledge most people never stumble across in every day life but are very helpful.
3,"OK, but flimsy","I needed to replace a 96 inch fixture and decided to replace it with two 48 inch ones. The Amazon description of this fixture also stated it had a pull string on/off switch, this was not ture. I called Amazon and told them of the mis-information. I kept the fixtures because I needed them and needed them now. Amazon as always was there with me and gave me ten dollars off my next order. Not everything you buy online is 100% but with Amazon you have great customer service."
3,"Four-star light, 1-star packaging","These are nice, well built lights at a reasonable price. The problem is in the packaging. They are shipped in a very thin cardboard box. They will probably get damaged, at least a little bit, on their way to you. So far I've bought three. The first was mangled, the second dented only slightly, and the third arrived in perfect condition. Obviously I think the quality, once I receive a light that is usable, is worth the headache of dealing with returns/exchanges until then. You'll have to decide if that's true for you as well."
1,Very Cheaply Made,"I ordered two of these lights to use over work benches in my barn. As soon as I unpacked the first one, I noticed the fixture was broken so I returned it for replacement. I did not get a chance to hang the second one for a couple of days. When I did, I found it to be defective as well. First, it was difficult to get the bulbs installed. It would have been impossible had I been trying to install them after hanging it. When I finally did get the bulbs in, it did not work. Apparently some sort of electrical problem. The replacement for the fixture I returned arrived today. It works okay so I am keeping but not happy with the quality of workmanship. I am returning the other one for credit. With only one out of three working, it is simply not worth it to give this product another chance. I will try a different brand. I cannot recommend this one. As usual, however, Amazon made the returns easy."
2,boring,"it was at times cute, but just didnt make it as a great comedy. Now, the girl/character who plays the spoiled teenage girl is awesome! great very believable spoiled brat acting! and the great character actress who plays the mom who opens up the crystal shop is super hilarious! those two make the whole show! way better, than the starring dad and daughter who are kinda lame, just not strong characters or at all funny."
3,Good for Technical Ideas but not for Improving your Reps.,I was a little disappointed because I was looking for ideas for improving the performance of my Call Center Reps and this book deals strickly with technical performance such as Computers and Phone Systems. If your not already familiar with some of these systems then it will give you some good ideas.
1,Don't waste your money,This is an over-hyped piece of junk. It does not have much suction and does not hold but a thimbleful of debris.
2,Not a great buy.,"This was given as a gift, and while it seems to have a lot of sucking power, the compartment is small and fills up quickly. I think I need another vacuum just to suck the filter clean.It runs hot and loud.I use it to clean dog hair off the couch, and the machine doesnt do the work, the brush and I do the work. I have to keep cleaning off the brush and putting it in the vacuum.There's gotta be something better out there for small cleanups. I definately dont recommend whole room cleaning!"
1,Shark? more like a guppy!,"Hunk of junk. At full charge (in the charger for days unused) the thing stops picking up dirt after 45 seconds and is totally dead in less than a 1 minute, no exagerating."
2,Indifferently recorded.,"Some of the tracks are a bit interesting, a couple quite good, the rest are lifeless and somewhat boring. I was hoping for a bit more punch but Tina seems a bit too laid back. I have not decided whether some of the songs were poorly chosen or it is the arrangement which is lacking. Much talent, much potential, little delivered."
1,Does not work,I used this a couple of times. I just tried to use it a third after only having it 6 months and it will not pump.
4,A Useful Gathering of Anglo American Tales,"Having looked at this book with my primary interest in the experiences of the common soldier in mind, I am struck with the many interesting personal narratives herein. That said, I was disappointed to some extent that there were not any narratives from opponents or from other allies whose native tongue is not English. Perhaps this was the author's purpose, perhaps he did not have source permissions, or perhaps the publisher did not want to acquire rights to other stories.That said, although this is therefore a one sided view, it has much literary merit and deserves a place in the personal narrative collection.I would also recommend the author's own personal narrative of service as an aviator. Flights of Passage (c.f.)"
5,Memphis Grizzlies PJ Pants,I bought these as a gift for my husband and he really enjoys them. They are the perfect size and are very comfortable.
1,Bait and Switch,I have ordered this item in the past. It shipped exactly as shown and it was a decent quality of matcha. When I recently reordered this product they switched it out with a sub quality version that tastes like swamp water. The packaging is different as well. I am really disappointed.
2,"Bad acting, lack of amazonian physicality...","First of all, if you watch this just to see lots of female flesh, then you aren't going to be disappointed. However, if you are expecting a coherent plot, good dialog, or exiting fight scenes, then you will be sorely disappointed. The lines these characters deliver are worse than old Tarzan flicks, and the Amazons do very little in the way of stunts or fighting. It's like the actresses were all afraid to risk breaking a nail or two. When the heroes have to escape from the prison, the expected overpowering of the guards simply does not happen. Even a hoped-for mass wrestling match between the amazons and a bunch of African warriors also does not happen. That is why I almost always find amazon themed flicks disappointing. This one is no exception."
2,"Hand Mixer, only if you are 8 feet tall","I bought this without researching it, I bought the mixer original for my 2 year daughter.... So she could help in the kitchen. Needless to say the mixer is large, uncomfortable to hold, and about the length of my arm.... It works great whipping eggs, but it is diffcult to use. I am in the process of buying another hand mixer, which will be a bit more ptetit. Since I need something I can use, without feeling like I am doing strength training.... The thing is huge, I have not trained the onion attachment, since I already have a wonderful food processor that does my onion chopping for me.... Did I mention how huge this mixer is :-D"
3,not bad,i had first heard of 60 ft dolls from a freind that had this cd. When i listened to it i thought that it was great music. the 1 thing that it lacks is a hardcore song. on all punk rok cd's you need to have at least 1 hardcore song that you could mosh to. they are a good sissy punk band like Lagwagon but they would be better off being more hardcore punk.
5,VINCENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I love Vincent. He's one of my favorite characters from Final Fantasy and this action figure is one of the best figures I have ever had. It has a lot of detail and it looks exactly like him. It sits on my shelf in my bedroom and it looks perfect with my other Final Fantasy figures. I'm very glad I have this because Vincent is AWESOME!!!!
3,Cool,"I keep him on my shelf with my other ones... he's pretty durable, but a PAIN to dust! It sticks to his cloak. LOL."
3,Very Mixed,"This book started off magically for me. I thoroughly enjoyed the beginning and found a few sections quite moving. However, I'm not sure that the same level of poetry is sustained throughout, and by the end there's an extremely long chunk of dialogue which struck me a clumsy device for Linda to share her New Age views on the universe. I'm surprised this hasn't been commented on more, as I found it rather jarring and bizarre considering how the rest of the book was handled. That being said, I've never read a book quite like this one. It's quite special at it's finer moments, so I might be inclined to read it again in a few years even it does blatantly try to shove some New Age mumbo down the viewer's throat."
2,Surprised,"We received the padlock, but discovered that no key was included. We called the seller and learned that the key was sold separately even though it was shown in the Amazon picture of the padlock. It's hard to be enthusiastic about buying a key separately and paying additional postage for it also."
2,"Good idea, poor follow-through","I was so ready to love this book. As a teacher with predominantly Mexican-American students, I am very concerned about their success and I hoped to learn and understand.Instead, I was exposed to shoddy research and theory. Valenzuela's agenda was so upfront throughout all her research and analysis that she never paused to consider other explanations. In the words of Non Sequitur comics of late, she is a ""preconceptual scientist."" She makes sweeping generalizations and accusations which are not supported in her data. She leads her informants' answers, she jumps on the anti-school bandwagon, and she doesn't do her background research - such as developing theory of caring.I like the premise, which is why I was so very disappointed at the extremely weak scholarship that this book represents. Her heart is in the right place, and it's where my heart is, too - but that is never an excuse for such sloppy research and theory."
3,Tracks??,"I also think would be helpful to have a track listing. There is a great music selection in the movie. The ""flashback"" scene is also very appealing to me. The music fits it perfectly to add the sort of mood and feeling to the scene. If anyone has a track listing, or knows that name of that song during the flashback, please make a post. Enjoy!"
3,Jazzy Fun.,"Perhaps I was a little disappointed when every song didn't have the immediate effect that their break-out hit ""Hell"" has. But it is rich in its commitment to being wholly sucked into the 1920s and 30s jazz style."
5,Regency Romance at its best,"I found this book a delightful surprise - well drawn characters, good story lines and lots of fun. I found myself laughing out loud at the antics and the conversations. Something I haven't done since Georgette Heyer. I will definitely be on the lookout for more books by Ms Benson."
2,A bore...,"I did not enjoy this book. I did not find it humorous, romantic, or educational. It was a chore to read. I did not care about the h/h or any of the minor characters. To call the ""plot"" contrived would be an understatement. I truthfully cannot think of any reason to spend your time or your money on this book and I regret that I did both."
3,"Good Effort, Not quite there yet","Michael Thomas Ford's first novel tries very hard to be optimistic at best and vague at worst. I wish that Ford would have cut half of the characters or at least not given them to us in a barage. So many great characters are undeveloped and it's as if the reader sort of knows them. The only truly developed character is Josh and the reader must trust the narrator to explain why the other satellites are orbiting around P-Town. Ford does a fantastic job with the setting and the sense of place. His description of character actions harkens back to his essays and work quite well for him here. As with Masters of Midnight, Ford expresses his English Major roots by citing who his sources-- which in this case are Shirley Jackson(Midnight) and Armistead Maupin (Summer). A wonderful summer read, I just want to go back and get to know the gang a bit more . . ."
3,Enjoyable character-heavy summer novel,"I really enjoyed this book, but thought it could be better. While some of the characters and plot directions are just excellent(Josh & Doug, Emmeline & Toby, Jackie) others seemed so completely superfluous (Marly, Ryan)that they barely intersected with the main narrative and seemed designed merely to pad out the book. Still, pleasant enough and worth reading."
4,Why stop at 400 pages!!!,"I have never enjoyed a Key West vacation more than one I just returned from....relaxing in a swinging hassock, wind blowing gently while I read this most wonderful book. This being my first gay read, I was expecting to be 'entertained' by superficial stereotypes that become boring soon after the first introductions. I could not have been more wrong.Simply put... very good job. I do hope a follow up book is currently being written."
2,Not convenient to use,"I have no doubt that this is high quality and pure, but applying it to the skin is not very easy. The texture is thick (imagine butter) and it leaves skin greasy and I have to wait a long time before I can put clothes on. I end up being too lazy to use this and used other lotions (which contains some shea butter). Maybe pure shea butter is not the most practical skin care product to use."
4,Nice Puzzler,My wife really enjoys her addictive Picross DS. Hours of picross puzzling fun just like in your favorite pulp puzzle book with all the DS touch-screen kewlness.
3,Works great but bristles are brittle,"I just purchased my second Hot Tools curling brush. I really like the appliance, but the bristles are very brittle and break very easily. I found out (after my second purchase!) that replacement bristles can be purchased directly from the manufacturer (Helen of Troy). A phone call to the company helped 1-800-487-8769."
2,replacement bristle hassle,"Like alot of customers with this product, I need to replace the bristles. After calling Helen of Troy Company and waiting on hold for 10 min, I was informed that the only way to replace the bristles is to write to the company and send a check. They do not take orders over the phone or on-line. The real kicker is that it takes 4-6 weeks to recieve the bristles...are you kidding? I guess they are hoping I find it easier to replace the curling iron, and I will.....but it won't be their product!!!"
3,Solid Textbook,"Has a nice selection from the rhetorical masters and covers its bases rather well. You've got all your basics, from Plato to Cicero to Locke. However, as this is the first edition, I wouldn't suggest getting it unless your professor pointedly asks for it. Several important pieces are missing from this one that appear in the second edition and vice versa. This means that it is impossible to sell back afterward. Good uses for it range from paperweight to missile. You could probably kill an assailant with it if you chunked it at them."
3,Rhet Trad,Nothing special - needed it for class.Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
1,A Witness to typical Serbian Propaganda and Lies,If I could I would of rated this book a negative 5 but Amazon does not give that option. I waited over a month to get the book to find out that its nothing more than the same propaganda that has been written for the past 50 years. This book just copies the age old stories that was written during the Tito regime to deplict Croats as savage beasts. I was hoping after all these years that there would be a book that told the truth about Jasenovac and what happened there. This book is nonsence and does not have any historical benifit except a few old aged photos that have been published over and over again. Even the photos have been proven as being altered. Not worth a dime not worth a day of reading not worth typing this complaint. Only worth while thing is if you are interested in Serbian Communist Partizan Propaganda.
4,To: A Music Fan,"The song that you are talking about, the ""Naughty Naughty Christmas"" song, was performed by Danger Danger. I liked this song as well, and was disappointed when I saw it wasn't on this CD, but it is still a good CD for anyone who liked the songs from the movie. It was a great christmas gift for my little brother. He loved the movie and watches it all year 'round. It's a great CD though, despite what Disney left off."
3,I Like What I Know: A Visual Autobiography,"Vincent Price was much more than just a Hollywood ghoul. Price was an enormously refined gentleman and a serious art collector. This book is charming in that it is so personal, yet it lacks the stringent outlines of either a true autobiography or a serious discussion of art."
3,"OK, but not that great","I was very disappointed with this book. They touted it as ""light"" recipes (according to the title of the book), yet many of the recipes only reduced the calories of the original recipes by only a few calories per serving. The other problem I have with these recipes is how incredibly labor intensive some of them are. The recipe makeover for Chicken Parmesan is absolutely ridiculous!! If you want a cookbook of healthy recipes that a working person can actually prepare on a weeknight get the latest Ellie Krieger or Evelyn Tribole cookbooks. If you want to get this cookbook, just make sure that you have hours devoted to preparing extremely labor intensive recipes!"
4,"Must Reading, AARP how it screws older Americans","As a former employee, all I can say is READ it and find out some of truth about this two-faced monster that rips off the old and sells out the young. The book is the tip of the iceberg. Van Atta did a good job, and the ""Larry King Live"" Interview will answer a lot of unaddressed questions. Read it and cancel your membership that will send a message to these money hungry swine!!"
5,Nonfiction at its best!,"This is a nonfiction story about a minister's walk through a dark valley in his life and how it affected and changed his life. How he drew closer to God, reframed sorrow into hope and how all the misgivings of having someone in your life with a chronic illness can alter and change your perspectives. I would consider this a must read for anyone going into compassionate care or pallative care such as Hospice. The authors becomes transparent and human letting you know what it is like to walk the life of a pastor in terrible times."
2,Ok as it WAS,"Don't get me wrong, I think Thalia is great and that she has a great talent in her hands. But lately it seems that she's been following trends and not setting them like she used to. Shakira had a great crossover, so she decided to go ahead and do it with an Ashanti-like song called ""I Want You"" with Fat Joe. Now that she returned to her Spanish language singing she decides to relaunch her already great CD with some bonus tracks. I have the original album and if you have that one, that should be enough. What they don't mention is that by adding 4 tracks they have removed 4, three English song and the Selena remake of ""Amor Prohibido"".Seriously the CD was Ok as it was, the only way I would see someone buying this one in addition the original is if he or she were a die-hard Thalia fan."
3,OK,Much more mainstream than I expected. It isnt half as good as the first CD from Trick Pony. Im not likely to play it too often.
5,Kind of a surprise,"I have to admit, even tho I like the bag, I was surprised at how light weight it is. I'm a little concerned about it's durability......I might be wrong, only time will tell. But I was expecting a much heavier fabric, considering the weight of the griddle it carries. Apparently, these reviews can be edited at a later date. If this bag survises a couple road trips I'll keep ya posted on it's performance :-)"
4,"This is the Perfect Rocker, especiall if you have little ones.","I bought this in conjunction with the V-Rocker, and am very pleased with this product. I have had other video chairs but they all seem to be cheaply made, but this one is an actual piece of furniture. We have it in my living room and it puts me at the same level as my toddlers, who love to sit on my lap and read books in this chair. It is the most comfortable rocker I have ever owned.I often have to fight my kids to sit in there, as we all want to sit in ""Daddy's chair"".Great Product well worth the money. Shipping seemed outrageous until I felt how heavy it was."
2,Dog loved but...,My dog obviously loved her new bone but it lasted less than 5 min. I give her a bone when I leave to keep her occupied since she has separation anxiety. She finished this bone before I had a chance to get out the door. In my opinion this bone costs too much to last such a little amount of time
2,The Man Called Noon,"the video is made with very very poor quality,the sound is poor and the picture is blurred.."
3,Lacking,"I had this book lying around for a while. Then a friend asked me how to create a VB DLL that exports functions, not COM classes that can be reused by other VB clients. So, I gave him the book, thinking that something so obvious would be covered by this book. The topic does not seem to be covered."
4,good EP from an underappreciated band,"There's one reason to buy ""Focus on the Background,"" and it's the cover of Talking Heads' ""Naive Melody."" I love the original but this is a cool, organic version with acoustic guitars and the big pounding drums of Freda Love (Blake Babies, ex-Antenna). Totally worth having. MoL's first album ""Keep A Secret"" is a pretty good pop record and I recommend it (if you can find it- it's not available on amazon.com right now). They moved in a more midwestern, roots-y direction with their second album ""Come Clean"" (and in fact released two different versions, one with some tracks produced by the illustrious Brad Wood). ""Focus on the Background"" falls somewhere inbetween the two full-length albums, chronologically and stylistically. It was co-produced with Paul Mahern, who is also involved with the Lisa Germano/John Mellencamp Indiana scene. ""Wish You Well"" is another nice track, and it seems tailor-made for a wistful mix tape. Good stuff all the way through."
2,Good mindless reading,"At the beginning, I was confused. About halfway through, I started getting a little tired of the repetitive dialogue. About 3 chapters from the end, I decided that the circumstances in the story were pretty ridiculous. By the end of the book, I actually shook my head at the weird ending. But I did read the whole thing because I wondered what would happen next. So all in all, it was good mindless reading - just don't think too hard about the ramifications of everyone's actions. That's about par for all the Nance books I've tried to read."
4,Great book!,This is a great hijacking/ airplane suspense book with some interesting plot turns -- a medium short read of a day or so.
3,men's magazine maybe,"While the photos in this book are quaint, the info is very short of facts or wit. But then, who buys a book with a cover like this one for the articles? Really now..."
3,"Can't complain about the price, but too stubby","I purchased this tool to do some work on my bike, but unfortunately it is only suited to certain applications where the bolt needing service is not in a tight space. It was only 5 dollars with free shipping through PRIME so it was worth the price because maybe it will come in handy in a true ""emergency"", but i plan on buying a cheap set of hex keys from home depot to carry around in my bike bag."
