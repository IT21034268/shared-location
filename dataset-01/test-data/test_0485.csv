1,Don't buy anything from this group,"If you make a mistake and need to return the product, totally unused and in the same condition received, you must be given permission to do so. When speaking to the representative I was refused permission; I was told that I didn't know what I was speaking about and I should just go ahead and use the product, etc. I had to get Amazon Customer Service involved."
3,Space between fixed and moving cutter bars too big.,"The fixed space between the fixed and moving cutter bars is too big, consequently the trimmer does not shear small yew twigs cleanly. It strips the bark and leaves green bare twigs about two to three inches long. I have to wait until the bare twigs dry out, then go back and cut them off."
5,Federal Bureau of Idiots,"The book does a wonderful job of portraying just how poorly the FBI functions. 9-11 could have and should have been averted. The employees at the FBI (our paid servants) are a group of misfits. This book is one of many that honestly, without bias, shows us just how badly the organization runs. The blood of all the 9-11 victims is on their hands."
5,Great product,"I was expecting a cheep knock off, i had to look at the box to see if it was made by dodge. I couldnt tell the differance, and i am very picky. Fits and looks like oem.. Thank you , i saved a ton of money."
4,Fun read,"Just good, old-fashioned fun reading as we follow the Luna Kid's exploits and adventures growing up in New Mexico. Thanks, Ralph, for sharing some of your childhood memories with us."
4,"Black & Decker 16"" Hedge Trimmer","This trimmer is light weight and easy to handle, does a good job when I trim my bushes each year."
3,Be aware of ethernet cable issues.,"Be aware of ethernet cable issues. Even though the Cat5e spec is for cables up to 300 meters long, you may have issues with a much shorter cable, depending on factors such as the quality of the cable, the connections, bends in the cable, etc. I experienced data loss with a 90 foot cable.Otherwise, the adapter works fine with a shorter cable."
4,Great for Alt-Az mounting... Polar mounting less adequate,"The mount is adequate for mounting an ETX scope in altitude-azimith mode, but a beefier mount is needed if one wants to use an ETX125 in polar mode for imaging. An annoyance I have experienced with the tripod is that the clips on the mounting bolts tend to slip off, especially in polar mode. Each of the two mountng bolts has a clip, washer and spring that can be difficult to find in the dark if the clip slipping causes them to shoot in a random direction. This tripod as sold is difficult to polar align. I bought a third party bolt to replace the rod that holds the tilt-plate to make adjusting the angle of the tilt plate easier. There is no easy way to adjust the azimuth of the scope in polar mode; one has to rotate the whole tripod. For most users, this is a great mount, but those planning to take long exposure photographs/images with their scope will be frustrated with this mount."
4,solid interpretations of dylan's art,"If you like Dylan's gospel albums (gotta serve somebody, saved) then you will like this album of gospel singers singing with power a great writers gospel musings. If you are not necessarily into gospel (as I am not), this is a fine place to start an exploration from (as is Johnny Cash's the gospel collection). In this day and age of pop dribble, and other genre's that refer to themselves as 'music'???, it behooves you to experience a true songsmiths back catalog recreated by other artists. It doesn't get better than Dylan! Another excellent work is the recently released Byrds play Dylan..."
4,great anime ok dubbing,"I first discovered saint saiya in Mexico where it was showing the sanctuary saga nad at another time the posiedon/asgard sagas. and it was awesome. This has the first 30 episodes. The dubbing at first was mediocre at best, but it gets better as the show progresses. I was disappointed that they didn't have the the special features of the single disks which had character bios, and sections about the mythologies of the constilations."
1,this is ridiculous,Please do yourself a favor and just buy the import. I bought the entire series for $30. I can't believe it has taken them this long to just release the same 5 discs over and over. This is the 3rd printing of these same episodes unless you count Knights of Zodiac then it's actually the 4th. Gimme a break!!! I don't think any of us should buy and more saint seiya dvds until they release the entire series in one boxed set. How have they not figured out that what we want .. jeez. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!
2,Missing footage from a classic stooges short!,"I purchased this dvd for several of the classic shorts that were included on this set. After settling down to watch it I immediately noticed that during, "" Three Little Beers"" there was some missing footage.It was Curly dropping all the golf balls he had stolen, after Moe clunked him on the head. This I immediately noticed and was disapointed. I purchase dvds hoping to get a higher level of quality, but this I find inexcusable and ruins the expierience for me. Fans and collectors of this set will be very upset, wich number in the millions."
3,Broke after one year,"This is a neat CD player/AM-FM receiver. Slim, lightweight, decent sound. You can stand it up on a shelf and it is not awkward like Discmans. Battery/AC operation made it versatile. The hinge that closed in the CD opened sedately --- nice! Unfortunately, the machine is not ruggedly built. The CD player unit in my machine stopped working without warning after about one year of average use. I am still mystified. The radio still works well, though, although it was for the combination that I bought the unit."
1,You get what you pay for.,"The day after the radio/CD player arrived I tried it out. The radio worked fine but when I installed a CD, it would not play, despite multiple tries and different CD's. Called Emerson and they deemed that it was defective and should be sent back to the supplier (not Amazon) for replacement/refund. Did that the next day; have yet to receive my refund or notification of receipt.I won't buy anything like this from Amazon again, only books or things with no moving parts."
1,Didn't work,"I bought this product to play classical music during art class. I've given it plenty of time, but it has continued to be a frustrating problem, it works fitfully with the cord, poorly with batteries. When it does work, the sound has occasional static, but most often the CD won't play at all. The radio does not get good reception on weaker stations that other people's portable radios have no trouble with. It's a big disappointment. I had long ago gotten rid of the box it came in so wasn't sure how to return it. I probably won't buy this kind of product through Amazon again because it's difficult to return and get my money back."
3,Not bad for the money,"I've had this for about three weeks and it is still working after daily use. I only use it for a night-time sleepy time CD, which is good because the radio kinda sucks - hard to fine tune. Great for night use, though, because it doesn't have a big shiny-bright light to keep you awake, plus when the CD shuts off there is no big click sound. In fact, I've never even heard the thing turn off (this implies that I am still awake sometimes, which I am).All in all, I'm quite pleased. Maybe in a month or two it will stop working, and if it does? I'll let you know."
5,Excellent CD player,"I selected this CD player for it's trim, thin profile. All the others had ""bubble"" designs that took up too much surface space. I use this player for meditation CD's and find the hands-free and ear phone-free aspects to be perfect for falling asleep - plus you can set it up to play all night if you want. I recommended it to a friend and ended up ordering another one for her. She also loves it. I plan to take it with me when I visit relatives so I can have my nightime meditation music available. I have had it less than a month so I cannot rate its durability, but am hoping for the best."
3,Good Sound but Volume Control No Longer Works,"I purchased this radio the first week of December 2009 for an elderly relative. The sound quality is great and it is easy to use. However, two weeks ago I went to adjust the volume and couldn't. The volume control no longer works. I called Emerson's Customer Service who told me it sounds like a malfunction and they recommend I have it fixed or replaced. I could understand if the volume control was being constantly used but it wasn't. My family member leaves the radio on the same channel day in and day out and hardly touches the volume control so I am disappointed with the quality of the product. We still use it but I now need to find another replacement."
5,emerson portable cd/radio player,"I purchased this for my office, have one at home, it works great, as I do not want an ipod. I do not like having plugs in my ears. Quality of sound is good and CD player works well...good purchase..."
3,Good value for CD player with speaker.,"I was looking for a low-cost portable CD player with a speaker (so I could play music while babysitting my granddaughter), and this player fits the bill perfectly. The price is very low, I guess because CD is obsolete, and we can play portable music without earphones. Truth is, the sound is mono and isn't all that great. A better setup is to plug in a set of little speakers (like you use with a computer), but that requires a wall plug, and it would work on any portable CD player, in which case you probably wouldn't buy this one. But if you want something cheap to play CD's out loud, you can't beat the deal here."
2,You get what you pay for,"Radio is fine, CD player is not good......lots of skipping. I chose this based on good customer reviews but if I had it to do over I would have chosen a better quality product."
4,Radio/CD player gift,The radio/CD player was a gift for a 96 yr. old woman in a nursing home. She uses it to play music CD's and listen to radio sermons on Sunday. She says it works fine.
1,Disapointed,"I bought this to play CDs in our kitchen. After a few months of easy use, the cd player has broken. Sound was adequate for the price but not good. I would not buy again."
3,Didn't last long,It was okay but the cd player stopped working after about 6 months. I cleaned the cd player but that didn't help.
2,Not that portable,"Everything about this radio/cd player is ok, except that it uses 6 C batteries if you don't have it plugged in and they don't last very long. The C batteries are huge and expensive and this cd player goes through them very quickly. This means that it's not very useful as a portable music player. If you want to use this as a portable stereo or if you plan on giving it as a gift, you should stock up on batteries and/or make sure to include a supply of them with your gift."
1,Absolute Junk!,I tried to give it a zero rating but Amazon makes you at least choose a 1.It played one CD and quit. The volume can't be turned up enough to hear it unless it is in your lap. It makes an annoying noise when playing a CD. I should have know since we have had bad experiences in the past with Emerson. I was hoping it would work because of compact design. Save your money.
1,Don't be fooled. HORRIBLE quality over time,"OK, I confess. We were burned the first time and we bought another one.Why? Because it matched the decor of the bathroom we use it in (bathtime for kids).The first one completely died after very little use. The second one is also barely used and we have to hit the CD buttons over and over to get them work.The sound is fine, the size is great and the radio works ok for what it is...but the CD player is tempermental and we're just waiting for it to completely die again. It's already showing signs.BTW, we bought it both times at Kmart for about five bucks less both times."
2,High price for what you get.,"We purchased this last year for our outside deck, The reception is weak at best for both AM and FM. We live in Boston with many great radio stations that have strong reception but this radio can't pull them in. If you don't mind retuning every 5 minutes buy it. If not get something else, I believe this price reflects the name but in this case not the quality."
3,non-invasive but reliable emergency,"We have enjoyed this little radio CD player for over a year. It's been the chief entertainment and community connection when power went out, provided quiet background music for intimate dinners or picnics on the beach at sunset, and sits unobtrusively on a shelf waiting for those private studio CDs that we pick up from buskers and small clubs. Alas, it broke, probably from overuse. It's not quite sturdy enough to handle the abrupt cut-off when we answer the phone or the enthusiastic button hit of young music lovers. We would love to replace it with a high quality unit with similar functionality and tiny footprint, such as a slim wall-hung unit with dials on the front but closest thing so far is expensive intercom unit. Guess we'll have to corner the market on this little gem. Short wave or more powerful receiver would mean we could sail further and still enjoy the Vinyl Cafe."
1,Disappointing,"I ordered the radio/cd player because I wanted to take it on the ship with us. I paid 2-day postage to assure it would arrive in time, which it did. BUT the CD player didn't work, the radio antenna was broken off........very disappointing. I returned the product and got a refund, except for the postage, of course, which was more expensive than the product. BooHoo!"
1,poor quality,"we love to listen to music in the kitchen while cooking and working. i bought this after our sony quit working after a year. i was unhappy with the life of the sony, but very happy with the quality of sound and construction. this radio is poorly put together, has a plastic door that would break easily im sure. i wouldnt know, ive already sent it back. i tried 4 different cds and each one skipped. i had no problems with the volume as other reviewers, but the sound quality was poor in contrast with the sony. the search continues..."
3,"So far, so good!!!","Overall, I'd say this is a pretty good CD player. I was concerned though when I first plugged it in and the CD just spun around and then STOPPED!!! Only when I tried it a second time, I held my finger down a little longer on the play button and the CD kept spinning.This might have to do with the fact that this item is an older one--the label on the back says 'manufactured June 2006'. And if this is TRULY the case (and I don't see it wouldn't be--I mean, the label's not lying?), the cost of this item should come WAY down. Like maybe $17.99? (Maybe that's me) But I think an older 'new' product should have a better price point.Also, on my unit there were some superficial scratches on it. These things shouldn't and won't affect the playability of my unit. Only when you buy something 'NEW', you don't expect to see this kind of thing.Overall, I guess it's OK. It's just funny with electronics anyway. I mean, one day they'll work, and the next...we won't talk about that for now!!!"
1,Broke after six months,Other reviews warned that this CD player wouldn't last and they were right. It simply stopped playing after six months of extremely light use and for no apparent reason.
1,Limbaugh Lite. Ben Stein makes more money.,"Stuff everyone has heard before but with Stein's wry humor stirring the drink. Let's face it, people who read this type of book are most comfortable with the position of the book BEFORE they've read the first page. I found the book short on facts, inconvienient facts that might just cast a beam of doubt on the conclusions, and full of easy targets. Calling into the picture wackos either Left or Right to mock and dismiss is just plain lazy, which is my main issue here. Additionally the slant towards justification for ignoring climate change and pandering to that particular brand of ignorance is more than distasteful, it's borderline immoral. I saw about 40 copies of this book in a 99cent bin at a local dollar store a while back and the American Flag cover, mandatory for all books of the breed, made for a sadly pathetic display."
4,Good Study Aid ... Kinda,"The Law in a Flash series are AWESOME for most subjects. A great way to review, especially if you want to be efficient and get some studying in while waiting in line at a fast food restaurant, as a passenger in the car or wherever else your little heart desires.These cards definitely focus on COMMON LAW. If your professor has an itch for the Model Penal Code, these will not be as helpful for you. Still, they have some memorable catch phrases to help jog your memory come test day."
1,Weak,"This cd is weak, after reading these reviews i thought i would receive an amazing album. The beats on this album would be better placed on an NSync album. Someone said monster ballad Superman, well i dont know what ballads they have been listening to but its terrible. For all you people out there that know real rnb dont bother with this. If there is one good song on an album ill keep it and be happy that i have it however, this song doesnt have one."
5,Buy this CD!!!,"Shawn Desman is the next big thing! He mixes smooth ballads with uptempo hip hop sounds. The CD starts out quick with Bow, Never Change Me, Yoyo, Shook. It then begins to slow down with Spread My Wings, Couldn't Care Less, and Better Than Me, which showcase his vocal talent. He truly can do it all. At the tender age of 19, he's already a successful singer, songwriter, producer, dancer. He's definately holding it down for my hometown (Toronto)!!! If you're looking for something new and fresh to pick up, this is for you."
3,Wesley: A Heart Transformed Can Change the World,"I semi-enjoyed this film.If one views this movie more as a filmed play with some graphics, rather than a movie it will play off better. The movie was more of the story of Wesley's conversion to true faith in Christ, rather than a portrayal of his life and ministry (though such was lightly touched on following the probably less impactful shamed experience of John and Charles in Georgia, which seemed to be the greater part of focus in the film). As many Christian films the majority of the acting and the special effects were unimpressive. George Whitefield was a necesarry side-character, with whom I was unimpressed in the film, I was hoping they'd do a better job portraying him, as he was a powerful revivalist in English history and intregal in the assistance of the Methodist movement (specifically by aiding John and Charles in expanding their evangelistic view). The most likeable character in the film is Charles Wesley, John's younger brother."
1,not the coolest toy,if you are to buy a toy do not waste your [money] on this toy i do not think that this toy is coool if you are do buy something worth your money buy megaman
5,AWESOME,"As a huge Five Iron Frenzy fan, i was skeptical at first, at the idea of members playing music without the horn section. This CD proves to be something totally unique. The space-rock is unlike anything i've ever heard. It's truly the perfect compliment to all 8 official releases by Five Iron Frenzy. A must have."
2,Worst in the Series,"Of all the books in the series, this was the only one that I bought (rather than borrow), and it was the most disappointing. To me, it was a bit unrealistic and I don't think it sent the right message. Don't get me wrong, I like Moore's writing, but this one i didn't agree with- for instance, the way Payton tried to start preaching to that guy after his brother died (i don't want to ruin it for those who haven't read it.) I don't believe we should be preaching to people like that especially when they are upset. Don't ge me wrong, we should share our faith, but not like that- that get's on people's nerves. The best way to witness to people is by our actions- not preaching to them all the time. So in conclusion I say if you want to know what happens to Payton to end the series, read it. If you want to be entertained- this may not be the best buy."
3,Good ONE,"I think the book is really good if you don't have read any book about blogs.Just in this case, buy it.Otherwise, just read blogs, do not need any book.At least this is what I think.Best Regards,"
4,Great book,"I'm only about halfway though this book, but so far its been great. Its a quick and easy read. I'm already a blogger, but I'm still learning a lot about how companies are adding value by using blogging as part of their marketing strategy."
3,So far no leaks and looks beautiful,"I installed this differential cover last month and it still is holding the gear oil in with no leaks. It looks beautiful and was close to the weight of my original/oem cover.If I can install it (being a girl) anyone else can too.So I had to torque down the bottom bolts a couple of times due to a small leak.. HOWEVER, may be due to my pumpkin housing being rusted a bit.. I did try to rid the housing of rust and uneven ware but may not have been good enough.. The rear cover isn't leaking.. But was a different brand of cover...The rear diff (Amc 20) hasn't leaked yet."
3,"Focuses too much on ""getting revenge""","At first when I bought this book, I was very happy, but when I read I few chapters I was stunned. It was refreshing in some areas of the book, because I finally realized that what I was experiencing was normal. Considering the abuse I had to endure as a teen. Although, I thought too much time was wasted on ""getting revenge"" with the abuser. The authors seem to have much hate for men. Yes my father betrayed me, but I don't think that punishing him,is going to create a healthy life for me. Isn't getting revenge a form of acting out? Feeling anger towards him is still allowing him to effect my life. I need to find a way to have love for myself and others who care about me. The book was okay."
5,The premier work on the subject,"This book was quite literally thrown at me by a couples therapist who said, ""I think you need to read this."" I alrady had memories and this book helped me understand that there were others like me and the writing assignments helped give form to what I needed to express."
1,apalling and dangerous,"I have purchased hundreds of therapy books and this is the only one I have ever thrown out. It is utterly amateurish and has an agenda regarding human memory that is unscientific. It has done more harm than good, despite the good reviews.Zero stars."
5,Thank god for this book!,"I've tried therapy and I was never comfortable with it. I honestly believe this book saved my marriage and my life. It let me know that I'm not alone and that I can, and will be, okay. If you're struggling or just want a little more peace, give this book a try. It's hard to do some of the writing assignments, but it helped! I can sleep through the night now. And it makes sure you know that you can come back to the book any time you start to struggle again. Thanks to this book, I'm not longer a victim or simply a survivor, I am strong, I can, will, and do THRIVE!!!"
5,Touching,"I was recommended this book by a close friend, who was molested. It is a very honest book that forces you to deal with deep-seeded issues. It helped me see that any abuse is abuse, even if it only happened once as the experience changed my life forever. Reading the book will break your heart, it will make you cry, so make sure you read it in a private place. I will recommend this book to victims of abuse, even if it was not child molestation. When you are at the bottom, the only way is up, and this book helps you get there."
1,well-intentioned but potentially dangerous,"I would recommend approaching this book with grave reservations. My ex-therapist recommended it to me and it really, for lack of a better phrase, jacked my head. In particular, the authors' repeated insistence that, ""If you think something might have happened, it did happen,"" is an appallingly gross over-simplification of the way the human mind works. Please also note that neither of the authors have any training or certification in psychotherapy or counselling."
1,HOW IS IT AN EXTENSION CABLE??,"THE DESCRIPTION SAYS THAT THIS ITEM IS AN EXTENSION CABLE IMPLYING THAT IT WILL EXTEND THE REACH OF THE EXISTING CABLE.. BUT, THE CABLE RECIEVED HAS TWIN MALE ENDS MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO EXTEND THE EXISTING CABLE.. IT NEEDS TO HAVE A MALE AND FEMALE END.."
3,Dead,"I had this item for 2 1/2 years and only used it about 4 times a year and the last time I used it,it went dead.It would cost more to fix it than to buy a new one and this time I will try a different brand to see if it will last longer than 2 1/2 years."
1,In my opinion,"I listened to this CD once I have been telling myself I will try to listen to it again but I don't think its going to happen. This CD wasn't what I was looking for...I was looking for a CD with glorifying, worship, and praising God for the great, amazing, incredible, and awesome God that he truly is and this CD is NOT IT! It really depends on what you look for in a CD to determine if you should purchase this CD. The Clark Sisters: One Last Time is a good CD and puts you in the vibe to just think about what God has delivered you from and where you would be if he hadn't saved you from destruction that's the kind of music I recommend!"
1,Not worth it,"I purchased this unit based on price...it seemed like a good value.In the past I had always borrowed my friends professional gas trimmers but I kept my expectations in check as this unit is 1/10 the price. The feel and control is nice and I didn't have any problems with the cord falling off. However, the unit does not make clean cuts. It almost appears as if its tearing instead of cutting. You also have to go very sllooowwwwwwww or make several passes to even see progress. I will not use this unit again.I would not recommend this item."
2,Well . . .,"It certainly is different. I find Tietam Brown believable, only because I've done enough juvenile detention nursing to have run across characters like him. His father is another story. If you decide to listen to this, set aside any disbelief before the first disc goes in the player. If you have any distaste for crudity, don't put the first disc in the player. All in all, it moved quickly and happily is only 4 CDs long--longer would have been much to much. I don't regret listening to it, but I wouldn't listen a second time."
5,Couldn't Put It Down! Great Read!,"I got his book because I enjoyed ""Have a Nice Day"" and ""Foley is Good"", and I figured this would be pretty much the same. WRONG! I took it out of the box and decided to read just a couple pages to get the feel of the book, and finished it 4 hrs later. Foley does some great character development, and at some point, he makes you feel sorry for almost everybody in the story. The book manages to be funny, disturbing, sad, and hopeful all at the same time. I just hope other people don't pass on this book, thinking that it's just another ""wrasslin'"" book, because they will miss out on something wonderful.THANKS MICK!!"
3,Cheaper than Dance Lessons,"I started taking dance lessons several months ago and theCha-Cha was one of the dances being taught. I didn't want to wait to learn this dance so I decided I'd get the tape beforehand to get a head start.The video was very good in terms of teaching the basic steps and moves. Probably too much time was spent practicing each step but I also feel the same way about my dance instructor, some people in our class do need the constant repetition but I would prefer more moves being taught.Much cheaper than dance lessons, just wish they had an intermediate and advanced tape as well to learn additional moves.The Rumba tape was also good to learn by."
2,not as great as expected,I thought this would be a great litter container for the car. Very hard to reach because you cannot open the lid when it is behind you.
5,Great Product,"Received this case today. Quality construction, fast shipping. Fits my Paslode Powermaster f350 perfectly."
2,Tired and bored...,"...is the general vibe this record presents. Even my co-worker sitting next to me upon hearing the first few tracks verbalized my thoughts on this recording. Coincidence? I don't think so. It sounds more like Stanley recorded this out of obligation to his fans(and perhaps his record company?) rather than being genuinely inspired to make music. Nothing sticks out on this record in my opinion. Truth is this record fairly reeks of smooth jazzism and bedroom music, something I'm sure old school Stanley fans would find disdainful. No edge, no excitement, and no grit. And that's about it folks. But one word does come to mind when describing 1,2 to the Bass...conservative."
4,Tristes tropiques,"This is a scholarly, scientific book covering the most important aspects of the ecology and natural history of tropical bees. It's too dense and technical for the general reader, but I'm sure advanced students of entomology will find it a treasure-trove of information.Topics covered include biogeography and the age of bee groups, foraging and pollination, aggression during foraging, natural enemies, parasitic bees, ecology of Africanized honeybees in tropical America and tropical beekeeping. BTW, ""Africanized honeybee"" is the scientific euphemism for killer bee!The life of bees doesn't seem to be an easy one. If the life of entomologists is any easier, having to pay 78 dollars for a book like this, I cannot say. ;-)Still, I give this perhaps too technical book four stars. But, once again, this is not really for the general reader."
1,PORTER CABLE ROBOTOOLZ 3620-2K,I PURCHASED THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON IN JUNE OF 2004 THE FIRST ONE WAS DEFECTIVE IT VIBRATED QUITE A BIT I RETURNED FOR A REPLACEMENT THE SECOND ONE WAS BETTER BUT IT STILL HAD A VIBRATION I REVIEWED THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON AND THE REVIEW IS BASED ON A STABILA PRODUCT THAT I DIDN'T KNOW AT THE TIME PORTER CABLE USED TO BUY THIS ITEM FROM STABILA WITH THEIR NAME ON IT NOW IT IS MANUFACTURED IN CHINA I WOULD LOOK AT OTHER PRODUCTS I WAS DISAPOINTED WITH A PRODUCT WITH A PORTER CABLE NAME ON IT
2,Not as good as I hoped,"I really like some of the Bollywood stuff I've heard on my college radio station. I suppose what I've heard represents the best of various CDs. I bought this CD expecting a similar compilation but was disappointed. To my ears, the music on the first CD sounds like Indian versions of American movie music of the 1960's (not my cup of tea). The second CD is more contemporary, but I didn't discover any ""gems"" among the tracks. That's my opinion."
4,Works as advertized,"I'm not a professional gardener. My previous hedge trimmer was a Black and Decker that I purchased over 10 years ago and had always hated it. It only had a 3/8"" opening and would get ""stuck"" on large branches. There was a sale on this particular model so I decided to give it a shot. I'm very impressed with its performance! I cleared away thick branches and trimmed small hedges with ease. There may be better trimmers out there, but this one seems to do the job just fine."
2,A waste of Leslie Nielsen's talents,"The first part was promising, but the rest became very messy with a confusing plot and poor direction. The DVD release is not widescreen, for some unfathomable reason. A disappointment."
1,A Major Disappointment,"Travesty is right. This is one of those movies that tries so hard to be funny that it becomes terrible. It could have been so much better if the writers had done anything right.Leslie Nielsen stars in this, but he is hampered by both bad writing and an awful supporting cast. Both throw his comic timing off, which makes it impossible for him to showcase his talents. Everything in this is lame, from the plot to the acting to the special effects. Scenes that are supposed to be funny are really more stupid.It's sad that Leslie Nielsen has been pushed into doing garbage like this. He'd be much better served in a film that can better use his comic talents."
1,Very dissappointing,"Leslie Nielsen is usually a very funny comedic actor, but ""2001: A Space Travesty"" is exactly what its name says: a travesty of acting, writing and directing."
2,Leslie Nielsen's Worst Movie (At Least The Worst I've Seen Him In),"2001: A Space Travesty tries hard to capture the spirit of the Naked Gun series, many of the jokes that are trademark to Nielsen just fall flat in this film. Even the references to Star Wars and Star Trek do nothing for this film and just falls on deaf ears.Judging from the name and box art, you'd think that this would be a space adventure but it's not. The best part of the film is when they are in space and meeting aliens, but even that's still mediocre. When Nielsen returns to Earth, which is surprisingly fast, it goes downhill from there.This entire film just misses it's mark big time and just comes out horrible, and this is coming from a fan of Leslie Nielsen. Not worth buying, barely worth watching. Horrible film, but Leslie Nielsen fans can endure just to see him"
5,The ultimate WTF?? intellectual sci-fi book,"I picked up this book after hearing the author speak at A Clean Well Lighted Place For Books in San Francisco. The writing is clean and simple. He doesn't get too technical, or when he does, he explains these incredibly complicated ideas in simple language. That was the first thing I loved about the book: the concepts are complex, and the language isn't. As the story builds, you start to realize that all the little details along the way were clues to what was really going on-- you need only put enough pieces together to see what the puzzle becomes. And then, at the pivotal Eureka! moment when all is laid bare, he very suddenly and skillfully changes everything and leaves his main character to find his solutions in a heartbeat. The last third of the book can not be put down until the curtain falls. An excellent, excellent read, and a great start to what has easily become one of my favorite series."
5,Excellent story,It starts out a bit slow but it really picks up. Wonderful story. I can't wait for the third book.
4,Good - but more so as a prequel,"I picked up this book's sequel, Edenborn, and read that in one day before even looking for this book. At first I was a little lost but the story quickly introduced all of the characters well enough that I didn't need the prequel to get through it. Later I picked up Idlewild to see where it all came from. Where Idlewild really shines is as an introduction to the premise for much better stories. It's passable, and a fun read, but getting to Edenborn is so much more worth it. I have yet to read the third installment, Everfree, but if this trend continues it may well be the best of the lot. If I could give a recommendation, I would say to read this book only if you plan to read the sequel(s). All are short, fast, fun reads. So worst case scenario, if you don't like them you will have wasted a minimal amount of time. And if you DO like them, then they're well worth a little time."
4,There's a Chef in My Family,"I want to say that my daughter loves this book and so do I. I like the fact that it is big and gives step by step instructions. We have tried many of the recipes and she has been able to cook with just me looking over her shoulder. I plan on purchasing one for my nephew, because he is learning to cook and he likes Emeril's show."
4,Tiny Chef,I ordered this cookbook for my niece and she liked it. She wants to become a chef and she said the recipes are pretty easy.
2,Let's get real,"What's with all the five star reviews? Wow. I'm going with two stars because this book is made for kids and does a good job at attracting kids with all its funny pictures. But come on. These are total common sense recipes. If you are getting it for the pictures and for kids to laugh, fine. But for cooking (even for kids), no way. And it is a cookbook rather than just another kids? picture book, right? Seriously, the recipe for ?Eat a Pita Pizza? is ?buy a package of pitas, jarred spaghetti sauce and shredded cheese. Put pitas on tray, put sauce on pitas, put cheese on pitas, put tray in oven at 350% and cook until cheese bubbles?. Now, do you really want to spend hard earned money on that? The recipes are really very insulting. Bam!"
4,"A Good Read, I Recommend It","""It's Only the Enemy Screaming"" is a wonderfully written book, and I could barely put it down. The main character is very easy to relate to, and that adds to the novels credibility. Macenroe uses a good mix of long, philisophical passages, political messages, and very real narration to portray this story of a Boston resident. Though the book fails to progress quick enough sometimes, the great writing makes up for it. An overall good read"
3,OK but not haunted,"At least it was low cost. Kind of OK, but certainly not great or scary. I appeared to be a documentary, but after a while it became boring"
5,Another winner from Stabila!,"Wow, another cool new level from Stabila. These guys must have carpenters on staff because they always seem to come up with the greatest products for the professional carpenter. I have this level and it is fantastic. It is tight, even while extending it is not at all sloppy like the other extendable levels on the market. Like other Stabila levels it is extremely accurate. It is a little bit heavy, but the hand holes make it easy to handle. The plumb vial is always at eye level and there is a inch scale on both sides of the extended shaft. They did it again!"
5,"great tool, well built, time saver",I borrowed one of these from a friend to locate a top plate in a new wall I was putting up in the middle of a room. what a time saver. Kinda of expensive but worth it
1,Blows,This has to be the worst anime I have ever seen. The animation is good and that is all. The story blows and the voice acting is even worse.
4,Carioca Life,"Overall, I thought this was a great movie. There were a few moments that were trying too hard for laughs, however the story plot, the acting, and the scenery were all wonderful. I especially thought the scenery was exceptional! If not for the story, I think it is still worthwhile to check out this movie to see Rio at its best! However I do agree with one other reviewer that this movie does give the deceiving impression that everybody in Rio, particularly middle to upper-middle class people, live in apartments in prime locations with spectacular views of the ocean. There was not a trace of poverty or crime in this movie, but I think is appropriate being that this movie is supposed to be a light hearted romanic comedy instead of a ""favela"" movie. That's why the director's commentary is kind of a nice optional feature on the DVD version. The director, having himself grown up in Rio, clearly explains that he wanted to bring the best out in Rio. Happy movie going. Tchau everybody!"
1,Extremely Bad phone,"Phone Call quality - POORPhone size - UnweildyNot for someone who wants a cell phone as well as messaging tool.Unstable operating system, has crashed three times in 6 months and I have lost all phone numbers all three times. Would NOT recommend phone to a foe."
1,Tar pit piece of junk.,"Where to start? It's incredibly awkward, unreliable (service dips in and out at T-Mobile's convenience!), and overpriced. My email service just stops working for months on end every so often and ALL the settings are as they should be!It's also endorsed by a rapper, that should be your first sign!T-Mobile is truly the AOL of cell phone service. To them, you are just a whore for their stockholders. I actually had a customer service rep tell me that in the area of my house I would get poor service in my home, but not ouside. What the hell kind of thing is that to admit out loud?!? Hopefully they will fold as a company sooner than later, I doubt anybody would miss them! Do your life a favor and go with Verizon, even their slum phones work 99% of the time with no issues!"
1,"Buyer beware - This ""phone"" has all kinds of problems","My teen loves her Sidekick II and and all seemed well until ONE MONTH after we bought it the keyboard ripped, just above the ""W"" key. Apparently it happens all the time, and the people at T-Mobile know this. So, they decided to change their repair policy to make it very difficult to get it fixed. The customer has to go to a UPS Store with an order number and send the Sidekick in. It will take 10 days to return, 5 to 10 days to repair, and 10 days to get back to us. They don't give you a loaner Sidekick either. Very bad customer service, and low quality phone. Still waiting to get it back, I hope they fix it. Two more complaints - Phone doesn't ring if you are using any of the data services (IM, AIM, Internet). Battery all of a sudden doesn't work and you can't replace it, you have to send it in...see above."
2,Did you know?,"Sidekick is breakable, so be careful when you carry it. Average 3 to 5 break per user.The sync by connect USB to computer, T-Mobile will charge you $30 for one-time unlock that allow you sync to MS Outlook. No Mac available.The built-in camera is great, but you will pay 25 each time you send the higher resolution picture via e-mail.Bright side, it's $30 per month for unlimited DATA plan. That's all I can said."
2,Not a good phone,"The slowest internet i've ever seen before making it a complete joke. I don't like the Camera either as it's a poor Camera.No reason to buy this phone. If your thinking about joining T-Mobile just for this phone, don't."
2,Excellent Device Poor Service,I love this device.... when it works. I purchased it about 3 months ago and was in love with it for 2 months. Since T-Mobile has sent 2 software upates and the features have been unavailable while they work on the bugs... The first time only voice was available for about a week. This is the second and users have had problems for 3 days so far. Maybe test an update and fix the bugs before you submit the changes. But I cannot suggest this product untill service providers and danger get their stuff together. Read their message boards at www.hiptop.com first.
4,Poor recption and poor tech support,Love everything except... my reception is poor. People that I am talking to say they hear an echo when they talk. I am waiting for my third replacement. The tech support are people in India with a heavy accent and a bad attitute. They are not allowed to tell you that they are in India. They will say they are in North America.Ernie O
5,Giving The SideKick 2 Another Chance,"I recently brought my SK2 out of the box after a year and discovered I still love this device. This held me over until I was able to purchase the SK3 2 weeks ago.The service on this device has gotten better than my previous SK2 and my Color SideKick. However, the device no longer charges properly due to a broken USB port.To all of you who say this is not a good phone, you need to use the phone for awhile. If there are problems, get the device replaced instead of complaining about it."
4,Nice phone,"The phone is nice, I like it and does everything I need it to. It does take some getting used to, but after a while it lives up to the communications monster rep it has. Although web-page formating is awkward, it does a good job. I've had it for about 6 months and it's still working like a charm. The only drawback is the size, it's not big, but it ain't small either. Users need to be able to change the keyboard locale to whatever they want.So if you want a nice PDA, it's great. The camera sucks, but the rest of it is great for what you pay for (...)."
1,Lady bugs don't stay when released,"I have purchased this item twice now. Both times I followed the instructions and let the lady bugs go in my garden at night. Both times when I went out to my garden in the morning, they were mostly gone. After a few days all of them were gone. Would not buy again."
1,Orcon Ladybugs,"I would never order from this person again. The order was more than 10 days later than the estimated arrival date and when it arrived, more than half of the ladybugs were dead. Very overpriced for terrible service and dead bugs!"
3,1/2 Dead,"Our girl scout troop ordered these to release in a garden as to earn our Golden Honey Bee award. Thankfully they arrived the day we were scheduled to release. When I opened the box the ladybugs were in a thin plastic bag that had holes all over it (there was also a hole were the bag was sealed so some of our ladys escaped early). There was some wood stuffing and sponge material in the bag with the ladys. I am assuming this is nest material and a food source. There did not seem to be 1500 bugs but more like maybe 500. Half of the bugs were dead upon arrival. I'm not sure if it was due to the heat in shipment or what. Luckily my girls were not upset or traumatized by the dead bugs. They still had fun releasing them, just wished there were more of them to watch in their new home.Price comparision to a local garden center: worth the dead ones since it was still 30% cheaper than local prices."
2,1500...more like 500!,I get the container and at first glance knew there was no way this contained 1500 lady bugs. I actually split them into jars putting approx 40-60 per Jar. It took 11 jars. I'm not pleased with the false product information.
1,Dead on Arrival,"I ordered 2 sets of 1500 count ""Live"" Ladybugs. They came in a clear pint container with sawdust and dead. Waste of money"
1,"Not 1500 live lady bugs, not even close","At best there was 75 live lady bugs... on the package it says each will lay 20 eggs, so I guess 20 x 75 = 1500, but... last years I bought 500 live lady bugs from another company and I got 500+ live lady bugs. I was expecting 1500 live lady bugs, not promises of generations yet to come. Having Lady Bugs in the roses and vegetable gardens are great, but when you buy these... do not anticipate you will get more than 100. Buyer beware."
1,Ladybugs didn't stay,"Maybe it is because it is Arizona and we are dry...I watered my yard thoroughly prior to releasing the ladybugs. They were quite active that evening, but nothing come morning or all the next week. Wishful thinking that this would work. Well, my granddaughter and I had fun spreading them around :-)"
4,Good Company,I have purchased lady bugs from here and they are a good company that stuck by there word. I recieved a bad batch of lady bugs that were all dead and I sent them an email. They replied that same day and sent me double what I had ordered. Great Company !!!! they really came through. I will always order my lady bugs from them. :)
5,Insects hard at work,"Although it was very late in the season, many ladybugs arrived alive and I saw them hard at work on my tomatoes, Borage, potatoes, and other plants many days or weeks later."
2,dead bugs,"yep there will be alot of dead bugs when you get these lady bugs. THE LADYBUGS! WILL BE DEAD! I bought 4 bags and at least half of them were DEAD when they arrived a week later! The other half flew away when I opened the bag, as in away to never be seen again!"
1,Sent the wrong amount of ladybugs.,This order was for 1500 ladybugs. When I received the package there were approxametly 300 ladybugs as compared to the other order of 300 ladybugs I received. There is no way to contact the seller that I can find and I am certainly not going to return the live bugs. I am very disappointed.
4,Lady bugs,I invited the neighborhood kids to come and release these creatures into my rose bushes and they have a lot of fun. My Knock Out roses are flowering well.Will order again next year.
1,they were dead,"they were dead and dried up when they got to me . if there was some kind of instruction , I didnt get them with the order"
4,Disjointed but inventive,"I must say my recollection of this book is a little fuzzy but I do recall some very interesting concepts. Egan must have had some epiphanies and felt compelled to wend them all into a story about not so trivial matters such as the evolution of gender, politics, and of course technology. I remember that I read it in bursts around 1999 so it may have been my sporadic reading habits and not his writing that made me think it was ""disjointed.""***One particularly distinct memory of the book was where the main character replaces his damaged note taking device (aka a ""tablet"" today) with a new one and downloads his data wirelessly! When I read that I thought now that's cool and I want one. :)"
2,The kind of science fiction I'm tired of.,"This is one of those books that tells me how stupid & delusional I am & I'm sick of it. I've liked some of egan's stories in Asimov's, Axiomatic, & elsewhere, but I'll never buy another of his books again. I've liked atheist authors ,Asimov's my favorite author, but some are aware of a little thing called tact. I didn't give it a lower rating because the snide atheist school of sci-fi is quite popular."
3,Read the Originals !,"Very strong start in a familiar city of tomorrow changed by broadband communications and biotech. Interesting character development. Then it goes to a floating island and much time is spent describing its infrastructure and politics. Pretty convential techy sci-fi, minus much action. Many characters, characters lecture each other and posture.As far as Egan the ""idea man,"" well.....The scenario of the butchered man revived for questioning is Alfreds Bester's The Stars My Destination.The mob of New Agers besieging the cosmologists is Isaac Asimov's Nightfall.And the computer that triggers the end of the universe by calculating ultimate truth is Ray Bradberry's The Nine Million Name of God..... All of which were better than Distress"
4,Excellent for the professional,"Now that we all have laser printers and computers, we are offered 120 - 400 different fonts on even the most basic home computing set-ups. Many people are interested in knowing more about ""orthography"" (doing typography well). Bringhurst's book is thoroughly professional and quite readable. It's complete (it covers non-English characters in some depth) and encyclopedic, and in my judgment it is a standard of ""best practice.""However, this book is written at a level that would be appropriate for a serious graphic designer who is considering designing a new font. It's a bit beyond what a layman would need--or find interesting.Recommended, then, for professionals only."
2,A Disaster,"Although the graphics are pleasing to the eye it hardly compensates for the difficulty of the game. First, you are timed (not very much time for that matter)and the turn twisting streets are hard to navigate through. All in all i would recommend you do not buy this game, spend it on something else.BY: Chris"
1,Wreckless,Not as good as the GameCube or PlayStation2 versions. I have both consoles XBOX and GameCube but I dont recommend buying this game for any console. I bought this for XBOX thinking it was the same as the GameCube and PlayStation2 versions. The vehicles dont have weapons on the XBOX version unless you earn the tank. Plus there are not as many cars on the Xbox version and all three versions have lousy graphics anyway.
2,Not much fun,"This game was another disapointment for the XBox.The good:1) You can run into anything2) The cars are fastThe moderate:1) Storyline is dumb, and uninteresting2) Characters are ditzy, and totally uninteresting3) Some unique missionsThe bad:1) Graphics that look PS2, not XBox quality2) The game is boring after 30 minutes3) A totally indestructable vehicleRent it, DO NOT BUY THIS TITLE."
2,"Fabulous graphics, but horrible controls","Wreckless cooly shows off the graphic power of the Xbox. The rendering of a stylized Hong Kong looks just gorgeous. The framerate is also good, and there is a lot of action. But the controls are a big letdown and makes the action a moot point at times. For some reason I have a lot of trouble making simply left and right turns, and when I try to powerslide I more often than not slam into a wall -- mind you that I thought I was pretty good at playing Project Gotham. The cars also flop too easily, and you can get stuck occasionally due to what looks like a bug. Very frustrating. At best a rental title."
3,Frustrating - Infuriating - Beautiful!,"Let's face it - we all love a good-looking game. While some ""purists"" out there might claim that looks or graphics don't matter, we all know that that's not true. When we launch a game, like Wreckless, and take a look at the screen, we all want to run out and call our spouse, sibling or friend to check it out. And graphically speaking, this is a title worth checking out! The problem with the game is that it is extremely tough, in a way that becomes frustrating and infuriating. This is an arcade type game, which requires the player to repeat levels over and over again until the figure out the ""key"" to beating it. I, unfortunately, am not that patient.So, give the game two stars for how it looks, and one star for how it plays. That's three stars, which makes it better than average. The look on the non-gamers face when they see it is worth the price of admission."
1,Give Me a Break,You have got to be kidding me. What was the X box thinking. Wreckless has to be the worst game in history. Sure the graphics are okay but the driving [stinks]. This is no Grand Theft Auto 3 or Grand Truismo 3 Aspec. I played it for 5 minutes and was already sick of it. The Sounds [are bad] in this game and if I were you I would spend my money on a game like Halo or something else like this. Sorry being rude and all but you have to put some thought in the game. It's nothing like you see on T.V.
4,Works well!,"This polarizing filter definitely improves the look of my photos, especially on bright sunny days! It brings out a rich deep colour and eliminates most of the glare to give a wonderful picture. Here is a shot I took using the filter http://myworldmylens.aminus3.com/portfolio/5.html"
4,From the Heart,What a talented young couple. What a spiritual connection. I would definitely recommend this upbeat and powerful profession of love to anyone who wants to be filled with the spirit of the Lord.
5,Very Cute!,"We love it!!! Cute little story of a woman who keeps having more cats show up at her door to live with her. She names them all in alphabetical order, and then there is a surprise guest who wants to move in at the end. SO Cute!"
4,I had to get this game out of my house.,"I owned Gitaroo Man for well over a year, close to two years probably. I finally ended up selling it on here for $30. (Who knew it was worth so much?).Gitaroo Man is your standard (read: Japanese Weird) rhythm game, where you punch buttons and move the analog stick in accordance to the 'music'. Whether you have any sort of rhythm is really arbitary to your success in this game. Gitaroo Man really measures your ability to remember the button patterns, your reflexes, and your knowledge of where those buttons are on your PS2 controller.I had to get this game out of my house, though. I had been stuck for 6+ months on the 6th song, and I knew it was hopeless for me to try and finish it."
2,Terrible.,"I remember waiting months on end for the release of this album.The day it was released, I bought it. Took it home. Put it in my CD player, and it was horrible right from the start."
5,Inspiring,You just can't go wrong with Nita Leland. The Creative Artist is packed full of inspiration. Clear instructions and great photos.
3,its cool,"Well I bought one of these curiosly its not bad. It may not be the most educational toy on the block, but why do you care if it makesn you smart? I men its a fun summer toy not a freakin school projedt! Its a Toy!!"
1,acting lessons a must!,"I cant belive seymore cassel worked on this film! the budget (not very big) must have went to getting a name in the film.The plot is silly and the acting even worse Are we to belive all Arquettes can act! The other lead Roperto...I hope he has a day job, must be related to someone making the film. Cinda Williams as the sex pot!!!! check out the celluiteA better name STINKERS"
4,good ring,its a good sized ring. its a little small but is really nice. it fits perfectly and it looks exactly as advertised.
2,There are better and more informative books for the price.,"The book is full of touchy-feely feel good stuff, but realatively little useful information. That which is useful could have been written in about 20 pages, and would cost a whole lot less. Ironically, one of the best sources of information I have found on home business, ""Paul and Sarah Edwards"" (all of their books), was one of the ""featurettes"" in the book. If you like touchy-feely stuff and aren't worried about receiving your money's worth, then by all means, buy this book."
4,A very fun and funny game,"When I got this it was so funny, a guy runs and makes a touchdown and he throws the ball down but it sticks to his hand. Isn't that cheating, putting glue on your hands to catch the ball,hmmm? Well not in NFL Blitz it isn't. They beat the heck out of eachother. Like Randy Moss or someone make a touchdown and dances and yells out ""Whoooo I am the greatest whooo!"", then out of nowhere a guy comes a tackles him, the Randy or someone would go ""ooooh my ribs ah!"" The game is fun too, but when you lose or your just about to make a touchdown a guy from the other team jumps up and intercepts the ball you just wan't to curse at them but remember it's ONLY a VIDEOGAME. Even though I gave it a 4, this is a must have, especially for people who like football!"
5,MUST HAVE,This game is a must have it is so funny you can put in infinate turbo and faster running. when u return the ball you can zig zag all across the field and make a huge mob of defensive guys chasing you. It is awesome when you do a 2 man blitz with a friend with infinate turbo and faster running you can make soo many sacks it makes you want to cry with laughter. I recommend this game for all who like football.
2,George Washington's Cows,The book was a disappointment in that I was looking for information about GW not satire. This book was purchased to read to a preschool group so the satire was lost on them.
3,Very simple look....needs readjusting a lot,"I have many chimes, water fountain chimes etc. This fountain does chime, but it you must get the stem that goes over the water that comes up from the bottom ""just right"" for it to work properly. I used it for a few days, it tended to get ""off center"" maybe two to three times a day. I would notice it wasn't chiming and I had to center it again and again. It took alot of time to get it just right. It wasn't worth all the fuss. The light shines from the bottom up and does light up the light blue bowl but if you have it on a table and look at it ..it looks rather stoic and bare like it needs something else on it or around it to finish the desired look and sound. I wouldn't purchase unless you have the time to fiddle faddle around with it all day."
1,A Time to Heal: The Autobiography of Gerald R. Ford,Apparently a used book with some writing on the face page that had been scratched out and the spine was broken. I wish I would have had Barnes & Noble order the book. Because of this bad experience I probably will not be ordering books again.
4,Decent cable,"I'd call this a cable a good deal. Fabricated in China, it uses generic RG-174 type coax which is of course all polyethylene and will normally provide a loss of about 5 dB for 10 ft at 2.4 GHz. If you want significantly lower loss, consider a larger cable such as RG-58. Connectors are typical Chinese RP-SMAs with some unspecified gold plating that usually holds up reasonably well. The bulkhead receptacle includes the 5/16 nut and lockwasher. Strain reliefs have heatshrink applied at both ends."
3,A new GTA,this game is fun i like the movie and the game. i mean u have so much stuff to do u get to rob place or mug people u get crack or u spray walls. this game is better then that new mortal combat game. u can really never get bored because theres so much stuff to do. its worth 50 bucks o also instead in gta they would just pull a gun to ur face u get handcuffed and ur gang memember will free. its really fun
3,"Good to rent, but not buy. The game is pretty good, but not very deep.","The Warriors is a fun romp, but it wasn't as engaging as other Rockstar releases. The environment is small, and not varied enough, the things to do in the story mode are limited and get old quickly, and overall I finished the game in a rather short period of time.Good rental. Save the other $40 for something else."
3,A bit disappointed,"While I liked the deal I got on this piece to add to my collection from Barrons Catalog through Amazon, I was a bit disappointed that the piece I got was made in China and not in the UK like the rest of the Spode set that I have. I wonder if the more expensive piece through Amazon is made in the UK or is identical to the one I got? The vegetable bowl and cover look fine though, and I'm glad to have added it this year."
1,Think twice before buying this stroller!,"I bought this stroller for my son because it had the features I was looking for: compact, lightweight & easy to use. I brought it home and put it together with no problems. I tested it out in my living room before ever putting my son in it. Thank goodness for this because the back seat rest kept collapsing. All it took was a little amount of pressure from my two fingers and it would fall. Needless to say I returned it immediately. I now use the Graco LiteRide stroller and LOVE it! Babies R Us is now selling a model or you can find several models at WalMart.com. It's small, lightweight, has much better padding & a generous basket."
2,BEWARE!!! NOT for OLDER babies or toddlers!!!,"I just want to say, this stroler is so easy to assembly, but definitivelly IS NOT A STROLLER FOR OLDER KIDS. My 1 it's just 24 pounds, and the stroller was so hard to manuveur, also his legs were practically in the front wheels. The one hand fold it's tooooooo hard; I think it's maybe a 4 hand fold!!! Also the seat belts. I asked for a refund after the 1rst time I used it for a short mall trip. Then, I bought a Jeep Liberty Urban Terrain (not the one with air wheels). This one it's more expensive ($99) but worked great!!! Super easy to ride with one hand!! I went to Disney World and I just have to say this stroller saved my life!!To conclude, If you like this lightweight stroller (Babytrend) you can buy it only for a lightweight baby (maybe 9 months max.)."
1,Dont waste your money!,"I thought I was really going to like this stroller but it is a big NOPE! I have had it about 3 months and already thrown it away. What a waste of $[...]! I should have used that money towards a more expensive model. The wheels were impossible and kept getting stuck in a sideways position where the stoller would not go at all! The fabric gets stuck everytime you try to put the seat in the upright position. It never did collapse right when you went to put it away. Also watch out for the clips! I pinched my finger trying to close it and drew blood. Thank god it was not my son's finger. My son could not sit upright in this stoller, he kept sliding down. ( and he is 2 years old so he can sit up fine!) He always looked so uncomfortable in it!Dont buy this stroller unless you are looking for a big headache!!"
3,brad GANGSTA?,"ok so is scarface is supposed 2 be a gangsta?,my personal opinion is that he is seriously overated, sometimes his voice can be very annoying,anyway the album is ok and that is really about z ro and devin the dude do alrite, the obvious standout track is the one where he goes on about 50 cent being a snitch,also recognise is a fairly good track,why j prince wernt happy with the album(the fix)def jam gave scarface last time beats me cos that is a lot better than this,i guess he felt with scarface being hood n all he had to have scarface take it back to the streets and come up with a weakly produced album for him!"
2,scarface needs to back to def jam south,"scarface past couple albums were hot, but this was staight up weak. i cant beleive some of the wack beats, hooks, and lyrics i heard on this album. this is definately not worth buyin, maybe not even downloadin for free."
4,mr scarface is back,"yes, he has went back to rap-alot and got mike dean and n.o joe to but that g-rated music back into his album. the fix was good,but any true scarface fan knows that him and rapalot mix together real good. this album to me is like if you combine the diary and last of a dying breed together. i luv scarface cause always kept it real for us present and past street dwellers. the only knock on this album is on maybe two songs he uses some verses he has already kicked on other outside projects. true fans will notice, others won't-so thats okay. go get the album, trust me, thats my balls and my word....."
2,The Exploited Go Broken Hearted Love Songs,"Uh oh! Somebody must've broken up with their girlfriend. The title song and a couple others are ok -- but ""lost love"" songs?! Whatever happened to the asexual, political, screw-the-world Exploited that we all loved? I'll stick with Beat the Bastards, The Massacre, and Troops of Tomorrow."
1,not good at all,"don't get me wrong, i love the exploited. i don't really like punk music, or any music for that matter, but i love the exploited. sex and violence, barmy army, punks not dead, i believe in anarchy, dead cities, it is all terrific. there old stuff is the best. this album sounds nothing at all like the exploited i know. they are screaming and doing heavy metal guitars and it gets to the point where it doesn't matter how hard you try, you just can't like it. i mean, you can't even hear their british accents. what the f**k! i miss the old exploited and unfortunately the days of punks not dead, troops of tomorrow, red mohawks, and british accents are probably over. oh well, at least i have the old stuff. for a great exploited album, get the best of the exploited for a great price and TONS of their golden stuff. that is the one i have. it is the only cd i have and the only one i will ever have. OLD EXPLOITED KICKS A$$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,a great album!!!,"Buy this album. It's very metal, very punky, and very brutal record. I recommend this album all those guys who like punk/metal."
4,punk o rama,"If you like the sex pistols you will like the cover of holiday in the sun,this cd is good old punk with non stop guitars and running bass lines,the best songs are f*** the system and never sell out."
3,I would suggest going another route,"I use this phone for work. Initially I was quite disappointed that the call center I'm in didn't use Avaya since they're so reliable. After over one year of being employed here, I'm still disappointed that this call center doesn't use Avaya.The phones are durable, yet look cheap.All of these phones have a loud buzzer who's volume can only be turned down, not off. Even then, after the setting has been to the lowest volume possible, after 24 hours the buzzer immediately goes back up to loud and scares the **** out of you! Not cool.I have had to change out a few employees phones for different ones because suddenly their headsets weren't working with a specific phone. Once we switched out the phones their headsets were working find.I'm just really not happy with the phone. I would suggest going a different route."
2,"I think that was Ong-Bak....fast forwarding.....yeah, I think this is it.",I have been a fan of the original Ong-Bak for some time. I imported the original before a US release and find it to be one of my favorite martial arts movies period. I was very excited for this movie to come out even though Ong-Bak 2 was a major departure from the original. The fight scenes were great and entertaining but they definitely lacked the raw feel of the original. Some of the stuff done here cannot be faked and that's it what I loved about the original.The big downfall to me is that the cultural differences between Thai and the US are dramatic in this movie. I was so confused by things that were going on and did not understand how certain scenes related to the movie. I found myself fast forwarding to skip through long drawn out scenes. I can't really say that I would watch this movie all the way through again. I may show some people some of the fight scenes though.
1,This movie was disappointing...,"The movie starts where it leaves off at the end of Ong Bak 2. It felt like it was starting to be good, when the body healing process begins for Tony Jaa's character. The healing process continues... He's wrapped up like the guy on Kung fu Hustle, but for more than an hour of the movie. When he finally heals, the action isn't nearly as good as the other 2 Ong Bak movies. The villain he's waited to kill for his whole life is killed by some demon and it doesn't make sense. When he fights the demon it isn't that entertaining... This movie isn't a must see... It's not enough action... Save your money... Watch Ong Bak 2 again and imagine your own ending..."
1,Ong Bak 3 is not as good as Ong Bak 1 & 2,"I saw this rental since I was a fan of Tony Jaa, but priced at $9.99 you are not getting your money's worth if you are comparing the story telling and action scenes from the first two movies to the last. This movie seemed to have much more graphic violence to make up for the lack of story or action. I think Ong Bak 2 ended fine and part 3 never really needed to be made. This movie picks up with the protagonist being resurrected after being brutally killed and follows with his quest for revenge/retribution. Ong Bak 3 takes on a broader theme of good versus evil. The added mysticism aspect of the movie did not throw me off as so much as its execution in filming. Then again, perhaps I am being overly harsh since it's a Pre-Theatrical release."
3,A OK book.,"I think that this book just hit KA's deadline, because she didn't seem to put as much effort into this one as she has done in the past. I still reccomend that you read it, as I would all Animorphs books, but I think this one isn't her best work."
4,It was very exciting and full of suspense,It was a winner. There were parts that were way to cool. I sincerely enjoyed it.
5,Damages is a Beautiful Book.,"I had to tell, to all of you, how much I enjoyed reading Damages. To take a glimpse of the each character's life in this book is like learning consecutive valuable lessons that we can use any moment of our lives. This story is very unique, the author's voice is intriguing and original, but it brings back a lot of situations that we all have experienced. This book made me analyze and understand my family and my relationships with people better than any book before. I am dying to find out what happened next. I am hoping that the author will write the sequel to Damages soon. I thank Bazhe for reminding me of from where I came. This book is a must read for anyone. I recommend the new 2004 version ISBN 0595297145."
5,acceptance,"this book dealt with things i have confronted all my life: my sexuality, a distant father, a need to establish my own identity...and to heal. I could not but it down...i had to call a friend who read it so we could discuss it. james"
1,A fictional autobiography?,I thought I was ordering an autobiography which should be nonfiction. This book is nothing more than a gay romance novel. I do not understand all the rave reviews. How can anyone believe all of this actually happened to the author? It is beyond awful and I will trust the reviews on Amazon no longer. No stars. It wasn't worth free.
2,I didn't go into it seriously; I knew that going in.,This was an exercise and a lark to look at this book and try to see if I could take it seriously. But I didn't and wouldn't advise anyone doing so. Take your stress out on a little white doll? A bit over the top and not really informative at all. Other cultures have diverse beliefs and Voo Doo would not be one I'd consider seriously. Although an open mind is always a good idea.
1,Tisk Tisk,"If you wanted to do Black Magick I think you could be a little more creative than this, people! Get some books on real Voodoun or Black Magick (which isn't related) and stop being so gullable. PLEASE!!!!!!"
2,"Gag gift, but that's about all.","Someone gave this to me as a serious gift because they knew of my interest in the occult. If you have a friend or family member with similar interests, don't get this for them. It's hokey and a bit of an insult to serious practioners."
5,They Don't Make Them Better,"I have been reading ""The Literary Review"" for years--all essays, reviews, letters, bad sex prizes. Since every reviewer (almost every, although I don't remember the exception) writes with such lucidity, enthusiasm, and intelligence, you don't want to pass up a single article, no matter how remote your own interests stand in relation to its subject.Looking forward to my subscription (did you say you offered a lifetime subscription?). . .Laura Berke"
4,Excellent work,"This is a tremedous piece of music. All the songs stand out individually, yet the album remains cohesive. I'm guessing a lot of the songs are very personal to Dereck (especially 'Jane'). Big thumbs up."
5,A Wonderful Book,"This is the only book that my almost 5 yr old has begged me to keep reading. My grandmother read it to me as a child and made a photo copy book for my mother, which I have now. I would love a real copy. It should be re-published...it would sell very well and kids of this generation would benefit from it's wonderful tale."
4,windshield washer pump,This windshield washer pump that I received works just fine! The only reason I did not give this product a 5 star rating is because I had to install it myself.ACI 177115 Windshield Washer Pump
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"I love books with an Island setting, so when I heard about Trophy House, I had high expectations. I was sorely disappointed. The characters were superficial & highly underdeveloped, and this book did not do justice to the beauty of Cape Cod. I generally read a good book in one day, this realtively short novel took me 4 days as I found it EASY to put down and DIFFICULT to pick back up. If you'd like to read a truly great book this summer try: Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, by Lisa See! 5 stars & more!"
1,Irritating,"If I hadn't been stuck on a five hour flight I never would have finished this ....There was no reason for her political rantings and the plot was silly...so much for book reviews, reader reviews are always better..."
4,Great insight into the life of an addiction doc,"I am a big fan of Dr. Drew Pinsky, and I eagerly anticipated his book. It chronicles his life as a doctor who runs an addiction rehab clinic in LA, and gives many fascinating details about the people he treats, their backgrounds, the issues they face in getting clean. The focus, however, is a new twist on the addiction story...what does the doctor go through in dealing with these patients? Not only does he explain how patients are treated for this problem, and the rationals behind each step, he also goes into detail about the emotional toll it takes on the doctor. He sees firsthand the pain, both physical and mental, that his patients are suffering, he knows that many of them will never get better and will die from their addiction, and he wants nothing more than to deliver them from it...knowing all along that much of it is out of his control. It is generally a fascinating read."
4,Loveline,Love the book Love the ShowCan you ask Adam this?? If you are literaly a millionaireWhy do you suffer through California heat waves without central air??
5,Dr. Drew read this please,I wanted to tell you two words that need to be changed:beneficiarybenefactor
3,Happy,"Overall, it is a great cream and it does work. I dieted and exercised while using this cream so I can't say for sure the cream alone works, but combined with eating better and healthy and exercising 7-9 hours a week, it definitely helps! and it makes you skin smoother and it feels significantly tighter."
4,So Far So Good,"I've been using this product for about 2 weeks.. I've like it enough that i'm ordering another bottle. Nothing miraculous, but i have seen slight reduction in cellulite severity.. Also, because of the ingredients, im willing to give give it another go.. Caffeine has known properties to reduce the look of cellulite, Seaweed has been known to reduce water, Retinol helps aid in the production of collagen which helps skin look supple.. Hey for 16 Bucks, why not.."
5,A Painful Hit,"For most adults The Crocodile & The Dentist is likely to appear excruciatingly repetitive. This impression is not alleviated after 60 or 70 readings. In other words, it is a delight for 2 and 3 year olds, probably because of its repetitiveness. Youngsters will know by heart the story of the crocodile and dentist's mutual fear of one another long before they weary of hearing it read aloud."
4,Nice but not a match for us,"We bought this fan to use in out family room with low ceilings. We ordered the 44inch blades, however once we put the fan up ,the blades looked too short in portion to the large center unit. The installation was great and we were disappointed that it didn't work out for us. We returned it and amazon was great about the return, although we had to pay the shipping to return it."
4,Great fan,"This fan is fabulous. I purchased it in white. It is unobtrusive, quiet and hugs my fairly low ceiling. It provides very good air circulation. My only criticism is that the ceiling light is not very bright. Better as a fan than as ceiling light but j am still glad i purchased it."
1,Add another $50 to the price to replace the receiver,"We actually have 4 Minka fans in our home. Out of the four, two have needed new receivers just after the 1 year warranty ran out. For the 1st one, Minka was willing to send out a new receiver. Although it was a hassle to switch out and we were disappointed that it had to be replaced so soon, at least we were pleased that Minka stood behind their product. For the 2nd one, no such luck. Sorry, says Minka, you're past the 1 year mark. A new receiver is $50. Considering the fans themselves are about $250 each, that seems pretty steep for a part that obviously doesn't last. Plus we get to take the fan apart to hard wire the new receiver in. You decide. Personally, next time we buy a fan, we will look at other brands. A 50% failure rate for the receivers + a waste of our time is enough to send us elsewhere."
3,Install not so Easy,"For a home owner, this is best done by two people. My install, done alone, took several hours. When finally complete, the fan works very well and looks great! This fan was fastened to the junction box used for a light fixture. Installing the base plate, using screws that were too long cause a short in the junction box- corrected with shorter screws. Attaching the base plate was tedious due to the positioning of the plate- essentially working blind. Positioning and holding the fan unit was also slow- couldn't get both slotted screws to engage simultaneously; using one of the non-slotted holes and a pick held the unit in place temporarily to attach the other screws, but even the final screw was hard to engage. Some bad words, but got it done! Fortunately screwing in the light bulb and attaching the diffuser and fan blades was quick and easy! The remote functions very well. With two people, this would probably be a one- hour job."
1,DO NOT BUY MINKA FANS!!!!,"In addition to horrible customer service, the fans are poor quality. One of my fans was missing an internal blade bracket, causing the blade to go through the wall. The other stopped working within 1 year. Minka did not make good in either case. You would think they would be concerned that the blade could have killed someone. I know it is tempting to buy them because of their design, but DON'T!!!"
1,Minka is Most Noisy Fan on the Market,"Salesman said Minka it was expensive because it is a high quality silent fan. BALONEY! I had a licensed electrician install it, fan is so noisy it sounds like a helicopter is landing on my roof. Went back to Farrey's store in Miami and replaced it two times and all 3 Minka fans are noisy.Have a friend who bought 4 fans for her new home and she says all are quiet except for the Minka brand fan.I contacted Minka customer service and they are zero help."
5,"modern look, functions well","I love the way this fan looks - sleek and modern, but not so weird that it draws your attention away from the rest of the room. I've only had mine for about a week, but so far it operates well: the fan is silent and doesn't wiggle. a few things to consider: you have to use the remote control to change the fan speed and turn the light on/off. its a neat feature, but unnecessary in my book. and if you're prone to losing remote controls, beware! it does come with a little wall-mount though, which would reduce your chances of misplacing it. Also, FYI: the fan blades are plastic. they look just fine, and it doesn't bother me at all, i'm just pointing it out because they appear to be metal in the photographs."
1,Cute but useless,Great for a conversation piece. But we couldn't feel the air moving from it even a few feet away. A $250 disappointment. House recently ravaged by Sandy and we didn't even bother to take the fan out before walking away.
3,Ozzie & Harriet,I would like to have a collection of the series that was in chronological order- this skipped around a lot- from when the kids were little to the next one of them as young adults.
5,"Peace, Love and Lather","I bought this patchouli soap at a local supermarket and loved it the first time I tried it. My after-work shower is an important time to let the stresses of the day go, meditate in solitude and bring the curtain down on my day. The scent is lingering and pure, and produces wonderful lather in a bath pouf. Concentrating on the aromatherapy aspects of patchouli, it encourages positive energy and spiritual well-being. The soap itself leaves skin feeling very fresh, soft and clean. I never want to be without this product."
5,Be Careful!! Reading this book could change your life!,"If your are struggling with money-- read this book! If you are fighting with your spouse over money-- read this book! If you are clueless as to how to get out of your current finacial situation-- read this book! If you want to grow in your undersating of the meaning of your life-- read this book! If you want to keep drowning in debt, if you want to keep reaching for that better car, or bigger house-- then DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!"
5,Why Our Money Counts,"I teach a seminar at our church on the Biblical approach to managing one's finances, and I use this book as a starting point. My students love it (one said she needs to go back and ""marinade"" in each chapter. Another pointed out that the while the title is ""Your Money Counts"", what he got from the book is ""Y our Money Counts."") The bottom-line is that this book is an easy-read and makes it clear why God cares about our money matters, and it is equally clear how to apply those principles to succeed financially. I teach it once a year, and so far 90 students would vouch that what this book teaches works!"
5,EXCELLENT,"SUPER SHINNING HAIR, soft with a pleasant smell of coconut.I LOVE IT.I recommend it for people with dry hair."
4,Our Christmas tradition,"My 4 year-old got this last holiday season and loves it. The books are just the right size for her, and she loves seeing ""her"" books on the tree. The stories are simple, and hold up the usual Disney values of friendship and empathy for others, etc. I wish that there was a way to hold the books in a little more securely during the off-holiday season though; we are looking for the Tigger book now."
2,Not worth it,"Kim Stanley Robinson was talking with his muse:""Muse, I've got all these stupid ideas in my head like of people with faces where their right eyes should be and cats crawling out of a woman's loins and people with stupid little fruity plants growing out of their shoulders. These ideas are really distracting me from my work.""The Muse answered,""My advice is to write all these stupid ideas down and pretend you are writing a novel out of it. Tie all the unrelated parts together somehow. Use all your wonderful descriptive powers. That will get them out of your head so you can concentrate on writing something coherent.""KSR:""Good idea. I think I will call it A Short Sharp shock, because that is what I feel like giving myself when these ideas are stuck in my head.""Later...KSR: ""Whoops, I accidently emailed it to my publisher.""MUSE: ""I'm outta here."""
4,Unexpected and Intriguing,"This shorter work by Robinson was totally unexpected. Like all of the Robinson's writing it is more character driven than plot driven as are his other works I've read - The Mars series and Years of Salt and Rice, and his climate change trilogy. This one was more enigmatic, but very provocative. It is the story of an amnesiac on an improbable world that allows the author to explore, but not answer, themes such as the nature of beauty, memory, relationships, the essence of being, and the perils or rewards of social interactions. It is as strange a story as I have ever read, but oddly satisfying, despite its abrupt ending. Read it."
5,Great Show!,I didn't continue watching after season 2. It wasn't the same Ashley! He's is like the Charlie Sheen of Two and a Half Men. Put him back on the show!
2,Slides off my face,"I bought the untinted moisturizer, because I was looking for just a lightweight product that I could use on my face as sunscreen. I was disappointed. As soon as my face began to sweat at all, it became slippery and very wet. I have tried using less lotion, with the same effect. I followed the directions, saying to apply directly after cleansing. I'll try something else now."
5,Thought-provoking and persuasive,"Margaret Blair analyzes the two major theoretical approaches to corporate governance and then persuasively refutes the notion, central to both, that maximizing shareholder value is the only legitimate mission of a corporation. The key to her argument, that shareholders are not the only bearers of residual risk, is intuitively obvious in light of the changing nature of work in many sectors of American industry; however, I have never seen the point made with such analytical rigor."
1,Where's the playing?,Way too much talking about himself and way way too little playing. I bought one of his DVDs. Won't make that mistake again.
3,Apparently only SAT takers are supposed to read this book,"I'm not ""preparing"" to take the SAT so I felt odd reading a book in which I was not a target audience member. In other words, the author has sold himself short by marketing his book to a niche audience. Strange. Anyway, I purchased this book because I'm going back to high school to get my GED (I'm 38) but I am not preparing for college (hence my earlier reference to NOT taking the freaking SAT). And, to be honest, I was also tired of my 15 year old nephew using all these big words like 'piquant' and 'effusive' and 'schmaltzy' etc... So I told that stupid brat that I would be able to use stupid big words too. So thanks to this book I got my GED and I can now castigate my stupid nephew. So if you aren't taking the SAT don't feel upbraided by the stigma and get a copy of this book."
4,A little book with some deep reflections,"There are a number of books on the seven sayings of Jesus from the Cross; most of them are relatively short, and this one is not an exception to that generalization.This is, however, one of the more eloquent and thoughtful works on this subject. It is also a relatively recent work, published in 2004, and has a fresher, more modern perspective than some of the older books on the subject, such as those by Fulton Sheen and Arthur Pink.If you are familiar with other works by Hauerwas, this one has less humor by comparison (appropriately to the topic, I would say).Another excellent, longer book on the same subject is ""Death on a Friday Afternoon,"" by Richard John Neuhaus."
4,Great workout!!,This is a great total body strengthening workout. It especially works your upper body with all the fast-paced consecutive yoga moves. It's fun and challenging too!
4,A good workout,"I already own Denise's Yoga Buns and I love that DVD, but I was looking to mix up the routine a little bit. I had read good things about Body Burn so I thought I'd give it a go. I honestly like Yoga Buns better, but I also enjoyed Body Burn. I like how it's split into sections- a 20 minute section on burning and all different poses, 10 minutes on legs, 10 minutes on abs, and 10 minutes on relaxation stretches. Some of the poses in this DVD are the same as in Yoga Buns, but I feel like this DVD is more fast paced with less instruction, which is fine for me, but for a beginner it might be hard. I think Denise is more peppy in Yoga Buns. If you like Yoga and are looking to mix up your routine, I would recommend this DVD!"
3,TOO FAST,"I have always been a big fan of Denise Austin's exercise videos, having purchased them over the years for many years. So when I bought this one I was very excited to see how she was going to be with her yoga exercises. I have to say I was a little disappointed in that her instruction on each move is very fast, too fast for a yoga routine in my opinion, having taking yoga classes in the past. Because I have to look up at the TV screen, I miss some of the routine because she moves on too fast. If she would slow down for each move and give you more time, it would be perfect."
4,Okay...,This is only an okay book which I can download it in go.hrw.com. Why would I waste my money on this P.C.? (Piece of Crap)
5,Paul Oakenfold- A Lively Mind,"""A Lively Mind"" is a great mixture of trance, house, breaks, and hip-hop produced by legendary dj Paul Oakenfold. Though, everyone may not take in to this album thinking that it may sound like his earlier work. I would say that this is one of the best albums of the 2006, along with mixes from Tiesto, Sandra Collins, Hernan Cattaneo, and the ambient and inspirational BT album ""This Binary Universe."" I have been following Oakey since 1997, and have seen him evolve musically over the years. This album follows his previous artist release of ""Bunkka"" in 2002. To me, ""Bunkka"" was more expeiremental than the new release, but was and still is an inspirational album to listen to. ""A Lively Mind"" has a more focused track and is definately a worthy album to listen to at parties or before going out on Saturday nights. This album should definately not be overlooked or underestimated."
3,An album for trance music fans,"A Lively Mind is Oakenfold's most recent effort and has been criticized by many who don't realize where the true quality of his mixes are to be found. It is not in the idvidual tracks, but the overall product. As a party DJ, Paul Oakenfold has prefected the transition process from song to song, thus this is an album best listened to in its entirety instead of one that has 1 or 2 stand-out tracks. The facts are out there, Oakenfold is good at what he does: in an annual Top 100 DJ poll, Paul slipped into 9th place last year."
3,General Chillout,"The music on these CDs is as about as generic as the title would suggest, but doesn't quite live up to anything like, say, the Buddha-Bar series or anything else with ""Buddha"" in the title. This collection is very cheap for 5 CD's worth of music, and for good reason. There is lots and lots of filler. Most of the songs float by without making any sort of impression, making some nice background music for passive listening. However, if you are like me and look to music like this for a more spiritual experience, you will be disappointed. That is not to say that there aren't some good tracks; some of the standouts for me are Trade Winds on CD 1, Peace Prayer on CD 2, Sweet Dreams and Kafez on CD 3. This collection could have very easily been cut down to one CD. However, the low price means that you may get something you enjoy and weren't expecting at all."
3,Chillout - weirdout?,"I bought this because I had heard two songs on Pandora that I liked.Those are about my favorite songs on the five CDs.I don't regret buying this, but would have been dissappointed if paid full price - I think I paid around $12.00."
5,Heath's Handbook review,"THE expert on grammar, usage and puncuation.Index and appendicies make for quick reference.Everyone who writes should have one of these on their shelf."
2,"Not the greatest software, but better than others","Easy to use for planning layouts but it is a bit buggy. There are several known bugs and the publisher has yet to address them with any kind of update.For simple layouts, this program is fairly intuitive, but for more complex items, there is quite a bit of a learning curve."
2,A big step back for Jackie Chan,"After regaining some of the ground he lost in Hollywood with his last couple of Hong Kong films, Jackie Chan takes a big step backwards with the overlong Rob-B-Hood, a downmarket three bad men and a baby romp that offers limp gay jokes, comic relief mental illness, family bonding and child endangerment for all the family. There is one fairly good action sequence at the halfway point as well as a neat stunt that sees him jumping down a building via the air conditioning units, but you definitely get the feeling that Chan's no longer pushing himself but is just doing what he knows he can still do while Yuen Biao is mostly wasted in a nothing bit part. He's made worse, but that's hardly a recommendation.Dragon Dynasty's 2-disc set offers the theatrical version with audio commentary. There's also a variety of interviews and featurettes, but the film is such heavy going you quite possibly won't want to spend any longer on it once you've seen it."
3,Maybelline Lash Discovery,"Great concept, but very small and flimsy brush. The vendor delivered on time at a reasonable price. After using the product for a few months now as it is time to change mascara's; I will not order this particular style again."
2,Disappointed,"I was hoping to get something that would serve as a foundation plus the added benefit of a sun screen. I was very disappointed in this product because I still had to put foundation over it because the coverage was terrible. I use Neutrogena foundation and love it, but this is not a good substitute for it by any means."
3,showdown legends of wrestling is crazy!!!!,when i got this game i found so many glitches in it.but the gameplay is awsome they have a large variety of wrestlers and they have good mathces. my biggest complain was they dont have there original entrance musics.they only have about 10 moves per wrestler and no voice overs.the commentary is weak and boring.but its still a good game for all those wrestling fans pick this up
2,Only if you love the 80s,"This game was made strictly for the 80's wrestling. I got to admit I'm one, but this game just doesn't do it for me. The controls are not good. When you press a button and two seconds later, they do the move, it's not really good. I do like the Classic Matches mode where you control a certain wrestler at pivotal parts of the match and I also like the fact that there are so many wrestlers to choose from. Other than that, there's not really much to this game. If you got SmackDown: HCTP or Def Jam Vendetta, you're better off playing thoses."
5,Cheese Lovers Snacks,"I've been eating these since I was old enough to remember. My grandma always had them around her house. One of my earliest memories are of eating these tasty cheese crackers. Wise *used* to sell them off the web site, but they stopped selling to the public and now are only offered in the eastern states, thru grocers, not in Texas where I live, so they are a little hard to find in the middle or western states.As a subsitute, when I start to *jones*, I usually can find ""Old London Waffle Snacks"", which are essentially the same thing. My guess WISE makes them for Old London, but I don't know for sure, but you could fool me as for the taste, style of cracker, and looks...I'm sure it's the same thing."
5,Family Band,"This is one of my favorite movies. The players are fantastic. I love, love this movie! I have bought one for home & travel."
1,Not the best Disney movie ever made but....,"I'm a big fan of Disney movies, and sappy-ness doesn't bother me, but this was off the scales corny. Not much story, too much dancing around. Kind of chilidish for grownups and hard for kids to understand some of it, as it's mostly about politics, so it kind of gets lost in the middle. Buddy Ebsen, though, gives his usual stellar performance, and Kurt Russel and Goldie Hawn appear in the movie together and met on the set for the 1st time!"
5,Disney at it's best,I had been looking for this movie for a very long time. To be able to get a brand new movie for the price that it was was an extra perk.
5,Great Purchase!,This flag was as described and i was very happy with this purchase. It arrived earlier than i expected which was great! Overall a fast and easy transaction!
4,Eye-opening!,"The book was truly eye-opening for me! Having spent more than enough time with management consultants and the ""programs of the week,"" misguided Six Sigma projects, etc., I am very cautious about ""new"" programs. The simple, clear, transformational philosophy of the book was amazing to me. While the book does not outline the steps to take for making a Lean transformation, it should be required reading, before any venture into Lean management. Without an understanding of the philosophy behind Lean, many people mistakenly try to use it as a ""tool"" to cut costs, which will fail miserably. Lean - the new paradigm."
1,Walk Away from This Pedometer,The first one received did not function. I ordered a new one--also not functional. I cancelled the order.
1,"""The Lazarus Phenomenon"" hogwash","My curiosity impelled me to buy this DVD, but I had to return the item as defective and could not comment on its substance. A few months later, however, I watched the same video a friend of mine had received as a gift, and I was not impressed. As I see it, the film puts false ideas of afterlife ""reward and punishment"" in people's heads, has no scientific basis whatsoever and feeds on the gullibility of superstitious people. I would not recommend this video to anyone."
4,Great Workout,"This is a great workout program for those who are already fit and is looking to refine your shape. It's definitely not a program for beginners who's never worked out before. It's a good alternative to the book when you first start the program because it's not as intense as the book in that the number of reps are fewer and there are modifications to some of the exercises to make them easier. However, you must also follow the diet regiment in the book in order to see those quick results he promises."
2,Completely readable if you blame yourself for creating your OCD,"The Author is hopelessly addicted to the ""its your problem"" school of medical science. While I agree that I am the only one who can take control of my OCD , the authors reliance on constantly reiterating that you wont be in control if you ""don't apply yourself"" is less helpful than some of the explanations of the 4 step process in the book itself.The return to t he difficluties experienced by his private patients is quite simply boring, repetitive, and a monumental pain in the arse.Just read the section on the 4 step process, ignore the authors self aggrandizement, and practice the technique."
4,Brain Lock Free Yourself From Obsessive-Compulsive Behavior,I like the book. It is very good and helps me understand why some of us have obsessive compulsive disorders. I am not finished reading it. I really enjoy the book and have my mother Helen to thank for asking the psychiatric nurse what book she recommends for my autistic daughter and son.
5,Understand Your Brain Better,It helps the reader understand the brain functions related to OCD and how to deal with it.
4,Brain Lock: Free Yourself from Obsessive-Compulsive Behavior,"Got the book quickly; however, it wasn't quite in good as condition as indicated. I wrote and was told that I would receive part of my money back. Yet I never received it."
5,Thank God!,Seriously Thank god for this man. OCD is not to be taken lightly it can be a hellish prison in our minds. While reading this book not only did I begin to understand what was going on but it gave me a logical explanation. I've lived my whole life not having a map to peace. This is it! Thank you! Thank you sooooooooo much Mr. SchwartZ.
5,Excellent Resource for those w/ O-CD or work with those w/ O-CD,This is a quick easy read with one of the most exquisite strategies for dealing with obsessive/compulsive behaviors. It offers an elegant and yet simplistic approach that anyone can employ effectively. It is also a good resource for individuals with other similar obsessive or compulsive types of issues. I recommend this to therapists and patients equally.
4,More Power to Console,"This playstation system is good, it met my expectation. A great price deal. No problems with it since purchased. Thanks for caring for your customers."
2,Buyer Beware!!,"Tho this is a good-sized eye ice pack and may do the job on an infrequent basis, don't waste your $$. In the description, it stated it was cloth on one side. It is NOT! it is only filtered paper. For someone who would use this item several times a week, this will not last long at all and will start leaking quickly, especially if used with children. I am a nurse and have used many types of ice packs and speak from experience. I am disappointed and angry that I wasted time and money on this item. This is FALSE advertisement and they need to changed the description of their item. Buyer Beware!"
2,Thoroughly mediocre,"I have a two hour commute each day and I'm trying to utilize that time in some positive fashion. I'm studying for the GRE and was looking for something I could listen to that would contribute to this goal/project. This was a waste of money, since I knew 98% of the words. Also, a few words I thought were not very well described, and the sentances were contrived. The way they use two words with the same root in a sentance seems to be a sure fire way in my book to help someone confuse the two words' meaning. On the plus side, buying this CD set has now made me see the futility of this method of studying for the GRE, and saved me from investing in a more expensive CD set. If like me, you're studying for the GRE, my advice to you is to set aside time to read scholarly journals or essay collections, dictionary in hand."
3,Not for the uncoordinated,"When I bought this DVD, I had read a couple of reviews that said it was an easy to learn video and not confusing like her aerobic dance. I like her Pilates video, so I thought I would give this one a shot for some cardio exercise. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT for those who are uncoordinated. She never lets you know what she is doing ahead of time ,and then she does it quickly and doesn't show you how to do it. She also strings together whole routines of these moves and doesn't give any forewaring. I will not be using this video anymore; I'm going back to my Leslie Sansone walking videos! Kudos to the coordinated out there, but for those who are not so coordinated, stay away from this video."
1,"Never broke a sweat, never saw results","I am not a beginner but not advanced either. I'm somewhere in the middle and I work out between 5-6 days a week. I bought this because I thought it would be good since it had so much variety. I was very dissapointed. I dread doing this video and never sweat! I do not even feel like I'm doing anything! Debbie Siebers Slim in 6 ""Cardio Express"" is way better and only 30 minutes! Dont buy the whole set just that 1 is everything you need to see results. I would suggest this over any Denise Austin DVDS."
3,Good if you don't feel like a vigorous workout,"This is not very challenging, but good for those days when you don't have much energy but don't want to miss a workout."
5,Excellant!,"I love this workout video! I own 16 Denise Austin workout video's now and I love them all. They never get old because I rotate them daily. The cardio blast segments are great and I can really feel it the next day, which tells me this it's working."
3,Depends what you're looking for...,"This isn't a bad workout, really, but there are some things you should be aware of when considering whether or not to buy it. The biggest problem for me was all of the jumping around. It would be fine in a gym, but I live in an upstairs apartment and just can't make that much of a ruckus. So if you have the space and can take the high-impact, no problem. However, if you have bad knees or live upstairs, this workout is almost certainly not for you.My other problem with this dvd was that the workouts were so diverse in nature, I just couldn't get into a rhythm with them. It would be wonderful for someone limited on time who just wants to do a section here and there when they can squeeze it in - it would make for great variety. However, if you're looking to do a longer workout in one segment, I found it very difficult to ""switch gears"" from one workout to the next.This COULD be a good workout depending on your needs. For me, it ended up on ebay."
4,Better than I thought and eh,"Denise has been around for ages and so when I was looking for cardio dvd's for my collection I went ahead and added this one. I switch out my dvd's so I don't get bored and my body doesn't get used to the workouts.The dvd's has soem variety for the different dance styles which is nice. I agree with another viewer that the cueing is totally off. It took a couple times of using the dvd to know where I was going when. The moves are easy and the pace a bit slower than I would have imagined. You really have to put yourself into the workout to get what you need from it. I liked Denises attitude in the dvd. She is toned down but still perky. I need perky sometimes, especially in the morning when I'm try to get the bootie moving. I was somewhat unimpressed with the studio setup and the backup being out of synch. It seems to be a lower budget set, but it gets the job done."
4,Romance in a historically accurate Singapore of the 30 & 40s,"This classic romance a la ""Romeo and Juliet"" is set inthe Singapore of the 1940s. A Chinese and a British arenot an acceptable couple even if they have shared theirchildhood. The backdrop is the most interesting portionof the novel. It is well researched and revealing of thehistory and culture of Singapore."
1,Laughable Stereotypical Schlock,"Besides the fact that it undermines its own claims to cross-cultural understanding (in the marriage of the main character with the [of course] beautiful Chinese daughter of [what else?] a local tycoon) by turning pretty much the whole Malayan revolution into the attempted rape of his 'beautiful white' sister by 'ugly yellow-brown' Chinese Commies--and by seeing to it that the Dexter heritage goes into the hands of a purely British son, moreover--this oversized pile of schlock is so badly written that it should be read only for laugh-out-loud comedy."
1,Not a winner,"This Camera was a Christmas gift for my daughter, she was so excited... The Camera took awful pictures, The lighting was either dark or to light, the pictures where all blurred, not to mention they where all unfocused. We couldn't even figure out if it did take a picture.. This one got tossed in the trash.."
1,Book,This book goes in a different direction than I was trying to go with my kids. It certainly does not take moral issues into account. Not the book I would recommend sharing with your kids.
3,"Good settings, good actors, good idea, ho hum script","In this movie, it seems the director tries to go back to the ""darkness"" the earlier movies had and not the lighter, funnier side of Freddy as seen in Nightmare 3 and 4. Alice returns (different actress, same character, i hate that!)and is now pregnant, Freddy is using her unborn babies dreams to get to Alice's new friends. First, the movie is too short and the ending is dumb, the script and dialogue wasn't all the great either. Plus, what doesnt make sense is, if Alice is still in the same school from the 4th one, then why are all her ""new"" friends clueless about strange deaths amoung their classmates and a ""Boogyman"" town legend? I mean, only last year did all of Alice's old friends get butchered, and where were these new friends? Either they're very forgetful or the school is very very big. Anyways, not the best Nightmare movie."
3,Not as good as their others,"Jon S. and Lane S. are the best children (adult?) authors/illustrators out there. As with their other books, this one has great pictures, and a great premise, BUT the story is not tight, and seems to be more about the pictures this time and less about the story. Again, great illustrations, but I actually left this book at the bookstore as the story didn't capture me."
1,It Does't Work,"You need to order an a/c adaptor for an additional $15.00. Without the adaptor, the display, call waiting and the speaker phone are useless."
5,great!!!,i love this book it has helped me to understand the books in the bible more and understand the reading in the bible it is a great book.
3,Best for academics,"I think I""m the wrong audience for this title. It sounded soooo interesting, but when I could barely make it through the first 30 pages. This book is definitely written for the academic. It reminded of a Doctoral thesis."
1,Massive omissions,"What the heck ? This book omits MOST of the commands of csh/tcsh.I later realized that I could have found this from the otherreviews, but I fundamentally DON'T understand the purpose of abook that leaves MOST of the details about csh/tcsh OUT of thebook. What is this, csh/tcsh for ignorant people who wish toremain so ? Grrrr !"
3,A True Fan Speaketh,"Any one who has actually followed Nickatina since he began his unique career can plainly see that ""Conversation With a Devil"" is obviously a sellout cd. Yes my friends, Dre Dogg has commercialized. I would rank this cd above his worst album, ""These are the Tales"", but not much higher. First of all, 2 of his songs are from previous albums, and his tracks have a flavor not at all consistent or characteristic of a Nickatina cd. This newest cd was quite upsetting. Only half of the songs are actually good, and only a few of those songs( ""Fly like a bird"", ""Train with no love"", and ""Dice of life"") attempt to recapture the unique flavor Nickatina at one time effortlessly maintained. IF YOU ARE A NUBEE TO DRE DOG, YOU WILL LOVE THIS CD. IF YOU ARE A TRUE FAN YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED, BUT WON'T REGRET OWNING IT."
2,NOT HIS BEST WORK,"This cd was a big letdown for me b/c im a HUGE dre dog fan and i was kind of disappointed that the 2 best songs on the cd are from previous albums. I found that to be a sign of a lack of creativity and originality on Andre's part. Has a few decent tracks but nuthing thats gonna make u wanna throw this cd in more often then not. Could have been much better, and overall it was a big let down compared to previous albums."
3,Classic Masters,"Arrested Development was a good hip hop group in the middle 90's. They were about Peace and Freedom, and spoke their minds. On this disc you get the best of Arrested Development (In my opinion) Their biggest tracks start off the disc, then get worse as it goes on. The CD is digitally remastered. Arrested Development has never sounded better. I give it three stars because it's an average CD. It's the best of Arrested Development, which can only pull off an average grade.My top 5 tracks:Mr. WendalEase my mindTennesseePeople EverydayRevolution"
1,Terrible video quality,The video quality of this cable was appauling. Sent the cable straight back to Amazon even though with the shipping I will probably have little or no refund left.Cheap cable that does not work. I would not recommend buying this product
4,Once Again- OOE rocks!,"This CD is full of good songs- something you would expect from Out Of Eden! However, I must say that they are not as great as their previous songs- somethings lacking, at least to me. Still, anyone who likes the trio's voices can rest assured get his or hers moneys worth in buying this CD!"
5,Fantawesomagnifexcellent!!,"This Is Your Life is a fantastic cd! It has awesome beats, magnificent lyrics, and it has an excellent pitch! On a scale from 1 to 5, I would give it a 10. This is a cd that you need to run out and buy!"
4,Catalyst,"After reading ""Speak"" I really wanted to read anything else by her. She hasn't really written much, but she did write ""Catalyst"". It's about a girl named Kate. She pratically LIVES just to get into ONE college. When she's rejected her whole life, her whole plan just kind of crumbles. Kate is a runner and she uses running to escape her troubles. Everyone seems to have something they do to get rid of stress or just to forget something, anything. For me it's writing or painting. For Kate, it's running. So whenever something wrong happened, she'd take a long run. A lot of problems rise in Kate's life and the book is basically how she deals with all of it. This is a very good book, but I did like ""Speak"" better."
4,Good if you have nothing else to read but...,"Catalyst is the first book that I read by Anderson. It took me a while to get into it. Since the main character, Kate Malone, is really into chemistry the book is filled with it. The author even breaks down what is in Kate's soap and lists the compounds.Catalyst is about a senior in high school who is obsessed about getting into MIT. It is the only school that she applied to. Through more than half of the book Kate is talking about college and how she has to get into MIT since that is where her mother attended college. Her world is thrown upside down when Teri, the school outcast, and her younger brother Mikey move in. There house catches fire and Kate's father the local minister takes them in. One accident after another leads these two girls into the beginning of a friendship.If you like Anderson's previous books then you should check this one out."
2,I was disappointed,"The writing style is very good and gripping. However, I was disapointed by the end of the book. I felt too much hadn't been resolved -- I even turned the page expecting to see more or an epilog or something. I felt that the main character's story wasn't completed and that the lack of completion wasn't adequately resolved (you can have stories that don't quite end but reverberate)."
3,"Kate Malone--Annoying, Arrogant Geek","I listened to this book on tape (read by Samantha Mathis) and found the main character to be very unsympathetic. The biggest annoyance for me was the frequent overly dramatic comparisons between chemistry and the events happening in Kate's life. It almost felt like the character was mildly psychotic--""gravity ceased to exist,"" ""the stars elongated around me as I went into warp drive,"" etc. She was also pretty egotistical--she couldn't seem to accept that MIT had turned her down. I guess I just couldn't relate to her. It was disappointing because I really enjoyed ""Speak"" by the same author and read by Mandy Siegfried. In ""Catalyst,"" Kate has a brief meeting with the main characater, Melinda, from that book. Both books take place in the same community and high school. Catalyst is not completely without merit, but Speak is a much better book."
4,"Real life problems, real life teens","As always, this author's writing is very strong, and she does a great job of seeing inside the lives and minds of teens. This story has a lot of depth to it and, when the character lets go of her own obsession in order to start helping another person, it's quite believable. I think most teens will enjoy this book and the message it sends."
3,"A good read, but...","As several other reviewers have mentioned, 'Catalyst' does not compare to 'Speak'. To put it simply, Kate, our heroine here, is not a character it's easy to sympathise with, or even identify. At first she seems intriguing and promising (the Good Kate and Bad Kate idea) but after a while this wears off, and you become frustrated with her. I was disgusted with what she put up with from Teri, the class bully and 'weird kid', and despite the fact that we're supposed to develop sympathy for Teri as well by the end of the novel, I couldn't stand her. These are not terribly likeable characters.Having said that, I did read the book twice within the space of a month, so it's not all bad. Many 'serious student'/'geek' types will be able to relate to the pressure Kate is under, and the storyline is fairly interesting. Read with caution, I suppose."
3,As advertised.,"I shave everyday with this and I do like it., The heads wear out too soon and will start to scrap skin to point of bleeding; very annoying. But I got used to being smooth so I keep buying new ones when they start to bite me."
4,I like it,"When I decided to go 'bare' my husband about flipped his lid! I used a razor in the shower for the first week and wound up with horrible bumps. I did a little research and found this shaver. I was skeptical but bought it anyway. I really like it. I use it every 2-3 days at least. Very smooth, no bumps. I have used it with and without the baby powder; I have to say it works better with. The one I bought requires C batteries so I'm going to get one of these rechargeable ones."
5,"Variety, Effectiveness, Versatility","I'm not a Kathy Smith fan at all. I think her older workouts are just annoying and she always looked too ""top-heavy"". I exercise every day and have hundreds of DVDs, because I'm always on the lookout for the next great workout to a point of addiction. So when I saw this one, it looked appealing enough that I bought it. I'm so glad I did. I love it! The variety is great and the timing of each workout perfect to add on to a cardio or strength session. Kathy looks so much better at this age than when she was younger, well proportioned, very inspiring. She is also very calming and pleasant on this DVD. I feel really good after doing one of these ab workouts."
1,Let 'em use your digital camera!,"We bought this camera for our daughter for Christmas so she could learn how to use a digital camera. Bad mistake. The pictures turned out just awful. She used it once or twice, now it is another dust catcher on the desk."
2,Is this supposed to be a parody?,"I would give Jance my usual 4 or 5 stars except for one really jolting item. It threw the whole character out of context and made no sense to me. I can understand that the police would be largely Republican. But how can an OPEN-MINDED, LIBERATED, FEMALE law officer possibly agree with anything Rush Limbaugh has to say??? I could no longer relate to this character in any sensible way. It made me wonder if Jance was attempting a parody."
4,BostitchTrigger Valve Kit,"Excellent quality, simple to install, and worked perfectly. One negative - it seems a little pricey for what you get."
2,Not Song Versions I'm Used To,"Put in the CD and the most popular songs - Ballad of Jane, Electric Gypsy, etc. - are not the versions I've heard on the radio. Hugely dissapointing. Stay away."
4,Nice looking ..looks good when lighted....hanging wire is not elegant,Bought this lamp to replace my existing lamp in the Kitchen center table. The lamp is modern looking but pain to hang due to class parts and the cable (hanging) is not elegant.
1,a waste,All of the matches were a complete waste of time. and the main event hell in a cell was a joke. cant even call it a match.
1,Two storylines for one,"I read Jinxed, cute story, but Seduced wasn't what I expected, which was a follow up cute story. Lots of cliches and alot of back and forth between cities and characters. The second storyline, which I felt didn't belong in womens contemporary romance, went into too much detail about the homosexual couple, Rudy and JP. FYI, no euphemisms used here. Too many events happened that were described in brief, fun things such as the haunted B&B were just miracuously solved in a paragraph with no warning."
2,Worked OK for about 2 days....,Did a decent job for about two days then the handle broke. Not well made.
4,J. Alfred Prufrock Phillips,"This book is thinner -- in subject matter, in prose, and in narrative substance -- than Debt to Pleasure, but it is engaging and funny nonetheless. I carried it with me to jury duty and caught myself laughing aloud several times. In a real sense, Mr Phillips is less a novel than a compendium of set pieces, witty observations, character sketches and jokes. There is, for example, an exchange between Mr Phillips and a publisher of pornography that seems straight out of Monty Python. Though his main themes are sex and death from the perspective of middle age, Lanchester maintains a light touch."
5,"A brilliant, wonderful, beautiful film. Jane Campion at her best!","""Bright Star"" tells of the love between the poet John Keats and Fanny Brawne. It is a beautiful love story, which brings tears to the eyes. Keats died when he was 25, having gone to Rome in the hopes that a warmer winter might cure his illness, which turned out to be consumption, or tuberculosis. Keats and Fanny were betrothed at the time of his death.Both Abbie Cornish and Ben Whishaw are terrific in the lead roles. Perfect in fact. For those who believe in love, this is a film to watch and savor."
4,Good performances Lovely Story,"John Keats is one of my favorite poets. Nobody, but nobody (!) can write a torrid love letter like Keats!This movie was very well acted, well directed, there was definate chemistry between the two leading actors. I give it 4 stars because I really thought there could have been more. Maybe that is wishful thinking since Keats died at such a young age. I just thought that there could have been more character development in the supporting roles such as Mr. Brown, and Fannie's mother. Still, it was a very very good movie. Good enough that I bought my own copy."
2,Darkly Depressing,"This movie is very well done. The clothing and sets are wonderful. The acting is great. The problem is that that story line is dark and depressing. I don't like the character of John Keats. He was so self-absorbed and boring. His work partner is horrible. It's very slow and even though it's supposed to take place in a 3-year time period, it jumps around so much that it's hard to know when things are taking place during that 3-year span. I watched the entire movie but came away feeling like I'd wasted my time. Just not my cup of tea."
2,"Really Boring, even for people who like costume dramas","I love BBC miniseries and movie adaptations of classic literature. I don't expect them all to be wonderful. But Bright Star was soo boring. I was constantly checking my watch, it just seemed like i'd been in the theater for ages. It's hard to pinpoint what tips the balance toward a good movie. The acting and the settings/costumes seemed fine, but somehow it does not add up to an entertaining movie."
1,"too much angst, little content",I generally like historical romances for their wonderful dialog and intricate relationships. Bright Star however had neither of these attributes and quite frankly left me up to my ears in angst with very little noteworthy dialog from the main characters. The gaggle of foppish young men who deemed themselves writers of poetry were portrayed at best as wastrels who sat in judgement of each other.When the film finally reached it's end I felt nothing for the the people involved except relief that I didn't need to watch them anymore. I should have rented this movie first before buying it.
2,Silly,"Campion specializes in updating historical dramas to make them more ""relevant"" to our more enlightened tastes (see the sophomoric opening of her ""Portrait of a Lady""). No bodices are ripped here; but the bosom-heaving of her anachronistic hero and unconvincingly feminist heroine succeed once again in reducing the past to the politically correct imaginings of a director who clearly thinks history needs a good ideological scrubbing in order to be palatable to contemporary audiences. The results are distractingly silly."
4,AB Blast,These are quick abdominal exercises that work. Nice variety & perfect for a faster workout that still leaves you feeling like you've accomplished something.
5,Gateway,The book arrived very quickly and in excellent order. It is very informative to any one wishing to learn more about the Jewish faith or Jewish Race. It will help you to understand their ways and customs and make you appreciate their lifestyle more. It has helped myself as an American Jew to better understand why I am the way I am at times. Very informative reading and joy.
5,One of the best and most beautiful Cha Cha songs ever!,"If you dance ballroom you probably already know this song. Even though it's around 8 years old now, ""Place in my Heart"" is truly a timeless masterpiece. It's also one of the most difficult songs to find now in 2009. My CD shipped from Austria. I'm so happy I found a copy here on Amazon!"
2,Poor editing & bland content,"Numerous spelling mistakes (ie: potato for tomato!) and party ideas that have already been explored in other books make this one to pass on. For better insight, color photos, and fresh ideas, try Colin Cowie's Effortless Elegance or Nicole Aloni's Secrets from a Caterer's Kitchen."
2,Okay though the first part is not Pilates,"The first ""Cardio"" portion is sort of dance routine. Not pilates, which I feel is misleading as it was not mentioned in the product description. The second half is pilates but they are short segments. I did not want a dance routine with this DVD and I feel kind of ripped off. I am really glad that I did not pay full retail price."
5,I like this one for lighter days...,"At first I thought this DVD would be too ""easy"" for me. I was surprised at how much I felt the muscle fatique the next day.It seems innocent enough..starting out with knee bends then waving the arms side to side to engage the obliques...it gets harder from there.The ""dance"" part is a series of leg lifts, plies, lunges, gravevines with leg lifts, and always arm movements to go with them. I did sweat a bit--not a lot, but I did get pretty warm. (Say a 6 1/2 out 10)The mat work was perfect for me. I liked the leg and ab section especially. I felt it the next day.I only do this DVD every few weeks, but I am enjoying it more each time I do it ;-)"
2,Fair not as good as her Fat Burning program,"The aerobic section was not as good as her older ones, Fat Burning. The pilates demos' I found difficult to follow since she moved around to the staff to model moves. It is best when she demos."
1,Great idea that needs a lot of improvement,"This little paci is a great idea! It is in need of improvement, though.It is great for: babies 12 months and older, small quantities of medicine, and for occasional useThe medicine holder only holds about 2 mL and is difficult to shut once the liquid is in the holder/syringe partThe nipple is way too large for the age group that would get the most benefit from it- (IMO) 0-6mosIt cannot be machine washed (I tried) or sterilized as it will warp the syringeThe nipple is made of a relatively hard plastic when compared to the soft silicone usually used in pacisI plan to try the Munchkin Medicator next. I hope it works :)"
1,Mess!,Great idea! I was excited to be able to use this but when i pushed the plunger it went squirting in babys eyes:(
5,great product!!,"my baby doesnt take a pacifier, and we have a really hard time giving him medicine,especially that we have to give him twice a day....i stick it into his mouth and push the plunger and before he even realizes what happened, the medicine is down! He doesnt even cry when we give it to him...great product would recommend it to anyone!"
2,hard to open and close,"This medicine dispenser itself is a great idea. My daughter has no issues with sucking down the medicine with this pacifier.. However, what is up with it being so hard to open and close?? They need to sort this flaw out. The last thing I want to be dealing with is a screaming child in one arm, and wresting with a medicine dispenser open close function with the other hand."
4,Atkins substitute,"Since Atkin's has changed their formula for their drinks Slim Fast taste just as good. And since Atkin's has scaled down their marketing and its difficult to find their drinks at the same retails stores that used to carry them, at least I can find Slim Fast. Not my first choice, but I'm glat they are there to fill the void."
4,Great Product,The product for weight loss or control is great with this so far -taking it slow i have loast 30 pds in a year. Also it helps keep my diabetes type 2 in check amazing well.
1,Curdled!,"I am so disappointed. I ordered a box of slim fast from Amazon and the can have curdled milk inside. I know that it is summer and that it is hot outside, but there has to be some kind of cooling system for products like these! I am sooooo disappointed, Amazon."
4,Best of the Low Carb Drinks - Highly Recommended,"Being a Type 2 diabetic and somewhat overweight, I have tried almost every low carb bar and diet shake that I could find. The Slim-Fast Low-Carb Vanilla Cream shakes are very good and are my favorite of the lot. I do like the chocholate Slim-Fast flavors better, but these are nice for variety. I have lost over 70lbs by cutting my carbs and starting a workout program (which has also helped my blood sugar levels).These shakes do fill me up for a long time and taste good enough that my kids ask for them for breakfast. We also like theAtkins Ready To Drink Shake, Milk Chocolate Delight, 11-Ounce Aseptic Containers (Pack of 12), but the Slim-Fast is a bit more filling.Highly Recommended!CFH"
3,Does not absorb as well as other Thirstystone coasters,"I don't know why, but this particular set of Thirstystone coasters does not absorb liquids as well as other Thirstystone coasters. I wonder if the paint in the pattern has something to do with it. Also, these coasters look reddish-pink all over compared with the soft hues displayed in the Amazon photo. I'm somewhat disappointed with these coasters and do not recommend this particular version."
1,Not worth reading,Poorly written and pretentious. Not a new idea in here.My college level students are more thoughtful.
5,VERY GOOD BOOKS,"These books, this one and Part 2, are great for anyone who wishes to learn Circuit Analysis. Both books are straight and to the point in explaining theory. Ample amounts of examples and problems test one's understanding of this material. The integration of MATLAB use into the subject is well done. Anyone should be pleased at using these books as either a main textbook or as a self-study supplement."
2,Not impressed,"I tried this since I was looking for something to smooth my skin (ie the name of the product)..... it shot, and missed.....I moisturized fairly ok..... but it left my skin tacky tacky tacky....plus the little beads in the lotion were unnerving. If I want something to TRULY exfoliate, I want it in my body wash.... not my lotion.The smell was horrid. I couldn't stand it, and it radiates off of you LONG after you slather this on. I ended up throwing out my whole bottle after only using it twice I think. I'll stick with Vaseline."
2,"read in bookstore, but not impressed, LP Turkey better","Evaluated this in bookstore, but the LP Turkey had a bigger section on Istanbul and seemed better to buy overall. LP Istanbul didn't attract me with its layout, when compared to DK Istanbul. I could get a much better ""big picture"" using DK. Tom is an authority on travel to Turkey, and I think his website does a much better job at showcasing his expertise than this book does--it's more dynamic, updated, has discussion forums."
1,"Too broad, too unfocused","In the glut of noir books out there, there seems to be a race to include the most films under the Film Noir masthead. This book provides an impressive number of films but come on! There are westerns, horror films, adventure films and simple dramas. WAY too inclusive for any kind of true film fan. (and still oddly missing a few marginal noirs) Also, the author has a strange obsession with what TV shows the actors from films have also been in. In nearly every review he mentions some TV show that so-and-so also appeared in. That information is included while he leaves out such important elements to the noir style as who the cinematographer or composers are! A huge oversight. Plus the reviews are often plot spoilers. For how expensive this book is I was highly disappointed. I'd stay with Spencer Selby's 'Dark City' While you could argue that it needs an update to include some more films, it is a far better thumbnail guide to the noir catalog."
2,Very disappointed!!,"I purchased this video to show my wife the spectacular views of Arkansas. This does have some very pretty scenes but they spend too much time on close-ups. I was hoping for some type of narration or comments on where the scenes were located in Arkansas. It just starts off with a header of the Ozarks. Well the Ozarks makes up almost the upper third of Arkansas. You have no idea which park your at so if you would like to travel there to see the scenes first hand you can't. If you need scenic views to show on a big screen during a party, this video would suit your needs. If you would like a video that educates people about the beautiful scenery of Arkansas' various parks, this video falls very short."
1,disappointed,I think the title of this book should be renamed as INTRODUCTION TO ASP TECHNOLOGY or INTRODUCTION TO MICROSOFT PRODUCTS.
1,Another Microsoft way of marketing Internet Explorer,"This book should be called ""How to create sites that will only work in Internet Explorer"". It teaches more on how to ""take advantage"" of the MSIE features such as ActiveX and VBScript than it does ASP.If you seriously want to learn ASP, and make the pages you create available for everyone you should definitely buy another book.However, if you are interested in delivering your pages only to those that use Internet Explorer, and not really interested in learning ASP i most definitely recommend this book."
1,Scenery; YES---Story; NO!,"This is possibly the longest, most boring movie I've ever seen. It does not get any better after the LONG opening shots. The scenery is gorgeous, but I rent movies to be entertained! Neither Matt, nor Ben nor Casey (Ben-Casey, who chose these names? What were they thinking?) can save this one."
1,Pass this one by,Other then the time lapse photography of the sky and desert.This film is a big bore.
1,One star snooze-a-thon.,Casey Affleck character's shirt was fatefully symbolic: this was a one star snooze-a-thon. 10 minutes of material stretched into 1:45.
4,A life time lapse,"This is about, just about every frame being, a work of art of two humans, in every variant perspective, powering around to the point of death (and death), in three days. A super condensed version of what we all face. Like a cool time lapse of two lives. Seeing, first hand, a life journey, in 103 minutes. We're all dying, right now. But it's gorgeous as we pass through."
1,Pluck out your own eyeballs first.,"This movie is absolutely wrong. I can't figure out if these talented guys did this as a joke or not. You know the type.. artsy fartsy people staring and some blob of crap on canvas and trying to be oh so much smarter than the world and finding the meaning of life in the blob. If they did it as a spoof of these boring people then bravo, awesome job. Next time though, let us in on the joke ahead of time. I would have rather spent the time with my family. This movie is easily the worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen some serious trash."
5,Good long life,Have played many games with these balls and they are still very responsive. Very pleased with this product and would buy again.
5,Good buy,Got them in under 4 days and my Dad was happy with them. I just thinks it's sad how much paper amazon uses for a small box.
1,"Warning: Disgraceful version, avoid at all costs!!! (NO STARS)","I picked up this version because it is a cheaper ""reissued, remastered"" version of Little Richard's masterpiece, but this record is hands down the worst transition onto C.D. I have ever heard in my entire life. I wouldn't be surprised if the amateurs at Hallmark music & entertainment picked a cassette of 'Here's Little Richard' at a garage sale, set the equalizer to high across the board, and used a computer microphone to record it onto C.D. Do yourself a favor, stay far away from this horrendous version and buy the double album on Gold C.D. (well worth the extra cost) or rip this album from the internet as a torrent; either way you won't be disappointed."
5,Here's Little Richard - Like Hearing Him For 1st Time!,"These are the cleanest sounding renditions of this material I've ever heard. I've never heard the instrumental backings come through so clearly. The info booklet with the set is excellent; complete discographical material is especially welcome. My only complaint is I could've used more detailed directions on how to view the bonus videos on the disc. By trial-and-error, I was able to download them using Quicktime; I had no luck with Windows Media Player. I recommend this set even if you already have most of the songs on other discs(as I do)."
2,tired...,"the first 50 pages were OK but downhill from there.these are the tired rantings of a liberal who now realizes the failings of that mindset... but now it's too late. the author seems to think that picking grapes is some sort of noble undertaking and that manual labor is superior to his real job--- college professor.now that the predictable chickens have come home to roost (mexican invasion, more welfare for illegal immigrants and overloaded hospitals full of thirld-worlders, he is SHOCKED!!SHOCKED!! that there is gambling going on at Ricks in Casablanca...mediocre bathroom reading at best."
1,"Well written, racist and xenophobic book.","Ok, the author is an scholar, and after teaching and working in a university environment, he knows how to structure his sentences and chapters to communicate his message.Unfortunately, his message is of racism, hate and xenophobia, no matter how careful he is to try to hide this facts, they appear often in his writting. He mentions that he likes Mexicans, but only if they turn again his own identity and culture, to ""assimilate"" to the American Way of Life.He even ""agrees"" that shaming people of their own culture was the ""right way to do things"". I have not read them, but I'm sure that this book looks like the ones where scientific ""proved"" that blacks were inferior, with ""rigorous scientific facts""."
1,Absorbs smells/flavor...,"I have a set of these pans and they absorb the smells and flavor of anything previously baked/cooked in them. No matter how much you scrub, the next time you use them, keep in mind, you'll be tasting part of what was baked in them previously. They're also very flimsy, so good luck removing them from a hot oven. Nothing against the seller, just a bad product."
1,Whats is the ingredient,"Iron, by itself, is not an ingredient. There are no pieces of iron in any bottle. The vast majority of the ""iron"" supplements contain one of these as the actual iron ingredient : ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate, ferrous bisglycinate, ferrous glycinate, iron amino acid chelates, carbonyl iron, heme-iron polypeptide, polysaccharide-iron complex or Iron protein succinylate.Which one is in this product???? Which is in any iron supplement? I have never seen any supplement group (iron) have less information as to what is inside. All of the iron supplements are devoid of what it is actually giving you as the iron in your diet."

2,Not what I expected ...,Taunton has a very good reputation for their publications so I thought this would be a great book to help me with several projects I will be undertaking. It was a disappointment. There was nothing innovative or unique about the ideas presented. The cabinet styles were either very basic or so custom they did not provide realistic options. If you are looking for innovative or creative ideas for a realistic cabinet project ... look elsewhere.
4,A book with many great ideas,I own a collection of home design books and it is not easy to find a book with many great design ideas. This book is filled with great ideas and some beautiful designs. I find myself grabbing this book repeatedly. If you're thinking of creating some built ins this is a great book to own. I wish it was twice as thick!
2,Warm and itchy...,"This costume is absolutely adorable, except it is made of fabric that is itchy on the inside, and it is not lined. On very cold Halloween nights it may be OK, as it is really thick, and you'd have to put it on with an extra layer of clothing on underneath since it's so itchy. My son looked just precious, but didn't last longer than 10 minutes in it, and he fussed and cried the whole time (he's NOT a fussy child in general). Oh well..."
3,"Great book, poor layout","This is a wonderful book, everyone should read the content, but the presentation of the book from this publisher is very poor. The publication is unnecessarily large. Huge blank margins surround each page. This is nothing more than a poor photo copy of the original book plastered onto a large page format. The copies of the original are sometimes missing characters around the edges and are not always clear. If you have the option choose a different publisher but do read the book in some format. It will change your life for the better."
1,Professional Surveyor's Manual,"I found this book left me wanting for more ""manual"" type reference information. It is quite specific to Ohio area standards for highway and boundary surveys. It is not a good reference for beginners needing a ""daily use"" surveying manual."
5,Free Flying Soul - one you need for your collection!,"Of all the Choir's cd's (and I have all of the ones still in print and a couple of the ones that aren't), this one has the most ""perfect"" songs on it. ""The Warbler"" is a haunting song that you'll find yourself listening to time and again because the music and Derri's vocals make it perfect. ""The Ocean"" has a great chorus, and ""The Chicken"" has the best guitar riff I've heard in a long time. This cd is another great one from my favorite band, and it's excellent music to someone you might be talking to about God. The lyrics are deep and poetic, yet spiritual to the point that you can easily see the struggles of life in what's written. Buy this one and I can almost promise you that you'll be looking for their other cd's."
3,Definitely not choir music. It rocks a little,"I think I like this guitar oriented music. It may grow on me. It does have some very nice guitar texture and arrangement on salamander, ""Away with the swine"" has a nice beatlesqe feel to it ala the white album, Slow spin sounds a little like early Pink floyd say about UMMA GUMMA or Piper at the gates of dawn.Over all it is somewhat of a spiritual nature, though you realy have to dig deep for it.Not an ordinary band, a little unusual.Salamander is the best cut I think."
2,"Informative, but boring","Bought this book for my anthropology class, and even the professor decided after this one semester she wouldn't be having her class read this, because it is a very slow, boring read. It is very informative though, if you can make yourself sit down and read it."
2,Mediocre,"Lets start with the Book Description: ""this second edition includes numerical methods and computer code for solving problems"". This is simply not true. The book does not include 1 line of computer code, and of 928 pages only around 2 pages are concerned with numerical methods (a few results from the 1970s are quoted). Generally the book is confusing, e.g. by the order in which the different subjects are presented. Nielsen goes to great length in explaining simple things, and covers more difficult material only superficially. Moreover, the typesetting and the figures (many of them hand drawn) leave much to be desired..."
2,Bait And Switch,"I found this book interminable. I often found myself thinking, ""Get ON with it, already!""It's presented as a book about Bigfoot, but the author was plainly more interested in impressing the reader with his bona fides as a naturalist than he was in investigating, or even thinking much about, the Bigfoot phenomenon. If I'd wanted to read a book about trees and plants or a history of logging and forestry in the Pacific Northwest, I'd have looked for an appropriate field guide or historical tome.Recommended if you're interested in nature in a broad sense. If you're hoping to learn more about Bigfoot, not so much."
4,"Not Cracker's best, but still a good album","I bought ""Forever"" immediately upon its release, listened to it a couple of times, and then put it in the CD rack and let it gather dust. I love Cracker; I've seen them live numerous times; I own all the albums. Yet, something about ""Forever"" just didn't grab me when the album came out.Recently, I played it again, and my opinion of the album turned about 180 degrees. Songs like ""Miss Santa Cruz County,"" ""Ain't That Strange,"" and ""Sweet Magdalena of My Misfortune"" are channeled right from old school Cracker. ""Merry Christmas Emily"" is just plain fun. And the other songs show experimentation and growth over and above the band's previous body of work.Sure, a couple of songs still don't quite work for me. But this album is still a keeper, and if you're already a Cracker fan, you should own this."
4,Takes getting used to,"This one has moved from a 2 to a 4 in just 3 listens. I'm a huge fan of the Cracker sound found in Kerosene Hat. ""I want everything"" is one of my top ten songs of all time.Some of this new cd is similar to Kerosene Hat, such as Brides of Neptune, Sweet Magdalena of My Misfortune, and One Fine Day. The rest varies, and might or might not match what you expect from Cracker from previous albums.Personally, I agree that their attempt at rap on What You're Missing is really pathetic."
4,I am guarded by monkeys.,"I really like this album, and I adore the song ""Guarded by Monkeys."" I don't know that the album immediateyly grabbed me though. So maybe it does take some getting used to.Also, it never occurred to me to think of ""What You're Missing"" as a rap. I always thought it was more like - if you've ever seen the show ""Whose Line Is it Anyway?"", when they do a 'hoedown' on there. That's all I have to say."
3,"Not enough information, and too old","There is actually very little science in this series. Though it is fascinating to see footage from the first probes sent beyond Earth's orbit, there is not enough detail about the subject. For instance, there is no illustration of the distances between the planets, or their relative sizes. Though Cosmos is much older, it is still a much better introduction and to the joy and wonder of astronomy."
4,Beautifully narrated doco,"BBC doco of the Solar System research undertaken actively from the middle of the last century is narrated beautifully and concludes plenty of scientific data discovered by the Soviet and American expeditions.Good stuff if, one could say, even theories of British scientists presented frequently as de facto occurrence."
5,Don't buy this book to impress your Moroccan boyfriend.,"This book provides a lot of fun facts that make it easy to understand the Moroccan language, as well as culture. There is an easy-to-use pronunciation guide to get any beginner started, though some of the suggested sounds to make while attempting to pronounce certain phrases are difficult to master. This book seems to encompass what one would need to know for their basic travel needs, and most of what it does not cover in its text, it covers in its dictionary. This book is ideal for traveling due also to its small size. However, I would not recommend purchasing it for the purpose of attempting to communicate with your ESL (English as a Second Language) boyfriend, whom you cannot understand otherwise, because it probably won't be too helpful.(Especially if he dumps you because you can in no way marry him sometime in the near future)."
4,Great swaddle blanket,"This blanket was gifted to me and I use it regularly. The inner flaps are a bit hard to get the hang of to get them tight enough so they don't bunch or let the baby work his arms out, but I think swaddling has a learning curve no matter what swaddler you choose to use. Once my little one is tightly wrapped in this he is so much easier to put to sleep. From a parent with a little one who does not nap well because of flailing limbs, this has been a very good thing to have. He has never broken out of it when I have succeeded in swaddling him tight enough."
2,Baby hated this!,"I bought this for my Houdini baby who could get his arms free from any swaddlers. I had such high hopes that this would be the answer to more sleep, but he absolutely hated it. We used it three nights in a row and endured crying after he struggled and struggled to try to free himself. We gave up and went back to the Swaddlers Halo Sleep Sack, which he promptly pulled an arm from and started sucking on his hand. I think he likes the comfort of sucking and needs that (and isn't a pacifier kind of kid.). So this didn't work for us. Material is soft and seems high quality."
3,"Nice, but doesn't last long","This was great the first two months but my daughter outgrew it after that and could get her arms free easily. It is very handy the first two months, but it is kind of pricey for the short time period. The material is thin which is nice for summer, but the thin material easily rips and mine is 3 months old and already has a hole. I would recommend just purchasing a large thin blanket to swaddle. If you really have a hard time making a swaddle, this is handy."
2,Not for us,"Most people really like this, and I am in the minority of people who do not.The way this thing works is that you pin the baby's arms to their sides and use these mini wraps to hold the arms down. Then you use the large wrap to swaddle them up. To me, the mini arm wraps were hard to use because I couldn't hold the kid's arms down, use the wraps, and then wrap up the whole thing without him wriggling free. It was too many things to do all at once.In the end, we just used the large swaddling blankets we took home from the hospital. I don't know how others use a regular blanket for swaddling, but the way I do it only requires me to immobilize one arm at a time. Yes you have to learn how to do the multiple folds and that is too complicated for some people. But for us, it was just as escape proof as the miracle blanket but at a small fraction of the cost.Different strokes for different folks..."
2,Too Small,"Considering the great reviews, I was disappointed in this product. We bought this swaddle blanket when our baby was about 1 and 1/2 months, and it was already too small. She was able to get her legs out by pushing the bottom part down and creating a space in between the wrap and the bottom. When wrapped tighter she would push the entire thing down with her legs, thereby freeing her arms. Also, it's not really easy to put back on after middle of the night feedings, it's quite a long process."
2,Not a fan!,"This product is great in theory, but very impractical. the ""straps"" that wrap around the baby's arms are way to thick and bulky and so it bunches up underneath the baby and isnt comfortable. This swaddle also leaves the baby's legs way too much room to kick around and wake themselves up. It is aso tedious to have to unwrap this in the middle of the night to change a diaper. I was very dissappointed with this product so I returned it"
4,A Lifesaver!,"My husband and I purchased a miracle blanket after reading about it online. We were morons when it came to using a plain receiving blanket - our son would always wind up an unraveled mess. The MB is awesome - it wraps him tight and secures his arms so he can't get them free. It really seemed to calm him down when he was fussy. We couldn't do without it. Pricey, but worth it."
3,Not a miracle!,"This product has worked for my baby's arms but not her legs. She kicks her legs right out no matter how tightly I wrap her. I have ended up just leaving her legs out of the blanket.That said, the miracle blanket is great for swaddling her arms. There is a flap for each arm, and my baby is not able to free her arms.Another plus is that the miracle blanket is easy to use.I was using the kiddopotomus swaddle me, and my baby was able to break out of that--both arms and legs. That is why I purchased the miracle blanket. It is an improvement over the swaddle me, but the product needs to be tweaked such that the legs cannot be so easily kicked out."
1,Too many steps & dangerous,"I read all the good reviews and bought this miracle blanket for my 8 weeks baby. It was too many steps to swaddle the baby, and almost impossible to swaddle a cranky baby. My daughter did like it once she was swaddled, but in the morning when she was crying & kicking, the longer side of the wrap was wrapped around her neck, and her legs were already out. Dangerous!! I don't know why others like it so much, but it did not work for me."
4,Bob's Red Mill Baking Book Review,"Lots of information on various grains. Good recipes but not necessarily low in calorie or sugar (wanted more healthy recipes). Many recipes use items not commonly found in the pantry, most likely having to buy more than needed at a health food store. Uses the ingredient ""hard white whole wheat flour"" in many recipes but fails to give a description of that ingredient except in an excerpt from another recipe I happened to peruse which states it is AKA bread flour. Why not simply state ""bread flour""? Will adapt many recipes to use Splenda and less white flour. Overall a good book but wish there were pictures of the finished product and the nutritional information."
3,Everything from this book tastes like health food,"I was rather disappointed with these recipes. Every recipe I've tried comes out tasting like health food (dry and mediocre). I give it three stars, however, because with a few adjustments, the recipes can usually be improved. For example, adding an extra banana and another 1/4 cup oil to the Banana Flax bread makes it moist and yummy. So I keep it around because the recipes are great ideas; they just need tuning."
3,Needed to get through it,"If you have ""Starship Titanic"", Douglas Adams last CD-ROM game, this book will get you through it, plus there's some sly Adams wit sprinkled throughout."
4,Rio Chiba 256MB - Easy to use ( 1 hand) and sounds great.,"This unit Sounds great and is easly controled w/one hand while on the belt clip. No arm band provided though. includes FM stereo w/8 presets and manual tunning mode (yea). Headphones are in-ear type and sound very good: by way of comparison Sony MDR-G63 sportphones sound just slightly better. WinXP's Media Player 9 recognizes the Rio and can transfer songs, delete songs and format the player: but be careful as I somehow deleted all my songs once.Included software seems OK (I only had the unit 24 hours.)There's a firmware (software) upgrade available: The upgrade wasso easy I did'nt realize it was done and almost did it again.256MB = about 60 songs at a 128-192bps (Medium high bitrate).Now I just need a cheap SD mem card (It takes up to 1Meg of SD/MMC memory). And there's the rub. Once you get used to having your music on demand you'll wnat more, more, more.I gave 4 stars only because I have nothing to compare it to.MK"
3,Not for every man,Read this book if you are freaking out. try to find useful info. use what is relevant to you . Ignore the rest
3,Not great,"The item is a great idea, but the quality is not great. Within the 1st week I had the product, one of the straps on the hinge broke. But it still works. I've used it for over a month now."
1,"no, no, no, I DONT WANT ONE!!!!!!!!","This toy sucks. It's boring and it wakes me up all he time. I wouyld rcomend a Tama instead, they are WAY more durable and fun and educational."
1,"Gross, don't buy this.","I did not buy this product through Amazon, but it is the same brand and flavor, just as shown in the picture (I got it at Whole Foods this November (2012).As another reviewer noted, this product does include milk in the ingredients list.We made this product just as the directions instructed and found it to be inedible (and this is coming from someone who HATES to throw away food). It tasted and smelled terrible - very chemical-like and metallic. It certainly did not smell or taste ""natural"". I am really not sure how others found it to be great, and just like real gravy. I found it to be disgusting, and threw it all away. We ended up making our own vegetarian gravy out of vegetable broth and flour instead.I would not buy this product again, nor would I recommend that anyone else buy it."
4,Perfect for travel,This little gem goes in my cord organizer in the event that I go to a hotel where you have to go to the front desk to get a cat5 cord.
4,Solution for Powerbook Users,"From the manufacturer's website:If your laptop screen does not open far enough, adjustable legs can be screwed into the two threaded holes under the Oyster (never force your screen open). The adjustable legs will increase the degree of the angle needed to view your laptop screen. However, this correction may not be sufficient for all laptops.Instructions: You will need a package of ""rubber bumpers"" and 2 hex bolts (also known as machine bolts) 1 inches in length, diameter size #8, thread size 32. Place the rubber bumper over the head of the hex nut and screw into the threaded hole. The rubber bumpers rest on your desktop, providing the additional angle needed. These items are easily found in any hardware supply outlet."
4,Elegant and Functional,"I've had my oyster laptop docking station for almost two months now and I love it! It cleared my desk of clutter (all the cords are now hidden in the back), it means I don't have to use a separate monitor, and it makes it much easier for taking the laptop home from work at night (I now only have to unplug two cords). I get comments on it all the time from other people in my office, who are now going to buy their own!"
1,Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you buy this,"I read the reviews saying that the Rio Nitrus goes belly up after a couple weeks and thought, ""that's okay, it won't happen to me."" Well guess what, it did stop working on me. As of this writing, Rio has sent me 3 refurbished replacements, none of which has worked for more than a day. I am now caught in a viscious cycle of waiting for UPS to drop one off, finding out its another piece of sht, and sending it back.What really gets my goat is that the functioning player was great, and had a nice navigation and display and all the other stuff I wanted in an mp3 player. $170 later, though, I have nothing to show for it. Find another mp3 player! I command you!"
1,"Like everyone else says, great until it breaks...","Like everybody else, I absolutely loved this thing for the 11 or so days that I owned it, but I have to add myself to the list of people whose Nitrus broke within weeks of buying it. My problem wasn't UPGRADER, or timeouts, or any of the standard failures (which seem epidemic on their own). Mine became useless when the ""volume down"" button got stuck and stopped working. Looks like it was caused by cheap parts/manufacturing (and why volume BUTTONS? Anybody remember nice, reliable volume dials?). I was allowed to return it for a refund and not just another Nitrus that I'd never like. I consider myself lucky."
1,broken after an hour,"when i first got this out of the box I was really pleased with the product, the program on my pc made it really easy to make playlists and organize my music, however, my player began to freeze and after i restarted it with the paperclip in the emergency slot, the player would turn on and make a wierd clicking noise over and over again and the only thing it would display was the word ""upgrader"" I called the technical support center and my operater had a heavy accent and a soft voice, which was difficult to understand but they worked me through the problem and after taking all the neccesary steps the player still failed to work, I would just say this was a isolated defective player, however after reading the other reviews it seems that many other people have had similair problems. I would strongley recomend that you do not purchase this product"
2,"little problem, expensive solution","I, like many, loved my Nitrus. I got it as a X-mas present and it worked fine. Thankfully I didn't experience the dreaded ""Upgrader"" (yet)5 DAYS AFTER THE WARRANTY WAS UP the volume decrease button loosened up inside (or something); I considered this a miniscule problem.BUT The (unhelpful)Indian lady at support informed me that Rio DOESN'T a repair center but I could pay them another $125 to get a refurbished Nitrus OR save the money just buy another Rio.Given another chance I would've asked for an Ipod!"
4,Very Good,"About a year ago, i went shopping 4 my 1st MP3 player. I bought a 1.5GB RCA Lyra, but the songs didnt play. Then I got my good old Nitrus. YAY. it has a good amount of space, unless ur a person who wants to put EVRY SINGLE CD on ur MP3. In which case get sumthing from creative. i dont recommend IPODs because the wheel is flipping awful. anyway...battery life is good,design is good, buttons are good. the reason i gave it a 4 is becasue recently, the song have not played correctly. Im pretty sure its a problem with the equalizer. parts that are supposed to play are barely audible. hopefully this wont happen 2 u"
1,"The good, the bad, and the ugly...","I love my Rio Nitrus.. or so I did. I got it for X-mas. It was definatly my favroite gift, it was awesome. Holds hundreads of songs, the volume is loud, and it's pretty simple. But 3 months into having it and it's like the MP3 player from hell. I can't get it to work. It's constantly freezing, and I have to keep calling for help. Right now I'm probably going to return it, I wouldn't EVER buy it again."
1,Works great at first...,"I have gone through 2 Rio Nitrus players in the past 10 months. Both players completely froze up and could not be repaired. Fortunately for me, the first player was covered under their small 90-day window warranty. I received a new Nitrus (free) and it stopped working after 5 months. They've offered me a new player, but it will cost at least $100 to ""replace"". The other problem is that before both players were completely dead, they constantly had problems with turning on and off when changing songs. I was impressed with the Rio Nitrus when I first got it and convinced two other friends to buy them. They have also experienced the same problems and have since bought new mp3 players that do not bare the Rio name. I would not recommend this product unless you want an mp3 player that has a 5 month life-span. Please notice that most of the positive reviews of this player are old and were written when the person first received it."
1,Another Nitrus dies,"Add me to the disturbingly large list of people who have the Rio Nitrus just up and die after a few months. About 20 days after the warrenty expired (now we know why it is only a 90 day warrenty), I got the UPGRADER thing and the clicking hard drive. I went to the manual and the solution is to re-set the device using a paperclip (did that but problem persisted) then re-load the firmware update but the problem is you can't do that while the hard drive is clicking (it will time out). If I leave the Rio on for 10 to 15 minutes, the clicking stops. I can then load the firmware but then the device just gets stuck on RESTARTING for ever. From what I've read it sounds like my RIO is dead and I'm SOL.It's too bad because I absolutely loved it while it was working. But no way I'd buy another Rio product and I certainly can't recommend this one."
5,I take it everywhere,"I've had my Nitrus for well over a year now and have NEVER had a problem with it. No software problems, no update problems, no ""Click"" problems, no nothing. It works as amazingly as it has from day one and I really couldn't live without it. It fits in your pocket easily and takes absolutely no intelligence to work at all. I threw out the earbuds right away since I really hate them and they don't stay in my ears for more than 3 minutes. But with the right headphones, the sound is crystal clear and wonderful. I highly recommend Rio -- it's the only kind I buy."
1,Not Worth The Trouble,"After about 3 mths of use the Rio Nitrus completely crapped out on me. If I hadn't purchased the extended warrranty (which it took 3 mths to receive back the product) I wouldn't have had the opportunity to experience the second failure. It is the same problem; all of a sudden the product will not turn on, it just doesn't work. I will not purchase another Rio Product again."
4,great device,"i've carried this thing halfway around the world and it's never let me down; easy file transfer from cd, great battery life and solid playback. good audio quality from .wma and .mp3 file formats (could accept more formats in playback), but, overall, a very happy addition to my collection."
2,Great sound--short on great songs,"This cd has great sound but lacks many of the Hollies greatest songs. I guess it was released for people who are short of money to spend on great music. Don't get me wrong, all of the songs on this cd are great, but to get a whole idea of what the Hollies were all about is to get one of their box sets with over 40 to 50 songs on them--all great with 4 or more cds. But, if money is short I suggest you get this one that has a good sampling of what they are like.."
5,It rocks!,The product arrived way sooner than I expected. The stainless steel workmanship is beautiful. Don't buy aluminum - you'll only be disappointed. It's worth the extra money for stainless steel. We fried two turkeys with it in 20 degree weather (with a stiff breeze!) and it performed flawlessly. Cleanup was a snap. The only thing I would like to see added would be a wind shield for the burner.
4,Cowboys are people,This book on Kiskaddon is more than a nostalgic collection of cowboy poetry. It offers several short stories that help us learn what life was like in the early twentieth century. The stories show cowboys poking fun at each other in an era before there was television and computers to amuse people. As you read the stories and poems you begin to formalize a picture of whom these people are. The stories give us a wonderful snapshot of a period of American life through the eyes of an editor who has caught the period in the works of Kiskaddon and his illustrator Fields.
2,"Hey, this stuff's cut!",A promising line-up but the cuts are mostly disappointing poorly recorded live versions. Spring for the Nuggets collection.
3,Disappointed With One Feature,I bought the phone because I thought the custom ringing features would work with Private Caller numbers. They don't.
2,Makes me not want to study,"First of all, I havent touched the book - only the CD-rom which contains the exact same material. I think it would be really annoying to have to keep flipping through the pages to find the answers. The book is 95% just question and answers. The CD-rom works well, but the problem is the questions. They are on the whole so difficult and lengthy that it makes it quite a chore to get through them without getting frustrated after 15 minutes. I am sure many of the questions contain obscure material that will simply not be on the test. The answers/explanations are also often vague and not useful at all. This program makes me feel totally ill equipped to take the national exam and I know I am not in as bad shape as this would have me believe. It makes me want to give up studying altogether, and that can't be good."
4,"Excellent, but CD does not include the actual songs!","The Book is great, offering multiple approaches to every song, including multiple basic beats, intermediate and advanced, along with 30 sec samples of most approaches on the CD. WHich is great.What I also expected, based on the description, was the actual full songs of the Vol 1 CD of Turn it up, Lay it down. However, you still have to buy the actual CD for the complete song tracks in addition to this book/CD.However, it's still worth it, as this book/CD delivers way more than $20-25 worth of instruction."
1,Utterly pathetic,"The script is on the grade school level and barely coherent. The acting is junior high quality at best. And what little music there is in the film is of minimal quality, featuring lousy imitations of the Mills Brothers, the Ink Spots, and Louis Armstrong. The appearance of Gene Krupa, lasting about a minute, does not enhance the quality of the film at all. My guess is that this film, designed for black movie theaters, was shot in a day or two. Poor Tim Moore. I'm discarding my DVD copy."
1,Worst deal of my life,"Many reviews already talk about the horrific quality of this device.Long story short:Got it, lasted 4 weeks, sent it back to Rio, six weeks later I got a new one, lasted another 6 weeks.Now Rio is saying that I'm done with the warranty period. If it only had died before they would be able to replace it.The great solution the customer service rep had for me was an ""out of warranty"" replacement for the bargain price of $200.I'm done doing business with Rio and so should everybody else."
2,Really poor customer service,Rio has really poor customer service.You'll need free long-distance because you'll wait 20 minutes per level as you try to get to someone who knows what they are doing (I never did get to anyone who could actually help). I strongly suspect Rio farms-out CS to the lowest bidder.Woe unto you if your Rio product is last year's model. Rio is in the selling business not the customer satisfaction business. I'll be looking for a different manufacturer after Christmas when I replace this ... item.
1,Not an IPod!,"It's a toy, not to be taken serious. Have you ever had dealings with this company? They are hardly Apple! Buy a Tivo, not Replay (this company). Buy a IPod, not this fake."
1,the rio karma is janky,"I got my Rio last December and by January I had problems with it.it would freeze up and I would have to wait for the battery to die before I could use it again. I sent it back to the manufacture and 3 months later I had the same problem not to mention that my 6 year old cd player skipped less when snowboarding then the karma. yeah I realize it's a MP3 player but it would hick up after I hit a kicker or rail. I then sent the second one back and I'm now on my third. It to is just as janky as the first two! it freezes at the startup and wont play anything! I HATE THIS RIO KARMA. Damn a pox on Rio for ever making this piece of #@$!. So don't be like me kids save you money & your hair, get an ipod.Pablo"
2,Dead after 4 months -- was fun while it lasted,"I really enjoyed this device when it was working, and thought the Rio Music Manager software was well done. Ripping CDs and synchronization worked very well. Only problem I ever had was with purchased downloaded music in the highest bit rate WMA format, with the workaround of burning a CD from it and then ripping that. Device worked fine in car and on the rack of treadmill in the gym. Unfortunately, machine no longer operates properly 1 month after warranty expired. It barely boots up, requires constant hard reset, and now is totally dead as it can't load firmware anymore. I had no problem reaching customer service but they want $175 to send me a refurbished unit. I've seen a lot of similar experiences in user forums so I would steer clear of this unit unless you really enjoy the gamble!"
1,90 day warranty!,I am afraid to say that my son's rio karma's hard drive failed 4 months after purchase .Otherwise he really loved it . I wonder how many others have gone the same way . I wish I had taken out an extended warranty
4,Easy and Small,"I bought my mp3 player two months ago, and i'm very happy with.Easy to use and is nice to your eyes, no problems so far."
2,returned 3 times and it still didn't work...,"At first I was really happy that I had avoided iPod mania... I bought the Rio Karma about 1.5 years ago as a result of a quest to go for capacity and style at a reasonable price and not cave to the cute little iPod... I have a huge cd collection and wanted the ability to listen to anything in my collection at any time... at first, the Rio Karma provided this and I was very happy... about 2-3 months after I purchased the item, it broke down... In this whole process, I ended up sending back the replacement to recieve a 3rd player, which has never worked properly... it had problems transferring all of my tracks, froze several times in doing so, and won't play half of my tracks, as they show up as corrupted. I just got the new iPod video... I had no problems tranferring my music files... all of the songs that I was not able to play on the Karma, play fine on the iPod... should have caved to the iPod craze in the first place..."
1,Buyer beware - great concept with terrible reliability.,"This is a wonderful product, out of the box. The UI and included software are very intuitive. The accessories are great. The docking station even has a cool blue light on it. But take a look around the forums - hard drive failures are everywhere. Mine stopped working about 14 months after purchase, had not been abused and had been used only indoors and in the car. Now I have a three-bill pile of junk. Buy this product only if you have limitless patience for wasting money, and easy access to surplus laptop hard drives."
2,Disappointing - sounds muffled and flat,"I have to disagree strongly with the review below which says that the sound quality on this disc is ""superb."" It's not. In fact, it's one of the worst sounding discs I've purchased in a long time. On many of the cuts the higher frequencies are missing; this is probably because over long periods of time, recordings on tape (i.e. the master tapes used to produce this CD) deteriorate. As a result, the music sounds dull and muffled. Also, I was surprised how dated many of these songs are, both in musical style and the lyrics. I was a big fan of QMS ""back in the day,"" but this disc is a loser."
1,Better Remembered,"This album/CD was only a few dollars, thankfully! It had, perhaps, two cuts that were worth remembering. Too bad I didn't remember that when I took the offer (like a hungry trout).It's better left in the dust bin."
4,60's revisited,"Great walk down memory lane. I had forgotten their unique sound, and I enjoyed listening to it once again. You can hear the band grow and change as they moved from rock and roll to their Quicksilver sound."
3,Slow Moving,"Since I am not a writer I shouldn't critize, but I am a avid reader. I thought this story was sort of the clean-up to The Price of Blood (I think that's right). There was a story running through but the action didn't get rolling until the last thirty or forty pages.Stallone is making a movie from this book and I am curious to see what he will do with it."
3,ordered wrong book,"I meant to order a book by Chuck HOGAN, but Amazon adds in other authors in the HOGAN search, and since I wasn't paying attention, I made a mistake."
4,Must read for all real estate professionals!,"A page turner. American Dream is alive and well in NYC. From $1000 to $2 billion in 25 years, selling the business for $70 million, tricks of the trade, bully the bully (Donald Trump), hire the best attitudes, the best lawyer is not the one that knows the law...... are practical business tips to survive. I met Barbara at a conference in Rockland County, NY where she gave a talk about this venture. But reading the book gives much in-depth knowledge. I will use this book in my Marketing and Management classes at the College level. This real-life success book is much better than the cases that are published by the Harvard Business School."
2,Not a sales book - lemonade making more like it,"After reading the book, I sent an email to the author and immediately received a response asking that I ""put my thoughts down on amazon.com"". On one hand, I thought she was brilliant. On the other hand, I was rip-roaring mad. So you figure out if it's worth a read. The nicknames really annoyed the beejeebers out of me...hee haw."
5,THE Best Album of 2006,"I haven't been able to take this absolute masterpiece from going repeat for the past month, it's seriously been the only thing I've been listening to. Every song is beautifully crafted with delicate precision, huge hooks, and a lot of those loud ""DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN..."" parts, you know what I'm talking about. Singing is quiant and so is the music even though the lyrics are mainly on the darker side. Average time of each song is about 4 minutes each. Perfect opener and closer, the closer is what makes me want to listen over again, I think, just how it slowly fades the album away and then the beginning fades it back in.STRONGLY recommended for fans of Sgt. Pepper."
4,Very good story,"While I don't like it as much as the previous books in the series, it's still great storytelling. I especially liked Nathan Morgan (the photographer) and Allie (I think I remember the character's name right). The book was as riveting as the others, but I didn't quite like the whole story as much, probably because of the more modern time period. Still, it's a good read with the same emotion, drama, adventure, and romance as the others!"
5,One of my favorite Golden Books,"I had looked for this book for a long time, as it was one of my favorites as a child. The drawings were so cute and my daughter loves the bunnies in the story. A cute Little Golden Book."
2,How would a lion eat both kangaroos and zebras?,This book depicts a lion in the wild that eats both Zebras (East Africa) and Kangaroos (Australia). There's no good reason for a book to mislead a child like that.
4,BUY IT!,"I was actually at this show (yeh, we had to wait around for about 25 minutes while they fixed the power). The show had a great setlist, and NFG performed really well. Its everything you would have expected from a NFG show, and i think it would be great to own it on DVD.i give it 4 stars, simply because to be 5 stars, it would need to be truly AMAZING.. this was just very very good, ie: 4 stars."
5,"Love it, Love it, Love it!!!!","I'm overwhelmed.This one is a keeper for your media library. Not mushy or overly emotional. Hope, joy, love...real love, the desire to benefit another at the expense of oneself. That's what I saw in this work.Sandra Bullock: fabulous work. I hope to be just like her when I grow up!"
1,bad,sent it back. could not watch it. was ruined by heat or something. got thru first 20 minutes then it just froze
5,Heart warming and wonderful.,"This is based on a true story and I will not give any spoilers. If you are looking for a movie that helps you believe there is goodness in people, then this is the film to watch. The actors are amazing and it may be Sandra Bullock's best role ever. Don't miss this one!"
3,good movie,good movie to buy for the money.got it as a christmas gift and they like it.they wanted this movie for a while.
5,Excellent movie!!,The Blindside is an excellent movie! I saw it in theatres and waited until it came out on DVD. I would recommend this movie to anyone!
5,One of my favorite movies,"What can I say. I love ""feel good"" movies and this is one of the best I ever saw. Sandra Bullock again shows that she is an ""actress"" not just a whiney voiced romantic comedy fixture. She conveys with absolute believability the affection she feels for her new ""son"" and the lengths she will go to to protect him. The fact that this is a true story just makes it more wonderful. Nice to know that there are really people like this family still alive and well in our country. Supporting cast is excellent. Beautifully filmed,directed and acted."
5,The Blind Side,"Wonderful movie, have watched it many times,and enjoy having a copy of my own to watch any time I want."
5,THE BLIND SIDE,"GOES TO SHOW A MOVIE CAN BE MADE WITHOUT ALL THE SO CALLED ""artistic"" SWEARING>.FEEL GOOD MOVIE!!!!!!!!"
1,Patting yourself on the back,"This movie is nothing but white folk patting themselves on the back for helping a ""poor black kid"" off the streets. Never once does the movie give credit to Michael Oher for his amazing accomplishments."
5,AWESOME!,This was a great movie!....So few times can we walk away from a movie and be thankful that this was a real life event. Renews your faith in people. This was uplifting and heart warming...something seldom seen anymore..especially from hollywood. This was a great film and will have you walking away feeling empowered and joyous!
5,Words Cannot Describe This Film,"This is an EXCELLENT film and I will watch it again and again. There is such a feeling that just makes you feel ""warm"" inside and I don't care who you are, but if you are human, you will feel emotion if you are able and let yourself go. EXCELLENT FILM.... EXTREMELY WELL DONE BY ALL INVOLVED....."
3,Akin to a made-for-TV movie,"Too much stereotyping, not enough depth. Lifetime TV would have been a great venue for this bit of fluff. I truly wanted to like this film, but there was just not much substance as the entire storyline was: rich white family saves poor black kid, black kid makes good."
5,Great movie.,This is a must see. I watch it every night when I am going to sleep. It is a very inspiring movie.
5,Prime chick flick,Get out the popcorn and have a good night sleep after this feel good bout with a lala mix of family and life memories occupy the realm of warm fuzzies.Be into feel good endings and tears of joy...
5,The Blind Side,Fantastic movie.Never a dull or boring moment.Heart warming.Amazon service has always been great too.Thanks for all your help.
5,Incredible Movie,This is an incredible movie based on a great book. A must-have! It is one of my favorites and is always a tear-jerker
5,The Blind Side,"A great story and many excellent life principles reflected in the choices. Something that all ages could enjoy. Great, clean movie."
5,Worth Every Penny,"The title says it all. Finally, a clear, concise explanation of all the screens, buttons, menus and layouts. What also surprised me is how well this served as a primer on the basics of sound synthesis, i.e. LFO's, Oscillators, Filters etc. Can't recommend it enough."
5,Great for This Newbie,"This is the first MP3 player I've owned, and I couldn't be happier. I had all kinds of questions after reading these reviews, and the RIO cali seemed very robust. This might be my second review but I just plugged in a 256 mb SD expansion card, and zip, up it goes, working just fine. I use the wma format, and can now fit 11 albums on this thing. The headphones are very nice, but you can't loan it to anyone, you don't want their earwax on the headphones (ugh!) PLENTY of volume, though, drowns out my micromanaging boss quite well! Music transfer with the rio music manager is completely easy, I copy my cd's into my computer (no, I don't download mp3's) using windows media player and then rio music manager finds them and voila! Playlists are easy to set up and use. So until I know better, I'm completely satisfied."
5,Rio Cali doesn't disappoint,"Excellent mp3 player, one of the few to have mp3 player, FM tuner, expandable and backed by a reputable company. I purchased this over the SDIO because I read bad reviews on the SDIO as far as customer service and conscruction. iRiver, another mp3 player I was considering, is not expandable. This is a reasonable priced mp3 player that is perfect for someone with an active lifestyle. The FM tuner isn't as good as it should be though, I get static on it sometimes. The color selection could be better as well.Read my in depth review at: http://www.epinions.com/content_129760464516"
4,Great player for workouts,"When I workout, I like to workout for a while, generally more than 3 hours. So I purchased this player (256MB Rio Cali), a 128MB SimpleTech Secure Digital Card, and a 512MB SanDisk Secure Digital Card. I put my base set of songs on the Rio itself, and different suites of songs on each of the additional memory cards, with the idea of using one card or another depending on the workout/day. Downloading was easy using the enclosed software, and also via Windows Media Player 9. I've had no problems using Windows XP.NOTE: One strange thing I found was that I could only download songs onto the Rio and have it recognize the additional memory cards when I removed the battery from the player.The headphones are of fine quality, and their soft cushioning doesn't hurt my ears. The armband strap is soft, and the velco very grippy.And if my MP3 collection wasn't enough, the Radio Tuner works great. It is easy to bookmark stations, and I had no problem picking up all my local favorites."
2,"Poor sound, even worse earbuds","Strapped for cash, I've been forced to stick with this player for a couple years. The player has indeed taken lots of knocking around, but I have two complaints:1) There is background hum behind all my music. You can really hear it between songs and during quieter passages. Because of this, I couldn't use it to listen to electronic books because the hum was so darn loud and annoying. An email to Rio tech support asking about this was ignored, which really cheesed me off. Their support is awful.2) The wires to the earbuds broke during the second use. I've had duct tape on them for the last two years, but they permanently gave out the other day (something broke in the connector where even tape could not help)."
2,"Good player, horrible software","I love my Rio--especially because of the FM radio functionality--but I hate the software you have to use to transfer tunes. Half the time I can't see what is on the player or the playlists that I want to send over show up as blank (which means you have to play songs from the ""all music"" function. Long story short, it's just not user friendly--at all.Other than that, it's a great size, nice buttons, seems very sturdy."
1,Rio Should Be Ashamed of Itself,"Rio should be ashamed of itself -- they are aware of the ""upgrader"" problem, but simply refuse to service these devices. Save your money and buy an mp3 player that will last."
1,Gracenote registration is dead,"The gracenote registration on my cali no longer functions. So if you buy this product you will have to individually label every song you rip to MP3 format. I've downloaded the latest software and re-registered with gracenote, but no luck. There is no support for this issue on the Rio website. Buy another player."
2,Disappointed Rio fan,"I had my player a couple months, but it hit concrete and BROKE. Can't believe it. I was just outside the warranty, so I must buy a new one!I do not like the joystick--more difficult to use when you are running or snowskiing and don't want to pull it out to look at it. It is much harder to figure out which way is play or pause or stop than individual buttons.I have the Rio500 (when the company was RioDiamond)from 5 or so years ago and it still works--and I've dropped it everywhere--even in water--and sweated all over it. Unfortunately the software is outdated so I can no longer upload songs onto it. I still love it (even though it only holds about 18 songs w/out an extra memory card!).SO, where do I go from here? which Rio product will hold up? I have lost faith now that the company has changed. The SPORT product did not hold up. Obvious problem with quality."
3,not at user friendly as I hoped,"My first MP3 player purchase, I was looking for something my wife could use while running, less cumbersome and less likely to skip compared to her portable CD player. Amazon had better reviews for the cali than the nike model.Likes: small, easy to wear, good sound quality, comfortable ear piecesDislikes: product arrived with base language in French (phone call to rio support walked me through rebooting it), unable to transfer my itunes directly into my rio manager, can only hold about two CD's of music.Overall I regret not saving the extra money for an ipod with greater storage and only slightly larger size."
1,Problems with Rio - Buggy!,"Save your money, save your time. Search the web for ""Rio"" and ""upgrader"" and you'll quickly realize that this device (like all Rio MP3 players) is buggy and prone to failure after only a few months. We've had ours since Christmas 2003, so it's dead after 9 months.Unfortunately, Rio offers one of the shortest warranties, and their customer service is terrible. The ""fix"" they offered was to replace my Cali with a refurbished model - at a cost of a hundred dollars! Well you can see here at Amazon that a new model doesn't cost much more, so that's hardly a good solution.Avoid the Cali, avoid Rio, save up your money and get a reliable player like an iPod instead.P.S. You may find some methods posted in web forums for fixing the upgrader bug in Rio Chibas, but I could not get my Cali to work using the same methods. I also reformatted the device and reinstalled the firmware but nothing has helped."
2,It did okay for a while,I had my wife buy this for me for gym use. That way I wouldn't have to listen to BORING 24Hr fitness music. Initially it worked fine. Downloading was easy and the software was user friendly. The sound was rather &amp;quot;flat&amp;quot; though. I like a lot of hip hop and the sound was mediocre. The radio easily lost reception while moving around in the gym. After a few weeks it started shutting of in mid song so I replaced the batteries. NO JOY. It still was shutting off. So I returned it to Walmart in hopes that exchanging it for the 256 CHIBA would be better. I will let you guys know if it was worth it.
3,Good For Running But Rotten Software,"I am mostly happy with my Rio Cali. I bought it mainly to use while running. Initially I had a problem with it just shutting off after about 25 minutes but when I installed the new firmware that went away.I think that the sound quality is good and I really like the extremely sturdy belt clip.The biggest complaint that I have about the Cali is I hate the software that it works with. I found it to be virtually impossible to get the songs to play in the order that you wanted them to play. I found that I could get this done if I went into Windows Explorer and renamed each song by putting a number in front of it. So if I wanted ""Song Title 1"" to play first I renamed it ""0001 Song Title 1"". This works but is a pain since you have to do this for each song and then it is a bigger pain if you want to reorder songs or add new ones. The bottom line is that this software is just a much bigger hassle than it should be for what seems like a simple task."
3,RIO CALI MP3 128 Sport,"Decent product for the price, but I'd spend a little more and get something more reliable. The headphones fell apart the week I got it, the software is confusing and full of bugs. I've pretty much experienced what all the bad reviews of this product referenced. The playback of the music sounds decent--hard to tell with the headphones so messed up."
2,Upgrader,"If you have owned one of the Rio MP3 players you will know what this means. I have owned two Cali's (256)- one return and the one I am throwing in the garbage. After several attempts to upgrade the system through their website to no avail. (Often called the upgrader bug). Cool design and very comfortable, but does not work. Go to their website (...) and you can read for yourself some very frustrated users."
3,Don't buy if you want it to last for more than a year...,"I have had my rio for about 8 months now, and recently discovered that it will not recognize sd cards. I bought the card so I could expand the memory on my rio, and didn't realize till afterwards there is a problem with them and they don't recognize the cards. I was told by rio they are working on a fix, hopefully in the next few weeks (???). Also, careful if you drop it, I accidentally did, and now I cannot turn the volume up or down. Also, I have read some rios have errors where it will say ""upgrade"" and there is no way to fix it, it will eventually freeze that way and you'll just have to buy a new one."
1,dont buy this,"this product is worthless, poorly constructed, no customer suport,(beware) and the book I oredered from amazon never arrived"
2,Genius 12x9,"Seems to work OK.Limited extras compared to Wacom tablets.OK for the price.Would I buy it again... yes, if I couldn't afford a Wacom."
5,sonic,"This was the first product of this type and as far as I am concerned, the best. Has kept my teeth and gums in perfect condition."
5,Best for Gum Maintenance,My wife has used this equipment for several years. Excellent results! Must use for maximum prevention from gum related problems.
2,To good to be true?,"My wife and I enjoy strong coffee (espresso roast) and the Capresso seemed to be a great machine - for three months - and then it started clogging and clogging and ...Thought we just bought a bad unit and returned it for a new one. Sadly the new unit suffered the exact same problem with the oily beans clogging up the chute.We now use the Krups gring/brew and it is worse! At the end of the grind/brew cycle, the Krups emits steam (to cleanse the machine.) The steam ends up running down the sides of the machine and all over the counter. Needless to say we are still looking for a ""bulletproof"" grind/brew coffeemaker.Based on my homework - people who enjoy really strong coffee seem to suffer our same fate. We continue to look."
4,Works great for me...,"It seems that there are two camps - those who hate it and seem to have all sorts of build quality problems, and those like myself who love this machine.I have never had any problems with leaks or flavor. I keep the setting on the finest grade, and I also use the exact amount of water (not the recommended 'add an additional cup') - otherwise it tends to be too watery. I also keep the setting on the strongest possible.My only issue is the quality of the plastic used could be better. But in my search, features were my primary concern."
3,"Its not the beans, stupid!","I have had this coffee machine for over three years. Mine does not have a timer but otherwise it is like the 452.01. I do get a very good cup of coffee but it takes alot of adjusting the amount of water, number of cups brewed and grind. There are only four settings and they do not vary much that I can tell. There is no way to get a very fine grind and often with certain kinds of coffee you have to use twice the coffee to get 75% of the strength of a heavier brew. Mechanically, I have had no trouble with it. It works as it should but I think at this level one can expect more ease of brewing."
4,Before the gold.,"People who have an interest in the US amateur ice hockey program will want to read this book in order to fill gaps in what has become the accepted story of the team before victory in the Lake Placid games(1980). The authors, with the unlikely names of Tom and Jerry, do a good job prsenting their case that the tools used to win an Olympic gold metal were forged by an earlier team and passed on to those who followed. Anyone interested in the deveopment of North American hockey will learn from this tale."
3,Striking Silver,"Very interesting and a good, quick read. It was enlightening to get the rest of the story, and frankly, before someone told me about this book, I didn't realize that the USA team won the silver in 1972. We all know about the 1980 Dream Team, it's time we now find out more about this outstanding group of men!"
2,Not Durable!,"I loved this set and was so pleased to finally have it. Imagine my disapointment when after only a month of use, almost every piece is chipped. Not just little chips, but big chunks out of the plates, mugs bowls etc. Also they say these dishes are microwaveable safe, however, use great care in handling these dishes out of the microwave...I have been burned badly more times then I care to remember. Love the pattern, hate the craftsmenship!!!"
3,Slow in starting subscription,"They were 2 weeks late in starting my year long subscription and still charged me the 2 weeks toward my subscription. Also I have not been getting my magazine every week, I know they have missed a couple weeks so far. I like the magazine when i get it."
1,Manchurian Avenger,"This is not as much a review as a correction. The product description says that Kayla Blake played the role of Bobby Kim's sister in this film. The part was actually played by Leila Hee Olsen (who is definitely not an AKA for Kayla Blake). It was her first film role. Other than that, the film is possibly the slowest action movie ever filmed. Bill ""Superfoot"" Wallace simply fades away at the end of his fight with Bobby Kim because he refused to allow himself to be killed in this movie. The most frequent remark I've heard concerning this flick is that Bobby Kim bears a remarkable resemblance to the late Charles Bronson (but is much shorter)."
4,Quiet and aesthetically pleasing,"We use this fan at an open window at the foot of our bed.. It makes those humid, 75 degree nights quite bearable if you shed the blankets and most of your night clothes. Low and medium speeds are not that noisy. The fan is an ascetically attractive element in our bedroom."
4,Good router,"I liked the one I bought myself, I bought one for my mom's house so when I visit her I can connect to the internet without unplugging the connection to her desktop computer.I get a decent signal throughout my house."
3,Okay if straight sight line,Claims of speed and range are overstated unless you have a straight sight line from the router to the computer.
4,nice but a few misses,"Router has good range and stability. Even older 11g cards work well with this product. Usually get 36-48Mbps connections in the furthest reaches of the house. However it's a premium router and you'd expect more polish. Avoid the cd-setup. The menu navigation is cumbersome compared to most - especially if you know what you need like selecting ssids, wpa and mac filters. A glaring weakness is that you can only restrict MAC addresses on wireless connections so ethernet cable connections can't be secured. Also makes for an interesting nitelite."
5,Excellent,"I have had this router for about 4 years- still very impressed. Thinking about buying a new router for my one N device but am worried to mess with a good thing. Have had a problems with some other Netgear products but not this one. If you just want G- I would highly recommend. I use AT&T DSL/Speedstream 5100 modem, 3PC/1MAC/WII/ROKU/2IPHONE. I use a Dynamic DNS service with this device so I don't need to have pay for a static IP- has worked great as well."
1,The wifi gets disconnected very frequently,I have to reset my router 10 to 15 times a day to enable wifi.No idea whether amazon sold defective piece or this model itself is defective.very frustrating
2,great range but odd problems,"My download rates are phenomenal with this router. No complaints for the first few months. Then the wireless signal would just drop for no reason. First it seems like the cable modem would die and I had the cable modem replaced. The problems continued. I had installed a ""windows home server"" which uses UPnP plug and play feature on the router to manage routes from the web to the home server. I switched off UPnP on the router and it appears my trouble with dropped signals went away. I manually set up a few static routes for the home servers remote access.I am thinking the home server and the router are not too compatible and the UPnP was probably getting reset far too often resulting in the router hanging."
2,nothing but trouble,"I just bought a brand new Dell laptop and decided the way to go was wireless..bought the computer and Netgear at Best Buy. the box said easy to install and from the reviews it seems that way too....so how come I put in the CD and followed the instructions...thought it was working and then lost my roadrunner email and internet connection. And when i went back to ""connect"" I had Netgear and Netgear 2...I would connect and it would tell me I was connected but there was no connection...so don't tell me how easy this is to use. I've ended up hiring someone to come over to install it correctly...I'm back to just using my cable connection. It's going to cost me a sweet 100 bucks to have it set up and secure. and then I sure hope it works."
4,good,Easy to setup will take a few minutes and works great. I have it set up to be wired to my desktop and transmit wireless for my laptop. There is a button on the rear that turns off the neat but bright blue lights of the system in case the lights get too annoying. On two occasions my wireless signal was not being accepted by my laptop. I think it was my cordless phone (2.4ghz) which is close to the router and might interfere with wireless connection.Overall a great product setup took a few minutes and the secure wireless set up was straight forward and not too complicated like other routers.
5,Sweet Buy,"Just bought this router yesterday and so far it is great. The set up was very simple. I just followed the setup CD step by step and was done in about 20 minutes. I also bought the matching notebook card which connects at 108 mbps. There was a minor flaw in the setup though that when I tried to connect to the internet it wouldn't let me, (don't let this happen to you), I had entered my wireless settings different from my basic settings this is very important...it must match exactly or you won't connect. Also be sure to turn on the rangemax service during the setup process. Very nice product especially with the notebook card. 108mbps is incredible on a wireless connection. I even tested out Diablo II on it (on Battle.Net of course) and there was no lag! Great connection. In a few months I will write another review to see how it does after prolonged use."
1,Wireless router for people in glass houses.,"Don't believe the ""RangeMax"" claim of extended range on this router. I have 2 desktop computers and a laptop and was upgrading my old router to the G format for greater range and speed. This router has less range than my old B type wireless router. I had more ""dead spots"" than a morgue! I found the wireless plug-in access port accessory useless even when I put the small notebook wireless adapter right next to the plugged access point. Signals would drop like flies. I bought Linksys Rangeboost router and had NO problems with the same computers in the same locations. Buyer Beware of NetGear claims!!!"
2,Great wireless range - but it needs frequent reboots,"Compared to the Linksys router I replaced, this WPN824 has an awesome range. But, I have owned the router for three days and have had to reboot it 5 times. It will appear that it is running, but none of the computers on my network can access it or the internet. Once I reboot it by unplugging and pugging it back in, then all of my computers can get to the internet. I am going to give their customer support one attempt to resolve this before I take it bake to the store. I am running hte v1 router and not the v2 - I do not know if that makes a difference."
3,Netgear 824,"The router works great but, the support is really bad. Waited 45 mins then got someone who did not speak english well. To tell me that I did not register. Found my email showing that I did called back waited another 30 mins to state that I do not understand when all I asked is how to get the wireless printer setup in the netgear program. They hung up after they stated they did not understand. If you are a computer specialist this would be great but, if you do not know a lot about computers then you can forget about getting help from netgear. You will have to go someone else if you can find anyone to help you. Luckly my son works on computers so he help a lot."
4,Thumbs up - twice,"I have had great success covering houses that have the router on one side and the notebook/pc on the others side about 60ft+ and on different floors. Here are a couple of hints though:1 - do not use the installation disk, just hook up a pc to the router and follow the instructions in the quick-install sheet.2 - do the firmware upgrade, most of them ship with 1.0.3 and now there is 1.0.103 - enable the xr feature under ""advanced wireless""4 - use the corresponding notebook/desktop card: while strongewr than most routers, MIMO needs an intelligent counterpart. So if you cant get a signal where you need it, drop the money on the card the resukts are great - in one case I was able to connect through 60ft of house and into a yard an additional 150 more feet away and downhill!!!"
2,No extra coverage,I was hoping to solve a difficult coverage issue(router located upstairs corner room) to get coverage throughout the house. This router was replacing a Netgear WGT624. I think the old router gave better coverage. I am getting more loss of coverage on the other end of the house. I don't have a mimo pc card.If I had kept the box I would probably return it to Amazon and get my money back.
1,"""Limited or No Connectivity""","This wireless router drops the signal frequently requiring a reboot to restore connectivity. This has been under discussion in Netgear's own user forum for several months now - multiple users having the same problem. Netgear has not responded to or offered any advice on fixing the problem, leaving users to try numerous approaches - none of which work. Latest firmware, multiple OS patches, etc. Stay away from this waste of silicon and plastic! Look at Linksys or perhaps Belkin, instead! Very disappointed in the product AND, even more importantly, the lack of support from Netgear."
1,Keep your old Netgear router,"I bought this new router because of the ""claims"" that it had great coverage in a home. No, worse than my old Netgear router. I have speeds that vary from 54 to 48 to even 24 when I am 5 feet away from the router. I just printed my labels to return it to Amazon. Luckily amazon has a great return policy."
5,My first router,"I finally got rid of Dial-up last month and got DSL. My friend recommended this router and CNet reviewed it as one of the best routers in the market today along with Belkin Pre-N router, which would've been my second choice if this netgear didn't work. My desktop is directly wired to the internet and three other computers are wireslessly connected: a desktop and two laptops. So far, I don't have any complaints. Two thumbs up."
1,Terrible Experience,"Terrible buying experience in every way. After 3 days of trying to set it up and numerous hours wasted on the line with Netgear tech support, I never got this working correctly. I'm not computer illiterate, and I have had great success with several Linksys routers, but this product was simply terrible. Between the bad product and the bad tech support this was just an awful purchase. I'm returning it and getting a better quality product.Just because its more expensive than Netgear's other junky wireless products, doesn't mean its better."
1,Watch out,"When this router arrived, it didnt come with the standard packaging. I realized this was a refurb, which made sense as to the low price. It was NOT clearly marked as a refurb and I am currently researching to see if it was advertised as brand new merchandise.To make matters worse, port forwarding doesnt work with a standard install unless you take down the SPI feature of the router, making it less secure. The fancy lighting is useless and has no functionality other than to fire off blue light. Fortunately this can be turned off.If laptop is put in sleep mode, it has a VERY difficult time reconnecting, sometimes having to reboot in order to get a clean connection. Signal strength also seems to be less than advertised but this may be the reason it was a refurb. I think there are better routers for the money. I wont go with netgear again."
1,Poor wireless range,"I currently have a Dell TrueMobile 2300 and was not satisfied with its range. The PC in my attic (has TrueMobile 1300 adaptor and runs Windows 2000) had a weak (6-12Mbps) connection to the router in my office and I was getting lots of flack from the family about how slow it was (hence they always want to use my computer).The Netgear WPN824 sounded like a great solution given its promise of much better range. I installed the new router on my main computer and that went okay. I configured the wireless connection as I had it for my TrueMobile. However, when I went to the attic to see how it would work with my PC, the network was not even visible (four from my neighbors were). After spending a few hours pouring over documents and website postings, I gave up and reconnected my TrueMobile (thankfully it still worked!). The Netgear is going back.It looks like I'll have to wait for 802.11m. Hopefully, the gear heads will agree on a standard soon so the products can flow."
2,not impressed,"i thought this was supposed to be better than it is. no major problems. but, stupid blinking light is annoying as he** and the strength is not great for me (apartment building - 55 units). It is slower than my land connection was when 2 people are using. it's ok - just not what i expected."
3,Not Much of An Improvement Over 54G,"I have done approximaetly three (3) wireless routers since I have been a broadband man. All three of them were Netgear Routers. They have performed adequately, although none of them have done what they purport to do (eliminate dead spots, increase range, etc.)This rangemax is no different. It did not eliminate the dead spots I was getting with my 54G Wireless Router. That is not to say that it isn't a decent router; it handles my family's usage well enough. It just doesn't do anything special.The blue lights were not irritating me as much as the fact that I thought this router was overhyped.Tech Dude"
3,"So So story telling, good story","The subject was very interesting and it will probably be made into a good crime movie, but the writing was average and the plotline jumbled...."
5,Fascinating,"This is an extremely entertaining and informative look at the world of art theft, which if you're like me isn't what you thought it was. I enjoyed this book a great deal."
4,Clear easy read,"This is worth reading. It is clearly written and flows easily through the chapters. It has some repetition in it, so the major points could have been condensed. But overall I'd recommend it. I can't say it improved my golf game yet as I think this would take some soaking in of the techniques."
5,Great book!,My 21 month old loves this book and has to read it every night. It's a great learning book. It's helping him learn to count and all the animals.
4,Great Book!,The duck stays stuck deep in the muck. Will the animals get duck out of the muck? The squishy squishy muck. Read to find out if there is good news for duck. Brandon H.
5,Great for language development,"I use this book as a speech therapist with toddlers. I simplify the text slightly and it is great for prediction, auditory memory, and word final k stimulation. Once they are familiar with it, I encourage the child to ""help"" me with the repetitive chorus. As a bonus it is simply a really fun and cute book."
5,How the Animals Help,"I wish I could write to the publisher of the first review when he talks about not understanding how the animals help.At the beginning of the book you will see a stick with a red leaf in the water.The Two Fish ""Splish"" this stick closer to land...and it just continues from there. All the animals use something in some way to move the stick closer and closer to the duck until...""Spluck!"" His other foot is on it and he uses it for leverage to get out. It great to see how the kids get excited the closer the stick comes to the duck.Just something new to point out to your young ones!!Debbie"
1,Not as Cute as I thought,"Really not worth it. It's awkward and uninspired. The animal sounds and actions are garbled into one word where you don't really know what it means, for example, ""four crickets pleep to the duck"" and you're left not knowing if pleeping is really helpful for a duck or what the heck pleep even means. Is it an animal sound or is it a verb?""Ten Little Ladybugs"" is much more cute. The tempo is fun and the actions of the various animals are clear and captivating (at least as captivating as a book at this level would be)."
4,Kids liked it..,"I bought this CD for only one song, the ""Donkey Song"". My kids heard it on kids radio. They loved the song. We have not heard the rest of the CD. Since we could not find the song anywhere else, it was worth it to buy the whole CD for just one song."
4,Good Songs but they have so much more,"THe Sylvers were more than the Bubble Gum Material that Eventually made there later work.Leon Sylver is Tight Producer&He went on to Produce alot of Good Records.this Group never got that Push.there songs for the time were fun ""Hot Line"" etc... but there was more to this Act than that.still cool to reflect."
4,Disturbing true story,"This is the ghastly true story of a psychopath loose in the medical system. Read it for a glimpse into the criminal mind, but more importantly read it for a grasp of the medical system that has only self-imposed controls. It's a damning report of a system in which I am involved."
4,SERIAL KILLER DOCTOR...!!!!,"THIS BOOK IS A GREAT POWER PACKED STORY OF HOW A SERIAL KILLER DOCTOR COULD GET AWAY WITH HIS MURDERS FOR SO LONG, AND BE COVERED UP BY THE ""DOCTORS PROFESSIONAL PROTECT EACH OTHER RULES"" AGAIN AND AGAIN. IT IS VERY SCARY HOW U CAN NOT EVEN TRUST A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL WHEN IN THE HOSPITAL. IT CERTAINLY WILL MAKE ME QUESTION ANYTHING I AM GIVEN OR INJECTED WITH NEXT TIME I AM IN THE HOSPITAL. A MUST READ IF U HAVE WONDERED HOW MEDICAL ""ACCIDENTS"" HAPPEN!!"
2,"Compelling story, but banal writing and factual errors","The story of Michael Swango is inherently interesting, but the author does not do it justice. His writing is repetitive and banal (at perhaps a sixth grade level). He re-uses the same adverbs and adjectives to a distracting degree (just try to count how many times he uses the word ""handsome"" or reports that people felt ""faint""). The last chapter, dealing with serial murder among health care professionals and the National Practitioner Data Bank, has numerous serious errors that that the lay reader (and professionals reviewers) would not be able to detect. But, having done research and writing in these areas, I know that they are whoppers."
3,"good story, mediocre writing and organization","While the story is interesting and important, I was not impressed with the book. I was fascinated with the story after reading about it in the New Yorker article Stewart wrote in 1997. The book seems like it may have been done in a rush. I expect more from someone who has won a Pulitzer Prize. I would be interested in reading a more thoughtful, better organized, and better written treatment of this incredible and disturbing story."
1,Is this a script for Phil Donahue or Jerry Springer?,"This is another example of the media's biased doctor bashing. Swango is a bad apple. He is a rarity. To give the most extreme example of a problem to demonstrate how a whole system is broken is absurd. Doctors don't cover for doctors. They are often each other's worst critics. Meaningful regulation is often limited or blocked by litigation, whether threatened or real. At my hospital we have a bad surgeon we would like to remove from the staff (multiple malpractice cases among other problems), but their lawyer keeps appealing so we are forced to allow them to practice while we wait. Stewart misses the point that lawyers make it very difficult for doctors to police themselves."
5,"Excellent read, excellent condition. Brand new.",Have always been looking for this book. Finally found it. Bought it. Read it. Enjoyed it. Nothing went wrong. Shipment came early.
4,What a fun read!,"Nicely done. A very cool, tongue-in-cheek, send up of the television industry wrapped in a murder mystery. Loved the thinly veiled characters that Mr. Goldberg salts the book with - especially Esther Radcliffe.A fun read, a worthy read. Don't miss out on this one. And check out the sequel, ""Beyond the Beyond""."
1,Don't bother,"I ""bought"" this book when it was free and I overpaid. I've read others by this author that while not fabulous, were entertaining. This was AWFUL. I really wonder now why I finished it. The characters are all caricatures (Mostly of horny stupid men) and as a reader I didn't care if any of them lived or died. The whole plot centered around television shows and ratings and really, who cares? My recommendation is: don't waste your time on this."
3,Has Its Moments,"One of the editorial reviews above mentioned Carl Hiaasen, and I think that is apt. Like Hiassen, the plot is strained, most of the developments are telegraphed way in advance, and the ""funny situations"" are pretty predictable. But, sometimes a particular scene really takes off, and sometimes you read a throwaway line or a bit of dialogue that really hits the mark. That keeps the book going, makes the read worthwhile, and is its own reward."
3,Beware early copies,"This game is really fun, if you like the Jak games, Mario Kart, or Twisted Metal. But be careful the earlier black labels have a save game glitch, if you want to know more look up jak X on wikipedia. I'd suggest buying the red labels."
4,Not Too Difficult,This game is fun but repetitive. Fortunately it is not too difficult so younger kids can play without getting frustrated.
2,"Why, Naughty Dog? What did I ever do to you???","Jak & Daxter. This once-crap-then-excellent-then-crap-again series has been really on and off. The best moments of Jak were Jak II and Jak 3 while the bad were Precursor Legasy and of course: THIS BALL OF $%&#%#&$%&#$%$&#&$&#&$&#&%$&#$&$%&# MESS!!! The first three games in the series may have had vehicles in it (some even HAD racing) but turning it into a whole game is just ridiculus. THe graphics are nothing compared to Jak 3 and the sound is really crappy. There are new characters but all of them feel rushed and badly designed. There is an tired old gay racer called... Razer, and he speaks with the gayest accent I have EVER heard. He also looks gay and he smokes cigarettes AND looks gay while doing it. This is the gayest racing game EVER!!! The only point in buying this game is that Ratchet is in it just like another reviewer said.Jak X scores: 3/10Rent it if you are a die hard Jak fan. Otherwise, leave it!"
1,Very disappointed,"I thought this DVD would be such a bargain with 5 different workouts. I was disappointed with all of these workouts. The first workout started fine then he got really complex. Why do they feel it's necessary to make thins so hard and frustrating, it's a total turnoff. The rest of workouts were not challenging at all. I was very disappointed in this. I might give it another try only because I don't want it to be a waste of money."
2,Too much advertising / too little sweating,"I don't like the fact that there is so much advertising for the brand of water they use in each of the workouts - it's pretty annoying. In one of the workouts, they actually take a break of several minutes while the instructor talks about how great this water is.I also felt that the workouts were more on the low impact side, and I didn't get that great of a workout from them. With most of them, I barely break a sweat. Also, some of the workouts spend too much time teaching the routines and then breaking in between - which amounts to too much down time for me.I might use this for a light workout or for days when I don't really feel like exercising, but it certainly won't be a regular for me."
3,Tiny!,"I must say that I would give the delivery 5 stars I ord'd this book as well as the Aromatherapy titled book of the same publisher on Dec. 3rd and rec'd Dec. 4th and I did not choose overnight shipping....but I guess everyone has their ""A"" game on due to the holiday season! However, the reason for three stars is because the books are extremely small...they measure approx 4 3/8"" x 5 3/8"" - and as far as I could tell nothing in the books description made that clear. I am going to keep them bcse the information does look helpful, but I would have preferred a larger regular sized book...especially when using for educational purposes."
3,Mysore Sandlewood Soap,"Although I love the smell of sandalwood, this soap's aroma has an all too familiar sent.It smells just like my dog's flea shampoo. No kidding.Oh well maybe it'll keep the fleas off me anyway???"
1,This is a one page rip- off and not good information,This is a one page rip- off and not good information. I was expecting an e-book. I want my money back.
3,Difficult to read,"This book is chock full of information about myth and fantasy; however, you have to wade through the Tolkeinese form of writing to decipher the meanings. It's not all it's cracked-up to be...beginning writers take note...it's not going to give you much insight or instruction on writing fantasy and myth. Actually, as I've long suspected, writing in these genres is mostly what's in your head. Sometimes other writers will inspire you in one direction or another, but I don't think this book will. It's full of description but not much else. Seems to be trying to pin-down the ""real"" meaning of myth and, as we all know, it's a slippery area with a myriad of meanings. (Like beauty's in the eye of the beholder.)"
2,Well written but unappealing content,I read the book that took place at the lumber mill. I picked the book up because it was supposed to be funny. I don't find child maltreatment entertaining. If you are a reader interested in an adventure story about orphans I would highly recommend Homecoming by Cynthia Voight. It's wonderful.
1,The author does not quite understand the text itself,"The author does not quite undertand the text itself and comes through as being very biased. The author has wasted her efforts to put through incorrect views of her own, much better if she had researched some other texts perhaps the bible? However, knowing her knack for misinterpreting ancient texts I shudder to even think about it.In ending I think anyone who commented the following on the most sacred Indian text as follows should not have tried interpreting a religious text of the relgion that she is biased against:The Bhagavad Gita is not as nice a book as some Americans think,"" the good professor informed her audience. ""Throughout the Mahabharata ... Krishna goads human beings into all sorts of murderous and self-destructive behaviours such as war.... The Gita is a dishonest book ; it justifies war."" Prof. Doniger added for good measure : ""I'm a pacifist. I don't believe in `good' wars."" (Philadelphia Inquirer of 19 November.)"
1,Piece of junk!,We ordered these necklaces for my boys Christmas stockings. Within one wearing the first of the two necklaces broke. The very first time my son took the necklace off it came detached from the metal clapse. The other one we order is greatly fraying at the clapse and it has only been 2 weeks. I'm sure it will not make it a month! We have ordered other titanium necklaces and have never had this kind of problem!
3,Very Poor Shipping,"While the product is fine, just what I expected at a good price, the shipping was atrocious. According to Amazon, the item shipped on Dec. 23 except the USPS Tracking indicated that the item didn't get into their system until Dec. 31 and while Amazon said it would be delivered by Dec. 31, didn't receive the item until Jan. 5 almost two weeks and it doesn't take 2 weeks to ship anything in the US. I blame Amazon who really took over a week to ship something that was in stock. Will make me think twice before ever ordering from Amazon again if I need the item in a reasonable period of time."
1,Lasted 2 weeks,"My brush head stopped working after only 2 weeks. To be fair, I haven't contacted Amazon yet to see if they will replace it."
5,Good Heads for Small Mouths,"Before using Sonicare, I used a regular toothbrush. Unfortunately, it was hard to get the large head of a traditional brush towards the back of my mouth. My dental hygenist noticed heavy plaque back there and planned to use local anesthetic at my next appointment in order to perform a proper prophylaxis. I just was not cleaning my back teeth well enough!She also recommended I buy the Sonicare toothbrush with the Ultra Compact Brush Heads. With it, I can now easily brush the back of my mouth. At my next appointment, my hygenist decided I no longer needed the anesthetic, because my back teeth required little prophylactic cleaning.If you brush your teeth twice per day with the Sonicare, you definitely need to replace the brush head after six months, just as the instructions say. They do not wear out the same as a regular toothbrush, but you can tell the difference near the end of the sixth month when your teeth do not feel as clean as they should."
3,Sonicare surprise,I was surprised that the brushes on these Sonicare heads were so small. I had been unaware brush heads this small even existed.I found the small heads very effective in reaching hard to brush areas of my mouth. I felt that the shipping was slow and disproportionately expensive.In the future I will be more cautious in what I order and how.
5,Just fine,"It's hard to find these compact heads in the local stores anymore. They make it easier to get to the back teeth in a smaller mouth. No complaints, they do what they're supposed to do."
4,The book on movement training,"As its title states, it is THE ""Guide to Movement performance"". Although it is a comprehensive guide on climbing training, its worth is found on the foundations of climbing technique (movement, positioning, etc ...). The authors formulate the very (few) principles of technique and their training through beautiful and comprehensive images and movies. This systematic approach enables the understanding of any move by reducing them to a combination of the basic principles.The other parts of the book concentrate on the physical and psychological aspects of climbing. Although its principles are also shown, the practical application of these principles were, in my opinion, vague in comparison to the technique part. These sections are still worth reading, but I think ""Training for Climbing"" contains a richer and more practical approach to physical and psychological training."
4,great for climbers with little experience,if you have climbed for a couple of months and want to1) understand better techniques and movements2) improve your style3) become more aware while climbing and watching others climbthen this is a good starting point
4,"good, solid information",i'm a new climber but this book is well written and easy to understand. lots of terminology and techniques to help any climber improve. has lots of diagrams that are easy to follow.
3,It is what it is...,"I purchased the Fishing Buddy 2202 on a whim. I'm more of a river fly fisherman, but my grandson wanted to go out in my dad's boat, so I thought I would help locate fish. It did once I figured out how to operate the thing. I've used it ice fishing a couple times, and it does OK, I've had as good luck as anglers using $500 Vexlar units. If I was really a meat fisherman I would invest in a higher precision unit...but for what it is and for what I use it for, works fine."
4,Anatolian Tales,"Yasar Kemal is one of the best Turkish novel writers. Perhaps he is the most known writer around Europe as a Turkish writer. Anatolian Tales is Yasar Kemal's one of the best books. In this book there are three stories which are written in an interesting way.These three stories passes around the main land of Turkey in Anatolia. They are tales. There are some writings explaining the tradition in the time of Ottoman Empire in Anatolia. I think this book is a ""must read"" for Turkish people and all others who are interested in beautiful lands of Anatolia..."
4,All the other reviews are for the old book,I wasnt going to buy this book because of the poor reviews. But then I got looking and its published in Sept. 2007 and all the reviews are way before that. So I went to B&N and actually previewed the book and ended up buying it. I'm impressed with parts of the book. He explains a lot about the PIC and covers the difference for most pics. It really ties up a lot of loose ends that I had. The beginner may have not understand everything but the more experinced person will understand completely. The part I didn't like was the Microchip website stuff but here again maybe some people dont surf the net and figure out alot of this stuff themselves. Buy the book if you want the details explained and already have a basic understanding.
1,Very Poor. Assumed reader understood microprocessors.,This book was purchased to help understand how to program the PIC micro. It was as bad as the PIC literature. It was written at a level that assumed the user was familiar with microprocessors and jumped right into a rehash of the convoluted PIC literature. Needless to say it was simply another book that got relegated to the library shelf. I don't recommend anyone buy this book if you are trying to learn anything about the PIC. The problem is mainly that professors should not be writing books for ordinary engineers to read. I was looking for a book that outlined in simple language how to use the PIC. This book was an absolute disappointment. This would be a book I would ask to have my money refunded.
1,Same old same old,"This is one for Rooneyphiles - more of the same old shtick. The author has made a name for himself by being cranky and he does it again. The enduring trouble with Rooney's pointy opinions is that, in the end, he doesn't really take a stand on anything of note, so you reach the end of his thoughts feeling deflated. Nothing here to trouble the advertisers, which, come to think of it, describes his job on CBS to a tee."
3,Just OK,"For some reason, I thought that this would be a sturdier table. It is not particularly stable and not that attractive. Any bump sends glasses and dinnerware flying. I paid in the mid thirty dollar range for it, and with shipping it wound up being a 50$ item. Problem is; it is not worth 50$. I could have gone to any local hardware store and gotten this size and quality of table for less. I felt pretty stupid after seeing it was just a cheezy, white plastic table. As with any item, one should calculate shipping prior to clicking the buy button. Think before you click"
5,Great fun,"This is a gossipy, entertaining book about what really happens with a pro football team. I'm a 49er fan, but I think even those who are fans of other teams would love the inside stuff in this book. The chapter about Eddie DeBartolo's rollicking ride through Las Vegas is a classic, and I got a totally different view of Eddie D after reading about all his conflicts with Bill Walsh, Carmen Policy and his sister. Great fun."
3,"Great on 52"" Screen","Always wanted a large aquarium but with cats and kids it wasn't going to happen. The picture quality is great on HDMI big screen and we can have our own music on in the background. The BEST thing about this video, is playing it for real estate showings now that we listed our home for sale. Bad housing market, but a fun video for staging atmosphere!"
3,Look and Feel was off,"Obviously a first-class production, but alot of aspects I just hated in terms of ""look and feel.""Third-person felt awkward as the guy's body takes up most of the screen. First person also felt awkward because you couldn't see the gun.Targeting system felt overdone and awkward. Too much red/green crap on your screen, you can't really see anything, in the middle of a firefight you see red crap all over your screen, too much ""computerized"" combat not enough about the art of good tactical soldiering.Picking teammates was another stupid aspect.You can't choose sniper without losing medic. You can't choose rocket launcher guy without losing your machine gun guy.If you have great interest in this game I highly recommend you choose R6 Vegas 1 and 2, as those were simply better in every way."
2,A disgrace to the Clancy games,"This game is terrible. The controls are counterintuitive and inconsistent. the motion (specifically of aiming) is very sluggish and frustrating. Also, the campaign has way too much talking and extra little things going on. If you want a sweet Clancy combat game, go for Rainbow Six Vegas. It is fifty times better."
3,Good - if you didn't pay full price,"My 10 cents short and dense: Just like many others have commented, I find the game play is a little too short and it's annoying when your player automatically take cover. I paid $19.99 and I think that's value for money, but I wouldn't have paid more. Others have recommended Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Las Vegas - I will probably buy that."
2,great expectations,"Lost my 2001 copy to fire. Replaced with RH-2nd ed., unabridge w/cd-rom. Good price. Worthless quality control. Improved binding, sleeves, cover, yes; distorted master-copy causes blotchy impressionistic print. Embedded format is caustically distorted; stronger, bolder some pages; flaky light, unreadable on others.Several copies ordered/sent back (3 printings), all failed in the same locations and pages. Irritating to a fault. I like the Oxford(NOAD); every page elementally identical to the 1st page through 2076. Cost:$65.00. In fact, every dictionary I own (12) are perfect, beginning to end. Random House is facetting a flawed master copy. No quality control. Heaven help me...."
1,Old Edition Advertised as a New Release,"The web site said you were taking advance orders for the book, so I assumed it was a new edition. It was the very old one reissued.Your return service, however, was excellent, even though I had of course opened the package, finding out it was not a new edition."
4,Great mixer,"We've had this mixer for several years now. Works great for mixing cakes, pies and cookies. Also mashes potatoes very well. I like the ability to use it as a hand and stand mixer. Great versatility.Only reason for 4 stars is it has a short cord. Manufacturer claims for safety reasons. Unplugs if falls, etc."
3,Wanted more...,"Ever wanted to know what you would do if you had to go back in time and be/act like a slave? This story gives you a good headstart. This was a good story, however I wanted more. More what? Brutality, blood, angst... something!I read 'Fledging' first and was OVERWHELMED with how good that one was, so I guess I just wanted what that book had."
5,"Shelved as Fantasy, but it ain't","Too bad this spectacular book is usually shelved in the Fantasy section. It doesn't belong there, as it's much more appropriate in the American History section. Yeah, the premise is fantasy: a young African American woman, Dana, is transported from present-day California into the brutal life of slave culture in Maryland, 1819. Forget trying to figure things out; that's not important. What's so valuable about this book is the suspense of Dana's situation, how she will deal with her new life on a southern plantation where she counts for almost nothing, and the generous and historically accurate sprinkling of details of plantation life that are strewn liberally throughout.Excellent."
3,Draws you in and spits you out.,"Since I had to read this book for a class, I wasn't altogether excited about beginning it. Still, it grabbed my attention from the first page--Butler definitely has the ability to get a reader interested! As the book progressed, however, I got increasingly annoyed with the characters--ALL the characters. I was frustrated that none of them seemed capable of positive development and just wanted to yell at them. The reading was enjoyable to begin with, but unsatisfying in the end."
5,I'm in love with Octavia Butler!,"What a thought provoking book.From the beginning till the end, this story fascinated me, kept me thinking about the world today.I've always wondered why people in general let things happen to them...like slavery. Why did the enslaved people not stand up their enslavers?. This story gave me the answer dead on. Before you know it you adjust to your situation. You become a product of your environment, slaves and enslavers alike.This book is a must read!!The world lost a great treasure with Ms Butler's dead..."
5,"Fantastic Author, Intriguing Story","After reading Butler's ""Lilith's Brood"" (1st book I'd read by her) and liking it so well, I didn't figure the author could write another winner. But, she did. ""Kindred"" is the 2nd book I've read by this author. She has impressed me enough with her transparent writing and great imagery in both books that I'm anxious to read other books by her now. ""Kindred"" is really a historical fiction book with just a touch of SciFi via time-travel. I'm a historical fiction nut, so that worked out fine for me."
5,Butler Offers a Uniue Perspective,"When I was assigned to read Octavia Butler's ""Kindred"" for my American Literature class last year, I thought it would be just like every other book that I had ever be assigned to read for school - boring. However, once I started reading, I came to realize that this book was different. I just couldn't put it down - I think I read the entire novel in two nights! Butler's vivid descriptions and constantly changing scenery provides the reader with a literary experience unlike any other. Although this was the first novel by Butler that I had ever read, I look forward to reading many of her other books in the months to come. If you have time to read one book this summer, I implore you to read ""Kindred"" - it will be time well spent."
5,Wow.,"Wow. Buy it, read it, learn from it. Science fiction has a whole new meaning for me. RIP Ms. Butler."
3,Kindred,"It was great for the first third, but it got redundant and dull as it went on. Good premise, just not consistently interesting."
4,One of the best!,Loved the Peyton Manning sports segment. Also loved the Tony Bennett skit with Alec Baldwin. Buy it!!
5,Great product!,This is definitely worth the $20 I paid and worked like an expensive model. The texture of the ice is fine and soft just as you would get at a shaved ice stand. I'm glad I checked the Amazon reviews before purchasing it. Other people say a negative to this product is the limited quantities you can make with just the two ice molds that come with it. All you need to do is to put the frozen discs in a ziploc bag and keep making more so you have a lot on hand.
5,"Great fun, great price!","I think not much needs to be said about this simple machine other than it works exactly how it should. It's easy to use, and easy to keep clean. The two ice molds that it comes with are perfect, and the ice shaves really well. We got this as a staff 'perk', and everybody is loving it, especially now that summer is here. I highly recommend it!"
2,A lot of work,It takes quite a while to make just 4 snow cones. You need to put a lot of pressure on the top in order to get shaved ice to come out.
5,Turns ice into powdery snow inexpensively,"I love this ice shaver.I've used mine way more than 200 times over the last 3 years. Just had the blade professionally sharpened for the first time. Looked it up on Amazon because I'm concerned about its eventual demise. What would replace it? Very happy it's still available. Naturally, I'll just buy another. But for the present, the motor is still going strong.On the other hand, what if it lasts another 10 years? Hamilton Beach better not discontinue it. Maybe I should just buy another one now. I'll think about it.I suggest any of the Torani fruit-flavored syrups -- and especially their ""orgeat"" (almond flavored) -- with a lot of fresh lemon juice on top, in a giant, clear glass mug. Hold it by the handle so your body heat doesn't rush melting. The colder and harder your ice is to start with, the better your final product will be.I've gotten a lot of enjoyment out of this machine. A pleasure to tell you about it."
5,Exceeded my expectations!,"Tho, this item has a lotta great reviews, I was still somewhat skeptical about how well it would work. The results went beyond what I was hoping for! It's quick and effiecient ice shaving, just over sixty seconds is what it took for me to put together a nice refreshing treat. And the sound was no louder than that of a blender or cake mixer. I don't use it as often, nor do I expect it to last me forever, but at the price I got it for, I think it's a fair exchange."
4,Satisfied!,I am very happy with this ice shaver.My only minor complaint would be it doesn't shave regular ice cubes as well as the provided ice mold. It should include 4 molds instead of 2.
4,This is what I needed!,"I wanted something to crush ice so that I could make home made smoothies by freezing Crystal Light drink mix and crushing it into ice crystals to mix with sugar free yogurt, etc for a light, low calorie confection. I had bought another machine that promised to crush ice and it did not do the job, so when I read the reviews on this one, I decided to give it a try. It's great. I don't even need to use a hand held blender. I just freeze the Crystal Light in the little plastic molds that come with the machine and then use as directed to get shaved ice in a matter of minutes. Then I stir in the yogurt, a tiny bit of liquid (juice or whatever) and I'm good to go! It's easy to clean and I just store it away in the cupboard."
2,Returned Item - Shaved Iced Too Finely,"I had to return this item because my impression was that the ice was going to be thicker and more ""slushy"" similar to the ice that you're used to when you have a snow cone and this machine is supposed to allow you to make snow cones. The shaved ice is very thin and so fine that it melts so fast and becomes water before you can enjoy it with anything. I wanted to use the shaved ice to eat with fruit or make a dessert but by the time I mixed the ice with my fruit it was already melted and just left me with fruit soaked in water. I'm not sure how you would be able to mix the ice with syrup to even make a snow cone? This item does have a great blade to shave your ice but it is way too fine and should be more slushy (the ice does not come out to look like the image on the box at all). I was very disappointed!"
2,"Cute, but not made for walking","I love these shoes, in theory. In practice, they are pretty darned uncomfortable. Couldn't recommend them, but I doubt they're still around at this point anyway."
1,It is terrible.,"Graphics stink, controls are soooooo hard to remember and they're wierd. It is so boring get call of duty or god of war!!"
5,How does it feel to have breast cancer at a young age!,"My daughter had breast cancer in her thirties and now has a recurrence. She talks a lot with her cancer support group, but her family and friends often find it difficult to talk with her about what she is going through (since we don't really know what she is going through). This book is great as it details four friends who each get a breast cancer diagnosis at a young age. As they talk about their experiences, I recognize items my daughter told me, but I didn't really ""get it"". Reading this book you begin to understand. These are young women with a child, with husbands, with a wedding date, and with hopes and dreams for the future. Cancer casts a shadow over all these plans. Warning: reading certain chapters made me cry. But it is an excellent book especially if you have a friend or family member with cancer."
3,Be A Leader,"Palmer was in many different situations but always had an idea to get him out of it. For example, in one part of the book Nipper, Palmer's pet pigeon, lands right on his head! To top it off it's in front of the ""guys"". Palmer's reaction to this situation was to act like the bird was not his. Some events were predictable and some were unbelievable. All of the unbelievable events added up to an even more unbelievable ending. Thought out the story Palmer turns from a follower to a leader. This is also the theme of the book: Be a leader not a follower. We thought this book was okay in some parts but way to unbelievable in others. We would recommend this book to kids in fourth through sixth grade rather than seventh to eighth."
5,Wringer the Unique,"Another unique thing that Jerry Spinelli specializes in is the way the characters make cover-ups. An example is when Palmer is trying to stay after school because he doesn't want Nipper to land on his head and the guys wring Nipper. What he did was he tickled his teacher on the last week of school. The teacher bellowed, ""Palmer! What has gotten into you?"" Palmer then shouted, ""PUBERTY!"" That got Palmer to stay after school for the whole week."
4,very good book,this is a book for all ages not just kids. it keeps you in supsense wonder whast gone to happen to nipper. palmer is a very likable chacter and we all probly know a kid like beans. i recomend this to anybody that like aniaml frediships stories.
5,""" Wringer "" - It's the Best!","Wringer is a great book! Jerry Spinelli is a great author. Wringer is about a boy named Palmer who doesn't want to be a wringer. A wringer is someone who ""wrings"" the necks of pigeons at Family Fest. His friends, Beans and Mutto, want to be wringers. Later Palmer gets a pigeon named Nipper and tries to hide him from the town because the town hates pigeons.I would recommend this book to someone else because it is a great book. I think anyone could read it. I like Wringer because of the characters.(...)Wringer is a great book!"
5,Not All Birthdays are Welcome,"Wringer is about a boy named Palmer. He is in a gang. Every one in his gang wants to become a wringer. Palmer is different. One day a pigeon shows up at his window. Nipper. When Palmer turns ten, he will have to choose if he will become a wringer or not. This could be the biggest thing in his life. This is a great book, you should read it. Read through all of Palmer's adventures!!!By Sbspack"
3,Wringer,"Wringer was a satisfying book. I expected this book to be great, but it let me down. I expected a lot more from Jerry Spinelli. Wringer was a Newbery Honor book.First the book started off as a little boy named Palmer LaRue. It was Palmer's ninth birthday and the neighborhood gang came. They gave Palmer really selfish gifts. When they were done they went outside and played with Palmer's new soccer ball. That was the first time Palmer played with the guys. The only thing was the guys were tough and Palmer was not. Palmer doesn't want to be a wringer when he turns ten, everyone else does.What happens to Palmer? Does he be a wringer? Read the book to find out.-Haley"
2,Wierd Book,"This book was okay. Very weird, though, and not one of the best books I have read. I was not that impressed by the actions of the gang, a group Palmer decided to hang out with. I was much more interested in the part about the bird. Also, for the part about shooting the pigeons, it was very cruel. I know the author showed how Palmer chose the birds side, but still, the contents are cruel. It is an okay book, I guess, but I wouldn't recamend rushing out to buy it."
3,OK... but not my favorite book!,I am not a fan of pigeons but I don't like the way the author describes killing them like it's a game!
5,Creepy cool!,"this book is so cool!..and so creepy! A must read!... I havent got to finish it because ive only read the back synaposis and alittle bit of the book itself....its just so creepy cool. (sorry, I cant explain)"
5,A Child Finds Compassion and Sensitivity To Animals,"The boy in the story has to confront the prevailing contempt for animals and the disregard of animal suffering in his community. He is indifferent at first, and then as he begins to care for and love one of the animals, he realizes he must protect his own animal from abuse. He is afraid to take a stand in the beginning, but his love makes him courageous. He realizes that he does not have to go along with the abuse of the animals, just because others feel the animals don't deserve respect and kindness. He finds the strength to stand up for what is right. This is a beautiful story for both children and adults about standing up for what is right and resisting wrong."
1,Unbelievably unsafe!!!,"Unlike a drill, circular saw, etc, that uses a ""trigger"" mechanism to start it, the Rotozip uses a ""pull switch"" on the back of the unit. A trigger would allow the unit to stop automatically if you lost control and dropped it. However, Rotozip's pull switch makes you pull on it to start, then push it to stop. There's no safety mechanism to shut it off if you lose control. That means if you drop it while using it, you'd better get out of the way quick or expect to get a severe injury.In addition, I've had my Rotozip for about a year and use it only occasionally because of its hazards. While using it recently, much to my horror I discovered that the pull switch failed altogether! The only way I could stop it was to very carefully kick the extension cord out of the outlet! Considering I was using a circular diamond blade at the time, this was very dangerous indeed! How did this thing get to the market?DO NOT BUY THE ROTOZIP!!! IT'S TOO UNSAFE!!!"
1,Nice Light the runs very hot,"This is a nice idea with an emergency light that has a has a battery charger. The light is hot to the touch, most unusual for an LED light. Great Idea but bad implementation. Because of the heat generated, I have unplugged mine. If not for the excessive heat generated while plugged in, I would have rated it a 5 star product."
3,Sound advice for providing leadership and communication,"Awesome book about managing others. He is really dealing with leadership not management per se; the leadership and communication chapters were a great asset. Rock solid advice about you having to activily listen to the ones you manage. The case history examples were helpful, though I wish the author would have provided more advice how to do it better and continually improve yourself. Good for people who want to jump into the management world."
5,west bend automatic egg cooker,"Haved used this egg poacher every week since buying it,it sets on my kitchen cabinet ,so easy to use and does a good job. No more greasy eggsthanks west bend and amazon"
1,west bend egg cooker,"worst egg cooker on the market, shut off thermostat is higher than the rest of the reservoir, it sets off the alarm with a tablespoon of water still in it and the eggs are still raw!!"
1,West Bend Automatic Egg Cooker a Flop,"This Item has some definite problems, along with the company. I used only less than one half of the water in the manual to poach or soft boil eggs. They still came out hard boiled. The tempeture sensor or the heating plate are not calabrated correctly. I emailed the company over a week ago, and have received zero response. The premise sounded very good when I heard this rated on ""Cooks Country"" as the best tested. They must have received a good one, and did not have to contact customer service. Another device for the trash bin."
5,Wonderful wonderful,"The West Ben egg cooker is wonderful. It cooks soft boiled, hard boiled and poached eggs to perfection. My only regret is that it took me so long to find it."
3,Handle broke after 2 years,"I purchased this cooker about two years ago and had excellant success with boiled eggs. As some reviewers have indicated, the poaching cups are small and need medium size eggs in order to keep the eggs from oozing out of the holder.Today the handle broke during the cooking process and the water leaked onto my counter top. The replacement cost through West Bend for the egg holder, plus the shipping charges, makes it cheaper for me to buy another new cooker.I will try another brand this time because there is a problem with the handles on this brand."
3,"Simple, effective but...","This was a change from a previous egg cooker--works much the same way but its timing is a bit off, overcooking my eggs ever the slightest bit, which for a soft-boiled egg is important. It works, just not as mindlessly as I had hoped."
1,Piece of Junk,"I purchased this because Cooks Illustrated gave it such a good review. What a disappointment. I have absolutely nothing positive to say. The water measuring cup was mislabeled. One side should have been marked for soft cooked eggs, but they were both labeled ""Hard Cooked."" The increments are backwards. For example, if you want to cook one egg, you fill it to the 7 mark and if you want to cook 7 eggs you fill it to the 1 mark. Anything in between is a crap shoot. The individual poached egg cups are too small and an egg will overflow and make a huge mess. And in addition to all this, the unit simply DID NOT work. Within a couple seconds of starting the cooker the buzzer started going off. Nothing I did would stop the buzzer if it was plugged in. I finally gave up, cleaned up the unit, packed it up, and returned it to Amazon. Thank goodness Amazon makes returns easy. Huge disappointment. Not one good thing to say about it. Solid junk. They owe me for the four eggs I wasted."
4,"Excellent product, hard to store","This item works great, cooks eggs wonderfully. The only problem I had with this item is the top doesn't sit securely in the cupboard and tends to slide off. It has never slid off while cooking an egg, but storing it can be a pain if you don't have a lot of storage space."
4,Easy way to fix eggs,Have had a West Bend egg cooker for several years. Needed one for our second home because got tired of transporting our original unit or hardboiling the old fashion way and poaching eggs without a unit like this is very difficult. Every home should have one.
5,Best Book On The Mental Aspect of Sport,I have been studying the mental aspect of sports for about a year now. I have probably read 20 books on the subject. This is the best.I am a marginal baseball fan. The info here is transferable to any sport.
1,Not happy!,"I am going back to my old machine. I was unhappy when I opened this coffeemaker as the clock feature was important to me. This clock is not illuminated and is angled in a way that you can't see it across the room even in light. I decided to try the coffeemaker anyway in my quest for better coffee. I have tried it both with the Flavor+ brew on and off and am dissapointed with the coffee both ways. And the carafe did drip on me, something I never had to worry about before. I am very sorry I wasted my money on this."
5,Great belt great price!,I ordered it for my mother in law-so far all the belts I bought her needed more wholes added and never fitted her well-this one with so many wholes not only fits her well with everything she decides to wear it but also holds everything in place because its wide and has two buckles and wholes to hold it in place. Also the seller send me the wrong belt-instead of leather it was canvas but once I notified them they sent me the right one and refunded me for the return shipping on the wrong one. Great belt overall well worth the money.
3,big book of things that go,a few irreparable tears in the book but it's to be expected for a used book. satisfird with speed of arrival. thanks.
3,My First Jumbo Book of Things That Go,Nice book with lots of things to do. I bought this book because we had the Dinosaur book from this series. I was a little disappointed because the Dinosaur book was much superior. I expected more.
5,Dynasty : The brightest in SOLAR,"From pure funk to ballad, from dance to romance--Leon Sylvers & Dynasty are one of the best ever !If you like a heavy funky Bass, a lighting lead guitar and fantastic vocals--This group is the best from the 1980 west coast funk genre !"
3,From Vines to Wines,"I found that Jeff Cox's book to be an excellent ""short"" guide for growing grapes and making wine. The book is targeted towards the backyard gardener and hobbyist. His examples of trellis construction is excellent with its illustrations of construction techniques. The section on disease and pest would have benefited by including color photos. I would recommend that this book for anyone that is interested in starting a small (less then 200 vines) vineyard."
4,hand blender,"I took off one star for the simple reason that the ""push-buttons"" are a bit harder to depress than my arthritic hands would like. Other than that minor complaint, this is a good item, fair price, like the whisk attachment, decent power. Blended the only things I have tried it on so far very nicely with fine results.CCW"
5,Does a good job.,My husband had one of these that got broken so I bought him this as a replacement. He loves it!
2,Power Switch,The power switch is difficult to use.It would be nice to turn the switch onwithout having to hold down the powerswitch. I like the whisker.
1,Not durable at all!,I've only used it once for 15-20 minutes. The motor part got very hot after 15 minutes and then the teeth on the gear in the housing stripped out. I could not fix it because part of it stuck in the replacement head.Amazon CSR was very nice and gave me full refund. Anyway this product is definitely not worth the money...
1,Would not purchase,I've owned this hand blender for almost two years. It slips off the base at least once every time I use it. I end up having to use one hand to hold the end on the base. My other complaint is that you have to hold the button down - hard to do when I'm having to hold the two sections together so they don't slip off. I'm giving this one away and purchasing a new hand blender.
5,Makes my soap making easier.,This is the perfect product for making my soaps and lotions. Will be ordering another one for kitchen use. Thank you
1,"Poor product, uselesss warranty.",I bought this product and used the whisk attachment for a month or so without a problem. When we came to use the blender attachment it would not attach properly..infact as soon as you start to use it the attachment comes loose and falls off while it's in use. Pretty dangerous. The warranty is useless since you have to pay to ship back the old product (or at least some of it) and also send a check to cover (and then some) the shipping of a replacement. Since I'd rather not have another shoddy Hamilton Beach product I will put all that cash toward a better product by another manufacturer.
1,Attachment comes off when blending,"The attachment comes off while mixing.Also, water gets trapped in the top of the attachment and begins to RUST. The rust has started to leak thru into the blades.Would not buy again!!!!"
2,"Only works on 120V, not 220/250V","Chef's Choice 836 Petite Cone Expressonly works on 120V, not 220/250V. This is not indicated by amazon. A Step down transformer costing about $90 is required in countries using a power supply of 250 volt."
2,Don't buy this T-Track,"If this is the only T-Track you've bought you might think it's OK, but I bought some of this and some of the stuff from Peachtree woodworking (all through Amazon). The stuff from Peachtree is WAY better. This stuff the bolts almost fall out of. The 1/4 inch bolt that is supposed to fit is just a sloppy fit. The opening of the slot is large enough for a 5/16 bolt, but the slot for the head is about 1/32 too small to take a 5/16 bolt. The stuff from Peachtree is very tight, the 1/4 bolts slide in nicely but there is no slop or fear that you will pull the bolt out if you tighten it up. It's all about the same price so if you don't care about the fancy anodized gold color you will be much happier with the silver stuff."
3,It'll Pass an Afternoon,"I won't get into the plot because others have already touched on it. I will say, it's an okay read but don't expect anything that you'll be wanting to tell all your friends about. There are many interesting ideas in the book and it starts off well enough - but the conclusion feels contrived, even trite. It felt like Holt either wrote himself into a corner or got bored of working on the book.I still recommend it if you enjoy fairy tales with a new spin on them, but there are other books that have done the same thing better."
1,There's a reason for the low price,"One of the straps that holds a pouch to the belt broke on day 2 of using the product. By day 3 the fake ""leather"" loops on the pouches were being cut through by the metal rings that hold them to the belt.All in all, a low budget unit with low budget performance. It may be OK for a homeowner with an occasional task, but is definitely NOT for professional use. I only gave it one star because I it was required to submit the review."
2,"NOT leather, Akwardly sized","Although the description states that this is leather, buyers should know that the pouches themselves are not leather. They are some sort of fabric which makes thes much less durable than a leather setup. Also, the front pouches are very large which makes for an akward fit."
1,TRULY PATHETIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This has to be one of the worst movies ever made! Don't be fooled by the summary into thinking that this is a hard core prison drama. The inmates are about as fierce and intimidating as Mickey Mouse. It's long, boring and tedious. If you want a better prison movie try Scared Straight. Stay far the hell away from this one!"
5,A Book that Inspires Children to Write about Their Own Memories,"Wilfrid Gordon McDonald Partridge is a young boy trying to find the answer to the question, ""What is a memory?"" Wilfrid sweetly collects items that will help Miss Nancy find her memory. This book is extremely touching. When I read this book to teachers, there is not a dry eye left in the room by the time I am finished, including mine.I begin journal writing every year by reading Wilfrid Gordon McDonald Partridge by Mem Fox. (preschool - third grade / public school and homeschool) After Wilfrid Gordon McDonald Partridge helps Miss Nancy find her memory, I engage the children in a discussion about their own special memories. This gentle book inspires children to write about their memories. A much better approach to journal writing than impersonal writing prompts."
3,Sweet book,"This is a sweet story about a little boy who has a kind heart and wants to help an elderly woman ""find her memory."" The book is beautifully illustrated and nice to read. The story is a bit repetitive (but this is not a bad thing) so a bit tiresome to read. We will keep this on the reading list and see how our son reacts to it over multiple readings.Paige"
3,you get what you pay for!,"this product is okay. It works. I didn't want to pay a lot for something that was for the office.It made coffee quickly and It worked well.BUT...it's VERY thin - which means that it gets dangerously hot - so if you buy this, make sure to keep it away from kids and warn anyone who may be clumsy. Don't put it in a spot where someone may get too close...It also was difficult to pour coffee into it from on the table - and because it was SO hot, we couldn't dare to put it too close to the table's edge for fear someone would bump into it and burn themselves (which happened a few times before we moved it.) Luckily, we used this urn for DECAF and a nicer one for caffeinated, so it wasn't the focal coffee point...)."
3,gets the job done - coffee tastes average or below,"even when you buy expensive coffee and measure it out perfectly, the coffee comes out either okay or bad.plus, i went to target and saw something similar that costs less."
5,Worked great to keep my hot chocolate hot for a fundraiser!,I received my product on-time and it worked like a charm! I needed this in a hurry for a fundraiser during the holidays. I couldn't be more happy with the purchase.
4,"An introduction to Bond women, then and now","One of the Bond ""girls"" (there is a discussion in the film whether they should be called women) produced this film and starred in it. The film shows most of the women who appeared in the James Bond films until 2006. There are very short scenes showing them in the movies and we see them now, somewhat aged. The women tell how people responded to them more because of their appearances with James Bond than any other film or stage work. They also explain, among other things, how the behavior of the Bond women changed."
1,NOT U3 - Not as described,"This drive is described as a U3, but it is not. Amazon is misleading us with their listing."
1,WARNING - AMD Problem,The U3 software on this device does NOT install or work on an AMD-based machine. It seems to work OK on an Intel-basec machine
4,Good realistic crucifix,"Although there are some casting imperfections and some spotty paintwork, this is nonetheless a good price and a good crucifix for the Catholic home or organization.The horizontal wood section seems a bit too short at the bottom, as seen in the picture, and the varnish has runs here and there. Still, for the price, it can't be beat.I guess I have an issue with realistic crucifixes. If Christ were portrayed on the cross as he really looked, the result would probably be repulsive. Jesus was so badly beaten and bloody, his face so bruised and swollen, he was probably barely recognizable.Perhaps not historically correct, but there were black clouds at the time of the cruxifiction, so perhaps some short rain may have washed some of Christ's blood away. I don't know.I was quite overwhelmed when I received this. It is trully inspirational."
3,Cute,"Although these have stay cool handles when you use them on the stove to heat soup, remember to place them on something heat resistant for serving. I use these on the stove top for soups and gumbo and they heat beautifully. I have yet to make a souffle to test how they work in the oven.Easy clean up in the dishwasher. They sparkle with a little Bar Keeper's Friend."
5,Look forward to leftover food,These are lovely. I use them to save and later warm up leftovers. I cook Indian food and leftovers tastes much better when warmed up in all clad...no more microwaving and killing of flavors. Every since I started using these and other all clad pots for cooking and reheating my dishwasher is also not as full. These are so easy to clean by hand or in the dishwasher. These hold about 2 cups food and still some room left. I wish that they came with lids.
1,broken after 1 year,"This Hamilton Beach 6-slice toaster oven has never worked very well -- only toasted one side, so I had to always flip the bread to toast both sides. Broil doesn't work as only the bottom elements get hot.Now, after 1 year, the timer/start knob has stopped working -- it goes from timing the toasting right on to the keep warm setting, without turning off. I now have to keep the toaster unplugged when not in use, and time the toasting with my kitchen timer. Since the timer is also the on/off switch, there is no option to just toast without the timer.Piece of junk."
2,Many Thanks,"To whom it may concern,What an absolute pleasure it is to deal with the business people, WeMakeBeauty seller who still have integrity and good values to be proud of. I am sorry that something that has clearly been out of both of our control, has caused both of us some inconveniences etc but I am recommending your business to all my friends and I will not hesitate to use you in the future.It has been a pleasure doing business with you, and may I also take this opportunity of wishing you, your family and business a Happy Holiday and all the best success for you in the future.Kind regards,Jessica"
4,Like it,"I've been using the kettle for about 2 months. What I like is that it is attractive, has an automatic shut-off switch, heats the water quickly, is cordless and does not take up too much counter space in my small kitchen. What I don't like is that the measuring window is difficult to see because it is hidden behind the handle and it is very, in my opinion, loud while heating the water. The noise bothers me the most. The pros outway the cons therefore, go for it. :-)"
5,kettle,"This is the second one we have purchased, this as a gift. The one we purchased for our use has been excellent, best electric kettle ever. Used daily with no problems. highly reccomend."
1,Dangerous design,We bought this kettle - because we drink alot of tea. Ours was defective - the lid comes open unexpectedly as you pour releasing hot steam onto your hand. It is a painful surprise. The exterior is also hot - unsuitable to be around children.
1,"Looks nice, that's it","We got this kettle as a gift for our new house.After six months, the kettle started turning off instantly, making it useless. We looked at the brochure that came with it and thought, ah great, it comes with a 3 year warranty!Called the cuisinart customer service - they asked for the serial number and informed me that this kettle was made about 4 years ago, so they will not service this with no receipt. I tried to explain that this was a gift, and we have everything BUT the receipt, but the customer service representative did not care at all.This is very poor customer service for such a high priced item, and reading the other reviews, it seems the quality here is really sub-par.Stay Away."
3,simple fix to failure to work,"Like many other failures mine would not turn on. Called Cuisinart; although within guarantee period they needed receipt, Visa bill not sufficient. Simple mechanical fix: remove the bottom cover of the base recepticle Middle contact needed to be bent toward contact point on pot. My failure caused by overheating and bending of this contact. I crilled 4 small holes in top of base unit; improved ventilation should help prevent future problem. Works fine now. We love the pot; its too bad that poor design results in such a bad rating."
4,This is a very nice book on the Holocaust,"This book, We remember the holocaust, is a very good book. It is very discriptive and gives some very nice pictures. It has some nice opinions and sayings of what some people said after the holocaust. It also interviewed some people who have actually survived the holocaust. This book is a very imformative book and is pretty fun to read."
3,Rendered White,"Was it a good play? Like the painting which was the center of the debate between the three characters, Serge, Marc and Yvan, this can be subject of debate that may reveal what we think about each other. However, the play did not seem to rise to the level of greatness and only a fantastic last line left me remembering this play."
4,Exciting political romance set in NY and Washngton DC,"Don't miss this book - it's even better than the first book 'Above All, Honor' and the series gets even better in the 3rd 'Love & Honor', 4th 'Honor Guards' and 5th novel 'Honor Reclaimed'. The characters are endlessly interesting and the writing it terrific.Also look for the newest edition published by Bold Strokes Books December 2005.This is a Keeper !this from the publishers web site - A request from the commander-in-chief forces Secret Service Agent Cameron Roberts to break her word to the woman she loves-a woman who just happens to be Blair Powell, the president's daughter.In this sequel to Above All, Honor, Cam places duty before love, despite knowing that this decision may destroy her tenuous new relationship with the first daughter. As the rift between the lover's widens, more than one woman is happy to offer Blair the company that Cam cannot."
2,Not great,"I found this book very disappointing. Not comprehensive at all. If I hadn't paid just $1.00 for it, I would have returned it."
5,LOVED IT,"I love Tuvok, he is my absolut favorit... That is part of the reason I enjoyed reliving this episode fleshed out in a book. But I thought I got much more out of the book than I did from the episode. A book always gives you more insight into the person you are reading about than tv ever could. So if you love Tuvok there is noway around it, you have to read this book. If you liked the episode Flashback, you will enjoy this book... But don't take my word for it, pick it up and see for youself. Happy reading..."
4,great bargain for the quality,"I bought 3 of the Pacconi Ornament sets. For the price, the quality is outstanding! Very vibrant colors, each piece unique placed in wonderful wooden storage boxes.I received the items about 2 days after ordering and paid no extra shipping. I rate the products a 4 only because they are a bit on the small side and I don't remember if that was made clear in the product discription information. I would have bought them anyway...but feel that the size of the items should have been specified,i.e, 2"" to 4"" etc.... A definite 5 if that info was indeed disclosed."
1,not good!,"Dries very slow! although the sticker says dries 2x faster. oh, c'mon, takes forever, and then often leaves that white foam...not happy with the product.And yes, this is not the first glue I am using in my life and I know how glue should work."
2,Horrible for plastic and vinyl accessories,We used this to repair a Batman cowl/mask and it did not work at all. We even activated it but it wouldn't set quick enough because the vinyl was too flimsy and didn't adhere to the plastic quick enough. Use this for something else
3,"Kind of a disappointment, but faces a big issue.","""For Keeps"" is actually a pretty good movie, but it has badly handled material on pregnancy, abortion, and teen marriage. It irresponsibly trivializes teen pregnancy, but the cast is good and there are many times in this movie that make you want to cry. It's worth a chance, but remember it may not set a very good example. Kids under 16 shouldn't see it-there are quite a few mature themes in it that just might be a bit too much."
1,for keeps,I never received this movie and I'm a little tick off to say the least. I go to order something and I don't get the movie
3,Hitchcock's Bon Voyage & Aventure Malgache,Interesting wartime shorts....the movies are in French so it requires following sub-titles (a bit of a distraction). A bit unusual from the standard Hitcock fare; obviously driven by some wartime propaganda need for the Allies. These are somewhat rare pieces from extensive catalog of Hitchcock movies.
2,Doesn't burn your hair in only 3 minutes,"I'm 5'7, tall but don't have thick hair or a lot so if you want all of your leg hair off you probably have to wait about 12-15 minutes with this product."
1,SMELLS LIKE ROTTEN EGGS! You cannot breathe when you use this.,1. The stench is unbearable. I just used this and the smell was wretched. I had to turn my head in the other direction to breathe. It took a little hair off (about 5-10%) after the recommended 3+ minutes. It really is not effective and the stench is so overwhelming I thought I was getting lightheaded in the shower.
3,Recommendable to hard-core fans only,"The opening episode ""In the Pink of the Night"" is probably the best of the whole DVD. ""Pink Blueprint"" and ""Toro Pink"" are quite good, whereas the title episode ""Jet Pink"" lags in content and video quality. 1964 Academy Award winning ""Pink Phink"" features an earlier look -shorter and heavier- of the Pink Panther. The total 52 mins. did not look equally enjoyable to me. I must also note that the mono soundtrack is quite modest in terms of resolution and dynamic range.If you buy this DVD, you will probably keep seeing some of the episodes and skip the rest. I am happy to have bought this DVD but I must note that the overall quality is mediocre."
2,Holding out on me?,"I was disappointed severely after watching this DVD. I was completely absorbed in the animation, soundtrack and overall aesthetic of the cartoon for...LESS THAN AN HOUR! Last I checked a full DVD can hold several times that much video. UTILIZE IT. And I know there are many more cartoons that could have been put on here. Furthermore, the inspector and the ant & the aardvark were naively neglected in this dvd. I fully expect a boxed set of every pink panther cartoon to come out, featuring more cartoons. So I don't have to go through this review process again, just to complain.Incredibly upset,chadxxx"
4,"Only wanted more, what more can I say?","I bought this DVD as a gift for a friend, and on his birthday we watched it. We got some good laughs, and for those who say the video quality isn't good all I can say is...WHAT???? IT'S THE PINK PANTHER NOT ""TITANIC""!!! The video quality was clear with rich, vibrant colors. And the MONO SOUNDTRACK? Well folks, it should come as no surprise that cartoons were not recorded in Dolby Surround in the 1960's. Nor in stereo. It amazes me what people choose to complain about. Here it is. It's a hilarious set of cartoons that is so enjoyable that when it's over you'll wish the disc was longer. I wonder if they were joking when they put in English and French subtitles. The Panther doesn't speak, and I thought that was pretty funny even if accidental that they had empty subtitles. Buy this, you won't be sorry."
1,Even the library doesn't buy it.,"This book was had few real points, and those were highly controversial. The professor seems bitter and his mood changes from SA to SA. The transition is about as smooth as Mein Kampf, and the conclusions made were ludicrous! This is a conservative who is a Professor who becomes liberal and makes a point to reverse everything he once believed, the stereotyping is unintellectual and it was a struggle to finish this book. It isn't worth it!"
4,A fun CD to listen to.....,"I'm not sure what people expect out of a tribute cd? It's not suppose to be a carbon copy of the original thing! If so, it would be totally pointless. With that said, I feel like the musicians and especially the vocalist give their 100% when it comes to paying tribute to Journey. I'm really impressed with Eric Dover from Slash's Snakepit! Maybe he should've tried out for Journey when Steve left the band! If you enjoy vocals like I do and like to hear various takes and talent, then give this cd a shot. It's a fun cd to listen to."
5,"As of May 2008, this Saga STILL continues.....","I will not recite the many details already cited by the publishers and reviewers. What should give this book its second life (its first was not bad) is this ongoing saga STILL unfolding... Simon Mann recently turned over to EG authorities and promptly set to the dreaded Black Beach Prison (How many times has he said SORRY? And given his present plight, he will say that many more times)... new information in April-May 2008 on the ""real"" coup plotters. EG not shy to part with its oil money to extradite (Sir) Mark Thatcher through efforts with the Interpol on new information received. I've been to EG last June - just let me say it's a very interesting place. Read the book, follow the story still unfolding. The whole thing is quite an adventure... and as REAL as it gets!"
2,A flawed charmer,"This would have been a fine film of a vintage American play, but for the casting of Bobs Watson as ""Pud."" Beulah Bondi was a National Treasure and both Barrymore and Hardwicke are impeccable, but watching a truly atrocious child actor over-emoting in every scene in which he appears is excruciating. If you're more tolerant of truly bad acting than I am, the rest of the film is impeccable."
3,Excellent Movie; Poor Transfer,"While I'm still glad to own a copy of this favorite movie, I have to say I am very disappointed by the poor quality of the transfer. It looks to have been copied from a dirty and severely faded print or tape.I've recently purchased from Amazon.com other DVD-R demand products, including Ruggles of Red Gap (Universal Vault) and Life With Father (Digicom Studios). Both of those transfers were absolutely marvelous. I will be cautious about purchasing another product from the Warner Archives without first checking for reliable reviews of the transfer quality."
1,SAVE THE TREES......,"Save the trees, save your time, save the electricity. Phleeaze, don't do another one! . As for the 'self-editing', I think I could have done a better job. Punctuation - where was it? Oh, I did enjoy one chapter, ""Life Long Buddies""."
1,Dougs Opinion..,"Well, like previous readers, I was certainly ready for a laugh, although I couldn't even get to the end. I was rather lost as to who was having conversations and what they were talking about. Maybe I'll try to finish it at a later date..much later."
5,One of the best!,"A girl is being stuck at summer.Her mother hired a mother's helper,she has a nice smile but a heart of evil, and Amanda is the only one who knows it! This is the best Fear Street I ever read.The story is full of surprising happenings."
1,Dwell / Tach,Works great and a very good price. This isn't flimsy junk that I was worried about but a simple dwell tach for use on cars with breaker points.I would have liked to see rubber over the clamps that afix to the coil instead of a plastic but not a big concern. This was the best price available here at Amazon after some comparison shopping.Update. Died last month (July 2012) after a few uses since I purchased this item. Won't buy another.
1,Actron CP7605 Tach/Dwell/Volt Meter,"Purchased this tester to set all specifications on three of my classic vehicles.Hooked UP TO VEHICLE #1 RPM had no reading. Hooked up to Vehicle #2 and 3 stillno reading. Returned this tester and purchased a Actron CP7677. All vehiclesrunning fine now. This does not mean the Actron CP7605 is not a good tester, Ijust received a bad one that got by quality control. If I could not have gottenthe CP7677, I would have reordered the Actron CP7605.I, have used Amazon for many years and have never had a problem with a productI could not return. There service is the kind you do not get much of anymore."
5,Good Dwell Meter,"This meter was purchased to replace another Actron I have used for years. The first one I ordered from Amazon was defective (needle would not zero) but the replacement was quick from Amazon, and it worked well. It is best to order one of these online as they are no longer sold at parts stores since there are so few vehicles that use points and condensers."
5,Another Great Record,"Freitas has made another great record. ""Summer Hearts"" is a song for the ages. Epic, sweet, sad...It will remind you of being young, and in love, in the Central Valley, in the summer, at night, in a car, driving home."
2,characters don't come to life,"Desdemona is an odd ball in her family. She comes from a family of theater people, but she doesn't have any of the family talent for acting. Instead, she runs a catering company that helps keep the rest of the family financial stable.Stark runs a computer security company and first meets Desdemona when he is jilted and Desdemona is trying to collect on her catering bill for a wedding that never happened.The characters in the book seem flat and with about 100 pages left I found myself skimming because I didn't really care what happened. Sometimes the characters just acted completely irrationally. For example, they didn't call the police when major evidence was found in a murder case. I just couldn't get into it when the characters seemed so ridiculously unreal."
2,Fitment Issues,"The only reason it got the 2 is because the hazard switch was able to fit into it. I received the Scosche Aa1568B Pocket/Double Iso Installation Kit For 2002 and Up Acura Rss and it would not fit an aftermarket radio. The hole for the aftermarket head unit was almost an inch too small on each side. Then to my added frustration there was no way that the din/pocket compartment in the lower was able to be attached. It was as if they expected you to somehow get the unit in after trimming and then just sort of stick the pocket in there. I was not happy and didn't want to deal with it any more or take the chance of trimming incorrectly and mess up. I also hated how the pocket wouldn't attach to anything. I like the clean look, not the custom, back woods, modified version. Needless to say I sent the item back and ended up going with the Metra. Way better hands down."
1,Won't fit aftermarket radio,Unless you plan to dremel out the area to make the radio fit then this won't work for any aftermarket radio. Don't waste your time and money.
4,Panoptica - 01 * 02 * 03 * 04,"Honestly, the least important thing that you need to know about Panoptica is that he's from Mexico, because if you're expecting some sort of clichéd Latin-American flair to his compilation of EPs for Certificate 18, 01 * 02 * 03 * 04, you'll be sorely disappointed. Instead, you'll find techno that certainly would be at home in any country. From the acid breaks of ""Kinky Bisturi"" to the upbeat melodies of ""El Chivero De Tepatoche"" this album is proof that electronic music is a universal genre. If anything, there's a slight German influence--listen to the Basic Channel-style dub of ""Esquirla"" and ""Torero T"" or the bright, sparkling tech-house of ""Y Ahora."" But the chunky beats and synths of ""Tecnica Manana"" and the industrial leanings of ""Pluma"" also point to other influences as well. Panoptica proves that Mexico is ready to join the world stage of electronic music."
1,Chips and gets hot in the microwave.,They look nice but the plates are a pain to fit in the dishwasher. The whole set gets really hot in the microwave despite saying microwave safe. They also chip easily.
5,Fantastic!,We love Transformer series.This eddition was not available in Amazon Japan so we are quite happy.We expect new version be available in soon.
1,Itty Bitty Tricycle,"My sister in law was the one that chose this after many hours of research for her daughter. I recieved and put together 12/23/07 and burst into tears this was the smallest, cheepest looking piece of junk I had seen. So I did the maddash Christmas eve and found her a bike that was perefect. The picture is very decieveing and the quality is NOT worth the money or the shipping."
4,"Not Quite the Best, but close enough!","I am an avid reader of Cooks Illustrated. This Maverick is not the highest rated meat thermometer, bit it is second. The highest rated, Thermopen, cost over $90; this one costs less than $15. It seems accurate and takes about 5 seconds to get a reading. The on/off switch is not easy to do and it does not seem to have an ""auto-off."" I barbeque outside a lot both in winter and summer. Last night I barbequed a turkey. I wish the temperature was lit because I had to have a flash light to use the thermometer on the side away from the deck lights. In the kitchen it is perfect. I use it not only for meat but for making sure food is warm enough when being re-heated, making sure baked squash and other cooked vegetables are done, It works fine and is the right price."
4,Cool deal,"I guess they didn't have the exact product in so they replaced it with 3 extra small cones in a clear plastic locking container. It keeps it fresh and we have used it several times. Delivery was insanely fast., I actually had it 2 days after I ordered it."
5,Must-have jaws for electronic workstation,"Open wide, bite down, say ahh. Smooth operation, secure clamping, versatile. I replaced the less expensive version. Should'a done it a long time ago."
1,It works if you can get the thing running,I had an original flowtron 150 that worked great but a lightning storm fried the electronic panel and I replaced it with a new Flowtron 150. The newer models have a pressure valve in the gas tubing and I have yet been able to get the machine functioning. The machine is constantly blinking like it is not getting any propane..I have returned two of the new models and nobody seems to have an answer why they aren't working. I know how to run them because I owned a earlier model but this new model needs to go back to the drawing board..
3,Didn't really help me,"This stuff works very well as a facial scrub, it's full of granulated ingredients. It smells very mild as well. Unfortunately, it didn't do much to minimize the pores on my nose at all. They are still very large. I'll continue to use Biore products but this one was a bit of a let down for the price I paid. After this tube is done I wont be using it again."
5,good buy,"Absolutely love it! It was my baby's first puzzle,she got it when she was 1 year, It was too complicated for her at that time. She mastered it when she was probably around 20 months. But now she is 2.5 years and loves all kinds of puzzles. Free time for me and hours of entertainment for her."
5,Happy Toddler,"My grandson who is a huge Wiggles fan, loves his new Wiggles Cutlery set and uses it every day. The set is sturdy and just perfect for a three year old."
2,Does not do Jo Dee justice,"I must say I was highly disappointed in this CD. I love Jo, but I guess her songs were not meant to be 'picked on'. The songs are all played two beats to fast and the attempts to make the instruments ""sing"" like Jo Dee are sad - especially the flat fiddle.""Heads Carolina, Tails California"", ""Your Not in Kansas Anymore"" and ""That's the Way"" are the highlights, ""Burn"" sounds nothing like the original, ""Bring on the Rain"" is worse and everything else is mediocre at best. I pity if Carolyn Dawn Johnson ever heard this version of ""Downtime"" (which she co-wrote).This CD is much more for the fans of hardcore Appalacian mountain bluegrass music, not so much for the Jo Dee Messina fans. Save your money - do not buy this CD! Pick up Jo Dee's first CD if you don't already have it!!"
3,Good product.. Instructions incomplete,"This dash kit is decent. I'm no expert on car stereo installation, but I've done a few over the years. The plastic parts fit together well as long as you can figure them out. Unfortunately my instruction booklet was missing the diagrams for my Toyota Celica. It had the correct page, but most of the information was absent. Bad printing or something. A couple of parts needed to be physically cut which was somewhat difficult due to the thick plastic. Part of the instructions said to remove the grayed out sections in the picture, but since there were no pictures I had to figure out which parts those were on my own which took much longer than I had planned.Overall a fair deal. It looks good when it's finished and it seems durable. I can only give it 3 stars because of the instructions otherwise I would probably give it 4. I would prefer a dash kit that was less universal and more tailored to my particular vehicle."
5,An excellent book!!,"I really enjoyed this book. It captivated me. The story is action, action, action. The character development is very well done. I love star trek and star wars and I usually don't like many other books, but this was very good. Read this book if you love Sci-fi and action!"
3,Oh Well...,"I happened upon this book which one of my children brought home this Spring. Is it readable? Yes, but I found the writing style awkward and somewhat confusing. The Characters and plot devices were original, but shallow. Call me a geek, but I would have liked more information on how and why a nano-machine would explode and why only one individual in the galaxy possessed this apparently useful innovation than listen to our hero lament the loss of his wife, his best bud, and various body parts. Read it if the book falls in your lap, but don't expect Heinlein."
5,Wrong Region Code,The Region Code on the product is region 0. The dvd does not play well on region 1 dvd players. I wonder if there is any region 1 dvd ever made for this same opera.
1,poor quality,One of the pillow cases had a three inch rip in the seam within a week of use. I took a chance on this item because I'm not a big fan of egyptian cotton and this item has convenced me not to buy egyptian cotton again
3,differant,i found it very enjoyable probly best for a quiet sunday afternooni really liked when dan and the back up siners when back and forth
5,Yet Another Reznor Masterpiece...,"Amazing track, great album... this single is a must for all Nine Inch Nails fans."
1,This song is crap!,The video is crap and it is on here too and so you get a crap song and video. Trent's career is GETTING SMALLER which is what he deserves for putting out crap. This album has only gone gold and it has been out for nearly 20 weeks. The Fragile went 2 platinum in about 16 weeks of release. So that is a big drop in sales.
1,Who would ever make a movie after the skanky tween dolls?,"Ever since I first heard that they were making a Bratz Movie I said to myself ""This is going to be the stupidest movie ever"", and frankly it was. It is a story based off the freak dolls who live in a perfect world. The movie trailer literally tells you how it ends. You know they defeat the popular girl and they win the guy. You have to be an idiot to not know how it ends. The movie was highly unrealistic, I mean what school is ruled by cliques, and what girl has an elephant at a party? The movie is very stupid, predictable, and the cast is basically composed of unknown stars who probably are doing nothing now. What genius thought that it would be cool to make a movie off the stupid doll company which portrays a anorexic, skanky version of what a girl should look like. The Bratz movie is just like the dolls, Fashion crazy, stupid and lack everything to be entertaining."
4,good quality but purple,"Our stage lights are a bit warmer in color temperature so the film looked more purple than blue. We used the film for an Easter play as part of a night scene with green light filters, the effect was stunning, also looked good for the flash of lightning effect."
2,"Fun toy, poor quality.","The printing on mine was tilted by about an inch so the image didn't line up with the border. Since the scene has a black border, it's really noticeable.The trim wasn't sewn on completely and my son pulled it off. This of course pulled a thread on the carpet material and removed the picture all the way across the carpet about an inch wide.The carpet itself smaller than you think when looking at the picture. It's about from your fingertips to your elbow across.Besides the obvious quality issues, this is a really fun 'toy' for my son and a year later is still used."
5,Really nice product,We bought this for my son when he was 4 and he is 7 now and he still loves playing with it and so does his 4 year old sister. It is made really well and it is not made out of cheap material. It also is a good size that 2 kids can play with it and not have a problem.
5,Love it!,My kids want to hear this constantly in the car and I don't mind a bit! I think it is hilarious that they now know all the words to Bicycle Built for 2 and Surrey With the Fringe on Top.
5,"Schiff has only been aroung for, like, ever!","Seems like they've been around a hundred years. I've been using their food products every since I was a kid. This is why I picked Schiff, as you can never tell when it comes to health products like these. They are not regulated so you got to go with the people who have been legitimate players in the market.I can't live without Glucosomine and this company is becoming one of the few that makes the regular type of this joint medicine. I call it that because I can't go without it for more that three days, and I can barely walk! I blew out all my joints in the Army and this product helps tremendously to keep me mobile. I seem to have developed an intolerance for the chondroiten mix(or however you spell it). So I'm sticking with Schiff; everyone else is dropping the plain product these days; that just won't work. Thanks Amazon and your merchants and Schiff for making life possible!"
3,Freddy Fresh - Music For Swingers,"Freddy Fresh is back with more breaks to make your feet sweat. The tracks on Music For Swingers is unabashedly good-natured and full of fun. ""Used To Be Bad"" throws in some grunts, just to let you know what you should be doing, while ""Dig This!"" revives some old-skool funk. The organ and stuttering loops on ""Hillbilly 303"" let us know that this isn't meant to be taken seriously, so get on your feet and enjoy. Since this album is aimed more at the dancefloor, the individual tracks don't stand out much, but that's fine. They were meant to get you moving, no more, no less."
3,Great Game... over too quickly,"I got this game for my birthday and within a week I had beaten the game. It is a great game, killer graphics, great story line but it is over too quickly.If you want your D&D; fix, it is a great buy. But for a challenge taking you months and months to finish... this is not the game to buy."
1,Dim Light,I bought this light with the expectation of being able to spotlight hunt wild hogs at night using the red lens. This light will not shine past 12 feet with the red lens cover on it. Do not waste your money on this light as there are better lights out there without the lenses for less money.
1,Waste of Money,Kevin Smith is one of the best writers in show business today - from comics to films he has achieved great things. That's why this DVD is such a disapointment. If you take out all of the unfunny and crude penis jokes your basically left with no value for money. I was hoping for an insight to the mans' great writing skills. Nothing. Jason Mewes makes an appearance and only adds vulgarity.
4,4 hours of great Stories! A must buy,"Each disc contains 2 hours (4 hours total) of straight Q&A; between the students and Kevin. Kevin ""whity satirical dialog"" often leads into hilarious stories of his personal and professional experiences. His stories about Prince, Superman reborn, meeting his wife, meeting Jay for the first time, PTA, protesting Dogma, and Jay's porn career are classics. The editing did a good job of cutting out many of the questions that have been answered in Kevin's many interviews. Parts of these stories have been heard before but here they are presented with much more depth and detail.The lack of dvd extras was a let down. And only 1 Easter egg found so far. Unlike Kevin's movies this disc may not lead repeat viewing for most viewers.This DVD is a must for Kevin Smith fans."
5,AWESOME! TOTALLY AWESOME,"If you're like me and you own the collections of the movies and cartoons that Kevin Smith & Jason Mewes have done, this is a needed addition. When I first saw it on the shelves at the store, I wondered. When I came home and listened and watched the first 30 minutes of it, I was hooked. I have watched this set of DVDs almost as many times as I saw the first StarWars, and that was 65 times! Way to go KEVIN! Thanks again for a great DVD. Now, if you can do this again next year, or actually do the space adventure you mentioned (sitting on a rocket, someone said lunch...) that would be great. Jay & Silent Bob in Space! Best regards, Michael Murdock"
3,3.75 stars,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Lugh is the most hilarious side character and I wish there was a whole book about him. At the end there was a loose end regarding trust that wasn't completely resolved, otherwise I would have given 4 stars."
2,there are no real success's,I am pleased that the book talks about being responsible and that is why I rate this a 2. I just don't think we need to teach more people how to breed with the pet overpopulation problem we are having in our country. It is a good book if in the right hands.
2,The Complete Handbook is not complete,"This book gives the reader a very high level overview of dog breeding however, there is nothing of interest here for the professional breeder looking to increase their knowledge. If you've never bred a dog you might find this useful. I did not."
3,You wont enjoy this game if you are an adult gamer looking for a racing game to play,"This game is very cute and fun, but this is one of those type of games that has been designed and created for little kids. It's very easy and dumbed down compared to other racing games ever made. This one is for the kids only. If you want a good racing game for a hand held system. Buy mario kart for nintendo ds or crash nitro kart for gba"
4,truck light,They look good & they got to me FAST. But the bolts rusted in just a few days of mounting on the pushbar of my truck. That was the only problem i had with them.
4,interesting book,"when I first read the book I thuoght it was boring but it does teach a good lesson, and the title is clever with the robin hood reference!"
3,paraffin wax refills,These did not work as well as the paraffin wax beads which melted much quicker. I did not realize I was ordering so much of it and will not need to order again for a long time
3,Hard to Break Up,"I bought the unscented paraffin, and it is effective and soothing when melted in a paraffin bath. However, I found these blocks very hard to break up so that they would melt more easily. The paraffin beads that came with my unit break apart and melt much more easily. The shipping charges for six one-pound blocks was somewhat high. I am going to try to find the unscented paraffin beads at a local beauty supply in order to avoid the high shipping charges."
2,Triclosan?,The price was very good and the shipping was very fast but the item description did NOT say it was antibacterial. You might think that if we are ordering unscented stuff that we would not want triclosan in there either. Not the end of the world but I wouldn't have purchsed it if I knew that stuff was in there.
5,Best informational book of all time,"If I were a richer woman, I would be buying up copies of this by the boatloads and distributing them as party favors and gifts. Not only has it been a pleasure to read, but by surrounding myself in a focused ""study"" of Moss's dream theory/reality, I've immersed my subconscious in the task at hand - to dream Big dreams and to get much more out of my sleeping states beyond pleasant fancies.Completely renewed my sense of spirituality. It doesn't matter what your religious orientation (including atheism) is, this book has the power to inviggorate the spirit and make sense of much more than your nightly hours if you let it.One of the best books I've ever read. If not the first best, then it's the second best (and certainly the best book on the subject)."
2,I was part of the production on this film,Filmed in Cincinnati during My senior year in High School I had acted and Modeled some. I landed a spot as a Stand-In for Doug Hutchinson and Ben Stiller. It has to be one of the Worst Films ever. Molly couldn't even keep her southern twang consistent in the shots. I must say though it was a pleasure to work with Ben Stiller and Doug Hutchinson (Percy from Green Mile) I still have a Cast and Crew Jacket that Ben signed and I was even able to have Molly sign it at the final Cast party during one of her kindler moods. Heck I even have picturesGreat scenerary if you are from the area.On a personal note Molly has her good moments although rare.Andrew McCarthy was just.... well a jerk.Ben was Great to me and so was most of the crew especially the Sound Master Hank Garfield and Sue Knutsen in CastingFrom this I was able to work as a stand-in on Rainman and had several screen tests for other movies and TV shows.
2,It didn't do what it supposed to....,"We usually buy similar product from Target which was very very good. I wanted to try this one, but we are not at all satisfied with the results. We have poured almost all the liquid on a silver plate. But there is no difference at all.Then we tried the same old product, it was amazing.I recommend ""Connoisseurs Revitalizing Silver Jewelry Cleaner""."
3,Not like the others . . .,"While this book is still pretty much a page turner there are some issues that are just too annoying to deal with. While it is funny at times for Betsy to throw Eric the cold shoulder, this time it was kind of painful to read. I hate to say, Betsy is the one character in the book I actually hate now.Given, I am only halfway through the book I still find it to be lacking. There were some parts that seemed like a hurried joke that fell short making it more of a tongue twister than anything else. With that being said, I still like the series and plan to read the series."
4,Worth a read..,"Now granted, this is so far the weakest book in the series. But, it was still funny, and I rather liked the -Psycho Betsy- moments. I was a little disheartened by the ""Half-sister is daughter of the devil"" angle. Series tend to lose there punch when characters get to over-powered to be believed. But, I'd still recomended it, and the entire series."
3,not as great as #1 & #2,"I agree with the other reviewers--this book was disappointing. Way too many unanswered questions (it's OK to ""keep 'em guessing"" to get readers to read the next book, but too many questions is just plain annoying). A climactic clash at the end of the book that was a big yawn--it came somewhat out of the blue and Betsy barely defended herself. Even the sex scenes were luke warm. And I paid hardcover price for this??!! It's annoying when publishers switch to hardcover to cash in on a popular author; I'll pay it, grudgingly, for my favorite authors. But when it's a waste of my money, that really pisses me off. I blame MJD's editor(s) and publisher for this debacle. MJD, I've read a lot of your books and stories, and I love your writing. Please don't sell out like this again. AND I will buy the next installment."
2,loved the first one,"even though there were times betsy was a tad too crude. but the crassness was offset by genuine laugh-out-loud humor, great characterizations, and a wonderfully satiric attitude toward the vampire genre.i didn't think the second was quite as good, but still worth reading.this one...well, aside from it being rushed (at about the speed of light), it's really hard to believe someone forgives having their throat torn open, not to mention some of the other episodes. and while some of the other plot devices showed promise, they were pretty superficial. this may be what happens when an author publishes two novels in less than a year.also, by this time, betsy should be growing a bit.i've cancelled the pre-order on the next book--perhaps when it comes out in paperback, i'll try it used."
5,Another Great Betsy Taylor Book!,The Undead Betsy Taylor series is funny and a great read! While this book was admittedly not as funny as the previous two it was still funny and still great. I definately recommend that if you haven't read the series you read it!
4,entertaining fluff - it grows on you,"Queen Betsy and the gang are here for a third round - and what a round! This time, Betsy finds out that her bitchy stepmother is pregnant with Betsy's half-sibling - and not for the first time! Betsy sets out to find her half-sister who just happens to be the child of the Devil. No, really. Oh, and did I mention that Betsy finally admits she loves Sinclair?This series has definitely grown on me. Betsy is annoying me less. It's not because she's getting any smarter or any less vapid, but because I'm getting used to her, and growing to love her as a character. And Sinclair! Hoo boy, he just gets hotter with each book!I know this is a short review - I'm hurrying off to read book 4!"
3,Not appreciated,"Sorry Miss Davidson. This book lacked something... maybe interesting characters? Laura is cool but there wasn't anything else going on. Give your readers some credit, we get off on subplots and new characters. I am very glad I reserved this from the Library and didn't pay that God awful hardcover price. A quick read that didn't make me laugh, the sex scences were still hot, maybe a little too hot, but nonetheless, I am still a fan of Betsy's."
2,enjoyable bit of fluff,"I did enjoy Undead and Unappreciated. Betsy is possibly starting to grow up a bit, some of the things that I found very grating indeed in the first book have stopped (all that name-calling...), and of course, reading about the shoes is always fun. :) The high point of this book is dropping in on some familiar and beloved characters, just to see what they're up to.On the other hand, this short little book should have been published in paperback. It's just not long enough or complex enough to justify hardback, a move which screams that the publisher is trying, rather crassly, to cash in on the success of this series. That's a shame. The content of the book isn't even dense enough for a short story, hence the two stars."
2,Disappointed ..,"I loved the first two books in this series. They were fun and different. This installment seemed rushed and not well thought out. It is an all right read but it is nothing compared to the first two books. I missed the Betsy flavor, the tongue in check goods times. It was darker, less interesting, and the author seemed bored.Perhaps, I expected too much I have been waiting on the next installement for a very long time.Still readable but not great."
1,Didn't work for me,I exercised and used a moderate diet but this just did not work for me. It also made me feel a little nausea so I stopped taking it.
4,"Great axe, but too short","Love the way this axe splits wood. It has impressed others that I have split wood with. With that said I wish I would have bought the longer one because the swing arc is so short that if you miss the blade heads right towards your feet. I will be buying the 36"" model."
1,Not really Mott.,This is a six track single.Mott provide the backup for these demos.There is no reason for you to buy this.
3,Nice but incomplete,"What's here is good, but it is woefully incomplete. As has been pointed out before, this ""Greatest Hits"" album is missing their later hits ""Fallin In Love"", and ""Winners and Losers."" Despite what a previous review said, these songs were released under the ""Hamilton, Joe Frank, and Reynolds"" name in 1975, despite the fact that Reynolds had left the band and been replaced by Dennison earlier. They did not change the name of the group to ""Hamilton, Joe Frank, and Dennison"" until their next album, which flopped (maybe they shouldn't have messed with success)."
2,Disappointed!,I have searched so long for this CD and I was very disappointed. Not all the songs are original. Next time I will research a little better. Vanessa in VA
3,I need more . . .,"I assumed the album would contain all the greatest hits based on its title. I was extremely disappointed that Fallin' in Love was not included. It's my favorite. That makes the title misleading. It would have been the proverbial ""icing on the cake"" for an otherwise nice album."
4,Good service,"Received the product on time, if I don't find this product fora lower price, I will use this company again."
2,"Good Idea, But No...","What's unfortunate about this book is that it had the potential to be good, a chance at providing real insight into the Japanese psyche. Fields, an Australian resident who grew up in Japan seems qualified to attempt such a work. However, the book falls flat.The dustjacket summary and title are misleading as the book is written solely from the viewpoint of business and sales, which isn't even alluded to on the cover. This could be overlooked if that were a fulfilling aspect, but even that is not very substantial. I came away from this book with a few anecdotes about how not to market Western goods in Japan, and that's about all. I wouldn't reccomend buying this book for general insight, OR business acumen."
2,This is NOT d-alpha tocopherol,"According to the seller, and contrary to what is stated in the item description and the pictures of the labels provided, this product is synthetic (dl-alpha tocopherol) and not natural (d-alpha tocopherol - the active isomer) vitamin E. From the seller: ""Please note that due to the industry wide shortage of Natural Vitamin E,the Vitamin E you have listed below as well as all other Vitamin E supplements by Swanson contain the dl-alpha version."" Of course, the ""industry wide shortage of Natural Vitamin E"" doesn't mean that natural vitamin E is not available, but only that it is more expensive."
4,Perfect for the weekend hobbyist,"This book takes you well through the ins and outs of the Gen. III small block. While the technical detail is a little lacking, it perfectly complements the standard skills and comprehension levels of the average weekend racer. I'd recommend this book for anyone contemplating a modification to this superlative power plant."
2,Average,"About what youd expect from an ""H.P."" published book. Theres nothing in this book that you wont find on the internet in the forums. This book is basically a review of the STOCK LS1 and LS6 Engines. Most of the modifications coverd in the book are done so in poor detail. No mention of emissions compatibility and street legality whatsoever. Some usefull info on stock LS1's but other that that, not of much value."
2,Too Much Fun!,"The seat is fun to play with, but that is also the problem. My son was so distracted with the features and songs he NEVER sat still long enough to go to the bathroom."
1,Cute but not worth it!!!!!!!!!,The potty is cute but it's not worth the money. It sings before my daughter even uses it. As soon as she sit down it starts singing..Whats the point? I was expecting it to sing only if she potty. So she has no clue when she does something right.
4,Great Potty Seat,"My son loves this potty seat. We bought it for him when he first expressed interest in potty training although he only sat on it fully clothed. He loves to dance to the music. It's now about a year down the road and he is actually using it. I love how it says ""open"" or ""up"" when he lifts the toilet lid to use it b/c then I know he's using it. A lot of other reviews complain about the loudness and the annoying sensitity. There is a switch in back where you can turn all the sound OFF. Overall I thought this was great product; hopefully we can wean him off of it soon and get him going in the big potty."
3,Too much going on,"This potty has been great for my son to pretend on while we are using the real potty, but has way too many ""bells & whistles"". He was only 18 mos. when we bought this potty and was talking about the potty constantly so we thought we'd give it a try, but all he does is play with the potty. He even walks around singing the songs. It did get him interested, and he sits and pretends to go, but then starts playing with the t.p. and setting off the sensors that reward him for going when he hasn't. He is now 23 mos. old and we are trying the BabyBjorn potty. Hopefully less distractions will be better."
3,Fun But Annoying,"I bought this potty for my two year old when I started to train her. I liked the fact that she could pull out and empty the potty herself, and it looked like a real potty. I was however disappointed with all the musical and noises that it made. It was very distracting, and she would not actually go in the potty till I took out the batteries. I wish it did just a simply reward noise after she did her business. The flushing handle and toliet paper noises kept her to distracted to actually go. It said ""Up and Down"" when you put up and down the lid, and gave a musical reward for just sitting. It would have been better if it just gave a reward for going in the potty, plus I am sure that it would have made it more cost friendly. If you buy this do yourself a favor and not put in the batteries when you give it to your child."
2,"More of a toy, biggest problem: flimpsy splatter guard","I agree, this is more of a toy. My 2 1/2 yr old twin boys took to playing/sitting on it immediately, and as other reviews stated, it sang ""you went potty"" when they clearly didn't. My biggest grip, however, is the urine splatter guard for usage w/boys. The guard doesn't ""clamp"" on tight at all, so when my kids simply sit down, the guard falls off, or it simply falls off when they try to lift the seat. When I called to complain to FP, they didn't seem concerned -- don't they even test their products??!! Also agree w/how low it is to the ground, and it only accomodates a 40 lb child - other seats are good for 50 lb child. Save your $$, and go w/a cheaper potty."
3,Not for big kids,"We are not disappointed with this product, but wish we would have found it sooner.We bought this for our 2.5 year old who was having trouble potty training. She thinks it is fun and uses it, but the seat is very low and the opening too small for her, which can create a mess, especially when she is in a hurry.We look forward to trying this with her younger brother though."
3,Great Premes,"The 1st season was good ( Especially while watching under the influence of canibus ). Season 2 was O.K., but after that, it became the Seymore and Myrna show and it SUCKED!!!!"
2,Regional codes?,Family Business - The 1st Season comes with 3 discs.Discs 2 & 3 are unreadable because of a problem called 'regional code'! Go figure!Thoroughly disappointed.Bummer. The 1st disc was cool.An expensive problem.
5,Bring It on!!!,This is pretty funny! For once the girl is not some helpless person that is super nice to everyone and needs a guy to save her. I love the playful fighting and trying to one up each other play that happens between the two main characters. I have read all 4 of the books that are out and I like them all. I don't know if or when 5 will be come out but book 4 ends like it could be the end. So you will not have to worry about a cliff hanger that you never get to finish! I think this is a must read if you like to laugh!
3,Tortoise loves it but too much sugar,My tortoise eats it enthusiastically when I give it to him as a little treat. However after looking more closely at the ingredients it is mostly all artificial with added sugar. Adding sugar seems unnecessary to me.
3,Nice read,"Captures the atmosphere of downtown NO but the story line is not as enjoyable as the movie based on this novel. I know it is not usually said but,....the movie is better."
3,MLB gets it wrong again,"MLB has an unfortunate tendency to give the customers what they want us to have, rather than what we really want.In 2004, they gave Sox fans a ""complete"" DVD set from the ALCS and World Series. But where was the ALDS? Most Sox fans probably would have paid extra for those three exciting games, had they been available. Once again, MLB has come up short with their ""complete"" DVD set: you get the anti-climactic 2007 World Series, but only the last three games of the ALCS. Why only a fraction of a series? Why only games 5-7? Just because, it would seem. Want to see Josh Beckett's dominating performance in Game 1 against Cleveland? Too bad, MLB didn't deem it worthy of inclusion.This collection isn't bad, it's exactly what it advertises itself as. But it could have been so much better."
2,WS DVD s/b PPD,"I really hoped MLB & A&E; had learned from the 2004 experience that fans want the complete set of games, including the ALDS games. Instead, they give us a more incomplete product! This set does not include games 1 through 4 of the ALDS. We miss out on the first game - a Beckett gem. And the excitement of games 2 - 4, when Cleveland proved they were true contenders!And while the 2004 set lacked the 3 ALDS games against the Angels, at least it was produced in HD. This World Series set was rushed to market, so much so that it is not in HD or widescreen, which are practically automatic on all DVDs today.So while I appreciate MLB's effort to get a product out in time for the holidays, I truly wish they had postponed the offer until such time the entire postseason series of games could be made available in 1 set - with all the viewing perks!"
2,Three Strikes,"A called third strike for MLB on their ""The Boston Red Sox 2007 World Series Collector's Edition."" Note that the presentation is in standard sound and square screen video format. I'll have to make due with my memories of FOX's dolby digital high-def original broadcast."
3,2007 World Series Collection DVD,"If you want to buy this product and you want all the games, dont get it has three of the seven games of ALCS not like 2004. What gives"
3,How to you get the radio announcers?,"This is not a bad set. However, there no direction or choice for the radio announcers vs. the Fox announcers (who no self-respecting Red Sox fan can stand). I'm pretty savvy with stuff like this, but can't find it anywhere. Can anyone out there help?"
3,Bare Minimum,"Why does everything have to be a cost-saving, let's give em the absolute minimum. Why no widescreen? It is 2007 isn't it? Yes there are still people who don't have a widescreen TV, so why not offer the set in both standard and widescreen? I don't have a HD/BluRay player, but why not a HD release also? Why not include all ALCS games? If any of these issues have meaning to you, then this is not the product for you."
4,Very cute book!,"I bought this book last night and I think it is great! My son is autistic (age ten) and I have a younger daughter (age five) who is not, this book is great for her. I think it would be a good book for younger kids, to help them understand some of the aspects of being on the autism spectrum. The cats are really cute too."
1,Not What I Expected,I'm glad we checked this one out from the library before purchasing. It was extremely disappointing and I can't believe all the positive reviews. My son is on the spectrum and I thought this book would help draw parallels between our cat's quirks and his own and then show how it's ok to be quirky like a cat. This book was overly blunt at times and did little to help my son and his brothers understand Asperger's Syndrome. Maybe it's a cultural difference between Europe and the United States but I do not feel that this book is appropriate to read with a child dealing with an Autism Spectrum Disorder. It made him feel like an outcast.
3,Cute.,"As a special education teacher and a cat lover, I certainly agree that cats have autism. The book is cute and a little silly, but certainly nothing profound."
5,Great book,"Great, entertaining book! It was very well written. A very enjoyable book. It was an easy read and the photos were wonderful."
1,God this sucks!,"Valor, real name Skippy, is NOT the real singer of Christian Death. The only REAL Christian Death is with ROZZ WILLIAMS; I don't care WHAT Gitane DeMone's reason's for staying were; NOTHING justifies having your name on this piece of s***! Skippy's voice is godawful; his lyrics are worse than that; the music is absolute trash; [ I'm sure Gitane would agree!} the band sounds as if they don't know how to play! Do yourself a favor: unless the album is Rozz Williams/C. Death like Only Theatre of Pain, Path of Sorrow, Ashes, or says "" C. Death featuring Rozz Williams "", don't waste your money OR 30- 45 min. { felt like hours } of your life on this dreck."
5,Wow!!!,"I've had this CD for a week now, and I haven't removed it in favor of another CD yet. Thursday, Dashboard, Fire Theft, Coheed & Cambria, Starting Line, yada yada...you're all on hold for now, or at least until I find some reason to stop listing to DD. Beautiful voice, music that makes you move, all 9 tracks long. I can't remember the last time I listened to one CD like this, except for the first time I heard Sunny Day. I'd start spitting out which tracks are my fav, but then I feel like i'm doing some unfair injustice to the other songs, all of which I love. My favorite song on Believing in Ghosts keeps changing. Just take this CD home, and I think you'll experience much the same."
2,Disappointing,"Except for Masonic Inborn (Part 1), this album feels embarrasing. A disappointment from the otherwise brilliant Albert Ayler. The track Island Harvest actually nauseates me, probably because of Mary Maria's irritating vocals. But, as I mentioned before, Masonic Inborn (Part 1) is actually quite an interesting track, but it's not worth buying the album for. Don't make the same mistake I did by starting out with this one. Love Cry or Live At Greenwich Village is much better. It's unfortunate that this was his last album, too."
2,not a beginner's DIY resource,"I bought this book hoping for a detailed how-to before tiling my kitchen and bathroom. Unfortunately, it mostly follows the authors' deluxe slate floor installation (over a ""ditra"" mat that I can't find locally). Beginner questions (like examples of simple layouts, how to choose from the many varieties of thinset available, how to tell if the thinset and grout are the right consistency -- and what you can do if they aren't -- how to handle tiling around tubs, toilets and other fixtures) just aren't addressed. Lots of pretty pictures, which is why I picked it up, I guess."
1,Very disappointed,"When I received it, the ""cupless"" cups looked like they had been cut out with a pair of scissors - literally. Raw, ragged edges, and cut crooked to boot. This is the worst purchase I have made through this site on Amazon. I was very disappointed."
3,Overcoming the Hardships of Teenage Life,"The Crazy Horse Electric Game by Chris Crutcher is a book that many readers can relate to one way or another. After the accident that impaired him physically and mentally, the main character, Willie, had to persevere to reach that high level where he was before the accident. He had everything, then in an instant, he went to nothing. Along the way, the reader is shown how the main character will overcome his disabilities, drugs, prostitution, gangs,and the divorce of his parents. Some of these obstacles are being faced by many teenagers and adults today, and this book is somewhat of a guide to stay away from these harmful and terrible things. Because the book contains so many teenage and adult themes, it is very interesting to most readers because they can make connections to it. His ability to overcome the many hardships he was faced with can empower any reader to do the same."
4,Wining the Hard Way,"The Crazy Horse Electric Game illustrates how a small town sports star, Willie Weaver, becomes unable to handle the changes that take place after an unfortunate accident. We see how Willie finds himself drifting away from his parents and he is faced with his girlfriend going out with another boy. He makes a decision to take drugs, that he is told will make him ""feel better""(65), but what it really does is ruin his life by making all of his close friends and family lose faith in him. He decides to run away to leave what he has not been able to face. Willie finds himself going to OMLC, a school that gives children that don't like or can not handle public schools. The school teaches himself to control his body and become mature enough to handle the world challenges. The Crazy Horse Electric Game taught me that you need to work hard to win."
2,Komelon 100 foot metal tapes breaks easily,I thought this would be equal in quality to a Lufkin. Wrong. It broke the sixth time i used it. Don't waste your money on this tape. Look at other options.
1,used to be a good system,"We've had a three phone setup of this model for about three years. The house phone is the line that gets used least. So what I really don't understand is how I'm buying new batteries for the phones twice a year, because every time we do have a call that's more than 5-10 minutes, the darn battery goes to low battery and drops the call. Mind you, you've got to move fast to pick up a different phone, because once you get the alert that the battery is low you've got maybe 15 seconds before it conks out entirely. I'm searching now for something with some battery life!"
3,CUDDLEBUG TIGHTWAD,"I really like this sticker machine. My only gripe is that it wastes so much of the 18' each time you run something through to apply the adhesive and when you pay a dollar a foot and you waste almost 3 inches each time you use it, the 18 feet isn't going to last very long and you will need to reorder another roll. This makes me hesitant to freely use it on all my cutouts from my CRICUT EXPRESSION without thinking about it and I don't like to think."
3,OK - not as good as I thought it would be.,"Unfortunetly, the author didn't seem very interested in what she was writing. Even her intro was discouraging. I did like the history chapter though.It was somewhat informative although I think the Idiot's book might be better ""if"" you are looking at this type of format to get some general knowledge.If you're looking for an overall description, this is OK - if you're not a Wiccan or Witch. If you are, and have read some other books (Scott Cunningham for example), then you won't gain much from this."
1,Hoo boy.,"I took a gamble and bought this from the $5 bin at Block Buster.Ever since, I have given up gambling for good.Thank you, $5 bin. You have shown me the light."
1,Review,"This movie is neat. The acting blows my mind. Also, rubber monkies and scary. I love when movies go nowhere and the story consists of people in a room somewhere find 2 rubber things and kill them and a man delivers a pizza then a superhero talks to satan and breaks a machine. All in only 2 hours. I was on the edge of my seat. not really. This movie made me attempt suicide."
1,Rip off,"Simply stated this was a total rip off. Could not get anwers from the company or repairs. They left the face of the earth. Buy only name brand, but you need to be very careful there also."
3,As stated,This book was as stated in the ad. It came quickly. The cover was different as was pictured for this book.
5,A Woman Clothed with the Sun - Excellent,"I have read many books on the visitations of The Blessed Virgin Mary, the Mother of Jesus Our Savior, and this one is certainly one of the very best. The accounts are factual and consise. An excellent starting point for any Christian. Highly recommended."
5,Karris Signal & Systems with Matlab and Simulink,"Overall it is a good book. For the program that I am in at the moment, it appears to be geared towards the second portion of the Signal and Systems program. Appears to have a lot of examples in Matlab for the sections covered."
3,"Over priced, poor quality control","Threads not cut cleanly, had to use a thread file before I could install. On second thought I wish I had just stuck a strong flat magnet to the outside of the oil filter. Cheaper, faster, more magnetic surface area. Recommend hobby store."
2,Disappointing Eclectica,"I agree with another reviewer that with this album Minus 8 tries to venture too far out of what they are really good at. Other bands have done a good job fusing different genres. The problem with this album is that Minus 8 didn't seem to have a good idea to be eclectic. Some of the tracks venture to Jamaican/Reggae style with horrible result. Only a few tracks are well done with sublime style Minus 8 is good at. I really like other albums by Minus 8. This one is the worse. If i could sample the tracks, i wouldn't have bought it."
5,Good product,"The end user (mechanic) has not installed this yet, but it seems to be very well built at a pretty competitive price. We are very happy with this device. We are going to use it in an unconventional manner, but I believe it will work well and last a very long time. We are trying this out along side a competitors fairlead, but I think both of these name brand devices will work."
5,Very practical,Interesting book which explains the various stages of one's corporate career. The skills required for each transition is very well explained. A must read for every one
4,"Simple thoughts, big ideas",The book focuses on transitions from one level of leadership to another as you rise in responsibility. It's very rare for managers of people to ever get clear training or direction on how to actually manage people. Usually it's learned as they go. This book describes in clarity the different skills needed at each transition in order to be successful. I would have given 5 stars if it provided more of a clear action plan on achieving success at each level that could be applied to anyone depending on their gaps. Overall very good.
3,Dated and poorly editted,"I found the concepts described in this text to be dated and somewhat out of touch with the demands of today's flexible, high speed organization. While the concepts developed in the book are thought provoking, I found it very frustrating reading because each chapter is written independently and likely by different authors. The format and flow of each of the chapters describing the leadership transitions varies so much that it's hard to make comparisons from one level to the next. A compilation of the transitional indicators would have been valuable - there is one in the first chapter but not in any of the others. If you read it, plan on taking notes on each chapter so you can make sense of it in the end."
5,simply amazing!!,"I've been using this product for years! How ever I have drifted off and tried other serums. Nothing else works as great as this one!! I have curly wavy thick dry hair. After washing and conditioning I apply this product blowdry and flat iron. WOW! It leaves my hair flat smooth and shiney!! Not to mention I fights humidity! I was in horrible humid conditions, and my hair didn't get big! It stayed flat and straight! I'm never trying anything else again!"
3,It's a bit heavy,"I like John Freida regular strength better. This extra strength seems to weigh my hair down, causing greasy strings. I tried applying less but I got the same result. For a long period of time I used Sebastian Laminates. It's a bit priceier(is that even a word?} lol. but is worth the extra $."
1,Not whoat I expected,"This was featured under DVD's I didn't check closely and ended up with a VHS. It ended up in the trash.I should have read more closely, but I didn't suspect to find a VHS in th with the DVD listings."
5,The Boss,Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band is the greastest rock group ever. Rolling Stones are close but in the Bosses shadow.
3,"-Good- Vegas sexploitation, cops & call-girls, piece.","Vegas vice cops, Joe Owens (Sam Jones) and Andrea Thompson (Shannon Tweed), blow open the world of high priced call girls who become the prime suspects in a brutal string of murders. END"
3,OK if you aren't picky,"Good color. Solid material, though you will need to iron it a bit and don't dare fold it again. My largest complaint is that it's lopsided. The angles aren't 90 degrees. It'll look fine flying on a pole, but pinned to a wall it just looks odd."
3,Boring zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I was expecting complete live performances from the bands. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The interviews are too long and repetitive. I was totally disappointed because I thought there would be whole footage of live performances -- in concert-- not just little bits of this and that. I do not recommend it."
2,"One of the weaker Nows, not many great hits","Highlights:14. ""Miss You"" Aaliyah20. ""When I'm Gone"" 3 Doors Down"
3,Where were the good songs?,"I've been collecting NOW CD's since NOW 6. Ever since NOW 11, the CD's have been going father down on my list. I was upset that the only Nas song that I never have heard of was on the CD. I strongly believe that ""I Can"" should have been on NOW 12. It has positive lyrics and an adictive beat. Its the best song I've heard with positive non-violent lyrics on a station for R&B or hip-hop. I also have a suggestion. You should post an online servey for the NOW CD's so the public can choose the songs they like for the next CD. Use the top 100 songs in R&B and hip-hop and songs that people have actually heard of. I don't recomend that you buy the CD.Thank you for your time,Charlie Howerton"
5,One of the BEST,"This is a great, fun DVD that gives you a good 50 minute workout on your Spin bike, PLUS glorious views of the roads and hills of Ireland.It is clearly professionally videotaped without the chatter or shaking of other DVDs.Music is very Irish, upbeat, and in keeping with the level of work.Josh is a very good trainer, tough but positive. No suffering here, just hard work and fun.The heart rate, cadence, and perceived level of exertion does not crowd the screen.My only complaint? I wish it were longer."
5,Well packaged,This is essentially a box of bloodworm gel packaged into easy to use single serve squeeze pouches. It's cute to watch my little frogs munch on it (I try not to think of what it's made of).
2,Too Bitter,The Millstone Columbian roast had a weird bitter taste to it that I did not like.The Folgers Home Cafe Columbian roast tasted much better and I would recommend that.
5,Finally a decent bluetooth mouse!,"I'm a web developer and tried just about all the bluetoot mice out there. Every single one fell short and had huge lag problems. Kensington got it right. No lag, works perfectly with my bluetooth laptop, and it's probably one of the most comfortabe mice I've ever used. The rubber grip really feels nice and keep the hand from cramping."
4,Just needs an on/off button!,"This is a nice big, heavy mouse with a great feel. I like the rubbery side grips. I couldn't find another bluetooth mouse on the market like it. Unfortunately, I thought there was an on/off switch on it. I plan on taking this mouse traveling, so when the left mouse button gets held down in my bag, the batteries will start draining. I am solving this by putting a scrap of paper inbetween the battery contacts for traveling, but I would rather just use an on/off button!"
2,Not for Garment Designers,"This book should properly be titled ""Publish Your Craft Patterns"". There is no information on garment drafting, grading, sizing, and nothing on getting the actual patterns printed. It's a decent book, as far as it goes, but it doesn't go nearly far enough."
1,... Propaganda,"...This novel is your standard Christian fantasy fare- much like the highly acclaimed 'Left Behind' series, it depicts a future where Christians are in a moralisticly simple world clearly divided between good and evil. The story tries to depict a situation where Christian pro-lifers are the only ones to object to involuntary abortion. Speaking as a pro-choice Agnostic, I would also object- so would several athieists I know. The book, like many other Christian fantasy novels, tries to show that the only way to be a good person is to be Christian. This is simply not the case- many people in the past who have fought against tyranny haven't been Christians. Many who fought for the rights we take for granted today (the 40 hour work week, anti-child labor laws, and workplace safety to name a few) were socialists, anarchists, communists and other people most Christians would choose not to associate with. Do yourself a favor- forget this thinly veiled [book] ..."
4,Stellar Entertainment,"This a fascinating historical narrative which reads very smoothly and keeps one's attention throughout with its amusing tangents and vivid descriptions of epic battles, prolonged sieges, and the grisly ends of many a valiant knight. As objective history its major shortcoming is Robinson's complete failure to explicate his sources, and therefore presents his facts as accurate without justification. Still, treated as a novel it is superb, and gives an excellent overview of the Crusades as a whole."
2,rambling but interesting,"I was very interested in the topic when it first started out but midway through the book I felt bogged down with information. While reading the book I got the impression that the author included every shred of information he gleaned in research without regard to its pertinence. the book regained an interesting pace around the 30th chapter, however."
5,Real Spanish,"This is a good book. To really learn the language, you also have to get down to the slang. This is a good guide to Spanish slang. I not only recommend this, but the other 2 in this series as well."
2,Not for non-programmers,"The book Javascript is by all means not a quick fix book if you are looking to learn Javascript in a short period of time. It leaves out a lot of vital details like parameters, objects and things of that nature which made my programs not run effectively when I finished them."
5,GREAT CONDITON,"CAME IN, IN EXCELLENT CONDITIONS (ACTUALLY NEW), CAME IN ON TIME! AND IF YOU REALLY WANT TO READ A BOOK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF DEATH AND DYING TRANSITION THIS IS THE BOOK, I HIGHTLY RECOMMEND IT."
2,Memoirs,I was a little disapointed with this book. Her book on dead and dying gave such hope for those who had lost someone close to her especially given her credentials. This was an autobiography and was dry to read.
2,"Inspiration from a crabby, selfish, person is impossible","The story highlights the author's egomania. She talks about people she's encountered as if she has met the devil himself. The list of her foes include her husband, daughter, husband, as well as basically all nurses and doctors.It was difficult to be inspired by a person encouraging compassion when she had so little for others"
2,"A book for mathematicians, not physicists","Although this book has standard chapters like ""The Wave and Heat Conduction Equations""; ""Foruier tTRansform""; ""Laplace Transform""; ""The Gamma Function""; ""Bessel Functions"", the mathematical language used in this book is not really geared towards physicists. This book is not so readable. I would not recommend this book for non-math graduate students."
3,"Some good material, but . . .","There are a number of good songs on this recording, worthy of being heard. Unfortunately Mr. Bogdan really isn't up to the task. He has an attractive, sweet tenor, but there is a weakness and unevenness in his voice which is evident throughout as well as obvious pitch problems on occasion. Most important, there is very little musical energy and commitment. He really needs to find a good teacher to get him up to speed. His intentions, however, are pure and deserves admiration for that."
4,"Good, but needs some changes","This is a good book: easy to understand and apply. However, some changes are in order. In the Special Topics sectionl, a table presents the thermal stresses and thermal durability of several materials--without specifying the temperature and pressure for the materials. As material properties change drastically at high temperatures, such tables are incomplete without the above information. I hesitated in using the information in my design report, and asked my materials and manufacturing professor about it as well. He agreed that this information must be provided for the table to be of any use. It would also help if you specify the units after presenting an equation. Yes, we can figure it out, but try sitting on your behind for hours on end and having to stop every so often in your design to figure out the units for an equation! Colorful language flows like anything!"
4,Get what you pay for.,"It works and arrived in excellent condition. It is cheap how ever. You get what you pay for, the metal is light and easily bent."
1,I've given up after 3 machines and $55!,"My first appliance worked for about 3 weeks and I was delighted asked if there were lots of problems I was told no. The new one also quit after a short time; this time the fluid wasn't coming through. She suggested I keep the unit primed for at least 4 minutes, which I did in frustration, but still no fluid. How convenient is that?? Now I am on the third unit and after aboutwith the results. Then it quit working; the sonic part quit. I then had to spend another $5 on shipping for a new unit. When I 2 weeks, the fluid doesn't flow. There is obviously a design flaw and a reviewer C. Lichtenberg took his/her apart and apparently found the flaw. This product should be pulled from the market."
1,They get you coming and going...,"It's one thing to give away the razor and make $ off the blades, but the makers of The Buzz have instead chosen to get you both coming and going.If all this gadget cost were $50 + electricity, I could probably live with that. After all, my fancy iron cost about that much, and I shelled out $80 for my garment steamer. HOWEVER, after lightening my wallet to the tune of $50 at a local linen & bath store, I soon felt pretty stupid at the thought of paying $5 for a TINY bottle of cleaning fluid and another $5 for some little absorbent pads for as long as I own this product, and took it back a week later for a refund.If someone discovers cheap substitutes for these consumables (who knows...maybe liquid detergent and paper towels would work?) then I might consider buying one of these. For now, it's easier and MUCH more cost-effective for me to just take any stained clothing to the $1.75 dry cleaner down the street."
5,Awesome Band,Both of this bands CDs are awesome and they are even better live. I just saw them on Friday night at a small show near my home town and they kicked ... I would say they were by far my favorite band there.
2,Disappointing,"After reading Ferrol Sams previous book, I was anxious to read this one. It was really a disappointment, for me anyway. I had so enjoyed the way he wrote in different voices previously, and although there was a bit of it here it was forced and not nearly as good. And then, I'm not crazy about war stuff, so I guess you'd have to factor that in. Overall -- not up to the writing quality I'd expected."
3,Poor remix of an otherwise great album,It's a perfect mystery... why the original version of this psych-rock classic doesn't exist on CD. Seek out the 1972 Virgin Records vinyl copy if you can; it is greatly superior to this version.
5,Wonderful Laymon book!,"I rank this really close to the top of my Laymon book list. I enjoy his writing-although a tad bit far fetched at times. I wasn't sure how I'd like this 1800's book with a western theme. Well, I can't say enough good things about it. Trevor/Willy was a great character, who got himself in all kinds of trouble. I have to say if your a Laymon fan, get your hands on this book it is well worth the hunting for it!"
2,Average Savage,"After reading the synopsis of this book, I got excited. I usually love tales of alternate history and this one had potential. I was disapointed to find that it's only an average read. The Ripper, evil as he is, is portrayed as no more than an English fop. The hero, Trevor, gives new meaning to the word fickle as he tromps from one adventure to another. The whole story seems disjointed. I found myself scanning a lot. Laymon seems obsessed with adolescence and the sexual obsessions thereof. I haven't read a book of his where some teenagers glands weren't percolating with lust. I would only recommend this book to die-hard Laymon or Jack the Ripper enthusiasts."
2,Flawed,We ordered this with express shipping for a childs birthday party. Did not have time to return it after spotting the flaw in the center of the flag. A brown spot was in the middle of the flag as if bleach had been dripped on the black background. The spot is about an inch wide and 4 or 5 inches long. My grandson did not know the difference but my wife and I are not pleased.
1,Very cheap made and tiny,Bad way to blow a few dollars. I bought these and when I opened them up it was so humerous to see how small these things are.
4,theyre good for the price,"they arent big but would be perfect for ravioli (smallest size) dumplings, wontons and periogies (med. size ) and the biggest would be for an empanada or mini pie"
4,Hard to find...,These dough presses are hard to find so I was excited to find them on Amazon. They work great.
1,Cheap!,"Thought this would make periogi making easier, instead it just made a huge mess. The dough split in half instead of folding."
1,exchange this book for a good one,I have researched 1031 extensively ---this is the worst book I have read on the subject-- . I would not buy anything frm this author again. I returned it for my money back---- DONT WASTE YOURS!!!
2,"long, tedious and boring","I didn't enjoy reading this book. Although the story was interesting, it continued to drag on at a slow pace, as the author continued heaping fact upon fact without any action. For a really, fast moving paced book with strong characters anda good plot, try reading Hudson and Hills new novel, A ReasonTo Live. After the first page, you can't put this one down."
1,Don't bother,Stick with the cheap caps that come with the bar tape. These were a HUGE PITA to remove. After using pliars as leverage for 10 minutes they came out. I was pulling so hard I cut the expansion screw in half. Don't bother buying them.
2,Not quite there,"It's attractive, so easy to load, delivers paper well. But the single mounting point is the weakness you'd anticipate. I mounted through gypsum into concrete block. The base is STABLE. But the holder, held to the hidden base by a single small set screw, loosens and droops over time. I wouldn't use a one-sided TPH again."
4,"Ok, but it looks cheap","If you like 80's Italian / Spanish zombie films, you 'll love this. it reminded me a bit of Lenzi's Nightmare City. The scenes with the natives in the jungle are hilarious! Lots of gore and nudity. Don't expect a great story though and the music was taken from Dawn Of The Dead. Only for those who like Zombie flicks like me. AND it 's a region 0 DVD, which makes it easier for me to see because I live in Europe and it's hard to come by things like this that aren't region 1.It you're looking for a fun, gory and mindless movie, this is the one. If you're looking for depth and things to pounder about, don't touch this!"
2,"i love this cheesey gore flick, but it is stupid!!","i love this movie ,so it pains me to give it two stars but really other than the gore and bad acting,this is one of the worst!!! only for gore fans(like me),other wise stay away!!!"
2,This movie really is Hell!,"What can one say about this particular zombie film? Terrible, terrible plotline, poor acting, unsympathetic characters, bad FX... at least it has a few zombies. Most of them look like regular people with jelly on their faces, though, and don't really inspire fear as much as giggles. Buy it if your a zombie movie fanatic, but don't expect 'Dawn of the Dead'. A further note- the 'featurette' on the making of the film, isn't even about this film, but another by the same director (who used different pen names for each of his films)!"
2,Unacceptable for 2007 Silverado,"I had a Torza Top on my 2001 Silverado for several years and loved it. However, for the 2007 (new body style) Silverado it has been junk. While my earlier one stayed nice and tight going down the road, the vinyl on this one flops all over and drives you crazy because you can see it in your rear-view mirror. I took the first one back to where I bought it (not Amazon, but a local dealer), and they tried sealing up the bed so no air got underneath it. That didn't help, so they ordered me a new one under warranty. However, the second one is even worse. I felt bad about repeatedly taking it back to the dealer, so I emailed the company to inquire what the problem is 3 times now over the past 6 weeks, and they won't even respond. There is some kind of mfg issue with this cover, as the vinyl is just way too loose. I'm continuing to try to get this resolved with the company, but for now this product is unacceptable, as is their customer service."
3,Glossy and pretty but lacks substance!,"I remember when the Guinness Book of World Records was more detailed with facts and interesting information. Of course, it is nowhere near as pretty as this addition. I ordered this book for somebody else. I briefly caught a glimpse at it but it's too pretty, colorful, and almost catered to a younger child. Well, maybe that is what will attract the buyers is the colorfulness of it all. It's a hard cover, pretty, and ideal for a Christmas present if that's what it's for especially a younger child or for your library. The price is worth it here."
2,A tragic decline,"No longer intended to be a comprehensive reference, the Guinness Book is now a sort of compilation of interesting superlatives with oversized pictures and many features that aren't even actual records (""Most Overrated Celebrity""). If you're going to do this, why not offer one edition that plays it by the book?So dies a noble institution."
3,If only they hadn't included the Jackson/Timberlake photo,"My kids love the World record books but this one is suitable only for older kids. C'mon folks, leave out the racey photos. A little common sense would have gone a long way here. The cover is way cool, though."
5,Great!,This was a great book! I am finding that when I look to purchase another book to read...that I look under the author Kin Baldwin! She's a great author!
4,GRANDE,"Gran CD, hace mucho tiempo quería comprarlo, gran calidad de sonido. Algunas canciones poco conocidas en mi país pero bonitas. Lo compré especialmente por la canción ROSA, POR EJEMPLO, LOS DOS LEJANOS, muy buenas."
4,Great resource,I used How The Brain Learns for a grad course and found it to be very informative. Its designed well and I continue to use it as a reference.
5,A Born Genius,"The delivery and price of this item were excellent.There are only very brief excerpts of great performances which is very frustrating.Hearing Ashkenazy play only a few seconds of Beethoven or coupled with Perlman just a few bars of the Frank Sonara is cruel.There are complete performances of Chopin Etudes 1 & 2 from opus 10, and the Corelli Variations of Rachmaninoff (a bit slow, his 1957 performance currently available on Testament is better.)with a 25 minute lecture preceding the Rachmaninoff which cannot be skipped. Still, the performances are so transcendental musically it is pricelless.An intimate look at one of musics greatest phenomenoms."
5,Love it!,"I bought this shrink plastic to have a go at making some OOAK custom charms for jewelry. With some light sanding, it readily accepted my marker (sharpie for outlines) and colored pencils (Prismacolor and Crayola). With the amount it shrinks, using a standard paper hole punch works perfect for the charm holes. I do not use an oven to shrink them but a heat gun which worked really nicely! I seal them up with a coat of varnish then a coat of clear resin (Environmental Technology 8-Ounce Kit Casting' Craft Casting Epoxy, Clear) for a shiny, fixed image. They're very sturdy!Just remember to go lighter on the color when drawing your artwork since it will get MUCH darker after it shrinks!"
5,Handy!,"This book is an invaluable tool not only for dressmaking of this era, but for basic tailoring techniques as well. Recommend for any serious seamstress."
3,"Larger print, better binding and it'll get 5 stars.","I've had it a year and the binding is unraveling. The information in this book is very useful. Some improvements to the text, illustrations and binding in the book and it would've made it a 5 star book."
1,monumental disappointment,"As a reader of Ayn Rand's masterpiece, over and over in several sections due to the need to completely understand her exact meaning and appreciate the depth of characters, I found this movie an insult. Obviously there is no way such a novel could be recreated in movie form, but this film went the extra mile to be just terrible. The casting was a joke, as none of the characters represented even an inkling of what you would expect of them, and the acting itself was severely sub-par to say the least. I would expect that even among those that have not read the book, the movie is a let down. I try to find positives in this movie but find none, perhaps the cast should have read the book before trying to act it. After the book I could not wait to see this......save your money."
2,Great Fiction,"I read the book several years ago. I thought the movie made it apparent how absurd the plot of this book truly is. The movie just seemed so unbelievable. It is too bad that so many have used the premise of the book as a basis to form their ""politics."""
4,Amazing how a story written 50 year ago can be so appropriate these days!!,Leaves you hanging. Can't wait for part 2. The story is very good. The acting could be better. would deffinitely go to see part 2.
3,A bit disappointed,"Seems like the actors needed more polish. The dialogue was awkward sometimes. I am a fan of the book and the philosophy and I really wanted to see a good movie, but was disappointed. Perhaps they will work out all the kinks in part 2. I am looking forward to a much better part 2."
1,extremely bad attempt for a movie of a phenomenal book,"I loved the book, could not put it down. I consider it not only a great novel, but also a philosophy, psychology and political science book all in one. That being said - it is difficult to put all of that into a movie without making it over 4 hour long, even though it only covers less than half of the book. Had I not read the book, I would not have understood what was all going on in the movie. My husband, who did not read the book, did not quite catch on to the plot of the movie; I had to fill it in for him. The actors who portrayed Hank, Dagney and James were mediocre, at best; they did not give their characters any depth. Perhaps this book would be better as a 10 - 15 part movie series where the characters can be more fully developed as well as more details of the story line."
4,Atlas Shurgged,How corporations use their influence/control of the elected officials to get what they want. Written many years ago but is becoming reality. Made you stop and think.
4,Atlas Shrugged I,I enjoyed this DVD although it was a little confusing at times. We bought it to refresh our recollection before seeing Part II. The actors changed in the second part.
4,Interesting,I found this very interesting especially after seeing the documentary on the prophecy of Atlas Shrugged. I am eagerly waiting to see part 2 even though the reviews haven't been that good. I have often found that I love movies that the critics hate.
5,Can't wait for Part II,The book was a favorite of mine in college. Glad to see it revived in movie form. The discussion needs to happen or ...??
2,cd SKIPPING,i THINK THE MOVIE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE cd STOPPED working SEVERAL TIMES WHILE WE WERE TRYING TO VIEW IT. tHE BOOK WAS GREAT AND i AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SECOND MOVIE COMING OUT IN A FEW WEEKS. But I won't be purchasing it from Amazon again.
2,Shoud have stayed with original,"The concepts are still the same, but this isn't the type of book that can be made into a two part movie. There is so much that happens and it's because of a culmination of events that can't be accurately portrayed in such a short amount of time. Also, the way they've modernized the story and under-developed the characters really takes away from it. Now people will say that ""you can't get that same feeling with a movie that you do from a book"", but I disagree. Peter Jackson proved that theory wrong with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, capturing the essence of Tolkein's story wery well. And frankly, if you go into it knowing that you're going to fall short, don't bother with it.If you've read the book you know what this story can make you feel and this portrayal simply falls short. Hoping for a better result from the second part, but not optimistic."
3,Seemed to begin in the middle of the story.,"Because the disk needed cleaning badly, although no 'dirty' spots were seen, we had to watch the movie several times. The ending was abrupt. I am hoping Part Two completes the story."
4,A great story on its own,Very well done for a complicated story. I think this would be enjoyable even if you have not read the book...The movie is a great story on its own.
1,Mindless Drek,"Capitalism good, regulation bad. Grunt. Where have I heard that before? I was surprised at the married John Galt boinking Dagny. Not in keeping with a certain political party's ""family values"" agenda."
1,The novel is atrocious: the film even more so,"Hot dog I can't wait for part 2 where we see how the Utopian word full of movers and makers, groovers and shakers fulfill their potential to the brim and the results that come from this world.Wait, it has already been released. Oddly enough it was before Part 1 of the film was even finished. Its called BioShock."
1,Big Disappointment!,"I remember loving Atlas Shrugged when I read it as a very political teenager. I was happy to order the first segment of the movie version. Wow! What a disappointment! No fire in the characters. They sort of whimper along. No energy between them. I won't be ordering the 2nd part, that's for sure. Glad Ayn Rand isn't around to see what has become of her ideas."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"The plot and pseudo science fi writing is so implausible its impossible to even suspend disbelief for a minute. I had to laugh at the scenes where they find some break through technology behind a wall in an old abandoned TRAIN factory in Wisconsin (har) and spend the next several scenes trying to find the dork who invented it, while rather random people seem to omnisciently know the exact next person they should go see. Sort of a weird combination of DaVinci Code and Tucker LOL."
2,I have read book several times but this?????,"First of all, I am a fan of the book having read it many times. And when a movie, film announced, thought to myself, how in the hell is anyone going to get this book into a movie, film?? Well, as it turned out, ""they"" didn't. If you have never read book, this movie is not going to give you any real insight as to what the book is really, really, about and so do not recommend. READ THE BOOK. Ok, so you have read the book..... being a fan, I must admit it was nice to actually see actors with names I know so well and yes, there are some dramatic moments but this film fails in conveying the underlying evil, thought, policies that have such good intentions and wind up killing the goose that lays the golden egg. God I wish there was someway to actually capture the book on film. Perhaps a series of some kind on PBS, like 20 hour shows or something. AND PART 2? Yes, I will see it cause, as I said, I am a fan."
5,Great adaptation,I saw this theaters when it was released and was rather worried they would lose the book to make the movie. Knowing they have to cut and condense quite a bit to put a book on screen; I think they did and excellent job! I have bought this movie for friends and family and all have enjoyed it. Can't wait till the next one comes out!
5,Big Ayn Rand Fan,"OK, this is not the best movie ever made, but I love the spirit of Ayn Rand and her insights on capitalism and self-worth. Be advised there are 3 parts so this just sets up the questions. It's really an important message for the times. So if you're wondering why our country has gone so crazy, there are good answers waiting here. And maybe even surprising ones. Watch and enjoy."
5,Still relevant,A timely and relevant warning for today. Worth watching. Well acted and generally faithful to the book. Better than most of the liberal propaganda garbage that we are innundated with.
3,"Decent Story, Horrible Acting","I haven't read the book, so my comments only reflect on this movie.I almost turned the movie off in the first 20 minutes. I don't mind being dropped in the middle of something and having to use context to quickly pick up the gist of what is going on, but the first 20 minutes of this movie was just short, dull blasts of this and that that I found totally uninteresting. I thought for sure that Dagny would be the antagonist because she seemed so unpleasant and mechanical.I am glad I stuck it out because the story did get interesting, but it never overcame the bad acting. Everybody just seemed so wooden. If this is a passionate commentary about how people lose their drive when there is no reason to strive, why does everyone look so unaffected?"
5,Great!,Great movie that is true to the book. This is a movie that everyone needs to see. The ratings of people here are much more accurate than the liberal media that panned it and prevented it from doing well in theaters.
3,Good Qualtiy,Intriguing MovieIt was an intriguing movie - quality of streaming was excellent.First time using Amazon to view a movie on my computer and it went well
3,Atlas Shrugged,I wasn't as impressed with this movie as it was hyped up to be. I would rate it as fairly good.
3,Atlas Shrugged is OK,"Just OK. Have really really enjoyed the book but the movie not so much. The thing is, that as with most good books, it is hard to make faithfull movies in just one and a half hours or two.I think in this case a mini series would have worked much better.This book defenitelly deserves something that respects all the plots and subplots that Ayn Rand put in."
3,Epic aspirations falling short,"Not a great film. Not a bad film. Certainly unfairly savaged by a large number of critics. I haven't read the book but didn't have any trouble following the fairly simple plot. The complaints of wooden dialog might fairly apply to the occasional line delivery but overall the performances were more nuanced that I had been led to expect. It gave me a bit of the sense of a ""Heaven's Gate"" with epic aspirations falling short but not nearly as far short as ""Heaven's Gate"" fell.I'm sufficiently interested that I'll be there for Part II if it makes it to the screen - and even be a bit disappointed if it doesn't."
1,Atlas Shrugged Part 1,"Look, I know that the mere mention of Ayn Rand inspires rapturous praise from acolytes -- and sends detractors into fits of rage. So I'm not going to debate the principles of Objectivism, nor shall I discuss the literary merits of Atlas Shrugged. No, I'm only going to mention that my hopes for Atlas Shrugged Part 1 -- the first installment of a planned trilogy -- tumbled like the housing project in The Fountainhead. In the year 2016, a group of individualistic industrialists are being targeted by the forces of mediocrity and socialism. It's up to Dagny Taggart and Henry Rearden to save the nation from economic ruin -- and maybe find out who some guy named John Galt is. I found Atlas Shrugged, Part 1 to be a low-budget bore that does little to elucidate Rand's ideas; if you're a fan of the book, however, you may want to give the Blu-ray a shot, as it contains several making-of docs and a commentary track with the filmmakers."
4,Atlas Shrugged part 1 (DVD),The movie was a slow start and because I had read the book I was able to follow it better. It is amazing that this was written in 1957 and yet is so prophetic today. It definitely is something every American should see and try to understand even though the story is deep and involved and somewhat confusing for a mass audience. I am anxious to see part 2.
1,I almost never write reviews...,"but this just had to be said... This is horrible. I won't tell you not to watch it, as I'm a firm believer that there is good in everything, even this--though I will say if you'd like to seek MORE good, READ THE BOOK.It's hard to find a good story. Atlas Shrugged is certainly that, but it is also much, much more. Ayn Rand's ability to come up with a story is marvelous, but it is the genius of HOW she tells a story which is absolutely remarkable. This genius is obliterated completely to shreds in the movie.I understand the limitations of the screen format, but if such an injustice could have been foreseen in the slightest, then this movie should have not been attempted.I would suggest listening to Atlas Shrugged the audio book recorded by Christopher Hurt. Alone, he manages to out-perform every actor in this movie."
1,"Great book, terrible movie","I loved Atlas Shrugged, and everything Ayn Rand did with it. This movie was abysmal, the actors were terrible, it was set in the wrong time period, and every moment of the movie was cheesy at best. I hope they don't bother to make parts 2 and 3."
3,Just OK,"It was OK, but a bit weird. Not what I was expecting. I've definitely seen better, but I guess I shouldn't have expected too much from a movie based on Ayn Rand's writing."
3,"Should be titled Atlas Shrugged, the Cliff Notes","I would love to see Atlas Shrugged as an HBO or Showtime series, e.g. 15 90-minute episodes. Often the movie felt like a political propaganda film. But the Dagny and Rearden actors were great, and the plot didn't drag; it moved along pretty well. Unfortunately the time constraint meant that a lot was cut from the novel. Dagny's meetings with Robert Stadler and Hugh Akston, which are dramatic and memorable in the novel, are rather ordinary and boring in the movie. I must admit that after being familiar with the novel for 40 years, I can't say how the movie would look to someone who hadn't read the novel. But there is the feeling of Cliff Notes, that the movie touches upon this scene and that scene, with not enough time to draw us in. Not a bad movie, pleasant to watch, but I really think Atlas Shrugged should be more like a 20-episode series."
2,Just Okay,This is a tough movie to make from such a great book. It was a pretty cheap production with bad acting and cheap scenes.
1,I would give it zero stars if i could,"This book is the most disjointed attempt at explaining Islamic law. The book is full of non-sequitors, gaps in logic, and at times just plain bad writing."
4,Works Most of the Time,"This item is a silver bullet for removing yokes, but it does work really well 8 out of 10 times. I use this item several times per week, and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
1,doesn't work,this product is a complete waste of money! use your hands people! i use large eggs and the product brakes the yokes and the whole thing goes through it. i hate it!
4,Have to disagree with the naysayers,"This book was a delight from beginning to end. I am on a quest for excellent historic fiction, and this book certainly fills that bill. The author is fast becoming one of my favorites. Her attention to historic detail and the life she breathes into her characters makes what I've read so far (Slammerkin, Life Mask, The Woman Who Gave Birth to Rabbits) difficult to put down. Subsequent to reading Life Mask, I was prompted to do my own research on the central characters...they were that interesting.Perhaps some people were put off by the lesbian story line? If you have no sympathy for the trials and tribulations in Anne Damer's love life, then yes, this book is not for you. If you don't catch (and believe) one central theme that true love makes no distinctions when it comes to gender, background, or looks and that it is worth waiting for, then this book will indeed be ""a bore."""
4,Enjoyable Read,"I am finding this a very enjoyable read - interesting characters and history. However, the person who proof-read or edited this for the Kindle should be ashamed. There are multiple typos throughout which are rather distracting. A dog called Fidelle being called Fiddle, the phrase ""ruin another man's life"" reads ""ruin another maris life,"" and so many other examples."
1,If you love Jesus,This book ruined my freakin childhood! If you love Jesus you will never buy it (unless its for a good laugh or ritualistic book burning).PS there was no negative stars otherwise I would have given it a -57.
1,A harmful influence,"I was seven years old when someone gave this book to my mother. I was a crazy fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and had a very nice collection of the original 80's action figures and this awesome giant Donie stuffed animal. Because of the influence of this book on my mother, most of my TMNT collection was sold in a garage sale. I was heartbroken and distraught. I know I'm not the only one that had to suffer the war against so-called 'unBiblical' toys, movies, and games. This book has nothing but far-fetched theories that only hurt our childhood."
1,wow,"I acquired this literary goldmine the other day and I must say it has become very precious to me. No matter how trying life becomes, I can always open to any page of 'Turmoil in the Toybox', and everything is allright for a while. Bravo, Mr. Phillips for bringing laughter into so many of our lives. I must admit that I was originally disgusted by the statements in this book, until I shortly realized that only ultra-religious crackpots could possibly take it seriously."
3,Who could ever tire of Loreena's angelic voice?,"This is but another Loreena McKennitt piece of music where you have to ask yourself, ""How is her voice so beautiful?"" However, I still think Book of Secrets is by far her best piece of work. This cd is very good and, as always, the songs are made more beautiful by her exequisite voice; I just didn't think the songs themself were as pretty as those in Book of Secrets."
3,Filtering almost unnoticeable,"If you have a low-frequency audio problem that you can actually hear, this product won't fix it. Its affect is barely noticeable. Although it does not appear to degrade the audio, so I keep it online just in case. For me, it's to audio what an AC surge protector is to power. It doesn't do anything but it's good to have it there just in case."
1,Absolute disaster,"The entire quality control team must have been on vacation when this one went out the door. I concur with the other reviews. My specifics:1. more coffee lands on the counter than in the cup (hint: I removed a rubber seal from the lid and corrected this problem).2. I'm now up to 8 ""hits"" before the coffee is brewed3. Pretty carafe, but the coffee is never hot, especially since it only brews for about 15 seconds at a time before stoppingI would sure like to hear from someone at B & D as to how this one happened!"
1,Worst coffee maker,"This is the worst coffee maker I've ever bought that carried the Black & Decker name!!!! The coffee does not get hot enough, the pot pours ever so slowly, it dribbles coffee on the counter top, I can't empty the last cup from the pot without removing the lid, plus the lid is very hard to remove and put back on. If anyone knows a way for me to return this pot and get a refund, please let me know."
1,cold coffee,"If you like cold coffee, this model is for you. The coffee doesn't brew hot enough to stay hot in the carafe. We have to heat our coffee in the microwave then pour it back into the carafe for it to stay hot. When someone else makes an under the counter coffee maker that works as it is suppose too, I will buy it :)"
5,Got to be one of the best cds I've ever heard!!,"This will probably be the best ...you ever spent. This cd is worth every penny. As you listen through each song, none of them are bad. You really have to look past the much overplayed ""Wasting my Time"" (Not saying its a bad song, just overplayed) Every track is completly different so there is tons of variety!"
4,German Hard Rock!,"Along with the Scorpions and Accept, Kingdom Come was a hard rock band from Germany. They sounded similar to Whitesnake in that they were very Led Zeppelin influnced. Although they didn't rip off Zeppelin so much as the aforementioned band. The songs are hard, catchy and a little commercial, but still they were great rock 'n' roll. And although their success was short-lived, Kingdom Come made a large impact on the face of commercial hard rock. This is similar to the Scorpions and Whitesnake. If you like either of those bands, you will like this."
5,good bug protection - smells nice,"I practically live outside during the summer months so I need protection from bugs. I like that this is natural, moisturizing and doesn't smell like pesticide."
3,Caravelli CD,This item is as described & I'm pleased both with it & the seller's quick mailing & good packaging!
5,"Great bags, value","I use these to keep heavy and sharp tools organized; good large zippers, solid construction and the size is great for a variety of tools."
4,Works as advertised,"Nothing remarkable to say. As the title says, this heart rate monitor works just like it says. This is the first heart rate monitor I've ever owned, so I don't really know how it compares to similar products. So far, no problems. It seems like it has a fairly full set of features, and the controls seem fairly intuitive."
3,Timex Heart Rate Monitor,"The Monitor does exactly what it says it will do. All features work fine. Here is the down side. I workout 5 - 6 days a week. 1 to 1.5 hrs at a time, Zumba, jog and bike ride. I did not need a 100 lap type. All I really needed was a Heart rate and calorie count. So, I use one lap on the monitor. That's it. I really don't get what I am looking for as far as when I lift weights or Yoga for instance. I guess I am saying that I bought more than I needed. Oh well, I'll get another one, cause I don't think I can send back. But it is nice. Signed, I didn't need that much."
3,Little hard to figure out!,"Purchased it for my husband, it was a little hard for him to figure out, and since he is an engineer it must be hard for anyone to figure out, also a little hard to get around chest area. Other wise a very good product."
5,"Finally, An Easy Way To Uncover Your Past Lives!","I've been teaching past life classes for years. Occasionally, you run across a student that has a ""block"", they just can't get through to their past. I know it's frustrated me as well as others.Finally, here's a book that gives you not one, but MANY ways to uncover your past lives. My personal favorite is the tick-tock method that is virtually foolproof and something I have never seen in print before.Richard Webster's experience truly shines through in this book. If you've ever wondered about past lives and wanted to do it on your own, here's the book.I highly recommend it."
4,I like this book,I like this book as it is well written and I will recommed it to someone who is interested in this subject.
3,Practical Guide to Past-Life Memories,"I read the book and was interested -- the author did manage to avoid too many mentions of Edgar Cayce and Shirley MacLaine, both of whom are instant turn-offs for me when the subject of reincarnation come up. However, most of the twelve methods are basically self-hypnosis. I was hoping for a little more than that. It's not a thumbs down but it's not a perfect 10 either. I rate it average."
3,Good Read,Loved this book. It has easy examples to use. Good combination of regression scripts to use and case examples. The book moved along in an enjoyable pace!
1,Same as buyer below,DEFINETLY! another Amazon untrue sales pitch. I buy from Amazon alot and lately there are so many mistakes on this website I am afraid to order anything from Amazon anymore. No bulbs included but was listed in black and white in the description that bulbs were included. Dont buy theses. Bulbs arent included. Go to your local dealer. They will be chaper than here on Amazon.
1,NO BULBS INCLUDED,"This states that the bulbs are (included). There were no bulbs shipped with the lights. I emailed Amazon and they shipped out new set of lights and they did not include bulbs, so now I have two big boxes to get returned. The lights themselves were nothing very special, if the bulbs are not included in the price then they are not worth the money. The only thing that made them cheaper then Home Depot was that you did not have to buy bulbs. I buy from amazon often but this product is a waste of money, save the time of returning it and skip this one."
3,Any Problems with this DVD???,"Its an enjoyable opera, but I had to watch it on my computer as my RCA television with built in DVD player couldn't read the disc. The message kept coming back Wrong Disc Type and it would spit the disc back out. Has anyone else encountered this problem?"
3,Best Of???,"All the songs here are great Jackyl classics, but how this album can be called a ""Best Of"" is a joke. There's more good stuff missing off this ""Best Of"" than is on it. Give this CD a miss unless you've never heard of Jackyl before and want an introduction - trouble is ... this introduction will have you looking for the original albums and you'd be much better off going for them in the first place: might cost a few $'s more, but it's worth it."
1,Did you get the letter offering the book & DVD for just $7?,"The letter that arrives in the mail offers this book, a DVD, and an offer to become part of A.D. Kessler's ""Financial Success Dream Team"" for only $7. The $7 is the shipping on the book and DVD. To become part of the ""Dream Team"" you actually have to shell out THOUSANDS of dollars - and you won't get to work with A.D. Kessler ... just some guy or gal on the phone. With who knows what kind of experience.How is THOUSANDS for advice realistic for someone looking for a ""no money down"" deal? The answer is that it isn't. A.D. Kessler is just looking to make a buck or two.I would recommendInvesting in Real Estate 4th Editionby Andrew McLean and Gary W. Eldred instead. (ISBN: 047132339X) It costs only a little more than that $7 you'd waste to get a sales pitch to spend a whole lot more. And, it is much more useful. Tells you exactly how to calculate whether a particular real estate purchase would benefit you or not.Choose wisely. Happy investing!"
3,slow mail,We paid extra to have the book in 2 to 3 days. It took 10 days before we received the book. Should have just paid the standard postage rate...
5,White Eyes... finally,"Finally, something worth while outta the No Limit camp.. Check out War, tight as hell.. Hustler... Shake A Lil SOmethin, Fire, Good Life, Ball Like Us, Forgive Us, Smoke On, Never Slippin, Friday, Ballers and you'll see why this is one of the more solid cd's that's come outta NL in a long while.. only one complaint, not as many gangsta songs as Thuggin, but this has got everything, clubs, r&b, bounce, gangsta hits, street bangers, and some real life stuff too, forgive us, ya gotta check that one out, that's some super serious stuff"
2,No Limit Fan,well first i would like to say i love No Limit they off da hook but lately they have been weak they dont have most the old crew like fiend snoop mystikal and so on and we all know about mac and c-murder to bad but when they get out (if) they should be tight as f**k but thanks to P they sound more like cash money and not the real no limit and wats wit da New No Limit why change whats worked fo years it was mb to change lables and the one song by magic is not even on here whats up wit that? if anyone shares my views write me back.
2,Not As Expected,"This cd is not what i expected. i wanted another hard cd where he rapping about the streets. on this cd he rapping about the clubs. His second album ""Thuggin"" is whay better.The hottest song on the cd are ""WAR"" and ""WHAT U GONNA DO"". his first video WHAT is not on the cd. there is a song called WHAT in this cd but the lyrics and beat are completely different then on video on BET. Burn this cd , dont buy it"
5,Chanticleer,"I purchased this DVD as a gift, and was pleased with how soon it arrived and the excellent condition of it."
3,Reptomin Selctafood,"Well , the shipping was fast , I got what I ordered . The thing is , and I am not sure who's fault it is , but , when I opened the container , there was a dead fly in the shrimp section. I am a little worried that I might find more.So I got my stuff in time , got what I ordered , the only prob was the dead fly I found..So there you go , hope it helps!"
4,Doesn't solve the problem,"The mouse is about as comfortable as a regular mouse. At first, it did relieve the icy cold feeling in my hand from constant use but eventually the feeling came back. I use a mouse about eight hours a day for cad work and was hoping this would solve the problem of that icy cold feeling, numbness and pain--but it did not. I rate it 4 stars because it is no better and no worse than a regular mouse."
1,Great idea but not a good fit,"I read both the positive and negative reviews for this item before purchasing it, and felt that the good far outweighed the bad, so I tried it. Unfortunately, I found that the main fault mentioned in all the bad reviews applied to me - it is just too large for my hand. My hands are about average size for a woman, but this mouse really felt way too big. Also, I found that the keys required too strong of an effort to click (another problem mentioned in several negative reviews I read). For someone who is looking for relief from carpal tunnel, this was no better than a regular mouse and worse than some I've used with a lighter touch required. It really was disappointing to me because it seems like such a great idea - the vertical placement of the arm really did feel better than a regular mouse; maybe if it were offered in more than one size that would be great, but they would still need to adjust the touch on the keys for it to give any real relief."
2,"Helped my wrist, but after going through 2 broken units I'm looking elsewhere","The product was definitely helpful in easing my numbness and discomfort associated with my carpal tunnel syndrome. It was very comfortable to use and it required very little time to get used to. My only warning is about the quality of the product. The first unit worked well for about 3 months. I dropped it about a foot above my desk and it broke. So I bought a second unit right away. Unlike the first unit, the pointer was not precise (i.e., it jumped). Yes, the computer was the same and I did try all settings. I could not use the second unit. I went back to my standard optical mouse for awhile but my carpal tunnel has since worsened. I'm trying out other vertical/natural mice from other manufacturers."
2,"Awkward mouse, helped my wrist but hurt my hand","I tried this device for about 3 months a while back. It helped me at the beginning by reducing the tension on my wrist, but then it began generating pain along the edge of my hand, so I stop using it.The idea is interesting and valid, the natural position for the wrist is sideways and not twisted down.The problem is that there is no base to rest the lower edge of the hand, so that part gets stressed out.Of course everybody's ergonomics needs are not the same, but I recommend instead the3M Ergonomic Mouse SMALL/MEDIUM, which have been working great for me (3 years now)."
4,"As advertised, though a little spendy.","The muscle between my thumb and forefinger hurts sometimes now, but at least it's not the tendons in my wrist and forearm. The pain was totally gone a week or two after beginning to use this mouse. Though more than I wanted to spend on a mouse, it serves its purpose and is probably a bargain for the R&D costs involved on Evoluent's end."
5,High quality mouse and helped relieve my symptoms,The evoluent mouse is a quality product. I believe the design of it has helped me with my repetitive stress symptoms.
2,Wish I could say I liked it...,"After reading all the other reviews and doing some research, I was really hopeful that this mouse would help my hand, but instead it made it worse. In using this mouse my hand seems to tense up more than with a regular mouse, especially at the base of my thumb, which is where the pain is. After a week of use my thumb and hand hurt much more than usual."
5,Easy on the wrist,"Works as described, easy on the wrist. Takes getting used to, though. Light. Two buttons and scroll wheel work without driver in Win environ."
1,crapped out,"For this price, I am appalled that the mouse is essentially unusable after three months. The scroll wheel is jammed up, and cleaning doesn't help. I feel ripped off."
1,Worked great (for about a month)!,"I perform CAD at least 8 hours a day and needed something to combat wrist pain. This was the solution for about a month. The resolution function is great, it's comfortable, etc. but I don't think it's built to last. My scroll wheel stopped working. The click function of it still works, but the scroll does not. I uninstalled/re-installed/updated the driver with no luck! I am VERY disappointed because it's expensive. I've contacted Evoluent tech support, so I'll see what happens next. Maybe it's just not built for the kind of 'abuse' I put it through..."
3,"Bad drivers, good build quality, comfortable","If you buy this mouse, download X-Mouse Button Control. The evoluent drivers are junk. For some reason, a random person giving away free mouse drivers does a better job than the company that sells the mouse.Other than that, the mouse is pretty good. I'd prefer wireless, but it's not a huge deal. There's a switch on the bottom to change the DPI that I find pretty useless. It did kind of help with my wrist problems, but seeing a good doctor helped more. It's comfortable, it's got a back button on the thumb, and the wheel is good.The only downside is other people have trouble acclimating to it. Don't put this in a public or shared workstation. It helps if you don't want someone else using your computer, I guess :)"
3,Over-rated,"This is a good book - but by no means a classic. It is perfect for its target market - geeks who don't know about business and business value and just want to read a summary of information available from more authoritive sources.Better books include ""Managing the Professional Service Firm"" or ""Secrets of Consulting"" by Weinberg."
2,Discouraging,"I was disappointed in the contents of the book. Although some of the information was helpful, each chapter ended with how difficult it was to be an independent IT Consultant. Also, the book is written from a UK perspective and does not focus on many aspects that are specific to the US, including new legislation (SOX) or sub-contracting."
4,"Very Nice, with a couple of weaknesses","Heartcore continues in Mr. Rosenwinkel's ""tradition"" of exploring new territory.This CD has a compositions similar to say, Joe Zawinul's style - blocks, or segments of ideas linked together nicely. There is a good dramatic sense in his composing - the songs and the improvisations have a ""natural"" structure, and even when the song is has a long 2 or 3 chord ""vamp"" the song still has motion, and doesn't get stuck or feel monotonous.My only complaint is the drum machine feels - they have a similarity throughout the CD - a sort of slowish rock/rhumba/cha cha/what-have-youtype of feel and could use a little more variety. I would prefer a real drummerto the machine.As a longtime listener to jazz (35 years and counting) I am always starved for good new music - and Heartcore does the trick. This CD (and all his others) should be in any ""modern"" jazz listener's collection..."
3,Tamaguchi,"Price was right. Shipping was fast. However, the cost of shipping almost doubled the price of the toy, thus making it not worth buying on line."
4,Good memory!,"While not the fastest memory on the market it is plenty fast enough for a budget card. It has given me NO problems since I bought the cards and camera in April, '07. I have shot probably close to a thousand pictures and the cards are great!"
2,Eh,"That is what I thought after I was done reading it. I never really bought her voice throughout the book. I enjoyed getting a picture of what a rich woman in 19th century NY could and could not do and at times it was quite dramatic following Ms. Chance's fiction character. But the ending, it was just too much. Whatever sympathy I had for the characters was gone completely. I felt a bit cheated because they turn out to be completely different people (morally) that they were portrayed."
3,Pretty interesting,"I'm glad I read it, but it was hardly worth buying. I don't recommend it to any of my friends."
3,great book for weekend reading,"Nashville City Paper BookClub Column - May 27, 2004An Inconvenient Wife by Megan Chance (Warner Books) is ideal for devotees of historical fiction. Lucy Carleton wants to be an asset to her husband in society but instead becomes dependent on something only Dr. Victor Seth can cure - a plot perfect for fans of both Edith Wharton and Nora Roberts.Saralee Terry Woods is President of BookMan/BookWoman Books in Nashville, and Larry D. Woods is an attorney"
5,Kid's approve...,"My children are 7 & 9 they love this movie. Keep in mind the word WARS is in the title....that denotes fighting. It's not gorey, it's defense against darkness, using force! Using your imagination you can find theology in the plot....just as you can with Chronicles of Narnia. I'd say it works for the 7 to 12 age range quite well. My daughter loved the ""Learn to draw and Angel"" tutorial segment, she did quite well too! The cartoon also uses some contemporary Christian Music...the kids loved that they recognized the music too. Music videos are included in the bonus features...Mom liked that part!"
1,Really just a fighting DVD,"My seven year old said said that this wasn't a good movie for our church library since all it contains is fighting and very little (if any) Christian values. I agree, I watched to the end hoping for something redeemable. There was nothing Christian about it except for the Christian rock musical accompaniment."
4,Received item in a quick manner,I've been taking these softgels daily since I received them.Dr Oz suggested these on his show to stay healthy on the inside.
2,Disappointed with Dr.Oz,"I think this was a gimmick. Has not work for me in any slimming at all.Dont see any result, I will be more careful to believe everything Dr. Oz endorses."
5,It's Everywhere! It's that good!,"So, I love this soundtrack. Now I hear it on trailers (Master and Commander, Cinderella Man, even Racing Stripes). Finally, after hearing it play on Sunday NFL football, we know this soundtrack has reached its peak. A very moving score."
5,Amazing,"Truly one of the best film scores ever recorded. Consistent theme throughout, though it doesn't get boring. Beautiful and moving---whether you are a fan of sci fi or not. A great gift for anyone that loves music that gives you chills and can bring a tear to your eye."
2,I don't like the feel I much as I use too,"Hanes seems to have changed something, these are thinner and don't feel as nice as my older pairs of these. I like the Docker's I got better."
4,nice,keeps everthing where it need to be. very soft and the waistband does not make those deep groves in your sides.
4,One Star Drop-off,"This is a great book but I was disappointed by the fact that the author seemed a little prejudiced against Englishmen. Whenever someone from my home country does something stupid he's called an 'Englishman' - whenever he does something good he's called 'British'. Few other immigrants are referred to by their former nationality - Germans, Swedes, Danes, etc. - just the 'stupid' English. Otherwise, as I say, a great book which I would have given five stars, but - you know."
5,Something we knew about hundreds on thousands of years ago,"Way to go Roy! Britain's best songwriter has still got it, and he proves he does with his epic new single. A multipart piece from different perspectives of people involved in the imperialist foreign military actions perpetrated by the USA, The Death Of God features Harper's trademark guitar, creative vocal arrangements, and cutting lyrics. This is some of Roy's most compelling work in the last few years, and I would recommend checking it out. The premise, I would say, is similar to Dylans ""With God On Our Side,"" insofar as the Bush Administration has claimed to have God on its side, as it were, but when the bottom fell out of the ridiculous war in Iraq and there were no WMD to be found, (in Roy's view) God was wrong, and he ""fell out the sky."" Great stuff, and it's a good thing Roy has his own label because a big one probably wouldn't allow this kind of sharp commentary. (...)"
4,Food For Thought,"If you are looking for an entertaining DVD about Jimi's music you are wasting your time and money. However, if you are looking for a thought provoking informative alternative viewpoint as to what really happenned to Jimi on the last day of his life, then check this out.The people interviewed here are for the most part credible, and they really make you think. Granted, the actor they use to portray Jimi is awful, but, there are issues raised here beyond the hype that could definetly be true and should be examined.Decide for yourself."
4,Impressive,"Haven't yet read through the whole thing, but its a good book. My friends have already borrowed it, and it provides with enough general info with certain details that you feel like you know football to a certain level. Would definitely recommend."
1,If you know nothing-DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"Don't get me wrong... I love football. I bought this book because I want to know MORE about the game. Perhaps the reason I hated this book is because I bought it on my Kindle. Flipping around is difficult on a Kindle. If you read from page one on, you will see that Howie doesn't start from the basics, meaning the positions of the players. He explains the game referencing players positions. If you don't know the positions, it's impossible to follow. It's not that entertaining either. It's a bit dry. Don't waste your money. Try Football 101 if you want to start from the basics, it costs 99 cents. From there move up to this book but I must warn you, Dummies need to steer clear of this book."
1,Poorly Written For Beginners and Degrading To Women,"I was very disappointed in this book. Instead of progressing to a new topic by building upon topics already presented earlier in the book, this book skipped around to the point where I was confused and annoyed and finally gave up reading it about 2/3 of the way through.In addition, Howie Long seems to imply that the only reason a woman would read the book would be to try to impress a boyfriend or spouse. I found that offensive, since I am a woman who wanted to read the book purely out of interest in learning more about the game for the sake of the game and not to impress anyone. What century are you living in, Howie?"
4,Wow! Draw my own PAC MAN??? Neat!!,I almost passed this game up thinking it's another lousy Pac Man game like Pac n Roll. I hated Pac n Roll because of it's difficulty with the controls and it was in 3D which I found out I hate.PAC PIX is not in 3D and you get to draw your Pac Man and watch him move and eat up the monsters. Really neatest thing I ever saw!!I'm on Book 1 level 11. It is such an addicting game with high level of frustration as you go into higher levels but I'm enjoying it and not giving up!!This game is all stylus usage! No buttons to use. Glad I got this game! Should be fun for all ages.
4,A break from Bossa Nova,"I've owned this controversial album for years and have always enjoyed it. The arrangements are interesting, with alot (sometimes too much) back-up from vocals and strings. However, it seems to me that Stan Getz puts more into his playing on this disc than he does on the formulaic bossa nova albums of the same period. Worth the small price just to hear Stan's version of ""Blowing in the Wind""."
2,Skip it.,This plot is irrelevant to the whole of Deep Space Nine. It is obvious the series creators were running out of ideas and were grasping at straws to try and make the series last a few more seasons.
4,Streaming worked fine,"I watched this series when it first ran, so this watching was fill in for blank periods in newer shows."
2,"Nice look, poor fit","Perhaps a pediatrist who knows better designed this shoe's insert, but I hated it. It felt half-there. There was good cushion at the back and felt like none at the front - like those ""orthotic"" deals that come on infomercials. Well, it didn't feel good on my tender forefoot so I sent them back.On the other hand, the shoe looked great. I guess, if you really want it, shoe can go shopping for some Dr. Scholl's."
3,Does anyone proofread anymore?,"This was a rollicking fun read, EXCEPT for the unconscionably numerous typos and completely wrong words! (nun for rum, for example) Perhaps I am overly annoyed by such sloppy publishing practices, or maybe I should volunteer for the job."
3,Great pics,This was enjoyable but it just didn't keep me wanting to read more. I like the premise of it. I thought it was thorough. I don't know what I was expecting so perhaps it was more 4 stars.
1,Don't buy from Barry Farms!,I bought this and other products from Barry farms. One bag was mislabeled (labeled as fructose but contained some type of flour) notified the company. The said I was lying and refused to replace the product. Buy at your own risk! They do not guarantee the product is what the label says!
5,The many doors of perception,"This is one of the most interesting books I've ever read. At first, I was convinced that McKenna must be insane (obviously too much shrooming); but then I began to wonder if it was us (20th century American society) that are the insane ones. He truly sees the world from a unique perspective.I must admit that the book piqued my curiosity...and yes...at least for me...it was a mind-expanding/life-changing experience. But, I am a college physics instructor in my 30's whose sole motivation was consciousness and spirituality. I'm glad I never took ""the voyage"" in my teens or twenties, before I had an idea of who I am and what is important. I have a feeling it would have been very destructive."
1,smart golf,it was not the book i was looking for. no real instruction.i was very unhappy with book i wasted my money
2,Seems like an afterthought,"Some of the songs on this CD are good (Feel So Numb, Iron Head) but most are pretty ordinary. Also, the CD is really short after you filter out the interludes, intros, etc. I was pretty disappointed though after Hellbilly Deluxe was so good. Maybe wait for the next ""real"" Rob Zombie CD to come along, since this one is almost like an EP."
3,"OK, Not Zombie's best work.","This has a few good songs on it: Iron Head, Feel so Numb, Scum of the Earth. The rest of it... eh, I could leave it. Most of the songs are only 1 to 2 minuets long. After listening to it, I'm glad I didn't buy it."
5,Better than Hellbilly Deluxe,"Get this cd!! It's amazing. I'm a huge fan of Rob Zombie, and this is his most confident work to date. The absolute standout tracks are Never Gonna Stop, I Feel So Numb, Scum Of The Earth, and Ironhead. But all the tracks are awesome. Not one filler track in the bunch. His first cd called Hellbilly Deluxe was amazing, and i didn't think it was possible to top it, but he did. The songs are even more catchy. The level of energy in these songs is incredible, especially in Never Gonna Stop and Feel So Numb. Buy this cd! I give it six stars."
1,What Does He Do?,"Why is this guy popular?. I'll admit, ""Dragula"" and ""Living Dead Girl"" were pretty decent songs, but everything else he has done is the same thing. How long is this 'horror' schtick going to go on?. The weird hair?. The ghastly make-up?. The growling singing?. What does he do?. Nothing. Just another Alice Cooper fan who is trying to copy him. A guy who doesn't know when to stop and do something else. The schtick is old. Rob is a big sell out. He always moans about modern horror, but if you pay attention, a lot of his songs appear on the soundtracks to modern horror films. Whatever Rob. Time to expand dude. Do something different."
3,What to expect from the Clean Version,"This is an interesting Edited CD, mainly because none of the actual lyrics have been edited. There wasn't originally any cursing on this CD to begin with (except for a brief sample that says ""shake your...proper,"" which has been left in). There WAS originally some nudity in the packaging, which has been blurred out in this version.So the only actual editing in this CD takes place in the packaging. This seems really odd... but remember, the Parental Advisory labels read ""Explicit CONTENT,"" not ""Explicit Lyrics"" - so it kind of makes sense."
3,Zombie rules... but how 'bout some more MUSIC?!?,"Immediately bought this cd after hearing ""Feel So Numb"" on the radio (as I've adored RZ for a long, long time) and was actually pretty disappointed with the cd. This cd was more like a Halloween ""scary sounds"" soundtrack with a few really great songs thrown in for good measure. ""Scum of the Earth"" wasn't even *NEW*, it was on the MI:2 soundtrack among various other things, and if you took out all of the filler sound effects you'd probably have about 20 minutes worth of quality music.Yeah, the cd will stay in my collection because it *IS* Rob Zombie and Hellbilly Deluxe needs a shelf-mate, but I definitely forsee the cd getting *VERY* little time in my cd player... I mean, if I *wanted* to listen to old monster movies, I'd turn on the Sci Fi channel. I buy a *MUSIC* cd because I want to listen to *MUSIC*..."
4,Homogenized Zombie,"Although I rated this CD four stars, it does have a tinge of the studio production CD to it. I liked both White Zombie CD's and Rob's Hellbilly deluxe. This CD just seems too polished. Like ELO meets White Zombie. The jagged edges are gone. But for all that, I still like the music and still would recommend the CD to anyone that is a fan of the Zombie sound."
5,Excellent Cd,"This cd was great. It was just as good in not better than Hellbilly Deluxe. I love the songs: Feel SO Numb, (Go to) california, Demon Speeding, and Scum of the Earth. Overall this cd kicks ass. It is a must have for any Rob Zombie (or just plain metal fan) BUy this."
2,"I'm sorry, but this was truly a disappointment","I loved Hellbilly Deluxe but this was just awful in my own opinion. There were a few catchy songs like ""Iron Head"" which featured Ozzy and ""Feel so Numb"" which is hard to resist, but I just failed to buy into this album. Obviously Rob is exploring new sounds and exceeding the boundries, but to me, this is nothing like any Zombie. It seems more like a dance cd with its techno influenced backgrounds. There are very few songs where the bands just comes right out and do what they do best, play the damn instruments the way they were meant to be played. There is nothing more I can add except I am a bit let down by this release, as soon as I put this album on I turned it off in disgust after one time through. After making numorous efforts to buy into it, I just can't. End of story, I'll just have to go back to Hellbilly Deluxe"
1,RIP-OFF!!!,Do not buy either volume of this dvd. It is complete and total false advertising. Lousy home video of Mardi Gras' crowded streets!!! Buyer beware!!! Complete theft here!!!
5,A wonderful guide to the Hope films,"OK, we all know about the negatives in Hope's later work. But read and refer to this book and you will be able to pick the films that will tickle your funny bone again and again. I grew up on these films but the book is solid with interesting observations and facts. Example: ""Where There's Life"" was unknown to me. Not any more. Neibaur also doesn't let his admiration for Hope get in the way of his evaluations of the films. Finally, you get lots of information about the films and the role each played in Hope's career, as well as information about other actors. I read the book in one night and keep it handy as the best reference you can have on Hope. Woody Allen once said he copied from Hope shamelessly. It is obvious he wasn't just saying that when you examine the book and the films. Use this book to double your pleasure of seeing Hope at his best and learning loads of interesting facts about his career and each film."
2,Cheap lock,I bought these locks to use as temporary locks for my new homes while they were under construction. The price is good enough but one of them has broken after only about 3 weeks. They suit my purpose fine but I would not use them for any permenant locks. BTW they key like a Kwickset lock.
2,misleading title,"It's a good enough selection of songs, but I guess Southern Rock means anything south of the North Pole, since there is music by Free (British), Nazareth, (Scottish), BTO (Canadian) and some American music that can hardly be considered as ""Southern Rock"". There are tons of good southern rock songs that must be available for this type of CD. I don't know who thought up the title, but I want an ounce of whatever he/she was smoking."
3,capONE-E,"I DONT EVER LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM. FIRST, THE ONLY SONGS THAT I LIKED ARE THE OLDIE CUTS WITH BRENTON WOOD AND THE ORIGINALS. OTHER THAN THAT, I DONT REALLY FEEL ANY OF HIS STUFF- BEATS, LYRICS, FLOW. NOT MY TYPE, BUT HE IS DEFINITELY GETTING MORE ATTENTION AFTER HE DROPPED THIS OUT. -"
5,Yummy,Great treat for turtles. Mr. Puddles loves this as a treat. I mix this in with other foods and he picks these out to eat first.
2,Not for carpet at all,"I bought and returned this item. It did nothing at all on my carpet, even though it claims to be for bare floors to low carpet. It might do ok on bare floors, but -- to be honest -- that's not what I bought it to do and I didn't even bother to try it there after my disappointment with its performance on the carpet."
2,Not good on carpeting,"I found that the Zoombot worked on our kitchen floor, but not well at all on carpeting. We will be returning this to the store we purchased it at tomorrow."
3,Black & Decker RV500 Zoombot Remote-Control Vacuum,"This vacuum cleaner is mostly for use on bare floors -- it does an okay job. However, on carpets/rugs it doesn't do as good. After letting it run on my carpet for a good while, it still didn't get all the fuzzies & dirt that an uprite would.All in all, I rate it ""okay."""
1,abyssmal,"Absolutely an insult to the film making genre. If film had a filthy insult word to describe it, it would be ""Barbarian"". If I could give negative stars I would. Unforgiveable insult to the film world."
5,Great setup,Ive been thinging about replace my old wire cables I can't tell you how many times Ive been stuck. I was worried about the length but I'll over come that if I ever need it.
2,Not impressed,"This leaf storage bag is not impressive. I has the thickness (or should I say thinness) of your typical oilcloth tablecloth only it has a zipper. I store my leaf under my couch in this bag so it is out of harm's way. But if I had to rely only on this storage bag, I would buy a bigger size and wrap my leaf in an old blanket before zipping it up in this. Other than keep dust out, on its own, it's really not going to protect your leaf from much of anything."
2,Shallow water,"Dating from 1966, this film was designed mainly as a vehicle for some leading TV actors of that time. The storyline involves a team of oceanographers setting up a network of underwater sensors. The premise of this film exemplifies the optimism about scientific discovery that was common in the early 1960s, although ironically, there are some serious scientific mistakes. Because the plot is so sparse, the film is mainly a collection of episodes. The characters are for the most part rather simplistic. The film's best asset is some spectacular underwater photography, but in the end the nice visuals are not really enough to sustain interest."
1,Around the world under the sea (Amazon instant video),"Around the World under the SeaI am so upset that this movie is not in widescreen, like it said on here for the DVD sale. I bought this to own, so me and my family would enjoy this wonderful movie. I am just so disappointed at Amazon that we can't watch it in it's original glory on Instant Video. Total Shame."
3,Teaching Young Adult Literature: Sharing the Connection (Education),A well thought out book but not what I was particularly looking for. It would work well for introductory material for those searching for pedagogical materials.
1,Don't do it. This thing is bad news.,"I bought this heater and returned it because it did not work properly and the advertising is misleading. Regardless of the temperature setting, it shut off only minutes after being turned on. The photos of it are deceptive. In the photos, the finish appears chrome. In reality, it's a metallic metallic grey finish on the sides, with chrome feet, top and ends. There is no ""vintage cloth cord."" Instead it has a thick black plastic cord. It's poorly made, feels cheap and has sharp edges on the feet that WILL scratch wood floors. Make no mistake, this heater will leave you cold."
2,Disappointing,"Shortly after I got this product, the thermostat in the Max Heat option blew out. So, I can only use the Min Heat option (only 2 options) and it will stay on for days - no problem. This is obviously too bulkly to easily ship back to Amazon - and I didn't keep the huge cardboard box that covered the manuf. box. Wouldn't do it again for that reason."
1,Good while it worked! Broke after 2 months! (10 days of actual useage),"Good while it worked! But not for large rooms. Broke after 2 months! (and I only used it for mabye 10 nights total) It is now a fashionable paper weight. I do not recommend this heater or the DeLonghi brand (this is the second heater from them that has given me problems - 8 years ago a heater i had of theirs caught on fire!!!!) I now do not trust this company at all. I will now try Vornado. I do give credit to Amazon for taking it back after 2 months. I dont know if I have had bad luck or what, but I dont feel a heater should stop working after 10 days of use. It should last years....Maybe things are not built the way they were 20 - 30 years ago.I will say that this is a nicely designed heater but made with very cheap pot metal... (take a close look at it if you choose to order it - look inside) I think more $ went into the design rather than function. (thermostat was not very accurate either)"
3,Download was so frustrating I never got the album.,Couldn't figure out how to navigate the download process. AMZ gave me my money back but I never got the product that I wanted and no one ever asked me if I still wanted it.
5,BETTER THAN CHOCOLATE,"THIS ALBUM IS BETTER THAN CHOCOLATE. I AM COMPLETELY ADDICTED AND AM LEARNING TO PLAY THE SONGS ON MY GUITAR. And again, another of Warren's albums is helping me to sleep. The man has magic, is magic, will always be magic!!If you want to listen to the real stuff, this is it. I was so young when the song ""I Will Follow You"" was out I barely remember it, but I do REMEMBER IT.Want to listen to a Warren at the age of 23 who's voice is completely untarnished by cigarettes or anything else that one might smoke?? Here it is...Lovely. Not that the all of Warren's music isn't lovely, but maybe some of it is funky lovely, sarcastically lovely..I could go on and on but I won't. You all know what I mean if you know what I mean??Lady Warrior"
1,This DVD is awful,This DVD is awful. I had been waiting for this DVD for weeks and was really excited too see it. It's really unprofessionally done and just wrongfully stated at times. I will keep it only because I am such a fan of Beyonce's But I will probably never watch it again. Not even worth 1 $.
2,No official Vista support,I did a lot of research hoping to avoid any issues when purchasing a PCMCIA video card to drive a second monitor out of my ThinkPad X61 tablet. Unfortunately the information I got about its ability to play with Vista wasn't 100%. They have a beta driver if you can wait for it from a link via tech support but could never get it to work regardless of what I tried or they suggested. Settled for a Tritton external USB video adapter but the 1600x1200 shows a nice shade of fuzziness. Seems I can't get it just rigt.
5,Very Durable for the Potty Trainer,"So far so good. My 2.5 year old is potty training and I have had to wash this quite a few times in the past 2 months. It has held up nice. The comforter shrunk a little in the dryer, and actually fits better to the crib mattress."
1,Awful product - very poor quality,"I was excited to get this set today, but after I washed it, the excitement was gone. The sheets are very poor quality. The fitted sheet is too small, the flat sheet is printed upside down and they are very, very wrinkly after just one wash (and they were removed promptly from the dyer). The comforter is also very wrinkly. You will be sorry you bought this set. I got two sets (I have twins) and they are both of the same poor quality. Not worth the money - not even close."
2,"Olive Kids Trains, Planes, & Trucks Toddler Comforter Bed Set","ASIN:B000IXL454 Olive Kids Trains, Planes, & Trucks Toddler Comforter Bed Set]] The picture associated with the item makes it look like a twin bed. I did not realize it was toddler size. When I received it, the comforter looked like the size of a baby blanket and the sheet was the size of a hankerchief. I don't even feel that would fit on most todder beds. You need to show the bed as the size of a shoebox so people realize how small it is.[["
3,Disappointed,"I bought these from amazon and am extremely disappointed. These are not as pictured or described. My package did not have the 4 black and white ""co-molded"" links. Instead I received 2 all white links and 2 all black links. Given the fact they still function as links and are not worth having to spend the money to send them back I am forced to keep them. I bought these links because babies are attracted to contrasting black and white. Oh well. If you are hoping for what is in the picture. Do not Buy!"
4,Buy this for The Shizit,"The Shizit's cover of 'Just One Fix' is reason enough to buy this album. It's the hard, raw, and violent sound of hell itself, definitely a proper cover track. The rest of the CD comes second to the now defunct Shizit, but is worth a listen as well. Recommended."
1,The Saint,"I read this book through, not long before Mr Beckwith passed away in prison. I found this very one sided, Medgar Evers is shown to be a saint, an angel on Earth, while Byron De La Beckwith is shown at EVERY turn to be a warped, crazy person. Anyone hoping for fair reporting here will be out of luck. Remember, Mr Beckwith was tried twice and had a hung jury. It wasn't until the late twentieth century, with the PC climate, that he was found guilty. At that point there was no way he would have been found not guilty."
2,AT&T Model 2300 Expandable Phones,I purchased a base unit and two phones in approx. 1995.We have used the phones successfully and have rubbed off the numbers and letters from the keys.I purchase three hand sets to replace the two well worn handsets.The replacement handsets have display problems. Some vertical and horzontial parts of the display do not display. The cause is the separation of the display panel from the electrical contacts of the screen.I am disappointed that an AT&T; product would have such a major flaw.I will probably disassemble our old handsets and see if I can swap the rubber key pad with the old phones that do not have a display problem.
1,unit is bad,i got TWO (2) full units bc i couldnt find handset at storewas good until..BOTH LCD screens died on BOTH handsetsthe system like a bus marquee made of boxes now half text is missing like if battery died and replacing it didnt fix itall i get is ]-[ = L l 0 example most text is gonei experienced this with organizers when batt dies but ...\also sound is horrible and crackly
5,Long lasting and great size!,"I'm about to put this playpen away after using it for almost 5 years and 3 kids. It has been great and held up all these years. The only con is I hate that there was no way to clean the bottom ""pad"". I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a playpen."
3,slopes toward the center,"Overall I adore this playpen. It is bright, well made and sturdy but the reason I gave it 3 stars is that it has a terrible slope toward the center. Our baby tries to roll over and always rolls back into the center where it is low. One time she rolled to the center placing her head lower than her feet. This scared me so I feel we can only use it when we are sitting right beside the playpen watching her. January 2013. We are still using this playpen and it has held up well. Our daughter who is 16 months now still loves this and it has no damage after a full year of daily use."
5,Best pack and Play EVER!,My mother in law had an extra of this pack and play from previous grandchildren. We love it! I keep it in my trunk because we use it anytime we go anywhere. My mom recently purchased this one through Amazon with free shipping! It arrived the very next day and it's adorable. This one is so much nicer than the other (more expensive) one we have because our son who is now 15 months has much more room in it and the bottom is much more comfortable to sleep on. It's not as hard as our other pack and play. I really think this is a MUST HAVE for all moms!
5,Best Money spent to date!!!,"My friend had bought this pack and play and when my son and I went to visit for a play date I was amazed at how content he was playing in the playpen. I quickly went online to buy one for my home and he is in there now as I am online. I have more free time to do dishes and sweep and do laundry, all while I watch him of course. It has the mirror which he loves to look at and giggle, the butterfly wings he likes to teethe on, simply put money well spent! I am completely satisfied with my purchase and would tell every mom to invest in one!!!!"
4,Awsome Playpen,"This playpen is much bigger then the other PackNPlays and is easy to take apart so you can carry it upstairs, downstairs or to another home altogether. This playpen doesn't come with the changing area and sleep area but I didn't need it and if you don't either it will give your baby so much more room to enjoy themselves. The only reservation I have, is that I can't find a dome so I can leave it outside and not have to worry about the mosquitos in the summertime."
5,what a godsendd !!!,"I really am very pleased with the pack and play PLAYYARD that i recently purchased from Amazon.com/ I take care of my 2 grandsons and the youngest is a little over 1 yr and not walking. Well to be very honest, I am a little too old to be chasing the little one all over my house. (he is really FAST ). When my kids were his age, I did have the conventional playpen which allowed me to get things done around the house and this always worked out well. When I was looking for something similiar, all I could find was the pack and play...more or less just for napping or staying over nana's house..This is not what I wanted..To my surprise as I was on my computer I saw this playard and the picture caught my eye. I read on and after seeing the dimensions, I ordered it and am very happy with it..Not only is it roomy enough to let him play but it also is a great little place to nap...Nana's out there...............Go for it!!!!!"
4,Cheerful and Safe,"This pack and play is bright and cheerful, good quality and most of all safe! I am very pleased with this purchase and so is my little guy!"
5,Spacious and entertaining playard,"This playard has been wonderful for my twin daughters. It is easy to assemble and is quite spacious. The built in toys are great for babies. The butterfly wings rustle and jingle when my daughters kick at them. And the ladybug squeaks. If you are looking for a big playard, this is a great choice."
5,Great for the brand GRACO - Hurray!,"I love this product in all respects, except for the four paneled padded flooring.The design of it tends to not lay flat, once you put a sheet or a cover on it.This is a real flaw in the design. AND, it is super important that you follow thedirections for putting this up, and be sure to use the velcro straps to securethe flooring pad in place. Just get the help of another person to secure thevelcro straps, and you will be all set. Otherwise, I do like the sturdiness of theside rails, and the bright primary colors. Not the best for napping, as thebaby will continuously play with the built in side toys. Some of the toysrattle and crinkle, and once baby finds the party, they will not want to laydown to nap. But I still love this playyard so much, I bought two of them!"
5,THE BEST PACK N PLAY. VERY BIG,"I came across this pack n play in Amazon after searching everywhere for a Pack N Play that would last my baby for at least the first year.Everything I saw at Babies R Us was too small, so I decided to take a chance on this one. I was extremely pleased when I received it.It came already assembled, looks beautiful and is big and very durable. Can't beat that.I hightly recommend it."
4,Fun,"Still using this... its big and he doesn't mind going in it for me to shower. We also have used it to help him calm down, if he throws a fit we just sit him in with a toy and tell him when he is ready we will get out. Works well, just walk away and he calms down without an audience. Then we get back out, also when I tell him I want him to go in so I can take a shower he goes to it and waits to be put in. So he definately doesn't mind. He likes the toys in it too, wheres the baby (the mirror) was a favorite."
4,Great for teaching!!!!!!!,I'm a kindergarden teacher in Chicago. I grew up in Mexico listening to CriCri's music and I love it! But this DVD with a female voice is easier for kids to sing along with. I highly recommend this product for kids who want to learn spanish. Also to keep the spanish language alive in families with a latin backround.
2,TOO ABSTRACT FOR TODDLERS,For parents that are nuts for wooden vs plastic toys this may be a good substitute. The 2 1/2 year old I purchased it for didn't want to play with it whereas the toy horses that are more life like he loves!
1,Real problems with these things,"My dogs love authentic bully sticks. They can really tell the difference between the real thing and fakes. Perhaps these braided sticks were just poorly cured, and then masked with ""barbecue"" taste. Nevertheless, my dogs showed total indifference toward 18 out of the 20 I bought. They are never this way with real ones. This is the second time that I have gotten inferior (or fake rawhide) bully sticks online (two different companies). I'm going to stick to Trader Joes, where I can get genuine bully sticks at a reasonable price without sacrificing quality."
3,Trades off depth for breadth,"For a layperson like myself, the Merck Vet Guide is a handy reference book to have at hand. The writing is terse and concise, as you would expect from a guide for professionals. As such it (unsurprisingly) uses dense medical terminology, and is not beginner-friendly.However, in it's breadth of coverage, it necessarily skims the surface of most of it's topics. So, someone looking for in-depth information on any given topic will likely be disappointed. I suspect few vets (or advanced vet students) ever consult the MVM very often in their practice due to this limitation.Further, constant advances in diagnosis and treatment will plague any printed guide, such as this, that will inevitably be dated as soon as it is printed.But those are the inevitable constraints of writing a comprehensive guide such as this. All in all, it is a worthwhile book for the technically-inclined layperson or vet student to have at hand."
5,The vet student's bible,There's a reason my friends and I refer to this as the vet bible; it has an incredible amount of information stated concisely in an easy-to-find format. HIGHLY recommended.
1,Warning...,"SPOILER ALERT, if you care...the heroine is raped in this book (not by the hero, thankfully, but still) I had been enjoying the book but this *highly unnecessary* plot device ripped me right out of the story and I was so disappointed. It may not bother many readers, but if you dislike rape in your romance as much as I do, I feel you should be given a heads-up. I wish I had known ahead of time..."
3,"Not a good copy, but...","Well, the good side of this edition is that the text is all here, including the diagrams and all. It's a rather nice, portable little edition, printed right-to-left as is the custom for Hebrew books.The down side is that it's a rather poor quality facsimile copy. Much of the text is written in extremely small print, and it can be extremely difficult to make out the letters in many places. Alot of the text is either too dark or too light to read. Many letters appear smeared or blobbed together from the photocopy.That said, this is still the best copy you're likely to find. I've been searching for a while for any copy of this book, and this is the only copy I've been able to find. Parts of the text are readable, and the diagrams are perfectly legible. If you really want a copy of this book, this is the best you're likely to find.But if you do find a better copy, please let me know!"
5,In a Dark Wood,A very educational book. I always suspected the eco-freak wackos & even some of the so-called scientists were not following true scientific principles.
2,ignorant and angry but useful,"Chase's angry critique of ""environmentalists"" and their myths of nature has its points, but he ignores most of the substantial efforts to manage our ecosystem holistically -- e.g. including land, people, and money. He criticizes ""biocentrism"" but many of us recognize that human life, for example, is totally dependent on other organisms, E. coli to start. The question is not hierarchy, but interdependence.Hundreds of pages on what's wrong in my edition, and only two pages that mention possible pathways to the future in the form of the Quincy Library Group and Applegate Partnership."
1,I can't believe someone actually advocates hitting dogs!,"I bought this book because I recently adopted a rottweiler-lab mix puppy and I need all the help I can get. I thought this book looked like a good start. (I already have another, smaller, milder, gentler, female dog, and have trained her successfully). And I did find some good tips. But I was shocked by the author's suggestion to hit a dog with: 1. the flat of your hand. 2. a large children's book. 3. a ""jump-bat"" I thought those training methods went out with Descartes! I could never hit a dog, especially on the head, as she suggests. Those parts of the book made me literally sick to my stomach."
1,Better title would be 101 ways to abuse your dog.,"The author takes a very disturbing look on the world and on dog training. Besides thinking that motorists take great delight on hitting dogs that are on a leash with their owner she uses a heavy handed approach in her training. Save your money and invest in a book that teaches how to train your dog through positive reinforcement and not abuse, your dog will thank you."
2,Look for something better,I purchased the AT&T 2325 after having another AT&T cordless machine for years. This model disappointed. Sound quality was poor. The machine doesn't value your time when reviewing messages. It takes too much time to maneuver. Requires that you listen to time stamp with each play. The buttons are not sensitive enough. Takes too many tries to recognize remote access code. Will be returning for another machine.
1,does not work!!!!! do not buy!!!!!!!!!,"When the airplane went for takeoff,the airplane hit the ground in a second.The second time,one of the propellers did not work.Don't waste your money!"
1,Dickies 8953 painters bib overall white,Those overall are completely uncomfortable. I bought size which suppose to fit me easily and it's too tight !!!(hallo! overalls!). Fabric is rough and not nice and they are heavy and not too good for painters who need more comfortable cover. I am really dissatisfied with those overalls.
2,"Great Concert, Awful Sound","The Concert is great, typical Buddy/Junior Gig full of great music and energy, harp and guitar fantastic. But the sound on the first few tracks, especially on ""Stormy Mondy"" is so bad, it is not to be understood why it was released.There are many great recordings of these two fabulous blues-artists, but this bad bootleg is only to be recommended for the die-hard fan or completist.This being said, I can admit that I am both, when it comes to these two genuises. I enjoy the record, but it reminds one of sitting way too far in the back of a badly engineered concert.BEWARE!"
2,Disappointing...,"After giving this CD one listen I can say that an otherwise great performance was not recorded well. It seems like the horns were closer to the mic than the guitar or the harmonica. The vocals are muddy sounding and really weren't recorded well at all. The last three ""bonus tracks"" are studio recordings and don't feature Junior Wells either, so overall this release was a disappointment to me."
3,"Good music, bad recording","This music is actually really good. Smouldering guitar playing from Buddy Guy, and great renditions of ""Stormy Monday"", ""Leave My Girl Alone"" (which is oddly titled ""Woman Blues"" on the cover), and ""Messin' With The Kid"" - in addition to a horrible ""Satisfaction"".But the vocals are terrible. Not badly sung, you understand, but badly recorded, at times impossible to understand unless you know the words by heart. The only exceptions are the three bonus tracks, and they are studio tracks, not live recordings.This is rather strange, since most of the instruments are decently recorded, but the vocal tracks vary from bad to awful, making this an album for dedicated fans only.2 1/2 stars."
1,Very poor recording quality,The recording quality of this cd is extremely poor. The vocal tracks are barely audible at times. When you turn the volume up to hear some of the vocals you run the risk of distortion when some very high peaks in the music occur.
4,Like Gold,"The Study Game is so incredible, I wish I would have known all these secrets when I applied for my Doctoral Degree. I am definitely going to use the techniques in my dissertation on Cross Cultural Communications. All my students at Lopez High School are using it. They are our future leaders."
2,so so,This book was not as deep as I'd expected it to be. Quite a bit of author's self reflective fluff.
4,This is NOT an outline of Christianity!,"But you know what? That's ok. This is not a complete guide to Christian theology. So if that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere. This book has a specific point: the movement of Christianity. And Bell makes good observations about how Christianity has moved and shifted and flexed in order to meet the knowledge that we are gaining theologically, scientifically, spiritually, and socially. To do otherwise runs the risk of stagnation and extreme amputation of the Church from being in the world. Many may see Bell as being on one end of the ""conservative/liberal"" continuum, but regardless, his perspective is worth investigating. It's not for everyone, and plenty of people will be giving this book one star before they're through with the 1st chapter. But if you're willing, this book might cause you to rethink what Christianity is and how it functions. Happy reading!"
4,An Appeal to Think,"I consider myself theologically conservative. While some reviews portrayed the book as a liberal treatise, I did not see it in this way. What I took away most from the book is the need to continuously challenge, re-think, and revisit doctrine. Bell also did a good job of putting things in context.If you are dogmatic about your interpretation of the Bible, whether liberal or conservative, this is not a book with which you will agree. But the biggest point in the book is challenge and thinking. Bell gets this point across well."
5,FREAKING AWESOME!!!!,"Velvet Elvis is a very good book. Especially for thoughs who are repulsed and reluctant to go to church for fear of condemnation. His books defines christianity. It brings the fun back into for a newer and younger generation. It is a book which is ""bibicly naked"" meaning it is real. It is not hiding anything. He tells you how to be a christian. It shows what should be in the core, and what should be on the outside. I recomend this book who is really struggling with why they beleive what they beleive. FREAKING AWESOME!!!!!!!!"
4,What is your purpose...,"When I first read this book I would've rated it maybe 3 1/2 stars. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the good and entertaining read, but I was expecting something a little more uhmm... explosive. The writing style is amazing, and the content is well thought out, but lacked a genuine newness. Then time passed on, and I was searching for something to help break down the theological walls for my church. I turned to this book because it was easy enough to pick up and understand, and it is somewhat like a brief introduction to the christian faith.This leads to my conclusion that if you're looking for that new explosive book look elsewhere, but if you want to step into what the Christian faith is about then this is your best bet...I would put this as the new framework for apologetics."
1,Reader beware... have Bible in hand.,Mr. Bell has an interesting way with words. He is a good story teller. But be weary of falling for his tricks. He may mislead you. Be sure to double-check everything with scripture. I'm not saying the whole book is crap... but overall I am afraid that it has misled many many into accepting a false-type of Christianity. May God save them all!
5,"I have become not only a better Catholic, but a better Christian.","This book is beautifully written. I have become not only a better Catholic but a better Christian. Rob writes with a guided hand to help truly Re-paint the Christian Faith. Finding truth where truth is, is one of the thoughts that help unite Gods people, not just those that consider themselves People of God. It is a much bigger picture than we can see, Velvet Elvis truly helped me to see even more of that picture!!"
5,One of the BEST books I have ever read!,"Rob Bell teaches you things about Jesus in this book that would never occur to you. You will read it and say, wow, now that makes sense. Maybe they are obvious things that you just never thought of but Rob Bell reveals them to you in such a way that you will never forget them. I highly recommend this book as well as his second book- ""Sex God"". These books will change your life."
1,Robe Bell is a Fruit Cake,"To equate Bell with the Reformers is like comparing the living and the dead. Bell is a Pelagian in his understanding of sin and redemption. People will love this book who have no clue about their own depravity and of God's demands of justice. The cross of Christ is meaningless to Bell and his followers.Just take a look at his little talk with the Dahli Lama a few ago. Luther would have had more to say, and would have taken Bell's little [...] out for a serious whipping.Give us a break Bell. This sheep has another Master."
3,Locking Gas Caps,They are fine except that they don't fit. You are allowed to check to see if they will fit your year and model car or truck but even if they say they'll fit...they don't. Returns are easy but its still wasted time
1,HORRIBLE! DO NOT BUY!!!,"First of all, this locking fuel cap doesn't fit my 2008 Honda Element... I only purchased because there's the green check with the words ""this product fits your 2008 Honda Element"" on top of the page. Not only I wasted money on something that won't fit my car, the cap is now stuck in my gas tank, which means I can't fill up my gas tank anymore, thank god I still had a little bit of gas left in the car or else I'm doomed. Took the car to my mechanic he told me if they break any part trying to pull the fuel cap out it'll be an easy $500...So I bought a $10.38 locking fuel cap and now ending up to spend around $500 to fix.Lesson learned, I'm completely upset at myself for buying this piece of sh*t."
5,great product,This phone is clear and easy to use ...have had a couple and have not been disapointed
5,A brilliant series of essays,"Rogin is always interesting and the essays collected in this volume are no exception. Dense and fascinating, the book is full of insights into what Rogin calls the countersubversive tradition in America (and on many other things as well). In other reviews posted here, there are arguments over his politics (which are, indeed, on the left). The problems I have with this book have more to do with Rogin's Freudianism. Nevertheless, even if you don't accept the full weight of the phallic significance of Civil War swords for D.W. Griffith, you'll still get fascinating insights into BIRTH OF A NATION. A book everyone interested in 20th century American political culture should read, even if they don't end up agreeing with it."
2,Eddie on Fender Rhodes,This is Eddie on Fender Rhodes. The fidelity really isn't very good but the band cooks. for the serious fan only
2,Highly overrated book,"This book is biased, repetitive and Maggi contradicts herself througout. I don't thinks she writes effectively as an anthropologist, if she can admire and appreciate one culture so much, why and who gives her the right to deride any of the neighboring cultures? She wastes a lot of paper just by repeating what she has already said before as if trying to convince herself of those statements. And at times the reader is just confused because she makes statements and then immediately contradicts them. She's just another tourist in awe of an exotic culture who picked up some of the language while she visited."
3,"Good, affordable telecom module for structured wiring","I installed this for its intended purpose in our new structured wiring closet. Phone line goes into one jack, and the other 12 connect to the wiring in the house.Only issue is mounting it. One can purchase a bracket from OnQ/Legrand that this clips into, but that doubles the cost. And it uses these proprietary plastic ""rivets"" that appear to connect it easily but mean that it's hard toconnect to anything else. The included mounted bracket holds only one end, not both, so it hangs a little loose."
3,h owner,"This book has lots of pictures of tractor shows but almost nothing about the workings of the tractor. If you want pictures then this for you, but if you want info forget this one."
4,"""A Cool Million"" is great!","Having read all four of West's novels, I feel that ""A Cool Million"" is easily the greatest of his works. It presents a sarcastic and cynical view of life in America during the 1930's. The novel is, by the way, a modernization of ""Candide,"" by Voltaire, and it is still fresh after sixty-five years. West is second only to Mark Twain in identifying and attacking society's corruption and vices. The book only gets four stars, however, because it also includes West's worst novel, ""The Dream Life of Balso Snell,"" which is a complete waste of his talents. ""Balso Snell"" is completely disjointed and unorganized. The main character wanders around inside of a wooden horse and meets various allegorical losers. Now you do not have to read ""Balso Snell"", because I have just told you the entire story. That the author could produce two works which are such polar opposites in quality and readability is surprising. Buy this book for ""Cool Million"" - you will not regret it!"
5,excellent buy and price,"It made my day, this was an excellent find, I could never have made it through nursing school without this fine book of high knowledge"
2,Full Moon Volume II Inspected,"Although I like the movies in this collection as well as many other Full Moon features, the product arrived in poor condition. The only DVD the was not scratched was ""Robot Wars"". Thankfully, that's the movie I really wanted. The DVD ""Invisible"" was missing altogether, yet it was replaced by a second copy of ""Mandroid"". The other copy of ""Mandroid"" is so badly scratched, it is not viewable. ""Dark Angel"" was scratched, but after some cleaning, it was viewable. The final DVD ""Lurking Fear"" is also scratched, but I hope it will be salvageable with some cleaning. I like Full Moon's movies, but this product arrived in inexcusably poor condition. I'd give it a D-."
2,Not annotated,"I was very disappointed when I ran across this book - although it looks like it has lots of really great and hard-to-find information, there are no sources credited for where the info came from, where the drawings are from or anything. Sadly that makes it useless to me in pursuit of replication of authentic medival clothing. If only the author had annotated it..."
3,Solo it is,"Honestly this cd ain't bad, it has it's beats and it's melodies the tracks that i found worth listening to where:That girlClubbingPop that bootyGood luckTempted andActin' upOther than that I skip over the tracks, i guess they're not bad but i just can't get into them. I personally don't like the remixes and i don't think they should have been included. But if you're a huge MH and Imx fan you'll love it"
1,why I voted so low,because you jackasses wouldn't let me hear any of the album so how can I really rate it!?
2,The theif who stole a week.,"What a stinker! I loved Richard Steinberg's first novel, The Gemini Man. The concept was great and the writing was superb. His sophomore effort, however, leaves much to be desired. The story timeline jumps rapidly from one point in time to another a few months away. Apparently, everything that happens in between is insignificant and only needs be recapped. This ""time-warp"" effect slows down the pace of the novel in that the reader now has to read a ""re-cap chapter"". Also, the overall driving secret of the novel is not really that great. It's been done before. And done and done and done and done and done. Overall, this book is mediocre at best. Richard Steinberg should stick to covert-ops style books like The Gemini Man and The 4 Phase Man. Both of those novels were significantly better than this. I highly recommend those and highly recommend you stay away from Nobody's Safe."
3,Good and simple,"Good simple book for new sailors or helpers (3rd mates)Got it for a friend to help me, but not to take over command.I have even been corrected for using the word Rope instead of LineIf you learn everything in this book, you will be a very knowledgeable sailor"
4,"intermediate, not for dummies","An excellent reference, with chapters that address things you will need to know, but didn't know you needed to know. But, I found that it was so comprehensive, that the ""Annapolis"" book was a better beginning how-to-sail guide, this book was more of an intermediate reference. Minor note: the diagram on p. 366, How to Tie a Figure-Eight Knot (Figure 19-2), is incorrect."
4,"Pleased overall, even after 5 years","I've had this printer for about 5 years now, and I've never been unhappy with it. The print quality is very good, it is easy to use, and mine apparently has quite the lifespan. The only problems I run into now are the incompatibility of the scan function with Windows Vista (rather than just pressing the ""Scan"" button, you have to open up Windows Photo Gallery and manually import an image before it will scan) and random malfunctions where it won't do anything, and I have to completely uninstall and reinstall it. Those are very frustrating, but I think they're also linked to Vista. HP didn't make any Vista-compatible drivers for this printer.Overall, I've been very pleased and will keep using this printer until it dies."
1,I hate hate hate this printer.,"1. Paper Jams all the time2. Takes forever to print 1 document3. Is big, clunky and noisy.I am turned off HP printers forever"
2,WARNING! WILL NOT PRINT LABELS!,"This printer is great if you use only regular paper. I recently bought a Memorex lablemaker to do home dvds. The printer rollers will not feed the labels the same every time. So you will waste about 5 pages of labels to get one. I called Memorex and HP and both said that the all-in-one printer will not feed labels right, and their is no solution."
2,No grayscale printing - why? why? why?,"Pros: very good color printing, seems better than my Canon i320.Cons: no grayscale support by the driver. This is inexcusable to me. Don't say that you get what you pay for. Even the cheapest of cheap printers can do this. There is a work around (remove the color cartridge), but that's lame. Also, everytime I remove its system tray program, I get a GPF-type error.If grayscale printing were supported, it would be a 4-star."
4,BIG binding posts!,"Nicely made binding posts, good for DIY speakers where you want to use heavy-gauge ""monster"" speaker cables. But be aware that they are a lot larger than they might appear in the photos. The holes in the sides are 5/16"" diameter, and the hole in the top accepts a standard banana plug. If you're considering these plugs for reproductions or re-builds of antique radio/electronics (which is why I bought them) you might find them too big for aesthetic purposes."
5,A hard to find classic.,"Here is a near impossible to fine CD. Very limited in production, available only from Japan and very expensive. The tracks are typical Wakeman greatness. The Birdman of Alcatraz is a stunning piece of work. Chambers of Horrors shows Rick's creativity especially in the ending scream. There is a funny story about it. All in all, a must for the Wakeman devotees. Good luck tracking one down."
2,"eh, whatever.","I bought this cookbook expecting it to have a few fun, easy recipes for wraps that I could toss together with stuff I had around the kitchen. Although the recipes and certainly the pictures look delicious, fun and easy they're not. It's not uncommon for recipes to have over a dozen ingredients. When I want to toss together a little lunch, I don't have time to track down 1/4 cup chopped pickled ginger or 2 cups cooked jasmine rice or 1/4 teaspoon orange oil. I have yet to make a single recipe from this book, despite having owned it for over nine months."
2,It leaks!,This was supposed to be the best!Saveuer said it was but some reviews said it leaked. It does. At the seam between the upper part and the bottom insulated glass part. After mixing and pouring through the strainer top the shaker leaks at the seam and leaves a puddle on the counter which is part of your 2nd drink.No problem if you remove complete top but who wants to do that? Too bad - it is a design flaw and should be fixed.
3,Stainless Steel Rusts at the seam inside the shaker,"I like the design, rubber top, tight fit, and size, but this shaker has a design flaw. The dual walled stainless steel shaker has a micro seam inside the lip of the shaker at the top where the inner and outer surface join. After one use and one wash in the dish washer, the seem was covered in rust. I did a quick steel wool scrub to remove and put it away. A week later, another large orange ring of rust circles the inside of the shaker. Looks like the seam welds are not very good. My two other brands of walled stainless steel shakers have never rusted.As for leaks, I have had no issues. Cap and jigger fit tight. Double walled design is nice for keeping condensation to a minimum, but it makes removing the lid difficult at times when it chills and contracts and becomes to tight to remove."
4,Addressing the leaking issue,"I noticed that some people had leaking problems with this shaker, so I decided to go look at the product locally. Here's what I found:Because the shaker comes in an unsealed plastic case, you can take each shaker out and examine it. Some units have a top cap that fits nice and snugly onto the lid. Others have a very loose fit, with the top cap easily sliding on and off with almost no effort. I suspect these are the ones that may end up with leaking problems.My advice is to consider a local purchase so you can make sure you get a snug fitting unit. When you get one that works, it's an outstanding shaker. Great ergonomics, no leaking, and it never gets stuck together or otherwise does annoying things. I'm quite happy with mine."
4,Easy reading,"I am biased, since I helped Peter edit the chapters on enumerated types and genericity.I really like Peter's easy-reading style. You can curl up in bed and read the book cover to cover without getting bored or lost. He gives you short comic breaks at the end of each chapter.He uses easy to understand concrete examples, so you know without a doubt what the code is TRYING to do, as he introduces the language features one at a time. he also gives you the complete code, so you can try them out and experiment."
1,A Misleading Introduction !,I was misled by the book's introduction where the author has declared his book for beginners in Java. Most of the topics are covered in a very confusing fashion. This book can niether be used as beginner's learning tool nor a reference for experienced programmers. If you are beginner in Java don't buy this book !
3,"Just Java 2, 5th Ed","This book is not for beginners. The author does not begin talking about any programming until chap4. Furthermore, he keeps trashing Microsoft and other programming languages C, C++ and C#. If you wanna get a quickstart in programming Java, you will have to endure a lot of waiting. Otherwise, I think this book is interesting and comprehensive."
